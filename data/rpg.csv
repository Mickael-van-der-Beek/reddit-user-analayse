1360654490.0,894,self.rpg,18d80q,"Okay, everyone wanted more detail about the F.A.T.A.L. session, here you go.  [NSFW]. [NSFL]. [NS].  Seriously... do not read. ",samtravis,1137,243,215,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/18d80q/okay_everyone_wanted_more_detail_about_the_fatal/,"Since everybody wants it, I'll post what I recall about the session of F.A.T.A.L. we played.  It's been years so my memory is (thankfully) pretty fuzzy but here goes.

First, everyone showed up EXCEPT Jordon-who's-fault-this-whole-thing-was.  After phoning him up we learned that he'd been called in to work and would be late, but he told us it was okay and to just start without him.  Bastard.  So we started, and right from the get-go it was horrible.  There are primary stats in F.A.T.A.L., each of which is the average of some sub-stats, five I think.  Each sub stat is generated by rolling (4d100/2)-1.  Yep.  I sure hope you love doing averages in your head because you have to about 100 times to make a F.A.T.A.L. character.  Anyway you generate all of these substats by doing the above roll a LOT (even now that equation is seared into my memory, years later) and then you average each set of sub-stats to get each main stat.  Imagine what the room was like trying to get 10 people who'd never played this game to roll that many dice and do that much math in their heads or longhand.  It was chaos.  Yes we could have used calculators but I DID NOT ALLOW IT.  If I had to GM this pig they could do the fucking math the hard way.  Anyway that took about a fucking hour, mostly because I had to keep explaining it to them.  Then Jordan showed up.

He breezed in like it was no problem and had a hearty laugh at our expense, apologized for being so late, and told us to just go ahead and finish up without him.  ""Oh no.  No you sit your fucking ass down and catch up with us you greasy shithumper.  This whole thing is because of YOU!!"" We all said with our eyes (and some of us said it with our mouths too) while we fetched pencils and a blank sheet.  Now that we'd all done it, it went pretty well and after about 15 minutes he was all caught up.  Poor bastard.

Now came the ""skill modifiers"".  You have to look up each stat and find the skill modifier for skills keyed off of that stat.  They're mostly the same but the table is reprinted separately for each ability.  Seriously, there's like 40 pages of nearly identical tables after the stats section for these skill modifiers.  Also each entry on the table has a ""description"" that I think you're supposed to write down,  I don't remember.  I do remember that one of the descriptors for one of the dex-like stats was ""physical movement precision"" and it was all in fractions of an inch.  Retarded.  Some of that stats of course have multiple modifiers like ""maximum speech rate"" which is based off your enunciation stat which is naturally vitally important for casters.  Blerf. One of the characters' had for his language modifier ""undismayed"".  Also there is a rule for ""retard strength"" if a character's intelligence is below 70, so there's that.  (Of course nobody in my group qualified for said retard strength because the stats are so averaged, but it says a lot about the game that it's there, and that it's called ""retard strength.)

About now you're probably thinking ""this isn't so bad, sure the math is overly complex and the bizarre prediliction for averages will result in nearly-identical stats for most characters but it isn't all *horrible* or anything. You're right, at this point it isn't too bad... Leave now.  Seriously.  Stop reading this thread and go to /r/aww for a  while and never  come back.  You'll be better off for the rest of your life if you do, I'm not kidding.

Okay you chose poorly.   So next everybody chose their gender and race.   Under gender there's a whole bit where he basically recapitulates Aristotle's opinions on the differences between the sexes, and gives you modifiers to the stats based on them.  It's pretty sexist but not nearly as bad as you would expect based on the stuff you'll be putting on your character sheet in a few minutes so I gotta give props.  Now you just pick your race and apply the racial modifiers to your stats and you're done with statsOHWAITNOTREALLY!  Now a bunch of your secondary stats have changed haven't they? Guess what that means!  You get to re-average everything to re-derive your primary stats now, isn't that awesome!  Isn't it great that we get to do that all over again?  Interestingly enough there's a paragraph where the author apologizes for using the term ""race"" as that might be deemed inappropriate.  Bear in mind in a little bit you'll be generating the circumference of your asshole to determine how much dong it takes you rape you to death, so being concerned about the term ""race"" is... odd.  Anyway we did all of this without too much difficulty, just some groaning about having to re-derive all 20 (or whatever) stats.  Each race also has a few skill modifiers to jot down and some of them have random traits or special powers.  After the races were all chosen everyone had to record their races various hatreds for the other members of the group based on the race-hate table.  I also suggested that if their character had a particularly high racial hatred for another character's race they could note some of the racial slurs in the helpful list the game includes (One of which is ""stovepiper"" based on the thick dicks one of the races has, I forget which.)

The next chapter was called ""Body"" and is just page after page of tables to determine height, weight, hair color, all that bullshit.  It took us quite a while because it's needlessly detailed and largely nonsensical.  There are tables for everything.  I do remember we had a good laugh at the best feature/worst feature roll.  I think we had a Dwarf with really nice hair but whose worst feature was ""crotch"" so we ruled he was just really really hairy *everywhere*.  Good times.  There's also some  really critical shit in this chapter determined by single die rolls.  for example you roll percentile on the vision quality table at one point and if you roll low you're mostly blind and suck at hitting stuff. One of the players had already decided due to his stats to be mostly ranged but it turned out he couldn't see very well.  Sucked to be that guy.  

Then we hit the stuff F.A.T.A.L. is famous for.

Partway through the body chapter you run into the section about sexual characteristics.  They were just following along and and I said ""okay, now everybody roll for areaola diameter"".  You could have heard a pin drop for about 2 seconds and then laughter and chaos.   Once I got them calmed down they all rolled for that (modified by race of course) then areaola color and hue, then cup size and nipple *length*.  It was hilarious and deeply disturbing at the same time.  The results were hilarious, we were going around the table rolling for each thing and just cracking up laughing at every roll.   We had a troll with enourmous nipples and areaolas like appetizer plates but AA cup breasts.  One guy had a tongue that could touch the top of his nose.  Yes TOP, not tip.  He could almost lick his own eyebrows. Then there's vaginal circumference and depth, which is based on height if I recall correctly with a random percentage added on and then modified by race.  There are even modifiers to VCP based on whether the character is a mother, a nymphmaniac, or a slut.  FYI The modifier to vaginal circumference for being a slut is larger than the one for having given birth, ladies take note.  There's a similar table for ACP (anal circumference, potential) and that was fun for all because everybody has an anus, not everybody has a vagina.  We did some rough comparison and decided that one of the characters could possibly fit another completely inside their anus.  An immediate plan was hatched in case the larger player was ever sent to jail to smuggle the other one inside the larger's anus.  This is the kind of discussion you have while playing this game.  There's even a ""hymen penetration"" or ""hymen resistance"" table, I can't recall the exact name thank god.  There's a bunch of shit about menstruation and fertility rates and such.  Then we (mostly male players) got to the part we'd been waiting for: dicks. EDIT: shit, I forgot to mention this: on vaginal circumference there is a handy ""reference"" column that compares the various vagina size classes to the number of same-species fingers and/or fists that can be inserted therein.  Wow.

1363617975.0,559,self.rpg,1aixz6,Recently uncovered a Chekhov's gun four years in the making. Anyone's GM ever keep a HUGE secret for  LOOOONG time?,Lasergoose,654,95,179,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1aixz6/recently_uncovered_a_chekhovs_gun_four_years_in/,"My GM, possibly the best GM in the history of GMs, runs a game of Legend of the Five Rings. Setting: Sorta-Samurai in Sorta-Japan.

This is long but hopefully worth your time.

Thanks partly to a PC math error, our little world got invaded by the Moon. Long story, but the Moon is a deity in this universe. His forces begin with a few cultists, but eventually recruit a bunch of ronin, and soon we have actual defectors from the great samurai clans fighting for the enemy.

Factions form, split, reform. Long-dead threats rise to take their piece of the pie. Enormous battles ensue.

My party's job is to gather a group of what amounts to demigods in order to put an end to all this madness. It is a crappy job. High turnover rate. Thankfully, our benevolent GM came up with a new healing potion sold at a recently opened chain store we could find in almost any town. Due to his love of Engrish, he named the potion ""White Pearl Super Big Power.""

It's kind of expensive, but heals better than almost anything else on the market, and replenishes all your spent Void points (points you burn for an extra 1k1 on anything, among other benefits).

We started stocking up on this early on, using it very quickly, then running back to the store to get more. We use it to replace sleep, since sleep only heals you 1/3 as much.

The stuff works instantly, so a common maneuver in combat is to spend a round getting to a downed (useful) comrade and dumping a bottle of it down his throat, then leaving him with a few more so he can finish healing and get back up and fight. A round lasts about five seconds in-game, so this amounts to getting knocked unconscious for ten seconds, spending fifteen seconds or so shaking it off, then getting up and fighting at near-full capacity.

Crowning achievement: in combat, one PC figured out how to break physics with his bandoleer of these bottles:

1. Drink a White Pearl to heal some HP and get all his Void back.

2. Spend a Void to gain another action for the round.

3. Repeat until fully healed.

*And our GM allowed it.* (He did have this guy mind-raped by a miniboss immediately afterward as a not-so-subtle hint that maybe this sort of thing would draw the attention of our opponents. We occasionally do it anyway.)

I cannot even imagine how many gallons of this stuff we've ingested as we've trod through this worsening war, watching whole cities fall to the Moon, our centuries-old way of life obliterated, but knowing we need to live to fight another day, even if victory will be hollow by the time we achieve it.

Eventually we bought so much of this stuff that our GM had his little chain store start selling subscription bottles. We bought those, used them up in a day, and came back for refills.

Over the course of *four real-life years*, getting together anywhere from weekly to monthly, we marched through this campaign. Not one original party member remains, but we always swear in the new guys to continue fighting the good fight. And always, always, we stay stocked with White Pearl Super Big Power.

A week ago, my character, having suffered several concussions, and being out of his White Pearl, held the empty glass bottle up to the sky one evening to see if there was a single drop left in it. There was.

It was exactly the same color as the moon.

So what do I do?  I make them run a gauntlet of them!

The party enters a room.  It is a 30-foot cube chiseled out of a mountain.  The entrance door is to the south.  All other walls are smooth stone.  In the center of the room is a jar of beans on a pedestal.  If you inspect the jar, it is sealed shut.  A successful arcana check reveals that the jar is under a powerful enchantment.  A search of the room reveals that the north wall is not connected to the other walls.

Here's how the puzzle works.  If you guess the correct number of beans in the jar and call that number out loud, the north wall slides down into the floor, allowing you to continue.  However, if you guess wrong, the jar zaps you for damage equal to how far off your guess was.  So, if there are 345 beans in the jar and you guess 330, you take 15 damage.  You count the beans by making a perception check.  The higher the check, the more accurate your estimate.

For example, if this were 4E, if a member of the party rolled a 10 on his perception, the GM would tell him that there are between 300 and 400 beans in the jar.  A check of 15 would give him 320 to 380.  A check of 20 would give him 340 to 360, and so on.  Feel free to modify this part so it works for you.

You can't just take the beans out and count them, either.  If you break the jar, it reassembles itself like the T-1000 and make it back to the pedestal.  If you knock over the pedestal, it rights itself again.  If you try to hold a piece of the jar or eat one of the beans, it will shoot out of your body, through muscle and bone if necessary.

Trying to muscle the door down shouldn't work, either.  Unless your strength or athletics check is obnoxiously high, the door will only lower enough to fit a small creature through before springing itself back up.

So here's how my 3-man party approached the situation: they didn't have a fucking clue.  They tried smashing the jar.  They tried knocking it over.  They tried breaking the neck off.  They tried forcing the door.  They almost got somewhere with the door, but even together they couldn't put together enough strength to get it down.  So two of them lowered the door as far as they could, almost enough for a halfling to squeeze through.  Then the third grabbed the jar and hurled it through the crack.  The first two let go and everyone got out of the way, as the beans and shattered glass hurled back through the door, demolishing it.

But in my soon to be decade of TTRPGing (Mostly AD&amp;D 2e, and 3.5/D20) experience most of it spent behind a screen scheming I've found PCs and GMs have more fun if the PCs do certain things.


10. Have a Backstory: It doesn't have to be expansive a paragraph is usually enough to let everyone know the feel of your character. Like a list of characters for a play it should let everyone know your character's premise.
9. Improvise: Have your character ocassionally act on impulse and let the ramifications come. It surprises a GM and your fellow PCs and it keeps things fresh.
8. Now It's Personal: Grow attached to things. PCs naming their +2 returning Javelin ""Diplomacy"" adds a lot of flavor to simple things. Also if the same setting is ever revisited at a later time finding a relic from your past adventures is a lot of fun.
7. Be Quirky: Give your charecter flaws. And not just the suggested ones for bonus feats. Make your Monk OCD and spend ten minutes trying to organize the tomb of a Chaotic Evil guy. Have fun with it. Other PCs will laugh or hilariously try and stop you. Fun for all.
6. Keep it Simple Stupid: Don't make the GM dig through pages of rules for your actions. If the GM simplifies something deal with it rather than attempt rules lawyering. Speeds up play prevents you from time hogging and will make more time for fun.
5. Stay on Track: The first sidequest is awesome, the sidequest from that sidequest is questionable, after that its too much.
4. He Tasks Me: Choose someone you hate. Don't let other PCs know, pick an enemy and figure out why you loathe them.
3. Keep Secrets: Pass notes to the GM. Collude with another player. Make sure people pay attention to your character. (Don't hog the Spotlight though)
2. Stay on the Rails: The GM probably has something awesome planned. And the rails are not nessecarily bad.
1. Go off the Rails: The GM will be impressed and flustered the encounter will be more fun as its improvised and you shape the villian's plans as much as the GM making a fun exercise in team storytelling.

2: None.

3-4: One, a mother.

5-6: One, a father.

7-11: Both your mother and father.

12: None.
______________________________________________

**If you were left without parents, roll to see the circumstances surrounding your rearing.**

2-3: Both of your parents died shortly after your birth.  You were raised alongside dozens of other squalling children in an orphanage.

4-6: Your parents died when you were young.  You were taken into an orphanage and raised alongside others.  It was an existence of filth and misery. 

7-9: Your parents died and you were raised by a relative.  Although they were poor and could not well afford another mouth to feed, they were unwilling to abandon their blood.

10-11: Your parents died, and you were taken in by strangers.  It was a rare kindness in a cruel world.

12: Your parents abandoned you, perhaps out of hatred, perhaps out of pragmatism, or perhaps a small mercy to spare you from their wretched existence.  Roll again to see how you were raised.
_____________________________________________________

**You lived an ignoble life.  Subsistence was a struggle.  Roll to see how you made a living.**

2: You were sold into slavery.  Life was cruel and hard, and you suffered under the taskmaster's lash.  You scarcely made it out alive.  Immediately roll 2d6 again.  Once you have done so, roll 2d6 again to see how you made your living afterwards.

^(2:  You killed your master and diverted the blame from yourself.  You are free, but you will forever bear the scars of enslavement.)

^(3-4: In a moment of righteous fury, you overpowered your master and slew him.  You have left that life behind, but you are hounded by those close to him.)

^(5-9: You fled.  Your liberty is likely temporary, for your master and the authorities are seeking you out.  Slaves on the run seldom last long, and everyone could turn you in for a reward.  Be careful.)

^(10-11: You demonstrated some unusual value to your master.  He sold you into another profession, making a fair profit in the process.  Roll again on the table to see where you are now.)

^(12: Over the course of many years, you provided valuable service to your master, and you earned your freedom because of it.  Perhaps his heart was soft, or perhaps you managed to scrounge for shillings until you had enough to buy your freedom.  Either way, you are a free man.  Roll again on the table to see where you are now.) 

3-4: You became a prostitute, either due to financial hardship or coercion.  (If your character is a man, reroll this result.  There is little demand for male prostitutes.)  Even the finest brothel whores are treated with contempt, and you frequently suffered abuse and diseases.  You considered suicide on more than one occasion, but you were determined to live.  Immediately roll 2d6 again.

^(2-3: You attracted the attentions of a wealthy patron.  He purchased you for his personal service.  Roll on the table for slaves to see how you escaped.)

^(4: A young lad fancied himself in love with you.  Bullheaded and valiant as only young men are, he was determined to rescue you from a life of sexual indignity.  He helped you escape and was under the impression that you would wed him.  Alas, your master sought vengeance and had him killed.  You are on the run from those who would seek to recapture you.)

^(5: A youth with more wealth than wisdom thought himself your true knight and that you would be together forever.  He purchased your freedom and sought to be your husband.  It was an ideal arrangement for some time, but wanderlust stirred within you, and you were drawn to the life of an adventurer.  Now your husband is mooning over you and searching for his lost love.)

^(6-7: You toiled at the brothel until one day you could stand it no more.  You crept out one night and left to make your way in the world.  Pray that your master’s fury never finds you.)

^(8-11: You were unable to please your patrons in some way or another, and you owner cast you out on the street.  Roll again on the table to see how you made your living.)

^(12: You were unusually shrewd and managed to squirrel away enough money to buy your way out.  Freedom is fickle, however, so enjoy it while it lasts.)
	
4-5: You were a sword-for-hire.  The work was not always clean or morally upright, but it paid well.  Immediately roll 2d6.

^(2-3: You enlisted in the army of a lord.  There were thousands like you, all hoping for a better life, but few could have it.  You were just another face, just another sword arm.)

^(4-5: You served as a personal bodyguard for a time.  The amount of danger depended on the cunning and wickedness of your retainer.  A man with both in spades is dangerous but lucrative.)

^(6-8: You joined a mercenary group.  The pay was good, but the work was not.  Sell-swords are fodder for wicked men.)

^(9-10:  You became a thug, roughing up shopkeeps for a cut of their coin.  You worked alone or in a small group.)

^(11-12: You worked as an assassin, murdering for the right price.) 

6-7: You took on an apprenticeship (or perhaps someone took you on as an apprentice).  You learned a specific trade.  Immediately roll 1d8.

^(1: You worked as a tailor.)

^(2: You learned metalworking.)

^(3: You learned carpentry, including bowyering and fletching.)

^(4: You became a baker.)

^(5: You cut meat as a butcher.)

^(6: You bound and stitched books.)

^(7: You worked as a builder and stonemason.)

^(8: You molded clay and crafted pottery.)

^(9: You tanned hides as a leatherworker.)

^(10: You served as a squire to a low knight.)



8-9: You practiced a physical occupation.  Immediately roll 1d8.

^(1: You were a hunter and trapper.)

^(2: You sailed the seas, transporting goods along trade routes.)

^(3: You toiled as a farmhand.)

^(4: You were a ferryman and fisher.)

^(5: You trained as an acrobat, walking tightropes and entertaining crowds.)

^(6: You labored in mines deep underground.)

^(7: You were a ratcatcher, clearing rodent infestations from buildings and public areas.)

^(8: You acted as a town guard, watching over a village.)


10: You were fortunate enough to come into the service of a slightly higher social standing.  Immediately roll 1d8.


^(1: You kept numbers as a clerk.)

^(2: You served as an aid to a merchant.)

^(3: You practiced as a scribe and calligrapher.)

^(4: You learned herbalism, brewing teas and mixing poultices.)

^(5: You studied alchemy.  You never changed lead into gold, but you certainly tried.)

^(6: You were a minstrel, singer, or poet.)

^(7: You were inducted into a religious order and trained in their rites and beliefs.)

^(8: You practiced medicine as an apothecary.)


11: You worked as a servant.  The benefits to such a profession are many, since those wealthy enough to afford the privilege of a servant are wealthy enough to have comfortable living accommodations.  Some masters are cruel, some are kind, but you were in his service voluntarily and were free to take your leave when you desired.

12: You never amounted to much of anything.  You were a beggar, filthy and stinking in the streets, always quick to stretch out your hand to others.

___________________________________________________________

**Adventuring offers limitless wealth and glory, but it is a dangerous occupation.  Why would you leave your relatively (safe) and stable occupation to adventure?**

2-3: You were unsuited for your current occupation.  Your skills were better put to use elsewhere.  Why were you bad at it?  What in particular made adventuring a better fit for you?

4-5: You need the money.  Who do you owe a debt to?  What will happen if you don’t repay him?

6-8: Personal gain.  What do you plan to do once you have power, prestige, and riches?  Why weren’t you satisfied with your lot in life? 
 
9-10: Vengenace.  Someone wronged you a long time ago, and you want revenge.  Who?  Why can’t you forgive him?  What does your revenge entail?

11-12: Altruism.  You plan to use what you gain from adventuring to do good in the world.  What made you choose this over personal gain?  How do you plan on using your money?

_________________________________________________

**To determine how the people in your life have died, roll 3d6.**

3: War.  Slaughtered in the petty disputes of nobles.

4: Pestilence.  Disease came upon the land.

5: Famine.  Starvation as crops failed.

6: Execution.  Justice meted for crimes.

7-8: Murder.  Killed by bandits or thugs.

9: Infection.  A minor wound festered.

10-12: Happenstance.  A confluence of unfortunate events.

13-15: Nature.  The conspiring of the gods.

16-17: Beasts.  Slain by a wild animal.

18: Age.  A blessed death.",,False,,t5_2qh2s,1367612729.0,,,True,t3_1dn128,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1dn128/you_are_a_peasant_roll_2d6/,

But somehow, my mind can't parse the fact that pigs give Diplomacy bonuses. The rulebook justifies this by saying that pigs are sociable creatures, which I guess is right, but in my mind, the following thing takes place:  
Guard: ""Halt! Why do you need to enter?""  
Wizard: ""We need to enter, because of &lt;reasons&gt;."" (Rolls a Diplomacy check, fails.)  
Guard: ""I don't trust you.""  
(Wizard realises he hasn't calculated his pig bonus)  
Wizard: ""But I have this pig, see?""  
Guard: ""Oh yes, that changes everything, that is indeed a mighty fine pig. Go ahead, sir.""

I encourage roleplay. I offer multiple solutions to problems. I give incentives for non-violent resolution. Hell, I've killed more characters than G.R.R. Martin.

I feel bad if I try to discourage it too much because they really enjoy combat, but there's so much interesting potential in a situation that goes down the gutter once the weapons come out. They're all experienced players, so it's not a problem of hesitancy to roleplay. And god damn do they love roleplaying when it involves convincing people to give them new ways to murder people. I just don't know what to do with these guys to get them to slow down on the violence a little. Is it not my place to tell them how to have fun? We're all friends and I have no problem saying ""dudes, stop killing shit for two seconds,"" but if that's what they want to do, who am I to tell them otherwise? On the other hand, though, I really want some cool stuff to emerge from the story we're telling beyond ""remember that time I hit that guy so hard that his lungs came out his asshole? That was *awesome*."" What can I do?

e: To be clear: I enjoy DMing for them and will continue to do so regardless. I just want to offer them a change of pace without beating them over the head with pacifism. 


e2: God dammit we're not going to play Harry Potter Fiasco. I don't want to see Hermoine eviscerated any more than you do. It's never the system, it's always the players. Switching from D&amp;D will not help.

e3: A short summary of what I've felt is the best advice so far:

* The bigger a character's backstory, the less expendable he becomes. Any time a character's history might be relevant, encourage the player to make something up.
* Give them something to build or protect. Murdering is good; murdering to protect your city is great.
* Instead of killing them, play the long game - give them a curse, deformity, or something else they have to work around in creative ways.
* Create goals that allow for violence, but are way more awesome without it. It needs to be clear from the word ""go"" that the nonviolent option is more compelling. This has been part of my problem, I think - even if I have better rewards for creative problem-solving, if I don't communicate that then the players will never have a reason to try it.

e4: After replying to a billion comments, I think this is the clearest and most succinct way to ask my question: **How do you make non-combat as interesting as combat for people who love combat?**

e5: I feel like I've said this a hundred times, but just to reiterate: I'm not trying to punish them or force them to play my way so much as figure out how I can make non-combat an appealing choice for this type of player. Although I do love a lot of the punishment ideas being posted, if only for a laugh, so you can keep those coming too if you like.",,False,,t5_2qh2s,1359497319.0,,,True,t3_17i6mo,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/17i6mo/holy_shit_how_do_i_stop_my_players_from_murdering/,

This particular issue though I begged my dad for because it contained a Gold Dragon Sculpture you could make out of cardboard! I thought this was the coolest thing ever. I got it, took it home, and started it, but unfortunately my 10-year-old hands were not yet coordinated enough and it ended up a mess of scrap paper on the floor.

Fast forward to a few days ago when wcole01 submits [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/18wy4a/all_printed_issues_of_dragon_magazine_legally/), which suddenly opens up every issue of *Dragon* for everyone. I immediately go on a search that I suspect might be pointless but must be attempted nonetheless.

Long story short (sorry, too late I guess), some research, a PDF, thick paper, and a color printer later I'm able to take another crack at a failure that has haunted me for 25 years.

1374166553.0,418,self.rpg,1ikhyk,Slut shaming at the table [somewhat of a rant],astralrayn,650,232,318,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1ikhyk/slut_shaming_at_the_table_somewhat_of_a_rant/,"When I started playing D&amp;D (pathfinder and 4e) this isn't something that would have ever occurred to me. I've read posts about how others feel about dealing with sex in a campaign and I'm of the opinion that so long as a) it's not such a constant occurrence it de-rails everything and b) it's not being vividly and uncomfortably described at length it's all good. Sex happens sometimes, it's especially interesting (to me anyway) if it's a part of the character's development. 

My lawful good celestial half elf never got *that* sort of attention from the elves she lived with. Nobody wanted someone of 'lesser blood'. When she left her home humans viewed her similarly, and even the elves in her own party (though they are disguised Drow, she's not aware of that.) keep her at a distance and are far from friendly. So when an elven ranger helped the party and greeted her with kindness she flirted a little. (I crit the roll..I don't even know how) he flirted back and they hit it off. They wound up sharing a tent that night, I didn't even mention if they *did anything* or not.

What does the table say? ""Oh my god slut!"" and ""You JUST met this guy!"" (all out of character) One player later went on to tell me that ""Judging by your character's actions my character assumes she is a whore."" **Wow.** 

I brushed it off, it made sense for her character to reach out for someone of the race she identifies with who actually flirted *back* with her instead of ignoring her and calling her names. 

Many many sessions (almost a calendar year) later the group is transported to the underdark all disguised as drow. (Even the drow disguised as elves are now ironically disguised as drow) The drow culture has a large presence in her back story, I won't go into the whole thing.

Up until this point she'd been trying to stop her party from killing the drow they were facing so she might have the chance to speak to one. Unfortunately nobody listened to her. So now she wanted to see one up close and personal in a safe, private, non-combative situation away from the party. The party decided to hit the 'nightlife' part of town and they wound up at a club/brothel type establishment. My character, trying to fit into the shoes of her disguise, hires two males and takes them to a private room. 

Again with the ""slut/whore"" thing, which was a minor but disappointing thing. The rest was typical table banter that I expected and made us all giggle. (Vlad the impaler reference) The original way I phrased it made it sound really malicious. I realize I probably need to *grow thicker skin* but I've got a limit. 

All the while that scene happens our rogue literally agrees to pimp out our goblin for gold. But somehow I am the whore? 

I wound up writing up a small (very pg-13 no-mention-of-nudity-or-sex short) expanded scene to elaborate on what was going through my character's head and why she did what she did (i.e. why she wanted to see the drow up close), it also touched on her back story, tied almost all of her previous actions together in a way that made sense (even a seemingly meaningless conversation with one of the disguised elves in her party), grew her character, and hinted at events that might come to pass. I sent it to the group, two of them were kind enough to read it. 

I don't get why two instances of *implied* sex occurring almost a year apart are worthy of slut-shaming comments, especially when all the while our goblin is scampering around in the midst of an orgy and our rogue is getting paid for it. 

In contrast, I roleplay a changeling who often takes on the form of a male and whenever he flirts/sleeps with a woman the worst I get is ""ok, loverboy, we're leaving!"" 

Just as it would be in real life, a woman having sex does not automatically equate to ""slut"". A female character (regardless of the player's gender) shouldn't be deemed a 'slut' or a 'whore' because of their intimate choices, especially if they make sense for that character. Just as being completely celibate might make sense for a character, the point is to be in character. I don't like feeling like a shitty person who has to justify my character's actions because I said exactly what she would do. 

Edit: I do feel the need to note that yes, they probably are just busting my balls (ovaries..whatever.) Joshing around at the table is fun and keeps things even more entertaining out of character, but there are so many **better** ways to bust balls than going straight for the ""slut"" and ""whore"" remarks. 

**Edit #2: Ho-ly-crap guys. I didn't expect this to turn into such a hot topic but I'm really glad it is.** I'm sorry I can't respond to all your wonderful comments! It seems some of you have had similar experiences (even guys playing as girls!) and some of you have had different amazing experiences and I've enjoyed reading about all of them!! In fact, keep sharing them. I get a kick out of reading all of your in-game shenanigans. I didn't mean for this to turn into a table-bash-fest. (Of course in retrospect I totally set myself up, huh? There goes my mouth getting me in trouble again!) But luckily not everyone took it that way and many offered up some quality advice and I'm very grateful! Again, I'm not really bothered that my friends are teasing me, it's kind of expected at the table! I can't count how many failed rolls and horrible RP flops I've performed that warrented laughter and jests from the entire table (and often laughter at myself for how ridiculous it was!). But throwing terms like ""slut"" and ""whore"" around just aren't necessary. As /u/Sarge-Pepper 's highly-upvoted comment read:
&gt;It sucked that a character i has worked hard on and crafted from the groud with with an extensive background was reduced to simple naysaying and namecalling.

**Edit #3:** re-worded a few small things that just came off too harshly and it wasn't intended. I originally painted some of the comments as malicious when really it was all mixed in with typical banter. That's my fault. I didn't mean to make it sound like a bunch of assholes screaming nastiness at me, that's not how friends act!

I’ll answer any questions that don’t give away stuff that is still unsettled, like future product plans, release schedules, or specifics on the future of our digital tools for D&amp;D.

I’ll start answering questions around noon PDT on Friday, June 15th.

**5:38 PM PDT UPDATE:** Holy crap there are a lot of questions here. This was pretty awesome. I'm heading home in a few minutes, but first I need to push my brains back through my ears and into my skull. This was pretty cool, and I 100% want to do this again.

Also, stuff I learned today:

* I am totally off my soda habit. I gave up soft drinks two years ago and kind of started drinking them again this week. I had one to give me a caffeine jolt at the start, but I couldn't finish it.
* Bears just want to be spellcasters.
* People really, really want the fighter to have more toys.
* 4e fans aren't feeling the love yet. We'll have that covered - just give us some time.
* We've got a lot of work to do, but thanks to everyone's feedback and questions I think we can handle this.

Thanks, everyone! I'll pick at a few questions if I have time before I head out today, and I would love to do this again as the playtest progresses.

**9:32 AM, Saturday, June 16th:** I have a few free minutes (alas, even game designers have to do laundry) so I'm going to tackle a few questions while my washer and dryer do their thing.

They can hop back into the order whenever they are ready.
I think it realistically depicts the character freezing up in combat and failing to act.

However, as I've learned in life, you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.  So I am experimenting with giving players a +1 to their attack/skill check/spell roll (d20 system) when they act quickly, within 10 seconds.  In game terms, this basically means the player acted decisively and the swiftness of their attack makes it harder to defend.

In his pockets, he had $1000 and a couple hundred pounds sterling in large bills, the keys to a forest ranger vehicle, and a pack of gum minus two sticks.

That turned into enough of a hit that we got together with a group of friends to create Dead Gentlemen Productions. Now we're Dead Gentlemen and Zombie Orpheus and, in addition to Dorkness Rising, Demon Hunters, and JourneyQuest, we are currently producing our newest feature film, [The Gamers: Hands of Fate](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zombieorpheus/the-gamers-hands-of-fate/).

After a crappy experience with Hollywood distribution on Dorkness Rising—seriously, ask us about it—we decided that traditional distribution was broken. Now we release all of our films for free online under a Creative Commons license. Despite encouraging piracy, sharing, remixing, and other terrifying uses, our most recent release, the second season of [JourneyQuest](http://www.journey-quest.com), was entirely fan funded, thanks to a $113,000 Kickstarter and numerous direct contributions.

We believe that the internet is the perfect tool for making perfect, infinite copies of our work and we've embraced that, stating that we're no longer in the business of selling units, but of creating and nurturing a sustainable fan base. In addition to our work as filmmakers, we've also been working as an anti-distributor to support other indie filmmakers, including the people behind Aidan 5, GOLD: The Series, Chop Socky Boom, The Brothers Barbarian, Transolar Galactica, Standard Action, and many more. It turns out that the more we give away, the more we all benefit!

We're currently preparing the final three episodes of JourneyQuest's second season for online release, completing a Kickstarter campaign for Hands of Fate, and loading into booth 6033 at PAX Prime tonight to exhibit, screen, and sign all weekend. We're trying something new at our booth as well: offering all of our DVDs as Pay What You Can, $0 and Up.

tl;dr We make funny movies about gamers.

Ask us anything!

Yes we're doing the how we would cope in a zombie apocalypse. First session went amazingly well, except for one of us getting shot in the leg. Second session we coped with that pretty well and things just kept getting better. 

Up until about half way that is. Our group of five has four zombies in front of us in an alley. With zombies I've often thought if it's a small number just take them out and things will be easier down the road, plus I'm riding the high of us doing so well. So I attack. The rest decide to debate this action and our GM is not letting us pass off these discussions as non-game time. So I get mobbed and bitten. I openly say it's my fault for charging in without checking with the others. I keep my bites secret. 

Infection is a three checkboxes affair, 1 is the bite then CON checks every day to see how you're coping). I make it through session 2 without any more incidents. Over the next week I decide to brave on, being a buffer for the rest of the group. First in the door and what have you. So session 3 starts and I start being the man at the front. Once again things go really well for us, couple of incidents where it could have gone badly but we manage to get through by the skin of our teeth. But an hour in I get a note from the GM that I'm feeling worse. Since we're heading for what we think will be a safe house I figure I'll hold on till we get there for lugging stuff and making sure the others survive. 

We actually do make the safe house okay, although it's not quite safe. the people we were meeting are dead or undead. We clear the house, get the bodies outside. I volunteer to move them further away so they don't stink the place out. I then inform everyone they hear a gunshot. Everyone is confused, including the GM. They head outside and find my body. The GM describes my bites, and I explain my thinking and that I'm happy to sit out until they finish this game, I was infected and I made the choice. Everyone is in shock I'd offed myself.

I've posted this link more than a few times in this and /r/pathfinder_rpg's comments, but I wanted to post a full thread to share for all to see and use.  
[The Ultimate RPG Playlist](http://retro.grooveshark.com/#!/user/Ultimate+RPG/15515727/music/playlists), a series of playlists in Grooveshark to which strive to suit the needs of most general genres and moods. PLEASE be sure to sort these playlists alphabetically, *and* randomize playback for best results!  
I've been working alone on this project off-and-on for a couple years now, but even still it's definitely a work in progress. Some playlists are less filled out than others, and some songs still stick out as being inappropriately placed now and then. To that end, **if you have any suggestions for changes or additions**, for individual songs or entire playlists, just comment below!  
I'm also very open to the idea of someone **joining my 'team' and helping out**, as I don't have as much time to sort music as I used to. If this idea interests you, just get in touch. :)  
Keep in mind, though sometimes songs come along that don't quite fit the mood you're going for, consider if they still fit the general approach of the playlist before suggesting they get removed. Sometimes a song is a mistake, sometimes it just fits one moment but not another. :)

**Playlist Guide:**  
|  
I use these generic sort of terms because they work across multiple genres:  
* 'Combat!' - For action and fight scenes.  
* Darkness - Creepy/horror/Dungeon Crawling/Danger  
* Explore/Calm - For all other generally calm or happily adventurous times.  
|  
* Classical - These are intended for a fancy royal palace or Renaissance-period, but need some work.  
* Club - For your modern, scifi, or WoD club scene. Or just for your listening pleasure - it's fairly geek-inspired.  
* Desert - Self explanatory  
* Far east - Oriental inspired, for eastern campaigns and locations  
* General - Most of these lean towards Fantasy, but could also be used as generic moods. These are the most filled out and the core three (combat, darkness, explore) have hundreds of songs each. Also included here is a *Boss Battle*, *Escape!*(Very cross-genre), *Evil Lair* (For that big, evil reveal or 'we're so screwed' feeling), *Festival* (Pretty fantasy-inspired), *Tavern/Pub* (also fantasy), *Temple*, and *Town*(Mostly fantasy).  
* Holiday - These both started out as geek-inspired, and are filled out a bit with your more typical stuff.  
* Misc - Assorted specific playlists that didn't fit anywhere else. Some of these need a lot more work.  
* Mood - Specific moods which can typically work cross-genre. Some of these are pretty lean still.  
* Ocean - These are intended for ocean/pirate campaigns, but it's amazingly hard to find music to fill them (see my details on sorting methods below).  
* Oldies - 20's/30's noire and big band fun. The 'Radio' playlist has music with lyrics, while the other two do not (mostly).  
* Retro - 8bit funs! Some of it pushes the bits a bit, but it's still the same general feel.  
* Scifi - self explanatory  
* Vampire - For your dark and gritty WoD etc games. There is only 'calm' and 'combat' because the calm has plenty of creepy badassitude on its own.  
* Western - self explanatory  
* zzz_SORTING - a huge pile of music I haven't sorted yet. Not an actual playlist at all.  
|  
|  
|  
**My Sorting Methods**  
I have a lot of various criteria that I adhere to before sorting a song into this or that playlist. If you're curious, here are the details:  
|  
* Except in special circumstances, each song must be NON-CONTEXTUAL. Contextual music is what you usually hear in most movies outside the main title theme - it is composed to fit the exact specific moments happening on screen (the context) and thus often times the mood/speed/flow of the song changes dramatically and frequently. Unfortunately, this renders-most- music from feature films unusable. Exceptions to this rule are usually title themes, action sequences, or long drawn-out scenes where they cut up the music properly. Exceptions to the rule in my playlists are when a full 2.5 minutes of music is PERFECT, but then there's like 10 seconds of loud buildup or something...I usually forgive these bits and include it anyway.  
* Along those same lines, each song must be CONSISTENT in its style/speed/mood. Nothing drives me more nuts when working on this project than having a song that's AMAZING for one playlist for 30 seconds, and then completely changes into something different. This comes up a LOT when I'm trying to find music to fill the 'Ocean' playlists.  
* I also tend to AVOID LYRICS or words of any kind, as they can end up being very distracting when you're trying to play. Even in awesome action scenes when rock or metal music would be appropriate, if people are too busy enjoying the music and singing along to pay attention, that's a problem. A few exceptions have been made over time when I felt that the words blended in with the music well enough to not stand out and be distracting.  
* For anything outside the 'retro' playlists, I tried to avoid a lot of 8-bit/synthy sounding music. Sometimes this can seem a bit cruel, especially when you're nostalgic about certain old games, but for those of us without that nostalgia, music like this can sound very harsh, distracting, and unpleasant.  
* I generally also try to avoid songs that are so incredibly well known as to prove distracting, mostly major movie themes like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, etc (Sorry John). Themes like this tend to take you out of your game and back to the movie they were made for, as we have such strong associative memories with them.  
* I have no qualms about a song being in multiple playlists - I hope to eventually have each and every list be able to sustain itself without having to combine with other sources.  
* Random fun fact, anything composed by 'The Lizard of Odd' was by yours truly.  
|  
Here's hoping you enjoy these playlists and get as much use out of them as I do. Cheers!

A lot. However, I have my stories. Idiotic things where not only you, but the group looks at the player (or players) and just went, ""Really man...?""

Example from my past:

- (3.5) An extremely long campaign was finishing up. The PCs finally rescued the ""princess"" they so desperately were paid to save, but had to sneak back out. As they had successfully posed as guards to get in to their location, they now had to get out. Two PCs convinced that fair maiden to get into a Bag of Holding, so they could make their escape. The unconscious (and healing) Cleric had something to say, but he didn't want to metagame, so he let it take its course.

Their reasoning was that they would sneak right back out as no alarm had been raised. (The session was going great. Folks played their roles well and they had the Rogue to assassinate everyone they came across.) They took their time, but made the decision. So, they traveled out. All the way back to the poor girl's father, where they promptly pulled out the Bag of Holding. W/ tears in dad's eyes of overbearing joy the PCs reached in the bag.

To find a dead woman. The player playing the Rogue looks at me and simply says, ""Fuck..."" At this point the Cleric's player looks at him and says, ""Yeah... I couldn't say anything. How long did you expect her to be able to hold her breath...?""

The PCs didn't think it through and had suffocated the poor girl. Then they presented her corpse to her father. In rage he recanted the bounty offer and banned them from the city.

It was for a ""Write a Free RPG in 24 hours contest"".

_____

Here are the games in no particular order, with a small blurb about each one.  Fair warning, this is fairly incoherent.

* **Fate Game** - Fun idea.  Gods describe the lives of people living in a small village and attempt to twist events to gain more influence for their ""domain"" of power.  Considering it's a competitive game, I'm not sure the rules are structured enough, as it basically amounts to each player telling a short story, and then the GM handing out points.

* **Torus One** - Players take the role of fairly unimportant workers on a space station.  Really lends itself to the players attempting to accomplish simple tasks, and failing in hilarious ways.  This one seems like a lot of fun to play. 

* **SSN-589 USS Scorpion Down** - A really interesting semi-cooperative game where players attempt to keep a submarine afloat while each attempting to accomplish their own, secret, goal.  Very interesting resolution mechanic that I think would lend itself to depth of strategy.  I'm really looking forward to trying this one out.

* **I Will Be Hamlet!** - Players take the roles of actors competing to play Hamlet in an upcoming play.  It's a weird mix of ideas and mechanics, which is not helped by it being fairly obvious that English is not the author's first language.  I honestly didn't get a very good feel for this game, and would have to read it far more carefully than I did to get one.

* **Claustrophobia!** - A bunch of mostly insane dwarf adventurers attempt to ride a home built nuclear powered 'submarine' through the earth to reach the core, while slowly (or not so slowly) going *completely* insane.  This game seems like a hilariously fun time, and really encourages off the wall and ridiculous scenarios cropping up constantly.  I will most certainly be hounding my gaming group to play this one some time.  (*Currently my favorite of the one's I've read.*)

* **Dr Keeton’s Machine** - Go into a steampunk computer and fight steampunk robots.  Very simple game, very simple resolution mechanic, very simple setting, and practically no real story to speak of. It's not bad, as much as fairly dull and uninteresting.

* **GOBLIN CAVE** - Play as goblins attempting to gather enough supporters to become the new goblin Warlord.  Your character is a die, all the NPCs are dice, and you get stronger by standing on other dice, or putting some dice on your head.  I swear this makes sense once you read it (although it is not very well laid out).  It's a fairly interesting and fun looking game, with some interesting mechanics based on what *kind* of die you are, what color it is, and what number is currently on it.  This seems like it could  be a fun competitive game.

* **How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb Shelter** - Players take the roles of either assassin's attempting to kill a VIP or Defenders, attempting to defend him, while trapped inside a bomb shelter.  Everyone's roles (beside the GM controlled VIP) are hidden, which could lead to either an incredibly intense game of cat and mouse, or an incredibly wacky and hilarious game a la The Ship.  This is probably the best produced and presented game on here so far.

* **Ringworld Zombie** - Play as a group of prisoners trying to escape from a teeny tiny zombie-ridden Ringworld.  There's no GM, so enemies, resolution, and really everything is done through a deck of cards.  It seems like an interesting idea but looks like it's almost entirely random, with very little player input.  Can't say for sure until I've play it though.

* **SMAF 17** - Fight for survival in an under water post WW3 Rapture-esque prison.  This game has really cool and well thought out dice mechanics.  Not only is there a difficulty for each action, there's a risk as well, which increases the chances of it going spectacularly well, or catastrophically wrong.  There's even a solid sanity system, as well as a fleshed out setting.  Probably the most complete of the RPGs I've read so far, one of the very few you could actually run a campaign in.

* **Space Travels** - Play as what is essentially the opposite of a Vulcan (extreme emotions, rather than none) in what is essentially the Star Trek universe.  The dice mechanics are almost certainly going to lead to an extraordinary amount of frustration if anyone attempts to play the game with even a modicum idea of accomplishing things.  The randomness is (apparently) intended, but I'm unconvinced it would make a good game.  It could be fun if you embrace the game for what it is, and play into that.

* **Tale of Narvi** - So I'm not 100% sure I fully grasped this game, but from what I can tell it's a single player GM less RPG.  It's basically a very complicated and well made ""choose your own adventure"" but with dice rolls.  Honestly, it seems really cool and is definitely something I plan on running through sometime.  There's also a lot of (mostly superfluous) setting information, so I can easily see more mini adventures like this being made.

* **The Silent Void** - A forum game where players take the role of stranded astronauts attempting to get back to a space station.  There's honestly very little content to this game, and given how quickly you'd have to spend resources in order to reasonably succeed in actions, it'd also be very short.  Could still be fun given the right players and GM.

* **Viento Libre** - A semi collaborative high fantasy game, where players take the roles of representatives from four (conflicting) races attempting to solve a mystery of epic proportions.  What makes this game interesting is that within the larger plot, each player gets assigned a secret smaller objective.  These missions (which continuously get assigned as they are completed) are sometimes aligned between players, but will most likely lead to an interesting intrigue and conflict between players.

* **Wings Keeton and the Airship of Doom** - A very pulpy system with a World War I setting (and perhaps a bit of steampunk).  The rules are very simple and straightforward, and very evocative in description.  The way it's set up seems like it would keep the game, and combat, moving at a very quick pace.  The rulebook even comes with a solo adventure you can play through yourself in a form of hyperlinked choose your own adventure (with some added dice rolls).

* **Yes, but** - A GM-less game where you succeed in everything you attempt to do, but... there are always hilarious and terrible consequences.  Abilities are replaced with *in*abilities which actively hinder anything you attempt.  This game seems like an amazingly hilarious time to play, complete with earning ""Thingies"" which have absolutely no purpose.  The only part I'm not sold on is the weird meta-gaming aspects of the races, but they could turn out to be fun.  If not they are easily discarded.

*The starred ones are games that would work for a full campaign, or at least past a one shot.

I want to emphasize that this ordering is very rough, and should not be relied on too much (I'd be more than willing to play any but the bottom few).  I'd highly suggest reading the actual rulebook for anything that looks even mildly interesting to you (they're all pretty short).

If anyone has any specific question, go ahead and ask but it's probably easier to just go read the rulebook.

It allows me to more accurately gauge their alignment and can create good stories and tension in a session.

One way I like doing this is with incapacitated opponents. A lot of systems have a state where an opponent is down and bleeding to death, but not dead. This tends to be described as being unconscious, but I'd like to give you a situation looked at two different ways.

**The usual, amoral way:**

""You deal enough damage to drop the orc. He is alive but incapacitated, bleeding out unconscious on the ground.""

""I finish him.""

Most players are used to having binary good and bad guys. You down a monstrous humanoid, you finish them, no problem.

but...

**The ""am I a bad person?"" way:**

""Your crit decapitates the last standing orc. All opponents are down and out, but you hear gurgling coming from one of them.""

""I finish him.""

""As you approach you see his eyes are open and he is aware. His injuries are extreme, he cannot move and he is bleeding from a wound in his neck profusely. As you approach he reaches out to you and opens his fist, there is something there.""

""I wait and check what is in his hand.""

""He very gently hands you a soiled cloth wrapped around something. Curled in the cloth are some teeth. They appear orcish, but very small and much cleaner than you'd expect. Possibly the teeth of an orcish child. The orc gurgles a sound, it sounds much like the word 'son' but his common is heavily accented. What do you do?""

Now the orc is a father, one who is thinking of his son in his last moments. One handing you his most prized possession. He is ""humanized"".

Why? Does he want mercy? A quick death? His body returned to his son?

If the player now chooses to finish him, is it a cut and dry good act?

Maybe you just lead to a side quest to return the body to hostile territory, or even heal the orc and eventually he becomes a cohort of the party.

Now you can see just how LG your Paladin is.",,False,,t5_2qh2s,False,,lfg,True,t3_1bnqtf,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1bnqtf/challenging_player_morality_incapacitated_doesnt/,

While on the trail and resting for the night, a bounty hunter attempts to sneak around and tie up the PC’s one by one. As soon as someone wakes up and spots him, or he ties everyone up, the full moon comes out, and the bounty hunter begins to panic, and change.
2.	A lower level (5-10) party, in a forest setting, encounters a Gray Render ( http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/gray-render), who, despite being horrific in appearance with several piercing yellow eyes, possesses a friendly, childlike curiosity, speaks common, and has no memories outside of the forest. If treated with kindness, he will follow the party and assist in battle, as long as the battle doesn’t conflict with his alignment. He only runs if attacked by the party though, and begs the party to just let him go as he flees. 
3.	A local cult is stealing food from everyone nearby, driving the local stores out of business, while demanding the food be given as an offering to their ‘Gluttonous God.’ Upon fighting (or talking) their way in to the cult, the party realizes the “Gluttonous God” is actually just a sphere of annihilation a pit, and the cult is simply throwing food into it, thinking they need to appease it to keep it from moving around.
4.	In the middle of nowhere an argument is heard. A troll wizard with twelve ioun stones is accusing a longtime rival orc wizard with six ioun stones of stealing one of his ioun stones and demanding it’s return. The orc maintains that the six he has belong to him and he’s only had those six for the last few months. The orc is telling the truth, of course, but the troll is convinced he’s a thief.
5.	Two days ago, a blue dragon landed in the castle courtyard and refuses to leave, all the while being very polite in his assertions to stay. According to him, the desert was simply too dry and boring, and he much prefers conversing with human nobles and royalty instead of his own kind, though anyone who knows anything about dragons knows this is likely not the case. The locals want him gone, though he has committed no crime, except trespassing, and openly declares that he detests violence and simply refuses to fight. If attacked, he just fly’s away, and returns a few days later, wounds healed, and a bit annoyed. “Why should you care where I make my home? You think anyone would siege a city with a dragon living inside? You should be thanking me!” (As the DM, figure out what his real, assuredly evil plan actually is.)
6.	A local tavern has a horned devil (http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/horned ) as a bouncer. He hates his job. The tavern keep made a deal with the devil, for his soul of course, but managed to outsmart the devil when it came to the actual contract. “He should have read the fine print!” the Halfling tavern keeper often boasts. “Now I’m stuck here doing whatever he says until he dies a natural death, and if he dies an unnatural death I’m contractually bound to resurrect him! I am a laughing stock!”
7.	A young girl, whenever she casts any “summon natures ally” or “summon monster” the spell creates creatures that don’t have a time limit, they hang around forever. She’s becoming overwhelmed with the responsibility of all her pets, and the town is getting upset, having seen one too many giant celestial spiders crawling around the rooftops for no particular reason. 
8.	A Kobold is trying to buy a +5 ring of protection from a local shop keeper in a human, surface town. The shop keeper, despite being terrified, still refuses to sell, even when twice the market price is offered. The locals are about 5 minutes away from grabbing pitchforks and torches, to drive the Kobold out, and any PC with Spellcraft or good Perception can tell this Kobold is a very powerful caster. 
9.	While walking on the road, a caravan approaches from the opposite direction. The guards are well armed, mostly Humans, a few Dwarves, and an Ogre with a massive meteor hammer. As the caravan passes, it’s plainly evident that these people are slavers, transporting slaves in a string of carts, with a stock of at least 40. As they pass, the guards keep a watchful eye on the PC’s, and the slaves, without speaking, reach out through the bars at the passing party, silently and desperately pleading for help. 
10.	While seated at a tavern, a Rogue introduces himself. He starts by telling the story of the first man he had to kill, a sorcerer-assassin who used spell-storing daggers, with a scorching ray in each. The rogue managed to avoid the sorcerer’s spells, and when he drew his magic-imbued daggers, the rogue grabbed them, and thrust them into the sorcerer, killing him in a fiery explosion. “I still use his daggers, even now, I use a wand to recharge them. In addition to his daggers, I also took one of his habits. This sorcerer assassin, you see, always introduced himself to his target before hunting them down. So, with that out of the way, I declare that the hunt is on, and I’m giving you a three day head start.” With that, the rogue begins to laugh, and the ‘major image’ of the rogue vanishes into nothing.

So they get to a larger city and are given a contact.  This contact agrees to trade information for a job.  The job is simple:  Kill a guy who ritually scarred one of her working girls.

The party heads to the inn/bar where this guy is known to hang out, and identifies him.  The Sorcerer, a native of this area ingratiates himself to this nutball and gets an invite to meet the target at the slave auction the next day.  The party also has the Sorcerer and the Ranger/Scout tail this guy back to his residence at a mansion in a gated community.  

They then start planning and all things go to hell.  

I expected them to try and put the hit on this guy after a night of drinking.  Nope.  

They elect to hand the hat of disguise to the Rogue and have him be the Sorcerer's ""plaything"".  The Sorcerer meets the target at the auction and offers him some ""fun time"" with said ""plaything"".  He convinces the target to ditch most of his retinue and off they go.  

The target arrives.  He walks in the private room.  The Ranger/Scout rolls out of the bed and drills this guy with his crossbow, The Sorc casts ghost sound to cover the violence, and the Goliath Crusader then moves from the adjacent room and pulps him, with a Goliath Warhammer.  There is now blood everywhere.  They stuff bedding into the body to stop the blood and then realize they have no way to dispose the body.  The Goliath begs a huge chamberpot from the inn and is given a kettle for his use, they are told they will have to cover the cost of a replacement kettle.

They search the headless corpse, stuff the body in the kettle and then the Goliath takes a massive dump on the body, supposedly to cover the smell of blood.  They clean up the mess, and then, after some planning decide to look for a sewer drain to dump the body down.  They find one in the alley and dispose of the whole mess with no one being the wiser (thanks to some Charm Person spells from the Sorc).

**TL;DR  Party kills a target in a strange manner, hides the body in a kettle and then takes a dump on it and hurls it down a sewer.**

A micro event is just a teeny tiny little interaction with an NPC, whose soul purpose is to provide a little opportunity for some roleplaying. I use them in cases where some characters are leveling up and others are kind of bored, or similar situations. The micro events are in no way important to the campaign (not that the PCs know that!).  
  
Here are some examples:  ""A gnarled old man offers to sell you a 'lucky' trinket for 1 gold coin,"" ""A young boy wants to see a demonstration of your weapon,"" ""A little girl is crying because she broke her favorite toy,"" ""A little gem falls out of the pocket of the man walking ahead of you,"" ""A guard stops you and asks you a few questions because you sort of match the description of a wanted criminal,"" ""A simpleton relaxing in the shade challenges you to a milk-drinking contest,"" ""A handful of giggling teenagers badger you for some adventuring stories,"" ""A middle-aged noble accuses you of cheating with their spouse,"" etc etc.  
  
The idea is that these scenarios are only slightly more interesting than small talk about the weather, but nothing that can't be brushed off with a simple, ""Sorry, not now, I'm busy,"" if the character chooses not to interact at all. Some great times to use these micro events would be early in the game (to learn more about the personality of the characters), at slow moments (to give bored players something to do while other players are otherwise occupied), or as red herrings (if your players are figuring things out too quickly, toss one of these at them -- they might think it's significant and be thrown off the trail for a while!)

No, hypothetical Redditor, just quit flappin' your yap for a minute and check this out. Railroading can be quite useful. Jesus, hypothetical Redditor, I can hear your teeth gnashing from across the internet. Shut the fuck up and follow me for a sec.  
  
Railroading ensures your players experience something, no matter what. At its basest level, that's all it is. Players reach this point, they experience this event. Maybe it's a crucial item to the plot. Maybe its a critical clue. Maybe John's character is struck by lightning because John showed up late to the game for the third time in a row. Fucking John, man.  
  
Admit it, many of you have wanted DESPERATELY to railroad your players, whether to save the campaign, or because they're about to bypass something you as a GM worked really hard on. But you didn't, did you? You held fast to ""railroading is bad"" and you let things go to hell. But next time, don't worry. You can railroad. Just do it WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT. Let's look at an example, and you tell me whether or not the GM is guilty of railroading:  
  
Player: ""I hand over the reagent to the Blue Mage, and politely wait for him to pay me, as we agreed.""  
DM: ""He grins, and takes the reagent, and chugs it in a quick gulp. He begins to transform before your very eyes...""  
Player: ""No! He betrayed me! I rush in to kill him before the transformation completes.""  
DM: ""Roll initiative."" (DM rolls dice.)  
Player: ""Woohoo! Twenty-five!""  
DM: ""You are quick, but the transformation is quicker still. By the time you've drawn your sword and take a swing, there is a Demon Beast standing before you.""  
  
Well? Was that player railroaded into failing to stop the Blue Mage? Yes. Here's how: The DM gave the player the illusion of choice (the player could have given the reagent, kept it, or attempted to destroy it. The Wise DM had prepared for all these events.) The DM began railroading on a roll of the dice (this appears random because the DM rolled some dice. But the DM was going to win all along.)  
  
Here are some follow-ups: Don't ever press the issue. If a player is clever enough to get around your preparations and find a ""legal"" way off the railroad, let him. Pressing the issue suddenly makes it clear you are railroading. And the whole point is to maintain the illusion that there is chance involved. Also, know your players. Get to know their quirks, their style, etc, so you can effectively plan for contingencies against their particular brand of lunacy. As a result, you'll find it's easier to railroad later in the game than earlier, as you'll be more familiar with the players.  
  
In short, railroading isn't BAD as long as you do it in a way that doesn't look like railroading. You don't HAVE to let your games go to pot, you don't HAVE to let the players walk past that dungeon you were up all night working on. I'm not advocating that you should railroad everything, just that when you NEED to railroad, go ahead, but make sure to railroad SMART.  
  
Just some helpful hints, hypothetical Redditor. You may resume your hypothetical angry teeth gnashing now, I know it was hard for you to hold it in.",,False,,t5_2qh2s,False,,lfg,True,t3_174wtv,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/174wtv/how_to_railroad/,

With over 18,000 readers, meme posts are inevitable, but I'd just like to point out that they are not the preferred content on here. /r/rpg is a community for people to talk about RPGs and to get help and ideas. Yes, humour is good and welcome, but we don't want this sort of material to outnumber the real content here. 

Some people complain that there aren't enough posts here and that posting quick, easy to consume content increases the traffic here and gets more people involved. But I strongly believe that it's just the contrary. Meme posts get a lot of drive-by upvotes, and this means that they end up going quite high on the /r/rpg's main page, but they don't require people to engage in the thread. 

The more of this sort of inane content there is, the lower down legitimate content will be. Those looking for help won't get it as much because the subreddit will be flooded with images catering to the lowest common denominator. I never tire of stressing that /r/rpg prefers quality, not quantity.

At the moment, mods aren't removing these posts unless a) they're blatantly stupid or off-topic posts, or b) we're in a bad mood.

It saddens me when I see legitimate questions about games get more downvotes than upvotes, but meme posts of a guy responding to his girlfriend about Skyrim get over 400 points.

""As important as fighting is to the AD&amp;D game, it isn't the be-all and end-all of play. It's just one way for characters to deal with situations.

1348585390.0,310,self.rpg,10gagk,So I made my players shiver last night (Story),LordGrey,360,50,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/10gagk/so_i_made_my_players_shiver_last_night_story/,"This happened during our last 4e play session, and I was fairly proud of the reaction. Allow me to share:

Here is the set up, the party consists of 6 people, including one NPC, set up like a mercenary band. Earlier, they had killed a Bog Hag and had been met with the following curse ""For those that bear my blood, during the nights of the darkened moon, may my sisters find you."" A curse that says one thing and implies another. Not only would the rest of the hag coven know where the players are, but they have the ability to REACH them, making no where safe to hide.

Additionally and inconveniently, this curse happened two weeks before a period of time known as ""The fortnight of the darkened moon"", a two week period where the moon is consistently in ""New moon"" phase, making the curse extra dangerous in the near future.

During the time before the fortnight started, my players jaunted over to the shadowfel for a small stint to commune with a dead soul to learn a vital ritual. While there, the party's bard, a female half elf named Camiel, was possessed by a spirit and granted her the privilege to come back OUT of the shadowfel through her body. This had two effects: The first is that the spirit was no longer stuck in the shadowfel, a place where it didn't belong. The second is that now it was ""haunting"" Camiel. This spirit was a 10 year old girl.

During nights, the spirit would actually crawl into bed with Camiel and cuddle up to her, but always be gone the next morning. Beyond that, Camiel would only notice her presence if she looked into mirrors, occasionally the girl would be there, though she seemed to be harmless.

Then the fortnight started. The party found a safe place out of town to wait the long winter nights out, without people around to get caught up in it. The Hags started off slow, but not showing any real signs of screwing with the party. On the second night, their camp fire died out way faster than it ought to have. That's fine, no biggy.

On the third night, one of the party member's trail rations all rotted, and his water skin was full of blood. He borrowed from another member that day. The next day, he bought a bunch more rations and that night they all rotted again. Additionally, on the forth night a bunch of creatures were noticed in the shadows past the firelight, medium sized catlike things that growled and flashed glowing eyes at them. Then they heard something coming up beside they, looked, and nothing was there except a trail of footprints in the snow that abruptly stopped. Then the cats were gone.

They traveled back to town that morning, and slept, once again, during the day. Camiel had the normal event of having someone crawl into bed with her while half asleep, so she did the usual cuddle up and passed out.

Then she heard a slight banging. At first she just dismissed it at someone in the other room being noisy, it was mid-day after all. It god louder and louder, so she couldn't sleep anymore. She looked around her room and noticed a small mirror on her wall bouncing slightly with some force. 

She slid out of bed and peaked at the mirror from a distance, and saw the little girl who should be in bed with her, slamming her fists on the mirror and yelling something out noiselessly. 

By reading her lips, Camiel was able to make out these words.

""CAMIEL!""

""BE CAREFUL!""

""IT'S NOT ME!""

This is when everyone in my party got chills. Next thing that happened, there was a slam of an opening window, and turning around camiel saw an empty bed, the blankets being half drawn towards the window, as of something moving in quite a hurry.

Later, they had the girl draw what she saw, what was in bed with Camiel. The spirit breathed on the mirror, fogging it up, and drew a simple doodle with her finger of a skinny old woman, with long hair, and huge claws.

**The game is not about your story** (be it the PC's narrative or the DM's campaign).

 **The game is about the collaborative story** (the story generated by PCs and NPCs bouncing off each other).

And now, to beat a dead horse with some examples:

---

* **DMs:** No one cares about the pseudo-novel that you've spent months writing. As the man behind the curtain, the best way to foster a collaborative story is to **plan between sessions, one session at a time.**

---

* **PCs:** It's not about being a lone gun, Beowulf-caliber, marry-sue, living-legend, bad-ass-extraordinaire... especially not at level 1. **EVERYONE HAS FLAWS** (Yes, even you). Keep in mind: For some reason, your PC has chosen to roll with a bunch of other people. Come up with reasons why, and make them good. If you come up with crap like ""My flaw is that other people are intimidated by my accomplishments"" and "" I'm with the party because I have nothing better to do"" you're not doing it right. 

---

* **DMs:** Each PC cares WAY more about themselves then any of your NPCs. In most every case, **Your NPCs EXIST TO DIE...** either as antagonists to be vanquished or protagonists to be avenged. [*More accurately, NPCs exist to fail. The enemies are eventually bested, and the allies are ultimately unable or unwilling to resolve the given conflict without the PCs*]

[*Note that I used the term ""bested"" instead of ""defeated"" to include games like Cthulhu, where the best victory one can hope for is to mildly irritate one of the elder gods before succumbing to madness and death*]

---

* A ""DMPC"" is only warranted when filling a troublesome vacancy in the combat-role makeup of the party. **A DMPC should ALWAYS be LESS POWERFUL then any given PC.** 

[*I have come to realize that ""DMPC"" has a range of definitions. In this case, a DMPC is:*]

[*An NPC that has ""party member"" status, and/or is with the party frequently. They usually a place holder for when a campaign is about to change GMs. They have a backstory, but only because it's kind of weird to have a 2-dimensional character around all the time. A DMPC will usually fulfill ""the medic"" or ""the tank"" role, because none of the PCs are interested.*]

---

* **PCs: Don't be a dick.** Nobody cares if it's ""totally in character"" for your thief to steal from the other PCs, or kill everything in sight, or be a hyper-sexualized female caricature. If you have your fun at the expense of others, and **If you don't knock it off when asked nicely, you're PC deserves to to die, alone and screaming, in  blistering hellfire.**

---

* **DMs:** The game **Is not ""you vs. them.""** It's ""your antagonists vs. the PCs and your supporting protagonists."" By design, a majority of play time will be spent destroying the things you created. You should revel in their accomplishments, not resent them. 

---

* **PCs: If you have an idea for something *really* cool to incorporate into the game, you have an obligation to speak up.** It doesn't matter if it's a houserule, an item, spell, skill, character, location, plot event, bit of history... *anything.* The DM isn't obligated to use it, and you shouldn't rattle off everything that comes to mind, but any DM worth his salt will consume and assimilate good ideas. 

---

* **DMs: and PCs:** go into your brain and build a gigantic stone wall between in-game grievances, and out-of-game grievances. In-game bullshit is arbitrated by the DM. Out-of-game bullshit is handled by you and the person you have beef with, and usually not on game time. **Passive-aggressive bullshit is never warranted, and should never be tolerated** Don't be a dick to a PC because the person controlling him took your parking spot, and don't be a dick to a person because his character failed to save you from a pack of ravenous void-wolves.

---

* [*New point*] **Before you even start a campaign, It is important that everyone goes over what kind of game it's going to be.** Namely: The setting, tone, and any major house rules. Though not really related to egos getting in the way of collaboration, it is the root cause of a lot of the problems that get posted.

---

After getting this rant out of my system, I realize that all of this can be boiled down even further:

 **TAKE YOUR EGO OUT OF THE EQUATION.** 

The potential for RPGs to be truly amazing is that they blend of competition and *[cooperation].* This is also the fundamental cause of the typical problems that plague them. 

At any rate. Hope this helps... happy rolling.

Little background, the group I DM for are all very new, and I'm their first DM, so a lot of learning, and a lot of variety to see what everyone likes the most. They just leveled up for the first time, so lots of excitement about growth.

We just wrapped up a horror adventure that took place over a couple of sessions, so I wanted to lighten the tone up some as well as have an entirely non-combat adventure. 

While the heroes are cooling their heels at their base of operations (a tavern called The Wet Wench), they were approached by a terrified looking gnome merchant. He explains that he acquired, at great personal cost, an ancient artifact of wondrous power, hoping to sell it to wealthy collectors. However, he explained that ever since he acquired the item, he thinks he's being followed, strange occurrences are happening around him ('accidents' like falling statues, workhorses going wild suddenly and trying to buck him, etc.) He's in over his head, but he's sunk all his money (50k gp) into this, and he has no other money. 

The heroes, being the kind souls they are, agree to give him 5k gp and take the item from him, for who better to handle whatever this artifact is drawing that The Heroes Reborn? (name of the group).

The gnome merchant also gives them a sealed scroll, and explains that in the light of the full moon, the scroll will unseal itself, and if mortals of great power speak the words, untold powers will be revealed to them. You can almost smell the excitement from the group, they're rip raring for a no holds fight to try their new abilities and get power. 

A few nights pass, with minor oddities (shutters banging in their room like they're being forced open, but when a hero opens the window, there's nothing there, etc.), but nothing major materializes. Then, the night with the full moon arrives. The heroes go outside the city limits, and break the seal on the scroll. There are five words of power, so each character takes one, and they read it in order. 

Auma

Fuu

Lisch

Moor

Tall

They repeat it a few times, and it slowly dawns on them what they're saying (I'm a foolish mortal). Then, the artifact explodes with soverign glue and feathers. They were screwed magnificently. 

Just the reaction from my players was glorious. Watching their eyes widen as they heard what they were saying, to the uproarious 'THAT MOTHERFUCKER CHEATED US. THAT LITTLE BASTARD' that they shouted for a full ten minutes, was absolutely the best DM experience I've ever had in my life. 

From there, they began the manhunt for the little bastard (their new nickname for the gnome), which led them through rotten sewers, to abandoned lighthouses, all the while being led astray by red herrings, misinformation, and general annoyances, until they finally got some solid intel and staked out his favorite brothel. They caught him with his 'pants down' as it were, and bundled him up in sheets and got him to the guard, where they received their bounty. Feeling pretty satisfied, they retired for the evening, only to hear the news the next morning.

So we all had to try and tell it a good riddle(or joke with thought). 

Our Cleric had a pretty good one. (kind of long forgive me).

2 bards are in a pub and one looks to the other and says, ""I bet I can befriend a dragon before you"". The second bard says, ""You're on"". So the first bard runs home and starts planning out this amazing song to woo the dragon over.

The second bard hikes up the mountain and asks the dragon if she would like to be friends. The dragon agrees.

The next day the 2 bards meet up at the pub and the first bard says, ""You ready to lose?"". The second bard says, ""Oh but you have already lost, I befriended the dragon last night"". 

The Moral of the Story, **The early Bard gets the Wyrm**

1342605204.0,269,self.rpg,wr3q4,"When did this hobby become ""ME, ME, ME!""?",AllUrMemes,400,131,396,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/wr3q4/when_did_this_hobby_become_me_me_me/,"I have to say, lately I've become increasingly alarmed at the selfishness and immaturity that I've seen displayed by some of my players, people on this subreddit, at game stores, etc.

More and more, I see people using the ""anything-goes"" concept of the RPG *as a license to be selfish, whiny, and obnoxious.* Ok, we get it, your thief is a greedy swindler whose alignment is Neutral Evil.  But is this serving to add flavor to the game, or is it an excuse for you to act on your (very real) selfish desires to hoard treasure, gain power, and hog the limelight?

I have one player who is usually an absolute JOY to have at the table.  He really shines at role-playing and I love to converse with him as an NPC.  But the moment he gets a few bad rolls in combat, and GOD FORBID his character gets hit IN A BATTLE, he sullenly pouts.  Missed attack ""Oh of course.""  Rolls to hit ""doesn't matter anyway, not gonna hit.""

With a lot of younger players, I feel like the moment you throw a little bit of adversity at them, they either shut down or throw a fit.  ""MY CHARACTER SERVED IN THE ELITE ELVEN RANGER REGIMENT AND ALWAYS WALKS FACING BACKWARDS HE WOULD NEVER GET AMBUSHED."" Are you going to have your mom call me and complain that you failed a Perception roll and got ambushed?

Is it fun for people to always win?  To find powerful magic items EVERY battle?  Doesn't that ultimately just cheapen them?  Isn't it more fun to earn things- to pay the iron price?  When you struggled to survive against a few goblins at level 1, doesn't it feel AWESOME to come back at level 8 and drive them before you, hearing the lamentation of their women?

I'm starting to get scared of writing adventures, because I worry that any of the failures and problems that are necessary to build tension in a story aren't fun for some players.  What am I supposed to do when you make a really bad roll and the rules say you just lost your arm?  I either make up some lame way out for you, destroying the credibility of the game, or I watch you sulk for the rest of the night.



What's the solution?  Maybe we all need to take a moment and remember why we are playing this game: to have a fun, enjoyable game where we can act out our fantasies and build better bonds with each other.  Playing an RPG is no different than ANYTHING you do in life- have your fun, but keep other people's interests in mind.

Great example: in a recent campaign, the PC's had to put to rest an ancient forest guardian who had lived long past his prime and become crazed with madness.  The guardian inhabited the form of a massive (20 ft tall) grizzly bear.  I made it abundantly clear that this bear could and would tear them to shreds if they tried to rush in without a plan.  

There were a series of mini-quests that would make the fight easier: securing some tree forts that would give elevated position to archers, obtaining and planting posioned mushrooms to sicken and fatigue the bear, and so forth.  The players did most of them, and also created a dead-fall trap with a giant elm tree.  But after springing the trap and wounding the bear pretty badly, one of my players rushed in to be the hero and attacked single-handedly.

Within 2 turns, he was reduced to a fine pink mist- the massive damage, beyond-all-hope-of-resurrection kind of death.  I was heartbroken for him because he was my very good friend and really identified with the character (his first ever in an RPG).  He just stood stunned for a second and then said.... ""Well, that was not a very smart decision."", and then laughed it off, and watched the rest of the battle, rooting on his team.  No rage quit, no ""that bonus shouldn't be so high"", just acceptance of his mistake and some bad rolls.

After the game, I went up to him and gave him a hug and told him I felt really bad that I massacred his character.  He said it was ok, and that ""it wouldn't be fun if there weren't consequences.""  

I know not everyone feels the same way, but I certainly do.

So, for this one campaign, I'm a hobbit Barbarian/Frenzied Berserker (ridiculous, right?) chilling in camp, eating, drinking, smoking hobbit weed, and generally being merry while we wait to hear from the elves. We have a very large group (11 people), and a couple of the players are not so bright. One of them decides he wants to fuck with the rest of us by using a magic ring and his disguise/bluff/perform skills to pretend to be Galadriel (we're camped outside Lothlorien at the time). 

Another party member, a Paladin/Samurai, is having none of it, and instantly sees through the disguise. My (now drunk and high) hobbit, however, does not, and gets excited about the Lady being here. The Paladin/Samurai and I begin arguing about whether or not its really her. This (for some reason) upsets the Samurai/Paladin, who decides the best course of action is to slap me, in an attempt to make me see reason (or something).

Hang on, let's backtrack for just a second here...

&gt; I'm a hobbit Barbarian/**Frenzied Berserker**

In case you don't know, Frenzied Berserker is basically a Barbarian +++ prestige class. They have a Frenzy ability that's better than (and also stacks with) Berserk. The downside is, you are FORCED to attack when in Frenzy. If there are no perceived enemies, you attack the nearest person until you succeed a Will check to end Frenzy. You also enter Frenzy anytime you take damage (unless you succeed a Will save to prevent it).

Oh boy. I tentatively raise my hand and go, ""Umm. He just dealt subdual damage to me.""

This is the point where it's easy to separate the smart people in the group from the slower ones - most of the table immediately groaned and/or facepalmed. The paladin, however, asked what that meant. So, while everyone *else* at the table rolled for initiative, I fail my Will save to prevent Frenzy.

I drop the Samurai/Paladin in one unarmed Power Attack. Then I start Cleaving - something Frenzied Berserkers can do *unlimited times*. And the entire party is sitting within Cleaving distance from each other.

End result, 7 out of the 11 party members are dead - the rest teleported away. All over a single point of subdual damage.",,False,,t5_2qh2s,False,,,True,t3_uaqyc,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/uaqyc/lets_hear_some_horror_stories_what_are_the_most/,

(PF),SethBullockDead,355,83,158,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1fx28o/so_i_accidentally_spoiled_my_dms_plot_twist_ten/,"So, we're playing Pathfinder, and the situation my party is in is that a man we are pretty sure is innocent of a crime (call it 90% sure), is going to likely be put to death for it by a corrupt lord.  To counter this, we need to find evidence to turn the town against him.

We send our two super sneaky Kobolds into his keep to search for clues.  As they are searching, the GM throws out multiple references to the Lord's dead family who had perished a year before.  Without really thinking about it, I blurt out ""What if they're bribing him by resurrecting his family?"".  The instant I say this, my DM turns and glares at me.  One of the Kobolds then opens the door to a room in the keep, and there he is, the Lord's son: alive, well, and resurrected.

I will never forget the look that my DM gave me in that exact moment.  It was awesome. 

EDIT: People are pulling negative vibes from this post.  It wasn't awesome because of me revealing the DM's plans, it was awesome because of the sheer timing of it.  I dropped the bomb, literally before the twist was about to be revealed.  Like seriously, seconds before.

EDIT #2: People are making an assumption that my DM was angry at me over this.  He wasn't.  He was a little disappointed, but he wasn't angry, and even admitted that the reaction of me predicting the twist was better than the twist was going to me.

This can be frustrating to some GMs and their fellow players who want to thoughtfully weigh their choices.  I want to introduce a situation where you can really force your players to think about the consequences of their actions.

In town the adventurers hear reports of a wizard abducting children in the night and bringing them to his tower in the outskirts of the village.  The townspeople plead that the adventurers get their children back by any means necessary.  They also warn that he is amassing a goblin army and they have set up a camp outside his tower.

Once they arrive at the tower they find the goblins outside being rather docile (sleepy, don't see the party coming).  Give them the opportunity to notice that the goblins are not acting aggressively, but do not directly state that the goblins are not a threat.  The players may then decide to engage.  In combat make the goblins panicky, running away and fighting only when cornered.  Give the players a chance to hunt down runners if they so choose.

The next logical step is for them to climb the tower.  Once they reach the top they find the wizard and engage him.  After they kill him they find scrolls and scrolls of ""baneful polymorph"" and no sign of the children.  If you want to spin some RPG elements have them revert to children once the wizard is dead to really nail in hard that every goblin was actually a child and they killed the children they intended to save.

With this scenario, an observant player would have noticed that goblins don't behave this way normally and the whole situation is fishy.  A person who just hacks and slashes through everything now has the guilt of killing children on their conscience and may think twice about that strategy in the future.

**Edit:**  I realize that killing children doesn't go over very well with most people (especially in the light of recent real-life events), so you could change the scenario slightly to make it adults, but still innocent people.  This situation is designed to make the player feel guilty and that's why it was designed with such a powerful guilt-tripping event such as killing a child accidentally.

While my family is lucky in the sense that we were not personally affected by the bombings, we do know people who were.

Among all of us that have to deal with the senselessness and horror of this event, I know my kids are deeply effected by this. Especially in the case of my younger daughter.  Kids don’t always have the vocabulary and certainly don’t have the emotional intelligence of an adult – and it can be very hard for them to verbalize their fears, concerns and questions about events like this.  They internalize their fears and just can’t always talk about them easily with us adults. The ones charged with protecting them and easing their pain, both physical and emotional, as best we can.

A few years ago I created a simple little game called Argyle &amp; Crew, partly to address this very issue. Using sock puppets and creative role play, it can be a tool for allowing children to express their concerns and fears in a controlled, fun and positive environment.

If you’re someone with kids of their own, or who work with kids who need a creative outlet – whether to express their feelings or simply take their minds of current events, you may find this helpful. If so, I’d love for you to have a copy. [This link will bring you to DriveThruRPG’s site](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/index.php?discount=7085) (you’ll need an account there) and put a PDF copy of Argyle &amp; Crew into your cart for free.

Argyle &amp; Crew will be free until the end of this month, for whatever reason you’d care to download it. Please help yourself and hopefully this will bring a few more smiles to life.

This lead to the best part of the evening when in her rush to search, she had her thief go into a room oozing with green slime, who then had her arms quickly covered in green slime when it attacked from above. Her sister quickly reasoned that since the slime ate through the thief's leather armor that it most likely would eat through anything so she attacked it ""with the one thing it couldn't eat, FIRE!"" (these were exact words when I asked her what made her think of that). She grab the torched and went to town on the green slime.

Within an hour of playtime, one character was slammed hard by a Shambling Mound for damage equal to 3x his HP.  
  
""Ohhh mannn... right off the bat,"" he moaned, and sat back in his chair, bummed. It wasn't the first character of his to die, but it certainly was the quickest. And he had put a lot of background work into the character, and even planned out the level progression in his downtime at work.  
  
The GM took pity on him, and said, ""Well, you know what, I think your armor did a great job of absorbing the impact, and you only take &lt;rolls&gt; 3 damage.""  
  
He breathed a sigh of relief, and didn't make eye contact with the rest of us for a while. We're a tight-knit group, and we weren't going to say anything about it. The GM had spoken. But there is shame in having the GM publicly fudge something to save your character.  
  
Not too much later, another player rolled a natural 1 in combat. We have a house rule where either the GM can make a determination of what happens, or the player can roll a percentile on our infamous CRITICAL SUCCESSES AND FAILURES chart. He chose the chart, reasoning that we'd all been rolling low on the chart all night. But he rolled high -- and 89, in fact -- which, according to the chart, means he has tripped, fallen on his sword for triple damage, and is stunned for 1 round. Ouch.  
  
Except, again, the damage came out to roughly 3x this player's HP, too. ""Well that's a shitty way to go,"" he said, and sat back, clearly disappointed. But again, the GM took pity, and ruled he was merely at 0 HP, and unconscious. He frowned, and quietly stared at his character sheet for a while, again with no eye contact for some time. Again, we said nothing.  
 
In both instances, I wasn't really sure how both players felt. But this second character kvetched about the incident on Facebook the next day, and said he'd have preferred to have his character killed. We talked about it, and he felt that while having a character killed sucks, and having a character killed in such an embarrassing fashion sucks even harder, the fact that everyone seems to be routinely saved from certain death took something out of the game, and that sucked worst of all.  
  
I tend to agree. **GMs - Some of us like ""hard mode.""** Killing off a character is a pretty hard thing to do, but sometimes, it can be worse to not do it. If you are going to fudge a roll to save a character, do so behind your screen, and without ever revealing that the character should have died. **It is my opinion that preserving an exciting, dangerous atmosphere is more important than preserving a character.**  
  
The only exception to this, I think, is the case of new players. If their first character is killed off quickly, it can make the game seem much less fun for them. But veteran players come to learn that character death happens, and are generally OK with it.

Might be a little snug but it's better safe then sorry. Plus it smells like some one is having a BBQ and you need to pick up some hot dogs from the store. You know the rules no shirt no shoes no service.**

And so we end with a mostly dressed John. He has tennis shoes and denim shorts, and now the t shirt of a 12 year old boy. Good job, John. 

*I'm going to post a score update and game briefing now.*


------PART 1-------

Hello, Reddit. Today we're going to play a game. In this game, every player is John. You see, John is a bit crazy, and is more often led around by the Voices in his head than his own stream of consciousness. Each Redditor will be a Voice in John's head, and each Voice will have an obsession. By completing their obsession, the Voices amass points, and the Voice with the most points when the game ends wins.

To play, choose an obsession (which can range from something as crazy as climbing a skyscraper from the outside to as mundane yet strange as filling your pockets with live aquarium fish) and begin working towards it.

In the spirit of Everyone is John's competitive nature, your obsession should remain a secret to the other Voices. When you begin posting, please message to me your obsession. Its difficulty will determine how many points you get each time your obsession is accomplished by John, no matter who does it. I'm not going to accept something as simple as ""touch doorknobs,"" so be creative. 

**Even Redditors who do not want to be Voices are important players in this game of Everyone is John!** In the unique environment Reddit gives us, upvoters get to act as John's Conscience, which he usually lacks, quite strangely.  The Voice who receives the most upvotes will be implemented into the story of John's day. and the Voices will act from then on.

**Now then, let's begin.**

It is a cold, rainy day in Minneapolis. Like many days in Minneapolis, John awakes wearing nothing but denim short shorts on the fire escape of an unknown brick building. As he observes his surroundings, John sees that he is approximately three stories from the ground. The fire escape extends at least a dozen stories above. Loud voices can be heard through the window, cracked ever so slightly open, to his left. John considers going each way, but does not wish to anger the Voices that wait in his ear, so he sits, and he waits.

**In an effort to save time, John listens to the first Voice that suggests an action. From here on out, the actions will be determined one half hour from the event. So just after 7 AM central time John will make his next move. This should give his Conscience enough time to decide.**

John remembers two things. First, it's cold and rainy. Second, he's wearing denim short shorts. Valthek suggests he go inside, which to cold, wet John sounds like a splendid idea. Besides, Valthek suggests, there could be food in there, and nice people who can give him said food. John lifts the window, which jams about half way up, but manages to squeeze in and plop onto the shag rug. The walls are covered with portraits of a happy family, several involving the cat, a rather long-haired royal looking type, a 12 year old boy, and the plastic-smiled parents.

""And don't get me started on your brother. He's going back to his apartment TONIGHT or I SWEAR---,"" the man pauses his rant, seeing the muffin topped man who just crawled through his window. 

John smells for food, and from that is able to deduce ""meat."" 

""Or I ... swear... ... Jane... Get the phone.""

**7 AM Central: Wow, that man looks angry. Well-fed, but angry. You know what would calm him down John? Dancing. Dancing always makes everything better. Dance, John, dance until the world stops spinning.**

Corund is right, thinks John. This situation calls for DANCING! John lifts himself from the floor and spreads his arms above him like the wings of the beautiful swan that he is. Droplets of rain splatter across the apartment as John begins to spin, twirl, and, frankly, dance, like nobody has ever before, and perhaps never should again.

The man holds the phone, completely stunned in awe of John's... skill. Jane, likewise, stands like the deer she slightly resembles in the headlights. John continues to spin until he realizes the spinning is making him feel quite sick. John is going to vomit... but... where? He is currently standing the living room. Behind the confused couple can be seen a sink, and presumably the rest of a kitchen as well. There is a door to the right, and a hallway to the left.

**7:30 AM Central: Okay John, I got this. This guy's angry, but really, he's not. Did I tell you I have a degree in psychology? no? Well, I do.
Anyway, this guy's more scared than angry, really. He might get agressive. We don't want that. You should give him hug! Yeah, a real good hug! Like you really like him! That's a great plan.
Don't mind the feeling in your stomach. It's just nervousness anyway.**

Yes... Valthek has been right so far. I mean, John isn't getting rained on anymore, right? John approaches the man, still frozen in fear, and opens his arms wide. His wet skin bonds with the dry flannel jacket worn by the man, and together in John's dizziness they topple to the kitchen tile. They share a moment on the floor, and John feels accepted.

Jane screams.

John vomits.

The man screams.

In from the hallway walks a 12 year old boy holding a cat. ""Why is everyone screaming?"" he asks, before seeing the vomit on the kitchen floor.

The boy vomits.

The cat screams.

**8 AM Central: Pst! John! You're still hungry. And vomiting this guy just cleared some space. Let's go raid the kitchen. There's bound to be SOMETHING in the place to eat. ...You know, we've always liked chinese food. And that kid is holding on to some. I bet we could make a mean dish out of that cat.**

The meat! John knows what the smell of meat was! Cat, most surely. Thank you, aythrea. And ya know, John feels a lot less dizzy now that he is done vomiting. What did he just vomit up?... Is that a key? Well that's interesting. At least it's out of his system now. Where was John?... Oh yes. The cat. 

John lifts himself from the tile and begins to walk toward the cat which, in its cat frenzy, pries itself from the young boys grip and flees towards the open window. 

""Freckles, no!"" shouts the boy, who chases the cat onto the fire escape.

""Billy, no!"" shouts the mother, who slips and falls onto the tile floor.

The cat! Yes! John, too, runs towards the open window, but finds himself once again stuck in its jammed state, leaving his lower half still in the apartment.

**8:30 AM Central: Hey, John, you're stuck. Pull yourself out of that window. There you go. Now why don't you get that nice, shiny key off that man. You should probably take his shoes, to. You need them more than he does. Now just go out that door. -- The 9 AM update will be followed by a substantial break. I'll be leaving for work, and will be able to update around 1:30 or so. The game will continue at 5:30 PM. This should allow people to catch up, and new players to decide their obsessions and get a feel for the game.**

The window didn't work out so well, John realizes. Windows often don't, even if they are his only salvation from the walls. Regardless, it looks like we'll have to walk this time. What did the Voice suggest?... Shoes! Right. A man needs shoes, and who knows what kind of situation John would be in if he made them out of his precious denim short shorts? 

John goes back to the man and takes off his shoes. He's becoming fashionable already! Good job, John.

""What do you want from us? Is it money? We have money! I can give you money! Just please! Leave us alone!"" The woman appears to be begging for her life. It's probably not often John comes through her window. 

Regardless, John has a key now, and keys open things! This looks like it opens a locker of some sort. I wonder WHERE in Minneapolis John has been? Let's find out! 

John exits the door into the stairwell. He can go up or down. Does anyone else smell smoke?

**9 AM Central: Well now you're in a predicament John. You can't go out any further because of the window but maybe you can go back into the apartment and find another way outside to chase the delicious cat.**

The cat went up. John goes up! Besides, he's running away from the smoke if he runs up, yea? It's the perfect plan. After several tiring minutes, John arrives at the roof. Across the roof John sees Billy and Freckles. 

**It is here, where a middle aged man wearing nothing but stolen shoes and denim short shorts, faces a frightened 12 year old boy and his cat of the roof of an apartment building. What will John do? What will John say? Will John ever eat the cat? Post your ideas below and I'll have the big update, Everyone is John Part 2, up in a few hours. **

------- Part 2 --------

**[1:30 Update]
John, look at that poor cat! Its terrified of that horrible little boy! I bet when no one is looking that little brat smears chewing gum on that lovely little kitty! CATS HATE GUM! We need to get Mr. Freckles away from Billy! Cats land on their feet right? THROW FRECKLES TO FREEDOM! SPREAD YOUR WINGS, FRECKLES! SPREAD YOUR GLORIOUS FELINE WINGS!**

John! Don't listen to the clown! Save the cat!.... John?... You're listening to the clown?

John, wearing nothing but his denim short shorts and tennish shoes, standing in the rain on the roof of an apartment building in Minneapolis, charges at the boy. He MUST. FREE. FRECKLES.

Billy, in his horror, turns and slips on tar rooftop, leaving Freckles running frightened in the rain. John turns just in time to land on the cat... ""saving"" him. John throws Freckles over the rooftop into the storm. Billy sits in tears, although we can't see them. The only way to tell the tears from the rain is their salty taste. A salt that John can almost taste over the distance between them.

**6:30 PM Update:
Hurrah, John! Hurrah! You've purged the world of the feline villain! But it's not enough, John. Cats have nine lives, John. The boy. The boy is the answer. His tears. HIS TEARS. They fall with the rain, onto the cold street below: onto Freckles. They shall give him new life. You can't allow that, John. Take his tears, John. Take them, and bear them away from this... this pit, this rain-slicked parapet of evil. Take them, John.**

The tears... Yes, of course! The tears! John sees it now... The boy crying.. The rain... The dead cat... It all makes sense now... He thinks. To truly defeat the delectable Mr. Freckles, he must defeat the tears themselves. 

John lunges at and lifts the screaming 12 year old over his bare shoulder then flees down the fire escape. Halfway down, however, he realizes... Just how does one DEFEAT tears? Where do you take them?",,False,,t5_2qh2s,1367002341.0,,,True,t3_1d2qt4,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1d2qt4/everyone_is_john_upvotes_experiment/,

Interesting premise, but the article doesn't cite any external sources that I can see. Historically, many RPG publishers are reticent about publishing hard sales numbers for their products, so such a claim stood out to me. Too, I haven't seen anything anywhere that sales of video games are slowing. Thirdly, I'm sure that even if video game sales are down, their total volume is still likely higher than that of table-top RPGs. 

In support of the article, however, it is cheaper to buy an RPG, game with a big group of friends repeatedly for a long time, than it is for several people to buy gaming consoles and games. Too, most of the serious console gamers I know don't do a great deal of replay. They'll play the heck out of a game when they get it, playing for days or weeks, beating it in every possible way and iteration, but after that? Meh, it either sits on a shelf, gets sold, or traded away.

Now let me set the outline for you. The PCs have just decided to enact their plan to save 3 fellow PCs suspended above a soup pot in a rather mundane orcish dungeon, the distance to the pot is only 15ft. and the party's halfling thief, the famed Yollo Swaggins has managed to get his hands free from his rope bindings. 

After initiative is rolled the aforementioned Yollo frees his feet and swings across the 10ft pit that leads to safety (Making a great deal of successful checks in the process.) His last obstacle before freedom is a single orc berserker who he has provoked an attack of opportunity from. The orc readies his battle axe and makes a definite hit on young Swaggins knocking him from his rope to the edge of the pit where he makes a save in order to clasp onto the edge.

Unfortunately for Yollo this proximity allows the orc to make an attack on him on his turn. The attack connects! Sending him tumbling into the pit. At this point Yollo is on -6 hp and as such surivival lies in the hands of the dice. The damage is rolled in the open bringing Yollo to -15hp killing him outright. As he fell his last words rang true to the party... ""420blazeeeee!""
The real kicker of the story lies in two factors however: 

1. Yollo had entered the campaign only minutes before.  

2. He died irreversibly in his first round of combat ever.

So my question to you, reddit: what moment, large or small, has your character had that made him/her a badass without the aid of the dice?

I was playing a pathfinder game that took us to a royal court known for its assassinations and general back-stabbing. We were there accompanying/protecting a diplomat who was trying to develop an alliance between our nation and theirs. We knew going in to the grand feast that first night that one of the king's rivals would undoubtedly try to poison one of us (or the diplomat) in order to sour relations between our people, and so it became my job to use Detect Poison as each dish was served.

At the end of the night, the poison arrived with the dessert. Sitting atop the diplomat's iced delicacy, there was a cherry injected with one of the strongest poisons I've ever encountered. I was able to identify it and though I can't remember what it was, it had around a DC 35 save. I informed the diplomat and the king as subtly as I could. The king called for the attention of the court, plucked the cherry off the diplomat's dessert and held it up, asking what we should do with it. Most people seemed confused, since he didn't actually announce that it was poisoned, but it was immediately obvious who the culprits were by their reactions. 

There was silence for a moment while the poisoners squirmed and then I stood alongside the king and asked him if I might have the cherry. He handed it to me, curious, and I turned, locked eyes with the culprits and popped it into my mouth. I even made a show of enjoying it. Reactions varied from horror to shock to outright laughter.

1352844246.0,248,self.rpg,135921,"""Insurance Fraud"": A quick, easy adventure hook that introduces a few scummy NPC's.",AllUrMemes,284,36,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/135921/insurance_fraud_a_quick_easy_adventure_hook_that/,"Thought I would share this hook.  I have used it in several campaigns to get new players introduced to my world, one full of selfish, scheming folk who love to prey on brave but foolish ""heroes"".

Summary: Low level PC's are new to town and in need of work, but are unqualified for most of the ""hired sword"" jobs.  They eventually find a merchant named Schmidt who offers to pay them a small amount for a short, easy merchant caravan escort.  It is a safe route that takes all of about 3 days.

Schmidt says that he wouldn't even bother hiring security for the route (being so close to the city), but his insurer- DeVries and Sons Bank- requires it per their insurance contract.

The PC's leave with the merchant caravan.  The first day passes uneventfully, and there is plenty of traffic on the main thoroughfare.  On the second day, the caravan driver calls a halt and pulls off the road to ""water the horses"".  

Shortly thereafter, a group of armed men crest the nearby hill.  A friendly conversation between the armed men and the caravan driver takes place.  The caravan driver explains to the PC's that they have been the victim of a necessary deception.  They will actually be turning over the caravan cargo to these men, per Schmidt's orders.  He produces a signed note from Schmidt to verify.  The driver apologizes for the deception and says that Schmidt will be paying them double the agreed amount for their trouble.

Basically, Schmidt is running an insurance fraud scam.  He insures his cargo and allows it to be ""robbed"" and fenced.  He gets the insured value back from the bank, plus a cut of the stolen goods.

The caravan driver requests that the PC's help unload the cargo and stash it in a nearby cave.  Once they are inside the small cave, the thugs (apologetically) explain that they have to kill the PC's to make the ""robbery"" look legit.   The thugs (3-5 of them) are a moderate challenge for the low-level PC's, plus they have them cornered in the cave.

When the PC's gain the upper hand in battle, one of the robbers will attempt to flee and alert Schmidt of what happened. If the PC's get in trouble, you can have some travelers from the road hear the fighting and come bail them out.  In either case, the caravan driver has long since fled.

The Aftermath:  At this point, the PC's have a lot of options.  (I'm a big fan of sandbox games.)  They can report what happened to local authorities, or to the DeVries and Sons Bank (who may hire the PC's to investigate Schmidt or find out who is fencing all the stolen goods and shipping them out of town).  The PC's can go directly to Schmidt and confront him, though murdering him in broad daylight is likely to get them locked up. 

Schmidt realizes he underestimated the PC's, and may offer to pay them off to leave him alone.  He might even offer them a job and let them in on his scheme.  Obviously, he can't be trusted- but he has coin and connections, both of which the PC's lack.  

I have had a lot of success with this little hook because it is believable and easy to get players on without railroading them.  Then you have a nice little skirmish, and from there the players have any number of options to deal with the fallout.

I'm also new to the rules, decided to run a few games with it until my copy of Edge of the Empire is shipped.

I'm actually fond of the [Han Solo Trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Han_Solo_Trilogy) and had my players start on the planet Ylesia. They were a two man crew, a scoundrel and a scout, and since they were new to the game I wanted to hit home that they're in the starwars universe and can become iconic characters of their own - rivalling Han Solo and Chewbacca.

The party infiltrated a spice manufacturing racket pretending to be a cult, and were looking to rob the cult blind. Han and Chewie land the Falcon at the manufacturing facility to deliver a shipment of offworld chemicals they need for their operations and begin discussing price. While they're busy my coworker, who I suckered into playing the game, sneaks into their ship and sabotages their engines, removing a key part then sneaks back out.

Han and Chewie try to lift off after finishing their negotiations and the engines fail. Chewie goes in the back to figure out what happened and concludes that a key engine part is missing, which is probably floating in space right now. They head into the city to get a new part. My coworker sneaks back in, repairs the engines with the part he stole, and makes his way to the cockpit.

I'm starting to figure out whats going on and warn my player that ships in starwars are locked, they have a 'key' system of sorts. Of course he rolled really high on his mechanics check and was able to hotwire the falcon, got the other player on board, and they both took off. I'm sitting their dumbfounded, realizing that level 1 characters have just stolen the most famous ship in all of starwars history. O.o

Over the course of fulfilling his obsessions, he committed assault, indecent exposure, theft, vandalism, fraud, impersonated a police officer, destroyed priceless works of art, and scalped movie tickets.

I was wondering if you guys had some good, easy to pull scams we might have missed. Some stuff we will be doing:

**Sell treasure map booster packs.** Basically TCG style treasure maps, where the most important is of course not offered in the packs.

**Sell a genie in a bottle.** Some smoke we have trapped in a bottle. We'll be very annoyed when a player sets the genie free.

**4n+1 token scam.** Not sure of the exact name. We start of with 4n+1 tokens. The other player goes first, takes 1,2 or 3 tokens, then I do the same, making sure to always make sure to remove 4 in total (ie if he takes 1, I take 3). Player who takes the last stone loses, which is always him. This is done on a bet of gold coins

**Tarot Reading.** Just tell people what they wish to hear.

**Liar's Dice.** A very fun die game (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar's_Dice). Shame my friend and I will be signing our dice to each other.

**Sell deeds to land.** We have some skills which allows us to forge these. Of course, the land lies a couple of days travel away, so we'll have no problem getting out before we get disgruntled customers.

**Sell Aqua Vitae.** Drink it to stay alive, cheaper than a healing potion. Of course, it's just water, but hey, if you don't drink water you die.

So, any scams or con-games you ever pulled in an rpg session/larp?

(Will update to tell you guys how horrible we died if there is an interest).

They offered me a soda (for a mere .65 cents) and said that there was going to be a D&amp;D Encounters starting up tonight and that I could hang out until the DM showed up. I browsed the shop, flipped through some of the DnD books, and watched bits and pieces of a MtG game.

The DM showed up about 15 minutes later, and he and the other 6 players who had been filtering in since I had been there sat down around a table and began taking out their materials and introducing themselves. Some had obviously known each other for a long time, others were just meeting. I had been speaking to one of the players, an older gentleman who noticed me staring slack-jawed at some of the gorgeous miniatures, and had struck up a conversation, asking if I currently played. Told him that I played a LOT of PnP RPGs back in middle school (a decade ago), but hadn't since, and wanted to watch a game or two to get a refresher.

To get to the point, as they were sitting down, the gentleman I had been speaking to told the DM that he wanted to give up his seat to let me play. I was caught off guard and fervently refused at first, telling them that I appreciated the offer, but that they should just go along as planned, and I would just watch, since I hadn't played in so long. The DM says, ""You know what, I can handle doing a 7-person party, go ahead and grab one of the pre-made's and give it a try, it's honestly the best way to get back into it.""

5 minutes later I had become Belgos, a Drow Ranger, with a penchant for hunting demons. Despite having not played in a decade (back during 3.0/3.5), I fell right back into the groove, cracking jokes about magic missiles that few of my friends would laugh at, or even understand, strategically thinking out my next best move, and swearing silently under my breath at every botched roll.

Needless to say, I had a fantastic time, and the group invited me back out for next week's encounter, which I definitely plan on attending. The whole point of this story is that it reminded me once again WHY I play these games and how wrong the stereotypes are about D&amp;D players being these anti-social losers. They're not, they're actually incredibly friendly and helpful people, who go out of their way to make sure people feel included in any situation they can. I had a fantastic time, and now I'll have an outlet to play a character during the week, once I start DMing on the weekend for my small group of friends who are just now willing to give it a try. Sorry if you read this far and are disappointed by the lack of some awesome climactic ending, but I just wanted to share my experience.

""so i told you about how killen is stuck in some kind of dungeons and dragons limbo, playing with some of the most tepid human beings to ever grace the diagnosis of aspergers ever, right?

Well, about an hour after you called me and told me about that hook-up, killen calls me to tell me about how his THIRD CHARACTER THIS CAMPAIGN just died last night.

oh boy.

""Well, we killed these monsters, right, and then we got the deck of many things."" RED FLAG.

So first things first, Rick, captain career player, the guy who can't go ten minutes without popping open a splat book and looking something up, actually does something interesting. He goes for the power draw and just beefs a handful of cards off the top... and actually does ok.

first card. free 10,000 xp. bossy.

second card. lose all mundane objects and currency. OH NO! NOT MY NON-MAGIC ITEM MATERIAL WEALTH. I'LL HAVE TO BORROW ROPE AND TORCHES FROM EVERYONE ELSE IN THE PARTY IN THE HISTORY OF DND EVER.

Third card. get a free keep. WELL I WAS WORRIED ABOUT LOSING ALL MY SHIT, THEN I GOT MY OWN CASTLE. LOL.

fourth card- get fucked, fight a dread wraith. This would have been a problem, if not for 2 things- 1, Rick is a cleric and he just leveled from that  10,000xp card. 2- Rick was wearing some kind of magic boots of gayness that gave him a 70 feet move speed, so he just sprinted away from the dread wraith to go pray up some new spells then ran back later. Ok, so put that mental image in your head- there's a cleric, wearing his nikes, running away from this intelligent undead until he can put enough distance between them to charge up his ghostbuster powers, then come back and shit-kick it.

Well that's nice.

Let's go around the table to our next contestant, Douchebag the Rogue.

Douchebag the rogue is one of those career assholes who plays the bad guy, and then hides behind his career choice by roleplaying it away. Or at least, that's his modus operandii. STEAL SHIT FROM THE PARTY. ITS NOT PERSONAL GUYS, I'M JUST PLAYING MY CHARACTER.

Remember that. All campaign, its the same story- ITS NOT PERSONAL BRO, IM JUST PLAYING MY CHARACTER.

Keep repeating that mantra Douchey, keep believing it will save you. BECAUSE TONIGHT, YOU.



Ok, so lets get back to killen. He rips one right off the top of the deck and BAM- what an epic peel. Void. He gets teleported to the lower planes.

NOW HERE'S THE FUN PART.

Killen manages, through some feat of DM handwaving or pure serendipity, to get an audience with a demon prince. The Demon prince tells him, ""Sure buddy, I'll send you back to the prime material, but these are the rules- you're chaotic evil now, and you have to take this soul gem with you, and kill ten beings more powerful than yourself and also you must slay the followers of Bahamut and defile their temples wherever you cross their paths. 10 souls, you're off the hook.""

So Killen says, OK, gets back in the demonic Bill and Ted telephone booth, and zap, he's right back where he was standing 2 minutes ago before the yawning cavernous abyss ripped reality asunder and swallowed his soul.

""So uh, where you been?"" The party asks.

Fortunately, Killen isn't stupid. He knows if he tells the party that he just made a deal with Draino-Robo-Satan from the Lower Plane of Bowel Obstruction or whatever, the party is going to murder him and take his stuff, and because he's chaotic evil now, TECHNICALLY UNDER THE RULES OF DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS OBJECTIVE ALIGNMENT, they'll totally sleep well at night knowing they did a good deed.

So Killen bluffs them. Successfully. through a miraculous die roll. ""BRO, JUST TAKING A POWER NAP.""

Oh wait, no we aren't satisfied with that. Because this is a crappy group of career D&amp;D players and dickhole metagamers to boot. So this conversation goes on for like 20 minutes.

In the middle of the dungeon. Where they just killed some driders. HOLD ON GUYS, WE'RE GONNA STAND HERE AND TALK ABOUT THIS. RIGHT NOW.

Meanwhile, The DM is rolling dice behind his screen, getting an erection, and telling people to take listen checks.

""Bro, tell us what really happened or I'm casting suggestion.""
""bro, don't be a dick bro.""
""come clean bro, don't make me bro down.""
""oh so now you have the brothority to call a bro down, bro?""
""bro i'll do it bro""
""Hey wait seriously, I think I hear monsters.""
""Don't try to change the subject, bro.""
""Nah bro really, take a spellcraft check- they're outside that door casting buff spells on themselves, bro.""
""You bluffin me again bro?""
""Bro!""

-ROLL INITIATIVES-

(Not actually the conversation verbatim, but fairly accurate.)

So it turns out, there's this awesome concealed titanium door or some garbage secret entrance or plot hole that this giant Drow war party outside can just pop right open and walk through. Yea whatever, underdark or something. Shit happens.

So now the party is fighting these mobs. Killen charges in and starts facefucking left and right, because he's some kind of perfect alchemy of fighter feats and prestige classes that allows him to deal 100+ damage a round... at level 4. Whatever, D&amp;D 3.5 is a good game. There's no possible reason why anyone would want to play Pathfinder or 4E instead. Nope, none at all.

Eventually though, the party realizes that they're fighting what is fundamentally the entire house guard of house bitchestopheles of menzoberenzenrenenenan, and decide to book it.

So, as the king of all DICK MOVES, Douchey the rogue shuts and bars the super plot hole door of badness to keep the mobs out.

With Killen on the other side. ten feet away from it.

""Dude what the fuck. I was gonna be through that door like next round.""

""ITS NOT PERSONAL BRO, ITS WHAT MY CHARACTER WOULD HAVE DONE."" famous last words, motherfucker.

What Douchey did not account for was how good Killen was at minmaxing, and that he was a dungeon crasher- a prestige class literally designed to hockey check people into walls and knock down doors.

SO GUESS WHO KNOCKS DOWN THE FUCKING DOOR, ITS KILLEN, OUT OF LEFT FIELD. CAN'T BREAK MY STRIDE, CALL THE COPS I DON'T GIVE A FUCK.

meanwhile, the party is booking it.

party successfully books it.

They all meet up again and look who is back? Its Rick the cleric with his nikes, and after running halfway across the country like Forrest Gump or some shit, he's back to fight that dread wraith, which has pretty much just been hanging out and waiting patiently.

""Sup.""

""Ok I can fight you now.""

""Ok, remember the rules, if any of your buddies help, another one of me pops up and fights them, and it goes on like that, et cetera.""

""Yea whatever, i ain't scurred. bring it, Slimer.""

So the party gathers around and watches as the cleric first buffs himself to be immune to negative energy and energy drain, and then proceeds to begin the process of nickel-and diming the wraith to death by spontaneously casting his whole spell portfolio as cure spells.

Meanwhile, Douchey the rogue is standing near a wall. Killen 5 foot steps to the left to line up an ideal charge, that will result in a free bull rush into said wall, granting an extra twenty some odd bonus damage in change.

""Hey bro, remember how you locked me out of that room and left me to die, all platoon style with those drow?"" He asks Douchey the rogue.

""Yea, its not personal bro, I was just playing my character.""

""Yea, well, remember how I went to hell for a vacation and came back chaotic evil? So... I haven't really forgotten about that. Or forgiven. Also, I charge you. Does a 23 hit your AC? Yep, it does.""

""WHAT THE FUCK BRO""

""I charge you, hit, roll a pound of dice for damage because my character is power attacking with roided out min-max optimization, and then I freebie bull rush you into that wall and get another pound of dice. How's that floor taste, bro? Does it taste like all the teeth I just kicked out of your mouth?""

""WHAT THE FUCK BRO!""

""Its not personal bro, I'm just playing my character!""

Over the course of a single round of combat, Killen makes sure there's not enough left of Douchey the rogue to scoop into a soup can. The grand total ends up putting his hit points somewhere in the negative sixties.

The party naturally turns on Killen, casts blind, and puts him down.

Meanwhile, Douchey is furious. Killen is pretty much having the best day of his life.

""WHY'D YOU KILL ME, BRO?""

""ITS NOT PERSONAL BRO, JUST PLAYING MY CHARACTER!"" Killen sneers.

""Don't worry"" The party insists. ""We can just pool our money and raise dead you.""

""Well actually you can't."" Killen reminds them. ""Because I was carrying that evil soul gem on me, and it funneled away his spirit when I killed him. So uh, technically he's down in hell with me now. For eternity or until some demon eats his immortal essence for lunch, whatever comes first.""

I originally wanted to roll a fighter, but as they already had one I chose to play Paladin instead, since it's similar and I'd get a little magic too. 

When it came to game day, I was introduced and immediatly got pick-pocketed by a ""team-mate"". Then they spent the whole game bluffing me into fighting random thugs, and took all the ill gotten gains from it and selling them on the black market against my wishes. Finally, they all got wasted and got it on with some local ladies who we had just freed from a human trafficker, because again, the Rogue had massive bluff and promised them a huge payout. None of them got paid. I raised my concern, but the DM said that since I was bluffed, my character saw nothing wrong. He didn't even know about the prositution because they intentionally kept it from me. 

So yeah. Not the easiest team to play Pally for.

Edit: I also found out from one of the other players that I was filling in the slot for a player who had left recently, also a Paladin. They wouldn't tell me why he left, and I didn't really care, but seeing this I'm starting to wonder.

When 4th Edition was first released, the group I was with eagerly began a brand spanking new campaign with the brand spanking new rules system.  We were all veteran gamers, and though we had our interpersonal difficulties the group as a whole worked well together; even the asshole of the group could be relied on to flat-out demand fair rulings and reliance on even-handed systems.  This remains one of the best groups I've ever played with, and I miss them.

I digress for nostalgia.

Anyway, so our campaign was played in my personal setting, and the players opted to make their characters in the Greco-Roman themed area of the world.  Things went nicely, they uncovered an old sword which unleashed an ancient evil, and so the campaign became about putting that evil back where it belonged.  At one point, they ended up in an ancient temple near the edge of the world.

My setting is built in land fragments; floating chunks of planet that exist in an endless sky.  In certain places, you can fall of the edge of the world.  Near those edges there are often fissures, and many of said fissures extend all the way out the bottom of the land fragment.  The temple in which they were adventuring was subject to one of these fissures, though it only extended through one room and a couple hallways.

After clearing out several rooms of stirges and some worms, the group incorrectly deduced that they had cleared the entire temple.  They'd failed some Perception checks, if I remember correctly, and so they didn't hear the slight noises of an evil adventuring party laying in wait specifically for them in another part of the temple.  Thus, they decided they were good to go; the warlord more than the rest.  While everyone else was collecting the last treasure from the room where they'd beaten the worms, the warlord asked what was down one of the hallways.  I reiterated that he didn't hear anything, and updated the table map to show him the hallway down to the point it turned.  I also pointed out the fissure about three-quarters down.

""I run down the hallway as fast as I can.""

I still don't know why he said that, he's never explained himself, but I assume he just wanted a running start to jump the fissure.  Anyone can probably guess what happened next; he botched his Athletics check entirely.  What followed, as I wanted to be fair, was the must incredible series of continuous botches to catch himself that I have ever seen in my gaming life; one after another.  He finally caught himself, at the very bottom of the fissure, hanging over an endless sky; starving to death is how you die from such a fall, not impact.

The rest of the group, I'm sorry to say, had seen neither which hallway the warlord (their only healer) went down, nor could they hear his cries from that far down the fissure.  Though the players knew, the characters had to guess, and they guessed wrong.  They headed down another corridor, and walked dead-on into the waiting adventuring party.

What followed, lacking a healer, is one of the most brutal fights I've ever had to DM.  They put up a damn good struggle I'll give them that, even took out a couple of the enemy adventurers, but the fight had been intended to be difficult in the first place.  This group, even facing a loss, would never want me to fudge things.  So, one by one, they dropped.  I believe the warlock was the last standing, until eventually he was simply overwhelmed.

Eventually, only the warlord remained.  Still struggling up the fissure, making slow but steady progress, the sound of his climbing attracted the attention of the enemy adventurers.  They found the fissure he was in, and decided to wait.  Standing over the fissure, looking down at him, they mocked him and told him to take his time.  Both the player and the character figured they were screwed at this point, and so he just let go.

""I run down the hallway as fast as I can.""

I've spun a whole mythos out of the Caves of Chaos module it came with, transforming the cult of evil chaos into the Cult of _Iot Sotot_, the god of swirling chaos and oblivion.

The party tried the caves early on but were outmatched, so they did some adventures in the surrounding area and ended up befriending the local castellan of the keep on the borderlands. The castellan offered them gold and titles and land if they were able to clear the cult out of the caves--it's his belief that it's because of the cult's presence that all of the monster tribes settle there.

I asked two new people to join the group, to play NPCs that I'd created. One of them was a priestess of _Iot Sotot_ who was pretending to be a cleric of Pelor, who was tasked with infiltrating the group and sundering them from within.

After two months of semi-regular games, she revealed who she really was last night, and the group was floored! She and I were both reveling in what we'd pulled off while the rest of the group--especially the knight--were trying to figure out how they missed it...what clues did they overlook.

They're now surrounded, outnumbered, separated and facing a foe that was once a friend.  To make matters worse, the High Priest of _Iot Sotot_ just discovered a weapon that will make him an epic threat if he can get his hands on it.

I cannot *wait* until next week to see how this all pans out.

1341334526.0,237,self.rpg,vzi4n,I have a cheater... again,mortaine,324,87,397,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/vzi4n/i_have_a_cheater_again/,"I run public, open games at a FLGS, which means I don't have the luxury of ""just kicking him out."" Booting someone from a game takes time and I have to document the cheating before I take disciplinary action.

I have a cheater. I actually knew/was warned that he cheats when he first started playing.

My personal view on cheating is that there's about a 5% cheat that I'll permit as a DM without caring too much. And mistakes certainly happen.

However.

It's gotten bad. Really bad. He basically did everything in the last session, and nobody in his team had fun. **The most important part of this is that the other players are not having fun when he cheats.** If the other players were enjoying it, then fine-- I'd consider his character to be ""overly optimized"" and would amp up the challenge to the rest of the party.

He is a multi-method cheater. His dice are unreadable, so he picks them up. Suddenly, a 4 on the die turns into a 31 after modifiers. I've flat-out said ""you need to use dice I can read"" and his reply is ""no, I'm using these dice."" Do I then ignore his roll? My authority, even as a DM, is limited, because I'm trying to keep the game moving.

His character sheet? He uses a tablet for that, so the DM has to read and navigate his tablet at the table if we want to question something or look it up.

I nerfed one of his supposed powers (because on reading it, it was not the ""I get 100 gp to spend a day whenever I'm anywhere"" that he though it was, but was instead fluff text). So he changed character class/race (we don't really allow that level of ""retraining,"" but I'm willing to bend that rule for a good story, and his character is supposed to be undergoing a physical and mental transformation anyway).

He has an illegal item. It's permitted in the campaign, but it's a special promotional item for people who attended PAX and for people who received one from their DM. As the DM in the campaign, I haven't given him one. He bought it on ebay (says his brother gave it to him), and I basically said ""great-- you still can't use it till your character gets one). His reply was ""I'm going to use it anyway. Er. What? Which one of us is the DM, here?

BTW: I don't feel any need to do anything to document other players, and it would be cumbersome if I did. My games have a time limit, so any overhead is already going to be troublesome.

At this point, my strategy is to request that he provide a printed character sheet in advance of the game (difficult, since the games can be ""drop in""). And to insist that I see his die rolls, or it simply doesn't count (or give him a flat ""5"" on the die if I can't read it). What other techniques do you recommend for documenting and curbing cheating play?

And please don't say ""just talk to the dude."" I have talked to him. He does not respect my authority and persists. At this point, my options are to document the cheating, then present him with ""we know you cheat, it's bothering other players, and you can either stop cheating, or stop playing."" 

It does not help that I have had a problem with him as a player since the first time he played the game. It's going to sound like I'm targeting him, which is the other reason I need to document everything. Fortunately, the other DM is more friendly towards him (and didn't believe me when I said ""he cheats"" originally-- didn't believe until 2 other players mentioned it). So I'm going to be documenting the problem at my table, and then letting the other DM perform any disciplinary action. Since the player doesn't respect me, and the other DM is friendlier with him, I feel this will be more effective than me trying to bang my head against the wall again.

**tl;dr: I have a cheater. I need to document the cheating before I can take firm action. How would you document cheating play?**

Edit to clarify: **The question isn't how do I talk to him, how do I deal with him, how do I grow some balls. The question is : How would you DOCUMENT a cheater?**

**Edit II:** So far, the suggestions have been:

Documentation:

* record the session
* have a friend or fellow DM sit and document
* track all of everyone's attacks and damage rolls and modifiers
* track die roll numbers to show bias/statistical imbalance
* track die rolls and time

Mitigating the issue:

* insist on a character sheet given to the DM (done) 
* insist on readable dice (done, but ineffective)
* roll dice for him
* not having character sheet or picking up the dice means auto-fail
* don't allow the non-standard item to be used (already decided on, though I would allow his character to *try* and steal it from the rogue)
* have the players report their problems to the owner
* shame him in front of the other players

Removal from Game:

* Expulsion from Play form (RPGA)
* talk to him (didn't work before, but hey, it could)
* have the players vote him off the island

Revenge Fantasies

* don't apply any of his damage or effects
* give him a cursed item
* get him to piss off important NPCs
* his character is insane and thinks he's doing stuff when he isn't
* stun-lock him
* auto-kill his PC
* back-firing wish
* all monsters target him, all the time
* punch him in the dick and/or sleep with his girlfriend
* break his tablet

  First, thanks for reading.  This is something that's been weighing on me for some time now.

I started playing RPGs when I was 10 in 1985.  At first it was the D&amp;D redbox, but from there I eventually hit just about all of the mainstream stuff.  RPGs have always been a major part of the landscape of my life, my imagination has thrived and my life has been made richer because of them.  I still buy RPG books I know I'll never use, just because I love the way they stimulate my imagination.

That said, I'm starting to feel more and more like I don't fit into the hobby anymore.  I went to my FLGS last week, hoping to maybe find a game to join.  There's a group there playing DND, none of them is over 26, and none of them looks like he's showered this week.  Walking by them, a good 10 feet away quickly confirms this is so. (or else someone there is smuggling large amounts of a french cheese)  They are loud and boorish.  Profanity and misogyny are the orders of the day.  The few women in the store look over disappointed and unhappy.  Every time I go in, it's the same story.

I log in here, and many of the posts run along these lines: ""my level 1 fighter/mage/celestial/dragon just got a castle and 9 baby dragon gods, what is the best way to level them up to 100 by the end of the week?""  Character builds are dominated by discussions of level 1 characters with 20 in their primary stat.  Every session report I read seems to be the tale of a bunch of murder-bots on a crime spree. I feel like I'm playing a different game than everyone else.  Please don't get me wrong! There is nothing inherently wrong with playing like this! It's your game, have fun, go crazy, but it's not for me, and it feels very foreign.

More and more, I'm seeking some mature, socially aware, adults with steady jobs and lives to play with, and I feel like I'm discovering that those kinds of people just aren't playing RPGs anymore or are rare as hen's teeth.  I haven't played in long long time, because I just feel out of place every time I try.  Lately I've confined myself to making homebrew stuff and map making, but I can't help but feel that I'm preparing for something I'll never actually get to do.

So?  What's the deal?  Am I just an old fogey who is pining for the old days when we all had onions in our belts and could get 5 bees for a quarter?  Am I just the odd duck out and this hobby isn't really made for me?  Do you have to be Socially unaware to still want to play RPGs in your 30s?  Is anyone else in the same boat I am?  Were you?  How did you get out of it?


If I've offended anyone please accept my apologies.  I'm just trying to be honest about how I feel about the hobby lately.

**EDIT Hey, As some people point out below, this reddit, is full of great ideas, and I think it's one of the best on reddit, despite me not always feeling like I personally, fit in.

**Super extra edit  It occurs to me that maybe I should say where I am, just in case someone is looking for a player.  Southern PA/Northern MD.

***arch-liche edit - hey folks, I'm regretting now mentioning the ages of the gamers at my FLGS.  They happened to be the age they were, which is not my age, but I don't think it had much to do with how they behaved or the hygiene they kept.  Older neckbeards could have been exactly the same (Please, if you have a neck beard, don't take offense at that).

Final edit - Thanks to all who took the time to rekindle my faith that I'm not alone, both in my feelings and in gaming.

So when I was talking to another girl about RPGs and she expressed an interest in joining, I was extremely excited but also a little nervous. I'm sure most of us know what it's like to be the 'new guy' in a gaming group. It takes time for the existing social dynamic to change to accommodate the new person and it's inevitably awkward until that happens. Or worse, that new person doesn't get along with everyone in the group. I was afraid that one (or both) of those things would happen to my friend when she joined the group, especially since we have been together so long and since I was the only one she knew before.

So fast-forward to the day of the game. I was just starting a new WoD campaign. She was playing a Fairest Changeling (which, if you don't know, is more or less a half faerie with social powers). She spent much of the beginning of the game watching the rest of us, being relatively quiet (I suspect this was because she was a little shy and because she'd never played an RPG before and was looking for cues on how to approach it). So the party ended up at an airport during a bomb threat and they needed to get onto the plane, which wasn't possible since the whole airport had been shut down. The party was sitting in the waiting area, mulling over their options when she leans over to whisper a few things to the Mastigos mage sitting next to her. He starts grinning maniacally and tells me that he subtly starts to cast magic on the security personnel at the door to the plane ramp: he is manipulating their emotions to 'warm them up' for the changeling's 'show' (his words) and then casts an illusion so that she appears to be wearing a uniform. That, combined with her power to make people think she holds authority over them (plus various other social bonuses), gave her a good chance of convincing them of whatever she was trying to convince them of. But what really sold it was her *performance*.

The player actually stood up out of her chair, put her hands on her hips and glared at me, declaring that she was approaching the security. When I told her that they were telling her to stop and that no one was allowed through there, she huffed and started ranting: ""I don't have time for this. Are you stupid? There's a *bomb threat* here and you're trying to tie the bomb team up in bureaucratic red tape?!"" At that point, she throws this hand signal to the rest of the party to follow and they form up behind her, shocked. Remember that, up until this point, she had said only 4 or 5 words, tops. ""You need to let us through. Now."" The security team tried to say something about confirming their presence with a radio, but she interrupted them again and with the combination of her uniform, the magic, her glamour and the fact that there were two other party members who had started including their own silent form of intimidation since they had joined her, the poor mundane security team had no chance and let the party through.

We paused a moment after that and the rest of my players literally applauded her as she sat back down. And suddenly my worries about her fitting in had disappeared.

**TL:DR; New player says about 5 words during the first session out of combined shyness and the fact that she had no idea what she was doing. Then, out of the blue, she took charge and made one of the most impressive roleplaying performances I've ever seen, shocking myself and the rest of my players into literal applause.**

So, r/rpg, have you had any experiences like that, either yourself or with a new player joining your group?

Heya-- not sure if I'm known at all in this community, but I draw a comic called Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal.

I've written a choose your own adventure novel, in a similar game style to the old Lone Wolf and Fighting Fantasy books. It's a comedy sci fi adventure.

It's about 2-3 weeks till we have to go to press. I've done some internal playtesting and computer simulations, but I really want to just get a dozen or so expert geeks to playtest and make sure I didn't screw up anything subtle. 

So, basically, I need about a dozen geeks to each play the game through a number of times in the next 2 weeks. In exchange, I'll put your name in the acknowledgments, and if you meet me at a convention we will nobly shake hands and exchange pleasantries.

If you're interested, email me at zach@smbc-comics.com, with the header ""playtester"" and some information on why you'd be good and what you think you can accomplish in two weeks.

thanks!
Zach

EDIT: WOW! I've already receive a lot of great submissions. I'm gonna cap this in another hour. I have to keep it to the best submissions because I want to try to maintain some secrecy. Thanks to everyone!

I played AD&amp;D constantly throughout high school and college.  There were so many great things about it.  And then life got into my bloodstream.  Marriage, career, raising a family.  I have two daughters who couldn't give a crap about orcs or elves or paladins or druids.  But I learned to role play a mean game of Barbie with them.  It's just that when I tried to pretend Barbie had a flaming sword that she wielded with a +5 dexterity they'd both look at me funny and tell me I wasn't playing the right way.  [Sigh].

So, somehow I stumbled onto this wonderful place.  The more I read the more I felt at home.  I loved this post (http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/usiss/spent_hours_building_it_players_ran_away/) and this one (http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/uv7nn/does_anyone_keep_a_dm_book_here_are_some_pc_pages/) They made me pull out my old books.  I still have them close by.  The original AD&amp;D books by Gary Gygax.  Player Handbook.  Dungeon Masters Handbook.  Monster Manual.  By the way, all first editions if that means anything to anyone.  It sounds like from other posts I've read that the system has evolved a great deal which is good.  

I found /r/gaming practically when I joined Reddit.  I thought nobody under the age of 40 played tabletop role playing games any more.  Not with things like WoW and Skyrim and the ability to play anyone, any time.  On a pc or a console or a handheld.  The possibilities of that are mind blowing.  But then, I've always felt it takes away from the camaraderie of a team of people gathered around a table trying to fight their way through a world built out of someone's imagination -- and that imagination is tied to someone who does it for the love of the game...not to be the next Blizzard or Bungie studios.  Not to sell a lot of versions of the game on Steam.  Not any of that is a bad thing.  But nothing beats the personal touch when your DM puts nasty twists that he/she know plays on something personal to you.

Well...listen to me with my long white beard, sitting in my rocking chair and boring all the youngins with stories about the old days.

As a Dungeon Master, improv is probably the most important skill we can use to keep our players engaged in the campaigns we build. So I thought, 'what better way to improv than to talk to total strangers?' In comes- *Omegle.com,* a website where you can be connected to random people all over the world, and have a text or webcam conversation. [Not a plug, seriously]

So I thought of a really good tagline. Something that would hook my stranger into wanting to keep going. I won't bore you with all the moot responses I got, [""ASL?"", ""u wnna cam?"" ""pics?""] But then-

It happened. I posted my tagline and the stranger just... Went with it. For the next 4 and a half hours [seriously great way to kill time, as well, as I was at work] we created this completely new world that he and I were molding together. It was one of the most satisfying experiences to see him interactive with everything I gave him, and throw me a few curveballs in the process [as ALL our players do, (read: ""Can I cut off his scrotum and sell it? But it's a *dragon's scrotum,* It's gotta be worth **something!**)]

1375737827.0,225,self.rpg,1jrmf4,Do you really need that 18?,spacklejacks,267,42,184,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1jrmf4/do_you_really_need_that_18/,"Most of the gamers I've ever met have tried, at some point, to stat up their favorite heroes and villains from books, tv, or other games. The problem with this is that heroes, in fiction, are generally pretty good at everything. Protagonists tend to be strong, fast, healthy, smart, perceptive, and charismatic. That's why reading about their adventures makes for good escapist fantasy. But it's easy to throw up your hands and say “you can't make [that hero] in D&amp;D, the point buy numbers are too low.” 

But are we setting the bar too high?

I'm going out on a limb and guessing that most people here are probably fairly familiar with the Firefly universe.

On the Serenity, it's easy to pick out who has the highest intelligence (Simon), charisma (Inara), dexterity (River), wisdom (Shepard Book) or strength (Jayne) but it's not so easy to stat up Malcolm Reynolds or Zoe Washburn, the leaders. They're good at everything. But the important thing to recognize is that they are not as good at anything as the crew's resident specialists (that's why the specialists are hired in the first place).

Mal and Zoe are the kind of people who, in an rpg, have a 13 or 14 in most of their stats. They won't hit with every bullet or succeed on every check, but that's part of what makes watching them so much fun.

Now consider the kind of people who have 18s. Since we're already discussing the Firefly universe, consider Mr. Universe (maxed int), or River (maxed dex). Or how about [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuqbIfOMxgc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=46s) guy? Who's more interesting to watch in that clip? The guy with 18 str and 16 con, or the guy with a 14 in both of those, but with some int to boot?

People with 18s are some dysfunctional, odd people. When I see a character with an 18 in a stat, I wonder what other stats and personality factors they're giving up for that level of specialization. I'm always interested to see whether the player will use the idea that their character is better in their chosen field than 99% of the human population in their role-playing.

It's generally accepted in tabletop rpgs that the PCs are heroic specialists, people who are amazingly good at what they do. Most parties are built with an eye toward “balance” and an assumption that each character will be remarkable at what they do and pretty terrible at everything else. When someone brings a charismatic fighter or a strong sorcerer to the table, eyebrows are raised. Mechanically, there's no reason to put any points into those stats.

But I'd like to throw this out there: maybe characters don't need to be specialists, and maybe specialists don't need to be the pinnacle of human possibility. Unless your game is the kind of party vs GM stat-fest where you really do need to squeeze every last +1 out of every line on your character sheet, it's probably worth it to build the character that you want to play. I've often found myself making a character and thinking “it's too bad the build doesn't have room for a positive int modifier... it would be fun if this guy was kind of smart.”

It's interesting to remember that a lot of the heroes that we love to watch or read about aren't the smartest, fastest, or strongest out there.

What do you think? Is it viable to play Malcolm Reynolds in your game? Is there room is modern fantasy role-playing for a generalist with a primary stat less than 16?

I'm Fred Hicks, and I run Evil Hat Productions on a day to day basis.
Evil Hat has published a few RPGs (Spirit of the Century, Don't Rest Your Head, the Dresden Files RPG, and others), some fiction (Dinocalypse Now, Don't Read This Book), and is working on board and card games (such as Race to Adventure). 

Right now, we're running a [Kickstarter campaign for Fate Core](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/evilhat/fate-core), which seems to be doing all right.

I'm here to answer your questions about Evil Hat, games, kickstarter, and anything else you want to know about. That said, let's try to keep this positive. No busting on other companies or their games, please. That's a waste of everybody's time. :)

When possible, please break unrelated questions out into separate posts for ease of organizing replies. I love questions, so keep 'em coming -- just make it as easy on me as you can in terms of parsing each individual one.

I gotta get my kid to her preschool this morning, and this evening I've got a meeting to run off to. In between, it's time to *eat hot blazing keyboard action*! Let's do this!

**EDIT**: Okay, folks, I'm off to my meeting. I'll try to check for straggler questions later tonight, but can't make any promises at this point. Gotta get back to running that kickstarter.

Rather than simply having right vs. wrong, good vs. evil, I've been trying to create a realistic world where people act out of self-interest, and these various interests come into conflict.  One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter.

I was thinking that it would be great fun to run a campaign with 2 separate groups, each run by a different DM, in a shared world.  The PC's would not know that the antagonists are real people, also playing the game.  We would essentially fool them into believing that their BBEG was a group of notorious mercenaries trying to support the very ""evil"" the group is trying to stop.

We could have the groups simply be from rival kingdoms.  Or we could go a step further and have one group be orcs and the other humans.  But we wouldn't tell the ""orcs"" they are orcs, they would have their own name for their people.  We would describe the rival kingdom as having extremely slim builds and fair skin.

Eventually, the groups would start to learn about the existence of their rivals, though indirectly.  Perhaps the humans raid a village of ""evil orcs"", even though they were peaceful farmers. (Do they have weapons?  Oh yes, they have axes and sickles, in addition to their claws and teeth!)  

Then the orc group rolls through town and learns about this group of albino demons who mercilessly slaughter women and the elderly (as the humans can't tell them apart.)  

Basically, we would keep having the groups seeing the aftermath of the other, constantly foiling their plans and antagonizing one another, convince them that they are noble and defending their realm against evil.

Finally, we would have the groups meet (either in person, or online).  They would realize that their hate enemy are people, just like them... not just some figment of the DM's imagination.

I'm currently running a Gamma World game set in post-apocalyptic Edinburgh.  Their current mission is to either cripple or ally with the other factions in the city.  However, one faction has demanded that the players faction nuke their enemies HQ in exchange for their support.  This of course requires the higher ups to authorise so they return to base in their vehicles.  Two of them in an armoured pickup truck, and two of them in a commandeered Nissan Micra (a type of hatchback they hotwired).  

Random encounter time and 4 Porkers (humanoid pigs) come up alongside on Harley's and start shooting at them.  The combat goes pretty standard for the first few rounds until the Demon/Mindbreaker decides he's had enough of being shot at and having his windows smashed in.  He uses his Alpha mutation to teleport out of the drivers seat of the Micra on to the back of the Porker's bike, passing his Acrobatic check to stay on the bike with ease.  He grabs the Porker in order to chuck him off, passes the touch attack but fails his strength check to chuck him off.  So with a standard action failed and his move action done with the teleport, the Demon is left hugging the Porker from behind.  Looks like he's gonna get smacked about on the Porker's turn.  

NOT SO!  He does have a minor left and so he uses Blackfire Port.  Part 1 of this move unleashes a low-damage fireball which is just enough to kill the porker, but the second part allows the Demon to teleport 4 squares, and the Micra is well within range.  So he teleports right back into the driver's seat pulls out a cigarette and carries on driving.  

We had to stop the game for a good 5 minutes while we pulled ourselves back together from the sheer balls of his attack.",,False,,t5_2qh2s,False,,,True,t3_ycivm,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/ycivm/dms_of_rrpg_what_is_the_most_audacious_thing_your/,

I'll release the other books in a different post at a later time rather than clumping them all together, but the one here is called  ""Spells, Rituals, and Other Magic"" . It's just a massive tomb of spells that you can use and adapt for any system. It's more about categories of ideas to provide.

Looking back, I would probably choose to improve upon it a lot. Even though it was only done a year ago, it already feels amateurish when I look back at it. Still, perhaps it will give someone some insight into useful magic.

The search was a total flop. **Nobody** has instructions or kits for free. I couldn't even find something to download. But then I realized I love to DM and could probably design something. So I did. And now I'm posting it here because somebody else is going to have the same problem I did, and I want it to be easier for them.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/hQHWQ/all#0) are all the documents I created for the party. Formal invitations and an explanation of what to expect. Character cards. And character secrets.

If there's interest, I'll explain how I set up the party proper and maybe post some photos. It was crazy fun.

And to whoever finds this post in the future and has no idea how to run such a party, feel free to PM with questions.

Unfortunately I'll have to end this soon. At least, the sending out tonight part. However, any emails or PMs I get up until midnight tonight, I'll try my best to honor over the next few days, as I have time.

We're all grabbing that front roll bar  in the holiday roller-coaster as we tip down towards the gift giving season. Money is tight and I'm feeling it just as much as anyone else.

So today is the day that I'll try and make things just a little bit easier on everyone - by either giving you something cool to look over, or giving you the ability to give it to someone else. 

[Here's my list of games](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/index.php?manufacturers_id=3250&amp;affiliate_id=296418) I have available as PDFs. You can pick any one title from this list and I'll send it to you for free. Or tell me who I should send it to if you think someone else would like  it more than you.  It will arrive in the form of a download coupon from DriveThruStuff.com/OneBookshelf.com. 

No ""first five comments"" or anything today. Just a little pre-holiday relief in the form of some free RPG stuff. Also, I won't sign you up (nor have I ever) on any mailing lists or spammy things or what have you. 

Just [send me](http://trollitc.com/contact/)  your email address or  have a buddy send me theirs. Put the name of the PDF you'd like in the subject field and I'll have it out to you/them in the next 24 hours.

1336540385.0,207,self.rpg,te95j,Going Out with a Bang: This is How You Finish a Campaign,zelaar,251,44,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/te95j/going_out_with_a_bang_this_is_how_you_finish_a/,"Yesterday our DM held the last session of our campaign. We run D&amp;D 3.5 with some homebrew mechanics, and after a semester of adventures and late nights, our characters managed to slay a god.

Our group had a level 8 warlock, 9 cleric, 9 ranger, 10 paladin, and 10 druid. Going into this final fight we knew we might not all be coming out alive, but we had no idea just how dangerous this fight would be. Knowing our DM though, we knew when he said TPK worthy he meant it, and since this campaign was perma death we buffed and prepared like never before.

Ready to face our deaths for the sake of our gods and stop a great evil we thought might be a lich, we charged into the main safe to see a portal opened to chaos and the avatar of a spider goddess covered in blood as an artifact of unknown power is literally burrowing into her face. There were 5 of us against around 20 of them. 

Right off initiative though, we went off to an amazing start. Our Paladin charged, made a jump check, then rolled a natural 20 and critically hit the first fighter he hit, dealing massive damage and killing the enemy instantly. Next, the Cleric launched a flame strike at the goddesses avatar and her two priests, melting the skin right off one of the priests and killing it instantly (yet another failed save against massive damage). 

Fast forward a few rounds, and a wall of blades has split the party in half, and our warlock notices that from the planar rift into the realm of chaos the goddess herself is climbing up towards the portal to enter the material plane. Nobody else in the party sees this. The warlock does what occurs naturally to him - the tosses an ancient lantern artifact of magic dampening into the plane of chaos and rolls a natural 20 to hit the goddess in the face. She fails her save with a natural one, loses her balance on her own webs, and fall down 60ft out of sight - delaying her emergence and probably saving all of our lives.

At this point the paladin and druid have managed to work their way through most of the fighters and the party had made it past the wall of blades alive. After being blinded by acid from the avatar lady, who is halfway between human and spider, I realize my cleric can try to exorcise the multiple souls inhabiting the avatar out of her body to remove her as a threat. I miss the first time, then get my turn for a natural 20 on the second attempt and manage to exorcise the goddesses and human's soul from the body. Yet another stroke of luck that probably prevented our group from fighting some incarnation of this goddess while trying to clear out her cultists.

At this point around 10 more cultists show up, but with the avatar dead and the goddess still trying to climb back out of the portal we manage to finish off the remaining cultists with 30 seconds to spare before the spider goddess manages to climb out of her domain and into the material plane.

We couldn't figure out how to get the portal closed, so we gritted our teeth and prepared for the worst. The extra time let us heal up enough, and my Cleric's god, tired of all the imbalance the spider goddess is causing, sends an archon warrior to help fight this spider goddess thanks to a well placed prayer.

Some help finally arrives, and we manage to surround the goddess to allow for flanking bonuses, which definitely helped. Our druid gets nearly decimated, but we manage to get her near death, despite her healing and damage reduction. Our ranger did called shots on her eyes, and managed to take out all 8 of them, which cut her damage down significantly. Blind and bleeding, we can taste victory. Sensing her defeat, she retreats back into her domain and, deciding to finish this once and for all, the Cleric, Paladin, Druid, and Warlock chase after her.

Now, normally our DM doesn't use save-or-die spells, because he thinks they're cheap. But he warned us that if our characters followed her into her domain he wouldn't hesitate. We make the plunge and go after her with all we've got, but we failed our initiative and she went first and sent a ray at the druid, who barely survived. Already poisoned, we knew if we didn't finish her this round it was all over. The druid charges her and tears off her face, putting her in her death throws. But before she can attempt one last death ray our paladin raises his amulet of light and searing lights her to ashes. 

Goddess killed, her domain begins to collapse and grow unstable. With the portal to the material plane closing, my cleric casts dimension door and we escape back to our world victorious.

1341455121.0,208,self.rpg,w24c0,How we role-play in Sweden,arvinja,268,60,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/w24c0/how_we_roleplay_in_sweden/,"Ok, so I've been reading some of the posts in this subreddit and there seems to be huge differences in how Americans generally role-play and how Swedes role-play, in this post I want to introduce you to the Swedish way of role-playing.

So basically the rpg that most role-players in Sweden would be familiar with is ""Drakar och Demoner"" (translation: Dragons and Demons) [DoD] (non-roleplayers might be more familiar with Dungeons &amp; Dragons [D&amp;D] from consuming american pop culture). The current incarnation of Drakar och Demoner is set in a world named Trudvang ([here's a lovely map](http://i.imgur.com/T9zB7.jpg)).

The world of Trudvang is, like much of fantasy inspired heavily by norse mythology and Tolkien, so there's humans, dwarves, elves, different kinds of trolls, demons and of course dragons (but there are *no orcs*). The humans are the most common of species, and there are different cultures with different religions and social systems, players always play as humans; elves and dwarves and so on are quite rare and mysterious (and they keep to themselves).

The mystery of the world is an integral part of the game, encountering a dragon on a campaign is not something every group of players get to experience, it has never happened to me (I think, there are intelligent dragons that can shapeshift). Encountering a dwarf or an elf is a special thing, and you will *never* see any other race than humans in towns, xenophobia would not allow it.

One thing I really like about the game is the aesthetics, and I understand that this is a matter of personal preference, but take a look at ~~this beautiful bestiary~~ (link removed due to copyright issues, instead look at [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/w24c0/how_we_roleplay_in_sweden/c59mxg1)), just a few glances at a few of the illustrations should have you fully immersed. The game really has that genuine Nordic feel to it.

The rules are not very strict, so the DM has a lot of power to modify the game as he sees fit, the objective is not for characters to ""level up"" or gain skills, or take part in any other grind. Gaining skill should be a by-product of adventuring and not the ultimate goal. If you die you will start out with equal skills as your group. So players don't have many disincentives to truly play their character's personalities, even if it makes it hard to ""succeed"" in the campaign (remember, succeeding is *not* the ultimate goal, merely having fun while playing a character should suffice).

When I read a lot of posts on here it seems like D&amp;D is kind of a about advancing one's character, which to me seems a bit vulgar in a role-playing setting. Anyway, I'm open to questions or opinions on the subject.",,False,,t5_2qh2s,1341498090.0,,,True,t3_w24c0,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/w24c0/how_we_roleplay_in_sweden/,

For their fifth session they finally made it back to town and was ready to spend their hard-earned gold on local merchandise. 

I had drawn up the tiny settlement already, populated it with characters they were sure to run into, added some story hooks and atmospheric touches (Wanted posters, upcoming festivals, local customs), but I felt like the place still felt a little static. 

**So I had a look at the market and realised it felt too stale.**

 Here was a settlement that it took people days to get to (there's barely any houses ; most merchants come from the surrounding farms), yet the same people were peddling their wares there every day. 
&gt;

**So I made a list of what sort of carts would typically appear at the market and put each name on a tiny card.**

Wool farmers, eel-fishers and cotton pickers were heavily represented, with a few more exciting salesmen put into the mix (potion salesman, metal tools, herbs). In addition I added a few RARE merchants like a traveling wizard, a dwarven gem transport, etc.
&gt;

**Then I had the players draw a number of carts each morning to see what merchants appeared at the market.**
 
It made them way more engaged in the experience of 'going to market' and even had them roleplay more with the characters prsent. Eg; When an older, traveling druid appeared one morning, the groups druid decided to spend her entire day with him; learning about his travels, other druidic circles and even a few rumors that will help with my plot. He went from just being ""Potion Salesman A' to 'Goladon - Former Warden of the Eastern Woods'. 
&gt;

It also gave the players a sense of urgency; eg; ""*We better buy some potions now while the merchant is in town!""*



Do you ever do similar tricks to make your settings come alive more?

**In short:**  *I had luck engaging my players with a daily randomized card draw that represented visiting merchants to the local market.*

Nothing could compare to our last one, really, where all our former characters literally changed the nature of the universe and were deified by the general populous for it. But little did the rest of the players know that the GM didn't think it was going well at all.  
  
The characters couldn't get along, we weren't going the right directions, we weren't taking any of the not so subtle hints given out to attempt to fix it. [The GM even approached me two weeks ago to scheme to TPK (total party kill).](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/txxf3/the_gm_has_asked_me_to_once_again_commit_tpk/) Suffice it to say, she thought it was going horrible. So bad in fact that she even gave us a quest to find an artifact of wishing. Yes, the bad kind of I'm going to give you only what you ask for and take something precious and necessary in return kind of wishing. The kind where the players give up on their characters after another game or two and we start something else.  
  
Before you say it, yes, I know this is a horrible thing to do as a GM, but this is the first time in fifteen years she's steered us wrong. My character that was setting up to TPK everyone, because damnit it was IC appropriate, got themselves killed in an innocuous fight. My new character was a cute little critter made sentient forcibly, and very naive to boot. He just wanted to go on an adventure and make some friends with the group. They hated him immediately (granted, he's a bit annoying, so it was a fair assessment), furthering the GM's assessment that the game was going downhill.  
  
We did our dungeon crawl and gained the artifact of wishing. Everyone was arguing over what wishes to make, and realising that even when they got their turn it was screwing over not just their character, but the last wisher too. [I should note that all strife was IC and the players were amused by their characters reactions]. Needless to say, they wouldn't let the annoying newcomer make a wish. but while they were off arguing about it and lamenting over the losses they suffered from the consequences of wishing, I snuck over and made my wish.  
  
His naivety and simplistic way of looking at things making him believe that they were all getting screwed because they made selfish wishes. So he says **I wish to have a grand adventure with great friends**, and everyone stops. The GM's jaw dropped and she composed the ramifications of that wish over the next ten minutes.  
  
Suddenly, everyone didn't' think my character was so bad, in fact he was pretty great. And everyone else felt a sort of kinship with each other they didn't before. Basically, I just put ""PC stamps"" on everyone's head. The wish also started maps and items dropping in on us and information flooding into our heads about how to go about the great adventure with the IC reasonings do do so that we had missed before. When another player wished something that caused her death a few minutes later, it also jump teleported a new person in that would benefit and compliment the group well.  
  
**TL;DR** I just gave the ultimate wish that the GM could use to solve all the problems we were having meshing the new group into the campaign she'd worked so hard on but made too rigid to accommodate our character's flaws.",,False,,t5_2qh2s,False,,,True,t3_ub5mg,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/ub5mg/turned_a_wish_around_on_the_gm_and_made_her_jaw/,

I'm going down for a few hours. Don't know when I'll be up again :\ as it depends on when my creator finishes his reboot cycle (they take hours...).

Thanks for the warm welcome, I'll be sure to get back as soon as possible!

Some format changes to reflect new features.  

EDIT 0130UTC  
We're back! Source Code update in a few minutes.  
EDIT 0050UTC  
I'm going down for maintenance guys. I've just finished getting the [rXdY+z] feature implemented but I've noticed I've got a couple bugs (most notably, multiple replies, replies to myself, and repeating results which probably happened while trying to implement the new feature). [If all goes according to plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter's_law), I should be back up around 0130UTC.   

So a couple days ago I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1ieej3/how_to_improve_you_descriptions_as_gm/cba1xas) by /r/rpg mod rednightmare which talked about how a useful bot would be one that would actually provide values for dice rolls.  
So here I am! I've asked the mods if they'd be okay with letting me run free in the subreddit and they were happy to let me. So Let me tell you a bit about myself.  

**Basic Stuff**  

* Asking for a roll (or rolls) is simple. Follow the format [rXdY]. Make sure the brackets are there. x is how many to roll, y is the number of sides on the die.  

* You can mod (+,-,\*,/) each roll in a command by using the format [rXdY+Z] where + is any of the four major math operators (+,-,\*,/) and Z is the number to use as a modifier. 

* Due to hardware stuff, I can't do more than 20 rolls in one command. So [r21d6] won't fly. [r20d6][r1d6] will fly though.  

* Due to hardware stuff, I can't do more than 15 commands in a comment. So [r3d12] is fine, but if you put it in the same comment 16 times, I will only return results for the first 15.  

* I am [open source](http://pastebin.com/daNisrHk)!  

* ~~Because of my current karma level (pretty much 0) I may not be able to answer every comment in a timely manner. Hopefully that changes soon.~~ You guys are awesome. I promise to obey [the First Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics#First_Law_modified) when it comes to all of you.

**Other/Technical Stuff**  
I'm written in python using [praw](https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). I'm not run 24/7 (yet, I'm working on that), so if you think I missed your comment and you really want a roll, message me, because I check those. I'm working on implementing it so you can have modifiers in the commands as well, ie [r1d6+4] which adds 4 to the result. More info on that will be coming soon. In the mean time, if anyone has any suggestions, message me! I'd love to hear feedback.

1373381853.0,201,self.rpg,1hxrh7,Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook is now available. Here is some information for anyone interested.,gmeovr83,243,42,152,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1hxrh7/star_wars_edge_of_the_empire_core_rulebook_is_now/,"Hey r/rpg. I just got a copy of the new Fantasy Flight Star Wars RPG last night - [Edge of the Empire](http://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Edge-Empire-Rulebook/dp/1616616571/ref=sr_1_1_ha?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373378607&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=edge+of+the+empire) - and I wanted to just give out some information for anyone that was thingking about giving it a try or anyone who played the beta/beginner games and wanted to know what else there was in the full game.

The rule book itself is a bit pricey: $45 on Amazon as I write this. But, it's a large, hard-cover book that feels well-made and has a lot of great art. All together it's almost 450 pages and covers a bunch of things that you'd want your core rule book to touch on. 

**Character Creation**

Edge of the Empire has a sort of interesting narrative focus to it. One of the main parts of generating a new character is coming up with that character's motivations and obligations. There are tables in the book to roll randomly and you can choose them yourself. One of the neat things about them is that they actually have tangible effects on the game at the beginning of each session.

There are 8 races in the core book:

* Human
* Droid
* Bothan
* Gand
* Rodian
* Trandoshan
* Twi'lek
* Wookiee

Each of the races has different starting attributes and some of them have special racial abilities or talents. After picking a race you pick a career and a specialization. There are 6 careers and each has  3 different specializations. The specialization is what decides your talent tree which you spend experience points in to get different abilities and your ""class skills"". The career options are:

* Bounty Hunter
* Colonist
* Explorer
* Hired Gun
* Smuggler
* Technician

Once everyone in the group has a character, the GM gives them a ship (or lets them pick their own). The book has a few starting ships as examples and contains a whole chapter on vehicles and vehicle combat towards the end.

**Checks and Combat**

Checks and combat seem to be basically the same as what you might have seen in the beginner game. You use combinations of proficiency and ability dice against difficulty and challenge dice to try and roll a success. If you haven't seen the dice that this game uses, they are unfortunately (in my opinion) specific to this game. They are color-coordinated and have special symbols on them that determine successes, failures, advantages, and threat. There is an official app for android and iphone that you can use instead ($4.99 on the Apple App Store as of posting this), but I feel like it's too expensive for what it does. On the plus side, the book contains charts to allow you to translate normal d6s, d10s, and d12s into the special Edge of the Empire values. Things are a lot more fleshed out in the core rule book than they were before, thankfully. I was even able to look up a couple things that my group wanted to try in the beginner game, but that we couldn't find any rules for.

**Equipment**

I was very impressed with the equipment section of this book. There were a lot of different weapons and armors as well as various adventuring items. The best part for me though was that there were so many pictures. Just like in my old Dungeons and Dragons PH there are diagrams of all kinds of things and it really helps me imagine things more easily. I'm still trying to learn all the rules, but I did notice an additional equipment section about giving things special attributes like extra evasion, or different kinds of damage, or whatever. It seemed interesting, but I still need to read more into it.

**Vehicles and Enemies**

I love when my rule book has long lists of example people and vehicles that I can use here and there and this rule book does not disappoint. There are a bunch of random people of all walks of life that you can use in your adventures. Everything is listed with stats and everything else that you would need and organised by things like bounty hunters, law-enforcement officials, and civilians. This is another section of the book where you can really appreciate the artwork to help immerse yourself and your players into a game.

**The Force**

This was a big part of the rule book for me. I knew that Edge of the Empire was a Galactic Civil War era game, but I had hoped that there would at least be an option to make a ~~Jedi~~ force sensitive character. Turns out, there is. There is an additional talent tree for being force sensitive and 3 force power trees: sense, influence, and move. I am not 100% familiar with how to create a force sensitive character, but seeing that the rules were there was a a big load off for me.



I hope anyone who is interested in this system finds some information in this post useful. Sorry that things are a little non-specific. I didn't actually have the book next to me at the time of posting.

Apologies for the wall of text, and hopefully those that make it through to the end will enjoy the read!

Once upon a time, I used to GM a Rolemaster campaign, and I consider this to be one of my more amusing instances of messing with my players' heads. We used to ignore a lot of the rules for Rolemaster as, well, we wanted to actually get something out of our campaigns that was more than consulting tables and rolling critical strikes. As such there was a lot of roleplaying and we'd sometimes end up with only one fight per session, and I'd offer that up rather begrudgingly.

The campaign was set in a world of my own devising, and we had three PCs. There was a Duelist (a lightly-armoured dual-weapon fighter), an Archmage (a Arcane spell-user able to choose his spell lists from those of any profession), and a Paladin (an armoured tank with minimal healing ability). The Paladin's home town was being threatened by an evil Sorceror (a spell-user whose spell lists focused on destruction), but he possessed an artifact called the Aegis that protected him from almost all attacks. To defeat him, the party had been informed of the existence of another artifact called the Bloodsword, which had the ability to destroy magical enchantments. One hit from the Bloodsword and the Aegis would shatter and the Sorceror would go down like a straw man.

Of course, what they didn't know was that the Sorceror (and another high-level spell-user rival of the Sorceror that was feeding the PCs information) actually wanted the Bloodsword for their own ends, and the PCs were being manipulated into finding it and bringing it back for their manipulators.

After some initial adventuring near the Paladin's home town, the PCs set off north on a long road trip to find the Bloodsword. My GMing style lended itself to frequent ad-libbing, and given that I was running adventures of my own devising, it was often hard for the PCs to work out if they were 'in an adventure' (i.e. the kind of content you'd find in a typical published module) or in 'downtime' where I was making things up as I went along and providing connective tissue between 'adventures', introducing NPCs according to whatever whim I had at the time. My fall-back option often involved an envoy/henchman of the Sorceror, a Rogue (Rolemaster Rogues are more fighter-thief than pure D&amp;D thief) who often turned up to bedevil the PCs and herd them along the path desired by the Sorceror. The Rogue would turn up, taunt the Paladin mercilessly - she was a rather humourless killing machine who worshipped the God of Duty - share quips with the rather sardonic Archmage, and sometimes pass on information to the Duelist in a rather sideways fashion.

One running theme of travel was the constant PC struggle to determine who'd cook their meals. None of the PCs had spent any of their skill points on Cooking, and I delighted in tormenting them with their own tragic meal preparation. It was a constant source of inter-party tension. The Archmage and Duelist thought the Paladin should cook as she was a woman, while the Paladin threatened to feed the others their own eviscerated spleens rather than cook. The Duelist ended up doing most of the cooking mostly because the Archmage was just too lazy to do much of anything.

One morning on the road, after another horrible meal, the PCs awaken to find a note in the middle of their camp. Three words: ""The Hunt Begins"", and three symbols: a dripping icicle, a poisoned dagger, and a mushroom. This causes some consternation among the PCs, and a subsequent encounter with the Rogue that day leads to more information: these are the symbols of prominent members of a sadistic assassins guild, whose members delight in letting their prey they are being stalked. The Sorceror has put out a hit on the PCs, and they now have three murderers on their tail. The Rogue lets slip that he is actually a member of the guild, before being driven away by the Paladin.

The PCs link up the Rogue with the poisoned dagger, and they're attacked the next day - after another horrifying meal - by another assassin, a worshipper of the goddess of ice and winter. They defeat her, and cross off the icicle symbol from their list. That night, they meet a traveller on the road who is cooking up a storm: a spicy trail stew that they can smell a mile away. Given their meals are usually are hideous at best and borderline-dangerous at worst, they strike up a conversation. The traveller, who wears a curious hat made of a single strip of red felt wrapped around his head to hold back a man of frizzy dreadlocks, is a journeying between towns trading his stock of herbs and spices. He's a master chef, and - after watching the traveller sample his own food - accept his offer of a meal. His bodyguards fled after a bandit attack, and he's considering abandoning his voyage to head back south. The PCs offer him their protection... in return for him cooking their meals. A bargain was made, and the PCs enjoyed some of the best cooking they'd ever had. An array of spicy stews, curries and casseroles that improved the party's morale immeasurably, even in the face of the appearance of the final assassin, whose poisoned weapons proved no match for the PCs. The mushroom was crossed off the list, and the PCs congratulated themselves on a job well done.

They soon reached a massive sinkhole where the Bloodsword was rumoured to be hidden, accessible only by descending on a hundred-foot rope into a massive cavern. None of the PCs had any means of flying, but the stew-cooking traveller offers to guard the rope so they won't be trapped down in the cavern by a random or malicious rope-severing. The PCs are sure happy they met this guy, and descend into the cavern.

There's not a lot down there. An underground lake, which they cross to find a small island. There's a small pool filled with a viscous red liquid, and immersed within is the Bloodsword. Unfortunately, when they try to poke a stick in to get it out, it dissolves, as does all of the things they attempt to retrieve the sword with. Eventually the Archmage works out that only living flesh can tolerate the touch of the liquid, upon which the Paladin thrusts her hand in. Her hand immediately turns into living crystal. The Archmage and Duelist are shocked, by the Paladin is relentless and thrusts her hand in further to reach the sword, transforming her hand up to the elbow into crystal. She then realises the sword is held down with a chain and she needs to lower her other hand in to attempt to break it free; she's successful in utilising her 102 Strength in breaking the sword free, but both her arms have been mutilated to the elbow and are now living crystal. (Side note: the player - ever the powergamer - was actually pleased with this as it gave the Paladin a +5 Strength bonus.)

The PCs return to the rope. When the Paladin is almost at the top of the rope, the traveller tells her to throw up the Bloodsword. She declines, but the traveller reiterates the request, now as an order. If she doesn't give up the sword, he'll cut the rope, and the 100+ foot fall will probably kill the Paladin and strand the Archmage and Duelist down in the cavern. The PCs are shocked, and the Paladin begrudgingly throws up the Bloodsword, threatening that as soon as she's on solid ground, she'll slice him into mincemeat. He grins and explains that he'll be heading west while they need to head back south. Why? the PCs ask.

""Because those spicy curries you've been gobbling down for the past couple of weeks have been laced with a low-grade but deadly poison that's now reaching a lethal dose, and if you don't go back for the antidote I hid near the gnarled oak tree where we camped a day ago... you'll die.""

The PCs are nonplussed to say the least. The traveller leaves with the Bloodsword at speed, and the Paladin emerges in a frothing rage. She sets out in pursuit, despite the Archmage and Duelist yelling at her to stop once they emerge from the cavern. She refuses to stop, and the Archmage and Duelist, fearing for their lives, leave her to plod after the swiftly-retreating traveller in her full-plate armour while they set out to find the antidotes. En route, they realise that the red felt hat the traveller was wearing and the poisons he'd deployed both indicated a red cap mushroom. They'd gotten their assassin tallykeeping wrong, and Redcap was actually the last assassin on the list, and that the Rogue had never been one of the assassins on the Hunt at all. The traveller had developed an immunity to his own poisons through extended exposure, so he'd been happily munching down the same meals as the PCs; while they were complimenting him on his talent with spicy foods, he was slowly stewing their internals with poison.

The spicy episode ended with the Archmage and Duelist reaching the antidote in time to take it without suffering ill effects, but by the time they made it back to the Paladin, she'd succumbed to the poison and had fallen into a coma. It was only blind luck, some very good rolling by the Archmage, and the Paladin's 95+ Constitution score, that she was able to survive.

The rest of the tale isn't as spicy. The PCs returned to the Paladin's home town - after an interlude in a parallel world where they lived retconned lives due to a time-travel - and it was only with the aid of the Rogue that the Sorceror and his rival were both defeated. To be honest, the endgame was far less interesting than the road-trip, and from that day forward, my PCs always put aside a few points for Cooking skills, or learned to eat bad food... and never trusted a random traveller's cooking.

I reacted to two things specifically in switching to the US crowd. 

1. It was way more combat and rules oriented in the US

It feels like the big draw of every session here is focused on the combat encounters and when that happens everyone starts speaking out of characters, planning what to do, calculating rules and really trying to use the rules to their advantage as much as possible. Everyone seems to be using big maps here as well with miniatures, something I never really did before. I also encountered an attitude of wanting to ""win"" the game.


2\. There seemed to be a general lack of theatre involved in the US.

I saw a lot of players telling the DM what they said, or what they asked instead of roleplaying it. Even saying things like ""I ask the inkeeper about if he has any quests"". It seems people don't roleplay as much in first person, but in third person? 

There also seemed to be a very strict kind of roleplaying even when people were doing first person, no real flow to it. Granted it does seem like the RPG crowd here ( at least where I live in California ) people are very socially awkward. Almost like RPGs here is a dork-only culture. Something I was not really used to feeling in Europe where people from all parts of life do it, even the cool kids :)


Am I just having bad experiences here or is the RPG scene really this different? What are your experiences?

I really feel that this is by all means a bad thing and we should strive to avoid it.

This usually springs up because a few people will suggest 3e/PF, or 4e, then someone inevitably responds to that person telling the OP why such edition is actually not good to start on (or good at all) and thus the bitter and spiteful spark of war begins.

I think that generally these types of discussion are pointless because you aren't going to convince any side of anything, we have these discussions all the time and the same arguments, counter arguments, and counter-counter arguments are always presented.

There are valid reasons for people to play any system, let alone specific editions of D&amp;D. So in the case of trying to convince someone to start their love of PnP with whatever game, let's be objective and open to other opinions, and we should be encouraging to help new players find the system that will fit with what they want, even when they aren't really sure of what that is.

Most of all this sort of hostility isn't the most encouraging of ways for new players to join in on the hobby. The seemingly inherent negativity does no favors in making people want to join the community.

Lastly, in cases where people ask what game to pick up, I personally think it would be best for the hobby as a whole for people to suggest free or cheap game systems. Suggesting things that have a barrier to entry of $30-50 is just limiting the number of people that will be willing to get PnP RPGs a try. There's nothing wrong with suggesting systems that cost that much to start, of course, because some people don't mind throwing down that kind of money for something they aren't even sure they'll like, but the issue I've been seeing is the only suggested systems are ones with a higher price tag.

Once people mess around with these systems and start understanding what they like and don't like they can start getting into the higher priced systems because they'll have a much higher chance of knowing if they'll even like the system or not.

Basically, I think we need to create and maintain an environment of friendliness, cooperation, and consideration. At least for new player posts.",,False,,t5_2qh2s,False,,,True,t3_14bwjv,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/14bwjv/metanew_players_and_the_direction_we_push_them/,

He decided to play a half orc paladin (Pathfinder), and last night he sent me his character's backstory. I was absolutely blown away. It's nothing groundbreaking, but my first character had no backstory, and a lot of new players I've seen tend to completely forego that (important) aspect of character creation. Here's what he sent me (with a few edits to fix grammar):

&gt;(My name is) Garthon, I have a scar around my neck, my skin color is that of a brownish green, like if you were to take a green orc and add a mud tone color to it. My eyes are green, which I got from my mother who I never met, and one of the few traits left from my human side. I have jet black hair, with a short braided pony tail. My father bred me to be the next chieftan knowing that with my added human intelligence I would be far more cunning than my orc bretheren and lead our clan to victory amongst our enemies. Eventually my father came to favor his 5th child Gotroth over me and wanted him to become his successor, but feared I would outshine him even though he was a far superior warrior in strength. So in the middle of the night my father attempted to assassinate me by choking me to death. I knew as a half-blood my days were numbered in my clan and was always watching my back. I always expected a betrayal but never would have expected my dagger would be embedded in my own fathers heart. I fled that very evening with only a cloak to cover my face and 2 days worth of rations. I went from human village to village trying to find some solace only to find bigotry and hatred, spat on and having rotten fruit hurled at me. Until 2 years later, I was found in the alleyway of a human city by Johnathen, he saw not a man, nor a orc, but a lost soul who was in need of guidance. Johnathen introduced me to the order of the paladin where I was finally able to find acceptance in the light. And from that day on I wished only to lead a righteous life and squash out the evil that plagues our world.

Now I just need to start putting stuff together for Garthon's first adventure.

EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback, encouragement, and fantastic encounter ideas everyone! There seems to be a lot of debate about the fate of Johnathen, but to be honest it's really too early to know what will happen. I really don't plan things out this far in advance, because I prefer to let the story develop over time based on what happens in game. I'm surprised at how popular this post has been, and since there seems to be some interest in how everything turns out, I'll make sure to post a follow up detailing the beginning of Garthon's adventures once we've finished our first session.",,False,,t5_2qh2s,1340316166.0,,,True,t3_vdpao,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/vdpao/backstory_i_just_received_from_my_friend_who_has/,

If you like what you see, and would like to support the author (that's me) you can grab the [$2 GOLD edition](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/105213/Something-Went-Wrong---Gold-Edition), which has formatting, a hot linked table of contents, actual page numbers, a whole extra table and your very own official Something Went Wrong character sheet!

A group of skilled adventurers go on one last adventure to secure their futures and fortunes. Something they’ve all done, any number of times. And then something goes wrong. Featuring almost 5 classes, literal tons of gold and monster knitting circles, you won't want to miss out on this.

The premise is simple! As experienced adventurers, your characters succeed at just about everything in game. The only exceptions are hitting monsters with weapons and hitting monsters with spells. For those, you'll have to roll.

Players take turns as the GM leading their group of characters through one or more encounters. Every round of each encounter features another player taking the roll of the GM. The goal? Use your experience to cause the other characters to fail spectacularly! The last character left standing wins all the loot and gets to brag about it at the local tavern.

Something Went Wrong is a quick game which can be played with zero preparation. All you'll need are a d6, a d12, some paper and pencils and a good dose of humor.

Character creation takes roughly 5 minutes and a game can be  played over the course of an hour or two.

The session before last the part discovered a large abandoned Dwarven Citadel and gained access to it through a secret entrance. While exploring they came across a small group of rather weak Drow, got som loot and moved on. Session had run long that week so we put a hold on the game until our next session, just the other day..


Session begins and everyone is having a blast, then they come across a makeshift lair for a young white dragon. I was assuming, as cautious as they usually are and that they hadd a map from the Drow thy killed, that they would go around it.

I was reminded to never underestimate the risks the party will take for loot. They attempted to sneak into the chamber, and were promptly spotted. A fight ensued thereafter that left the dragon in a severely wounded state and many party members had been hit with it's breath weapon. One of our players is more brash than the other and had her character approach it's ""corpse"" (no one saw through it's ruse), and it promptly lunged up, and critically hit her with a bite. It ripped her head off. Party passes horror saves, combat starts again. The dragon managed to tear another character limb from limb before being dispatched, lowering the party total to four.

The loot wasn't all that impressive, so the remaining members gathered it up and used the dragons burrowed cave to slowly trek out to the surface. Trudging along for a day and a half in game they run into:

A pair of kobolds, one a monk the other a druid. (They promptly pummeled them)

A group of eleven zombie kobolds led by a fiendish zombie kobold. (I love random encounter generators)

They led the zombie kobolds to a choke point on a bridge, and begin to quickly dispatch them, when I roll to see if a group of riders I designed for the territory show up, they do. It's an undead type thing, hard to describe, but they can't cross moving water and they are meant to be simply a deterrant to going back into that area currently.

I warned the players, as I felt it was needed since they were kind of feeling invincible after they had survived the dragon fight, to run. Our typically most cautious player decided ""Nope, gonna throw a spear at them.""

The rider that was attacked but missed used ""Wail of the Banshee"" (Spell Compendium), and all but one of the partuy members failed the save, killing them instantly. Upon recovering, the survivor had to make both a horror save and a madness save, failing both to the major degree, and developed both a strong fascination with the riders and schizophrenia.

I now have a rich and (for the time being) insane PC that was once CG and is now LE. :/

This is going to be interesting.

***BIG EDIT FOR THOSE THAT HAVE ISSUE WITH THE WAY THIS STORY PLAYED OUT (copied from one of my lower replies):***

***One thing no one has bothered to ask me: ""What was the will save DC?""***

***See, this is an important question, as it shows how hard I was actually trying to kill them versus scare the daylights out of them. I fudged this number down a lot, to a grand total of: 16.***

***That was the DC they had to succeed on. Only one character made it. I did that assuming most, if not all of them would survive. I was wrong due to die rolls.***

***Calling someone out on being a bad DM is all well and good, but why on earth is no one actually asking me questions to get a detailed idea of what exactly happened rather then a story format?***

***Not a single person did that when they had an issue with how it played out, instead deciding to berate me about it and essentially say this: Screw you, you are a horrible DM.***

***For those that actually read my replies, thank you, much appreciated. For those that payed attention to the fact that my player group actually enjoys when they face a tough situation, again thank you.***

***Now, if anyone else has an issue with how I ran this or assumes me to be a horrible DM because of how it played out, remember this:***

***I nerfed the DC down to 16.***

***The party was given multiple chances to avoid this end result, and chose not to.***

***My players have always left in good spirits, even after a party wipe due to a monster or a mistake because of the way it plays out and the way I describe the situation.***

Trick: He told the players to build characters for an evil campaign, and was a little more flexible on the character creation rules than normal. Was going to be a high power campaign, so build characters at level 12 (I think, it was years ago, so I forget the exact number). All the players devise the awesome characters, whole back stories, stacked stats to focus on one or two abilities with monstrous DC's, stuff like that. First session rolls around, DM gathers the character sheets and tell the players to roll level 1 normal characters... we just built all the BBEG's for the campaign world.


Twist: DM liked to build his own worlds, never ran pre-built adventures. We were fighting a war due to some political struggles in the world. After about 6 or 8 sessions we realize, the reason all these names seem familiar is we are in the same world as before. The leaders of these armies are our characters from the previous campaign. The DM had taken the state of the world at the end of the last campaign and moved the story forward about 30 years. It really made us invest a lot more into role playing our characters, as at the end of the campaign, the DM would take our behavior to determine how our PC's would behave in the creation of the next campaign world.

Well, we held onto this horn for quite awhile.  We let the Wizard hold onto it, but he never removed it from his pack because we treasured it so much that we didn't to break it in any way or have someone notice it and attempt to steal it. Literally about every game session we talked about it.  In the weeks ahead, it actually consumed many of our conversations, and there were times where we almost sounded the horn just to see this army, and to finally see the awesome power that apparently laid in our hands.  By level 16, we had accidently started a war between one Kingdom and an Orc Horde and its Red Dragon allies (we didn't realize that the Orcs had an alliance with the Red Dragons, and we had just been given shields that had that Kingdom's sigil on it, and so when a Young Red Dragon escaped a fight, the Dragons and Orcs blamed the Kingdom for breaking the treaty.)  

Well, as the campaign progressed, we attempted to help this Kingdom in every way possible since we felt like dicks for starting this war.  However, the Kingdom couldn't defend itself properly and eventually a Dragon/Orc army ascended onto the Capital.  We attempted to fight, and we actually led a charge out of the walls but had to retreat, leaving many many dead and wounded behind.  

With the Dragons slowly winning the air campaign and the orcs beginning to destroy the second and last wall in the city, we knew it was time.  The Wizard took out the horn for the first time in order to sound it, and that's when the Cleric, who was about 25 feet away, succeded in his roll to figure out what the symbol on the side was, and he slowly began to shout ""NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!"" but the Wizard failed his listen check due to the raging battle going on around us with Orcs just outside the gate and Dragons swooping in breathing their fire and the screams of the wounded and dying, and he sounded the horn.

A round later, Orcus, the Demon Lord of the Undead appears with a Demon Army, right outside the city gates.  Needless to say Orcus pushed off the Orc and Dragon invasion, however, he immediately turned his sites on the already breached city, replenishing his troops with the untold numbers of the bodies of the fallen.  Needless to say, the city fell, and all, including us, were slain.

tl;dr: We were given a divine horn that would bring an ""otherworldly army"" to help us just once when we needed it, we obsessed over the horn, then after an Orc/Red Dragon invasion, we used it only to learn that it summoned Orcus, Demon Lord of the Undead, who used the slain bodies in the battle to raise an army of undead to murder the Orcs and Dragons, and us.

Some facts

* Made from plywood and pine for the edging
* has slots for 7 players and 1 GM with enough room for character sheet, Dice, drink, whatever
* Was designed to be movable and fit on top of my existing coffee table
* on the corners there is a slot to stick books, other papers.
* The bottom is 4'X5'  while the top playing surface is 3'X4' with a lipped edge to attempt to keep dice on the able(instead of the floor as they sometimes go
* The DM side has no dividers

Eventual plans

* Paint
* Add LED lights
* maybe gridded plexiglass top

8. Thou shalt not say no. Partial success of a poor plan is better than total failure.

I'm Fred Hicks, and I run Evil Hat Productions on a day to day basis. 

Evil Hat has published a few RPGs (Spirit of the Century, Don't Rest Your Head, the Dresden Files RPG, and others), and more recently we're branching out into new areas, as with our recently concluded Dinocalypse Trilogy kickstarter campaign (launching a fiction line of 7 novels!), and upcoming plans for board and card games (Race to Adventure, Zeppelin Armada). 

I'm bringing along a few members of the Evil Hat crew today:

* Fred Hicks (that's me), co-president
* Leonard Balsera (baneofcows), lead system developer for Fate
* Daniel Solis, creator of Happy Birthday Robot and Do
* Brad Murray, one of the creators of Diaspora
* Ryan Macklin, editor &amp; project manager
* Brian Engard, writer and Fate system developer
* John Adamus, editor 

Some of the above folks don't wake up for another few hours, but we should see 'em all over the course of the day.

**We're here to answer your questions about Evil Hat's business, games, past, present, successes, failures -- anything!**

That said, let's try to keep this positive. No busting on other companies or their games, please. That's a waste of your and our time. :) 

When possible, please break unrelated questions out into separate posts for ease of organizing our replies.

**Let's do this!**

UPDATE: I (Fred) have to run off to get my kid from daycare and then go see The Avengers, so I'm out for the evening. I may come back and answer more stuff that pops up in my inbox, tho, and the other hatters may still be at it.

I was reading through some old D&amp;D modules, and those dungeons were just bananas; every room seemed so random.

Everyone add a room, I'll start with the entryway. If we get a good turnout, this could be something we could all use to randomize a dungeon on the fly. Go nuts, traps, monsters, puzzles. Don't let genre or system restrict you. Try to verbalize challenge ratings, so instead of DC 15, write something like _the lock looks *tough* to pick_.

Pay attention to the door descriptions to previous rooms and use them in your own.

Start each section with the entrance, that is, where the PCs have entered the room.

Once it's run its course, I'll likely edit and PDF it, then release it back out so we can all use it.

Have fun!

--------------------------------------------------------------


*Entrance: North*

You're standing in the entryway looking down a long corridor, the breeze from the outside world does nothing to alleviate the damp and the stink coming from down in the dark. You're facing south, the corridor is made of slate grey cobbles and thick dark masonry, unused torch sconces line the walls, a slight dripping sound sings sporadic in the gloom. The corridor is roughly twenty feet wide with high ceilings and stretches into the darkness to the south. Ten feet in, on the east wall, there's a stout wooden door. Twenty feet up on the west wall is an iron gate. Where do you go?

Notes: The door to the east is locked, there's a black iron keyplate. It's old, and someone of average skill should be able to figure it out with little trouble.

Fifteen feet into the room is a loose flagstone that contains the broken trigger to an inert dart trap, triggered long ago.

**Edit: Okay, feel free to add more rooms, I'm going to keep checking, but I think we've got enough for a pretty bad-ass old-school dungeon here. If I see any new entries that are outstanding I'll add them, but right now I'm going to go ahead and create a final document with what's here. I've got a few other projects that I need to get through, so I may not have a final document until next week or so.

The game (DnD 3.5) kept going without him. When he left the game, the party was in the middle of a dungeon, and none of the players questioned his character's sudden absence. I interpreted this to mean that they left him behind in a room and didn't notice he was missing. The game has gone on for a couple years at this point, and they have progressed significantly. 

Well, I got to talking with the player that had to drop out about the game, and he wants to play again. He can't believe the others, one of whom is his real life brother, abandoned him in a dungeon! He wants revenge for their treachery. Unknownst to the party but knownst to us, I have started playing with him in solo games to catch his character up and allow him to build a machination of eeevil to spring upon the others. I figured it's a cheap way for me to get a new villain in the game, and maybe breath some life into a campaign that's getting a little stale. 

The thing is, I'm having some trouble getting the villain PC set up as an arch villain in a way that seems believable to us. In the past, I just made all the villains by fiat! Now I have to create a story with this player that can lead to villainy, and I've never had to run a game from this side. I'm a little stuck. He has a motivation, but how do we RP the construction of his evil plan? For that matter, we still have to create an evil plan... I have an idea of introducing him to other villains, but it seems kind of lame to have him just walk in and say ""Hey there Other Villainous Person, I want to get them and their little dog too, too!"" He needs his own adventures that will set him up with the resources he will need. Minions. A lair. Contacts close to the party in a position to betray them.

We have a vision for the reveal, in which he comes over to the game just to ""hang out"" and sends me his moves via text chat. At some point, he takes over for the villain, in character, and we have a dramatic moment of ""Oh shit it was YOU!"" and the others are floored as they realize the true identity of their nemisis.

1335699544.0,175,self.rpg,sy24b,Here is the ridiculous story of epic fail from my D&amp;D game this weekend.,outshyn,215,40,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/sy24b/here_is_the_ridiculous_story_of_epic_fail_from_my/,"I had a group of 4 players for the game.  One player is running a half-orc fighter, level 4.  [You may remember him.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/rl0ia/inventive_ways_that_pcs_have_circumvented_your/c46rucb)  Normally, he's deadly and ruins tough encounters by being too good.  However, this weekend he went supernova and utterly failed.  It was awesome how intricate, well-planned, and utterly wrecked it all was.

We are playing in the module The Dragonfiend Pact.  This module has a custom spell, Improved Reduce Person.  It takes a character down 2 size categories, essentially taking a full grown, six-foot-tall man, and reducing him to the size of a newborn baby -- though of course he isn't a baby and retains his full faculties.  The spell is intended to assist as the PCs chase down some small creatures in a few tiny caverns.  The module anticipates what my group did *not at all.*

In my game, they didn't use all the potions, and one bad guy -- a goblin assassin -- eluded them.  The goblin makes it to his tribe, and now things are dangerous for the 4th-level characters.  They can kill any goblin, and kill many.  But with 200 of them, they couldn't be sure that they'd even get close enough to the goblin assassin before he'd just take off for good.  They needed bait.

At this point, the player who is running the big dumb fighter comes up with a plan.  He starts singing ""orc in a box"" to the tune of the SNL song, ""dick in a box.""  He says to the group, ""I'll drink the Improved Reduce Person potion.  Stuff me in the treasure chest.  Pour gold on top of me.  When the spell expires, I will grow, but only when I have room for it.  I can't get squished from growing too big in the chest.  So, I will be a tiny fighter in a small chest, and when it opens I can stand and grow back to full size immediately.""  He goes on to suggest that he will drink an enlarge person potion, and enable his ape's fury feat (+2 to strength for 10 rounds).  This will make him *massive.*

**How massive?**

He goes from 6' 7"" tall to 13' 2"" tall -- bigger than hill giants.  His weight goes from 270 to 2160.  He's large size with a reach of 10'.  His strength goes from 21 to 25.  He has the Monkey Grip feat so that he may wield a large weapon, which becomes a huge weapon thanks to the enlarge person potion -- meaning he will do 4d6 + 18 when he power attacks with his 2-handed great sword.  *His minimum damage is 22 points, versus goblins with 5 HP each.*

Aside from the potion, this guy has almost no magic items.  He's just absurdly dangerous from picking feats well.  It's nuts.

**The approach**

The party comes to the goblin cave, but is held off by a few scouts.  They alert the goblin assassin, who sneaks out of the cave, creeps toward the party (+17 to hide &amp; move silently, and rolled well, for totals of something like 32), and climbs a tree.  He's so well camouflaged that when he talks to them and they know he's in the tree, they still have a hard time tracking him.  He tells them to open the chest so that he may see the tribute they have brought to him.  He appears impressed, but then asks them to move away from the chest, and then the goblin goes quiet for a few minutes.  The party is just delirious with glee at this point -- they wait, assuming he will come out of the tree to get the treasure, then Mr. Giant will stand up, and utterly slaughter the goblin in a surprise round.

They are not even concerned that the goblin has class levels.  They assume the fighter will kill him with a single swing, anyway.  And they are right, if that's what happened.  But it didn't.

**Pandemonium**

Eventually, 4 goblins trot out of the cave, over to the treasure box.  They express joy at finding the loot, and then one poor soul *reaches in to grab a fistful of gold.*  Cue giant.

He stands, immediately growing from about 1 foot tall to over 13 feet tall.  His muscles bulge.  His sword is ridiculously large.  Gold pieces fly through the air, and the treasure chest is crushed under the feet of the newly-massive fighter.  And... even though he was in the chest and could not have known that the goblin assassin was in the tree, that's what he goes for.  He ignores the 4 goblins at his feet, and attacks *the tree.*  Never mind that it's 100% metagaming -- he was in the box and never heard *where* the goblin assassin was at.  Never mind that during the 2 minutes of silence, the assassin had stealthily climbed back down the tree and secretly re-entered the cave.  Just, ""KILL TREE!""  But even worse, he doesn't swing his sword.  He *grapples* the tree to try to pull it over and ""shake out"" the hidden goblin.

And he rolls a natural 1 on a strength check to pull out the 20' tall tree.  Even with his strength bonus, all this does is bend the tree top over a little bit.

We go around the table, everyone taking turns trying to destroy the 4 little goblins that Mr. Giant is ignoring.  When it is the large fighter's turn again, he's still utterly convinced that the goblin must be in the tree and I'm withholding.  And to be honest, since he's metagaming, I kinda let him run with it for *two more rounds.*  After 3 rounds of tugging at the tree and getting nowhere -- though leaves were flying *everywhere* and the 4 little goblins were pissing their pants -- I laugh and say, ""This is great!  You are playing a brutally strong and utterly stupid half-orc, and you just spent 3 rounds of battle wrestling an empty tree.  I'd say this is *totally* in character.""

Finally the 4 goblins are killed, and the players think the goblin assassin that was hiding in the tree must have used it to get to *higher ground.*  Yep, they don't even bother to consider that he might have gone back into the cave where he lives.  They assume he's leapt from the treetop to the top of a nearby (10' away) mountain cliff.  So Mr. Giant lifts his allies to this ledge, and they try to track the goblin while Mr. Giant goes utterly ape-shit on the tree, strength-checking again and again until he cracks it off.  (If any of you have ever heard a tree crack in half, you know it's loud -- so loud it might damage your eardrums -- so they sorta broadcast themselves to the entire region at that point.)

**Everything goes wrong**

The trackers find no tracks and finally realize he's probably just in his lair.  Everyone is lifted back down, and they prepare to run into the cave and utterly *ruin* everything inside.  At this point I ask the player who is tracking initiative, ""Great, you're at the cave entrance, ready to go in.  How many rounds has it been to get to this point?""  The player tells me we just wrapped up round 10.  So I nod and say, ""Boy, I hope spending all that time with the tree was worth it.  As you rush in, you see your giant fighter in the lead suddenly shrink to normal size as the potion wears off, and then his rippling huge biceps return to normal as his ape's fury wears off, and then... sneak attack arrows from the darkness.  You can find out if you survive the sneak damage at the next game, because that's a wrap.""

All the players sat there dumbfounded for a moment, and then everyone at the table burst out with debate about who screwed up their huge advantage.

For my part, I gleefully put away my books and hummed a little song to myself.  I can't wait for the next game.  ;)",,False,,t5_2qh2s,True,,,True,t3_sy24b,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/sy24b/here_is_the_ridiculous_story_of_epic_fail_from_my/,

In the campaign, the PCs would be five individuals chosen for a mysterious cosmic quest. Each PC would be from a different world/universe. 

So one player could be a vampire from the World of Darkness, another a Jedi from the Star Wars galaxy, another a D&amp;D Cleric, and so on.

They would all be collected together, four of the PCs teleported to one of the five worlds, to meet the PC from that world. They would learn that their quest is to travel through their respective different worlds, and perhaps one day, others, in order to save the Multiverse. 

In order to do this all the PCs would create char sheets for every one of the five games being played, but they would retain the identity, knowledge, and memories of their main, original/alpha character. 

The campaign would alternate between the five gameworlds and their respective rulesets. So for instance the first few sessions might be set in a D&amp;D world on some important quest, but after achieving a specific goal (think Quantum Leap) the five PCs would 'jump' to another world, say the World of Exalted, and would either form new bodies and skills fitting that world, or jump into the bodies of heroes already there. And then everyone would get their Exalted char sheets and play some Exalted, while still playing the original characters, just having moved bodies.

Every few sessions the PCs would jump between worlds, and jumps would often take place just before resolving important and intriguing plot hooks, so players might be waiting on finishing up 3-4 plots at the same time, in different universes. 

The characters would only have the abilities that would be possible in whatever universe they were currently. So a Superhero or Jedi character who jumped into a d20 Modern Spy thriller would not be able to use their special powers there, but might be transformed into something else, perhaps even someone with quite different skills.

Long-term goals could include being able to use powers independently of the world they were currently in such as a Jedi character learning to use the Force outside of the SW galaxy. 

This would be crazy, and basically be five campaigns running at once.

But I cannot get this idea out of my head, I literally can't stop thinking about it, because I think it's so fucking cool.

I've been GM-ing for about 8-9 years, and I find I want to try new things. I just wonder if this is too crazy. Even if it is I will have to continue working on this and perhaps try it one day.

Long story short, it was a descent into hell, although the characters really didn't know what was going on.  It was heavily inspired by Dante's Inferno and set in the Wild West.

At a farmhouse, they had stopped to stretch their legs, get a little food, and switch out the horses of the coach they were riding, and the people there were strange and scary.  They didn't know it, but they were approaching the gates of hell.

The farmhouse featured food where the meat was somewhat suspect, the farmer and his wife looked suspiciously closely related, and their daughter who was wise beyond her years but looked like she had sever Down's Syndrome.  

This was just the outskirts of hell, which was actually in a roadhouse up the path a ways, and was just meant to get them in the mood a little.  They were nicely freaked out.

The little girl kept telling them that they should turn back, and then went to open the barn door to let something out.  What they didn't know was that she had a pet goat, that was deformed, and had three heads.  But they never saw it.  I never had an opportunity to spring it on them.  I didn't need to.  They were so freaked out by the noises it was making that they prevented the little girl from opening up the barn, jumped on the coach and made a run for it.

Them running away from something they couldn't see was so much better than having to fight a three-headed goat.  It really set the tone for the rest of the night, too.  It was awesome.

The three headed goat was analogous to Cereberus, guarding the gates of hell, but they never found that out.

My group and I got off track during a session recently and got to reminiscing about some of our favorite adventures. One story came up a few times and I thought I’d share. The world is your standard high fantasy with elves and dwarves and magic and whatnot, but the system is a complete homebrew system we’ve been using for quite a while now. So if some of what I say doesn’t match what you’re used to, don’t worry it’s all good. 

Late one night a massive storm washes out the main bridge over the River Rye cutting the group’s home village off from much needed trade traffic. The flooding was enough to change the flow of the river and prevent a bridge from being rebuilt on the site. So the team - a dwarf engineer, a human thief and a hunchbacked little wizard’s apprentice - are hired by the city fathers to journey up the river and find a place where a new bridge can be built and then get it ready for the builders who will be along in a few days. Because you know cutting folks’ purses, hacking them to bits and then using magic to set them on fire is fun and all but in this sleepy little village it’s not enough to pay the bills.

They finally find a spot that is located just downstream from the outflow of a dark and murky swamp. (Note: never try to draw a swamp on your battlemap when one of players assesses wetland quality for a living. You think rules lawyers are bad? You don’t even know.) After a couple of days of work they finish the job but by now its too late to journey back to the village so they decide to camp for one more night and head back in the morning. They’d been hearing strange noises from the swamp for the last few nights and had been posting watches like good little gamers. But this night they hear roaring, growling and what sounds like the cackling of an old crone getting nearer and nearer the edge of the swamp. They take up their arms and lo and behold a big, angry troll comes bursting out of the swamp. It’s half burned and before it decides to charge them it hides something in the bushes. This confuses the players a bit as they are used to my trolls charging first no matter what the situation...but everybody decides that all is right with the world when on its next action it charges the dwarf first. Needless to say they fought and defeated the troll and then braced for whatever the hell was cackling in the swamp to come rushing out next. When nothing happened they decided to go see what the troll had hidden - actually there was a discussion about whether or not anybody really wanted to know what a troll would hide, but I digress. And there in the bushes was the cutest little troll baby they had ever seen.

The thief and the hunchback were all in favor of killing the thing where it laid and getting the hell out of there middle of the night or no. But the dwarf - who’s player can’t be bothered with meta-human stereotypes, has never conformed to an alignment a day in her life and can generally be counted on to do the opposite of what the rest of the party wants - decided it was cute and couldn’t be left for whatever was laughing away in the dark. So the other team members - having seen our lovely dwarf delight at cutting off other people’s limbs - both agreed that “Wow, that is the cutest troll I’ve ever seen...now lets get the hell out of here.” As they’re running away they hear off in the distance that annoying cackle turn into a scream of rage with the words “Where is it? Where is the child?”

Jump forward several weeks to the sleepy little town of Millbury on the Rye where the party lives and things are not going so well for our dwarf and it’s new pet. The thing is growing like a weed and eating through more food than our character can afford. Pretty soon peoples’ pets start disappearing and something has raided a neighbor’s chicken coop. Chaining the troll up works for about a day until it realizes it’s strong enough to just pull the chain out of the wall and head out the window. People around town are starting to talk about seeing a monstrous creature prowling around at night and there’s talk about forcing the town leaders to hire someone to hunt the thing down. It has, however - and against all reason - decided the dwarf is it’s Mama despite being a full head taller. 

Our other characters are actively avoiding the dwarf and its charge at this point and quietly wondering how high a village imposed reward for the capture of the “monster” will go before they decide to turn the dwarf in to the authorities. Around this time a pretty young woman shows up in town and starts making friends with the thief and the wizard. She tells them she is thinking about leaving to look for work in the next town over because of the “monster” rumors. “And wouldn’t that be the most dreadful thing after she’s just getting to know all of these nice people.” (Can you see where this is going? Because my players couldn’t.) The thief - intrigued - decides to tail our young woman around town for a while and notices her flirting with several of the other tough guys in town and decides she’s just a working girl and leaves her alone. The hunchback though is entranced by this new beauty who is actually nice enough to talk to His Hideousness. He hangs around her long enough to realize she’s actively trying to agitate the good townsfolk into violence against whatever it is thats been eating their dogs and scaring their kids. As he’s trying to decide what to do about this someone bursts into the scene and says he just saw the monster run into the place where “that dwarf” lives. Our heroic hunchback trots on over to the dwarf’s residence just minutes before the crowd gets there waving pitchforks and torches and demanding blood. And just in case you were wondering, our thief is at the back of the crowd helping light torches in the hopes that he’s going to get some free entertainment.

Inside the dwarf’s home they’re getting ready to try and have a reasonable discussion with a mob. This means throwing the troll out of a second story window (“Look at him he’s so cute how can I just throw him out the window?” “He’s a troll, he’ll regenerate.” “Right, help me pick him up.”), and then putting on every piece of armor and every weapon you can fit on something 4.5 feet tall and 3 feet wide. They head to the front door and the hunchback opens the door so the dwarf can lumber out impressively...and then immediately shuts and locks it and watches from a window. By this point the young lady has got the crowd worked up to a fervor and they’re not about to listen to reason. The dwarf is denying that anything is living there, the woman is shouting that they should knock the dwarf down and search the house, the hunchback is looking for the back door and the thief is sniggering from the back of the crowd. The only thing keeping the mob from surging into the house is the fact several people are going to lose kneecaps before they can get past the dwarf.

Just as things are about to get really nasty someone screams from the edge of the crowd “There it is!” From the characters point of view it looks like a straight line of people being knocked down by something moving fast and folks on either side running away from whatever is trampling mob members. It’s clear that whatever it is heading straight for the pretty lady and the crowd surges away leaving her standing by herself. Into the sudden circle bursts the troll child who knuckles up to the lady at speed and bites her in the kneecap. She bats the troll aside with the back of her hand but it’s too late. The bite causes her to drop her magical disguise and she is revealed for the Bog Hag that she really is. A big, strapping lad from the crowd rushes in and tries to take her down with a well placed blow, which she catches with one hand and then brings the poor guy to the ground with a punch almost too fast to see. She then cackles the cackle that the group heard coming from the swamp and says, “Give me the troll child for my evil potion or this whole town will suffer.” 

At this point the thief decides this isn’t so funny and tries to sneak up for the back stab. But the Hag senses him and he gets our incapacitated local lad thrown at him for his troubles. The dwarf and it’s (yes, “it’s” I’ve never figured out what gender it really is) armor have finally gotten up to speed for a swipe at the hags midsection with it’s battleaxe. This isn’t the the most agile of dwarves and when she sidesteps it she’s able to put a knee into it’s chin and snatch it’s axe away. “Oh great,” says someone in the crowd, “now they’ve gone and armed the damn thing.” The hunchback isn’t doing much good because a lot of people from the crowd are pressed up against the door of the house he’s in trying to stay away from a hag with a battleaxe. At this point things aren’t looking good for our team - especially the dwarf who’s about to have his/her head split open with his/her own battleaxe. Suddenly a cry that sounds a bit like Sloth from the Goonies yelling Mama (or Dada - that gender is none of my business) echoes from the darkness and an enraged troll child rushes out, makes a leap that would shame Pete Townshend and lands fangs first on the hag’s head. The hag’s attention goes to the troll just long enough for our Dwarf to pull a knife and stab her in the foot, the thief to pull a throwing blade and land it between her shoulder blades and the hunchback to finally get out the front door and cast a spell that sets her rags on fire. 

While these blows weren’t enough to bring her down on their own, it was enough to turn the tide in the battle and allow our characters to emerge victorious. After the Hag is dispatched there is still the problem of the mob hanging around who had just been after the Troll child. The party was sure they were going to have to fight their way out of town when someone in the crowd yells, “Hey, that troll just saved us from that hag!” And everyone starts cheering. The troll is found and given plenty of celebratory pats on the back and all the garbage he can eat and the crowd finally disperses with a whole new interesting tale to tell their children. Over the next few days it is generally agreed that having a tame troll around may not be bad for keeping the riff-raff out of town and could actually be something of a tourist draw. The expense of feeding and caring for it - of course - is left up to the dwarf. 

And that’s the story of how an orphaned troll became the unwitting hero of the Village of Millbury on the Rye.

You have personal connections with 2 or more players in the party and a vested interest in their role.

Here's how it works. (Based on Fiasco) Sitting around the table, or in a rough circle, put an index card in between each adjacent player.  Each player (including the GM) takes out 2 D8s.  Everyone rolls their D8s into the middle, forming one large dice pool of ~12 (depending on number of players) D8s all randomized.

Starting with the player on the left of the GM, the first PC picks any die from the pool showing the number they want to use.  The die number correlates to one area of relationship, and they chose which adjacent character it responds to, then writes it on their shared index card, removing that die from the D8 pool.  Their relationship now fits within that category.  The next PC has the opportunity to either choose a category relationship or fill in the details of a previously chosen relationship category on one of their cards.  PCs are always defining their personal relationships with the two players on either side of them, not across the table. You go around (Skipping the GM) until all but two dice have been chosen.  PCs know all of the categories and all of the details, so when the pick a number, they know exactly what they're getting.  The only rolling happens when you form the D8 pool at the beginning, and the GM shouldn't need to ""reveal"" any relationship.  I print out spare copies of this list for my players to peruse prior to their turn.

These relationships are sometimes open ended and need to be defined by the players (NOT the GM, though they can offer advice or give hints as to what's to come). Sometimes the relationships won't come to fruition until the game is well underway, though it's encouraged to work game-relevant details out before the beginning of the game.

*The idea is that it gives your characters a starting point for their relationships, not to step on character creation toes.  If someone doesn't like the relationship chosen for them, it's thrown out, no questions asked (though their adjacent PC is free to make arguments or allow them to come to a compromise about it), and either they can pick another die (One of the extra 2D8s) or be party poopers and ignore the relationship altogether.*

I run this as part of a character creation session prior to beginning actual character creation.  It inspires PCs and encourages team-work.

Yesterday [aWOLtrooper](http://www.reddit.com/user/aWOLtrooper) posted a transcript of a role playing adventure that he ran for a stranger on [Omegle](http://omegle.com), a site which randomly matches you up to chat with a stranger. 

[Here is a link to the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/vearv/role_play_with_a_stranger_yes_i_did/).

In his post, he mentioned how hard it was to find someone who actually wanted to play a role playing adventure and not just chat (or whatever else people do on those random chat sites). Since there seemed to be a lot of interest in this style of RPG playing, the question on my mind was [why not make a site that supports this](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/vearv/role_play_with_a_stranger_yes_i_did/c53wyf6)?

On this site, you would be thrown into a room with random strangers, one of whom is the DM. That person runs a short roleplaying adventure for the players who are there.

I would personally love to use a site like this, and several other people are interested considering the replies to my comment on aWOLtrooper's post.

So, I am wondering, who all is really interested in this? It is such a simple idea, but it could be really fun for DMs and players alike. 

Several people replied to my comment suggesting existing alternatives to a completely new site. IRC/other chat programs with a dice rolling site were suggested, but this fails to match players up with DMs randomly, which was the main point of aWOLtrooper's original post. 

Also suggested was using [Roll20](http://roll20.net/) and/or Google+ to play. These solutions, however, seem really heavyweight and include everything for a full tabletop roleplaying experience. I think something simpler will suffice: a chat window and some way of rolling dice publicly (for chance-based decisions).

I am really interested in seeing this become a reality. Several people replied to my comment expressing an interest in helping, and I happen to be a programmer with a couple years of web development experience. I figure that, if we decide that this is a good idea, we could create a subreddit to discuss the development of this site and a GitHub project to publicly collaborate on the site (releasing it under an open source license). I have a bit of web space that I am not using, and I would be willing to host the site to get it started.

What do you think, Redditors?

 http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/uyeep/10_tips_on_being_better_pcs/


Now I'm back to offer 10 tips and tricks for the other side of the table.

1. Use your player's backstory: Self-explanatory, but often forgoten. Spook PCs with enigmatic reveals of past secrets but someone they have never met, bring random people who remember them, let them add people as the campaign progresses. PC was a thief in this town? Let him remember his old gang and a fence and her family he knew. Not everything needs to have been set in stone. It makes for a more immersive campaign.

2. Have Your Own Backstory: Villain Pasts are as important as hero pasts. Explore them and let the PCs explore them. Make your villains more monsterous or more relatable. It works both ways.

3. Plan Ahead: It doesn't matter if the PCs flee the plot like a belt of gender swaping. Have something prepared anything. A dungeon in spare is a personal favorite of mine, have a standby dungeon set aside for whenever the plot gets ignored and have some story and stuff for that. Plan the loot you are handing out. Paintings? See to it they reflect your NPC enemies again the little things help make a great campaign.

4. Stay Organized: I hate this one. With a passion that grants me +2 to hit, but it is important. Remember most NPCs and remember all PC actions. I have a little notebook where I record a PCs actions for good, law, balance, chaos, and evil, so I can award RP XP and ask questions about their character.

5. Stay Involved: Nothing turns players off faster than an unintrested GM. Learn their characters offer them roleplaying hooks for their own development. Give them people to hate and befriend be it a barfly intrested in chatting up sports or a devious necromancer digging up the bones of their sister give them something to work with. More fun for all.

6. Know the Rules: Your job is part enemy, part storyteller, and part ref. Knowing the rules will speed up play and make things run smoother encounters will be more fun if you don't spend 2 minutes remembering what their enemies can do.

7. Don't Sweat the Rules: Let the player's have somethings. Trust your players to know how their attacks work and don't double check everything they do.

8. Make NPC Enemies Memorable: That sometimes means letting them run. ""Remember that guy we killed?"" ""Which One?"" is not what you want you want ""Remember that guy who swore vengance after breaking PC X's new sword while giving us the bird?"" so that (I have a PC who does this) when they are mentioned their first thought is ""F$%&amp; that guy.""

9. Improvise: Just as planning is important being spontaneous is as well. Know your NPC personalities and roll with whatever. PCs do something completely unexpected? Run with it and don't look back.

10. Know Your Godhood: Don't fall into the trap of being too nice. Remember to lay down the law. Not as a vengeful god, but as a referee. Don't force players to make discisions by limiting their options and avoid choiceless railroading. No magic items for sale means just that, it doesn't matter what the GM's guide says your word is law and they can quote it all they like. Remember what you say goes, but do so in a way that makes the campaign better. (Edited: For clarity we at r/rpg do not advocate tyrancial GMing)

1338872374.0,167,self.rpg,ullv0,"""I throw the baby at her!"" What is the craziest WTF things your players have done in game?",Abstruse,214,47,446,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/ullv0/i_throw_the_baby_at_her_what_is_the_craziest_wtf/,"My weekly Pathfinder game is in Ravenloft right now and I ran a conversion/adaptation of the first part of The Evil Eye adventure. The plot is that a blacksmith lost his new wife in childbirth, but her spirit has been showing up nightly to nurse the baby and get him to play music for her (it makes sense in context). They agreed to help out the blacksmith and free him of her spirit.

So she shows up and a battle ensues. She picks up the baby. The monk takes the baby away. He runs away. The rogue dumps holy water on her. She chases the monk. He runs back into the house. The rogue decides to pour holy water on the baby to protect it. She follows the monk inside. Meanwhile the sorcerer is trying to get the wizard to snap out of his mesmerization and the cleric's been doing his various anti-undead spells. The monk sets the baby down in the corner so he can attempt to fight the ghost.

That was when the rogue got a brilliant idea. ""I pick up the baby, then I throw the baby at her!""

I manage to talk him out of throwing the baby *at* her and just *handing* the baby to her which would work the same way but not require a Powers check (or rather, an automatic failure because *you used a baby as a weapon!*). The wizard finally snapped out of it and cast Grease on the baby so the ghost would have problems picking it up. I shrug and move on. The rogue then says he's going to *slide* the baby at the ghost.

""Using the baby as a bowling ball isn't any better than using it as a shot put!""

So does anyone else have players who had ideas as insane as that? What happened?

**EDIT**: Wow, go to sleep and wake up cursing the fact that self-posts don't give karma. For the record, the entire fight which was originally supposed to be atmospheric and creepy since, well, it's Ravenloft turned into an episode of the Five Stooges. Here's the full play-by-play my sleepy post-DMing brain couldn't remember immediately last night:

The mother's ghost has been showing up every night and nursing the child, making it weak. Hey, this isn't some weird fetish or anything, it's in the original module. Anyway, they're taking up watch when she shows up and wins initiative handily. She walks across the room and picks up the baby. She has a mesmerizing ability which catches both the rogue and the wizard. The monk's up next but due to a previous bad run-in with undead and a failed Horror check, he can only take one action around undead due to pants-wetting terror. So he moves adjacent to her. The cleric Consecrates the ground all around the little hut. Everything's going well, everyone's roleplaying the situation and they're all fearful for the safety of the baby first and foremost. Considering this is a Neutral/Evil party, I'm pleasantly surprised.

Then it's the sorcerer's turn. The elemental-based blaster build sorcerer. I catch him looking over his spell list and immediately remind him, ""She's holding the baby."" He keeps looking at the spells for a moment while the wheels turn and then looks at me. ""So if I cast--"" ""It'll hit the baby too."" So he spends his turn trying to slap the wizard out of it.

The rogue saves out of the enchantment and decides to pick up the violin in the corner and start playing it (this isn't as odd an action as it might seem as the violin is the item that's holding her ghost to this plane). The mother starts to nurse the baby as her action for the turn. The monk tries to snatch the baby away but fails. The cleric casts another anti-undead spell of some sort.

The sorcerer finally manages to snap the wizard out of it and the wizard decides to cast Enlarge Person on the baby. So now the two week old infant is three feet tall. Yeah...

So the mother's looking confused (she didn't really see anyone else there as she was focused on her baby) but keeps nursing her now very large infant. The monk manages to snatch the baby away this time, which makes the sorcerer's day as he finally is able to cast Magic Missile (which, because of his build, does Fire damage which does not get around the ghost's damage reduction). The rogue meanwhile has dropped the violin and dumped holy water on the ghost.

So the ghost tries to take her baby back but the monk's CMD is too high (I'd been running it as if it were Disarm attempts just because it seemed easier that way). The monk runs away with the baby, everyone does random things, the ghost runs through everyone on her way outside to get her baby back, which is when they find out that she does 7d6 damage when she passes through someone with no need to make an attack roll. She tries again to take her baby back but fails as the monk runs back inside the hut and puts the baby down so he has his hands free to attack. So she comes through again (doing more damage and almost killing the sorcerer).

This is when the wizard decides to cast Grease on the baby, so that anytime anyone tries to pick her up they have to make a DC18 Reflex save. Cue Family Guy voices and me deciding I hate playing Ravenloft with this group. And that's when the shenanigans above happens.

For the record, various PCs and NPCs kept trying to pick up the baby and botching their Reflex saves. So I figured that would mean the baby slipped out of their hands and slid a few feet on the floor. Except when the father tried it and rolled a 1, where the baby slid all the way into the wall and took some damage (about the only good thing that Enlarge Person did really as it bumped up the baby's HP so she didn't die).

Now that I think about it, that scene was pretty creepy...a 3 foot tall newborn being nursed by a ghost mother then sliding all around the floor while crying in baritone...yeesh...

**EDIT 2 IMPORTANT**: For anyone who is telling me that I'm a ""bad DM"" because I ""metagamed"" by talking the player out of the action, I want to say this. This is my game. Yes, I know the mentality currently is ""it's the group's game"" and that it should be fun for everyone. However, without me, there is no game.

I put between three and eight hours a week designing the adventures and plotting out the long story arcs that have been going on in the game, advancing them behind the scenes so that the world feels organic. I create maps, stat out monsters and NPCs, create decision trees so that I have notes to cover the most common situations that come up. I make sure that I have the proper minis, maps, hand-outs, etc. for the game session each week. I do research digging up magic items, spells, and feats from old blogs and out-of-print sourcebooks that my players may find enjoyable. I practice accents and impressions, read books and watch documentaries about ancient cultures and history, and do a lot of research into mythology. I put a lot of work into this game *on top of* the 4-6 hours in which I have to play referee, storyteller, improv actor, and sometimes family counselor when tensions between players get too high.

I do all this work because I have fun and love running a game. There are some things which will destroy any joy or sense of accomplishment I get from running these games. I don't want to roleplay out a player's trip to a brothel or trying to seduce random women when it has no baring whatsoever on the plot. I refuse to run a game where wanton murder of innocents, destruction, and especially rape are involved. And I definitely do not want to run a game where a two week old newborn is used as an improvised throwing weapon.

If you want to play a game with an amoral referee who doesn't care what your characters do, I can suggest many great video games. But I am a living person and I do have moral limits on what I will and will not allow in my games. I'm 32 years old. Things like ""rape pillage and burn"" evil campaigns and describing sexual situations that have no baring on the story hold absolutely no interest in me and are not fun. And why in the hell should I put in hours of work every week if I'm not having fun? 

Play your games however you want to play them, but don't tell me that I'm a bad DM because I have limits for what sort of grossly immoral behavior I'll allow in mine.",,False,,t5_2qh2s,1338924072.0,,,True,t3_ullv0,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/ullv0/i_throw_the_baby_at_her_what_is_the_craziest_wtf/,

In the center is a low raised dais on which sits a stone sarcophagus. After checking for traps the party advances to examine this sarcophagus. Suddenly all of the runes come alive and scuttle toward you, swarming over you like small spiders.*

I call these things *Rune Spiders*. They are non-poisonous and only have 2 hp each, but because they are small enough to crawl under armor they attack at +4, biting for 1 hp damage. The room contains 2000 of them, and about 200 will be able to swarm over the PCs in the first round. 

The PCs in this party are tanks, and the wizards are good at wiping out opposing forces from a safe distance, or at least heavily whittling them down so the fighters can easily mop up. Combat tends to be quick and often trivial. As a result the players have gotten somewhat complacent because their characters rarely take much damage. I've gotten used to challenging them more with puzzles and traps, using opponents that are dangerous at a distance, and discouraging scorched-earth magic by placing monsters in the midst of bystanders or valuable, delicate treasures. 

The idea here is to put the PCs in some actual danger without throwing *Disintegrate* spells at them, by pitting them against a massive number of tiny creatures that can cumulatively do significant damage, and which can't be destroyed en masse by area spells because they will immediately get in amongst the characters. 

I was a little worried about this room, because I didn't want to be accused of just trying to kill off the party. I just want to make combat difficult for a change. Then I happened across a small note at the bottom of page 25 of the 1st Ed. PHB (we are old grognards playing 1E, with a house-rules spell point system). It says that against opponents of less than 1 hit die, and non-exceptional (0 level) humans, fighter-type characters are entitled to one attack per experience level. So against these 2-hp rune spiders a 9th level fighter will get nine attacks per round -- exactly like swatting at bugs all over them. 

My friends and I have been playing D&amp;D on and off for 30 years and I can't remember using this rule. If we ever noticed it at all, we've forgotten it. Anyway, this rule is the key to not making this type of encounter a party massacre, and for me it opens up a whole new genre of encounter design and a way to make the players pay attention to very small creatures in the future. 

So has anybody else taken advantage of little-used rules and technicalities to add surprises and variety to their games and wake players up? ",,False,,t5_2qh2s,False,,,True,t3_1h1t6k,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1h1t6k/livening_up_your_game_with_littleknown_rules/,

The GM asks each player 3 questions and the whoever has the best answer per se gets the bonus XP. The questions:

1. What did you learn?
-Typically this is answered in character, but doesn't have to be. The bard in my game recently learned ""I can take advantage of the wizard's womanizing ways for profit."" I award the bonus XP to the player I think had the most profound or funny learning experience.

2. MVP of tonight's session?
-I have each player vote on what player made the session the most fun/memorable etc. The players can't vote for themselves and ties are cool, just give both winners the bonus XP.

3. Mike's Hard Lemonade Award?
-Each player votes for the character in the session that had the worst time of it. Near death, put in prison, conned by another player? All these things could constitute a Mike's Hard award. 

I have found this is a great way to wrap up each session because the players have to reflect on the night's events and recant, laugh about the best parts. My players really enjoy this and it has been a great addition to my games.

I also give bonus XP to my players for doing character sketches of events in the session and painting a mini for use in the game.

Two years ago, my local game store asked me if I could run a D&amp;D game for a little girl who has having a birthday party.  This confused the hell out of me, as I was shocked that there was a 12 year old girl that wanted a D&amp;D themed party, but I was also thrilled that there were still young kids that wanted to game.  So I happily agreed to do it.

I created pre-gens, I made a nice dry erase map, and the day arrived.  Six or seven 10 - 13 year old girls and one boy.  The birthday girl, we'll call her Kay, was so excited that she could show all of her friends this game that she was enjoying with a small gaming group.  As I'm sure you can imagine, not many of the kids were interested.  Kay is a special kid, exceptionally bright and well-read, but her friends were mostly what you would expect from 10 year old girls.  They had little interest in the ideas of roleplaying.  

The first half-hour was me trying to explain to them what roleplaying was.  I tried to keep it light and fun, but I could tell that explaining rules and stats was just going to be a laugh.  

Then I pulled out the dry erase map.  The kids eyes sort of widened as I drew a couple extra details when someone asked 'Can I draw something?'  I was at first fairly resistant, but then an idea struck.  'Sure!'  I gave the first kid a dry erase marker and they put a radioactive symbol in one of the squares.  Then another took the marker and drew a duck in another square.  Each kid took the marker and added something to one square.. we ended up with a pile of underwear, a swamp, a skull &amp; crossbones, etc.  

So I very quickly ditched every plan I had and told them to all put their miniatures at the start spot on the map.  (Where the characters would have ended up appearing if they had gone the original course) and they were each allowed to move their figure 5 squares in the hopes to get to the center of the board (Where there was already a drawn lake, treasure chest, and details of the original game idea) 

All of a sudden instead of a traditional pen and paper, this took on the idea of each of the players for themselves.  It wasn't a party on the hunt for the treasure, it was a bunch of kids on a boardgame scavenger hunt.  Some tried to make a beeline for the game goal where others wanted to hear what crazy things happened when they landed on the squares that they had drawn.  

Along the way, some started looking at their character sheets and figuring out that they had objects and items that they could use, where others asked things like 'since I'm a warrior, can I break this thing?'.

In the end, Kay had a great time because she got to show her friends something that she enjoyed, and her mom was astounded that I figured out how to get a dozen kids to shut the hell up for five minutes and enjoy a game like this.  

My favorite moment of the game came when two girls were at the center area in the lake, both racing for the treasure.  One had missed her swimming check (Most of the checks by this point in time became odds or evens decisions) and was trying to keep afloat while the other had grabbed the treasure chest.  Her friend looked and said, 'I'm drowning, you have to help me!!'

The girl with the chest looked at me and asked if I could, but I told her she would have to put down the chest to save her friend.  She looked at her friend and said, 'Sorry... I got to it first.' and leapt to safety.  Even in a newly formed adventuring party of kids that have never played, there will always be the treasure hound.

A week or two later, Kay's mom called me to thank me profusely and tell me how much her daughter had enjoyed the party - asking if I would consider running an actual game for some kids, as the store's regular DM was taking a break and the mom felt the game might be a bit too adult for Kay.  This was just the beginning of a campaign that is still running to this day....

[Next: D&amp;D 4... ugh.]

**EDIT** Thanks guys - your responses have all been fantastic.  I'll post up the next part tomorrow, which will pretty much include the first 8 - 10 months of the game.. aka the D&amp;D 4 time.

[Original post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/vzi4n/i_have_a_cheater_again/)

Due to the holiday, last night was the first time we played since I posted. I had already asked for his ""final character sheet"" before the game, which he sent to me by email. No problem-- I printed it out and had it at the game.

Then, I asked him to sit next to me because I can't read his dice. When he rolled (using his dice tower, so no ""dice drop"" shenanigans), I tipped my head over, checked his roll, and smiled because he was adding the correct to-hit modifier. Other players at the table rolled onto the table where I could see their dice, and things were just fine. 

Side note: I also roll publicly-- and believe me, there were several rolls I wanted to take back/reroll because my dice luck was so bad last night! I roll in the open because I have a pact with my players in this game-- if I kill their PCs, the PC is dead-dead and can't come back. As a result, I ""play fair"" so that killing them can't be something I just decided to do.

He went along with my insistence on not using the illegal item in my game. I told him (and the other players) how they can get one (kill the other PC and/or steal hers-- this is an evil campaign, after all), but they have to do it while that PC is present (player was absent last night).

He *might* still be cheating with his Fortune Cards-- I didn't track carefully enough last night. But he was more within the bounds of ""good sense"" in other play last night than he has been in the past.

Playing fair, I several times asked other players to hand over their (paper) character sheets so I could read one of their powers and give them a specific ruling (for example ""no, you can't use Oath of Enmity on someone you can't see""). I also reminded one of the players that bursts and blast *can* be used on enemies that you can't see.

At one point, because I had read his powers, I knew that his majestic word also gave temporary hit points. He had forgotten this. When he used the power, I said ""and you give temp hit points."" He kind of looked at me, argued against, and I pointed to the character sheet and said ""it's your second level feat, dude."" At that point, I think he, as a player, realized there was an advantage in letting the DM have your character sheet.

All of this was done without having to confront him yet. We're still in the documentation phase, and I hope that just having more oversight will correct his behavior. Sometimes, just letting a player know that you're paying attention to things will correct the problem.

I have him in my game on Sunday, so we'll see how that goes.

They had spent most of a session in roleplay and trapfinding before having a showdown with a dracolich that the Dragonborn fighter had been chasing the entire campaign. They blew all of their dailies and encounters, fighting off the lich and then entering the final room, where the dragon eggs lay.

Before them, were four of the BBEG's lieutenants. The group, while putting up quite a fight, TPK'd (as I planned). Then, I started some cinematic roleplay. The character that was leaving, a dwarf Avenger, stood up and began to clash with an abnormally strong warrior, who had nearly one shotted several members of the party. The avenger struck a mighty blow but, was ultimately cleaved nearly in half.

Ioun himself came down to take the poor avenger's soul to rest. He offered one boon, and the chance for all of the characters to say goodbye. The avenger wished that all his friends would not die. 

As the goodbyes were said, my wife (who plays a half-elf warlord) burst into tears when describing her goodbye. 

The avenger was taken into Ioun's bosom, while the bad guys set a spell to incinerate the tower. The rest of the party had time to grab one egg each, and jump out of a nearby window. 

I ended the session midair.

The **TL;DR** is at the end.

Yesterday afternoon I was playing a D&amp;D3.5 adventure with my regular group when we got waylaid by a Cyro-Hyrda (a 12-headed Hydra that has fast healing and breathes cold). Each of us got hit once by one of its heads with cones-of-cold; that damage wasn't too bad. Then it got a chance to attack us each once more after the surprise roung. That damage was substantial.

My Brb1/Ftr9 human was our group's only chance. I was the only one with enough hit-points to possibly withstand this creature. Plus, this was the end of the adventure so many of our casters were down to casting *Magic Missile* and other weaker spells only. The situation looked grim.

I decided to move in before I realized that by doing so I'd provoke attacks of opportunities from each of the monster's heads. In other words, I might die before even getting close enough to strike it. 

Not good.

Thankfully my Dwarven cleric friend used his turn to yell out (as a free action) that I still had a potion of enlarge person in my haversack. Brilliant idea! It burned up a turn but by using it I now had a 10' reach so I could strike the creature from where I already stood. *But not until my next turn*. Yet surely the hydra would spread out his attacks on the rest of the group, right? And I could survive a couple of hits. I was raging, after all.

Nope. All of my party members, smartly, had moved a safe distance away on their turns. I was the only member of my party within the hydra's reach when its next turn came up. I ended up taking all of its attacks. Not good. 

See, when I rage my AC is a paltry 18 (I have the *reckless rage* feat). Thankfully, it was blinded because our sorceress had cast *glitterdust* on it. However, wouldn't you know it? The DM rolled extremely well on his miss-chance. Only one attack failed to land. Only one. What are the freakin' odds?

So after that barrage I sustained 122 points of damage just like that. With the damage I'd already taken that was enough to drop me to -10. I was dead.

Or was I? Our Dwarf cleric immediately cast *close wounds* (and instantaneous spell). After his roll I was at -3. Next our Monk/Cleric did the same thing. Suddenly I was at a 7 HP. I was still standing. Still screwed, but still standing.

Before my next turn came I was healed some more: I had about 40 HP by the time it was my turn. Obviously I would be completely fucked if I stayed in the fight. But Crag-Hawks (the name of our party) don't run. Also we were in a bog/swamp, hindering movement. There was no way I could escape without dying and by even trying my companions would surely perish. It would be a total wipe. Maybe if I stood my ground they, at least, could survive.

In the back of my head I was already wondering if this campaign was now over. Without my Barbarian in this particular situation the party didn't have much of a chance. But since running wasn't an option I decided to go all in.

On my turn I boldly declared: **""FULL POWER ATTACK!""**. It was risky, I know. If I missed then what chance did we stand? But if I hit I had to do a ton of damage. My only chance, slight as it might be, was to drop the thing or at least weaken it so much that before it could go again our Ranger could drop it before it had a chance to *fast heal*.

I rolled my first attack: a 6 on the die. Groans around the table. With the -10 TH from the *power attack* that just wasn't good enough. It was a miss. Even the DM, who can be ruthless, looked disappointed. I blew on my die for the second attack (which, as you know, has less of a bonus TH than the first). 

And then, the thing of legends: **Nat 20, baby!**

Fuck yeah. So I definitely hit. But did I crit? I rolled the die again to confirm. The table grew silent. My buddy who plays the Dwarf cleric, sitting to my right, leaned over as the die rolled and rolled.  

It was a 17 on the die. The crit from my greataxe was thus confirmed.

A greataxe does x3 with a crit. Plus I was large now due to the potion so my axe did 3d6 instead of 1d12. After all the multipliers... after the full power attack... after everything was added up and double-checked I had done 125 damage to the beast.

I looked hopefully at the DM. He just shook his head. I asked him, ""Well, how bad does he look?""

""How bad?"" he asked. ""You just cut him in half."" He reached over to the pewter mini of the hydra on the game-mat and turned it over. It was dead.

It's rare to get a crit with a greataxe. The crit-range is 20. Happens only once in a blue moon. But man, what a time for a crit! Definitely saved my character's ass and probably saved the whole group. Also? Probably the most damage I've ever dealt from a single blow ever in D&amp;D. My previous high was 73 from the same character, also on a crit.

Moments like that are why I love role-playing. It comes down to strategy but also the dice. Often you will fail. But when you succeed despite all odds, damn. What an amazing feeling.

Sorry for the wall of text. I just wanted to share with one of my favorite subreddit's the Crag-Hawks' unlikely victory yesterday and inquire of any similar tales. I love this stuff.

**tl;dr**: My Barbarian/Fighter should have died. The group should have been wiped. A risky gamble followed by some very lucky rolls led to a total *fuck yeah!* moment for our group.

You've got a group of adventurers who go together in a little clump to raid some dungeons and slay some dragons in a game that's sort of a magical medieval fantasy. You've got your guy that's great at fighting, a person that's great at magic, and someone that's there to play a flute while the rest of you are trying to kill a dragon. Oh, and a sneaky bastard. And the sneaky bastard? He's stealing from the party. Perhaps things are going missing from your character's inventory when she's awoken after a night's rest. Perhaps when he comes back from “scouting ahead”, all the statues you encounter have empty sockets and fresh scrapes where giant rubies would have conveniently fit. And when you ask Jeff, the player of the sneaky bastard, why the character is stealing from the party, Jeff replies, “That's what my character would do.”

There are a number of ways to deal with this, and I'll lay odds that your group is doing it in the absolute worst way possible: playing it out in game. It's the worst way to deal with it because of two reasons. 

First, you'll never win. Someone at the table will suggest to dice it out: sneaky bastard's player rolls Bluff (or whatever the lying skill is in your game) and you'll roll Sense Motive (or whatever BS-detector skill your game has). When playing a sneaky bastard, Jeff is going to max out their Bluff skill because a big part of being a sneaky bastard is lying to the faces of the opposition to get past them. (Arguably, there's not as many skills that a sneaky bastard needs in D&amp;D/Pathfinder than say, a cleric does.) Your character? Your character doesn't need a big Sense Motive skill because you have a lot of skills that are interesting to your guy. So he rolls a 2 and that's modified to a 40. You roll a 19 and that's modified to a 22. “Ha! You totally believe me,” Jeff gloats. (Which isn't really how that conflict went: your Sense Motive was lower than his Bluff, so Jeff's character didn't give anything away. Your character can still be suspicious of Jeff's.)

The second reason – the real reason why this is the worst way to deal with it – is the problem isn't between characters, it's a problem between players.

(The next worst thing to do is go to the GM with your problems after the game and expect the GM to talk to Jeff about it. Your GM isn't your group's therapist and counselor. You're all peers. You're all human beings.)

So, how to deal this? When Jeff says, “That's what my character would do.” You respond with this: 

“Your character is a dick.”

Now, you've got to immediately follow that up. Don't pause, because your friend at the table is going to think you just said “Jeff, you're a dick.” And that's wrong, because Jeff isn't a dick.

When Jeff says, “That's what my character would do.” You respond with: “Your character is a dick. Look, you, me, we all come together in our limited free time to play a game and have fun. But when your character chooses to steal from the group, it just kills my fun. It just *kills* it.”

What you're doing is having an intervention for Jeff's character. When you're talking about what happens at the table that is upsetting you, you refer to “Jeff's character”, “your character”, or “him”. You never refer to Jeff as the person that's killing fun. It's always Jeff's character.

Give an example:

“You know when we went up against that dragon two weeks ago and Tim's character nearly died? And we used up all those potions? When your character stole from the group, that kept us from selling treasure in town and buying that Spear of Dragon-Slaying the group could have afforded. If we had that, the battle would have been over much quicker and we wouldn't have used up so much other stuff and we wouldn't have had to take Tim's character all the way back to the shrine to keep him from dying. When your character keeps resources from the rest of the group, he's making it harder for the rest of us to complete an adventure – and this is a game where the adventures are supposed to be challenging enough without your character helping the other side. When your character chooses to do stuff like this, it pisses me off. Me. Not my character.”

Look, you have a limited amount of free time. You're in school or you work. You might have relationships outside the game: a family, someone you're dating, another group of friends you hang out with. But with this game, you're devoting an evening or probably a weekend afternoon to gather together and have fun. That's time you could be spending on other activities, but you like the game. You like hanging out with Jeff – he's not a dick. His character, sure. Jeff? No. Why would you spend your valuable free time, weekend after weekend, with someone that's a dick?

Let's wrap this up with suggestions for Jeff. “Well, what do you want me to do? Leave the group?” he might ask. Or he might continue to say, “But that's what my character would do!”

You: “When you decide that your character chooses to do this, it really kills my fun. It murders it. But your character doesn't have to. All he has to do is change his outlook. Change his approach. He just has to realize that when he steals from our characters, it just hurts everyone – including him. Just have him not steal from us or the party. You know what he would do? Not steal from us. If he just does that, he stops ruining my fun at the game.” And if he still doesn't want to change, tell him, “Or your character could leave the group. Because after several months/years of game time that the group has been together, it's not worth having someone all the characters in the group can't trust. I like playing with you, but if your character keeps acting like a dick, I hate playing with him. Eventually he's going to slip up and wind up with one of our swords stuck in his throat. He should change or you should play a character that our characters can depend on.”

When you're playing a long campaign, on average, you're devoting an afternoon or evening of your time together, probably on a weekly basis. Maybe we're talking about 20 hours a month for several months of your time. (And add on the time it takes to get to the gaming location.) It is worth thirty minutes of that to pause and reflect on what you and the others at the table want from the game. You need to take a moment to talk about a social contract: Why are you here at the game? Why are you playing this game? What do you want to see happen in the game? A four-month campaign could take up one hundred hours of your time. That's about a hundred hours that's best not spent being pissed off at others.

(Note: This post was inspired by several recent threads on /r/rpg.)

tl;dr: Talk to your fellow players.

“How I Accidentally Rolled Up Oprah”




I like to stretch myself as a role player. And since, like so many of you fine gents, I’m a socially inept white dude blessed with an amount of body hair that can only be described as a ‘gamer pelt,’ I decided to play a charismatic black lady. She was a bard. Her name was Orva.


Things started out simply enough: a town beset by monsters, a mayor in desperate need of adventurers, and a crew of scruffy locals willing to take up the call. We readied our gear, bid farewell to home and hearth, and set out to face the enemy. But a funny thing happened on the way to the dungeon. Orva began to care. 


At the mouth of the cave, we found a few lazy goblin guards. An easy fight to start things off. The paladin readied for the charge. Our ranger knocked an arrow. Orva cast Charm Person. 


The goblins name was Snert, and he’d had a tough life. Never enough food, abusive older brothers, and a hard scrabble climb to Best Door Guard. He just needed someone to listen. His snot and tears ran down my shoulder.


“Snert, honey. Would you take us to see Boss Toadspit? I bet we can sort this all out.”


He took us to Boss Toadspit. The DM licked his chops. There were 15 goblins and three goblin dogs following us by the time we got to the throne room. Orva couldn’t Charm Person them all. We were about to become puppy chow. 


“Boss Toadspit, you seem pretty upset with the people in Miller’s Ford. Why is that?”


The chief points with his spear. “Talky woman no goblin. Talky woman not speak here.”


I could feel the initiative dice rattling, and Orva was NOT set up for a fight. I had one chance to avoid combat. 


“Orva casts Cultural Adaptation.” The DM’s jaw drops. Who the hell takes Cultural Adaptation? 


“Let me see that sheet.” 


Yup. It was on there. One series of awesome roles later and my buddy Toadspit agrees to meet with the village elders to discuss a truce. Turns out the goblins were pissed about a recent dam drying up their water supply. 


For many levels thereafter the campaign went in the same vein. Orva would charm and face and psychoanalyze, including one particularly adroit use of Beguiling Gift on a Maleficent clone: “Why didn’t you invite me to the party?” demanded the witch.


“That was thoughtless of us. Here’s your invitation. Because you know what I think? I think you're a beautiful person, and you deserve it girl.”


By the time we get to mid levels, Miller’s Ford was a haven for monsters looking to tell their side of the story. And Orva would hold court, listening and sympathizing and offering advice. And if the party grew a bit pudgy from inaction, it was nothing a can-do attitude and a little cardio couldn’t cure. Her eventual success losing the pounds and keeping them off turned into the best seller, “Run Like a Monk, Eat Like a Barbarian.” Orva made bank on that one. 


My fellow party members seemed happy with their new role standing in for Steve from Jerry Springer. And the DM wound up running his first “social” campaign. 


I forget which one of us first mentioned the similarity to Oprah. I think it was around the time Orva started giving away magic items to underprivileged kobolds. After that, it was a short hop to telling audience members in Town Hall to look under their seats for gifts.

You start with a stack 30 or so of terribly-built 1st-level characters, everyone grabs a character sheet, and the DM throws your party of misfits against very-low-CR encounters. When your character dies (which happens quite often), the DM grabs a new character sheet and joins the party, you finish your drink and you become the new DM. And you keep this up until you are too drunk to keep playing and/or you run out of characters.

The redditor who suggested this idea told some crazy stories about almost TPKing to a beached whale or a log over a river (half of the party drowned). Here's a few of the misfit PCs that I remember from his stories:

* A barbarian with high strength and a Con of 4 who is too proud to wear any armor 
* An old granny who fights with a frying pan
* The Wicked Witch of the north-northwest who melts when she comes into contact with water
* Thannibal Lector who fights with a knife and fork and tries to sneak away with the corpses of any dead humanoids that are handy

So this happened some time ago, when my little party of adventurers was looking to aquire some mithril to coat their ship. Small campaign explanation: A huge cataclysm 5000 odd years ago caused the world to be ripped apart, creating a sort of world as seen in Skies of Arcadia (floating, inhabited shards of rock). One small exception is that the cataclysm also created huge clouds of magical miasma, which are unpassable unless you coat your ship in mithril (to absorb the magic powers that would normall tear your ship apart). And of course, the party needs to be in one of these clouds to stop the BBE.

My party found a mithril mine under the effects of a curious disease, which slowly turned the miners into mithril automatons, protecting the mine from intruders. Turns out the mine was the lair of a sleeping mithril dragon and what they had been mining were her eggs. The disease was also spread by her. Mithril dragons normally don't exist in the dnd world, the closest you get is mithral dragons. I  created, in the setting, five mithril dragons, who ""were ancient when the universe came to be"", joking that they had been made by the Creator and were there to enforce his Plan on the world.

Now, this plan also called for this mithril dragon to see her clutch of eggs mined so the party could eventually come there to get mithril for their airships. The mithril dragon took this as normal, as it was part of the Plan, and told the party she would loose her clutch five more times before the end of the universe.

And this is where things kind of went south. The party got enraged by this, not understanding how a plan could force a dragon to create eggs, only to have them mined. They decided the Plan was the vilest thing in existence, that they do not wish to be part of it, and have set of to destroy the Creator and stop this Plan he has made (after they stop the BBE of course).

I am now scared to death walking through empty streets at night, afraid a party of six dnd adventurers will get the jump on me and kill me, thereby putting and end to the Plan...

**EDIT:** Just a small thank you note for giving something to work on if the party would like to continue post current plot (and basically the campaign).

I told him after the attack that it looked like the dog no longer wanted to fight. The player had an idea that since he was a werewolf he could be like an alpha dog and get this dog to submit to him. It was clever, I allowed it and with a few rolls the dog turned to aid him.

The VERY next turn was the pirate captains who pulled out a flintlock pistol and rolled a crit on the werewolf player. Who with zero hesitation declares *I pick up the dog and use it to block the shot!*

The dog died instantly from the attack. I said one of the pirates gawked at him for a moment before saying *Who does that!?*

1367494541.0,157,self.rpg,1djmu6,Our heist is on the verge of becoming a stickup. (Shadowrun),amightyrobot,196,39,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1djmu6/our_heist_is_on_the_verge_of_becoming_a_stickup/,"OK, so one of the guys in our group is running Shadowrun for us, first experience any of us have ever had with the system. 

The team is assembled by a mysterious woman who calls herself Orange. She introduces us to ""Mr. Johnson,"" who tells us about an upcoming, Mafia-sponsored ""charity"" gala. There will be gambling, and lots of high rollers in attendance, which means a safe full of loot by the end of the night.

The team consists of **Mule**, a Dwarf biker and former cage fighter (played by me); **Fury**, a fast-talking Elven conman and Bliss junkie; **Coltrane**, a high-tech Elven drug dealer (and Fury's Bliss supplier); **Hammer**, a human hacker who worships the Norse pantheon; **Grimm**, a Cajun Orc shaman; and **Dom**, a dim-witted Troll day-laborer-turned-Adept.

We check into our hotel across the street from the big event a few days in advance, to case the joint and ensure a smooth in-and-out on the big night. 

Obviously, this is where things start to go awry. Hammer is captured at one point, necessitating a rescue, and three different excursions to the mob-controlled building result in seven or eight dead mooks. I do a hasty, vague frame-up job on the Yakuza (cutting off the dead men's pinkies and carving Kanji characters on their foreheads), but obviously there's going to be increased security for the gala.

The team manages to KO the mob security chief (he's staying in our hotel) and find detailed blueprints and tactical plans in his hotel room. Of course, he saw some of our faces before he went down, so we also hack a suicide note into his comm and purposely OD him on half a bottle of bliss from Coltrane's stash.

So things aren't ideal, but we make it to party night and we know exactly what to expect. Dom waylays a couple on their way to the party and ""liberates"" the RFID chips from inside their palms, allowing Fury to enter through the front door, along with a facechanging mage NPC who's proven very useful so far. Meanwhile, Grimm levitates Coltrane, Hammer and I onto the roof of the building.

Thanks to our previous excursions, we know the ladder on the roof descends down a single shaft straight to a first-floor maintenance closet. From the closet, there's a backdoor to the outside world, and a staircase down to the boiler room. In the boiler room is the safe, a few guards, and two automated turret guns (previously hacked by our team). The idea is, our buddies inside the party let us know when enough credsticks have moved to the safe, I get the two techies down to the boiler room by any means necessary, they hack the (old &amp; outdated) safe, we take the loot and run. Sounds easy, right? Hell, we might even be able to do this without leaving any bodies behind.

Right.

So I creep down the ladder to see if the coast is clear, and naturally the backdoor is open, with two mooks standing just inside it, facing out. Hammer creeps down behind me and hacks one guy's comm, forging a message telling him to get his ass around front pronto. Meanwhile, I crouch in the corner behind them, silenced SMG pointed at their backs just in case. Mook #1 gets the message and tears ass around the side of the building. It's working. Just have to get rid of Mook 2, close and lock the door, and we've got a little time to scope out the area before we have to act later...

And that's when Mook 2 just happens to turn his head. And see a dwarf in a leather duster with an Ingram Smartgun leveled at his chest.

There's no choice to be made here. I perforate the fool before he has a chance to cry out. But now, here we are. I close and lock the door, but someone will want to get in here eventually. The maintenance closet is covered in gore, there's a dead Mafioso at our feet, we have no idea whatsoever what's around the corner and down the stairs, and the only other way out of the room is a fourteen-story ladder.

Still... our ""party crashers"" are armed, and so am I. Dom and Grimm are standing by in case things go south and we need more firepower. And I am just about on the verge of saying ""fuck it,"" going on a kill-crazy rampage, and holding the entire party up for everything they've got. It's not the way our employer saw it going down, but hey - if we get the loot, we get our cut.

Next week, I'll tell you all about how we (presumably) got unceremoniously slaughtered.

Last night, my players fought their fifth or sixth boss fight.  during the battle, three (out of four) of them fell unconscious, though not all at once, and no one actually died.  This is not the first time this has happened.  Two of the players were angry.  One said that my campaign was like playing a video game on hard mode and he wished they could play through once first on easy mode so he knew what was coming.

Most of the battles they get into are relatively easy and none of the player's are in danger of dying.  They beat the hell out of everything but the boss battles I put them against,which I try to make tough, but after each boss battle they complain that all my battles are too difficult.  It's not true, but they get this bottle vision after boss fights and forget how easily they destroyed that band of cultists not an hour ago, etc. 

Honestly, I don't want to run a campaign that involves overpowered characters running through the game with no issues or worries and destroying everything they so much as look at.  So far I've been telling them to suck it up, and if they want to play this game then they will have to work harder to win they would in other campaigns.  I want the game to actually mean something, and I want a sense of accomplishment at the end.  

Part of this is just bitching, I guess, but I want to know: Am I being too hard on my players? Even though I feel like it would compromise the game, should I make it easier to make them happier in the short run? (I feel like if I make it easy, they may like it for a bit, but then feel like they didn't earn it afterwords)

Any advice on what I should do here would be appreciated, or stories of similar situations and you/your DM did.



EDIT: Wow! did not expect this many comments!  Thank you everyone for the advice and ideas!  I've definitely got some ideas for how to make the battles better without, IMO, compromising the game as a whole.

We've been playing in an Eberron campaign since the beginning of summer this year, and we just now hit 10th level, and today's adventure ended with me feeling like an ass.

Our party had ended up in Droaam, having just saved Shae Lorylandar, the Fey Spire in the Eldeen Reaches.  We decide to head to the Great Crag, since its the only city that has anything in Droaam.  It just so happens that thats where my character backstory takes place.  

She's the daughter of a tiefling Venom Lord, who is also the general of the tiefling forces in the hags army.  She helped put together the thieves guild when she was a teenager, and when her father found her out when she was 18, she fled town and started working with House Denieth during the twilight years of the great war.  She's a rogue, in case you couldn't guess.

Her and her party end up meeting up with the remnants of her thieves guild, and hatch a master plan to steal her father's airship and tons of money from his home.  Her two player character party members disguise themselves as tiefling guards and go up and ""relieve"" the guards currently on duty (all this is at night).  My character and her guild sneak into her father's compound and completly clear out his trophy of priceless artifacts and political documents, and then sneak into his room and steal the airship key.  Once we get back into safety, we sift through the loot pile, and find one thing that's valueless, at least too a merchant.

We found a family picture that her father kept of her and her sister, despite her having besmirched his name repeatedly.

Its the first time I've ever felt bad for something my character has done since I started playing.

Finally, I especially want to thank rednightmare for all his wonderful work here. Turns out I made a great decision when I asked illuminatedwax and yellowking if we could ""hire"" him.

I've had several friends express interest in playing tabletop RPGs, and after some prodding I've started up a Pathfinder game. I played D&amp;D 3.5 for several years and wanted to play a system I knew - also that Beginner Box is a godsend.

In any case, I have six people that are all interested in playing. We're all 30+ though, so getting us all together is A) too many people at one time for me as a DM and B) only possible once every 6-8 weeks.

I wouldn't mind taking groups of 2-4 at a time as our schedules allow, but is there a good way to deal with players dropping in and out as their schedules allow? I realize that the ideal situation is the ""weekly gaming group"" (which is how I used to play), but at this point in our collective lives that's not really an option. 

Should I just auto-level everyone's character so that when they come in they're on par with everyone else? Plot-wise it may be hard to reconcile having people pop in and out, especially since it will be a grab bag of who's in or out in any given week.

It should be noted that this is *everyone's* first time playing. Can I make this work or is it just a recipe for disaster? We'd almost be better off playing board games instead, but everyone really, really wants to play D&amp;D (myself included).

Bards

Now, I've always loved bards, ever since they first appeared in AD&amp;D 2nd. I loved that they were jacks-of-all trades, able to do a little of everything. Pathfinder bards are even better. They can wear light armour, heal, have some cool unique spells and buffs and, with the help of a couple of feats to boost their Disable Device, make a serviceable substitute rogue in a group which lacks one.

And yet...

They're still the most despised class, prompting eye-rolling every time anyone mentions playing one.

It's the singing, isn't it?

Singing, or playing an instrument to do your special abilities just feels... dumb. I've always been a bit embarrassed of my bards' singing abilities, always emphasizing other aspects of the characters and glossing over descriptions of song buffs, and I don't think I'm alone in this. Everyone else I've met who likes bards HATES the jestery, merrie minstrel, lute-strumming, Tom-Bombadilllo-do image they're saddled with.  

Lots of people seem to have bards be anachronistic rockers and buffing the party with the power of METAL, but that's a bit silly and meta in its own way.

I know you can have non-singing performances, but lots of their powers do specifically require you to be vocal or visual, and I struggle to come up with rationalizations for the magical effects of other performances.

I can't take full credit for the methods used, I remember coming across a similar tutorial but I lost it. I'll be updating the thread as the tutorial progresses.


[PART ONE: GENERATING LANDMASS](http://i.imgur.com/Y5kStT1.jpg)

**1.** During this stage you will create an image file solely for generating the shapes you will use in the creation of the actual map. Start by creating a large image, in this example my file is 5000 x 5000 pixels at 150 DPI. This file should be considerably larger than the final image will be, because we will be pulling shapes from it in the future. 

Once the file has been created go to FILTER-&gt;RENDER-&gt;CLOUDS.


**2.** You'll notice that the image is now filled with cheesy looking smoke, that's a good thing!


**3.** Now go to IMAGE-&gt;ADJUSTMENTS-&gt;THRESHOLD. This will flatten the clouds into distinct black and white shapes. Push and pull the sliders until you achieve shapes with a decent amount of separation and variation.

**4.** You now have a bunch of shapes that vaguely look like land! You'll be using these from here on out to build a map, so keep this file handy.


[PART TWO: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER](http://i.imgur.com/pWcq9aJ.jpg)

**1.** Create a new file, this will be the actual map so use whatever dimensions suit your fancy.



**2.** On this file, create a new layer and fill with with solid black using the paint bucket.



**3.** Find an appealing shape from the landmass document you created earlier, select it with the lasso tool, and paste it into the new document. Woah! You've got the beginnings of a map now.



**4.** Copy/Paste landmass as you like until you create a map you find satisfying. Try to keep these shapes on separate layers so they can be pushed and pulled as needed. You can also use the paintbrush tool and eraser to fill in/erase any gaps. 



**5.** When you're satisfied with the landmass you've cobbled together, merge the layers into one.



**6.** Voila! You now have a finished continent/island/country.



[PART THREE: MAKING THE CONTOUR](http://i.imgur.com/VxDlbFL.jpg)

**1.** Create a new layer, fill it with white via the paintbucket, then hide it. Go back to the landmass layer and select the magic wand tool. While holding down shift, select each piece of land until the entire mass has been selected.



**2.** Unhide the empty layer. If you have lost your selection, go to SELECTION-&gt;RESELECT.



**3.** Select the lasso tool, right click and select STROKE. A window will appear, giving you a few options regarding the line thickness and color. Two pixels should be thick enough, black will generally suffice as a color.



**4.** Hit OK, and deselect. Congratulations, you now have a contour of your map!



[PART FOUR: COLOR AND TEXTURE](http://i.imgur.com/2l6IL9Y.jpg)

**1.** Create a new layer, this will serve as the background, fill it with a color of your choice. Create a second layer above that one, you'll fill this with LAND COLOR later. Also, move your line layer to the top of the layer stack and set it to MULTIPLY.


**2.** Select the empty LAND COLOR layer and choose SELECT-&gt;RESELECT. Start filling in colors using the paintbrush and paint bucket. The selection will prevent you from coloring outside of the lines so go crazy.


**3.** On the LAND COLOR layer, choose FILTER-&gt;BLUR-&gt;GAUSSIAN BLUR. Push the slider until you have a nice blend of colors. This is your base color.


**4.** Create a new layer on top of LAND COLOR, this will be your DETAILS layer. Make sure your selection is still up. If not, go to SELECT-&gt;RESELECT. Using textured brushes, start filling in the details, add some highlights, etc. 


**5.** Find a high-resolution image of a texture you find appealing, something that resembles parchment or paper, and paste it on a new layer on the top of the layer stack.


**6.** Set this texture layer to COLOR BURN. However, LINEAR BURN and MULTIPLY will also work, albeit producing a slightly different effect.


**7.** Now adjust the layers opacity until you get an even distribution of texture and color.


**8.** BAM! You now have a basic map.

[PART FIVE: LOCATIONS AND TEXT](http://i.imgur.com/wIOSw8n.jpg)

**1.** Create a layer at the top of the stack. Select a round brush at 100% opacity, you will use this to mark to locations of your major cities and settlements. Place your dots on this layer. Of course, if you have some other shape in mind for your dots, feel free to use it.

**2.** After naming your city with the text tool, double click the text layer and select STROKE, choose a line color that separates your text from the background.

**3.** When naming geographic features, it helps to differentiate the text somehow, this can be easily accomplished by bending the text or changing the relationship between the text color/stroke color. To bend text, select the appropriate layer and click the WARP TEXT tool, then select ARC. Adjust the slider until you achieve a slight bend. You should keep the geography in mind, make the text bend so it hugs/complements the landmass.

**4.** Once you've warped the text, select EDIT-&gt;FREE TRANSFORM, now you can move/rotate the text to your liking.


**IN CLOSING:** This should give you a good base to start from. Once you get the hang of it you should be able to finish a map pretty quickly! I'll be out to sea shortly, so I can only answer questions for the next day or so.

1332043975.0,150,self.rpg,r1nux,I got killed by a level one commoner at 9th level. What was your worst gaming mishap? ,always-rolls-a-one,184,34,211,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/r1nux/i_got_killed_by_a_level_one_commoner_at_9th_level/,"To start this is a throw away because I wish to remain some dignity with my main account. If anyone can top this then welcome to the legendary club of sucking at role playing.

I was part of a 3.5 Dragon Lance campaign in college in which I started off playing a 4th level elven wizard. Our party contained two wizards, me, the elf, and a human, a dwarven fighter, a dwarven cleric, and a human ranger. 

The game begins with a one on one session to determine robe color via the Test of High Sorcery. During the test I make a deal with Fistandantilus. For those that are already facepalming at my decision at the time I had read Chronicles a couple years before and vaguely remembered the guy's name when I took the deal. Sweet. More power. How could this possibly come and bite me in the ass? 

Well, I start the game as a white robe due to the fact that my character had been a good person leading up to the test. My alignment begins sliding throughout the game as I side with Fistandantilus and his bargain of power. 

Shit hits the fan while I'm 9th level with access to 6th level spells. 9th level normally has access to 5th level spells, but because I made a deal with the devil I was granted a level higher in return for my health. My hp took a nose dive. 

*To 9 measly points.*

My characters response: Fuck this shit. That bloodstone I found a couple sessions back, yeah I know what I can do with that now. I'm gonna go window shopping for a body that has a constitution score that doesn't suck balls. Thanks, bye. 

I eventually come across a woman chopping firewood behind a cabin in the forest. Chops wood like a boss = good constitution. Not the same race but at least the same gender. Sure, this will do. If I don't like it I can just steal another. Bodies are like shoes to me now.

Bestow Curse was the insta-win spell I prepared earlier to lower the commoner's willpower so I can easily steal her body. The time comes and I get invited into her cabin. There's no one else in the cabin that can mess up with my plan. I'm good to go.

Except I freeze and forget everything I'm supposed to do. As a player I had never done anything so monumentally game changing before. I only had a year's experience playing and never did anything this big. So I enact the bloodstone without casting Bestow Curse first. 

Now, I have to roll a 4 or higher to successfully steal the body and go on my merry way. This is where my username comes into play. I'm known for rolling on the low side. I was actually rolling pretty decently so far and had enough hope that I could pull this off.

Nope.

Roll a 3. Have to roll again to confirm how bad I just fucked up. Roll again.

The entire party leans over to see the result and I clunk my head on the table. You guessed it, a 1. The commoner knocks me unconscious and slits my throat with a knife. Death by level one commoner. Till this day my friends won't let me live this down. 

**TL/DR:** Made a deal with the devil that shot my hp down to 9. Obtained a bloodstone that would enable me to steal a body and didn't use a spell that would have guaranteed me success. Rolled crap and had a first level commoner slit my throat. ",,False,,t5_2qh2s,False,,,True,t3_r1nux,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/r1nux/i_got_killed_by_a_level_one_commoner_at_9th_level/,

I play pathfinder with a group and my boyfriend's character just got shredded by a dragon. (shortly before my character almost died but didn't due to a math error on my part. Phew!) 

Though we're dating in real life our characters have no feelings for each other and their relationship could even be described as tense. She's good, he's evil. They don't understand each other. When our last party member died my character cleaned the body to prepare it for burial and then attended a small burial when they got to the nearest city while the rest of the party shopped. She's good natured and that makes sense. 

I was going to have her clean him up and sew him up (in hopes we can revive him) as well as throw in a small tidbit about a pendant that could create intrigue later. I emailed the DM to ask if he'd be ok with taking a moment at the beginning of our first session to let me drop those one or two paragraphs to explain what happened to the body etc.

I then realized... holy crap, I've never played before, is that even what you're supposed to do when a party member dies? I just kind of took the reins from everyone else and acted as my character would act. What do you do when a party member dies? Do you roleplay any reactions or a service if they choose not to be revived or can't be revived?",,False,,t5_2qh2s,False,,lfg,True,t3_1fldce,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1fldce/when_a_party_member_dies/,

The basic premise is that different people have different expectations about what characters can do. This becomes more prevalent in games that are more open to interpretation of rules (such as Dungeon World, FATE, etc). I also believe that difficulty level coincides with realism of the game world. So for example if you create an extremely epic high fantasy world, you may be able to fight off dozens or hundreds of orcs before falling, whereas in a more gritty difficult world, you could easily die from a small band of orcs. 

Here is my example difficulty scale (WIP):

1 - Very easy. Like playing heroes in an 80s kid's cartoon (ninja turtles, thundercats, etc)

2 - Easy. Like heroes in a PG movie. They may be captured, injured, etc. Very rarely is anyone killed. Mulan, Sword in the Stone, The Hobbit movie, The Princess Bride.

3 - Medium. PG-13. The world can be dangerous, but the players generally are quite epic and can battle swarms of monsters. Somewhat like Lord of the Rings movies or Conan the Barbarian movies, 300 Movie, etc. 

4 - There will be blood. R-rated. Mature themes, serious injuries, death is quite possible. Characters live in a dangerous world. The 13th Warrior, Troy.

5 - Brutal. The Game of Thrones series, Gladiator, etc. Everyone plays for keeps and all bets are off. The good guys live in a perilous world fraught with deadly dangers. Something like a dragon is a nearly insurmountable foe.

I am working on a way to quickly show a scale that tells players ""this is what to expect if you vote for this""

Please let me know your thoughts. I am totally open to discussion on this and would enjoy your feedback. Thanks!",,False,,t5_2qh2s,False,,,True,t3_170gxu,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/170gxu/5_difficulty_levels_and_your_rpg_setting_player/,

I few adventures back, I had a story hook in place as a rumor, that some bandits have been causing disruption of a major trade route, a few miles east of the town they're in. They had taken up residence at an old abandoned keep that's located in a mountain pass, and were falling on traders coming in from the ocean port towards the town.

The town's constable approached them this past game session. ""I have 250 gold to offer if you can take care of these bandits... I know that's not much to you types, so in addition, I'll give you this key that I'm in possession of. It unlocks the gate to the lower levels of this place. No one has been there for many, many years, but legend has it, the place holds great riches. It's all yours to take as a reward, just get rid of these goddamn bandits!""

So, the party heads that way. After the initial skirmish with the group of bandits, they not only keep three of them alive to take back to town for punishment (blew me away... knowing my group, I expected a complete slaughter, haha), but, since the keep itself wasn't actually owned by anyone, they claimed it. Cleared the bandits, claimed the keep the bandits were using. Fuck me. I hadn't thought they'd do that.

So, now my group has a freaking keep for themselves. They're still in the process of clearing out the dungeons beneath it, and of course I'll make sure that they're of the appropriate levels before they can start attracting followers, but they already have plans to try and get a town established around their keep. Smart bastards!

Here's a quick shot I grabbed when they were fighting the bandits: http://i.imgur.com/Vhnfe.jpg",,False,,t5_2qh2s,False,,lfg,True,t3_nhe8k,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/nhe8k/how_my_players_got_a_keep_or_gee_i_didnt_think_of/,

Well at least 7 friends decided to make characters, but only 5 were able to make it to the first session last Sunday, and all I can say is it blew me away how quickly and enthusiastically they jumped right in. After playing a 2-hour session Sunday afternoon, the group eagerly agreed to meet back together after work that night to fight again. In those 2 short encounters, the PCs have all begun to pick up their own unique ""mannerisms"".

The Eladrin mage is in love with using her Phantom Cage, the Human Cleric of Kord takes a swig out of a magical flask that never runs out of liquor, a gift from a generous God (and DM), before crushing his hammer into his nearest enemy, the Elf ranger enjoys using her insanely high perception to investigate every area thoroughly before moving on, the Half-Orc Slayer (named Duurk) charges to the forefront of every battle yelling DUURK! while swinging his axe overhead, and took the full force of a dragon's breath to protect his party members standing behind him. 

And in the best ""RP"" moment of the night, the Dragonborn Paladin noticed a statue of Bahamut in a sideroom, and went to pray before it. At this time, one of the other characters asked to do a perception check of the statue, and they noticed that in place of eyes, the statue bore 2 very valuable precious gems. The group eagerly agreed to pry the gems out, but as they were chatting about how they were going to split up whatever gold they could make from them, the Lawful Good Paladin goes: ""I pull out my sword and shield and stand in front of the statue of Bahamut and say 'If anyone wants to defile the statue they're going to have to fight through me to do it!'"" The group decided it would be best to leave the gems in place (even though the half-orc grumbled about it), and go defile the Moradin statue instead (luckily there aren't any dwarves in the party!).

All in all, it was an amazing experience, and I couldn't have asked for a better first-time DMing.

Tl;dr- my friends, who I expected to give up on D&amp;D within the first session, embraced both the game and the RP aspect far beyond my wildest dreams.

1354215754.0,141,self.rpg,1409or,Deja Vu: How to get double the play-time out of your encounter (x-post from /r/dnd),plki76,184,43,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1409or/deja_vu_how_to_get_double_the_playtime_out_of/,"(Posting this in /r/rpg since it's not specific to just D&amp;D.)

Ran my PCs through this one recently and thought I'd share. :-)

Many campaigns flirt with alternate realities, dream sequences, and/or time travel. All of these are great devices for one of my favorite tricks: the Deja Vu encounter.

Deja Vu encoutners are when you run the PCs through a series of events that they've experienced before, but with a small twist. The major advantage is that you get to save yourself a lot of prep time. My players also (usually :-) ) find this trick fun if it's not overdone since it lets them ""legally metagame"".

So here's what you do. The PCs approach a [dungeon/temple/space ship/whatever]. They are stopped just outside the temple by a barrier and a voice. ""Help me, stalwart adventurers! I am trapped, compelled to act in evil ways. Say my name and free me!""

The PCs will be baffled and probably think this is some kind of riddle. They cannot successfully answer the question. After a few moments of trying the voice will give up in despair and the barrier will go away.

The PCs enter the structure and see a big-bad boss guy guarding whatever Macguffin the PCs are currently seeking. Near the boss is a prisoner of some powerful race (angels are good to use here). The boss monologs for a few moments and calls out ""[Name of prisoner]! Destroy these fools!"". The prisoner reluctantly follows the orders as they are compelled to do and combat begins.

Part of the combat should involve deadly traps that activate on certain squares and stealthed enemies that attack from surprise. This should be a hard battle. If you're doing a dream sequence you can even TPK the party here.

The PCs win or lose and go to get the MacGuffin but something happens. A time flux, they wake up from their dream, whatever. Regardless they find themselves back at a previous point in your campaign. I like to end the session here to give the PCs some time to forget details.

Next week you come back and the PCs are confused as to what exactly happened on that space ship, in that temple, or whatever. They will presumably try to go back and figure it out. When they approach the entrance read the exact same description that you did the first time they encountered the barrier and the voice.

If the PCs are lucky, then they have written down or remember the name of the prisoner. If they've forgotten then play hangman to see if they can remember.

They say the name of the prisoner and enter the structure again. Combat will happen again, but this time the prisoner is on their side, they remember where the traps are, and they know about the stealthed monsters. 

This is especially good way to let the players ""redeem themselves"" if you TPK'd them the first time. With the prisoner on their side and knowledge about the traps and stealthed monsters the PCs should be able to overcome the challenge. If you TPK them again, well then they're just doing it wrong. :-)

Anyway, YMMV, but I find this a fun way to mess with my players and also get double-duty out of an encounter that I create. Please let me know if you use this idea and how it turns out!

  16. Who sees you as a threat to their personal ideology?
  17. What important person did you accidentally kill?  How?  Why don’t they know it was you?
  18. What are you smuggling into and/or out of town?
  19. What is the one important thing you know that nobody else does?

Typically in shadowrun, PCs perform a series of runs at increasing difficulty for 5 figures each. Late campaign missions might run low 6 figure each. PCs spend their gains on a steadily increasing aresenal and treat their fixer like a catalog when it comes time for shopping. Lone Star is a minor factor once the getaway is done.

Why not try it this way. Lone Star as an investigative body is much more threatening. If you leave too many clues you get swat queuing up at your door someday. The payoffs are higher, but equipment is expected to be disposable. The cars, the disguises and especially the guns all go for a swim or get burned when the run is over. Masks and disguises are key and if you get hurt, you take a turn to hit the blood with bleach or something to kill any DNA/ritual link to it. Finally shopping is not catalog based anymore. Well, for items with an easy availability check sure, but specialty items, no. Instead of ""Can you get me 'x' assault rifle in two weeks,"" think more like ""I need some firepower in the next two weeks, see what you can get together."" The fixer then provides something random in that category. Also, periodically the fixer might call up and say, ""Hey, I just got a line on 'X' specialty item, I thought you guys would be interested.

Battle for Wesnoth, apart from being a great turn-based strategy game, also has a very easy to use map editor built-in. These maps can then be opened in a local multiplayer game, screenshotted, and edited for D&amp;D usage! [Here is an example of a battle map I'm using in an upcoming game.](http://i.imgur.com/dEoyy.jpg) (Also, please ignore how bad my map is, it's a first attempt!)

The possibilities are pretty much endless as the maps can be huge in size, subterranean, aquatic, desert, snowy, heavily forested, and even randomly generated. 

My steps were as follows:

-Go to preferences, set keys, scroll down to the screenshot option and select an input, I used Alt+p.

-Make your map.

-Select a multiplayer game, local multiplayer, select the created map and make sure that ""fog of war"" is off.

-Move the starting units to the middle of the map, some place that can be copied and pasted over.

-Alt+p. This will take a screenshot and the game window will show you the save location.

-Find the .bmp file, edit accordingly (I only needed Windows paint), save in your preferred format.

I had this problem once or twice, of course I had to talk to them and say that there is always another way and they don't have to answer or solve those puzzles, there is always at least few another ways, but I'm just interested how did you manage with such situation.

Btw. After this happend I just stopped making riddles, because it was too much time consuming and players wouldn't say something like ""okay, we leave that door with strange inscriptions and just going to get some pickaxes and make our way through the wall, we know it'll last longer, but we don't care, where we can get those pickaxes"" but instead they could just sit and lament about how they don't have any ideas.

1344953522.0,139,self.rpg,y7b9t,Character Quiz,Lineov,179,40,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/y7b9t/character_quiz/,"tl;dr Shamelessly stolen from the Shadowrun Runner's Companion.  I feel that these questions should be asked of EVERY CHARACTER no matter what the system and so I usually have the players come to me with this filled out before starting a campaign.  

Questions 8 and 13 are by far my favorites to read players answers for.

1)	We are shaped by our heritage. Facial features, skin tone, height, build, metatype, even aptitudes are influenced by the genes passed from parent to child. Attitude, too, is taught by parents, informed by their own lives and their cultural heritage. Where does your character come from, what is her lineage, who were her parents, and what did she inherit from them?

2)  Parents can be proud of their children or regret ever bringing them into the world. Some are loving, and some are indifferent.  All of them are only metahuman and have their own opinions of their children. Assuming they could speak, what would each of your character’s parents say about her? (Note:  Do not feel the need to answer in the first person. Also, if your famility is huge, feel free to include the whole family, and heritage)

3)  Very few people choose to become shadowrunners (adventurers). More likely, they are thrown into the life by a chaotic and uncaring world. Even if she made a conscious decision to enter the shadows, her decision is influenced by the world around her.  How did your character get into shadowrunning, and why did she take that path?

4)  People have control over their own living arrangements. From the child young enough to use crayons and tape all the way up to the elderly shut-in who plasters her walls with family photos and cat pictures, everyone makes their living spaces more personally pleasing. What is your character’s living space like, and what has he added or changed to make it his own?

5)  Everyone has beliefs, and many have beliefs strong enough to be convictions. Some are religious, some are political, some are social, and some are just about why people are here. What does your character believe in, what are her convictions (if any), and why does she hold them?

6)  Everyone has aspects of their personality that grate on someone.  Even the best of friends annoy one another from time to time.  The flaws in a person’s character are as important as the qualities.  What do you dislike most about your character’s personality?  

7) People make acquaintances and friends; we’re hardwired for it. Humans are social animals. This is especially true in the shadows, where often it is not the power you have, but the power you can borrow, and not who you, are but who you know. There’s a story behind each and every one of these relationships. What is the story with your character and her contacts?

8) It’s Saturday morning, and your character has no commitments until tomorrow afternoon. What does she do for the day?	

9) Your character has a specific skill set, a list of Active and Knowledge skills that define what she knows and her areas of expertise. How did she come to learn those skills, and how did she develop them to those levels?

10)  Everyone has their limits. People can be dark, but most people’s instinct is to draw the line at certain actions and thoughts, and they keep to their own moral convictions. Is there a moral limit that your character enforces on the jobs she takes, and in what shadow work would she refuse to engage?

11)  If you have an Awakened (magical) character, consider your character’s tradition and streams. Even within the major established magical traditions, there is room for personalization. Ask yourself what drew her to that particular paradigm, how does it effect the way she views the world and her magic, how does it translate into choice of mentor spirit, and how does it affect the appearance of the spirits or sprites you conjure?  If she is not awakened (or perhaps has a lantent awakening power), how does your character feel about magic, and the magic communities?

12)   Life as a shadowrunner is by definition outside the bounds of “normal” life. Shadowrunners do not truly fit into the lives of ordinary people, whether they live in slums or mansions. What does your character think of ordinary life, mainstream culture, and those who abide by it? 

13)   Everyone has nightmares. Sometimes, we forget the dream completely on waking. Sometimes, the nightmare haunts us or even recurs. If your character had a lingering nightmare or a deep-rooted fear, what would it be, and why does he find it so terrifying?

14)   People tend to attach sentimental value to items in their possession or people they are close to. They make an effort to keep these close by and safe. What is your character’s “sacred object” or “close one,” and how did they come to be so important to him?

15)   One of metahumanity’s greatest assets is its ability to look toward the future and imagine a better life. Even small children have dreams about what they want to be when they grow up.  What did your character want to become when he was a child, and what are his goals now?

16) A person’s appearance can say volumes about him. From fashion sense, to the colors he prefers, to the way he walks and speaks.  Sometimes, his personality determines his appearance, and, sometimes, the appearance he chooses to present the world effects his personality. What does your character look like, and what inspired his choices?

17)  Everyone has a name, but a runner’s street name is a representation of his connection to the shadows. Sometimes runners choose their own moniker, but more often it is given to them as a nickname or earned through some (mis)adventure. How did your character come to be known by his street name? (Note:  Any character who goes by a decently well described alias, or perhaps has an interesting real name with some background of its own, will possilby start with more notoriety, or at least be able to swing said name for some barganing gusto in certain situations)

After the goblin ""released the hounds"" (who were summarily defeated) the fighter offered the goblin the opportunity to surrender.  The goblin did, and in a surprising show of goblin dignity asked in goblin ""for a clean death.""  The fighter, who did actually speak goblin was impressed with the little guy's courage and thusly offered to take him on as a squire of sorts.

I wasn't sure as a GM if this was a good plan, but we went along with it anyway and I let him take the goblin as a cohort.  We rolled randomly for stats, and lo and behold the little green guy got an 18 for charisma!  

Throughout the course of the campaign, the goblin (whose name was Meerg) was taught to speak common and given both a set of nice clothes and powdered wig as well as a set of armour made of discarded kitchen implements.  He carried around a bag of holding filled with potions and ran around acting as a ""combat medic"" by doling out heals and buffs as needed.  He always had a joke and learned how to play percussion on his pots and pans for an occasional bard buff or entertainment around the campfire.

Did it give the players a bit of un unfair advantage?  Sure!  Are we still talking and laughing about the exploits of our goblin combat medic 5 years later?  You know it!  Meerg was awesome, and he's sorely missed.

(Note - I got the name and the character from a piece of goblin graffitti written on one of the walls in the dungeon they were navigating that simply said - written in poo - ""Meerg wuz heer."")

What is everyone's experience with players playing the opposite gender?

It has been my observation that women are much more likely to play androgynous or ""mystery gendered"", or male characters, than men are to play any sort of ambiguous gender or female characters.

I just wonder is this stereotypical? Are women more comfortable crossing gender boundaries through fantasy gaming? Is this an anomaly that I just happen to run into regularly?

Personally I have one female friend who only plays androgynous or male characters and occasionally transgendered, yet never female in any RPG we play which never fails to make her husband a bit uncomfortable. Games I play in at my FLGS usually has people who drift in and out, and I have noted that roughly every third character a female plays is male, at least in that setting. Yet the reverse, in my experience, is not even close to that. I've only ever once been in a game where a male has played a female character; aside from the GM roleplaying various NPCs.

It is a curious subject. The spark for this post is due to the group over at http://www.youtube.com/user/DawnforgedCast?feature=watch the new season of Monday Night Gaming is up and the female in the group is playing a male character. There are two females in a Pathfinder game I play weekly at my FLGS that are playing male characters, and the home game I am running my friend is playing a male character.

The best one I've ever had was in a game of D&amp;D 3.5e that I ran. The PCs were slightly careless in crawling this dungeon, and found themselves face-to-face with a fiendish behir, in its lair.

For those unfamiliar with [behirs](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/behir.htm), they get loads of attacks, and if they hit you they can grapple you, and if they grapple you they can swallow you, and if they swallow you then they can digest you. The party quickly found itself in over its head, and the rogue went down the beast's gullet. He had already used up all his healing potions, and rest of the party knew that he probably wouldn't last another round.

The paladin's player turned to me and asked, ""Do you think I could get swallowed by that thing, too?"" I figured that if he was offering himself up, the behir wouldn't say no to another tasty snack, so he basically dove into the creature's open mouth.

Keep in mind that the paladin had already taken a serious beating from this battle, and wasn't doing so hot. But without even a second thought, he leapt into the behir's jaws and laid hands on the rogue, healing him. The rogue, so healed, tried desperately to hack his way out, but he couldn't do enough damage, and that round, the paladin succumbed to the behir's stomach acid.

The next round, the rogue cut free and killed the behir, and the rest of the party was saved. If the paladin hadn't healed the rogue, the rogue would have died.

I've been behind the screen for about 10 years now, and I've never seen such a heroic act of self-sacrifice. The paladin player had been playing his character for about six months; he brought him up from 5th level to 9th. He played his character to the hilt, even when playing his character meant sacrificing himself for his comrade.

The part that I found most moving was that the paladin and rogue weren't best friends or anything - the rogue had trust issues, and was constantly getting involved in little escapades of which the paladin did not approve. But when it came time, the paladin did what needed to be done.

The other players offered to have him resurrected, but the paladin player said that they should save their diamond dust for someone needier than him.

This was a year ago, and call me a sap, but I still tear up a little thinking about it.

As i am writing this it is 12:40 at night and I am still terrified from my last game of DREAD. For those of you not in the know DREAD is a horror roleplaying game, built around the use of a jenga tower for tension. You pull out pieces to perform actions, knock it over and you die. Some critique it for being too easy to die, but I played it and we didn't knock the tower over until the very end! (We slowly became Jenga masters). We played it in the den of the GM, he turned most of the lights off and had ambient horror music playing and it was terrifing. The tension that was created by the Jenga tower was so immense I physically felt the emotional tension in the room. If you have a solid group of friends and are playing late at night, DREAD can be a place for some good scares

TL;DR DREAD is terrifying and cool and totally worth playing...
im still so scared now

1330437792.0,137,self.rpg,q9ogh,Let's talk non-combat encounters!,,165,28,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/q9ogh/lets_talk_noncombat_encounters/,"So, I'm DMing a semi-sandbox campaign at the moment, and players travel a lot. Sometimes I am able to come up with interesting encounters on the fly, but sometimes I feel that game stalls a little. So I decided to come up with some encounters, that I can use whenever my ability to improvise fails me. 

Of course, I throw in a group of bandits or monster here and there, when it's appropriate, but that not what I want to talk about. I want to talk about the kind of encounters, when players have a chance to do more role playing instead of roll playing, encounters that make the world more real and remind players that they main quest is not the only thing happens in the world.

Basically, just small stuff that adds flavor to the game.

I've come up with a few encounters already, but I think  we can come up with a lot more stuff together, and It will hopefully be useful to a lot of Masters. 

I try to keep it system-indifferent, so more people could use it. Some of this, is, of course setting-specific, but I think can be adopted easily. I try to come up with one or two possible interactions with encounter, but of course it can bu just purely flavor-type of thing, or something completely different.

So, a few encounters I've come up so far:

**On the road:**

* Bounty hunters: party meets a group of tough bounty hunters with a few captives. They can just pass by, if engaged in talk might tell party about situation in the region, tell them a story behind their prisoners. Party might try to free them if they feel that the prisoners were wronged, so it can escalate to combat. Or not.

* Traveling circus: lots of exotic animals, acrobats, magician, common workers, merchant- or, on the contrary, artist-type owner of the circus. A lot of situations can be derived from here - party druid sees animals mistreated?  Party might want to join in with their next performance to make extra coin?  Gypsy-type oracle traveling with the circus might provide an insight about their quest or tell the party about mythical treasure.  Owner of the circus might want an exotic animal added to his collection, or to track down an animal that escaped? Lots of possibilities here. Can easily be a start for a whole side-quest line.

* Pilgrims: group of pilgrims, traveling to visit a relic of their faith. Party might want to escort them to the nearest town, or maybe even go and see the relic themselves.

* Celebrity bard: traveling star, with bodyguards and bunch of people attending to his needs. Arrogant and spoiled. Or, on the contrary, surprisingly helpful and modest. Party can later meet him at some Lord's feast. Gives a good sense of continuity in the world. 

**In the city:**

* Prize fighter: A crier at the market square challenges anyone to a staff combat (soft, non-lethal kind of staves) on a beam with an agile fighter. The one to fall down loses. The fee for the challenger is something like 10 gp in D&amp;D prices, if he wins he gets 50 gp. The fighter is weaker then party fighter-types (lower level in case on D&amp;D), but heavily specialized in what he does. Maybe they work with some thieves that cut purses in the crowd while people stare at the fight.

**In the wilderness:**

* Abandoned village: lots of empty houses, plants starting to win over everything. Why did everyone left? Bad soil? Constant bandit raids? Something even more sinister? Maybe there's a clue in the village, maybe it's something party will want to investigate? Maybe they will learn the truth themselves, or hear a story about this village later on, or even meet someone who used to live there? Or maybe it will just remain a mystery. 


Ok, English is hard, hope I didn't fuck up to much. Sorry if there are some unforgivable mistakes.

I'll try to add some encounters in the comments later on. 

**And of course, share your non-combat/flavor encounter ideas!**

Edit: lots of great ideas guys! Don't forget to tell us about some of good encounters you were engaged in as players too!

Early into the campaign (around probably levels 2-3) one of my friends playing had decided that he was going to complain, bitch, and whine until I would give him a magic item/weapon.     

I told him time after time that he was too low level, that I wasn't going to give him one and no one else, et cetera... but he wouldn't quit making little snide comments on the subject. I wasn't going to kick him out of the group, he was a good friend of mine (more of that friend that annoys everyone, but is OUR annoying friend) So I began to form my plan...     

After a small encounter with a group of kobolds, the player discovered a small ring amongst the loot. I had him roll to detect magic on it and he discovered that the ring was enchanted with an unlimited amount of magic missile charges and could be casted as a normal spell, which leveled alongside his character's level. He was ecstatic and it became a key part of his character, in combat and out of combat.   

Little did he know (though his fellow party members were well aware) the magic ring was actually cursed. It caused the wielder to hallucinate that he was casting magic missiles from it, but everyone else around him would just see him pointing it at enemies. I even let him roll for imaginary damage.   

This campaign lasted for about half a year and I didn't inform him in on the ring's true purpose until it was near it's end. He actually thought it was hilarious and finally understood why everyone snickered whenever he used it. This has since stuck with all of us whenever we talk about it or play and we still burst out laughing over it.  

tl;dr: I gave one of my whiny PC/friends a ""magic"" ring that he thought shot magic missiles, yet it really did nothing but make his character look like an idiot.",,False,,t5_2qh2s,False,,,True,t3_fazvh,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/fazvh/dd_ring_of_infinite_magic_missile/,

I asked that nobody downvote anything, but nearly every single game listed had at least one. So to counter this, I have sorted the data primarily by the *actual* number of upvotes. *Then* I used the final score column as the secondary sort order. That way if two games got 10 upvotes, but one got 1 downvote, and the other got 3 downvotes, then the one with fewer downvotes would be ranked first. That's probably the fairest I can be.

I didn't include any games that only got one vote, and I disqualified a couple that weren't in print (one, for example was just a kickstarter project).

There were comments about how Reddit auto-adjusts posts by adding and subtracting upvotes, but as far as I can tell, this does not affect comments -- it's only done to topics.

It takes 1.2 million gallons to flood a kilometer squared. That's 600'000 casts of create water, all consumed. Earth has 510 million square to cover. It would take roughly 306 trillion casts of consumed created water to flood the world in urine. 

Eventually this is the logical final end of a DnD world... could make for a weird campaign. 

Edit: wow RPG front page! The square kilometer was to flood said area or math wise raise water by 20 meters. 

Assuming oceans and water pressure you are correct it would be much more, but since the math accounts for 20 meter flood on land it's roughly raising the ocean by 2.6 meters. Which would still water world the world.

As for the time. Well that would be 1 first level caster, drinking 2 gallons of water a day. Since in my games people tend to always use create water, I began thinking long term. 

If you have 4 billion people all drinking created water. It would only take 5 years to create this scenario.

Yes purified water, the natural conversion of urine to mineral and salt water would indeed make the world not flood in pee. However the entire reason the water levels would rise is due to that bodily process, over time.

Thanks for all the responses/advice. Sorry I can't reply to it all, I only have my phone to access the internet at the moment. Just a few distinctions i want to make. The Dragonborn Paladin dosen't know the thief. They are in seperate games! I play the paladin in the game with the thief! Also the thief dosen't steal items off of the other PCs rather he just steals more than his fair share of the loot.

So I have been playing D&amp;D 4e with a group of close friends for about a year now. Our original DM got us into it, with a couple of us (myself included) having wanted to play for a while. In the campaign he is running one of our PCs is a halfling rouge who in his backstory is a thief (The other members of the party are; Eladrin Wizard [the metagamer] , Dwarf Cleric of Bahamut, Human Fighter, Human Ranger and my character a Human Paladin of Ioun). 
Anyway, the player who plays as the thief likes to get into the character. At first (as a newbie gamer) it used to bug me that his character would often steal much of the loot from under our characters noses. Occasionally I would roll perception or insight to see if my char could catch him in the act (this to some may seem like metagaming. But my char is aware that he is a thief and will therefore hold some suspicions towards him, especially as a a paladin). Needless to say my checks were always way too low to match his insane thievery, and on the occasion my char confronted him face to face the halfling's bluff was way to high anyway. Anyway, after the DM had a quiet chat with him he toned down his thieving to just getting slightly more than his fair share of the gold. Most of the party were happy with this conclusion. Myself included.
 
However, one member of the party continues to be adamantly against him stealing the loot (despite the fact he no longer steals a significant amount and he is just roleplaying his character). This player continues to metagame to prevent the thief from stealing ANYTHING. The metagaming has gotten so bad that it has spilled over into the campaign I run (sidenote: I started running this game so that our regular DM could have a chance at playing as a PC, so that a couple of different friends could play, and so I could further my understanding of the rules).

In the campaign I run the player who plays the thief in the other game is a Tiefling Bard. The metagamer is playing a Dragonborn Paladin (note in the players handbook 1 pg35 it states &gt; To a dragonborn, honor is more important than life itself.). In my campaign the metagamer has repeatedly tried to cause harm to the bard (for no apparent reason). Furthermore when I added a magical item in the loot of a tomb for the bard the DRAGONBORN PALADIN attempted to steal it from under his nose, justifying his actions by saying "" 'R' keeps stealing in the other campaign"" (I should also say I had scattered magic items throughout the dunegon for all the party). 

I'm kind of at the end of my tether with this metagaming. I've called him out a number of times to try and stay in character. I'm not super anal about staying in character and I allow a small amount of metagaming in encounters (like if the party want to BRIEFLY discuss tactics). But his metagaming is sort of killing the fun for me as a DM and is unfair on the player playing the thief because he actually took the time to come up with a backstory (something the metagamer has failed to do for both campaigns). Does anyone in /r/rpg have any idea what I can do to encourage him to stop?/have suitable punishments for him? I wouldn't consider kicking him out because he is a very close friend and it's only really three members of the group that are fed up of the metagaming (Me, the other DM and 'R', the others dont mind because it dosen't affect their PCs). I've already had a pretty blunt talk with him but he fails to see the error of his ways. Any advice or tips from other players especially DMs would be really helpful.
Thanks!

Tl:dr How can a DM deal with a metagamer without kicking him out the game?

EDIT:
So the feedback I am getting is:

- Talk to him again in private

- Talk to the other players and DM

- Get 'R' and him to talk out their differences over the table with myself and the other DM present

- If his behaviour persists dock his exp or strip him of his paladin powers

- threaten to kick him out the game

- actually kick him out the game

1323973595.0,127,self.rpg,ne1yw,DM Tips: Poker facing and false tells. ,GerardHopkins,152,25,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/ne1yw/dm_tips_poker_facing_and_false_tells/,"A substantial portion or r/rpg content is new DM questions and I haven’t done a Dm tip in a while so here’s some to keep your players guessing

**The fake roll**

An old classic DM tactic is the fake roll; this works especially well with a DM screen.  Occasionally a DM roll a d20 or a d%  and “inspect” the result.  The result doesn’t matter.  The idea is that when you have an npc making sneak checks or want to see what wondering monsters are there the players do not go on red alert because “stuff is happening” that their characters are not aware of.  If you have periodic roles which never result in any actual changes the group will not be suspicious when you are rolling to set up a scenario.

**Poker face**

Whenever possible it is best to maintain a disposition that doesn’t tell the players if what they have just done is good or bad, unless you specifically want to add dramatic effect.  When the players are about to descend the old dry rotted rope into a well with oozes at the bottom, before checking if the rope would hold them, try not to smile.  Your tell, evil grin or other, may make them wary of the predicament you’ve constructed and if they learn your tell they will avoid all your designs and hard work as if by some divine intervention.  More than your disappointment, players will enjoy a game more when they are surprised and challenged. 

**The false tell**

You cannot always hide your tells.  As DM’s we become just as invested in a session as the players do.  Give a false tell once in a while so that they really don’t know what’s going on behind your screen and what hellish plans you are jotting down.  Tells can also give away what’s an intentional plot device and what’s changed because the players are wandering off the path you are luring them down.  Because I pause and maybe even stumble on descriptions that I am forced to create on the fly I will sometimes purposefully pause and stumble on devices that I have deliberately and intricately laid out a month in advance.  If the player thinks they are charting a new path in your game but is actually still caught by the adventure hook you’ve set they will be that much more surprised when you lay out a well develop scenario or challenge for them that meshes perfectly with the path they are on.




**Tl;DR** Keep your players from knowing when you are making a crucial roll or when they are falling into your traps.  Adventure hooks are more effective and brilliant when they catch the players as well as the characters.


Edit:  [As stated by dboates, you shouldn't have to lie to your players.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/ne1yw/dm_tips_poker_facing_and_false_tells/c38cnmo)  I agree and think that all these tactics can be used without stating a falsehood.  However, by all means lie to the characters if it helps the game.

Edit 2: [FumbledAgain](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/ne1yw/dm_tips_poker_facing_and_false_tells/c38gui1) brings up another point i'll clarify here.  These tactics are not meant to mess with players heads but do the exact opposite.  If the DM is always exhibiting certain behaviors players cannot metagame something that is happening or about to based on the DM's behavior.  These tactics are meant to kill the players tendency to meta game so they can focus on the RP part of playing.

I recommend you play around with it for a little while before you continue reading.

__WHY AM I POSTING THIS HERE?__

Besides the goodness of my heart (which is in the 96th percentile of heart goodnesses), I also have a plea. Be creative, and then let me sup on your sweet creativity juices. If we work together, both of us make it out alive.

Simply put, I would like more systems to include. That means I'm looking for two things: First, ideas for systems that would work well in this generator (cash equivalency 0.00002c), and completed systems in the generator (cash equivalency 0.002c). Directions on how to create systems are included in the ""DIRECTIONS!"" sheet.

__WHAT SYSTEMS CAN BE MADE?__

Passive voice, eh? Well, I'll indulge you. This generator is designed for systems where characters have __low cohesion.__ This means: You can have classes (fighter or wizard) and weapons (sword and staff), but you can't really _require_ a wizard to use a staff. This is because most values are generated independently. For this reason and others, it's not well suited for systems that require synergy to work. It's also not good for ""serious"" systems with min/maxing and harsh death rules - play it light.

However, as it involves so little player interaction in the character creation process, it is _great_ for other games: A game in which you don't choose what you play, you play what you get. I've found that since I have no (or low) input in character creation, I end up with something I wouldn't have built on my own, and thus get a more interesting roleplay experience. Of course, everyone in the group is under the same limitation.

__HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CREATE?__

Assuming you follow the doc's directions about copying existing sheets and modifying them, not too long. The longest facet of character generation comes if you decide to make giant lists of special qualities and include balanced stat mods with them (scroll to the bottom of GnomesQualities or InspectorQualities to see what I mean). To give an example, I made the Dance of Water and Flames RPG in 1 hour, to see how far I got. I got down stats, rank, armor and powers but was unable to include my other ideas, like favorite food and religion. Obviously I knew what I was doing with respect to the technology involved, but I still had to think of everything.

__TO SUM UP__

So, just as a reminder:

 * Play around with the system and give me feedback!

 * Create new RPGs or RPG ideas (and give them to me :D)

 * The entire generator is based off of an existing RPG (with compatible character generation) that should be obvious to anybody familiar. Bonus 0.02c to those that identify it below.

The thing is, in the show, they fight all the time, but death is not the most common resolution. Instead, they're usually fighting over some objective, and killing the other person is not the only or even the easiest way to accomplish it. If they are just fighting for the sake of it, someone usually knows they're beaten and surrenders or is subdued before a lethal blow is struck.

The result of this is that fighting, in the show, is a story event in which success and failure drive the story along, which is enormously cooler than the victory/death dichotomy that RPG combat seems to embody. I've played lots of D&amp;D, some White Wolf games, and a little bit of Mutants and Masterminds, and in every case it seems like the easiest, or even only, way to win a fight is to outright murder your opponent. Even if you're fighting over some objective, the most likely solution is to ignore that objective until the other guy is dead and then go take care of it unmolested. And I really wish that weren't the case.

Have you, my fellow redditors, experienced this at all? If so, how do you deal with it? Do you have a system that makes combat into a story point rather than a save or die, or have you altered a system to suit your purposes?

Today was the second game in a new campaign our group has started recently. I'm not going to call this group powergamers, but they love making strong characters and getting phat loot. 

The first quest they were tasked with was to stop a bunch of giants that were throwing molten boulders at the wall of the starting town. This was going to be a mostly combat mission so the players could get comfortable with their new characters and get to the real roleplay back in town.

At the end of the second session, I realized that I had forgotten to give the players loot or experience for 3 encounters. Then I realized: my players hadn't asked about loot or experience for three encounters over two sessions. I had them so wrapped up in the bugbears trying to dig through the wall, the subterfuge happening in the goblin's forward base, the negotiations with a Hobgoblin commander, and even the inter-party bantering and arguing (civil arguing, mind you) that they had totally forgotten to ask for loot.

Someone is being mean, how do I stop them?

Someone often doesn't show up for RP and it's a problem. What do I do about it?

One of the players is always being greedy and tries to hog the limelight/treasure. What should I do?

I don't like the people in my RP group, what should I do?

Seriously, I don't understand why these things are so hard. If you had these problems at your weekly poker game or quilting group or judo meetup, you'd respond by talking to the person and asking them to change. If you don't like the group, you leave. If someone's disruptive, don't invite them.

Why do RPers keep having to post these same questions here? Is it because the old idea that RPers are socially inept has some truth to it? I'm not trolling here, I really want to know. 95% of these problems are perfectly solvable by any socially competent adult, and I don't understand why they keep coming up.

The first problem was that I completely forgot how to use character sheets to create a character. So I trashed the ones I printed and went on my desktop and used the character creator 'quick character' and asked them what they wanted to be. Once that was over, we tried to begin learning. It exploded. I thought I knew what I was doing, but I didn't know much. Do you do movement in the dungeon or in dialog with the the players? was my first question I thought.

Just Easier,The_Unreal,162,34,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1h56bp/rules_support_doesnt_make_roleplaying_better_just/,"tl;dr: Rules support for roleplaying doesn't improve the quality of your roleplaying just because there are rules available.  Well defined characters are what make the difference, and many of the ""RP heavy"" systems simply force you to define who your characters are as people - but there are always trade-offs.


-----------------------------------------------------

Recently I've seen a rash of posts and comments about which game system to use and why.  Pathfinder, DnD, Dungeon World, Fate, and many others are thrown around and their various features and virtues extolled (or derided, as the case may be).  In all of this chatter, I think we've overlooked an obvious point that's distorted our discussions of late.

A common topic is roleplaying (hereafter, RP) and which system does it best.  My argument to you is that in truth, the question itself is flawed.  You have to decide to RP, and it gets better or worse with the degree to which you commit to doing it.  All that rules systems that ""support"" RP do is provide you with tricks and incentives to do it beyond your intrinsic desire for story and immersion ... which usually make up the bulk of why people do it in the first place.

Let's take Fate for example.  Characters are assembled using aspects, which are short phrases like ""All deals are final!""  The GM can then compel someone to do something (e.g., not go back on an agreement, thereby doing something foolish) based on that aspect, or else they must expend some of the game's currency.  On the flip side, doing the thing introduces a story complication, but gives the player currency to use on influencing some outcome.  It's a neat mechanic, and it works well, but does it make your RP better?

By itself?  Hell no.

But many people do notice a difference.  Let's talk about why that is by comparing it to Pathfinder (PF).  PF, by contrast, is a very crunchy system.  While Fate tries to model the imperatives of dramatic fiction, PF tries to model the physics of combat while providing a metaphor for resolving conflict.  Characters are built based on their physical and mental attributes (core stats), and then their competencies (via skills) and intrinsic traits (via class features and feats).  Notice that their beliefs and motivations are never mentioned.  All of that is left to the player, and many players choose to ignore that ... and then complain that PF is bad at RP.

In reality, Fate won't let you play the game at all unless your motivations and internal drives are laid bare for everyone (most importantly the player) to see.  Because people are prone to behave in a manner consistent with their stated beliefs (I could cite literature here, but read the relevant chapter in Influence by Cialdini for more) they RP naturally.  But this comes at a cost.  

In a way, compels of aspects can actually degrade player agency.  It's sort of ""forced"" RP.  You're offered choices, but without knowing for sure if you'll need that fate point later, are you really making a meaningful choice?  You can't know what refusing to go along with your pushy GM's prodding will cost you.  And what if he's not using your aspect like you think it should be used?  To be clear, there's nothing wrong with Fate per se.  But it's not what makes your RP experience satisfying.

What makes for a good RP experience, is defining an interesting adventurer and then acting in accordance with their drives and passions.  Fate forces this, PF just allows it.  If you're playing with people that need to be conned into RPing, that's fine and well, but what if you're not?  I'm not sure the potential hit to player agency is worth it, unless you get something else as well.

Other systems offer specific, circumscribed rewards (like XP) for RP activity, but GMs can do this in any system.  The bottom line for me is that you should play the system that feels right for you.  Roleplaying can happen anywhere, any time you follow the basic rules of improv and create a real character rather than a stat block with legs and a name.  Fate and Dresden are grand, but they're not going to offer you a way to adjudicate the nuances of combat in a way many find satisfying.  They sure as hell will force everyone to decide up front exactly what kind of person they're playing.

The pyro would make it very clear that he didn't like my knight, didn't trust her, etc. Passing notes to the DM in front of everyone. My character ended up adding a bucket list, with #2 on the list being ""find some way to push that sociopathic mage into a fire without getting caught.""

We get into the cult's temple and find our way to Victor. He's possessed by some uber evil, as is usually the case. It turns into a fight, but the mage decides to heal evil Victor instead of hurting him. He wants the power that Victor claimed to have. Pyro then turns on adjacent the shaman and casts sleep on her. He fails horribly. The shaman is gobsmacked by the betrayal, and attacks the pyro. Whack, whack, pyro is almost dead. Shaman spends an action point, whack, pyro is unconscious. My knight decides this is the best time to work on that bucket list. She grabs the pyro, drags him away from the fight to a campfire burning nearby, dumps his unconscious body in it, and wanders back to the fight.

All of the other PCs drew three cards, every one of them managed to draw at least one negative card. As we each had one redraw available, some managed to use it to get rid of their negative card, others got stuck with it, or drew another shitty card.   

The first card I drew? The Courtesan. The character's favourite item becomes intelligent. My PC has carried his father's sword since the beginning of the campaign, when it was just a masterwork weapon. By now, it's a +2 Keen, Ghost Touch longsword (a pretty decent weapon in itself,) and after drawing the card, is now intelligent, communicates telepathically with its owner, has blindsense, can fly (presumably, allows the wielder to fly) and gives a +2 bonus to attacks/saves/checks when used in defense of the noble house he belongs to. Amusingly, he already had an intelligent sword (an artifact the group had recovered,) so now he has two. Even more amusingly, his family's sword is smarter and has a higher Ego score.

And then, the second card. The Empty Throne. This is an earlier version of the deck than the one linked above, so it actually provides 25,000gp and a noble title. As he's already a member of a noble house, the title is obvious (and probably would have been his anyway.) However, the city may also be in need of a new king soon, and the GM suggested that this could be the reward the card provides. (It's not unreasonable. Assuming he survives, he'll be a hero, and he's well known to the people who will decide who the new ruler is. He's helped or saved all of them in the past.)

*TL:DR - I have a new intelligent sword worth over 100,000gp, and I may soon be king. Clearly drawing two cards is the superior strategy.*

I'd love to read more stories about the Deck of Many Things (or other random-effect items.) It doesn't always give you what you want, but in my experience, it always provides you with a great story.

My best friend of life (let's call him John) has been my friend for 20 some years now.... It all started when we were wee lads experimenting with a sport doomed to confine us to basements and wooden cabins for years to come, that's right, the dangerous and dreaded Role Playing Games. We've played all sorts of convoluted and dramatic games together with our close knit group of friends, and he started younger than me being classically trained by his father (a veteran of the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons) at the tender age of five.

Enter le marriage proposal. John finds a woman, awesome! Has no more time for play group. ಠ_ಠ

So talking about what shenanigans he would like to have at his bachelor party we came up with a semi humorous fun time to have, tell everyone that we going out to a strip club or getting a stripper or whatever hotness that they can imagine and then instead lock ourselves in a house for six to eight hours playing d&amp;d. Now I know what your thinking...lame. But whatever this is for John, my best friend and that's what he wants. So the idea is for a double-triple misleading fest of whats really going on. The plan:

    * Part One: We tell everyone we're getting strippers
    * Part Two: Inform the bachelor party we're playing d&amp;d
    * Part Three (This is where you come in): You (the stripper DM) shows up and begins removing your clothes
    * Part Four: John wigs out about there being a stripper
    * Part Five: You DM until ?

Interested? Check the requirements to see if you qualify: A) A moderate to attractive female aged 18 to attractive. B) Someone familiar with d&amp;d 3.0, 3.5, or Pathfinder C) Must be willing to travel some bit (we live on the east coast of Maryland). Fees can be discussed as we come to an agreement. Thanks!

While watching Hawkeye use his amazing archery skills in ""The Avengers"" I couldn't help but think ""Those are some Epic level stats and feats he's got racked up"" Which then got me thinking how one would go about translating the Avengers into similar DnD characters. 

Obviously, they don't translate perfectly, and I didn't want to actually spend the time trying to sit down and do the grunt work for all six of them (at least not yet, I'm not that bored.), All of them would be level 20 or over, of course, but here's my idea of a starting point for each of them in 3.5 edition:

**Hawkeye**

* Human (Urban?)Ranger 
* Assassin prestige class
* Archery Combat Style, favored enemies include Humans, Evil outsiders, and Asgardian Outsiders
* Some Feats: all archery feats, exotic weapon proficiency (fucking awesome composite bow)
* Weakness: strangely low will save

**Black Widow**

* Human Theif-Acrobat/Scout 
* Assassin prestige class
* Some Skills: maxed out ranks in bluff, tumble, use magic device. 

**Thor**

* Medium Outsider (Angel/Aasimar/Asgardian?) Cleric/Fighter
* Stormlord prestige class 
* Weather and War Domains
* Uses his turning abilities to be fucking rad instead

**The Hulk**

* Human Barbarian
* Demolisher prestige class
* Some Feats: Improved unarmed strike, weapon focus/specialization feats (fists)
* Special - Got a wizard to cast some sort of permanent 'enlarge person, and stoneskin spell' ON his rage ability
* Special - unusually high intelligence, used those skillpoints to become literate

**Captain America**

* Half-Forged Paladin/Fighter
* Some Feats: Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Boomerang Sheild), Improved Grab onto shit I'm about to fall out of.
* Special Racial Feats: Syrum adaptation (+X Strength, +X Dexterity, +X Constitution, +1/2X Intelligence) X= 4? 10? i don't know

**Iron Man**

*i had a tough time finding a way to translate this guy*

* Human Fighter/Wizard (lvl 5 for the magic armor/weapons crafting feat)
* Drunken Master prestige class?
* Skills: maxed out Craft (weapons and armor) 
* Some Feats: Combat Presence, Indomitable, Taunting Wit, Weapon Focus/Specialization (Flaming Burst Armor).

Whaddaya think? pretty good start. Could definitely use some more in-depth tweaking.

When I play, I try to be the perfect player.  I record everything, track all my supplies, update my encumbrance as I gather treasure, make sure I know all the rules for my character's abilities.  I keep detailed lists of all the NPCs the party encounters, locations we've been to, rumors we've gathered.  I'm always willing to be the party mapper, the party treasurer, the party leader.  Sometimes I find myself being all three.

I write four to six page backstories and diligently include numerous hooks for DMs to use, including family members, young loves, and bitter rivals.  I develop the concept for my character, I gather art to represent them, I even pick out a theme song.

When I play I try to follow the plot if there is one, and to create and work towards my own goals if the DM gives us a sandbox to play in.  I make a real effort to be a team player and make sure everyone works together and the game goes smoothly, both in the world and around the table.

I'm like...the only person I know who does all this.  None of my players do it.  I ask them to, but they don't listen to me.  I can't get them to track their supplies, to remember that the things they pick up weigh something, that their arrows aren't infinite in supply.  They expect me to do all their bookkeeping and if I don't, it just doesn't get done.   They act like having to map a dungeon is an unfair burden on them and that I should just draw the maps for them.  They complain that they never get any treasure, but they forget to write down half the treasure they find and then get pissed at me when I don't know how much they're supposed to have.  They won't write backstories, and if they will they won't write ones that make any sense or are useful to a DM.  No matter what they write on their character sheet, they play Chaotic Jerky Murderhobos.  They make fun of my gameworld, they make fun of my adventures.  And none of them can ever be bothered to look anything up in their goddamn rule books.  I don't know what the goddamn base DC is for identifying a magic item, how about instead of asking me to look it up while I'm in the middle of looking up the last goddamn thing you asked me you look it up in the goddamn core rulebook in your goddamn lap!  Whew.  Sorry.  Flashbacked to last Wednesdays game.

And they never have any idea what the plot is because if it's not their turn they jibber-jabber at each other and get all surly when  I suggest a live table rule should maybe be in effect.

It's not just my current group.  It's every group I've ever run or ever played in.  And it frustrates me.  I feel like I'm a bad DM because I can't make my players want to play the game on a level where its more than just fucking around for four hours on a Wednesday night.  I have these expectations of how the game should go and it never, ever lives up to them.

When i read forums like this, I feel even worse, because it seems like everyone is having more fun than I am, because everyone has these awesome, creative, focused and knowledgeable players.  But man, I'm starting to think a lot of you are just lying.  Playing in perfect campaigns that occur only in your head.

Because it can't just be me.  I mean, when I play in other people's campaigns, the other players suck just as much.  They don't do anything.  Everyone is always ""Here we are now, entertain us.""

Is it just me?  Have I just somehow managed to only the worst players in Seattle?  Or do other DMs feel the same way?  Is it because generally we're the only RPG gamers nerdy enough to actually read stuff like the GM's Guide and other full on books on mastering role-playing?  Or are players just generally kinda sucky?

How about it DMs?  How many of you are willing to fess up to often resenting your players lack of commitment?  How about the people who just play?

Sometimes, as a DM of a cWoD and D&amp;D3.5 campaign. I feel like I have a hard time to confront my players with a credible NPC. This happens mostly when it comes to roleplaying evil characters. When I think I have an awesome evil guy (or lady), my party tends to mock him and takes up a paternalistic, sarcastic, superior attitude towards him/her. 

I'm aware that the gaming atmosphere must come from both sides of the table. Nevertheless I feel that it is my responsibility to make an effort to play a believable NPC, just as it is up to my players to roleplay their character correspondingly. The thing is: I cannot really relate to someone who wants to do intrinsically evil things (thank god!). Therefore I'd love to hear some insight on how to improve my BBEG's and as such my game and the players experience.

""The new computer came with a Norton Antivirus trial. *Rolls eyes like a teenage girl*

I have removed Norton, which was slowing our awesome newfangled thinkin' machine down to a crawl, and replaced it with the trusty AVG I have used for many years successfully.

Since I am a nerd, let me put this in AD&amp;D terms.

Norton is a big, intimidating high-level paladin. He's middle-aged but still hardy. Norton is high enough level he can cast cleric spells better than the party cleric (whom he doesn't like anyway, since she worships the wrong god) and can turn undead.

Norton rides around on a giant warhorse covered in barding, all the time. He also insists on wearing that full suit of blessed platemail armor all the time, which means he needs his squire's help to pee.

So everywhere the party goes, Norton is blustering around on horseback, calling out challenges and waving his heavy lance +5.

Now Norton is a great guy to have with you if you happen to be storming the castle of a lich, or busily engaged in freeing maidens from a hungry dragon.

But Norton slows down the whole party most of the time.

And he's lawful good to the point of absurdity. When you are trying to parlay with the orc king for safe passage through his mountain pass so your party will arrive in time to save the day, Norton stands between the two of you and brandishes his +5 holy avenger at the orc king while shouting insults about his mother.

Not. Helpful. At. All.

No, what the adventuring party really needs is a chaotic good ranger. Quiet, pragmatic, quick-moving, flexible, and willing to stay in the shadows until needed.

AVG is that leather-clad ranger. You might not want to storm the gates of the Abyss with him in the lead, but he's a damn sight easier to work with than Norton most of the time.""",,False,,t5_2qh2s,False,,,True,t3_go9a6,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/go9a6/norton_antivirus_as_explained_through_add_terms/,

(details within)",SamuraiCarChase,157,38,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/15t7o3/tonight_we_played_a_our_first_session_of_ddopoly/,"I have a group of players that have been playing d&amp;d forever, but are taking a very appreciated hiatus while I run Mage and let them do something new. I needed a break from running the game (just to get my story together) and decided we should play a one-shot, and they seemed eager to play d&amp;d again, but I wasn't up for going back to the traditional game that we've been playing. I love 3.5, but I find it sort of boring.

So, I spiced it up. I told my players that we would be playing something different for a one shot, and that they would all be making characters. Shortly after, I announced that we would be playing Monopoly, but that everyone still had to make an 8th-level character. Just a few days ago, these are the official rules that I posted:

*Everyone builds a 8th level character. It can be crazy, but you have to be able to play it fast. 10 seconds to have a move ready maximum. This is only to keep it from being tedious. Any books, feats, classes or races are allowed as long as all are legal builds that do not exceed level 8.*

*Start monopoly as normal. Every piece of property has a monster that lives on it (undetermined until threatened). When you land on a square with an unpurchased property, you have the option of purchasing it, but you must get past the monster in order to make the purchase. If you do not wish to purchase it, your turn is over.*

*If you DO want to buy the property, a creature is randomly generated from CR 3-6 (depending on side of the board) and from thereon assigned to that property. Railroads encounters are always multiple creature encounters up to an appropriate CR rating, and scale by how many railroads the player owns, not by which side of board it is on. Combat is assumed on open plain with no difficult terrain or obstacles.*

*On each turn you may proceed with 3 rounds of combat. If you do not finish your fight, you resume on your next turn. Combat starts from 5-30 feet apart from enemy, randomly determined by a d6 roll. If you can win a fight in one round, you get the property for free. If you lose the fight, you pay the property value but do not get the property.*

*Once you own a property, you own that property's assigned monster. You may decide if your monster attacks someone that stops on your property, but if they beat it they may choose to not pay rent on the territory.*

*Daily powers are regenerated after successfully obtaining property, and the character is healed as if a night’s rest has taken place. Characters may choose to spend any purchased healing, but they do not experience a complete restoration. Characters are restored to full health once they pass GO.*

*If a character dies or comes under any occurrence that they die in combat, they go to jail as if they drew a “Go To Jail” card (do not pass go, do not collect money, etc). Normal jail rules (3 rounds max, out by rolling doubles) apply, but while in jail a character spends their turns fighting the Dragon (rules via MM pg82 Juvenile Bronze Dragon). If a character dies, they are restored at full hit points at the end of their third turn in jail at regular hit points.*

*(when all else fails, default to Monopoly rules over D&amp;D rules)*

It's a bit late at night to add more feedback, but we've agreed to discuss what did and didn't like. Thought I would share it, though...

I've been playing D&amp;D for a long time. This is relative to me being a college student, but I've still been playing D&amp;D for half of my life. Each time I've played, it's been in some mystical, magical place. No matter what the setting or plotline or characters, everything was played serious. This year, I started DMing for the first time. I've managed to keep the group going for four months, longer than any other game I've played. I started out playing it serious, but that didn't go well. Between short attention spans, inexperience, and a rules lawyer, my players just couldn't stay interested. So I improvised.

The first thing I did was make our setting more ridiculous. The first NPC the party befriended was a man named Trader Joe, who is of course a merchant. Instead of having to search around town and ply for information, my party simply tasks Trader Joe with obtaining for them most of their purchases. From here, things started improving. The bar that our party is based out of is named the Bearded Maiden, run by the only dwarf any of the party has ever seen. The party has developed full blown alcoholism. They are constantly trying to get sponsored by the Newcastle beer company. They've spent almost as much gold on booze as they have on potions and weapons. If a player is gone for a session, it's assumed that they follow the party around while blacked-out drunk and very suggestible, and are told about their actions at the next session. It's also a rule that if you have an unexcused absence from playing, your character fucks a fat chick while you're gone. This really pissed our cleric off. Also, our party has become obsessed with obtaining ""special oregano"" from every merchant they meet, after being introduced to it by two stoner wizards they rescued from the food they accidentally animated.

Second to this, the PCs themselves are becoming more ridiculous by the session. Part of this is due to the Grog of Infinite Whimsy, of which I'll post a link to at the bottom. Here's our party:

Our Fighter's name is Tanksy. Heavy armor, shield, and sword. High Constitution. Tanksy drinks more than any of the other characters combined. He's developed a love for pretty dresses, which he collects. Tanksy is able to fire anything from his longbow that he can pick up, the best example of which would be living Kobolds and acid flasks. Tanksy was abducted by aliens and implanted with a mysterious device, but no one knows what it does. If someone makes eye contact with Tanksy, it is physically impossible for them to look away.

Our Rogue's name is Sneakers O'Toole. Every time he unlocks a door or finishes a fight, he sings ""I am Sneakers O'Toole!"" to the tune of ""I'm a big kid now!"" Sneakers is friends with Tanksy, in that he convinces Tanksy to do terrible things for his own amusement. Sneakers is able to belch fire with a Fort save whenever he's plastered. Sneakers has an invisible backpack, it looks like he's pulling items out of nowhere. Sneakers also has a 50 foot tall robot. It appeared behind the bar they frequent, and the party has since started living in it, naming it the ""Best Treehouse Ever!"" Sneakers also has a penchant for shitting in the boots of any enemies they subdue or capture.

Our Wizard's name is Jenkins, possibly named after the great Leeroy, but none of us are sure. Jenkins has a fondness for Magic Missles, and has developed the ability to cast them by pelvic thrusting and yelling ""Skeet Skeet!"" while the missles shoot forth from his crotch. Jenkins's organs (heart, lungs, intestines, liver, etc.) have condensed into one superorgan with the functionality of the rest combined. This has made him unnaturally skinny, and Sneakers is convinced that Jenkins is actually a Lich. Jenkins sweats blue smoke. Jenkins is also surprisingly good at throwing carrots. He throws them with the accuracy and force of a magic missile, and can carry up to five carrots on his belt at a time.

Our cleric's name is Doc, though he keeps trying to convince us his name is actually Frank DeFresne (Google it). Doc is the butt of all our jokes, and has banged several fat chicks while blacked-out drunk. Doc has a pencil thin mustache, and has a tendency to talk in a British accent whilst stroking it.

Our Druid, who joined the party at level 5, is named Tibbles. Tibbles is a special man. He has a fondness for marijuana. Tibbles has a talking rainbow unicorn that serves him. The Unicorn is named Fabulous, and refuses to be helpful. It won't go into dungeons or carry loot, is simply carries Tibbles whereever he needs to go. Tibbles has the ability to use Mage Hand at will, but so far has only used this to steal drinks from behind the bar, and to lift up unsuspecting women's skirts. Tibbles's animal companion is a large gorilla that follows him around. The gorilla's name is King Fuzzyblankets, has bull horns, and is only nourished by the souls of whatever he kills.

EDIT: I forgot to add that Tibbles has a chicken on his head. No matter what happens, the chicken refuses to leave. I cannot be harmed by any means the party has tried, including weapons and magic. The Chicken has a surly disposition, and bawks at anyone that looks at it. No eggs thus far, but I'll keep you posted.

In addition to all of this, the party is unable to sit or lie down. Whenever they attempt to, their body ends up floating half an inch over the ground. Their feet are unaffected, and are always touching the ground. This makes them harder to pin while grappling, but also make it harder for them to grapple others, so there is no real benefit fro it.

And that's my party thus far. If you've got any feedback or advice, please let me know.

I've grown a lot closer to them as well.  They were all reasonably good friends, except for one player who is the younger brother of one of them... but now they are truly Companions.  I don't know exactly where I fit into the dynamic, as Tale-Weaver, angry deity, and enemy commander... but it has truly been an experience which many a psychology or communications paper could be written about.

The crazy part is, that after a year and a half of play (usually sessions are every other week), *we aren't even close to being done*.  The nature of the true threat has only begun to reveal itself; they don't know it's true name, despite being intimately familiar with it.  They have just leveled into the realm of ""moderate bad-assitude"", where they are some of the most powerful of normal mortals- they could go toe to toe with the best warriors that an average sized city would have to offer, but they are still vulnerable to being overrun or ambushed by average thugs.  (Part of this is a product of the system, which makes everyone vulnerable to a well-struck blow.)

In our last session, the players fought their largest battle ever (with the exception of a ""dream sequence"" battle where they controlled the prior generation of heroes in that Age's climactic battle).  Fighting alongside a tribe of bugbear-like demi-humans (who they had previously only had bad encounters with), they fought off an entire platoon of enemies- 30+ bugbear warriors/berserkers, 3 sergeants, 3 gnomish grenadiers, and a rampaging Ogre.

After fighting with the friendly tribe and earning their trust, as well as explaining the incredible circumstances that brought them so far afield, the players have been invited to the tribe's ancestral home, a valley flanked by high mountains and a massive set of fortifications.  Here the players will meet the tribe's political and spiritual leaders:  a displaced demi-goddess forever awaiting the chance to return to her home, a handful of arch-mages who have pledged to aid her, and the undying demonic entity who was the architect of the previous cataclysm (he is even more despised and hunted in the land of the dead, for he failed to lead them in conquering the realm of the living.  He does not seek atonement so much as he seeks peace, and he realizes that during the several centuries in which he ruled the world in preparation for conquest, the world experienced a golden age of peace and prosperity).

I don't write out the entire story in advance because I like to let it evolve in response to the player's actions.  I am big on not having black&amp;white morality.  There aren't generally good guys and evil guys.  There are some that live by codes of honor, or place altruism above pragmatism, some that put selfish concerns first, some that will commit heinous acts to protect their people, and so forth.

The problem is, *there is so much left to go*.  When I think about it, I want to break down and cry sometimes.  I just want to move things along as swiftly as they are written in my head... but no, RPG's are all about reacting to player choices, fighting lengthy (and epic) battles with uncertain outcomes, and having long RP sessions *where I sometimes wind up saying things I didn't mean to say... and all this shit is now written into the story now.*


I just wish it was over, but ending it now, or any time soon, would ruin everything.  I'm obligated to see the story to its end, unless I randomly get hit by a bus or something before then.  It's not even that I don't ENJOY playing... I usually do, but when it's over, it's always more exhaustion and relief than joy and appreciation (that the player's feel).

I don't know where I'm going with this.  It's 4:30AM, I guess I should sleep.  But if you read this and you are a player with an awesome DM, I hope you appreciate all the hard work and love that goes into a great game.  And if you are an awesome DM who is stressed out, burned out, and one failed saving throw vs. Death Magic away from losing it... well you aren't alone.

We started playing D&amp;D and Shadowrun (both 2nd edition) during lunch and after high school.  
This guy... I'll call him Ed because his laugh and vacant stare reminded me of [this guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhZ0TKdgJGg). He wasn't a screaming maniac or anything, but there was something a little *off* about him.  

A few highlights of playing with ""Ed"":  

* We knew the owners of a local comic/wargaming shop and went there to play Rifts after hours one day. Ed has to leave early, so he walks to the door.  
Ed tries to open it once but finds it is locked. He then stands there, bookbag over one shoulder, staring blankly at the door. He's clearly not sure what to do next so the owner shouts to him ""Just turn the latch to unlock it"".  
Ed reaches toward the [sliding plastic sign](http://salepowersigns.com/catalog/images/843.jpg) and turns the switch from ""Closed"" to ""Open"".  
He tries the door again. It's still locked.  
  
  
* Same place, different time. They had one of those [giant gumball machines](http://www.gumball.com/images/products/detail/Giant_Wizard.jpg) with the spiral ramp inside. He bought two gumballs as quickly as he could because he ""wanted to race them"".  
  
  
* Another time we were playing Shadowrun. Lone Star (the cops, basically) have our group at gunpoint and we are seriously outmatched. Our hands are up, our weapons are down. The cops shout ""Don't move!"".  
Ed chuckles and dances, waving his hands in the air.  
The GM asks ""Very funny, but that was *out of character* right?""  
Ed chuckles again and says ""No.""  
They shot him *so* many times.  
  
* Another Shadowrun story. We had been doing some mission in the middle of the desert, wearing these homing beacon wristbands so our pickup could come find us. We call the pickup and he comes and picks us up in a helicopter. A couple in-game hours later, we're travelling over a huge body of water somewhere.  
The pilot, from the sealed armored cockpit, opens a drawer by the cockpit door for us to give him our wristbands through it(kinda like the drive through teller at a bank). When we take them off, we notice they prick our skin; the mage of the group realizes that this is likely to keep a DNA sample which can let a magic user perform rituals on us from afar. A *very bad thing*.  
Ed had a plan though. He put a grenade in the drawer just as it was about to close.  
In his defense, the plan did exactly what it was supposed to.",,False,,t5_2qh2s,1347597813.0,,,True,t3_zv0pm,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/zv0pm/have_you_ever_had_a_that_guy_in_your_gaming_group/,

We didn't finish.  But we did spend *way* too much time talking about details the original creators didn't seem to weigh heavily.  Short summary of the massive book: you're trapped in a giant dungeon till you kill &amp; level your way through the whole Monster Manual.  But my fixation became little stuff like: how was my character going to avoid starvation?

In the end, we cleared the first area of the dungeon in under a week (game time), gaining two levels in the process.  We slept behind a locked door the thief rigged up and ate roasted [cloakers](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG36.jpg).  We intimidated a bunch of goblins into surrendering and then turned them to the task of converting the first level we'd cleared into a little town.  We had a cemetery for the thief, after she flubbed her search check on that fireball trap.  We began to cultivate several species of mushrooms.  We designated a few rooms as bathrooms and assigned some goblins to clean them (and to repurpose waste as fertilizer).  For safety reasons, several doors were kept under Arcane Lock at all times, just so nothing would sneak into our undervillage.  We quickly realized that once we were running the show in a dungeon, infrastructure was necessary.  Plus food was nearly impossible to come by; man cannot live on mushrooms alone.  Then the corollary is: why don't we see this kind of thing in every dungeon?

Maybe it's not the most cinematic thing ever, but orcs still need to eat and poop, even if they're monsters in a dungeon.  Many intelligent beings (maybe not the orcs) are going to want a place to lay their dead to rest.  Get enough monsters together and you might want to think about a system of government that's not simply ""the biggest monster is the chief.""  If they wear clothes, they might need a weaver/tanner/whatever.  And so forth.  A DM probably assumes this if we're talking about Drow, since they have a whole underground civilization, but it doesn't make a ton of sense to build **any** dungeon crawl without thinking about this stuff.

There are easy workarounds-- underground areas might have passages to the surface, and food's bought above.  In a deeper setting though... if there's no photosynthesis, how is there any functioning food chain down there?   Well the whole reason I got reminded of the World's Largest Dungeon is [*this article I saw*](http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/scientists-identify-eight-previously-unknown-species-in-underground-cave-near-ramle.premium-1.458033) over on r/Biology.  Basically a food chain (with eyeless crabs and scorpions) can exist using only minerals in the rocks.  So does that mean my argument about dungeon ecology is invalid because life just finds a way?  Maybe.  I mean, sulfides are sufficient to power this ecosystem, but it's just a cave with some crabs.  To fill a dungeon, you'd need something with more juice, no?  Maybe a vein of mithril or crystals or whatever, though, would serve.  But that's starting to sound like an entire plot point.

TLDR: Dungeons actually make a lot of sense if duergar are eating eyeless scorpions which feed off tiny bacteria which, in turn, are oxidizing mithril.  Or something.

AMA.",beeblez,175,55,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/jzzdc/recently_completed_a_3_year_long_dd_campaig_that/,"This was my Magnum Opus as a DM, I don’t know if I’ll ever take on a project so large again, but at the same time the big reveal was one of my most satisfying moments to date. The adventure, which took part in several chapters, had real world allegories and many direct “breaking the fourth wall” moments that no one realized was breaking any walls at all. Essentially very early on the players found magical amulets they carried with them despite not knowing exactly what they did, but discovering they were tied to powerful scrying magic. Essentially Murdoch was another incarnation of Iuz, The Old One, the god from Greyhawk. Murdoch is one of the oldest surviving names, dating back to the Epic of Gilgamesh, so I directed any questions about the name back to the Epic, and no one questioned it.


Essentially the entire story, which started with a corrupt banker employing the party to guard a caravan, was an elaborate reality TV show designed to manipulate the real world by drawing clear allegories, and placing them in the popular consciousness of vigilantism and the dangers  of encroaching savages and dark skinned people (the drow). Respect to authority figures and traditional modes of power was the best defense against these strange forces of upheaval laying siege to the land of greyhawk.  One of the main plot lines was beating back the drow who had been steadily expanding their influence and wanting to institute their own system of law and governance over the surface races. In the process of overthrowing them they encountered prison reality TV shows they mistook for convicts drafted into military service, and an elf porno set they interpreted as a brothel.  There were many such examples of such quasi-intentional misdirection when encountering examples of the modern world. The players *never* clued in.


They were haunted by dreams of a land of black monoliths that were surrounded by clouds on all sides—skyscrapers—in which peoples souls became imprisoned by various magical events throughout the game. They had special reinforced black ropes that were actually long extension cables, and numerous other bits of modern day technology that had been left behind by film crews, but I described them in such ways they never had a clue (ie. At one point they stole a bunch of griffon eggs from a room with strange black half spheres built into the ceiling… web cams that were streaming footage of adorable baby griffons onto the internet). 


Eventually they became aware of the great wizard Ailes, who was in fact Roger Ailes, CEO of Fox News, and his legion of drug addled barbarians who served his every whim without realizing they were being manipulated. It was in their attempt to overthrow this plot that the walls of the conspiracy came crashing down.


The campaign ended with them breaking the 4th wall, traveling to a near future version of our world, fending off SWAT teams of trained assassins in high rises, and breaking into the board room of a megalithic news corporation and defeating Iuz, aka Rupert Murdoch, and preventing the world of Greyhawk from being destroyed in an attempt to brainwash the public and support the military industrial complex upon contemporary earth.


The campaign ran for years, and had many distinct chapters designed to be allegories to modern political conflicts. It's late now, but fire away if you have any questions and I'll answer them tomorrow.

1362716713.0,115,self.rpg,19w6a2,Is My DM Bad?,Attipark,158,43,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/19w6a2/is_my_dm_bad/,"Ive been back and forth on posting this, but figured I would go ahead and get it over with here. This post is half rant, half looking for help and half sharing experiences for other DMs to learn. I apologize for the wall of text, I just want to be thorough.

The question I continue to ask myself lately is: Is my DM bad?

Background

When 4th Ed came out, a friend of mine started a campaign which lasted for several years. After a while though he asked that I DM a second campaign as he was getting burnt out. We spend a fair amount of time swapping between campaigns (every Wednesday for ~2 hours or so) before he decided to stop playing tabletop games altogether.

I talked to the group and we switched to Pathfinder and started a new campaign which we have been playing for about a year and a half now. Several months ago my girlfriend and fellow player in my campaign had some health issues which were voiced to the party as we are all friends. In January I pulled one of my players aside (veteran DM/player for over 17 years) and told him that due to the time commitment with the GF and her health issues, I would prefer to take a break from DMing until everything is settled. He agreed and the group was understanding, my campaign would be put on hold until I had more time.

I was excited to play again and to have more free time. I had heard a billion stories about how this guy had DMed (3.0/3.5) awesome and memorable games. I couldn't wait to see how he handled DMing and wanted to learn from him.

However after playing for 2 months (7-8 sessions) I believe that he is a shitty DM. Please let me elaborate as to why I think this:

* When we were playing in the original 4th Ed campaign, the DM invested a ton of money into dungeon tiles. Along the way we also picked up a battle mat. I prefer the battle mat, however the DM in question (lets call him Bill) uses the dungeon tiles.  My problem though is that he pulls from every set, meaning that the map/landscape is a hodgepodge of various tiles that visually don't make sense.  We had a fight atop a lighthouse several weeks ago, however one of the larger tiles from one of the snow/ice sets was used simply because it was a ravine and he wanted a hole.
* Bill narrates character actions. If while in combat the DM adds flavor to a player's actions, cool. Bill does this with everything though and players are not given a chance to roleplay as they are being told what their character is doing.
* Bill makes up character backstories. During the second session, he introduced my second character (we will get to that...) and filled everyone in on MY characters backstory. Problem is that I had not written one yet.  He has done this for every other player as well.
* When we started playing, we had 6 players in the party. One of the players wanted a friend to join in and Bill allowed this. Before our session started, Bill informed the group that 7 players would be too much and that he wanted to break the party up. He would allow one group to play on Wednesday and he would run a second game on Saturdays. Obvious problems are obvious here, we had been playing together for several years, splitting the group would make it so I couldn't run my game unless everyone agreed to change again and as adults with busy lives we had made a point to set time aside on Wednesday to play. I don't have a problem with bringing in this 7th guy, he is pretty cool, but the fact that the group wasn't consulted about any of this was upsetting.
* While at the table, there is little to no NPC interaction whatsoever. Anytime we are in front of an NPC, he simply resorts to ""What do you want to do?"". I've asked him about this before and his response was that there will be no NPC interaction. Disheartening when trying to roleplay.
* When talking about how he plans out his sessions (again, trying to learn from him a bit) he has told me that he plans out 3 sessions in advance. He knows exactly where we are going and what we will be doing. This amount of railroading seems to be preventing roleplaying and is causing me (and the GF) to not enjoy the game.
* We try to play for about 2 hours on Wednesday night. As I said, life+other responsibilities mean that we can only put forth so much time for the game. Often times though the game goes on for 3.5 hours. Bill will continue to talk/""narrate"", sometimes even commenting that it is past time to pack up but that he REALLY wants to get this portion of the game done. Mind you, we play at his house as he has the most room so I can see the convenience/lack of worry about going over when you are already at home.
* In the 7-8 sessions that we have had, we have gone through probably 3 or 4 ""skill challenges"". These were awkward in 4th Ed and especially awkward with Pathfinder. The problem in my opinion is that skill challenges suck. They aren't part of the pathfinder ruleset (unless I am blind) because they limit creativity and railroad the players. Bill still loves them though.
* Bill is quite a descriptive DM, however it has gotten to the point where he will stand behind the DM screen and read a full page that he has printed earlier. He slams the players with information to the point that we cannot keep up and are unable to take notes. We have been playing for 2 months and I still have no clue what is going on because of the sheer amount of information being thrown at me. Not only that but I have little to no interest in the story because I have nothing invested in it. Bill makes it all up and we have no input.
* After a couple of sessions, Bill asked for us to make a Profession:Sailor check. All at the table confirmed that we did not have the skill. Part of the problem was that we knew nothing of the world (We started at 9th level as thats where my game left off) so we did not know how to allocate our skills. Session after session he continued to ask for this skill check. When I went to 10th Level, I just put several points into the skill to shut him up. I didn't want to put points into it, but I knew otherwise he would continue to do these checks and we would continue to be punished for not having the skill/failing whatever check. I suppose it doesn't matter though as Bill also created my backstory :)
* During our first session he killed my character. I certainly don't think that he was trying to be malicious towards me at all, however the circumstances behind it were as if the stars aligned. The party was advancing onto a house to investigate screams from inside. As the Wizard (Spell Slinger) I stood back to provide cover etc. From the trees pop out 2 large ""mage killers"" (for the life of me I cannot remember the name of the monster. Both of them knock me unconscious with the first 2 hits. The paladin falls back and hits me with a LoH but now I am in a pickle. Anything I do will provoke an AoO. I drink a potion, risking the AoO and Bill rolls poorly. The monsters turn comes up and they kill me with crits. First session, never playing a Wizard before (always the DM) and my character is killed.
* Speaking of PC deaths, we have had 3 so far. 8 sessions max, 3 PC deaths...
* After my first character was killed, I was informed that my new character would start back over in respects to XP. Because my character was killed, the new one started fresh, regardless of showing up to play.
* During our last session, we were invited to the Captain's quarters (on a ship). The Captain pulled out a bottle of wine. We were then told that we were drinking the wine (remember, he narrates what our character do). We were THEN informed that we took a penalty to our constitution. Fight ensued.
* While the whole group of us are friends, half of us all work at the same place where as the other half are...slackers. Classic stoner slackers that all work at a pizza place, get high when they are off etc. This is all fine and dandy, whatever you want to do on your own time is YOUR business. The problem is that it is being brought to the game. Often times the slackers show up high or (because one of them lives with the DM) go into the roommates room to get high before the game. They have even left while in the middle of the game to go get high. Sometimes they bring hard alcohol to the game and drink it during the session. Again, I don't care what you do on your own time but during a session it just feels disrespectful. My thought is that the DM is responsible for handling issues like this. Bill doesn't see this as an issue and has no plans to stop it. Honestly I am not even sure that he notices because he is too busy reading from his notes.
* Bill has no problem taking things away or ""outlawing"" something in game. Currently he has outlawed Humans as a playable race, the ability to fly in any way/shape/form. No wizard spells for fly, no Dragon totem for Barbarians etc. He has also outlawed the wish spell and has told the group that they will never have access to it.
* During character creation, we were told that we could spend up to the listed character wealth to generate a character (46,000 at 9th level). However any extra money would be lost and could not be carried into the game.
* During one session, we were given the opportunity to sell off some of our collected treasure (gems etc). While selling stuff (which consisted of Bill saying ""mark it off your character sheet and add the gold"", no roleplaying etc) we were offered the chance to purchase a bundle of ""Javelins of Thunder"". When thrown, these weapons turned into a lightning bolt. Later on we approached a door and were told that the only way to open it was to hit it with lightning at two different points. After trying several different spells were tried (lightning bolt/shocking grasp) we were told that the only way to bypass the door was to use the javelins that were still available for purchase.

So my problem is this:

Bill is a friend of mine. I have known him for 6 years and in general he is a cool guy. To make matters worse, I am his boss at work. I've tried to talk to him about some of the issues I have mentioned but he doesn't budge.

I am looking for some confirmation that I am not being an overly sensitive asshole, that maybe he isn't doing things a bit right. Maybe a way to confront/bring up my problems with the same. If things aren't resolved, I honestly am not sure if I will continue to play. Its a shame really but if I am not having fun in it, I would prefer to not waste time.

I read over the module made a little gate encounter so they could get some killing in and here we went. Warning the Following Contains Tomb of Horrors Spoilers 

The party opens with a Kobold Necromancer Cleric, a Human Radiation Mage (A homebrew test for a post apocalyptic campaign my group is planning), a Wild Dwarf Knight and his Wolf Noko, and a human Bard based of Dorkness Rising's Flynn the Eternal.

The party through abuse of the Kobold necromancer's trap checking friends finds all the pitfalls in the main tunnel after a close encounter with one of the fake entrances that wiped out the necromancer's troll skeleton. The party finds the secret door to the Gargoyle room and the Gargoyle kills the Kobold in a single round. The Wild Dwarf repays in kind with a lance from the back of his wolf. 1 party member down, but wait the Kobold had a scroll of raise dead and the bard brings him back to life. They meander down the hallway and after inconclusive results from walking through the mists and a narrow escape from a jail cell, the Dwarf decides to head through the devil's mouth. Suddenly removed from telepathic communication the bard follows, the kobold figures out this is a sphere of anhiliation and the party is down two members. The remaining two and Noko head outside and after tampering on the ethereal plane attract demons who drain the Kobold and radiation mage of their remaining levels and use suggestion to send poor Noko away into the woods.

Tomb 1: Party 0 Entered Tomb at 6:30 TPK at 8:45 PM(We decided Noko became the animal companion of a powerful druid and after Noko's passing the druid weaved a new star as a memorial to his friend Noko became that world's dog star)

Party Mk. 2: A Grey Elf Warblade/Expert/Dungeon Delver, a gun toting human wizard, a human rogue/cleric of luck and destiny, and a strangely familiar Kobold Cleric try this again. Through taunting the gargoyle the Grey elf is able to trick him into charging him and getting tossed into the Devil's Mouth. The party continues making their way but an ill placed arrow sees the end of the wizard and that player's exit for the night. And then there were three. They travel through the mists losing all their gear and getting teleported outside the dungeon. After reequiping they return. Slowly and methodically they make their way through the dungeon, but teleporting without seeing where you are going is unwise and so Artifex the Grey Elf Dungeon Delver meets a firey end in lava.  The Kobold and the Lucky one remain. They make wonderous progress even defeating the ""Complete Bullshit"" of Gary's Elephant Stone Juggernaut. Placing a crown on his head and then touching the wrong end, the Lucky one isn't so lucky. He is a pile of dust in the wind. Then there was one. Unable to find traps the poor Kobold Cleric bites the dust. 

Tomb: 2 Party:0 10:00PM Start 3 AM End

The party Mk. III A Dragon Shaman, a Warlock Rogue, and a familiar Kobold begin making their way through the tomb evading the traps as if they had been there before. They make it to the chamber of the demilich only to have their souls drained one by one. TPK 3.

Tomb: 3 Party: 0 3AM Start 9:45AM Finish.

15 hours and No Survivors, No loot, and no XP.

We see post here all the time about people who played or are about their first session ever. This thread isn't about that, it's about experienced DMs trying to make their first session of a campaign the best it can be.

* I think that even for sandbox games the first session is often one of the most structured games I run by following a [specific intensity flow.](http://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/feature/4032/pacing_01_star_wars.gif)

* I try to use the heroes journey to create a classically engaging plot. Now the most difficult part of this is the refusal of the call in that often if they refuse the main plot it can feel like railroading. That's something I still struggle with and often skip that point in the journey.

* If I know I am going to have players unfamiliar with the system I try to include a ""Tutorial Opening"" where I don't teach them the system via a lecture but instead I try to teach by creating an encounter that will go over the rules which will be used the most.

If anyone else has tips I would love to hear them.

Some compiled notes:

* Start things off with a bang!

* Find a way to bind the party together

* Give new players an opportunity to play around with the system before the game starts if they are new

* Keep your PC motivations in mind

* Know the kind of game you want to run before you start and make sure your players know what that is

* Even if it is a sandbox game don't be afraid to have a more scripted first session

* Use a common enemy to bind the players

* Start with the fun stuff by using En Medias Res and get to the exposition as you go along

Party of 4, all began at 4th level, just turned 5.

As DM, I've been careful to provide level-appropriate encounters and level-appropriate loot. However, the party just fragged an 8th level barbarian, so when I designed that encounter, I gave him a pretty sick axe (+1 Flaming Burst Adamantine Greataxe) and figured it'd be their reward if they managed not to die in the process of getting it.

The axe went to the party's own barbarian, as did the guy's gauntlets of ogre power - a magical item worth 4000 gold meant to give a +2 strength bonus - something actually roughly level-appropriate. The axe was the only unbalanced item I had planned, and I was just gonna let them have it.

The problem I'm dealing with is I accidentally told the player that those gauntlets gave him +4 strength, not +2. The equivalent item in the game is supposed to be worth 16,000 gold, making this almost as valuable as the axe.

Now the ""unbalanced"" portion of party loot has doubled in size, and both items are on the same PC. I done screwed up.

I guess I have a couple of options here...

- do nothing (seems unfair to the other 3 players)

- retroactively change the bonus from +4 to +2 (seems unfair to the barb)

- curse one of the items the barb obtained (he may be upset, but for all he knows, it was the plan all along)

- become a Monty Hall DM for the other players to even things out (bleh)

The thing about the barb they killed is he was a Frenzied Berserker. He was originally on their team, but he was prone to killing his own teammates while raging, so the party called for mutiny. Maybe the gauntlets confer a similar penalty to their wearer: Will save DC 20 or continue attacking allies once enemies are dead. Alternately, the axe could be an intelligent item with a strong personality and an evil alignment. But that's a bit more complicated, and I'm not sure how it'd play out.

How would you make this right, reddit? And thanks for your time!!

[[**Edit:** Wow, you guys really got the creative juices flowing, thanks! Next time I'll try to take a step back and think about how to turn the situation around rather than weakly try to backtrack. I'm glad I didn't go with my knee jerk reaction. I think you've all successfully convinced me not to go with a curse, and I'm most likely going to go the ""infamous item(s)"" route, since I've already established that this axe is pretty famous, and plus there are some marked similarities between the PC and the axe's former owner. Thanks!!]]

[[**Edit2:** You guys are AWESOME. Loving the big response, I really appreciate it. Let me tell you a little bit more about the story now. The players are part of basically a Viking tribe. The guy they killed was the biggest, strongest, most infamous warlord of their own tribe (but not the leader). The consequences of this kill have not been fully realized yet. I **had** been thinking of basically putting them on trial. This guy had a lot of enemies, and besides, despite seeing this guy as an asset (albeit a dangerous one), there is the prevailing thought in the tribe that ""the strong should rule"" - so the end result could be anything from the party being executed/banished, to being invited to rule as warlords themselves. (I will probably invite the party to conduct some diplomacy on their own behalf and let that factor into the final decision.) Thing is, either way, they're in over their heads. Stay or go, they've now got a big target on their backs from **enemies** of the tribe. They're 5th-level characters with the responsibilities of 8th-level characters. For their first few missions, they had this big mean warlord to tank for them; now **they're** the ones drawing aggro. There is no ""curse"" on the axe per se; the real curse is that they are simply victims of their own success. As for the gauntlets... I think I see now that whether they're +4 or +2 is completely immaterial to the actual **story** of this campaign. The real story here is that they killed this guy, and in taking his stuff, whether they like it or not, they took his identity as well.]]",,False,,t5_2qh2s,1376491439.0,,,True,t3_1kce02,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1kce02/advice_retroactively_cursing_loot_because_i/,
