I created [this spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/12wZrSZ) to cut down on the number of lists I have to keep track of when planning food for a trip, and thought you guys might like it. It's set up to give you a day-by day schedule of the food one person would eat for each meal then multiplies it by the number of people you’re planning for and creates a little shopping list. 

It definitely has limitations but I found to be really helpful when planning for our last trip. If you can think of anything that would make it better, I would love your feedback!

Just wanted to go over a couple of things very quickly. 

Now that the summer season is here I wondered if anyone would be interested in a bi-weekly recipe round up thread. Basically we could make a post with a specific ingredient (rice, cranberries, ramen, etc) and we would comment with our favorite recipes or ways to use the specific ingredient in question. Just an idea, thought I would get some feedback. 

In closing, I just wanted to mention that we politely remind everyone to utilize the tags listed in the sidebar on their posts. This really helps make our community an invaluable resource unlike anywhere else on the web.  

Thanks!

My thought process revolves around the idea of thru-hiking where, unless you do mail drops, the quality of food can vary from store to store and the seasoning may be less than sufficient for a hunger-crazed hiker.

Thinking...  
* Brown Sugar  
* Cinnamon  
* Salt/Pepper  
* Olive Oil  
* Thyme  
* Crushed red pepper flakes  
* Garlic flakes  

So the idea is to be able to spice up bland or generic foods without pre-planning.  

    Heat brown sugar, cinnamon, &amp; touch of oil into glaze for plain bagels or breads.
    Salt and pepper on any fatty meats or soups.
    Crushed red pepper on cheeses, noodle dishes, pastas.
    Thyme and garlic on lighter pasta dishes.
    Oil and salt, thyme, for seasoned rice.

These meals are, in our opinion, fucking AMAZING. We are always in awe at just how good you can eat while out on the trail.

The Pad Thai was amazingly fun to create, we had to be creative, and we call this a ""Three stage"" meal, because there are three different stages - the pre-soak, then the heat/soak/wait, then a final ""searing"".

If anyone is interested in the recipes/instruction just PM me or let me know and I can get them for you. As I said, we will be posting them on our website in due time, along with other creations!

I plan on hiking through New Zealand after living here for a while now. I have hiked a fair amount in New Zealand and South Africa and am an avid hunter/fisherman. Normally, on a large trip, there would be enough of food to forage and hunt, especially in SA where I grew up, but New Zealand is notoriously sparse in terms of native food to eat, unless we're talking about fish. 

I will be walking for approximately 3 months, living in the hills on farmland, high country stations and alpine valleys, I will also be taking my dogs with me. This may sound ambitious but I have down the hard yards in terms of planning my journey as best I can. The main issue for me is food for travel as I may not be able to hunt all the time due to conservation restrictions, weather and carrying capacity (I will be taking a rifle + ammunition with me)

So, what food would you recommend for a long term hiking trip? Packaged food such as MRE's and dehydrated goods are what I'm thinking, anything else? I have my dogs' food planned, they also get rabbits on trips and are generally used to it all, they will share meat as well if a fish, deer or goat present themselves.

My favorites though were shredded stewing beef and shredded chicken. These come back perfect, like they were never dehydrated.

The meals are good, many have vegetables (which I know I'm always lacking on the trail), easily packed, and most are vegetarian or gluten-free, if you're into that. I find them in my local grocery store, but the ""hippy"" grocery store tends to have more selection :).

My suggestion is to bring one Tastybite per person and also a [Boil-in-bag rice](http://www.successrice.com/Images/library/SuccessBrownRice.jpg), or if you're in a low-water situation, try bringing some [Uncle Ben's Ready Rice](http://savingontheessentials.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/uncle-bens-ready-rice.jpg), just heat (boil in bag) and serve. If you're willing, I'd suggest swapping meals and having a ""buffet"" of Indian, with each person getting an equal amount from each bag. 

The great thing about Tastybite is also its downfall; it requires no water to cook. You boil it in the bag it comes in (When I cook only one, I boil water, put it in, remove the pot from heat and let it sit for 10-12 minutes to conserve fuel). Unfortunately, requiring no water means it's heavier to pack, so if you're into ultra lightweight packing, it's probably not for you! For all of us other backpackers or campers - is Tastybite worth the weight? YES!

For a complete meal, I suggest ending with some Chai tea. [Oregon Chai](http://musingsfromasahm.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/OregonChaiTea1.png) makes great tea packets; just add water. If you're really crazy you could add powdered milk to it, too (it contains some milk already). If you can find powdered coconut milk.... I shudder to think the delicious drink you could be enjoying after this meal.

Want an appetizer? I suggest Curried Cashews. If you want to DIY, you cna try [this recipe here](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/curried-cashews-recipe/index.html) - but I haven't tested it out. My local grocery store carries them in the bulk section.

I had put in a reservation for camping the other week and just yesterday I had received a fire ban email at the campground. This includes stoves. So now I am faced with a reservation that cannot be cancelled and 4 nights of hiking (but luckily we will have a car at the base camp, but we are in a primitive camp site in the woods somewhere). Now what I need is to have some sort of meals for me to prepare that do not require any sort of cooking, and I would like it if they were not the same meals over and over. I will have the use of a cooler and will prob end up making sandwiches, but I do not want these for breakfast, and sandwich meat will not hold up for long on 8 hour hikes everyday in central Florida. Do you guys have any hike friendly meals that require no cooking and even better no refrigeration?

**EDIT** I have talked to the campground and I am able to use my stove again. They just made that unclear due to a mistake; however, I would rather still continue this since it may be something I will be looking into again in the future.

**Post Trip** Hummus worked very well, but will go bad after like 3 days here in FL on just a normal spring night. So as recommended below maybe dehydrate it before going to later re-hydrate it. Some other things I recommend would be non candied trail mix or what I did was make my own granola bars with honey, oats, dried berries, and nuts. They seemed to hold up very well to the heat. In addition lots of peanut butter and some fruits that were able to stand up to the testament of heat. These were a bit heavier and a luxury item so we only had one each. Just the normal tuna in foil packets with some dense bread I made and mayo packets. That was pretty much all I had since it met my few requirements of; cheap, no refrigeration, no heating, and can withstand the heat of FL.

I however did bring a cooler (one of the ones that has like 1 cubic foot of space.) and this was just barely large enough to feed 3 young men for 3 days 2 nights of backpacking.

I find that I can easily throw together delicious food for 1/2 the price with the added benefit of knowing I made it myself. My typical trip to the grocery store involves wandering up and down the aisles wondering, ""Would this be good for backpacking? Does it need refrigeration? How light is this?""

This is how this recipe came up! I found one of those [Just Add _____ Pesto packets](http://www.seriouseats.com/McCormick%20Pesto%20Sauce%20Mix.jpg), this one is from McCormick and requires water and oil. I pack in oil in a [4oz Nalgene container](http://www.rei.com/skuimage/402055) packed in a plastic baggie, because getting oil all over is not good.

**Ingredients, for four:**

1 packet Pesto Mix + oil to make Pesto - It calls for something like 3T, I bring maybe 1.5x-2x that amount

3/4 box Angel Hair (the quickest cooking pasta - feel free to use any other pasta you'd prefer)

2 cups salami chunks (we typically bring salami for lunch, so we just brought about 1/2 log more)

1/2 cup parmesan cheese

other cheese, if wanted

**Process:**

Boil Pasta. The pesto packet we have calls for ~1/2 cup water (I think), but instead I add more oil and less water. I reserve 1/2c water from the pasta (starchy water makes the pesto stick back to the pasta and generally thickens it up). Drain the rest of the pasta and return it to the stove. 

Turn stove to low.  Add 1.5x-2x the amount of oil called for on the packet, pesto packet, 1/4 cup water (half of what's called for on the packet), and the salami. Cook for 3-5 minutes, until everything is heated and looks *delicious*. The pesto should thicken a bit around the angel hair.

Serve and top with parmesan cheese and other cheese, if you want. See the pic below - I brought some cheddar because we were winter camping and it's easy to store outside in the cold. (I also chose to forgo the salami).

**For 2:**

6-8 Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed at home (depending on size, you know how many potatoes you'll eat)

2-3 chicken breasts, depending on how hungry you are

3T butter

Salt &amp; Pepper

Tin Foil - lots


It's really easy, but if you've not cooked over a fire before, this is a great meal to start with.

You need a fire. Not a rip-roaring fire, but the coals that come out of a fire. The way to get great coals is to have tons of kindling. We had a size limitation, so you'll see in the photos below we didn't have a great set of coals, but we did end up throwing in some more kindling after our pile burned down a bit. You should probably start the fire 30-45 minutes before you want to cook on it. You can see the coals we cooked on in the album; there should be very few flames (if any) that are licking the sides of your foil. Flames will burn through the foil, coals will cook it evenly.

**To cook:**

First, melt your butter over the fire in some tin foil (I make a ""cup"" out of it). 

Chop up the potatoes into 1"" cubes. I leave the skin on but remove any eyes.

Layer two sheets of tinfoil in a cross (t) shape, the smaller piece should be on top. Put the potatoes in the small piece, pour the butter over them and liberally salt and pepper. Fold up the sides, this smaller piece should be big enough to cover all of the potatoes. Wrap in the larger piece. Every item that goes in the fire should be at least double-wrapped in tin foil (triple wrapped if you buy the thin store brand).

For the chicken, make the same cross shape, stick your thawed, raw chicken in the tin foil, salt and pepper it, and wrap it up! Again, double-layer this tin foil and wrap it tightly to not let any steam (moisture! flavor!) escape.

If you're not into the meat, I cooked some faux chicken breasts similarly. I used [Quorn](http://www.quorn.us/Products/Naked_Chik'n_Cutlet.aspx) brand cutlets. They like to cook with water, so for 2 I used about 1/4 cup water and wrapped it extra tightly. They came out super moist with no leftover water.

So, place these over the coals where no flames are and turn them every 10 minutes until done. The potatoes and chicken both took about 30-40 minutes to cook, but ambient temp was somewhere around 55 degrees. I'm not sure how much it affects things!

Newish Redditor here, sent over from another subreddit by Mlsherrod (so blame them!) :) Let me say firstly that i'm in the UK so i may confuse everyone/myself by not knowing the correct terminology. This is not my fault, you all turned your back on the empire dash it! Also i am very allergic to dairy, and my GF is a veggy so anything i make has to be customisable. These are probably repeats but you never know. Recipes:

Chilli noodle soup: Make stock of your choice, cubed will do but if you can find the small tubs of the stuff they are simply better. Make half a pint or so for each person. Take noodles, soft or dried, and cook them in clean boiling water. While the noodles are cooking chop some spring onions and a chilli so they look like rings, then any or all of following; red onions, cooked meat, cooked sausage, vegetarian substitute meat product, mushrooms, etc. Now, put some stock in a bowl, drain and add the noodles until the bowl is near full and then chuck whatever else you chopped up on the top. At this point i add hot sauce as i am a masochist. Eat. Best eaten with chopsticks as the slow delivery system from bowl to mouth allows everything to just cook and soak up the flavours. I love this when i'm out, it's really fast to make, takes little actual effort and a hot meal with fresh crisp veg (spring onions and chilli last a few days in a sack if not stuck at the bottom) gives a real boost. I often make it once the tent is up and the fire lit so i can have a small meal before the coals are up to heat. You can eat it out of a mug too which is a help.

Baked apple: Take a cooking apple, pierce some small holes through to the core, then core it but not all the way through (but as my knife doesnt have a built in corer it ends up with a massive hole, which is good as the next step is...) add dried fruits and honey (scotch/brandy/rum). wrap in foil. Put at edge of fires coals. wait AGES. It will be hot and not quite cooked as you, like me, will have no patience and it will smell too nice. A quicker version is to take a banananananana and cut it lengthways. Put some chunks of chocolate in and wrap in foil. Wait much less time and eat it while you make another one but this time with brandy too.

Nuts and seeds: Put a teaspoon of oil in a pan (a wok is best but i have yet to backpack with a wok) and bring it up to a decent heat. Add, in order of size and hardness, a selection of nuts and seeds. I use pumpkin seeds, pine nuts, sesame, poppy, peanuts (unsalted), cashews, anything that may, or may not, be seedy or nutty. wait until they brown and then add a good chug of soy or hot sauce (or whatever your poison, just enough to give a thin coating) and stir briskly and then take off the heat or you'll never get the pan clean. Wait a minute until the mixture wont actually take the skin off your fingers and then eat. Make more than you think as an evening of greedy fingers will eat it all and it's nice to have some for the next day. 

As i said elsewhere, i always take a good spanish hot chocolate drink. You can find it on amazon. You don't need milk or sugar and a small amount makes better hot chocolate than anything i have ever drunk anywhere ever. Really. It's incredible. It will burn your mouth like napalm if you try it when its just been made so be careful.

Right i'll stop now, i don't want to fill the page with drivel. Thank you for your time!

1 Tbsp dry milk
1 Tbsp sugar
2/3 cup water
1 Tbsp squeeze margarine

At home: add mix, milk, and sugar into a quart size zip lock bag. Seal and shake well.

In camp: add water and margarine to bag, seal and squish bag with hands to mix it and remove air and lumps. Cut hole in the corner of the bag and squeeze onto a hot pan. Cook until bubbles form, flip, and cook till they are golden brown!

Note: Instead of squeeze margarine, you may substitute vegetable oil. If you do, keep 1 Tbsp of oil in a seperate container and pour onto pan before cooking pancakes. Syrup and jam can be used and individual packets can be found at local food diners, or you can pack your own. Makes approximately 6 pancakes.

My camping schedule typically looks like car camping one night, backpacking up somewhere, camping there for 1-2 nights, and then back to the car site to either head home or put in one more night of car camping.

That said, I find I like adding a little more comfort for a little more weight. For example, I love bringing a hammock with me up away from the car camping site and swaying in the breeze while dinner cooks.

I see myself making the same choice with respect to cooking. As an ex-golf caddie I can respect the convenience and ease of getting more weight off your shoulders, but a little backcountry gourmet cooking is just too much to resist. I'm not looking to make a soufflé mind you - but something more than boiled water mixed with freeze dried mush in a bag. Heck, someday I'll probably migrate in that direction...but not today.

Considering that, what kind of cooking gear should I consider? I looked at the GSI Backpacker series, and they approximate the cookware my girlfriend had once, but seems almost too big, even for what I want. The GSI Dualist and it's cousins seems okay too, but without a frying pan it could be inflexible about what you can or cannot cook.

Finally, what kind of stoves should I consider for whatever cookware I should be looking at?

1331730608.0,8,self.trailmeals,qw41e,[snack] Classic Larabar ~ CASHEW COOKIE,NotSayingJustSaying,10,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/trailmeals/comments/qw41e/snack_classic_larabar_cashew_cookie/,"There may be no snack easier than this one.  I for one get sick of chocolate, peanut butter, and vanilla really fast so when I discovered the Larabar I was totally on board.  The beauty: less than ten ingredients (varies by flavor).  They're all easy to make and here's a method to make my favorite - Cashew Cookie.

Ingredients: Cashews, Dates

In the baking aisle, you can find bags of cashew bits and pieces that are cheaper than the snack aisle cashews.  You can usually find dry dates (pitted are preferable) the cheapest in the produce section that have been weighed out by the store.

So now you have 2 ingredients, you're all set.  If your dates contain pits, remove them.

A food processor works great, even tiny ones if you keep your ratios right, otherwise there's no reason a knife and dedication won't work fine too.

I start by blending 2 parts dates with 1 part cashew, adding cashews as I go to keep the dates from getting too sticky.  What you want is to have tiny cashew bits embedded in a matrix of dates - not a bunch of cashews held together by dates like a Payday Candy Bar.

Now that the blending is done, it's time to form the bars.  This is where I'm going to do my part and let you know the one clever trick that makes this post worth everybody's time.  Because I know everything has been pretty obvious up to this point.

* Lay down some plastic wrap
* Lay down some waxed paper or freezer paper
* Spread the date/cashew puree 
* with a rolling pin, roll out the puree 1/4"" thick
* fold the puree in half
* fold all edges of the waxed paper &amp; plastic wrap in
* roll, fold, roll, fold, until you have the thickness you want

Stated another way, if you roll out the mix it will spread in every direction.  If you fold two sides in, it will spill out the other ends, like a burrito.  If you fold all the sides in, it will compact nicely.

when you're done, chop the bar into serving sizes, wrap em, and enjoy.

1. As light as possible before cooking (e.g. minimal liquids, preferably powdered, water can be added up there)

2. No perishables (e.g. no butter, fresh milk, eggs etc). Powdered, freeze dried and long life is good (powdered milk, minimal cooking oil all ok).

3. Can be prepared while camping (can have some preparation of the meal at home, but can't require an electric whisk out on the trail).

4. Minimal cooking utensils. All you have are a 1L cooking pot, a lightweight skillet, a spoon, spork, knife, spatula and a small LPG camping stove.

So far, Bannock bread (http://artofmanliness.com/2011/04/04/baking-in-the-wild-how-to-make-bannock-bread/) seems to fit the bill.

1342206611.0,6,self.trailmeals,wihli,[Breakfast] Bagels with Bacon (and eggs!),failsafe0,9,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/trailmeals/comments/wihli/breakfast_bagels_with_bacon_and_eggs/,"This recipe came about after a ""Winter Camping"" tutorial at REI. We asked what a great breakfast was and they suggested bagels and bacon. Sure!

**Ingredients (for 4):**

[1-2 package shelf-stable bacon AKA microwave bacon](http://bacontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/microwave-bacon-1.jpg), depending on how many slices each person wants. Microwave bacon slices are sometimes short and stubby, so try to make sure you bring enough. I leave it in the packaging so it stays fresh, but you could pop it into a plastic baggie for less waste on the trail.

4 Lender's Bagels - these are easy to cut in winter

8 slices cheddar cheese

4 Tablespoons (1/2 stick or 1/4 cup) Butter

6 eggs, optional

Why are the eggs optional? Some people don't have refrigeration when out on the trail or don't want to carry the eggs or pack out the shells. It's still a filling meal without the eggs, although I much prefer them! Since ours was a winter camping trip, we brought the eggs and kept them cool outdoors.

**How to do it:**

There are two methods: the vegetarian-friendly method and the meat-y method. The only things that are reversed are the bacon &amp; egg cooking. Let's go vegetarian this time:

Melt 2T butter in the fry pan, scramble all the eggs at first, but what you want to end up with is a big egg patty, so keep it together toward the end. With an 8-10"" skillet, you can cut it into 4 egg portions at the end (if it's a patty) or just have scrambled eggs on your bagels. They're basically the same, but the egg patty is easiest to eat. Melt the cheese during the last minute of cooking. Put it on plates when it's done and cover it with other plates (or sandwich it in some bowls, just try to keep in the heat).

If one of you (ahem! me!) is vegetarian, take the time to cook the bagel right now in a meat-free frypan.

Add in your bacon. This bacon should only take 5 minutes or less to cook, as it's already precooked. Put it on top of your eggs.

Remove bacon and throw in 1/2 tablespoon of butter per bagel. Cut the bagels in half, or if it's super cold out, cut the bagels into chunks *at home* and fry them to make a bagel hash ;). You'll fry each inside of the bagel for a minute or two to toast. Also, it's toasting in some bacon grease. Can you really go wrong with that?

Sandwich up those eggs, cheese, and bacon, and baby, you got a delicious breakfast bagel.

Tasty, very little field prep and cleaning involved, hummus is a good source of protein and nutritious. Although this takes some home preparation (cutting the veggies) you can forgo carrying a stove or fuel on shorter trips. Because of the space of fresh veggies I tend to plan this meal on the first or 2nd day of the trip.

**Serves 4:**

-1 cup of Powdered Hummus

-2 medium size zip locks of fresh veggies (baby carrots, cut celery, cut bell peppers, radishes, or olives)

-1-2 packages of Pita Bread (about 2-3 pita’s per person)

*Optional cooked sausage (for meat lovers, can heat on a stick next to a camp fire)

**At home:**
Pre-wash, dry, and pre-cut the veggies. Measure and pack the hummus (adjust portion for party size) in its own zip lock (large enough to add water to later) and write down how much water to add on the zip lock.

**On the trail:**
Follow instructions for dehydrated humus. Add the correct amount of cold PURIFIED water to the zip lock, close, and mix well. Let sit for 5-10 minutes and it’s ready to eat with pita and veggies.

-4 handfuls of ants or ant larvae (1/2 handful per burrito more if you can procure it)

&gt;In the field, on the trail keep a small bag easily accessible and as you pass dandelions, wild mustard, or other edible plants as your getting close to your campsite keep an eye out for dead stumps or ant mounds. I prefer the rotted stumps cause they’re easy to spot, there’s plenty in most Pacific Northwest forests, and almost always contain a plethora of ants or larvae (even in winter). Kick, rip, or pry the stump till you expose the ants. Use a stick to scoop them up, place the stick in a zip lock and squeeze them into the bag. If you can’t find enough ants you can substitute worms, you’ll have a good chance of finding them by turning over and looking under rocks that cover a 12” or larger diameter area. Once you’ve procured enough protein, wash your plant source, place the protein in a pan and fry for a few minutes or until brown. Heat the burrito shells, add, cheese, salsa, protein, and edible plant before wrapping and enjoying.
