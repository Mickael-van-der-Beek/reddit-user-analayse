We have a big home in NW Calgary.  

I know it's too early to tell how long these places will be affected so we just wanted to throw it out there.\

&lt;edit&gt; Also, if anyone else can offer any other kind of assistance then maybe post it here.

&lt;edit 2&gt; I heard on the radio (12:30) that High River is asking for volunteers for sand bagging. They are asking that you don't travel to High River to help though.

&lt;edit 3&gt; I should probably add that we are pet friendly as long as your pet is friendly!  Would have to get along with my Newfie and my St. Bernard who are very social and very friendly to other dogs.

&lt;edit 9:06pm&gt; Just saw a tweet that shelters and hotels are full.  My place is still available, I have a huge walk out basement and we are on a big hill in Edgemont.  Message me or anyone below if you need a place.

&lt;11:45pm&gt; I'm still awake and the offer is still out there.  I can also truck people out of the newly evacuated areas too if needed.

&lt;1:36am&gt; I'm still here for anyone who needs a place or a ride.  West Hillhurst is being evacuated now.",,False,self,t5_2qn40,1371800237.0,,,True,t3_1gqqc2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1gqqc2/evacuations_in_high_river_canmore_and_calgary_do/,

My dad could have been killed last night, along with three other people due to speed, and not paying attention. A woman in the far right lane lost control of her vehicle on ice and slid across three lanes and smashed into the car on the back of my dads tow truck, spun off that and hit the cop car near by sending the cop flying into the road. A woman was in her back seat of her car which was hooked to my dads truck collecting some items. I'm not sure what her condition is, my dad is still in a pain killer induced haze due to the whiplash he suffered. Luckily he was in his truck and not still hooking up the vehicle, otherwise he'd be dead.

PLEASE !! PLEASE!!! do not drink and drive. The roads may be dry, the taxi services fucked, the Christmas booze a flowin' but there is ALWAYS an alternative... (Where is that guy who was giving rides on Halloween!? lol) 

Seriously people check stops are out in full force even tonight I hit one and they had all sorts of people in the bus. It's just not worth it, with all that is uncertain in this world you can be certain someone cares about you and would be able to pick you up. If you absolutely can not find someone PLEASE stay where you are, stay warm and wait until morning to go home. 

Any company, friend or family worth their grain of salt would rather you get home safe, even if that means asking for a favor, it's better then the alternative.

If I was not worried about my number getting posted I would list mine as an emergency contact IE: nothing is working and you HAVE TO GET HOME.

I will do the next best thing.

Hello again everyone.
I had 2 calls last night from people that needed a ride home.  One couple from twitter (some friends that I had need in a long time so that was pretty cool) and one from someone's text message.  Had no idea what a ""reddit"" is  haha.

Thank you for who ever gave that information over.  I was told that there was a couple others out there doing the same thing which is amazing and awesome.  Good people are still very prevalent in Calgary.  Then again that was never in doubt was it?

Thank you all for the Lovely comments and conversation over the legalities over what we did here.  That part helped me keep a growing ego in check and my feet a little grounded to reality.  What was done was not to be taken lightly.  I knew the risks and took my chances.

I sincerely hope that all the taxi drivers who had taken time off had a lovely weekend with family and friends as did the rest of the city.  

See you all later at some event or another I am sure (like the MLG on November 4th at Ceili's South..  Geektastic times)

Bye for now,

LipSmith

**UPDATE OVER**



Hi,
I am staying sober and staying up late tonight to drive people who have been out at stellar parties drinking too much to drive.

If you or you know some people that would like a ride and not try to drive drunk, let me know.  I will pick up and drop off for a Donation for gas and coffee/redbull to keep me awake.

Lets keep it safe out there on the sh*tty Calgary roads tonight.


EMAIL:  calgaryistoodrunk@gmail.com  (yeah it could have been wittier) 

Please share this with anyone who might need a lift this evening. 

Cheers

I was wearing a leather jacket and black jeans, im 5'8 and had glasses but i think they were destroyed as i was pulled from the cab,

You are awesome. 

I went to do cleanup at my work today after the floods, and a lot of people stopped in at the cafe to offer their support. It was fantastic. 

I had to take a long route home because of the road closures, though surprisingly the roads were open in some of the hardest hit areas. 

As I drove through Mission, traffic was slow, and for a good reason. I saw one guy handing out 6packs to people working on their homes. Going up 4th St SW, Alley Burger had their truck out giving out burgers by donation, across the way, Original Joes was doing the same thing, and on 17th, The Ship and Anchor was doing the same.

1374521974.0,94,self.Calgary,1itzn2,Still evacuated one month later.,S_Dub7,111,17,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1itzn2/still_evacuated_one_month_later/,"Hi everyone, here's my evacuation story, just wondering what options I have available to me.

The evacuation order was issued for my area of downtown overnight on June 20 so I had no idea until the next morning when I woke up, noticed the power in my apartment was out, looked outside and the water was almost at my second floor balcony. I packed up a backpack full of clothes and called my father to come and pick me up.

It felt like the end of the world going into my hallway, I'll never forget that feeling. All I can hear is the sound of fast running water, and lots of it, lots of far away sirens and all in total pitch black. I start taking the stairs down the ground floor and it is completely submerged in debris filled muddy water and the front doors to my building have about 3 feet of water pushing in on them keeping them shut and I forced my way out.

Going to meet up with my dad I had to cross McLeod Trail and wade through the river that it had become. I got hit in the leg with a tree stump I didn't even see, it punctured into my leg and left me with a huge cut and scrape on my leg, luckily I kept my footing. I had to go to the hospital and get x-rays and vaccinations as there were some dead animals in the water. Had some soft tissue damage and hyper-extension of some tendons and was on a cane for a little bit.

Then begins the awful process of not being able to return home. The first email from my building's management team came about a full week after the building was hit by the flood, the manager and owner of the building were not answering their phones or returning voicemails. Their trend has been to send about 1 email a week, which I still have copies, all tenants have been left completely in the dark on what's happening. I've been getting no answers on repairs, anticipated move in times or just questions answered. I had been checking on the building every day for the first two weeks since the flood happened and no one even started working on even cleaning the first floor during that time. When the first clean started happening there was 1 guy doing the entire cleanup, making the process even more lengthy and no tenants were allowed to help or speed up the process. The worst part is when the manager and owner were doing inspections of units they sent out an email saying if our units didn't meet their cleanliness standards, a cleaning service would be brought in and we would be charged $250 for the cleaning. I checked my unit after they did my inspection, I spent 3 hours cleaning literally everything because I knew even a speck of dust would prompt that $250 bill.

After the inspection I went back to check my unit, I noticed the landlord had left the door to my apartment unlocked in a building with NO security system and doors that don't close properly, leaving me open to robbery.

Once the clean was done, about 2.5-3 weeks in then a whole different issue arose, the security of the building and the electrical work. The electrical work hadn't even started and is still as of today currently being done with little to no updates, expected times or contact from management about it.

Security, that's the big issue, there have already been at least 3 confirmed break ins and looting of units on the second and third floors. Squatters in the first floor have already been confirmed and kicked out by the police and the building owner and management refuse to hire a security guard or install a temporary system saying it's the tenants responsibility for the security of the building.

Over the last few days, with all the tenants chatting via email and me providing the whole building there has finally been, even though it's slow, some progress. I'm just fed up with this entire situation and have contacted personal friends at major TV and radio stations in town as this kind of action from a rental company is unacceptable. Especially because all the buildings on my block have been repaired already and people have been home for about 2 weeks now.

Update from the manager today, it is ""illegal"" for us to have the rental company's phone number, so now he's making up laws to get away from actually having to do anything.

Thanks for taking the time to read my story, any suggestions on what I should do or what I can do would be much appreciated.

How bloody hard is it for people to shut up when they are watching a movie. Yeah I get the oooohs and ahhs and the basic noises every one makes. fair enough. I mean the jack asses that talk threw the whole movie, screw around on their phones and other such non sense. Its rude. I can almost accept the younger teens doing it just from an age perspective but any one above that are knowingly being douchbags.


When some one asks you to be quiet during a movie you dont get to be offended. No one drops cash on a movie with the intention of not being able to watch it. So in short shut up and let others enjoy it.


Oh and to the employees/managers that I know frequent this sub. Dont act like their is nothing you can do about it. You can tell people to get out if they are being disruptive, grow a pair and help the customers that actually want to come to your place of business. Its crap like this why I would rather sit at home with a screener or pirated version. Better people, cheaper and I dont have to deal with any issues.

/rant, sorry guys buy after the last ten shows in a row and having managers do nothing about it for most of them and the people continuing to do it I needed to vent.

He sells those 'donate what you can' newspapers, among other things (today he was selling umbrellas too). 

Posting this as an FYI. If you ever come down around this area and see him, make sure to give him a hello. AND. A map. He collects maps. Usually those 'free' maps you get of areas when traveling. 

I do not know anything about him other than that, but I believe he is homeless. 

Very nice guy. I had a co-worker bring back a map of South Africa. He loved it. A lot. Eye's lit right up.

I'm a fellow from Red Deer who has lived in Boston for about two years, and was both present &amp; helped with the immediate recovery effort for the Boston bombing. I saw some things that I never wanted to see, but in a situation like that you really do just need to put aside your feelings and help. The internet was full of jokes about pressure cookers and martial law a day or two later, and there were people actively defending the apprehended bomber because he is attractive.

My reason for bringing this up is that the Internet is full of people who don't understand what is actually going on, and whose first response is to be immature and say idiotic things that have no connection to reality. At some point you simply have to ignore them, and focus your attention on the situation at hand. These jerks will always be there; but you actually understand, care, and are affected by all of this. Spend time with family, fill sandbags, let your mother know you love her - do whatever it is that you need to do, but don't let ignorance ruin your state of mind.

Much love and well wishes from Boston.

""Spit in the face over a Fruit Plate.

My girlfriend and I went over there this morning to enjoy a Relaxing atmosphere at the ""Relax Cafe"" on 25th Ave NW in Calgary. I asked the gentleman behind the counter how big the fruit plate was and if we could share it. He didn't know how hungry I was (said in a rude way) and walked away. When he came back, I said ok lets go about this in another way, whats in your fruit plate. He scoffed and walked away. I apologized for the inconvenience and he said that I was the inconvenience and to get the F#@ out. I said, this is stupid, over a fruit tray, you should make me, well he flew around the counter and came at me to fight. There were a bunch of kids and infants in strollers that I had to be aware of, plus he was a very aggressive and large man threatening certain death over a fruit plate. My girlfriend was pleading with the poor worker behind the counter as I had to back away, he then went into her face, spitting in her face with his anger and like an awesome girl, she politely wiped the spit off her face and wiped it back on his. Believe me I didn't see the spit incident otherwise I'd be swinging on a barrista. A few people left with us and the others were in shock.
I phoned back to speak with the owner, so happens he was the owner and told me he would be waiting there for me to come back so that he could kill me and squash me like a pop can.
We are all under alot of stress here in Calgary with these floods, weather you have it bad or not, EVERYONE has been affected in one way or another, this is a time to treat others with respect, not anger. So make sure if you go to the ""RELAX"" cafe on 25th Ave in the NW, you don't ask about the fruit plate, the owner may spit in your face.""",,False,self,t5_2qn40,False,,,True,t3_1h7luu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1h7luu/has_anybody_ever_been_to_relax_cafe_on_25th_ave/,

I called them at 2pm today to follow up, and proceeded to get hung up on twice, after them telling me that Adam was ""on vacation"" and will be back by monday. That must have slipped his mind when I talked to him yesterday.**

I had to move yesterday, and wanted to treat myself to some movers instead of lugging everything around myself as I usually do . After reading some reviews and getting some recommendations, I eventually decided to use Careful Movers in Calgary to move my 1 bedroom apartment to another building literally right across the street.

Now, if anyone isn't aware, when you move out of one of these new apartment buildings, the person moving out generally needs to pay to reserve the elevator so that no one else can use it, and the move can happen quickly (in a 2 hour window). Unfortunately sometimes there is a fee ($160 in my case) and it needed to happen twice.

Careful Movers were supposed to show up at 12:30 to start wrapping the very small amount of furniture I have (a single couch and mattress), so they would be ready for 1pm to use the elevator. Instead, me and security were standing around until 1pm with no word from the movers. I then called, and he said he was running late and would be there in 20-30 minutes. Almost one and a half hours later at 1:50, they showed up and were ready to move.

I then get a call at 4:30 from security at my new building saying that the movers aren't allowed to use the elevator because they took too long, and my reservation was over. Great. After expressing my frustration towards the head office of Careful Movers, I got a call back saying that the movers will hold on to my things until 8pm when it's not as busy, to which they can start loading up the elevator

At this point, I've been wandering around downtown trying to kill time thinking that it would originally take about 3 hours, and now I've got to kill an additional 4 hours because these guys don't know how to schedule their time properly. I ended up at a friends house with and asked the movers to contact him when they were ready as my phone had died, and my charger was in a box. I get a phone call at about 8:30 saying they need the contract signed and I should head back. One thing to mention - I would have signed the contact when they arrived in my apartment, but they forgot to bring a pen (and of course all my stuff is packed up) so I had to hold on to it for the time being.

So I tell them I'll be 20 minutes (as I have to walk back) and they start texting my friend after 10 minutes asking where I was and that I need to come back asap. So I grab all my things in a hurry and book it back to my place, and I see the guys still unloading the truck. He keeps repeating to me that he needs the contract, and I'm trying to drill it into his head that he is wasting more of my time by calling me back thinking they were done, only to tell me that they still need another hour. Great, so I end up sitting with security in the lobby for close to an hour and a half, while the security guard is telling me these movers are some of the sloppiest movers he's ever seen (he's in charge of all of the moves for the building). Residents are trying to use the elevator to get to their homes, and the guys at Careful Movers are actually not letting them in the elevator so they can continue to move stuff in.

You'd think my lovely experience would be over by now, but when I go up to check on them, I see both of them with their shoes on dragging their crap around on my freshly shampooed white carpet. What's that smell? Oh it's a bottle of vinegar that they spilled in a box (which couldn't have possibly been spilled unless they were carrying it on their side). After him not cutting me a deal for the 10 hours of inconvenience he has caused me, he tells me that he can't accept credit card ""at this hour"". What does that even mean? Is MasterCard taking a break at 10pm? Last but not least, he couldn't find the keys to the other apartment, so he disappears for 15 minutes to which I hear the other guy saying he saw them on the ground by the truck when they came in. Ugh.

He said he's been doing it for 19 years or something, but it felt like this was his first day. The fact that they didn't discount the rate at all despite all this is actually mind blowing to me. I'm going to continue to spread this review to as many sites and people as possible so hopefully people can avoid using this hack of a company in the future.

TL:DR

 Almost 2 hours late, delayed 4 hours, spilled goods, walked around freshly shampooed white carpet with shoes on, lied about not being able to take credit card, left my keys on the ground outside, refused to remove one hour off the entire bill after my entire day was ruined, broke my tv.

I've asked for a copy of the meeting minutes to find out which council members voted for this.



-------------------------------------------------

Calgary-owned Enmax subsidiary ""Envision"" has been building up a fiber-optic network in our city network for 15 years. Without consultation with the taxpayers that payed for it, this network is now being sold to Shaw in a cash-only deal for $225 million and quickly swept under the rug.

[A link to Envision's infrastructure map showing their entire network](http://www.enmax.com/envision/files/NetworkMap.pdf)

Shaw isn't above using dirty tactics to stifle any sort of competition. For those that don't remember, Shaw is the company that wanted to [implement data caps mere months after netflix became popular in canada](http://www.techvibes.com/blog/shaws-enforcement-of-hard-limits-on-residential-internet-usage-an-insult-to-their-customers-2011-01-23) and then launched its own [tv service  which wouldn't count against those same data caps](http://business.financialpost.com/2011/07/15/shaw-launches-netflix-rival-angers-ubb-critics/). 

Since when are Calgarians in the business of building infrastructure for private corporations? Why are we helping Shaw dominate our internet market? We should be using these cables to increase competition, not help the telecommunication giants into an internet Monopoly!

We need to let Nenshi know how Calgarians feel about this! Send him a tweet at [@nenshi](https://twitter.com/nenshi)

Or write him a facebook post on his [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/NaheedNenshi)

I wanted to cry and I never cry because crying is unmanly and gross. I wanted to hug each and every person who cleaned it before they left or helped keep it clean during the party.

I wanted to open my house to strengthen the community and give people a time they can't have at normal meet ups. It was hard moving all our stuff out and I still can't step anywhere in my room right now. But you guys showed you appreciated all the effort by being really respectful people. You were the best people I could ask for. I've never been so touched. I felt at home with you guys in a way I could never with some of the friends I've had. I know that sounds very pathetic and strange, but you guys are home to me.

Nothing broke and there is only a very small wine stain on the floor, but I'm sure that will come out because we soaked it with club soda right after it happened. This built a lot of trust with me, and I'm more open to having my house open.

Unfortunately my BF and I ended Saturday night (unrelated to events at the party, it's been awhile for us), so I won't have this house. I would have liked to try this again, but oh well. Maybe if I get another house down the road we can.

To Scott - Thank you for trying to give me money. I was so touched when I saw you hand me cash. It was a very honest and sincere gesture. Also, you're badass and look like Louis C.K. I hope you have an uber hot GF who treats you well.

To Dave - Thank you for cleaning my basement and helping with the wine spill. You didn't even make any of that mess. Also, for shoveling my sidewalk! Jesus, too nice.

To Spencer - Thank you for constantly offering me your beer all night and just being an all around good guy.

Adam - Thank you for bringing the heater and setting up the tents in my garage. You also seemed to be the leader of the ents, so thank you for organizing that and taking care of it.

Therese - Thank for your being the personal reddit party photographer! Also, you are gorgeous. Come back to meet ups!

Justin - Thank you for buying pizza 73 and expecting no payment. I love love love eating pizza when I'm tipsy. I'm sure everyone else did, too.

To EVERYONE who helped clean up - Let me know who you are the next time a meet up happens so I can hung you and cry and be lame and gush my feelings and and and DO IT DAMMIT.

To all the boys (Adam specifically) who helped my friend Emma - She will remember that forever. You have built a foundation of trust with her. Also, she will more likely respond to flirting and she's single so hit that up, gentlemen. (:

To Taylor - For keeping the ball rolling and making sure people were having a good time. Any room I saw you in, you were making people talk and being the life of that room. Also sharing your GGG prize. What a good guy greg thing to do. (:

To anyone who I know I should thank but I am missing right now in my I-just-woke-up-what-the-fuck state of being... thank you.

Also Edmonton Redditors: Thank you for crashing. I LOVE you guys. Come back. Also, the girls in your group are good looking. Good job scoring them, guys.

As I'm sure you're all aware, the provincial budget has really fucked Albertan universities, especially Mount Royal University, which announced that it will be cutting several diploma and certificate programs including music performance and theatre arts. 

Calgary's jazz community is full of Mount Royal faculty members, alumni and students, and we're doing our best to let ones behind this decision know that cutting this program is not okay.  

You can find out more through [Mount Royal University Jazz's facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/MountRoyalUniversityJazz) or keep up to date on Twitter by following [@SaveMRUArts](https://twitter.com/SaveMRUArts).  There is a letter posted on their facebook page that supporters of Calgary's jazz community can send to the governors of MRU, who will be voting on Thursday (tomorrow) to decide the final outcome of these cuts.  Mount Royal's jazz program is widely revered as the best two year program in Canada, and losing it would be severely damaging to Calgary's jazz community.

If anyone has any links to any facebook or twitter accounts involving the theatre department, or any of the other programs on the chopping block, please share them as well!!  

Calgary is supposed to be the cultural capital of Canada.  Let's save our arts programs and do our part to keep it that way.

So, I quickly whipped [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgMXT6bh-iYQdDFEaDdkS1BYOWVUWkJRbkhMOGMzb0E&amp;usp=sharing) together.

It has the first card from each category sorted by 'best selling', has the price (rounded to nearest dollar), also shows the performance score from the benchmark site and finally, divides that score by the dollar amount to give you the ""point per dollar"" score -- the higher that is, the better.

Everything between 15 and 20 points is green which means it's a good deal, everything over 20 is blue meaning it's a FABULOUS deal. Likewise, under 15, it's yellow, under 10 it's orange and under 5 it's red -- a terrible deal for the price.

All this makes it easy to see how the cards more or less stack up to each other, and also lets you sort by the performance score, price, model ..

It's a little ghetto but it was useful for me so I thought others might like it too.

PS: If you have $260 burning a hole in your pocket, the eVGA GeForce GTX 760 is a smoking deal (4950 performance at $260 equals a score of 19.04) and they still have 6 down SE.",,False,self,t5_2qn40,False,,,True,t3_1imthj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1imthj/any_pc_gaming_geeks_out_there_i_created_a/,

1343147802.0,66,self.Calgary,x2vma,An open letter to the City of Calgary RE:New Devonian Gardens,MissMer,82,16,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/x2vma/an_open_letter_to_the_city_of_calgary_renew/,"Devonian Gardens was straight from the pages of a child’s story book, full of character, magic and growth. So many people proposed to their loved ones there because the hidden corners offered privacy amidst beauty. Children played on a time honored playground. It smelled of wood, the fish ponds had vegetation, and it was bursting with color and warmth.

The Devonian Gardens of today is barren. It smells mouldy even though it has been opened up to the mall to prevent excess moisture. It lacks color and any of its former character has been all but washed away by a grey palate and uncomfortable sterile seating. The addition of the “living wall” is a nice feature, but unfortunately it is the only one.

A few sad fish float around an empty grey pool, fake palm trees hide down some of the side walls, an anemic playground sits out of place, and wide open spaces make you painfully aware that the space was designed not for you, not for your kids, but to make money through functions.

Yes the garden needed upgrades, but why were none of the old features that made the place special incorporated into the new design?  Why was the space designed for corporate functions and weddings instead of the people who go there to eat lunch, to get a break from the corporate office, or for parents taking their children to the park during the winter? This is a city facility for the residents of Calgary, no?

Alberta has the highest rate of divorce in Canada.

At no other time in history have children been so disconnected from nature, and been in need of places in the city like Devonian Gardens. 

So why did we build another facility for corporate functions and weddings? 

When do we invest in what’s really important? 

This garden, it seems, is a reflection of our desire to place importance on the superficial; esthetic over substance. This design doesn’t address the needs of our city’s residents for connection and community.

Hopefully in time Devonian will recapture some of what made it special, despite its current iteration. Maybe one day it will hold a little more warmth and wonder instead of being the sterile show room it is today.
 
Please, if you do nothing else, put something in that pond for those poor fish.

When we were able to get in and tear out the walls in our basement it became clear that the water in our basement had actually come from our sewer drain. I hadn't considered that it could have been sewage because there was no 'solid matter' in our basement like I'd been cleaning out in Sunnyside. What happened was that after the accumulation of water in the sewer main on our street, the storm water travelled into a number of basements on our street. Our landlord has been very helpful once he realized the extent of the problem, and has sent a contractor in to tear out and restore the basement. We've had to bin most of our possessions from our bedrooms, and we won't be living here for a bit. But our neighbors took us in for five days, and now we're trying to find a hotel close to our house. We have just received confirmation from our insurance company that everything will be covered including additional living expenses. Also, although we don't qualify for the city's disaster relief services, we may qualify for the provincial disaster relief as the entire city of calgary was listed as an affected area. At some point I'll have to go spend and afternoon at mount royal to find out.

5.) Did I mention people are friendly? 

I have a lot to learn, I suppose, but it seems like I will like this town quite a lot. Now, I just need a job, but I am interviewing tomorrow and I have great hopes.

1359692380.0,57,self.Calgary,17od1c,My car was stolen last night PLEASE help me find it or PLEASE return it in good condition after you had fun with it - I AM A BROKE STUDENT AND NEED IT FOR WORK!,Exostenza,79,22,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/17od1c/my_car_was_stolen_last_night_please_help_me_find/,"Ok I am sorry it took me a few days to relate my story, but I feel like a complete moron and it took a bit of time before I was willing to be completely honest. So here is the story: I live in Bankview as you all know and my mother lives in the south. Every time we have ever gone out for dinner, a talk, a play etc that is near the core or north of me my mother has picked me up and taken me. This has been going on for about 7 years and there have been no exceptions until the other night. We had tickets to a talk at the U of C and at the last minute my mother called me up saying she was north of me and to meet her at her partner's (boyfriend's) house which is a bitch north of here and we would all go from there. To give some context my mother has been dating this man for around a decade and I think I have only been to his house one maybe twice in that whole time. So I always get picked up and on top of that I never meet up at this house and to top it off the talk was around 7PM and we decided to go to dinner after the talk. The talk goes on for longer than we thought it would and we get out at about 10PM and pick up my brother and go for dinner on 17th at about 1030PM maybe a bit later. We all ate super late and were way too hungry - after I was dropped off at home and no one remembered that my house was at my mother's boyfriend's. Needless to say none of us do well with waiting too long to eat and we do not have the best of memories. 

The next day I go outside to go somewhere and I remember taking my keys out of my pocket and pointing the FOB at my parking spot... no car. I stood there for 10 minutes thinking where I could have parked my car, but I never park anywhere but in my stall behind my building. I then call my mother and tell her I think my car was stolen, she does not remember that I left my car the previous night at her partner's house. I call the cops and file a report and later that night my mother's partner emails me about ways I can find my stolen car - he too forgot I left my car in front of his house. 

The next three days I am freaking out as you all can see from the title of this post and all of my comments. I was so upset and had no idea what to do until my mother calls me and asks me if my license plate is XXXXXX and I freak out saying yes. She tells me it is in front of her partner's house and we all remembered at once that I had left it there before the talk at the U of C. The best part is that my mother asked her partner if he thought that could be my car before she called me up and he said it couldn't be as it had been outside of his house for over a week (which was before I had my car ""stolen""). 

Absolutely ridiculous. 

I called the cops to kill my stolen car report and the officer on duty laughed at me when I told her what happened. All of my friends and family are laughing at me and giving me a hard time which I realize I deserve and I am laughing it off. The only defense I have is that I haven't been taking my ADHD medication lately and that my m other and her partner did not remember either. 

Thank you reddit for your help and I am sorry that it just ended up being my horrible memory in tandem with other horrible memories at work. Well, at least this is a way better end than a bunch of hooligans doing drugs and tearing up my nice vehicle with only 30K on it.

We need to all pull together to get informed about poverty and homelessness and Calgary and create lasting change in our city for our most vulnerable citizens.

The stereotypes do nothing for people on the streets. Please be respectful and speak up for those who are stigmatized because they are homeless. It really is not a choice. Take time to chat with someone panhandling, or volunteer at a shelter to comprehend the gravity of the situation in Calgary.

Just Energy going door to door.,NoahBody,61,7,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1698t2/heads_up_just_energy_going_door_to_door/,"I live in the North East and I had an encounter last night. I felt I should provide a heads up to anyone out there that might be unaware of the shit these people pull. I used to work for Enmax and I've been involved in enough of the horror stories from companies like Just Energy or Alberta Energy Savings, etc. that go door to door.

The representative comes to the door and introduces themselves as someone from Just Energy, but in their hand they hold an Enmax bill as a form of misdirection. They want you to think they represent Enmax, who are the default provider for electricity in Calgary. The rep gave me a bullshit story about how he had to check my last electricity bill to see if I had multiple electricity rates on my bill.

Please note: If you're not on a flat electricity rate via some plan like Enmax's EasyMax, then you will more than likely have two electricity charges on your bill since it changes every month on a floating rate (which you have by default), and your bills aren't calculated typically from the first to the end of the month, but based on billing cycles. This isn't an error, but the representative will present it as though it is.

The idea here is to get you to present your bill to them so they can take down a Site ID (I believe this is what they are called), which they can then use to sign you up for their energy service, which will cancel any plan you may currently be enrolled in.

These Just Energy people are NOT your electicity providers and are NOT there to check on your billing for errors. In fact, no company would send people door to door to check for billing errors, that's just ridiculous. Unless you recieve a bill from them they have nothing to do with your energy. Unless Enmax has changed in the last few years they don't use door to door salesmen.

**TL;DR** : Don't show your electricity bill to anyone that's going door to door no matter how convincing they may sound.",,False,self,t5_2qn40,False,,,True,t3_1698t2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1698t2/heads_up_just_energy_going_door_to_door/,

I have to say, though, when I yelled ""good job!"" and gave you a thumbs up, giving one back, without breaking stride, was possibly the best reaction you could have given. I also applaud the fact that, despite stopping a few moments after this interruption, it appeared that the both of you regained enough of your spirit to try again, albeit in a *slightly* more discreet manner.

THANKS FOR YOUR HELP R/CALGARY!**

So I was waiting for my friends at a designated meeting place, when a group of girls from Calgary show up looking for the rest of their group too. We started talking and in the spirit of the festival, we made friends, specifically one blonde girl named Kirsten, who was the most gregarious of the group, and also rather cute.


After we'd helped each other find our respective friends, we all went together to watch Florence and the Machine. We danced together and had a great time. Then we planned on seeing Dr. Dre and Snoop together, only her friends wanted to leave RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of dog days, Florence's finale, to get a good spot for Dre and Snoop (go figure). So we plan on meeting up to the left of the sound booth, but the place is ABSOLUTELY PACKED. Asses to elbow. No way I could have gotten there to meet them. I'm not even sure if they managed it. And in my festival haze, I didn't get any contact info. So fuck. My new cute Canadian friend is lost to me. 

But the thing is, she told me she was going to Outside Lands festival in San Francisco this August, and so am I, so we were going to meet up. Now we can't. I don't have much hope of randomly running into her in Outside Lands after seeing how many people were at Coachella. 

**Details:** She had a birthday in March. She is now 26 years old. Her friends' names were Megan, Heather (?), Something like Kaira or Taira (?). She had blonde, kind of frilly hair. Facebook search has been completely useless so far, it only shows one girl named Kirsten in Calgary. Calgary! Help me, please! You're my only hope!

After short explanation he wants to ""Show"" me his gratitude. He now explains he's a upper level management for D&amp;G and has some left over convention swag from his company that he'd like to give me.

Here comes the scam.

Pulls out to what at first to believe real leather jackets with some Italian brand I haven't heard of. Each to be worth 1500+ dollars! But because hes traveling over seas the border wants him to pay duty on every jacket. He believes this to be crap so he wants to give these jackets away to trust worthy citizens he finds on his travels.

Four jackets later hes got me pretty convinced there real (cause I know so much about high end jackets), finish's off with ""But id like to get ma wafe soomin from de airpewrt but i gonna have no money. How about you give me 700 and i can give yew these jackets ina exchange."" Quickly I decline saying I don't have that kind of cash to spend on jackets let alone everyday life. A little put off he say ok no-problemo how about you give me what you can.

Two Hundred dollars later, and a pissed off wife, I've come to realize my mistake.

Long story short, fake leather jackets. From a more then likely fake Italian is trying to make some easy cash on the wood-be good do-ers of our fair city.

I have been seeing a lot of car break ins specifically in the Sunridge mall and Sunridge Spectrum parking lots. We are talking 5 - 10 reports a week. Items stolen are mostly bags, backpacks, cell phones and quick grab electronics. 

This is just a friendly reminder when visiting those (or any parking lot) this time of year to remove your personal belongings and keep an eye out for your fellow Calgarians. One suggestion I have is if you are putting things in your trunk or your car IE: things get to heavy and you are going back into the mall. You should get into your vehicle and move it somewhere else.

Most of these break ins were popping the lock... the repairs alone for this cost around 1000$ in body and mechanical work.

I need your help if you live in Kensington. I drive a gray Mazda Protege. I Park behind the Safeway where 7th and 5th turn into the same street. At 2PM yesterday someone crashed into my car which in turn was pushed into another vehicle collapsing my hood. 

I had a witness tell me they saw it happen and it was a blue 2 door Honda Civic that hit me. The driver would have smashed their front end. The driver took off before the witness got the chance to get the license plate. 

I don't have collision insurance [which in retrospect was a terrible, terrible idea] and my insurance company will not do a thing until i get the license plate of the person who hit me. 

If you know of anything it would be greatly appreciated.

Hey everybody i just wanted to thank you for your concern and for your suggestions.You guys have been awesome, to help a stranger you have never met before. This is why i love reddit.

This time there is a happy ending to the story.

My mother, who is not to be messed with, decided that she would hang out in the neighborhood and wait to see if the shit head came back. Based off of what the witness said [he has seen the car before] she thought he might come back.

Low and behold. the dumb fuck did. At first he started to deny it then eventually fessed up to the crime. He said he was picking up his gf who lives in the area, caused the accident and got freaked out.

I have all of his information and i have the choice to call the police and have him charged or i could just call my insurance company with his information and have them fix it.

I personally witnessed one on Saturday (~3 am Sunday morning) and I believe it is the same person as described [here](http://metronews.ca/news/calgary/319051/police-seeking-suspected-flasher-in-calgarys-southwest/).  I'll explain.


My wife and I were walking home from the bar on Saturday night.  We were walking under the 5th Ave underpass (under the train tracks).  We passed 3 20-23 year old girls walking in the opposite direction.  About 30-40 feet behind them was a single male.  A few things struck me about him which made me stop.  First, he wasn't drunk.  Most people walking around at 3am on a weekend are drunk.  He was also walking with a purpose, you could almost tell he was following these girls.  Third, and here's what makes me think this is the same man from the article above is that he was wearing blue swim shorts.  You don't often see people wearing swim shorts at 3am.

So my wife and I stop and I look back.  I see this man start to pull down his pants, pull them up and run towards the girls.  At this point I realize what is about to happen.  I start running back towards the girls yelling ""Hey....Hey.... "" trying to get their attention. The man fully takes his shorts off (no underwear on) and has them in his hands.  He runs up to the girls and says something then he hears me running and takes off into the alley.  I spoke with the girls about it and they didn't seem to understand what really happened.  I think at first they believed it was just a drunk guy, but after a few minutes they realized what kind of happened.

I regret this, but we didn't call the cops at that time.  I have reported it to police, I met with an officer on Monday.



**So females of reddit, be careful when you are out at night.  This man (I believe to be the same) has exposed himself both downtown and on 37th st SW (which I assume was near MRU).  If you are approached by a man in blue shorts, or any suspicious male, please find a safe place to go and call police!**",,False,self,t5_2qn40,False,,,True,t3_xi7g4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/xi7g4/attention_females_of_calgary_please_read/,

It's not me, it's you. We've had this love/hate relationship for some time now, and you haven't had the guts to end the relationship; sadly neither can I as you have complete control over this ""fling"" of ours.

It's not that I don't enjoy skiing on your freshly powdered surfaces, catching flakes with my tongue, or basking in the eerie calm and quiet of a freshly fallen snow. It's not the frosting on the trees either nor the season that oft finds us in homes of loved ones celebrating the holidays.

No dear winter, it's that you are a poor reader of clear signals that I need time apart. Spring and Summer are my friends, too, as is Autumn, and by hogging the whole year I must say you are being quite selfish.

Save the flakes and crunch of snow and ice for the rest of the year; too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing, and dearest winter, I don't want to hate you.

I know you are misunderstood and lots of people curse your name, never mind them. I can see their point though when sloppy slush puddles spray from tires of ignorant drivers all over the pedestrians on the sidewalks or when those who love biking slip and slide on their daily commute. It's not me, it's you.

So please, dear winter, for the sake of our quarterly relationship, move on for now. We can cool things off together again in November.

Warmly yours,
Me",,False,self,t5_2qn40,False,,,True,t3_1c5mt4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1c5mt4/dear_winterits_not_me_its_you/,

After months of commuting with my older Specialized Cruiser, I decided to save my pennies for a more versatile and adventurous bike. The new bike didn't last me 4 full days!

I parked my bike outside of Hotel le Germaine on 9th Avenue at 7:50am. Locked both wheels and frame to the bike pole. Returned to the location of my bike ready for lunch Yoga at 11:50am to discover my beloved bike was missing. Spoke with the security at the building and was told no cameras pointed in that direction.

There is a bottle holder on the frame and a black bell on the left handle.

Discovered an older blue, [Diamondback Outlook](http://i.imgur.com/Wm0ovvF.jpg) bike parked next to where mine was left, it was not locked and still currently remains there; May have been left there by the thief.

I have filed a report with the police and I have also filed a report with Bike Calgary (www.bikecalgary.org), as well as spending every moment on Kijiji, Pinkbike, and Ebay.

For those who don't understand, we are used to the standard halogen bulb. The halogen bulb is in the reflector to scatter the light outwards in all directions.

New vehicles now have hid bulbs that are placed in a projector to project the light outwards. The projector ensures the light does not shine into say a rear view mirror. It has cutoffs to precisely shine light on the road.

These bulbs are much more powerful than halogen bulbs. Such bulbs were never made or intended or be placed in a reflector housing.

So now we have people driving around like this and outputting this ridiculous light in the faces of fellow drivers. I can't believe I don't see more complaints about this because it seriously impairs other drivers. If you are either behind or coming from ahead it is so dangerous for other drivers.

It is very cheap to do this mod($100-$200max). And you get much better road light obviously. To buy the proper projector with everything it is probably around $250-$400. I ask that if you do have this setup with the hid bulbs in the reflector housing to please educate yourself on the proper aftermarket upgrade, and consider other drivers. I did it myself for $400 with little experience.

It will make the drive for many people much safer. :)

Status Update
By Naheed Nenshi

Good afternoon, folks. I, like many Albertans, am concerned about the recent cuts to post-secondary institutions made by the provincial government. And, as mayor, I think that those cuts can be very damaging to our city. Those cuts have now led to significant programming cuts proposed at Mount Royal University (and it is possible that other post-secondary institutions will follow suit). In response to this, I wrote a letter to the Mount Royal University Board of Governors today. Here is that letter:

April 17, 2013
Mr. Richard Shaw
Chair, Board of Governors
Mount Royal University 

Dear Mr. Shaw,

It is with great concern that I read of the recommendation coming to the Mount Royal University Board of Governors for vertical program cuts. I have been on record as saying that the provincial government has made a terrible error in its post-secondary education policy – great cities need great universities and great universities need government support. No doubt these actions have made your life very difficult. However, I would encourage the leadership of MRU to stand up to the provincial government on behalf of its students, faculty, and community, rather than capitulate to the government’s bad policy. Surely there are alternatives. Sometimes tough times call for innovative thinking—a characteristic that MRU has in abundance. 

It was not quite two years ago that I had the opportunity to return to Mount Royal University for one of the first times since being elected Mayor. The occasion was the groundbreaking for the Bella Concert Hall, designed to be a world-class facility for the performing arts in our city. Its location at Mount Royal was fitting, given that it is – was – home to a premier music performance and theatre arts program. In fact, education rooms were included as part of the facility’s design so that students could learn and perform in the same incredible venue. I was very excited about the Taylor Family’s donation and MRU’s commitment to building what would certainly become a treasured performance space in our city.

So you can imagine my dismay when I heard the news that MRU is considering cutting some of the very programs that this venue was designed to support—and without apparent consultation with the community. These programs are critical for the development of Calgary’s cultural offerings and eliminating them severely inhibits our ability to attract the best and brightest to our city from around the world. I also hope that other potential donors will not be put off by the possibility that the intent of their generosity may be lost to provincial politics. 

Similarly, denying internationally-trained nurses access to a good life in Canada, reducing the number of nurses overall and reducing much-needed engineering student spaces is bad public policy for this province. The associated loss of professionals is a major blow to Calgary.

I look forward to your innovative ways of preserving these programs as much as I look forward to seeing future MRU students take the stage at the Bella Concert Hall. 

Sincerely,
[signed]

Mayor and Associate Professor at the Bissett School of Business (on leave)

She may be bowing to political pressure but this is by far the most regressive thing I've seen come out of Redford and is absolutely disgusting.

[UPDATE],S_Dub7,56,13,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1iyfoz/still_evacuated_one_month_later_update/,"First off I'd like to thank everyone on reddit for the information they've provided, folks who PM'd me with offers of help and information and anyone who took the time to read my story.

I had spoken with Metro News today and here's the first article to get the ball rolling to a resolution. It is also going to be on the front page of July 24th's issue of Metro so make sure to pick it up. What it looks like is us tenants are being blamed for not only the break ins but also that we're responsible for our own security guard and looking after the building, even when we legally aren't allowed to be there, that's what the owner thinks anyway.

http://metronews.ca/news/calgary/746971/still-displaced-calgarians-worry-about-security-future-rental-prospects/

I would also like to thank all my fellow tenants for their support, community spirit and helpfulness through all of what we're going through. My interview with CTV will be happening tomorrow morning and I will make another update post once I get the airing information like dates / times about that interview.

Again, thank you for all the information, support and general good spirit of my fellow tenants, the reddit community and Calgary in general.",,False,self,t5_2qn40,1374676407.0,,,True,t3_1iyfoz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1iyfoz/still_evacuated_one_month_later_update/,

I'm ok with people throwing up their phone for a picture or two, but it gets very distracting for everyone else when you have to peer through 35 phones recording the event.  Do people even go back and watch these mediocre quality videos?  I can't imagine the sound is at all bearable.  

I'm guessing there will be a concert DVD put out at one eventually.  Watch the show, buy the DVD and everyone is happy.

If anyone here has ever tried crossing the city with transit on a regular basis you'll know that it can take over 90 minutes to get to your destination if the weather is bad or if there's an accident. This is longer than tickets/transfers are valid for.

2. Walking from my house to take the train one stop costs $2.75 unless I risk it and not pay the fair (no middle ground)

3. And I'm convinced that many bus drivers don't own watches. My bus route is a simple loop through a suburban community. No traffic lights, and 2+ timed stops. How on earth can it run 5 minutes early? (This according to the CT phone system). And then when I miss it, I need to wait 30 minutes until the next bus, or walk 12 minutes to the train station, which makes the bus useless.

******

I just looked at the website for the [CONNECT](http://www.calgarytransit.com/html/connect.html) system that's coming soon... and it doesn't solve #1 or #2.

Maybe our buses need GPS. Maybe the drivers need to focus on sticking to their schedules. Maybe the new Connect system needs to utilize a distance payment system. I use transit so often, yet it still annoys the hell out of me on a regular basis.

I love r/Calgary and frequently come here to check and see what is up with my fellow redditors from the planet C-town. It's awesome to think of all of you out there, walking among us. However there are some things I have noticed lately in this subreddit that are starting to bug me.
 
I've noticed a lot of people downvoting posts/comments that they disagree with. I know its kind of a thing that's affecting all of reddit, but I think for r/Calgary it is particularly damaging since its usually a quiet subreddit. I think many people (including myself) have been turned off contributing in fears of people downvoting their submissions. Too many lurkers and not enough contributors make a dead subreddit.
 
I also notice a lot of arguing/personal attacks/and just meanie meanie bo beanies. This also might turn people off submitting. I am all for debate and discussion, but I am noticing people just being plain rude and not offering anything to the discussion. Keep in mind that Calgary isn't that big and the chances of you seeing that person face to face are quite high, especially at meetups. Would you want to say that sort of thing to their face? Just some thoughts.
 
And the final thing that has given me some red flags are posting names of people when it is inappropriate. There was a post a while ago about that girl from Medicine Hat that killed her family. I didn't think it was appropriate for people to list her name and give out that kind of information. A lot of reddits enforce that posting names and contact information is prohibited and will result in a ban. I think that we should respect that idea here. 
 
Well those are just some things that I think are not good for our community here. I am hoping if we become more accepting of different things, we will have more submissions. You can take my opinions or leave them, or downvote me if you wish. I like this subreddit and have been to one meetup and it was a blast. There are some cool people on here.

As one of the artsvote volunteers that was there to ask some questions I had a front row seat to all the fireworks.  

McCourt was perhaps a little offside with some of his questions...but in all honesty...that's what he DOES.  Barb should have done her homework and been prepared for the harsh line of questioning.

Barb did a decent job ON-AIR...but the real story happened after she walked off set.

The artsvote group was standing by talking about the segment, when Barb walked up to us.  I assumed that she was going to thank us for our questions, and answer any more that we may have. (I was informed by the producer that previously that is what the other candidates had done).

I did not expect what happened next.  After asking ""who crapped in everyones cornflakes this morning"" Higgins got aggressive.  She proclaimed that ""you should be ashamed of how you treat people"" and angrily abused us for asking some open and honest questions.

This is a stark contrast to the image that she attempts to maintain on camera, and has left me stunned at the discrepancy.  She was rude, arrogant, and left us all standing there shocked.  
  
Unfortunately she is apparently unaware of the power of social media.  There is no 'off-camera' anymore....with twitter lighting up about the issue moments after it happened.

Barb has been billed as the 'nice' and 'positive' candidate.  A warning to all her supporters....make sure you bring a camera if you ever meet her...otherwise you may get a harsh surprise....I certainly did. 

**EDIT**: Barb has issued an apology.  Which does show that she has class.  Although I do maintain that we didn't show contempt (it was 730 in the morning!! Could have been a yawn...) I do admire her for admitting that she was at least some part in the wrong.  Perhaps it was all a misunderstanding that could have been cleared up with a conversation.

I've been living in Calgary on and off for the last 24 years. In my circle of friends we find ourselves saying ""Nothing's open past 5 PM in this zombie town"" or ""I wish there was a cool place we could go hang out,"" but it just seems like the only option for Calgarians is getting drinks at some pub. No hole-in-the-wall bluesy hangouts, no outdoor inner-city parks that promote night-life, nada.  

Truly, without the intention to offend, I can't help but feel like Calgary is void of culture. At least for people with any interest in creativity. I'm not saying Calgary should be Vancouver, or (God-forbid, from the reviews I've heard, Toronto) or even New York or London, because it never will be. Those cities have had hundreds of years on us to develop socially, and that's just fine because it means that ***we*** (people our age, possibly new to Calgary or born and raised here), the socially connected generation, will get to decide where this city goes.

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on any of these, these are my complaints as far as I understand the issue.

It's stated in their [""Pledge""](http://www.wildrose.ca/pledge/read-the-pledge/) that they plan to ""Ensure there are no barriers to education by banning all mandatory fees in public, Catholic, and public charter schools."" 
The issue I have with this is twofold, first, why should schools with religious affiliation, which have mandatory bible study courses as part of their teaching curriculum receive the same government subsidies as schools which have a purely academic curriculum? (I could be misinformed on this, maybe this is already the case?)

The second part of this that bothers me is that they have all these plans to reduce deficit and balance the budget, removing school fees and therefore increasing government expenditures on education seems a bit out of line from this plan to me. If it was me, I would instead slightly increase the fees and waive them for those families in financial situations which prevent them from paying. (Theoretically this would reduce the necessary expenditures while also protecting those children in low income families.)

**Their Pledge** further states that they will ""cut billions in wasteful spending such as [carbon capture and storage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage) maybe I'm wrong yet again, but isn't CCS supposed to be a good thing for offsetting the environmental effects of power generation and other processes which emit massive amounts of CO2? Maybe the current government is overspending on this, I don't know, but to me this is a good thing and something that Alberta needs to continue doing to protect the environment for the future.

They have also proposed a similar plan to the ""Kleinbucks"" of years past in which every man, woman, and child would receive a $300 cheque from government surplus. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for getting money from the government, this just doesn't seem in line with their plans for long term financial growth of Alberta, $300 for most albertans is a couple nights at the bar, or maybe a new TV if they combine these cheques, where it's actually an amount of money that could easily be invested if the surplus was kept by the government with a plan to invest it long term.


Again, I don't claim to be right about all of this, feel free to correct me where I'm wrong, but let's have a discussion about this.

*Edit: I just thought of another talking point I felt could be added here. What if instead of giving every Albertan $300 or so, with minimal impact, that money was invested in alternative fuel sources? I know no party will have a successful election in Alberta on a platform that involves the words ""alternative"" and ""energy"" in a sentence other than ""There is no alternative to oil for energy."" but to me planning for the inevitable downfall and using some of the absurd amount of money in the province to become pioneers in a growing field makes perfect sense.",,False,self,t5_2qn40,True,,,True,t3_sht5s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/sht5s/maybe_im_wrong_but_a_lot_of_what_the_wildrose/,

I might as well go look around my truck, maybe It fell out of my pocket when I got out.

We're sad to let you know that our South America building, one of the oldest buildings at the zoo, was so severely damaged by the flood that it's not worth fixing. As a result, we're going to have to relocate the animals that made their home there.

 Our President and CEO, Dr. Clément Lanthier, explains:

“Sadly this means we have to quickly find new homes for the 34 individual animals representing 11 species that were housed in this building.We know people will be sad that these animals are leaving us, but we need to think of their welfare and we simply can’t provide for their long-term needs in the foreseeable future.”

While exact locations are being finalized, the zoo expects the animals to begin moving within the next two weeks. These animals include:
• 2 Hyacinth macaws
• 7 Yellow-headed Amazon parrots
• 2 Prehensile-tailed porcupines
• 2 Two-toed sloths
• 2 Giant anteaters
• 2 Andean condors
• 5 Goeldi's monkeys
• 3 Cotton-topped tamarins
• 2 White-handed gibbons
• 4 Black-handed spider monkeys
• 3 Debrazza monkeys

Prior to the flood, the zoo was looking for new homes for several other animals which will bring the total of animals to be moved to 45 individuals representing 15 species.

Dr. Lanthier concludes that ""this is the sad reality that we face – the Calgary Zoo has been forever changed by the flood on June 21st, but with the support of our community, we will eventually be able to replace these ruined facilities and create a new Calgary Zoo that is even better than before.""

1311132644.0,42,self.Calgary,iuh6k,Shaw GMC tried to cheat us out money for buying new car. GM said they cannot do anything for us either. ,Ehynxs,49,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/iuh6k/shaw_gmc_tried_to_cheat_us_out_money_for_buying/,"First of all the link to a picture of the contract (It has been slightly edited for confidentiality): http://imageshack.us/f/269/img0022wu.jpg/

Hey fellow Redditors. Here's a bit of a shocker. My Aunt who has decided to purchase a car, went to Shaw GMC. This is the contract they have both signed and agreed upon how the car would be paid off. A couple weeks passed and as my Aunt returned back to Canada (She is a business women, often traveling from Asia to North America), expecting her car to be ready on the 18th of July 2011. Not only was the car not ready after inquiry that morning (No responses either after several messages were left, that is until she complained). They told her to come get it later that day.

 Things were not bad so far. The kicker comes from the final contract that needed to be signed for the car to be 100% hers. The contract she would've signed if she wasn't careful would've increased her interest by about 6 times of what it would've been (If you look at the picture of the contract it clearly states 0.9% for 5 years, the new one had 6.99% for 84 months). Of course this could've been a mistake right?

Wrong. They increased her payment period from 60 months to 84 months so the bi-weekly payments looked about the same. She would have lost over 4000 dollars had she signed the new contract. They wanted her to sign it quick, to quickly make the first contract she signed null and void. Now they're pulling out all the stops to kill this contract. Latest try today, was when the manger of Shaw GMC called her in (This is after we complained to the Company's Customer Service Ambassador - GM, we had her phone number, name, and everything). After a while of 'discussing' of a solution amongst themselves, the brilliant idea was that my father would be the purchaser and my aunt would be a co-buyer. Of course this required them to sign a new contract, which again would make the first one my aunt had null and void. 

The reason why they want to kill her first contract is because they themselves screwed up making the first contract. The other contracts offered would have had her pay more to cover up their sorry mistakes. After all this hassle, and no solution, the Manger of Shaw GMC wanted to give my aunt the 500 dollar deposit back and forget about the whole thing. 

So as one can see, their staff not only can lie, but are totally unhelpful when the situation arises. The Customer Service Ambassador - GM, has also told us they are independent from their dealers, so they have no control over their dealers, who sell their cars, and told us there was nothing they could do about it.

Help me spread the word my friends, at how outrageous these turns of events are. I'm helping my aunt spread just how trustworthy Shaw GMC truly is. If they can try to cheat my aunt, why not cheat everyone? Take a stand with me. This kind of act from a large company cannot and should not be tolerated.

You have my thanks.

TL:DR: Don't trust Freakin Shaw GMC, they might lie to you, they might try to cheat you, and there's nothing you can do after. Double check all your future contracts from this bogus company.


EDIT: We have been to the BBB, but the final straw came today. The manager himself wanted to just throw us back the deposit we paid for the car so it would seem like nothing happened ever. The nerve of these guys. They also have seemed to misplaced the credit information on which my Aunt used to pay for the deposit and had to go back to ask her through email. We are now seeking legal action at the moment.

There is a guy who works there who really knows his beers, and I've chatted with him about my favorite brewery, Unibrou in Quebec, before. They have an annual beer passport program where you could collect stamps for the craft brews you buy and bring them in for awesome beer glasses and steins.

I never remember to bring mine and had two going.

They are usually nice and let me consolidate the ones I've gathered across multiple books, so tonight, I remembered to bring mine and asked the guy there about the program because I can never remember when it's going or not. Turns out they ended that program altogether and replaced it with a program where you get coupons off future beer purchases, which is awesome, because yay more beer. Sadly, this means they discontinued the awesome glass and stein project.

Not sure if my disappointemnt showed on my face, but the guy there, without missing a beat, said ""Hold on, I think we have a couple steins left. Let me get them for you."" Free beersteins? Just cause? O_O

Sure enough, guy pulled out two boxes. and just straight-up gave them to me. I ran back to excitedly figure out what I wanted to christen them with. I ended up getting a Philips combo pack and a Trois Pistols.

[Picture I uploaded to twitter](https://twitter.com/RogueMoravec/status/356253305971802113/photo/1)

Anyway, that's all. I've already plowed through my Trois Pistols and am onto the Philips' wheat beer. Girlfriend had a cream ale in hers. Thanks co-op guy for making my weekend.

True story. 

Now, I'm going to have to pay more for less service... much less service. How is Calgary Transit so broken? I'm willing to let it slide that the buses are never on time (seriously, what's the point of the schedules if the drivers take breaks or don't bother to be on time?), that downtown service is usually cut on the weekends, that the drivers too often take breaks in the middle of their routes or stop for coffee, that getting out of a train is an uphill battle against a horde that will force you back inside the train or completely block your way out (which, by the way, would earn you a free punch in the face in Toronto), that getting on a train is a gamble on whether or not it will break down before finishing its route, but this week Calgary Transit really pushed me. Not once, not twice, but three, count 'em three times (two bus drivers and one train driver during the NE disruption earlier this week) has a Calgary Transit driver looked me in the eye before closing the doors on my face and driving away. First, let me say, real fucking classy. Second, just why is this system such shit?

Instead of investing in a subway line, we're paying to expand the stations. Great job, what's going to happen when Calgary keeps growing in five years? Expand them all again, it's stupid. This winter I'm buying a car, I really didn't want to, but I just can't deal with Calgary Transit. I can't rely on them to get me to work, even if the schedule says it's doable, I have zero faith anymore that the train or bus might actually even be mechanically fit to make it to the end of the route without breaking down on the way, that it'll show up on time, that the driver will actually let me on, that it won't cost more again next year, etc etc etc... /endrant (and a polite apology - sorry)

Anyways, I tried, Calgary. I really, really tried. I took the TTC growing up all my life and never had to deal with anything like this, my friends back east can't believe the stories I tell them. Once, one time (in Toronto) I remember a driver ran out for a coffee and the people waiting inside almost tore his limbs off for it. Here, I have to deal with all of these things almost every day. I really wanted to keep taking the transit, I really, honestly did, I'm just not willing to risk my job anymore on whether or not these daily inconveniences will lessen.

So, anybody else have grievances about Calgary Transit? Amusing anecdotes? I'll even happily listen to good stories about the transit.

Sunday: Get home from hanging out with some family, and my uncle has left a wonderful eviction notice on my door. I gave up an awesome rental ($800/mo entire house, pets allowed) last August to move in with my grandma to take care of her. She put my uncles name on the title to the house when my grandpa died, and now, suddenly, I'm not taking good enough care of her. So now, crippled, I get to look for a new place that will take 2 dogs, 2 cats myself and my husband before July 1. And I get to live with said uncle until that time too (mmmm, basement microwaved food for 6 weeks, unless I want to head up to the kitchen and have some fun family time). 

/rant

Anyway, I need some actual advice on what to do. My husbands parents can take our dogs for a few weeks if we need. I've emailed some of the local animal rescue shelters about taking our cats in short term (offered to pay food/litter and make a donation). The best thing I can think of is to look for a short term rental for July/August while we look for a house. We were planning on buying soon (only $2k saved, but we paid off all other debts, so now we can save roughly $2.5k a month if we don't have rent). Anyone have any suggestions? I've never been in this position in my entire life before. I've been on my own since I was 17, and always had a roof over my head. I feel fucking terrible for my husband, as he wasn't keen on giving up our place to stay with my grandma. He was worried something like this would happen, though I was genuinely shocked that my grandma would allow my uncle to do this to me. I'm not sure if I could qualify for Calgary Housing short term, or what other emergency shelter options there are out there. I can obviously afford a place to rent, but the less we pay the faster we can buy a place. We don't mind renting again, long term, but it would have to allow our pets. 

And no, I can't ask my parents for help - Dad died and my step mom got everything (this is his family I'm dealing with right now). My mom lives in a 40+ complex. 

*Edit: Some of your tips made me think of the UofC campus. Looks like I can get spring/summer residence rooms for not that expensive. Now I just have to worry about where the cats will go, and my furnishings. Anyone know of a cheap storage facility?

*Edit 2: UofC housing was per person, so WAY out of a reasonable price range. I'll keep looking at room rentals for now. If anyone knows of a short term place for July-Aug, PM me :)

*Edit 3: Success on the cat front! Oops-a-dazy (animal rescue I've fostered for and adopted from) can take the cats if needed. Decent family said they should be able to take us in for a few weeks come July too. Now the hunt for a part time job is on...oh wait, I'm still crippled :(

I was on my way in to work, changing trains downtown. I got onto my McKnight bound train and, thank goodness, saw an opens eat on one of the benches. My back is a wreck, so I need to sit, but I'm 6'7"" so I'm always in people's way if I sit in the non-bench seats. I digress... the empty seat in the middle of one of the benches is flanked by an older gentleman (or so I thought anyway, read on) and a lady of a similar age to myself (I assume). Between them was a man's hat, so I politely asked the man if I could have the seat occupied by his hat. He stared at me agape. So I said ""sir, it's a three person seat, may I please sit there"". He continued to stare and at this point the lady (bless her) offered me her seat. So I thanked her and plunked down. This will not stand, apparently, as the old guy then reaches under his shirt and starts waving his cross at me! So I looked at him for a few seconds, asked him if that's how he thought Jesus would act, and then opened my novel. He kept staring daggers at me and waving this cross at me for the whole journey, so by Marlborough, my stop, I had had enough... so out with the ear buds playing Fur Elise, away with the Forgotten Realms novel (all my good books are packed, I'm reduced to reading from the Value Village bound pile) and off come the shades. I look this ""gentleman"" square in the eye and said:

""Judge not lest ye be judged, do unto others as you would have them do unto you, you are an embarrassment to humanity!""

and stormed off the train... I feel bad for reacting this way... Hel, I feel bad for reacting at all, I'd like to think I'm above letting people like that get to me... but people hiding hatred and bigotry behind what should be a symbol of love, compassion and humanity just raises my hackles...

I don't get it. People buy houses near a rail yard (presumably because values are lower, as a result of the rail yard), and now they want to complain/shut down the rail yard. You must be kidding me.

Same thing happened at Race City. Cheap houses on the outskirts of the planned dump location and Race City. After a few years, the new home buyers complain about the noise. Really. Complaining about race track noise after you buy a house near a race track.

Sorry but it's infuriating. I live near train tracks where trains operate at speeds up to 80kmph including start ups. You get used to it. Really is NOT a big deal.

I just wanted to let you know about a really cool star gazing opportunity coming up next week:

[Milky Way Nights at the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (RAO)](http://ucalgary.ca/rao/)

On the nights of Aug 26-28, the RAO will be open the public for late night (10pm-2am) stargazing.  There will be small, amateur astronomy telescopes set up for stargazing, and the large scientific telescopes will be open for tours and probably running as well.  It'll be right around the new moon, so there should be lots of good things to see: the Milky Way should be visible to the naked eye, there should be lots of star clusters and nebulae viewable, Jupiter and it's moons should be up, and with a bit of luck we might even get to see the International Space Station.

The observatory is located south of the city, near Priddis. It's about a 20 minute drive or so from the south end of the city, or 45 minutes from the University campus.  We have a number of working telescopes, including one of the largest telescopes in Canada, plus an interpretive center with information displays.

I'm a bit biased (as an astronomy student), but I think it's a fantastically fun event.\*  It's a great chance to stargaze and see a working scientific observatory.

\* (Subject to the weather. We usually have pretty good luck in getting clear skies. We're still open if it's cloudy, but we can't promise fantastic fun.)

Details, and driving directions are on the website (linked above).  If you are able to come, try to track down a tall guy with a name badge that says 'Radio Astronomer'; there's at least a 50% chance that that's me (the other tall radio astronomer, if he's there, is also a cool guy). If my volunteer duties permit, I'd be glad to offer personal tours, or provide opportunities to run one of the science 'scopes.

The RAO also runs Open House events every month for the public.  If there's any interest, I can post the announcements for them here in the future.",,False,self,t5_2qn40,False,,,True,t3_jnz4g,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/jnz4g/cool_stargazing_event_next_week_at_the_rothney/,

The driver was long gone and I only vaguely remember the vehicle -a light coloured CUV.  I don't think it's anyone I know.  The vehicle certainly wasn't familiar to me.  

I really didn't know what to do.  I've never been in this kind of situation before.  I must have looked like a fool because the employee asked if I was going to pay for someone else as I already had my coffee and snack and hadn't pulled away yet.  There wasn't anyone in line behind me that I could pay for so I gave the Starbucks girl the cash I had set aside for my order and asked that it be put towards whoever came after me.

This may not seem like a grand gesture to many people but this really lifted my spirits.  I had a smile on my face the whole ride into work -and I'm usually miserable until at least my second coffee of the day.  What a great way to start the day.

I grew up in Calgary, and I am a die-hard Flames fan. I run a blog called www.davesgeekyideas.com. I've been living in Vancouver for the last 8 years. I recently posted a Skytrain Map for Vancouver in the Super Mario 3 style (very popular: http://davesgeekyideas.com/2011/09/07/vancouver-skytrain-map-super-mario-3-style/)

Now I'd like to make one for my hometown. I am using this for reference: http://www.calgarytransit.com/route_maps/lrt_stop.html

That map is correct? I'm pretty sure I can verify which are transfer and terminus stations. The routes are known simply as 201 and 202? Olympic Plaza stop is now dead?

Because of the grid-like nature of the Mario 3 map, I'm trying to determine the best layout for the NW route. Any feedback would be appreciated.

I hope to have a map done in the next few weeks.
