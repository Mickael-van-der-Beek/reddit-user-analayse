1329731144.0,130,self.MLPdrawingschool,pxmj9,The basics. Pony anatomy and undersketching.  ,viwrastupr,160,30,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/pxmj9/the_basics_pony_anatomy_and_undersketching/,"Hello everypony.  [](/flutteryay ""Its time for another tutorial with your second favorite mod,"")[](/flutterfear ""v-vi--viw---viwrspartarasrtgftssakjhlgasjj...."")[](/fluttersrs ""ah, screw it."")  I'm here to teach you some stuff about how ponies are put together in the show.  Or, at least the basics.

Ponies are put together with an undersketch.  What's an undersketch?  [Well, they look like this](http://imgur.com/a/BTVfB).  It looks like crap, doesn't it?  Well, it is supposed to, its not the final piece.  You see, what an undersketch does is provide the *foundation* on which the rest of the pony's body, placement, angles, proportions, and everything really depends on.  

Now let's take a closer look at that undersketch.  A pony body is made up of two ***intersecting*** circles.  A larger one for the rump and a smaller one for the chest.  Now what about the limbs, where do those lines come from? [I link to this guide a lot and the limbs are why](http://vertrev.deviantart.com/art/AMG-so-much-pony-201791308).  Each line represents a pony's bone and where they change direction, a joint.  By placing these lines in first, you can figure out the placement and proportions of the legs and their joints.  

By doing these simple few lines and circles, you let yourself be able to draw and recorrect, draw and recorrect until its in the right spot and at the right place.  [](/fluttershy ""Correct, recorrect... got it.  But how?"")

Let's take the back legs for instance.  They have an angle that is difficult for most to see on their first few pony arts.  Look at [the angle the back line of the back leg is making in these pictures](http://imgur.com/a/vzBB8).  It comes out.  *Not in*.  Out.  In all flatfooted situations in the show this is the case.  **Back legs are neither straight nor forward, they come out, away from the body.**---  This creates untold interest, it leads the viewer into the body instead of down away from it.  

Now that we know this, let's apply it to the undersketch.  [Take a look at the next iteration](http://imgur.com/5KGD3).  We used the leg undersketch, and what we know about angles to map in the next part.  But what's with all those random lines?   That is measuring.  When drawing from a reference, in order to make sure you're getting the angle right hold a pencil up to the reference and measure angles between various outside points.  Part of the undersketch can be mapping out these angles.  This really helps you to nail placement and proportions.  [](/fluttershh ""This doesn't seem so bad... wait, is this how we recorrect?"")

A quick interlude here about the hoof joint.  Look again at that album of screenshots.  The hoof joint is not straight down (contrary to vertrev's guide).  Hooves have a tilt to them that adds an extra bit of flourish to the pony leg curve and allows them to move anatomically.  Keep this in mind, and so help me if I see you do that, I'll link you right back here I will.  

Now let's move on to eyes.  For a lot of people, eyes are very difficult.  They are complex, but also take a lot of precision as we really look at them as viewers to get a good read on the pony's mood and emotions. [Take a look at this](http://imgur.com/tQlyP).

Wait... what the heck is that, those aren't eyes?  Well... No.  But those are how you map out the eyes.  The tops of the eyes should be even and so should the bottom.  These lines follow along the overall tilt for the head.  This is true for the irises as well, if you can see their bottoms.  Usually the top of the iris is covered by the eyelid, even if just a sliver.  This is true in humans too.  Unless we're looking down, far to the side or are Pinkie Pie excited, the tippy top of your iris is covered up by the eyelid.  

What else did I do there?  I changed all sorts of things around.  The hooves are longer, the hair less square.  How did I know to do this?  Simple, I drew more measuring guiding lines and found out I was wrong.  Its okay to be wrong.  Its expected.  The mature thing to do is to admit your fault and do your best to fix it.  Fixing is really quick once you have your guiding lines.  You've already drawn the shape once before, so use it as a general guide and fix the placement and proportions to fit your guiding lines.  Bigger, smaller, different angle or different curve.  With a reference and guiding lines in tow it becomes all the more easier.  

For completeness's sake, [here is what the eyes look like slightly more finished](http://imgur.com/SxMet).  By sticking to the guidelines and saying to myself hmm... the iris starts about a third of the way down this box and the curve here starts right after the corner I was able to correctly place the eyes as a whole. [](/flutterwink ""No one said art was easy, but with practice time, and some amount of advice, you'll get there."")  

Some notes on pony proportions and general anatomy tips:  

* Their bodies are tiny.  Two intersecting circles after all.  

* They are very tall (taller than their body is long).  And their necks are quite short in most circumstances.

* Their hair takes up a huuuuuge amount of space.  Poofy hair.  POOF!  People usually make their OC's without poof and with humanized hair.  This makes me a sad pony... don't make me a sad pony.  Be aware.  Spread the poof.  

* A pony's jawline (the part below the mouth) changes.  While in general a pony [has a flat and horizontal jawline](http://imgur.com/H2V1m) when their mouth's are open, [the jaw angles up and into the body](http://imgur.com/bHx4v).  After all, the jaw hooks right below the ears in mammals.  We just don't see the line go all the way in because the crease doesn't go that far.  

* Ponies have very small and rounded muzzles.  There is no point at the end and to make a point draws attention away from the eyes in a way that is very... sad.  They're also barely there, just a bump at the bottom of the eyes.

* Their ears are not a triangle like a cat's, but more like a football with a quarter of it missing where it attaches.  The inside of a pony's ear is [about half as long as the outside](http://imgur.com/DcCZ6) in most views.
[](/twismile ""So very much to learn!"")
* Pony eyes are quite distinct.  They are elliptical, and at an angle, and when in 3/4 view they loose width, but not height.  Check out the twismile emote.  Her far eye is very thin, and her near eye not a circle, but an interesting series of curves... Hence why we map things out.  

Now, we've covered the circles that make up a pony, their joints, the way their front hooves and legs bend, how to map out eyes and to never fear correction and also a lot of anatomy.  That's a lot of pony and there's always more.  So as always, feel free to ask questions, voice concerns, make jokes or quietly reply.  [](/fluttershy ""Oh my... there's just to much...

Earlier a new artist, Leo986, gave me the idea of doing this after they said that they don't understand undersketches, even though they read the [guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/pxmj9/the_basics_pony_anatomy_and_undersketching/). So, What better way to explain than to show?

For ease of use I've compiled every image I'm going to use in [this Imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/LqREG), with [this Applejack](http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/1/11/Applejack_bucking_apples_S1E12.png) as reference. I'll go through each image and explain the basic steps I took in detail. [](/rdj ""These shades hide how tired I am"")

Let's get started! Pencils and paper ready, everypony!

___

**[Image One](http://i.imgur.com/DmJMr.jpg) - The Circles.**

[](/rb11 ""Easy-peasy."") Here, we have a circle. This will be the head. You will measure a lot of the pony from this one circle, so make sure it's an appropriate size to work with. You'll notice it's accompanied by two smaller circles. The one just below the head circle is the chest circle, and the one further back and slightly larger is the rump circle.

* Measure the size of the chest circle with the head circle; you should find that it's about 2/3 the head circle.

* The top of the rump circle should also be about in-line with the bottom of the head circle. Go ahead, measure it again.

* Notice how both circles overlap. The body is a lot smaller than you think. The width of both circles together should be about 1 1/3 the head circle, so measure once more to make sure.

___

**[Image Two](http://i.imgur.com/hZtgJ.jpg) - Body**

[](/b24 ""Ah'm followin' so far..."")Here, you join those circles, and create an outline of the body, specifically the neck/chest and the back/rump. Look at the chest. It's pretty far in from the chest circle, right? The circles are *not* absolute shapes to go from. Change whatever needs changing.

Here's where you start to draw the legs. Again, measure by that head circle; The legs are surprisingly close to body length, at 1 1/3 head circles. My back legs are pretty stylized, as you can judge from the reference, so don't take this as the absolutely correct way to draw them. Notice how the legs are pretty long and the body is pretty thin; I don't care. Neither should you. Right now, I just care about them being in the right place.

Also notice how I drew the closer two legs instead of the front two/rear two. More often than not, this pairing will be on the same/similar planes. I call these the 'foreground legs'. A good way to remember this is to look at a pony from the show; The further legs, or at least the further rear leg, will be slightly shaded.

___

**[Image Three](http://i.imgur.com/R6vYX.jpg) - Body: Refinement**

[](/b07 ""Uh, yeah, Ah'm still with ya..."")

* (1) Do you see that line? Yes, the one *running through* the arm. A lot of you are drawing the leg and *then* drawing the chest and stomach as separate lines. This is just... it's wrong. Draw that line right through the leg. *Why?* Because drawing the lines separately leads them to look separate, as if the body's ribcage is broken. Visualize the chest behind the leg, faze the leg out of view, look *though* it. It's just one curve.

* (2) I've said the body was too thin and the legs too long, so I changed them. *How did I see this?* I put my pencil down, and I looked. I stared at my piece as a whole. When you're drawing you tend to get lost in the little space your currently working on, and so the whole composition is thrown off. This is the main reason new artists' pieces look 'wrong' or 'off'. Stop, take a step back and assess the piece so far. It will save you either a lot of time and effort later, or a lot of grief. either way, it's a bonus.

So what do we have so far? We've almost got a basic pony! Just one leg... I hate that leg. *The far rear leg*. I despise it so. But wait! How do we know it's fine to move on? That's right; We *measure*! That head circle is still clearly visible without any annoying ears or muzzles in the way, so let's use it again. Everything seems to check out, so let's move on to the face.

___

**[Image Four](http://i.imgur.com/CfObB.jpg) - Head: The 'Cross'**

[](/b05 ""That's not helpful, noob!"")The 'Cross'. Used mainly for placing the muzzle, eye and ear in side-view, but this is 3/4 view! *Why is this artistic noob giving me irrelevant advice?* Because, it's not irrelevant. No, you can't use this to place the muzzle or eye, but the ear can still be placed. Pretend this is a compass, the ear normally joins at points NE and E, so let's try that.

___
**[Image Five](http://i.imgur.com/n0mra.jpg) - Head: The Ear**

[](/c04 ""What."")There's nothing to really measure the ear against - Or is there? The points. Draw a line from point NE straight to the right, and a line from E straight up. the lines will cross, but keep going. use this middle point as a kind of mirror, and copy the length passed the intersection. *That's complicated!* Sorry, look at the ear, you'll see what I mean. The top point is directly above E and the furthest part of the curve is directly inline with NE.

___

**[Image Six](http://i.imgur.com/nelG5.jpg) - Head: The muzzle and further eye**

[](/a05 ""Ah know this part! Easy-peasy, like Ah said!"")Look at the image first. Okay, had a look? Just under where the horizontal and vertical face-lines meet, I've drawn an 'X'. This is the start of the muzzle. Start here if you're not already doing that in your drawings. ALWAYS. then curve to 'Triangle', and then to 'Square'. This muzzle is pretty poor and I correct it later, but this is the general shape. Experiment. That eraser's not going to sit there.

Starting back at the 'X', make a really oval-like curve up, round, and down. As faces turn, on anything, the further eye is always squished, thinned, while the closer eye is more round. Normally, such as when drawing people, you start with the closer, rounder eye, but for ponies I generally find this way easier. Keep the thinness in mind! I mean *thin*! Look at the reference again, it's super thin compared to the other eye. Like the muzzle, I fix the eye later, and I make it slightly thinner than this.

___

**[Image Seven](http://i.imgur.com/XcPR8.jpg) - Head: Closer Eye**

[](/e07 ""Teach us correctly, noob!"" You're confusin'!)This eye is simple, yet complicated. I don't exactly know how to explain this eye. It's generally lower than the further eye in the show, but I like to draw them level. This helps *me* find it's size, already knowing it's height and that it's supposed to be much thicker and rounder than the other eye, but it's merely how I approach the eyes. What definately happens, though, is that the bottom of this eye always falls beneath the tip of the muzzle. Get a ruler or something, make it horizontal and check If that's correct in your piece.

Notice how it's an oval, and it's tilted backwards towards the ear. There are certain differences, like between Rarity's eye and Applejack's, but this 'leaned-oval' style is true to pretty much every pony in the show.

___

**[Image Eight](http://i.imgur.com/ccqFq.jpg) - Hair placement**

[](/a00 ""Pfft. So hard."")Quickly make the general shape of the head mane/neck mane/tail. Just the vague shape of it, don't bother with the little points yet. Get the general shape down. Look at Reference Applejack's neck mane; she has a silky, curvy, almost triangular neck mane while mine is a quick triangle-circle hybrid shape. Also the little points that curve round so awesomely aren't even in my shape. I've noted the points in the tail with little lines, though, while still keeping that basic round shape. The head mane stands too tall here, and the tail sticks out way too far and it overall quite bulky, but again, I took a step back and I *noticed* these things, and I fixed them. And now, after sketching, stopping, looking, erasing, sketching some more, erasing some more until I was satisfied, we arrive at my last image.

___

**[Image Nine](http://i.imgur.com/VX27N.jpg) - Refinement and Cleaning up**

[](/b01 ""Get out'a mah head!"")Stop right there, I think I know exactly what you're thinking; *How did you go from Image Eight all the way to Image Nine? It's such a massive leap!* No, it's not. Look back at Image Eight; All this is is a cleaner version, with the erasing/sketching I was talking about. I thought the tail was too bulky, so I trimmed it down. The hooves here angled strangely like she was standing on a hill, so I flattened the bottoms out. The haunches were really short and the flank came down really far, so I raised the hock (that little point at the back of the leg) to stomach-level. I added the little points and lines in her mane/tail. It is not as big a leap as you think. That far rear leg still looks wrong, but I just hate that leg with a passion. The rump looked way too high, so I moved it down and in turn had to erase the whole refined tail and redraw it a little lower - no big deal. It looks correct now. The piece looks correct, anatomically and proportionally. All thanks to the **undersketch** and me stopping and taking a look at my piece every now and then.

___

[](/a03 ""And Ah didn't learn a thing!"")Well, there you have it. This is my demonstration of the undersketching guide through my own unique style. I hope you gained a better understanding of undersketches and planning a piece as a whole, and I also hope it will reflect in your future pieces.

1325323196.0,81,self.MLPdrawingschool,nxdpy,DON'T PANIC.  A drawing guide.  From beginner to expert and everything in between.,viwrastupr,95,14,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/nxdpy/dont_panic_a_drawing_guide_from_beginner_to/,"The number one and most important thing to remember when drawing is: **Art isn't made in a vacuum**.  Expecting to magically just know how to draw ponies without ever having copied a reference is like expecting to magically know math without instruction or books.  You'd have to create every single math theorum that everyone has ever made or you'd like to know from scratch.  It takes critiques, feedback, referencing, and more.  Most of all- it takes practice.  Practice practice practice.  **Make bad art.  Make mistakes.**  Its the only way to learn.  You can't and shouldn't ever expect yourself or your art to be perfect.  

Taking criticism is hard.  I used to equate critiques as akin to putting one's face in a blender.  Now, I starve for them.  It sucks to have something you poured your heart and soul into ripped apart in front of you.  What you have to realize is that: A. we are only trying to help you learn more so you can get better and B. we aren't attacking you personally *Ever*.  

There are many common problems, here's what they are, why they occur and what you can do to train yourself away from them.  

**1. Common thoughts**


a.  The Horizontal problem.  

All the other problems here come from this problem.  We all have a habit of wanting things to be straight, up and down... orderly. This is an especially true desire for the brain when creating.  This is silly. Unfortunately to add insult to injury our eyes are trained to follow straight and horizontal and vertical lines.  We follow them right off the page.  Horizontal and vertical lines aren't necessarily bad, but just be aware of when you are using them.  To contrast, diagonal and curved lines are more dynamic and add movement and interest to a piece.  They aren't a goal necessarily, because too much can be a distraction.


b. Stiff, blocky looking figures. 

This is almost like the horizontal problem.  Making figures straight up and down (The legs go down, head faces forward, eyes looking straight ahead) makes the figure look boring.  There's no interest.  Try and make the head at a different angle from the body which is at a different angle from the legs.  Vary things up.  Variety is the spice of life.  


   c. Symmetry.

This is hard here because you're working from a cartoon and they're pretty symmetrical looking.  The same problem is here as the blocky figures.  Its just boring to look at.  Yep, there's a leg.  Yep, there's the same leg on the other side.... Yep...  Try to vary things up, put one leg at an angle, push an eye off into perspective, tilt things at an angle relative to other things or make an ear flop, make one smaller or more hidden.  

   d. Keep in mind, the mind follows lines.  

If the line for the hair coming down continues on through the face, the viewer has trouble separating them and they start to look like the same object.  Try to offset lines from one to the other.  Or not.  Just be aware of what this does.  


  e. Never be afraid to ask for advice.

If you get frustrated.  If something looks off and you can't tell why.  For any reason.  This is the easiest way to never make the same mistake again.  


  f. If you know it looks off anatomically, the audience knows it looks off.

This is, unfortunately, always true. For help with this see [identifying compositional awkwardness](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/rb7wf/)




**2. On anatomy:**

   a.  **Use References**

This is The Best Way to Learn.  Copy from a screenshot (don't call the work yours of course).  You can't expect yourself to know how it looks without having drawn how it looks.  


   b. Pony legs are rarely if ever straight and never straight up and down this misconception comes from 1.a.

   c. Pony ears attach towards the back of the head, so when looking at the front from underneath or in a 3/4 view the head is more forward.

 
**3. Thinking like an artist**


   a. Art is **not** Precious.  

This is especially true when making art.  You're obviously already capable of drawing that thing you just drew, so you can erase it to fix its position/perspective/angle/proportion/everything about it.  and you'll be able to draw it faster and better and have learned something from the experience.  Drawing today isn't about making an awesome final product today, its about learning how to make an awesome final product tomorrow.  Tomorrow never comes but if you happen to accidentally make a great one today, great!


   b. Art is fear.   

There is an excellent book [shown here](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Fear-Observations-Rewards-Artmaking/dp/0961454733) called Art &amp; Fear.  For those who are frustrated with art or find themselves bogged down or intimidated by art, or just want to understand what the process is, I recommend this book.  Its short and unnervingly accurate about the way you think when making stuff.  


  c. Forcing yourself to make art in a vacuum, devoid of all contact, inspiration, references and creative exercises is really really bad.  

I can not be redundant enough about this.  


   d. Set long term goals.  

This is for those serious about learning, but is still good to keep in mind for everyone.  It is inevitable to be frustrated or put off doing art.  In order to avoid this set an attainable goal in the far future.  'Get better at coloring by June' or 'be able to draw the mane 6 from memory by October'.  Set a bunch of mini steps in between now and the far off.  Work for an hour a day.  Just an hour.  You'll be surprised at how quickly time jumps ahead when you're not looking.  


**4. Exercises you can do.**

a. [How to measure and compare](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/prx47/rabbis_guide_to_the_perplexed_or_how_to_measure/)(by dispatchrabbi) To get angles, proportions and scale right from a reference use a pencil to compare angles between a reference picture and your piece. Hold the pencil up to the reference to get the angle, then back to your work.  If you do this while working, you'll notice that it becomes a lot easier to correct mistakes that 'just don't look quite right.'  This takes a lot of the guesswork out and makes proportions and angles much easier.  

Do this everywhere.  The angle from the ear tip to the rump.  From eye to muzzle.  From front to back leg.  Between any two arbitrary points or to get the angle and/or placement of a limb or eye or tail.  Absolutely positively everywhere.  And then erase.  Mark, erase, correct and repeat.    Don't get bogged down by working too long in one area.  Get an almost right foundation and move on.  Corrections and refinement come with the process.

There has been some confusion on this, so let me expand.  When I say angle I don't mean relative to horizontal.  Draw your line.  Hold the pencil up parallel to that same line, invisible or not, that you are measuring on your reference.  Bring the pencil over to your piece without changing its angle.  Compare what the pencil is to what you have.  Correct with said pencil.  Repeat.

b. [How to gesture, a process guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/o6iw6/making_art_a_process_guide_todays_method/).  This is another reddit guide that goes into the details of getting proportion and scale correct while giving advice on drawing quickly.  Fast fast fast.  

c. [Shading, everything shading](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/of8jr/shading_everything_shading/).  Actually just the beginning of shading.  But its a nice exercise to follow and learn from.  [This guide here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/p092d/shadows_how_to_make_something_look_like_it_is_in/) goes a little more in depth on what shadows really are and how to work them into art.  [Where to shade](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/pw1hq/where_to_shade_breaking_things_into_their/) goes over breaking down the pony into simpler shapes and what shadows within shadows really are.  

d.  [How to critique and how to take critique](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/p93po/how_to_critique_for_critics_and_artists_alike/).  Artists and critiquers should take a look at this.  It doesn't only have etiquitte, but actual advice on how to help others improve.  Common problems in critique?  [This guide here goes over that](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/r83fb/)

e. [The basics.  A guide on pony anatomy and undersketching](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/pxmj9/the_basics_pony_anatomy_and_undersketching/).  Exactly what it says.  It is a good place for those who really want to capture what an MLP pony looks like.  

f. [Composition.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/qd2uq/composition_how_does_your_drawing_feel_to_look_at/)  This guide is a compacted version of 2d design.  Really good for inspiration.  

Feel free to post questions, pieces for critique, and anything that crosses your mind in this post.

**This guide is meant to be advice only.  These are things to be aware of, not to follow like strict rules of adherence.**  Ignore all the words you like, but if you come to me, this is the advice I give.

Last things last, **fellow critics** help me to write this guide! It is not (and should never be) done.  If you have links or ideas submit them here or PM me and I shall append the guide.

**A critic's compendium. Solving certain problems.  I need your solutions!**

[](/twibeam ""Meetups!"") To be frank we need a lot more guides.  I've got more in the woodworks, but I need 2 things and there's a bonus:

1.  Which guides do you want or would you use or do you think the sub needs more?  This decides which are written first.  Also what more guides can you think of?  What is left out and needs to be covered.

2. I don't have infinity to spend on the sub anymore... sadness, but true. This means that in this post here I need your suggestions for what should be covered in the listed guides.

* **Bonus:**  On the plus side and counter-intuitively I will have more time for meetups which I would like to schedule for some time in the coming 2 months.  This post is also for that.  List your city!  Me?  Denver, CO, but have pencil, time, and funds, will travel.  We can get together, draw art, do some more involved in person helping and go out for food.  Because food.  

Guides yet to come:

* Portraying Concept in Art. Examples: Forlorn lover. Hatred.

* Twilight's Creative Checklist.  Alternate title: **Being free in art.  Anatomy, Seeking shapes and Solving unique problems.**  I may get this one done in the next couple days, but some initial gut reactions as to what should be in it would be nice.  

* More shading. [I've got this comment set](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/q3k7b/bi8_second_verse_ready_to_be_ripped_to_shreds/c3ugtx8) that I need to turn into a guide.  

* Utilizing references.  There's a lot that goes in here.  Help me help you.  

* Identifying Compositional Awkwardness:  Shakyness.  Tension.  Consistency of style.  Consistency of perspective.  Consistency of anatomy v. show/reality.  All anatomy points there and connected correctly.  This one is really about tips and tricks and defining certain things to help you see better.  There is a lot more to it.  

This sub is a community and while it is still being put together I am posting this so that we may come together and help eachother, rather than have it be any sort of dictatorship.  While I may know more than many in terms of art, we all know something and **all** of us have questions.  We can all add to the pile of awesome knowledge.

Welcome to the lesson post number one! (You should probably use [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) for this. Lots of picture links in this one.)

These lesson posts are meant to teach you guys the fundamentals of art. Note that whether you’re already experienced or just starting out, the fundamentals never lose their importance. We’ll have a couple of activities down below, so keep your pencil or tablet handy. 

*The ☨ labels are footnotes for your further reading. I've not many words to put in this post so everything is in the comments.*

*I’ll be here to try to answer as many questions you guys have, so leave a comment if you feel confused or unsure.*

---
**The Undersketch**

When starting art, we usually begin with an under-sketch. It is an essential part of the planning stage of your art piece. This is where you put down lots and lots of lines and try things. You should erase freely and indiscriminately. [Look at this nice sketch by stupjam](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8gskeGZ0g1ra1vfao3_1280.png) Its not immensely detailed, but the magic of a sketch is that its a fantastic way to quickly test things out before you commit to any single idea. At this stage, you can afford to change things at a moments notice, so - 

Use this to your advantage! As a beginner, you might think that your sketch lines are permanent. Once a line is laid down, you shouldn’t change it. Nope. That’s stinkin thinkin. Like the tides and the seasons, *no line is permanent, and you should not hesitate to change things if they look wrong*. [☨^1](http://i.imgur.com/3Lsq4.jpg)

**Swooshy Lines**

[](/c28 ""That isn't even a word!"") In its essence, sketches are flowy, loose things. How you make them flow is by letting your *lines* flow as well. Use *quick, long swooshy* strokes rather than short scratchy ones. I feel this a very important part of sketching. 

[Loose swooshy lines by TexDraws](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyh4dkXmLm1qfj55yo1_1280.png). 

Lots of beginners wrongly use short lines for sketching, and its a bad habit to keep. Whether your strokes are quick and decisive, or swishy and flowy, or short and timid, it will reflect in your work. 

[Linetype Examples](http://i.imgur.com/l8o6I.jpg)

Also, use BIG strokes! Don’t sketch a teeny pony like the doodles people leave on the top of their exam papers. You’ve got an entire sheet of paper to doodle on. GO BIG.

---
**ACTIVITY TIME**

Nuff talk. Lets have a short break here and practice how to actually make swooshy, flowy stuff. Alrighty. Grab a pencil or your tablet, and lets practice drawing shapes. 

Now, I want you to draw BIG circles. Make as many as you can, and as big as you can (don’t just draw one big one and call it a day). Vary their size. Overlap them. Neatness is not important. The idea here is to get you used to the idea of *flow*.

If you’ve got a sketchbook or a nice piece of A4 paper, fill dat page up. For digital users open up a file and make a big canvas (around 3000x1500 pixels will do), and have it fill your entire screen. Fill it up.

What you’ll want to do is use your *shoulder* to draw those circles. Sound scary? It’s really not. Think of it as a [‘wax on, wax off’ motion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PycZtfns_U#t=01m37s/). What do you mean you’ve never seen Karate Kid? Get to drawing, you. 

You should end up with something like this: [Link](http://i.imgur.com/UAWAu.jpg/).

Remember, breathe deep, breathe out. Wax on, wax off.

*Post the finished sheet in the comments so I know you’re not cheating.*

---

Had fun? Carrying on -

**General to Specific**

With sketches, we want to get the general impression of what the final piece will look like. So, it is good procedure to go from *big general lines* to *specific, precise lines*. With general lines, you should be thinking ‘This leg *kinda* goes here, but i’ll be able to change this if it looks weird. This hair *roughly* should flow this way.’ 

The idea behind this is to get your idea down on paper quick. People tend to be afraid of a blank canvas. Its so full of potential, but full of potential failure as well, and that is understandably intimidating. When you make marks on that white space, it’s a lot less intimidating. You get a better idea of what the final piece will be as you put down more lines. This takes a lot of the fear out of starting to draw. [General lines example](http://i.imgur.com/rmJzI.jpg) [☨^2](http://i.imgur.com/i8Rss.jpg)

When you’ve got the general lines down you can move on to more specific lines. ‘This leg should be right here. This mess of lines is an ear.’ [Specific lines example](http://i.imgur.com/FiNSS.jpg) *Keep in mind that this is still not your finished product.* If something looks wrong, keep refining things! [Even more specific by Cooley](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/222/5/f/ponyponypony_cooley_by_cooley-d5annw9.jpg)

**Messiness.**

Be messy! How messy you’ll want to be is up to you, though. Don’t be shy. Sketches are *meant* to be imperfect things. No one will judge you. If you’re judging yourself, stop it, you. Remember that the idea is merely your idea fleshed out on paper, and not your final piece. Look at how messy [Lauren (Faust)’s sketches were](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/268/9/4/big_baddie_by_fyre_flye-d4axlhy.jpg).

[☨^3](http://i.imgur.com/dAhTQ.jpg)

**But hey, some people don't even use undersketches!**

Ah, but we do sometimes see artists pull nice clean lines out of nowhere without no under-sketch in sight. Somehow 5 minutes later they have a pony. What’s up with that? Why do I need one then? 

The problem with this is that these lines don’t come magically to them. They are able to draw these because they’ve done them a thousand times before. Going straight to clean linework without an under-sketch *and* no prior experience is bad plan. If things look out of place, you will have to draw that line again and again, repeating ad infinitum until you get it right. It’s not the greatest of workflows. Not good for sanity either, nope.

While we’re on the topic of experience, i’d like to bring up the fact that even experienced artists make under-sketches. I’m absolutely not making this ‘under-sketch’ thing up! Let’s take a break from the text-wall and take a look at how our friendly neighbourhood Egophilliac sketches. 

---
**Video:**

 [Egophiliac sketch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5NS_SAq_HM&amp;feature=plcp)

Notice how she uses those ginormous loose lines to plan out her picture, before going into specific precise ones. Note her willingness to change things quickly as she sees fit. Something looks wrong? Erase it. Redraw it. Move things. No big deal.

If you want to see more sketch videos, links are in the supporting comment.

**TLDR; The essence of sketching**

- The sketch is not your final product. Nothing is permanent. Make mistakes. Change. Adapt.

- The sketch is a quick way to get your idea down on paper. Big, general shapes. Refine later!

- Allow yourself to be messy.

- Long swooshy lines. With short scratchy lines your picture loses flow.


**Pony sketching**

‘Okay I get it’, you say, ‘bring on the ponies’, you say.

I’d go deeper into this sketching ponies topic, but i’m sure its been covered extensively by many more experienced brony artists before me, so I will be brief. For more detailed guides, look at the footnote comment.☨^Anatomy

Shapes are what ponies are made of.  

[](/a12 ""Not marshmallows?!"")

[](/ajhappy ""Nope. Common mistake."") 

The basis of any pony is [three circles](http://i.imgur.com/KBPGU.jpg). Where your ears, legs, hair, tail, and eyes will be positioned will be based off of these circles. The magic of these circles is that you can move them around along with your legs, and you will have different poses. Witchcraft, really.

Along with these circles, it’s important to understand the underlying skeleton in ponies. They are what determine how the joints move and at what points they move. I know that the show breaks these bone rules a LOT, but to keep them looking from sloppy jelly, bones are important.

*Even as I say this, it is important that you do not rely too much on these circles for poses. Being flexible is a good skill to have when arting, and guiding yourself along circles and shapes is quite the opposite of flexible. Its good to start off with, but move on after you’ve got a good grasp of pony anatomy.*

---
**ACTIVITY TIME**

I’d like you to sketch out a pony. Use guide circles, or if you’re confident enough, don’t. Its up to you. 

Now, i’d like to say that there is no one right way to sketch. People have different sketching styles, and that’s *perfectly fine*. Look at how [stupjam](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8gskeGZ0g1ra1vfao2_1280.png) sketches look like and compare them to [Sunshine’s discord sketches](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8d53ecRYk1r35uet.jpg). The two are in different stages of completion, however the difference is that Stup uses primarily long flowy lines while sunshine uses quick, bold strokes.

Hence, my only conditions for the sketches are that you: Use swooshy lines. Are willing to change things up, and adapt as necessary. Go from general lines to specific ones. Allow yourself  to be messy. 

What I *don’t* want you to do is make your sketch overtly clean. Refinement comes later. If its messy, leave it messy. Cleanliness is not what I intend to teach at this present time. When you’re done, post your stuff down below in the comments. Don’t worry if it looks good or not. We’re all here to learn, so it really doesn’t matter who’s better or worse.

1374967934.0,46,self.MLPdrawingschool,1j6rid,Twilight says: STUDY.,viwrastupr,47,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/1j6rid/twilight_says_study/,"Recently a user asked for assistance developing both a style and giving form and shape to their characters. It led me to making a long response that I felt would be good in guide form, so without further ado I present:

----------

**Twilight says: STUDY**

-----------

[](/sp)[](/twipride ""Study!"")[](/sp)Form and styles are good areas to focus on, however the sheer volume of things to do at this point can be intimidating. But don't worry, it's a one step at a time day by day thing like all art. [](/rarityprimp ""Step by step, drawing it together."")

Everything comes down to doing studies. The different types of studies help you with different aspects of art. A 'study' means finding reference(s) that exemplifies well what you're trying to work on, then you make a **copy**, a **Changed version** and a **Work of your own** based upon the reference(s). [](/twistare ""So much study..."")

Studies that bring more form and shape to the characters:

* **Volume studies.** Volumes mean using cubes, cylinders and spheres to create your ponies rather than flat shapes like circles and rectangles. [This pic illustrates it fairly well.](http://i.imgur.com/BEspE.jpg)

* **Anatomy studies**. Not just of show ponies, but of real horses, joints, muscle structure, how things attach. [Stuff like this](http://cutiehorn.tumblr.com/post/39217148873/horse-anatomy-post). 

* **Action lines.** Action lines help your characters feel more dynamic, alive and are a stepping stone into compositional setup. [This is a good disney based guide on action lines](http://floobynooby.blogspot.com/2011/01/lines-of-action-mickeys-christmas-carol.html). 

* **Expressions.** [This is the best guide ever for expressions](http://tracyjb.deviantart.com/art/Lackadaisy-Expressions-193978013)

---------------

Studies that help you to flush out a personal style: 

* **Other artists.** Find artists that you like (and maybe some you don't) and do studies of their work. [](/ppseesyou ""Claiming a copy study as your own work is punishable by death."")[](/twistare ""Death? But... that's..."")[](/pinkamina ""Forever!"") Now you may be thinking 'but I want my *own* style'. Well, what becomes your style is based upon all the things you know, and you don't really know anything till you do it. Art is hands on like that. I could describe horse legs till I'm blue in the face, but until you've drawn some you'll have little clue how to draw them. What is 'style' is the combination of all the stuff you've studied in the past. Doing some studies of other artists helps you to build up an epic **library of knowledge** to draw from.

'Other artists' is big. It means: pony artists, **real life**, renaissance artists, real life, art movements, impressionist artists, concept artists, real life, that one guy who you like the hairstyle of his anime characters and you'd like to bring it to ponies and anything else that comes to mind. It also means you can break things down and just study the composition of this guy, the linework of another and the markmaking of a third. 'Study' doesn't mean to perfectly articulate everything. It's a quick thing. Which leads me to my next point...

* **Sketching studies** All too often us artists obsess over making every composition perfect, finished and pristine down to every last bit. While this is great for teaching patience and some process stuff, it doesn't lend itself well to making large quantities of art. One six hour piece is a grueling effort of cleaning up lines and putting everything together just so. You're drained of energy and it's hard to get back into art. So, to help everything along, each of these studies can be quick, messy and incomplete. [Like this](http://sta.sh/0sim5fzk66t). Doing sketches lets you learn the above bullets quickly and without all the fuss. [](/ppreference ""sketchy, sketch a sketch."")

Unlike studying math or history or pretty much anything else, art studies are largely automatic exercises, once you get used to not overthinking things. Half an hour zooms by and all of a sudden you're smarter. [](/derp ""Make mistakes, don't make it perfect and work for general ideas, not specific one time only solutions."")

---------------

All studies are based upon the same principle. **Art isn't made in a vacuum**. No one makes art devoid of context, knowledge and environment. Take advantage of those resources and **study**.

Now, you may be looking at some of these and think to yourself ""I've done this before"" and get aggravated at the prospect of doing it again. The truth of the matter is that a study is never complete. There's no end of the book or last episode to studying anatomy or color or texture or any aspect of art. People can and have dedicated their whole lives to one aspect. You can always get better and studies are always helpful. Plus once you get into the swing of things they're actually quite relaxing, like an instruction booklet for what you're making.

I haven't posted very much here, but it's not because of anyone here; I just don't draw many ponies. But what I have posted has been improved by your suggestions and with your help. So, I wanted to say thank you again, for being willing to use your time to help not only me, but all the artists here.

The other thing I wanted to say thank you for is being an inspiring force. Art was getting stagnant for me, and I hadn't done anything serious for quite a long time. But after coming here, seeing people's improvement, reading the guides, studying other artists, trying new things, and doing various challenges, art has once again become an interesting, vital, and enjoyable thing for me to do.

1330620130.0,42,self.MLPdrawingschool,qd2uq,Composition.  How does your drawing feel to look at?  And why?  ,viwrastupr,47,5,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/qd2uq/composition_how_does_your_drawing_feel_to_look_at/,"[](/twistudy ""I am Twilight Sparkle and I'm here to help."")Hello again my little artists, Its time for another edition of viwrastupr's giant text wall. Hopefully Twilight and the examples make this easier on all of you.  This guide has three parts.  

1. Planning stuff

2. Elements of placement

3. Methods to make

[](/twismug ""Art is a lie that tells the truth."") 
There are many different ways to set up a composition and planning can mean the difference between something being anatomically accurate or being interesting to look at. **The purpose of this guide is to teach you to plan and play with composition and how**  There's a whole bunch here, but it is interesting stuff to consider.  And it gets those creative energies going and gets you thinking about art in a whole new way.    

-------------

**Part 1:** A lot of the planning stuff

* Variety How many different elements do you want?  How different should they be?  Adding variety to a piece gives different kinds of attention to different parts. [Notice how each of the limbs on this Twilight are going a different direction and her body is facing a different direction than her head](http://imgur.com/TXR0z).  Variety creates interest.  This is not only true of positioning, but also of texture, value, mark making... a lot of stuff

* Conformity Adding conformity adds stability, repetition, it lets us compare more intricate details.  This is usually not an issue for newer artists as our brains default at horizontal and vertical... [](/twiquery ""Horizontal and vertical lines have their place, but for newer artists it is best to play with diagonals and actions, try to get things interesting."")otherwise known as the most boring things in art.  To be avoided in the beginning, to be used only with intention.  [This shows very well how a vertical line can be used for stability and emotion](http://imgur.com/LNk2Z).  

* Balance[](/twisquint ""What?"") Is there as much on the left as there is on the right?  No? (good) Then why?  What is it doing?  Something to ask yourself during the creation process.  Colors, value, texture, busyness of lines, **placement**.  All these things are a factor of balance. A [good contrast of two values on two separate sides](http://imgur.com/Kd7NC) is a neat balance, but sometimes you don't want it even.

* Emphasis Defined by balance. Where do you want the viewer's eye to look?  Is there contrast there? Is there an eye? Is it busy?  Is there a different color?  Where do the lines point? Then how do we know to look there?  [What is the first thing you notice with this piece](http://imgur.com/u6dvS)?

* Contrast Tells us where things are different.  You may say that 'duh things are different because they're in another spot'. Well, our eyes don't know that. A big problem early artists have is either being dependent on outlines or blurring everything together to make mud.  This is especially true of shadows.  We need to know that the shadow is different from the body.  That the background is different from the foreground.  That the leg is different from the body. Contrast creates space and depth. [It is the contrast of the different shades and values and colors on this Dash that gives her the 3dish feel](http://imgur.com/pw3IB)

* Rhythm Repeated elements, these can be anything from trees in a forest to characters.  [Characters being here](http://imgur.com/mcSUu).  Rythm creates a sense of unity and pulls a piece together, defining what it is about or where it is or other unifying stuffs.

* Repetition What's the difference between repetition and rythm? [A pattern is much more alike than a rythm](http://imgur.com/EN5j2)

* Scale How big the pony is makes it more or less important to the composition.  [Notice how the background characters here are smaller than Dash](http://imgur.com/XRdAh)

* Figure/Ground relationship. Separating your figure from the background is ludicrously important.  It tells us what is figure and what is not, it also tells us what is important and gives us a sense of space.  A lot of people use outlines for this purpose, but there are ways to do it with shape, value and color.  [This piece is separation by value](http://imgur.com/lnt0f)

* Direction -gaze, gesture, prominent lines of contrast.  Our eyes follow gaze and gestures.  It is implied line. [This piece does both, pointing out the beauty of the branches above](http://imgur.com/4507R)

* Movement/Action Diagonal lines help with these a lot, but it is figural.  What your character is doing creates intrigue.  [Would this be exciting without any movement?](http://imgur.com/2GJRz) 

* Faces and emotions [](/twibeam ""Emotion me!"")Not technically a part of 2d design.  But  important.  Our eyes identify faces fist and start there. [Emotions make or break how we view the character](http://imgur.com/zAG9j).  Also emotions aren't be dependent on the face alone. [Value and texture also play an important role](http://imgur.com/wZu7q).

* Concept.  -Again, not 2d design, but still really important.  [This piece overflows with concept ](http://imgur.com/0mb9M).  Mystery, implied stuffs.  Things that give an attachment to a piece that isn't emotion.  [This is a piece that does a good job of combining both emotion and concept without face](http://imgur.com/ZfKeZ).  

-----------

**Part 2:** Elements of placement

* Continuance Intended or unintended.  Orientation/Implied Lines. When you have a line that flows directly into another line or a place of contrast that does the same, or a series of objects in a row, our eyes follow this line.  [The pillar here is placed in the same plane as the eye because we follow it down into the composition, resting on the eye easily](http://imgur.com/X607r)

* Tension When two objects are very close or an object is very close to the edge it creates tension.  Usually this is something to be wary of, creating it unnecessarily [but when done on purpose can be quite neat.  Here the pony being close to the edge pushes us back into the composition](http://imgur.com/WwmS9).

* Looseness/vastness  How much space are you allowing for the figure? [This shows very well the impact of space](http://imgur.com/k6Tsl)

* Crowdedness  Can add interest, but also creates confusion. [Collages are an excellent example of crowdedness](http://imgur.com/lPFmV)

* Asymmetry/Symmetry.  Asymmetry provides interest.  Symmetry provides order.  Both are good at times, but be wary of order.  [](/twipride ""If you don't know that symmetry is... you are making me sad."")

* The rule of thirds -It is a way that artists divide the composition into three equal parts.  Placing important points like the horizon line, the figure, eyes creates more interest for the brain.  [Wikipedia is better at explaining this than I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds).  Anything about composition that applies to photography applies to art

* Central composition. [This Derpy provides a beautiful example](http://imgur.com/QlUak).  This doesn't really qualify for its own bullet but I love Derpy and this is an excellent composition

-----------

**Part 3**  Methods to make

[](/twistare ""What do you mean there's more?"")

* Lines Known as paths, curves. Everybody knows about lines.  We all think that lines are all you make art with. At first. [This is line.](http://imgur.com/hSwAh)

* Shapes! An area. This is what I'm referring to when I say shadow shapes.  Shapes are their own volume and learning to create with shapes pushes you into learning to think in 3 dimensions. [This Rainbow is made with shapes and not a line brush. Active](http://imgur.com/HqyUe)

* Value light and dark.  How bright do you want your composition to be?  How dark?  At first people make things even, trying to get *order*. Ordered is a dirty word in art. [Look at this Spitfire and tell me it isn't beautiful in its brightness](http://imgur.com/hl6mm) and [tell me the same of this moment and darks](http://imgur.com/A0pSr).  Plan and play

[](/twicrazy ""Colors. I thought I was almost done and there's a guide within a guide. Jerk"")* Colors basic color theory [as seen in this awesome guide](http://purplekecleon.deviantart.com/gallery/?q=color#/d31xj5t).  Color is a class of its own. [Take this megasweet piece for example](http://imgur.com/vHZGZ). Color makes it pop

* Space Height, width and the illusion of depth. Putting two or more similar objects in a piece gives you ability to play with depth [such as with this piece](http://imgur.com/pRbiH).  Notice how Sorin is bigger and thus seems closer. A large number of horizontalish divisions also helps give an illusion of depth [such as in this piece](http://imgur.com/Ix23D).  There is also perspective but that's a different lecture

* Texture. Texture is very active and draws the eye in to visit all the parts of the piece.  It is a good cookie (explained later).  [This piece would be different if it weren't for the textured background](http://imgur.com/tliX0).

* Text.  -[This text is awesome](http://imgur.com/Rn493), now imagine it without text.  It has no flair. Text adds mood and context.  You can play around with specific fonts and give flourish

* Cookies. These are a reward to your audience for looking.  It can be anything from a rich texture to an easter egg. You don't notice this on first glance, but the more you look the more you enjoy. [](/cookie ""Everypony wants a cookie.  Or a muffin."") These make a good art epic.  The texture, the fuzzy background, the wearing of the hat, the holding hooves. [This piece is full of happy cookies](imgur.com/NH9Uj).

As you can see from the various examples, these elements play together and flourish.  Art is infinite and wonderful

1330455081.0,38,self.MLPdrawingschool,qa0lp,MLP Animation Breakdowns - So You Say You Want to Study Movement,Dazhbug,40,2,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/qa0lp/mlp_animation_breakdowns_so_you_say_you_want_to/,"[](/ppreference) Alright, yeh artists! I don't know how many of you pay attention to the main sub, but recently a gbeaudette has started making short videos wherein he takes a close look at animation in the show, using some very basic Flash work:

[Smile Smile Smile breakdown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vhGGy3i6aA&amp;context=C37cb375ADOEgsToPDskLgXEzPreCin1ZdG2n9iC84)

[Applejack Hay Toss breakdown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbCWkXNIP1g&amp;feature=youtu.be)

These videos are an absolute gold mine of awesome information, even if you're not a MASSIVE NERD like me and in love with animation. One of the best takeaways from animation analysis for artists is... drumroll please... MOVEMENT! Remember that Line of Motion picture that viw posts around? Here, let me go find it...

[](/c20 ""I really need to remember to start bookmarking some of these things."")

Well, I couldn't find viw's but [close enough](http://www.drawinghowtodraw.com/stepbystepdrawinglessons/2010/03/how-to-draw-cartoons-in-action-for-comics-and-animation-with-line-of-action/). Brief lesson in animation time: animating is all about moving between exaggerated extremes of motion; this not only makes for very dynamic cinema, but allows the viewer (who is seeing these things happen at 30-60 fps) to more easily follow the motion. If you don't exaggerate enough, the animation becomes vague and confusing. I learned this lesson early on while I was constructing combat cycles in class; when you actually *fight* you don't want to anticipate your motion (otherwise you get clobbered). My first tries at animating were muddy and dull due to my brain insisting that I not include large anticipatory gestures.

[](/a22 ""Derp"")

Anyway, so animation works with exaggerated extreme poses and the movement between them. These exaggerated poses are called ""keys"" or ""key frames"", because they define the look and feel of the shot; they are by design the most interesting parts of the animation to look at. Now, *strangely enough*, we as artists are trying to put together (still) pieces of art that *are also interesting to look at*. Hopefully you see where I'm going with this.

[](/c02 ""See, get it? Because key poses are interesting and we want to make interesting art and..."")

I'm going to use dispatchrabbi as an example here, because he's a) awesome and b) working on a piece that I think really demonstrates the use of both line of motion and exaggerated posing. If you weren't in the stream yesterday, he's working on a shot of Sweetie Bell standing on a stool, reaching waaaaay out for something. The reference is [here](http://www.bmloeffelman.com/pictures/MLP/SwBRef_stretching.jpg) (apologies for the small size). Sweetie Bell not only has a very definite line stating her intent, but it's further reinforced by the exaggerated stretching of her body; she's reeeeeally reaching for whatever it is.

[](/sbstare ""Yes, you should be afraid of me succeeding"")

Anyway, I just wanted to toss these two videos into everyone's collective consciousness, and get people thinking about line of motion and exaggerated, dynamic posing. Something I want to work on more myself, as well.

Its purpose is to make everyone aware of everything sub.  These will be monthly and this first here one will be redundant. [](/flutterwink ""Hi again everypony!"")

**Where we are and where we're going**:

This sub.

We've got a [deviantart group too](http://mlpdrawingschool.deviantart.com/)! [](/fluttershy ""Join the group... that is... if you don't mind."") Which needs some love.

There are quite a few members with tumblr accounts, post yours below!

I would like to expand to youtube as soon as I get settled... in late August.  

**What happens here**:

We critique pony art!  To help all the peoples get better at art, from beginner to seasoned professional all persons welcome who wish to improve.  

The sub answers questions!  Not sure where to go from here?  How to fix something?  How to do something?  Have any question?  Make a self post and we'll do our best to answer.

We hang out! June 23rd &amp; 24th is official mlpdrawingschool hangout weekend.  The official official meetup is in Chicago, but if you have fellow pony artists near you, find them too!  Also, there are lounge posts.  **The lounge posts are largely unregulated** in that they don't have to be about pony art and anyone can post one.  However, discussion questions are just about mandatory to get the conversations started.


**Who does what**:

This sub is a community.  By no means do the mods have any real authority or responsibilities more than just enforcement.  

Everypony submits and everypony critiques.  This means that if you see something off in someone's post, comment about it. [](/forgotshy ""I thought I forgot to do something today... critique!"") Critiques don't have to be big professional things, but give what you can.  

**The purpose of this post**:

Voice your concerns.

Voice your ideas.  What could be improved here?  What do we need?  Something I'd like to mention is that there were a few less welcomes to the new peoples as a whole while I was gone and this made me sad... just because it's a critique doesn't mean it's not fun.  

Voice your questions. [](/loveme ""You... are going to... SPEAK UP!"")[](/fluttershh ""...please."")

I have decided that instead of having a normal livestream day that I want to challenge myself to a ridiculous level all day Sunday.

So I am going to draw 100 ponies.  Eight minutes maximum time per pony to contemplate, create, save, and move on.

What I need from you:  **References.**  I know there are more than 100 ponies in the show, but I am bound to run out of ideas quickly.

I'd also like some conversation.  Questions on art are welcome and critique can happen, though I'll be working through it.  Stop in, say hello.

This is a challenge, but also a demonstration.  I don't know that I can do this.  But I *will*.  Push yourself beyond yourself

Hello, welcome to my tutorial for making stencil art. I will be going through the steps that I use to take an image, generally a vector from the show, and turning it into a final piece of stencil art. This part of the tutorial will focus on materials and prepping your first project.

First off, you want to make sure you have all the materials you will need to start your project. It isn't any fun to get ready for a step only to find out you forgot some crucial material, making you rush out to find it. Here is just a basic list of stuff you will need, with a bit about each one.

* Spray Paint: The most obvious part of spray paint art is the paint. There are many kinds available. Finding the colors you want can be tough depending on what you have available in your area. Home Depot and WalMart carry a good stock of paint colors for around three to six dollars a can. Art stores in your area may have a much wider selection of colors in higher end graffiti paints, but those can run up to ten dollars a can. My art stores stock Montana Gold Paint, which is awesome paint, but it falls into the $10 a can category.

* Canvas: I am going to assume you want to paint on something to hang up, not go spray a wall somewhere. I buy canvas at my local art shop. The offer economy canvases two to a package. Look for sales and coupons to cut down the cost.

* Stencil Material: There are a ton of options here. Regular computer paper can work fine, but the stencils will not last long after repeated paintings. Poster board, freezer paper, transparency film, the list can go on. Print onto the material if you can, or tape the printer paper onto the second material and cut it out from there. I like to use [National Geographic Adventure Paper](http://www.amazon.com/National-Geographic-Adventure-Paper/dp/B00005OMZ9/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311315295&amp;sr=8-1). It holds up well to multiple paintings, cuts really well, and can be taped and removed without tearing. However, it is expensive.

* Blade: I use a pretty standard Xacto blade, except it is pink and cushioned for easy holding. Buy some extra blades for your knife. A sharp knife will make cutting that much easier on you. Get a good backing material to cut your stencils on. I use a high density card stock that some printer manuals came in to protect my glass desk.

* Masking Material: The stencil can only cover so much of your canvas. I use Scotch blue painters tape and regular weight printer paper for most of my other masking to keep the paint from going where I don't want it. I sometimes use some adhesive to hold down tiny details that want to move around. I either use acid free rubber cement or 3M Super77 adhesive spray. For both just a tiny bit will go a long way in making your paintings look nice.

* Painting area: Good ventilation is primary here. I paint in my garage with the door open. Cover the ground so you don't get paint everywhere. Here are some pics of my painting area. Don't be like me, keep it clean: [Garage 1](http://i.imgur.com/EooUZ.jpg) [Garage 2](http://i.imgur.com/UMqdR.jpg). The garage has been cleaned up. I didn't notice how bad it had gotten while I was working.

* Other Stuff: Many times you will need to hold a stencil with your free hand to get clean edge lines. For this just use rubber gloves, lots of them. Change them all the time to keep everything clean. I don't use a filter mask, but I guess it wouldn't be a bad idea.

That about covers it for materials. Choosing the image you want to make can be one of the harder parts. I got to cheat for this since I asked for suggestions from Mittens2248 on what he wanted to see get made. We decided on [this image of Fluttershy](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/108/3/8/fluttershy_vector_by_issyrael-d3ec9yo.png).
I liked this one since it was funny, and I had all the paint colors on hand. 

Prepping for making the stencils:
I decided to capture my screen as I worked in Photoshop prepping the image and talking about layers and composition. So here is your first of two opportunities to watch me talk to myself for a few minutes. [Watch it here!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25Z4SX8xECQ)


The next tutorial about cutting the stencils will be out in a few days, and should not be nearly as verbose. Questions and feedback are greatly appreciated.

Thanks to Mittens2248 for suggesting I do the tutorial and thebestwes for letting me co-opt his drawing school subreddit.

[](/twiquery)**Question One: ""Wait, I'm not a lurker, right?""**

Oh look, you've subscribed! You're one of us now, right? Part of the community, yes? No. Not to sound like I'm raising a barrier between lurkers and submitters but joining up merely adds a 'one' to the number of subscribers. We can't see your name or account page or anything, we don't even know if *you've* subscribed because there isn't a list of subscribers. You're merely 'following' the subreddit anonymously. Harsh, right? Probably. But don't get disheartened by my assholy-ness my faceless friend - I, like other member of the sub, would be extremely happy if you announce yourself with a drawing, sketch, doodle, whatever. You're subscribed to a pony sub - love and tolerance come with the package, and an art sub at that - Learning and helping each other is what we do. No one here is a teacher, everyone is a learner and a helper. Even you, hopefully, soon...
___
[](/twipride)**Question Two for lurkers: What, you think we'll just take your nice little pony drawing you've poured your heart and soul into and utterly smash it to pieces?**

`

[](/twicrazy)**Answer:** ... May I cordially introduce - The Critique Hammer. I just know you two will get along swimmingly - You'll be seeing a lot of each other.

There is a number of people here who submit awesome pieces of art that took days, some that show hour-long sketches, others with 5-minute doodles from a class notebook - all teaming with creativity and talent at one stage or another.

Okay, they're in the New Que. What happens with these pieces? 

They are critiqued; their simpler mistakes (relevant to the piece) and more personal flaws (their traits as an artist) are brought forth like a seemingly harsh, stark light. Don't worry, you want this. It may seem like a slap to the face but trust me, being told your flaws outright is immeasurably more productive and beneficial to you than being told you did well. Of course we're not against saying how good you are but let me take a useful sentence from the sidebar; **""Praise is good, but only in moderation.""**

[](/c11) Let me explain: You know about your better traits. That's why their your better traits, you understand them. What you don't understand  - your flaws - are what the critics tell you about so that you do know about them and they can be learnt from, turned into positive traits and reflect back in future pieces. Find the critics daunting? [](/a23) Don't worry - if you follow their advice, soon you'll become so good that they can't pick out anything wrong with it! How good does that sound! (Though Viw will probably STILL be able to point SOME kind of error out... )
___
This is all from my head and from watching the activity on the sub over the last few weeks, but I have compiled some stats - seems vaguely accurate to me but nothing concrete;

* 1300+ subscribed

* ~200 voters (highest post has 50 upvotes. Seriously? Only 50 people out of 1300+ have an opinion on something?)

* ~50 rare submitters (posted at least one piece ever).

* ~30 casual submitters (posts every now and then, not super active, at least once a week if that).

* ~20 active submitters (regularly posts content, at least every few days).

* ~15 in streams (Viw's, Living_Dead's and Dispatchrabbi's for example).

That's less than 100 submitters - ever - to more than 1300 subscribers.

That's the same as over 5 to 1.

And that's bad - No, it physically saddens me, that so much talent and creativity, just sitting right there in front of the screen reading this, is - well, doing just that. Sitting in front of the screen, not becoming active. I get that time zones can get in the way of people being in the streams, but if you go into the new que after 24 hours only about 10 new submissions have surfaced. Up to 10 different people out of clear-over 1300.
___
[](/c21)**Question Three for lurkers: Feel discouraged?**

A little extra about critiques - When someone gives you a critique, they are **not telling you what to do.** Remember - no teachers. A critique is a conversation - reply! You are fully encouraged to argue your points and ask questions you may have. Also, critiques aren't between two people - when a critique is posted it is open for all 1300 of us to agree *or indeed disagree* with; It builds a critique into so much more and gives everyone a lot more help with everyone involved.

[](/a23)Hey! Hey hey! See that? The background? Your drawing could be there too, you know! As a congratulations, the highest voted piece of the week gets to spend the next week as the background image! Cool, right? So everyone who merely walks in on our sub will see how awesome you are!

People are starting to have flairs next to their name, and I don't completely know why, maybe some are rewards, some are jokes, perhaps it signifies them as a regular on the sub. Whatever the reason one gets a flair for, I'm feeling that people may see these people and think we're a 'group', making others feel kind of ostracized or distant from the community. Don't feel like that. We're here to help, have fun, chat, play - heck, we even have our own [Lounge!](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/qmqp7/) I'm assuming this is a weekly thing, so just pop in and chat with fellow artists whenever. ~~I'm going to promote Viw's next livestream as well (Sunday 7pm EST (GMT -6:00)).~~ (Over now.)
___

[](/b20) **DO IT! DO IT FILLY!**

[](/b16)A good way to introduce yourself and meet fellow artists here in the sub, along with other new posters, is to do it here! Drop a comment, introduce yourself, maybe post a link to a drawing? It's fine, we won't bombard you with soul-crushing critiques this time round.

[](/a24) Okey dokey lokey, cheesy ending time. I've ~~ranted~~ said all I can.  
Are you going to post, come into the light and introduce yourself? Or sit in the dark corners of the sub, unknown to the rest of us? I for one would rather get to know you all, but [the choice is yours.](http://images1.fanpop.com/images/photos/1900000/Morpheus-Red-or-Blue-Pill-the-matrix-1957140-500-568.jpg)
___
**[edit] From Living_Dead:**

&gt;A little insight to how the flair system works. I upvote every submitted piece of art on this sub (or atleast try). With the power of res I know how many upvotes I have given someone. Generally when you hit 3 you get me off my flank to spend 13 seconds giving you flair. Now for the people who have odd names next to them is either I thought it was funny or was drunk, Either way I happily change it back if they hate it.

[](/a14)I guess there's less need to feel distant because of flairs now, right?

1326967628.0,32,self.MLPdrawingschool,on3bm,6th Bi-Weekly Drawing Challenge,viwrastupr,36,4,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/on3bm/6th_biweekly_drawing_challenge/,"Hello everypony!  This is my first bi-weekly challenge and I'm here to really challenge you.  

I'm posting this at 3am, so upvote for visibility please! (self-post no karma)

Since the sub has been growing so fast, it is soon inevitable that we shall reach 1000 members. This is a wonderful milestone. In the short time I've been here I've seen every artist who posted twice improve. It gives me both pride and humility to help teach among the kindness and talent of this crowd. 

For this next challenge I'd like to both expand our membership and challenge everypony here. So here's my proposal.

Think on a composition you'd like to make, be it a joke an action or just a pony. Plan in your head how you'd like it to look in the end. Really plan on challenging yourself and making this **the best thing** you've done yet. That composition that you've been thinking of doing, but have been to afraid of your own talent to do? *Do it*. I know you can. 

Post progress shots here and ask for help and feedback along the way. If you get stuck, get frustrated, want help, want a place to start, ask and the community as a whole shall oblige. That texture or style another artist does and you really want to do but you don't know how? Ask how and I'll do my best to help. From the painterly coloring style to a heavily textured style, to a clean, block style.  Anything you want to make a goal, now is the time to try it.  You never get there if you don't try.  

It won't be perfect, nothing is ever but aim to make this the best thing you've ever done. Make mistakes. Challenge yourself. Ask Questions. Be proud.

Once you have finished, there is a great reward waiting. 
Submit this awesome work to r/mylittlepony with a title beginning with: ""On behalf of r/MLPdrawingschool"" and then however the heck you want to title it from there is fine. Here's the catch. **Whomsoever's post gets the most comments gets to design the 1000 members background banner for the sub!** (without soliciting and minus your own, though feel free to talk) Why not upvotes? Because I want everypony to participate! Anypony of any talent level of any medium. This isn't about the contest, its about showing r/mylittlepony that we exist and what we do. And that we're awesome.  

Most importantly this challenge is about proving to yourself that you are making progress.  You can push yourself to great heights.  Those amazing artists out there?  Those artists can be you.  

For your inspiration, I've collected a few pics and stars to shoot for.

[The simplicity of this style](http://i.imgur.com/XERrm.jpg) is capable of great depth of emotion.   Pic by kelou4.

[The atmosphere and texture in this piece](http://rizcifra.deviantart.com/art/quot-You-remind-me-of-someone-quot-212495190) is eloquent and fits perfectly with the concept.

[Some rather standard coloring](http://bioniclegahlok.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-Sparkle-FiM-253904407?q=boost%3Apopular%20twilight%20sparkle&amp;qo=47) can be pushed.

[Or you can go a little painterly/cartoon](http://harwicks-art.deviantart.com/art/Know-When-to-Fold-Em-274057023).

[Or you can even go full on paint](http://kp-shadowsquirrel.deviantart.com/art/Applejack-Gala-Portrait-279747288).

[You can go simple](http://bamboodog.deviantart.com/art/Feathering-Twilight-266886552?q=boost%3Apopular%20twilight%20sparkle&amp;qo=304).

[As always, traditional media is welcome](http://carlotta-guidicelli.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-SmarterthanyouSparkle-215193475?q=boost%3Apopular%20twilight%20sparkle&amp;qo=333).

[If you really want a challenge, go for this  use of color line and subtle intricacies](http://i.imgur.com/Y5JdG.jpg) He also did [pinkie pie](http://twilightsparkle.bronibooru.mlponies.com/post/show/12495/pinkamena_diane_pie-pinkie_pie-tsampikos).

More shall be added later as they come to me.

[Movement + show style = awesome](http://equestria-prevails.deviantart.com/art/Luna-280236902).

Yes, you are capable of doing this.  Yes I am going to help you.  Yes, this may take quite a long time.  You can do it, because you are going to make mistakes and you are going to learn and you are going to keep at it.  This is one big leap.  Let's go.

1376167798.0,34,self.MLPdrawingschool,1k3vth,Calling all Sketchers - a Vector Collab!,SilverRainclouds,40,6,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/1k3vth/calling_all_sketchers_a_vector_collab/,"Hello there, artists! I'm here on behalf of /r/MLPvectors! I would like to do a collab with you guys! 

I would like the artists of /r/MLPdrawingschool to draw sketches for the vectorers at /r/MLPvectors to finish in vector!

Here's how it works...

* We're going to use this thread to find partners. Sketch artists respond to this thread directly, with an example or two of their work. Vector artists will chose their partners by responding to their comment, ""I choose you!"". 

* If you think you can handle more than one partner, feel free to repeat the process, but no more than 3 per user, please! (You may do one on each 'side' as well, if you like.)

* Once you have a partner, you may use the comment thread you chose each other in or a PM to negotiate what you would like to do together. You can do just one pony, or a whole bunch, backgrounds, shading, or whatever you feel comfortable with.

* Sketch artists - post your sketch here for a quick critique before sending it off to your partner to finish!

* Vector artists - remember to post your vector to /r/MLPvectors when you're done!

* Tips for sketch artists: Try to keep your sketches clean, and easy to understand. Stick to canon characters, so it's easier for your partner to recognize. No need co color, that's vector artist's job this time!

* Tips for vector artists: Use a [color guide](http://i1.minus.com/ibgWupUf0REKZI.png). The sketch will probably not have thick colored, tapered lines like the finished pony should, so feel free to [look at some references](http://ponyresource.booru.org/index.php) to help you with those.

* There's not really a deadline to finish by, but try to work quickly so you don't leave your partner hangin'! This thread will be open for registration for two weeks.

The purpose of this lesson is not to teach you any specific rules about proportions or whatnot, but to just get you to ease in to art and get in the proper mindset. 

Important points summary:

•Don't sweat the small stuff, work loose and gestural

•Work from biggest to smallest

•Critique yourself, and don't be afraid to admit your flaws

•Practice is the only thing that will make you better

**Assignment**: Draw something simple. Anything (although bonus points for pony-related material). No matter how simple. Do try to spend at least 5-10 minutes on it, though.

1349251693.0,36,self.MLPdrawingschool,10v6m1,This is your community.  Proposals for change.,viwrastupr,41,5,142,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/10v6m1/this_is_your_community_proposals_for_change/,"[We've got an IRC!  Come on in and chat with us!](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-mlpds)

This is a complete restructuring of the sub as we know it.  Please leave your feedback on what you would like, what works for you, what doesn't and any ideas or suggestions of your own.  

There's been some discussion lately for improving the sub as a whole.  This is your community so I want your feedback before implementing any large changes.  What's been proposed:

-------------

**Self post only**

This sub is not about karma.  At all.  They distract from the larger issue of learning.  Also, self posts allow for the artist to begin the discussion of their work which is really helpful as a critic.  It minimizes the need for tags and really helps other artists know where to go to help.  Self posts also give the poster inbox messages when replies are added and linked posts do not.  It's harder to ignore the critics this way.  

-----------------------------

**Replacement of the bi-weeklys**

As they're structured now bi-weeklys are random and quite arbitrary in the lessons they teach.  There's no direction nor does it allow for users of all skill levels to incorporate their own ideas.  As such it has been proposed that weekly exercises take the place of bi-weeklys.  These exercises would be accompanied with guides that tell the artist what they can learn from the exercise as well as several different variations or a general goal to appeal to artists of all skill levels.  

These are not necessary every week.

---------------------------

**Branching out from ""only critique"" expectations**  

Whoever posts gets a critique, yes?  Well.... not exactly.  Improvement comes from many sources.  From study to guides to critique to general information and process thoughts.  For those newer people it's really useful to point out specific flaws.  As we continue though things get a bit more complex.  

Discussion is where real improvement lies.  The issue here remains artists that post and run.  It's no fun for critics and it kills any sense of community.  

------------------------------------

**Welcoming the new**

This is important.  Critique has become dry and stale when the people posting it aren't that at all.  Talking about art and saying hello isn't a job.  Don't expect the world of yourself as a critic and fellow artist.  

I have no idea what can fix this, if anything.  An artist's first critique and first welcome determines largely whether or not they stay and are a part of the community or wander off.  

------------------

**Branching out from reddit**

Not something I'm for, but worth discussion.  But reddit really isn't the best medium for teaching.  A forum or an independent site would be best.  but reddit allows us to be a part of a larger MLP community and integrate people already there.  

Right outside of reddit now we do livestreams, have a deviantart group, a steam group, an active chat room, and should get a youtube channel.  

------------------------------

**Bringing back the fun**

Where did it go?  A large part of this is my fault.  Too many dry critiques and dry posts.  But my real life prohibits fun right now (it's true, I read it in the charter).  [](/lunasad ""I am not okay."")

There was once an excitement to create and use our own emotes.  Now the regular ones are hardly used at all, let alone our own.  Your very own emote, to be used and played with as you wish.  

What I'm wondering here is what do we do?  

-----------------

**Death of the project**

There's been no excitement, participation or discussion for creating this.  It's not supposed to be something I'm dictating or made for a person or persons at all.  Its supposed to be a collaboration between artists.  Collaboration is a wonderful beautiful thing in art.  Dictation is not.  A mini comic or another collaborative idea is going to replace this.  Ideas are welcome.  Something free, open and not so large.  

-----------------------

**New first stop guide**

This is about absolutely necessary.  The sidebar is cluttered and it's unclear where new artists need to go.  A guide needs to be created to help people see where they fit in the sub and if it is for them. 

A better, more descriptive compilation of useful links and the reddit guides is needed as well.  

---------------------------

**Requiring new artists to throw up a tag** 

To show they're at least aware of where they're posting.  All too often new artists post and run, never to be seen again. 

This is one possible solution for crit and run artists.  Thoughts or ideas?  

--------------

**Moving past ponies**

Not every piece of art made is made about or for ponies.  My questions are these:

Is the Thursday pony plus enough?

Are exercises and lessons that have nothing to do with ponies okay?  

What would you like for your non pony art?

--------------

What else could be changed or improved?  What sounds good to you and what sounds icky?

Everything here is a proposal, nothing is set in stone.  What needs be done?  

----------

Thought I should create a progress post!,PorkchopSammie,37,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/18ydju/gauntletnonponyive_been_doing_a_gauntlet_for_a/,"Viw contacted me about a month ago asking if I was interested in doing a gauntlet. I’ve been mostly focused on things non-pony, plus I’m a pretty private person, so I haven’t posted what I’ve been working on for the sub to see. Hopefully you all have RES installed for easy viewing of this boatload of images.

But I thought it would be good for others to see exactly what a gauntlet constitutes.

My initial assignments: ~ 1 hour a day. Work along with PK’s Color Guide, doing speedpaints for each topic.

At least 3 speedpaints a week, focusing on art themes: hatching, linework, colors, textures, etc. So, they each need to have purpose.

Sketch compositions and thumbnails - quick and dirty!

Draw from real life.

My colors are too segregated, and I treat art like it’s precious - afraid to change anything once I have it down on paper.

The first few weeks were really just me getting used to working fast and loose (my first page of thumbnails was probably ~ an hour per thumbnail, which is brutal and stupid). Now I’m working a TON on color theory, temperature, and harmony. In addition I do lots of gesture drawing and (not enough) observational drawing.

Here’s Imgur links to my workload so far, week by week:

**Week 1**:

[study in limited palette and simplicity](http://i.imgur.com/zoMM1BY.jpg).

at this point I started collecting scraps onto one image for easier viewing.[week 2

[thumbs from the animated short “The Reward”](http://i.imgur.com/tULq1uz.jpg). I tried to eyeball the colors, then eyedropper them to see how far off I was.

[pony faces from screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/z9nyjHc.png).

[speedpaint trying to de-segregate my colors](http://i.imgur.com/hOkSs53.jpg). This did end up being ~2, 2 ½ hours, but I just couldn’t help but go back and change things and refine, etc.

[some junky hatching](http://i.imgur.com/z0TIzxb.png). Only including this out of honesty.

**Week 3**:

My mission this week was to steal palettes from other artists (bottom right is a Van Gogh, upper right is from Baglione) This really helped me to understand color. This week’s main focus was understanding color temperature, and finally breaking myself of thinking that anything is a certain color. I’ve also been reading a lot of Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, and letting myself just go nuts when sketching. Scribble around like a madman until a shape pops out.

[1st round of Pokemon color studies](http://i.imgur.com/4IbcYx6.jpg). I picked up my old copy of Pokemon and was inspired by all the different designs and color schemes to work with. Each of these is ~ 15 minutes? The idea was taken from one of Viw’s uploads, where he colored the same sketch several times. I thought it was neat because 1) you don’t have to spend much time on linework, and can really focus on color, and 2) it shows how much of an impact color and light have on the same pose/drawing/scene.

[2nd round of pokeymons](http://i.imgur.com/G8rUHK4.png). I couldn’t get enough, so I did more. 

[120 second figure drawings from thedrawingscript](http://i.imgur.com/n7xlU9M.jpg). Just good practice for eyeballing things, and working fast.

**Week 5**:

I’ll compile all the stuff I worked on and send it to Viw next Tuesday (I try to keep it to once a week so he’s not flooded). But here’s the first image of the week to show where I’m going.

[yet more pakeymons](http://i.imgur.com/jBB5N3Y.jpg). My goal here was to move past analogous color/temperature schemes, and work in more warms and cools together. Not exactly a success, but I did play around with strength and direction of lighting, as well as incorporating more of a sense of background to the image. I’ll keep working on it. Again, unless otherwise noted, I try to keep everything very strictly in a 1 hour time limit for each image. In this case, I think I spend 10-20 minutes per panel.

So, apologies for the wall of text, hopefully this gives you all an idea of what to expect! It’s a big commitment, because you can’t just blow off your studies (I mean, you can, but it means you’re a bad person).

The first stop guide.,viwrastupr,32,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/r84ig/sub_etiquette_the_first_stop_guide/,"[](/pinkiehi ""Welcome welcome welcome!"") Hello, and welcome to the /r/mlpdrawingschool subreddit!  We provide resources and critique for pony artists of all levels.  We do have a few rules, listed in the sidebar and there are a couple of guides that everypony should look at.

1. [DON'T PANIC](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/nxdpy/)! This links to all the guides from shading to composition and goes over some ways to think about art.  

2. [Lesson 1](http://redd.it/xxmkm) sketching techniques.  This goes over how to approach ponies artistically and the general sketching process.  [Dispatchrabbi has also made this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/prx47/) on measuring and comparing.  Great for proportions and anatomy and not having to resolve the same problem for the umpteenth time.  

-------

**General sub etiquette.**

* Read the guidelines in the sidebar. [Also, if you're curious as to what tags mean click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/rhars/).

* [How to critique is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/p93po/) for artists and critics alike.  

* Don't spam the sub.  More than one submission per day is generally frowned upon.  If you've updated a piece that you submitted earlier that is great, reply to your critics and ask them questions.  [](/lunasad ""I really don't want to remove genuine submissions, so please stick to this."")  If you have multiple pieces or are having a drawing day, wait till they're all done and make them an imgur album.  Imgur is RES friendly and a lot of people respond well to that.  

* Redundancy happens.  Your critics will link to the same guide a dozen times.  That's because there's always more to take and a new way to approach your art.  Listen to your critics and trust them.  They may not always know why, but ""what"" is generally true.  

* Respond to your critics.  Critique is a conversation.  Nothing is sadder than a piece with two or three critiques and perhaps a lone comment by the submitter.  We expect you to have questions, a mind and a personality!  This is mlp, not too srs business.  Say thank you, yes sir, huh, whatever comes to mind.  Respond.  

* [The bi-weekly challenges are always open](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/q693h/).  They are here for you to improve, make use of them.  Create a piece, make a new post and we'll critique!  And we could always use more emotes.

* **Please give back to the community.**  If you get critiques, give critiques.  It can be as simple as stating the obvious anatomical errors or as complex as an in depth analysis.  Link to a guide that helped you, talk with the peoples.  We're all human and this is about My Little Pony, getting better at art and and flooding the world with pony art.  Play.  

[](/flutterfear ""So this is the infinityth guide I've made... oh, first stop?"")[](/fluttershy ""Probably should've made this first... sorry."") [](/twismile ""Critics, link to guides!  They go in depth so you don't have to every time."")[](/twiquery ""Anything else that should be in here or that I've forgotten/left out?"")  **EDIT**:  Spread awareness.  Tell others that they can link to guides.  Give out tips, not orders.  Spread the culture of the sub.  Knowledge isn't magic.

1329622287.0,33,self.MLPdrawingschool,pw1hq,Where to shade?  Breaking things into their separate parts before shading.  Complex = Simple.,viwrastupr,39,6,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/pw1hq/where_to_shade_breaking_things_into_their/,"[](/raritysad ""Another shading guide?"")[](/raritywhy ""When will it end?"")Ponies are made up of simpler objects than you would think.  By simplifying how ponies are put together you can easily figure out where shadows go and how they look.  Spheres, cylinders and cubes.  That's really all a pony is.  Think of digital cgi mapping, simplify your shapes then use how you know how to shade simple shapes to shade comlicated pony shaped shapes.  Use your undersketch as a guide, once again, but this time in 3d!

I keep saying there are shadows within shadows, but what do I mean?  And how do shadows fall on simple shapes?

Well [I put together this here set of examples](http://imgur.com/a/WV2Su) to show how simple shadow shapes are.  Numbers correspond to rows in the picture.  

1.  This is usually where newer artists stop.  One shadow, one shade, very boring... dull and lifeless.  Shadows have depth.  There are shadows within shadows.  Notice, the shadow doesn't go all the way at the edge.  This is because whatever the object is resting on will reflect light back up into the object.  This really helps to give the objects a 3d look.  Notice also how the highlights aren't touching the edge.  That's what the F is for.  **Light is either in front of or behind an object.**   To put it directly to the side is... sad and makes it look much more 2d.  

2. Secondary shadows!  Let's look at the circle for this.  Look at how the shadow is a different thickness as we go about the circle?  Inner shadows are *never* parallel to the initial shadow on living forms.  On a perfect cylinder, maybe, but that's not a living form, is it?  Shadows are closer together in areas of quick change (such as the edge) and further away in areas of gradual change.

3.  Tertiary shadows! [](/raritywhine ""This is all too much!"") These here help things look more three dimensional.  Shadows within shadows within shadows.  As we increase in depth *away from the light source* the shadows increase in darkness.  Now, why on the cube are my shadows not going to the edge?  Because there is no such thing as a perfect cube and edges are ludicrously important.  A hard edge of one value meeting another indicates a quick change in the object's plane.  Notice how the edges get darker as we progress?

4.  Darker shadows.  These are the ones that really make your objects pop.  They should follow a similar pattern of shadows within shadows but these take up very little space.  Your darkest darks and your lightest lights will always draw the most attention.  These are important, but should take up very little space overall and need a proper transition.  If there is a gentle sphere, take your time, if it is a quick angle, transition quicker.  

The second image is an example of pushing things that are behind back.  The back cylinder things are behind, so they start with a darker initial value.  Never be afraid to darken a whole spot if it is in shadow.  Something cast in shadow looks farther away and makes the whole piece look better by just using a simple change in initial value.  Push things back to bring other things forwards.  

**Edit:**

Our heads often draw too much distinction between highlights and shadows. Here the body midtone is represented by the initial shadow. The lights/highlights are the white. A light source is implied by every line. Outline, reflected light, highlights, shadows. Every. Last. Line. This is why consistency of light source is so important. Our eyes recognize it immediately, even if our conscious does not.

Or I could say that #4 is the body midtone and most everything is a highlight. Or I could say that the white is the midtone, but the light source is the sun and the highlights are the midtone. The difference between shadow and highlight is pretty arbitrary. Scary, I know, but it is true. All the ponies start out with a body color and we call darker than that a shadow and 
lighter a highlight, but this distinction is really artificial.

**Edit 2:**

There is a lot of change in an organic form towards the edge. This is true for cylinders and spheres. [](/rarityyell ""Why is there always more!"") The closer our eyes get to the edge, the more is happening. The line of light that you see on the edge is both reflected light and a quick change to the normal part of the sphere where the light isn't reflected.

[Flutterducky](http://ponytron5000.deviantart.com/art/Flutterducky-349659992)

Honestly, this just started off as a silly idea and not much else. As I got into it, though, I decided to make this into a challenge of dealing with water and other shiny, reflective, and/or wet surfaces, which I am really not comfortable with at all. As an additional challenge, I decided to do almost the entire thing with a hard-edged square brush because I use a soft round brush entirely too much. I guess you could say it was a texture learning experience.

I think it turned out pretty well considering that I have absolutely no clue what I'm doing with any of those things. I'm particularly pleased with her mane. I'm sure it could be improved, but I've gotta say it looks pretty much like wet rubber to me.

That means sketch train, a fun game in which anyone, regardless of skill level, is encouraged to participate!

For those of you who don't know the rules, here we go!

1. We start with Person A, who lays down a request for a doodle, something like Daisy sniffing a daisy.

2. Person B comes up and draws [Daisy sniffing a daisy.] (http://spicyhamsandwich.deviantart.com/art/Daisy-Sniffing-Daisies-333041388?ga_submit=10%3A1350587979) Aaaanyways, person B now wants to see a picture of Luna turned into a waffle.

3. Person C draws a Luna waffle. Then person C requests his/her own drawing. Person C uploads the drawing and does the request in the SAME POST, THIS IS KEY.

and that's how this game goes! a few rules: try to keep it fairly simple (i'm definitely going to keep it more simple this time, being a bit busy), any medium is fine, don't request your own OC.

this is a laid-back game, and we're all meant to have fun doing it, so please don't hesitate to participate! let's have fun everybody!

I'm going to be gone for a couple hours this afternoon, so my idea is that we'll try doing TWO trains! The first commenter can start one, and then I will start one. I hope people read this so no one is confused.

EDIT: Thanks for another awesome round of sketch train everybody!
