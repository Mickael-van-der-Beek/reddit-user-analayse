1347478100.0,142,self.fnv,zs4o9,A detailed list with links for the best mods for Fallout New Vegas (beginner friendly too),insane0hflex,171,29,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/zs4o9/a_detailed_list_with_links_for_the_best_mods_for/,"Here's a list of mods for Fallout New Vegas, and I heavily recommend getting most (if not all) of them. 

I put a lot of time and effort into this post, and since its a self-post (aka no karma), I'd really appreciate an upvote so that more people can see this list.
Also feel free to link this post to newcomers asking about mods, this should keep 'em busy for a while. =)

Before you get too far (or start a new game), [consider checking out Moburma's FNV Restored Cut-Content Mods](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfRr15Ey_A) - which includes the New Vegas strip without loading doors, a bigger more open Freeside, many new NPCs, and other restored cut content and/or unfinished content. Watch the video for a demonstration of the mods.

However, some of the mods in this list are incompatible with the mods mentioned in the video if you don't start a new game, so keep that in mind and read the mod descriptions carefully.

-----------------------------------

**Installing and uninstalling mods easily**

* I'd recommend picking up [NMM - Nexus Mod Manager](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/modmanager/), to download and install your mods with an easy click of a button. Or you can use [FOMM](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/36901) if you want, although I haven't used it since NMM was released, and I believe NMM is the successor to FOMM. 


* Then, get [BOSS](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6) - which is a mod that works for Oblivion, Skyrim, FO3 and FNV. Its a program that will sort your mod load order to reduce conflicts. You will also be notified if there are mod conflicts that need resolving (aka mod incompatiblities, mod patches needed, etc).

-----------------------------

**Onto the mods now, I consider most of these ""essential"" or ""must have mods""**

* [Project Nevada](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/40040) - A glorious mod with many features - you can sprint, slow down time with action points, throw grenades with a hotkey, and much, much more. It also has a bunch of customization options, to get the experience you want.

* [Dynamic Alternative Roleplayer's Start](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/45739) - allows you to not just create a character, but to craft a history and story for your character. Get random gear and start in a random location.

* [Willow - A Better Companion Experience](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/41779) - adds a fully voiced and professio quality companion. She has her own questline, too. Bethesda and Obsidian should take notes from this mod.

* [Electro-City](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/37908) - Mainly adds a ton of light-posts around the highways and roads in New Vegas - great mod. There is also an option to disable light-posts on highways if you so desire.

* [Vurt's Wasteland Flora Overhaul](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/39856) - Much, much better looking vegetation textures. Comes in 3 versions - Fertile Wasteland, Dead Wasteland, ESP-less ""replacer"" version

* [NMC's Texture Pack](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/43135) - The best HD texture overhaul for New Vegas, in my opinion at least. =)

* [Weapon Retexture Project (WRP)](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/38285) - a WIP mod that retextures most weapons in Fallout New Vegas with a HD texture; most of FNV's guns had a lame low-res texture, and this mod corrects that =)

* [Mission Mojave Ultimate Edition](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/45104) - Floating items, discolored terrain, faulty terrain, broken navmeshes, clipping meshes,  broken scripts, and many other fixes for a total of 20245 records in one download! This mod doesn't add anything new to the game, it simply fixes the issues that exist in the default game. Think of it like a ""Unofficial Fallout New Vegas Patch""

* [Fallout New Vegas Redesigned II](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/39218) - makes NPCs look better, more varied, and more unique so that they match what they should be. Lore friendly.

* [Nevada Skies](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35998) - Great weather mod that adds 60 new weather types, ranging from sand storms to rad storms to thunder storms...lots of storms =). Great mod.

* [Monster Mod](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/41361) - Adds over a hundred new types of monsters to encounter in the game

* You should then download [Rebalanced Level Lists](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/44538) if you get Monster Mod, since Monster Mod is not low-level friendly.

* [AWOP - A World of Pain](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/38719) - A very large mod that adds lots of new locations (sewers and such) and enemies. Consider installing this mod when you are a higher level.

* [Essential Visual Enhancements](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/42666) - This mod overhauls old and implements many new ""visual"" features -including energy weapon effects, enemy reactions,  improved death animations, and even opening animations for containers like cash registers.

* [Interior Lighting Overhaul](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35794) - Overhauls the lighting of all interior cells of (vanilla and all DLCs) to a more realistic and ""fitting"" value, to increase ""immersion and creepiness, especially in vaults, caves and ruins"".

* [Fellout](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34888) removes the orange tint from vanilla FNV

* [More Perks](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35979) - Absolutely love this mod. Adds like 100+ cool new perks to the game. Get this mod with [Perk Every Level](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34707) - which lets you get 1 perk every level rather than 1 perk every two levels, to really maximize the fun.

* [Populated Casinos](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35369) - Many new NPCs are added to the casinos of FNV, giving them a more populated and ""alive"" feel.

* [Dynavision](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/40077) - Adds DoF - very customizable, made by Gopher - an excellent modder.

* [Immersive HUD (iHUD)](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/40340) Hides the HuD when you don't need it, and shows it when you do need it (ie: combat, looking at lootable objects) - also made by Gopher.

* [CONELRAD 640-1240 - Civil Defense Radio](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35061) - awesome new radio station! Uses real sounds from the 50s/60s 

* [Old World Radio](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/47577) - adds 9! new radio stations (and more with future updates!), ranging from old radio shows to 8bit music to 50/60s music. Over 1 GB of new radio goodness!

* [Shiloh DS - Coloured Map and Icons](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35619) - this mod adds a colored world map and custom map icons (for stuff like skillbooks, snow globes and mod vendors) to Fallout New Vegas.

* [NVInteriors Wasteland Project](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/43534) and [NVInteriors Urban Project] - these two mods aim to let you be able to explore houses that are boarded up or that you can't get into, increasing immersion and roleplaying (and hoarding) experience.


**Utility Mods for Better Performance**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


* [New Vegas Stutter Remover](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34832) - Removes the stuttering that happens every 2-3 minutes (for me at least). Also includes an FPS limiter option that you can turn on or off. Can't play FNV without this mod =) This mod requires [New Vegas Script Extender](http://nvse.silverlock.org/)

* [Fake Fallout Fullscreen](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/41381) - a mod which *may* reduce crashes and increase performance, totally optional

* [4GB Fallout New Vegas](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35262) - Makes FNV silky smooth and this mod is required for HD texture or mods that add more NPCs. Make sure you get the version that works with NVSE, since New Vegas Stutter Remover requires NVSE.


**Player Homes**
-----------------------------------

* [Underwater Hideout](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/36121) - A cool and unique underwater home.

* [Rancho Villa](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/46004) - If you are looking for a ranch-styled home.

* [Underground Hideout](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/37884) - ""This Mod adds a Player Vault on the the Wasteland near Spring Mt. Ranch State Park. The vault includes all the amenities including a Armory, ammo Sorters, Weapons wall, water purifier, book shelf, grow area, and is Companion Friendly""


**Quest and New Location Mods**
-------------------------------------------------

* [New Vegas Bounties I](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/37310) - basically accept contracts to kill bad guys, and the enemies get tougher as you progress.

* [New Vegas Bounties II](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/41184) - the sequel to the first one, completing NVB I isn't required, although recommended.

* [Badlands](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/44408) - A sweet and simple quest taking place in a new location, where you need to kill some slavers south of the Mojave Desert in the new location called Geshute Indian Reservation.

* [Beyond Boulder Dome](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/46907) - as of this post, the mod is still in beta, but its really fun. The NPCs are fully voiced, and its a large quest mod taking place in Boulder, Colorado where the main quest has different endings depending on your choices and there are several small side quests too. Amazing quest mod.

* [DEIMOS](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/43411) - a quality quest mod that involves you traveling back in time.

* [Fortune Canyon](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/43925) - adds a bunch of smaller quests focused on treasure hunting.

you about",kinggimped,120,16,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/e3xyu/tips_little_tips_and_tricks_that_the_game_doesnt/,"I (and it seems quite a few other Redditors) have noticed that there are various things in New Vegas that are never properly explained in-game. Some of them are things that were explained in FO3 but they don't bother to get into here, some it seems they just assume the player should know. Let's get a list of these going to help ease the frustration of fellow couriers who got shot in the face.

Please feel free to add your own tips in the comments and I'll add them to this list.

-----

- ### **You can bind weapons to 1-8 on the keyboard (or directions on the D-pad)**

(PC only) As in most FPS games, you can bind guns to the number keys on the keyboard. In New Vegas you can also bind armour, for quick faction disguises, as well as stimpacks and other chems. (Note that you can't bind anything to 2, because it's the default ""change ammo type"" key)

How to do it: in the weapons/apparel screen of your Pipboy, hold down the number you want, and click the weapon/armour you want bound to that key. A little grid will appear with an icon of the weapon in the slot you chose. Now when you want to switch weapons, simply press the assigned number, and the item will be equipped without having to go to your Pipboy. Magic.

You can also hold down the number key outside of the Pipboy screen and it will give you the weapon icon map again.

(Xbox 360/PS3) You can bind weapons, armour and items to 7 of the 8 directions on the D-pad (all directions besides Up, which changes ammo type). To do this, go to your inventory, select the item you want to bind, hold down RB (360) or R2 (PS3) and tap the direction on the D-pad you want to assign that weapon to. (thanks [Ploppy17](http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/e3xyu/tips_little_tips_and_tricks_that_the_game_doesnt/c1544qp) and [ianscuffling](http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/e3xyu/tips_little_tips_and_tricks_that_the_game_doesnt/c15452r) for the console controls)

-----

- ### **You can drag objects around without putting them in your inventory**

On the PC target the item and press the Z key; on Xbox 360 and PS3, target the item and push the right analog button (R3). You can pick up objects and corpses, which gives you the following advantages:

**For items and corpses:** If you want to loot a corpse or steal a skill book or magazine away from the watchful eyes of NPCs, you can grab the item/corpse in full view, and then drag it away from prying eyes and steal/loot it there (note that you'll still incur the karma loss for stealing, you just won't get the reputation loss or have the item taken back from you).

This can be very useful in places like Silver Rush (Freeside), where they have all the super-expensive fully repaired energy weapons just sitting out on the counter.

You can use open doors as cover - so long as it displays [HIDDEN] when you're crouched, nobody can see you put the item in your inventory. Picking up the item with the Z key will have no effect on NPCs.

Even cheekier is this tip from [permanentmarker](http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/e2nv8/i_had_no_idea_you_could_do_this_until_my_friend/c14vke0): if you take a bucket or cooking pot into a place with a lot of ammo lying around (like Silver Rush), you can drag a bunch of ammo into the bucket until it's full, then take it outside and steal it all when you're out of sight. This saves you having to pick up each clip individually, get out of sight, and then pick it up.

You can also move the offending person by pushing them (move straight into them and they'll be pushed backwards) out of the room, leaving the item unguarded (thanks [madaerodog](http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/e3xyu/tips_little_tips_and_tricks_that_the_game_doesnt/c154b3i)).

**For corpses:** Occasionally a corpse will be covering up an item underneath it (or sometimes even a live mine). Also, sometimes when you have corpses piled on top of one another, it's difficult to loot them both since it keeps selecting the same one. Drag the corpse away and it solves both these issues.

-----

- ### **Your Pipboy has a light**

I had played Fallout 3 for about 10 hours before I accidentally discovered this. No more messing with the brightness controls on your monitor/TV! There *is* a flashlight in Fallout, though it's not so much a flashlight as it is like using a mobile phone as a torch. Hold down your Pipboy button (Tab on PC) to switch your Pipboy light on and off.

Remember to turn it off when sneaking/stealing.

-----

- ### **When hacking, you can delete wrong passwords or get an extra guess or 2 by using the 'bracket trick'**

This applies to FO3 as well, it's never explained in-game and can occasionally be quite useful.

You know those junk characters between the words you see when hacking locked terminals? Well, when you see a bunch of characters between brackets, these can actually help you. For example:

`{£^@""&amp;amp;%}`

`[%£""$&amp;amp;@$]`

`&lt;^$£*$%!&gt;`

`(*$£""&amp;amp;""!@)`

When you hover over these, you'll notice that it highlights the whole bracketed bit, rather than each junk character as it usually does. As the above examples show, any valid brackets or parentheses count: (), [], {}, &lt;&gt;.

If you click the bracketed selection, it will randomly either delete an incorrect password from the hacking screen, or will give you an extra guess.

The easy way to spot these is just hover over them - if it selects the whole string instead of individual junk characters, then click it.

Sometimes you'll see extra brackets within a bracket trick - if there are several opening brackets, you can get 2 bracket tricks out of it. For example:

`{%{£^!£&amp;}`

In this case, you can click the {£^!£&amp;} bracket, which will remove the start { but not the end }, leaving you with an extra bracket trick to use.

Worth noting that you may not get an available bracket trick every time you hack a terminal. Sometimes you'll get more than one. Luck of the draw.

It's worth mentioning here for new players that if you've made 3 attempts and still are not sure what the password is, it's much better to exit out of the terminal (click the red power button) and then re-hack it (giving you another 4 attempts) than risk a lockout (which will permanently disable the terminal unless you find the password on a note or are told it by an NPC - which you can't do for most terminals). Yes, that means that the ""Computer Whiz"" perk *is* utterly useless. Don't take it.

-----

- ### **You can plant grenades, mines and explosives on people for a cheap, sneaky kill**

Old trick from Fallout 1/2. If you pickpocket someone (crouch and press the 'Use' key (E on PC) when near them) and place a grenade or mine into their inventory, it will appear in their inventory as ""Live grenade"" or ""Live mine"". Upon exiting the screen, get clear of them, because in a couple of seconds they're going to blow up. You'll also be credited 1 kill under the ""Pants exploded"" bit in your stats. :)

Do note that even though your victim won't see you putting the explosive in their pocket (and even if they did, they've only got seconds to live), this trick does tend to anger those around you, and they will probably start attacking you once your victim explodes. If you're in a crowded room, better to keep your distance and go for a silent sneak attack critical. (thanks [drBlack884](http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/e3xyu/tips_little_tips_and_tricks_that_the_game_doesnt/c1540tm))

REMEMBER: the effectiveness of pickpocketing relies on the same things as sneaking. A high sneak skill obviously helps, and so does approaching them from behind; but remember to turn off your Pipboy light (see above) and radio so they don't see/hear you coming. *Always quicksave before pickpocketing.*

-----

- ### **You can ['reverse pickpocket'](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Planting_items) people to steal their equipped items**

If you're trying to pickpocket something that an NPC has equipped (for example a unique gun or armour), it won't show up in the pickpocket screen. But fear not - by using the old Fallout trick of 'reverse pickpocketing' (also known as the 'Shady Sands Shuffle'), you can get these items.

Basically, reverse pickpocketing works like this: if you give them a better item, they'll equip that item, and then the item they had equipped before will appear in their inventory on the pickpocket screen.

For weapons, the damage/DPS has to be higher than the item they currently have equipped. Likewise, for armour, the DR has to be higher than their current equipped armour.

Once you've planted the better item in their inventory, you have to wait until they equip the new item. There are several ways to do this:

- Leave the area and come back a while later (use the wait command or sleep).

- Leave the area, quicksave, quickload, go back to the area.

If the item you've planted is better, they will have equipped it, leaving their previous equipment ripe for the pickpocketing.

Related tip: if you want to steal somebody's hat or headgear but don't have a better hat to put in their inventory, you can equip them with a radiation suit or similar item. Since you can't wear headgear when wearing these, they'll have to unequip them when they put the radiation suit on - meaning the unequipped stuff will show up in their inventory.

Be aware that reverse pickpocketing will still result in karma loss, even though you are technically *giving* them stuff - both the giving and the taking will lose you karma (though since karma doesn't play much of a part in New Vegas, it really doesn't matter very much).

No, because Boone kept his gun out, and starting shooting the shit out of the NCR troopers. I watched in horror as I became vivified by the NCR.

And you know what Boone does? He turns around, and says to me: ""I don't work against the NCR, I'm out of here.""

You guys pretty much said to stick with it, so I did and am absolutely loving it now.

Some specific things:

 - No subway system.  Travelling above ground is such a relief.  I remember getting completely lost and frustrating trying to navigate through the endless tunnels of FO3.

 - Replayability. I love when I complete a quest on the strip and suddenly get a notification that I just failed 3 other quests.  It means that I can get a totally new experience playing through again.

 - Enemy diversity - In FO3, I felt like I was just constantly battling a sea of super mutants.  I'm optimistically only a third of the way through the game, and already the different people/creatures I've ran into is astounding.

 - Decent writing - This might be the biggest factor. In FO3, I would commonly skip past the dialogue, just to get to the quests, but in NV, I exhaust every single character's dialogue choices just because they actually have interesting things to say.

So, you can call me a convert.",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,False,,,True,t3_1d5wfp,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/1d5wfp/you_guys_were_right_new_vegas_is_amazing/,

(I figured a war poster at war would be fitting)

I got a reply stating that they didn't exist, but that he would send me something else instead.  I received a lunchbox with all kinds of goodies inside.  As a thanks, I had a friend of mine dress up and I took these photos.  Feel free to use them however you like

I came across a quest to get Yao Guai gauntlet, Rite of Passage I think? So I'm like ""fuck yeah, that sounds sweet!"" and I go around and do the prerequisite plant gathering to do the main part of this quest.

For those of you who haven't done this quest the plants you gather are drugs, and cause an interface screw, and also prevent you from fast traveling. So of course I'm wondering around the Sorrow's camp for ten minutes, looking for an exit, and when I finally find it I encounter [Joshua Graham](/spoiler) and have a conversation with him essentially about the other DLC's.

Now I'll come back to that, but first I have to describe this fucking epic quest. All you have to do is kill a unique Yao Guai (The Ghost of She). From the Wiki: 
    This yao guai is an oversized variant with a flaming body. It has a phenomenal attack power which can kill a heavily armored person in just a few blows, and after taking enough damage can create several doppelgangers of itself. Some of her strange physical characteristics are a result of the Courier being under the influence of a datura derived drug.
 And along with that, some giant Cazadors had decided to join in on the fight. It was epic, but I was victorious. 

So, high off the thrill of victory, I march back to the camp, thinking about my conversation with [Graham](/spoiler) . And this gets me thinking about the themes of all the DLC. Love, lust, Revenge, Nostalgia, Greed. And I realized why the DLC, why Fallout New Vegas, is so great. Despite all the info dumps and walls of texts and just so much textual exposition: the world is amazing. The maps of each of the DLC express all of these themes in such an astonishingly visual manner, putting you into the actions and consequences of following those base emotions. Regardless of they're flaws these DLC's, and New Vegas itself, achieve a level of story telling and depth that most games simply do not match. 

I was all ready to sit down and play through the other three, i was excited to look for all of that depth and meaning, to really experience the game!

Then it crashed.

And that's New Vegas in a surprisingly large nutshell.",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,False,,,True,t3_11a3e4,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/11a3e4/new_vegas_in_a_nutshell/,

I was actually loading an old character where I used an exploit to level up really high before I leave goodsprings. This time I decide it is finally time to go North instead of south, which I always go.
I get near to the edge where it asks me if I want to redo my character...and I say yes so I am back at level one waiting to add the points in again.

Before I can level back up I get a *Caution* so I crouch down and hide thinking it is a rad scorpion. I can't level up until the caution is gone so I wait. I keep waiting but it does not seem to be going away so I decide to go back into town and go indoors. After taking a couple of steps *Danger* starts to flash. I turn around once again thinking scorpion....nope....Deathclaw. 

So I start running back to town. I am level 1 with only shit weapons and this thing is attacking. After hitting me a couple of times I finally duck into the bar with little health thinking I am safe(er). As I get inside Sunny Smiles and company go to protect me against the deathclaw. So while they are doing that I hide in the bathroom.I hear one by one die and the deathclaw still breathing. So now its like a scene out of jurassic park. I am hiding in the bathroom and can only hear the deathclaw breathing....and then walking....toward me. Slowly he walks up to the door, and opens it....and attacks.

and I am dead...but it was pretty epic.

Also I'm not using any mods + never seen the area before in previous playthroughs. This is a PC version.
Anyone know what it is?

UPDATE: With some time I was able to replicate the bug. I managed to take two more screenshots before it vanished. Although, before it disappeared i noticed right before it vanished the game loaded way more buildings and objects then what you see in the pictures. What is the best way to capture video of it? also how do i give you the game save?

UPDATE #2: I think I figured out what it is, and it still does not make sense although its not as exciting as I would have expected. I opened the console and clicked on an NPC, It was an electro city engineer (mod) which I don't have installed... maybe thats why it disappears. I can say that I never saw that settlement before when I did have the mod installed. Very strange. 

UPDATE #3: Managed to get and ID on Electro City Master Engineer: fLokii"" (0a012c63) and also a look at it with more buildings and stuff. Enjoy.

**Barbarian Character**.
Through some sort of magic, a sorcerer you were hunting down has transported you and himself into the Mojave. Others who can't explain what happen say he shot you in the head. All you know is you are after this sorcerers life and will stop at nothing to kill him or others that try to keep you from your goal and conquer this strange land in your name.

This play through will limit you to using only melee and unarmed weapons. You know nothing about explosives, energy wepons or science. Higher strength and endurance is also a must, with low intellegence. Use Intimidating Presence as much as possible and never let anyone stand in your way.

**Predator Character**
Your ship has dropped you off in this human wasteland to eliminate your target. He killed your brother and you had to take his place and kill the one named Benny. Sneak around this wastelands inhadbitants and kill them when they least expect it. After you kill the man who murdered your brother, clear this land of the mutant filth. then conquer it for your brothers.

This play through will limit you to using Energy weapons and unarmed. You are very intellegnt and perceptive, but also immensely strong. Normal guns are inferior and do not even deserve to be held in your hands. Obtain Power armor as soon as possible. Sneak around your enemies and kill anyone who discovers you.

**Alien Character**

You and your crew were flying over the Mojave when suddenly your ship took fire from a camp across from what the humans call ""Hoover Dam"" and crash landed on the out skirts of the region. You wake up inside a human's house and quickly panic because you think he can see your alien form. But your cloaking device has triggered and is jammed on. You must wander the wasteland and search for your crew in efforts to bring them home, but in the meantime, crush whoever shot your ship down and obliterate them.

This play through will limit you to energy weapons, science, and speech. High intelligence, luck, and agility will get you around most situations. Do not waste your time killing petty humans unless it is absolutely necessary. Instead rely only superior thought.

I hope this gives you guys some more fun play throughs for FNV. The game is certainly more fun when you have a back story!",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,False,,,True,t3_z00ya,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/z00ya/getting_bored_after_a_few_play_throughs/,

The labels are all original by me, except the Nutrition Facts table is a modified version of one I found online, so credit to whoever made that. I used a Tyskie bottle (Polish beer) because it was pretty much the only brown glass bottle with no branding on it. I took some creative liberties but all in all I'm pretty pleased with how it turned out :)
I've made a Nuka Cola label, but I am yet to find a suitable bottle to fix  it to, any suggestions?

I liked the idea so I built on it to make what I call ""gentleman's rules"", both for challenge and for roleplaying. They're based on maintaining dignity and style in the Wasteland, and a James Bond-ish aesthetic. What I came up with:

-Build your character with Charisma and Luck as their highest stats. Take Lady Killer or Confirmed Bachelor as your first perk (or Black Widow or Cherchez le Femme if you're a Jane Bond).

-You wear only nice clothes, pre-war businesswear preferably but at least pre-war casualwear or relaxedwear. No armor (unless using it as a faction disguise). Viva Las Vegas is exceptable to wear unless you want to stick to not wearing armor for the challenge.

-Only use pistols and SMG's for guns, and the knife, combat knife, 9 iron, straight razor, or katana for melee. No dynamite, only grenades or C4 for explosives.

-Play Hardcore mode, but you can't drink any dirty/irradiated water. You also don't eat unprepared meat, the meat of bugs, dogs, molerats, or coyotes, pork and beans, cave fungus, or anything served on a stick. Only quality cooked meat, vegetables/fruits, and packaged food, basically.

-Don't sleep outdoors.

-You have a drink of choice, and will only drink either vodka, scotch, or wine for alcohol. 

-You can't take Jet, Rocket, Psycho, Slasher, Buffout, or any tribal recipe or insect derived chems.

-No scavenging from trashcans or dumpsters.

-No stealing or taking items from obviously owned homes/areas. If you can't resist stealing or taking an owned item, you have to leave enough caps behind to pay for it.

Back the NCR as a former military covert operative, the Legion as a frumentarii, or House or Yes Man as, I dunno, some badass.

I couldn't hack it for long on Very Hard, I'm playing it on Hard right now and just got to the Mojave Outpost. It's difficult but cool, I'm enjoying it. I started with Good Natured and Trigger Discipline traits and have taken Lady Killer and Intense Training for perks so far (and planning to get The Professional at 6).

Any thoughts?

The Legion is painted as the default ""Bad guys"". Which is ok, I'm not trying to argue that a society that exists on slavery should be super likable, but I feel that they made them too cartoon-ishly evil.  I think what they could have done is offered the player a chance for glory and power that the NCR doesn't. 

They did a really good job in showing how each faction had both good and bad aspects, except for the Legion. NCR is built on the aspects of democracy and is trying to rebuild the world like it was, but they are expansionist, somewhat condescending to locals, and riddled with bureaucracy and corruption.  House is a man with a plan, a master strategist and also has a plan for rebuilding society, even advancing it from what it was before the war, but he cares nothing about any group of people and refuses to let anyone or any group have power besides himself.  Going independent means the most freedom for the people of the region, but it also means a loss of structure and law.  There's no ""right"" answer, but yet the Legion is made to be the wrong one. 

It seems like the designers want you to automatically hate the Legion. They constantly refer to you as profligate and Caesar is so dismissive, even after I [took a damn tumor out of his brain](/spoiler) that its hard to resist ending him on the spot.  If Caesar had welcomed you as powerful ally and then offered you incentives to join his cause (wealth, power, slaves, glory, territory) it might have made the game a bit deeper.    

Its also not helped by the fact that despite being one of the three big powers in the Mojave, the Legion still looks like a bunch of raiders playing dress up.  If the fort had been more opulent instead of a makeshift camp it might have suggested ""Yeah these guys are brutal, but they have managed to build a society.""  They might have also included more Legion territory so you could see the effects of the legion on a larger scale. Like a town that thrives under the Legion's model.  If the game maybe had the guts to suggest ""Slavery is horrible for human freedom, but there's no denying it can get stuff done."" 

TL;DR - I think the Legion could have been done better, rather than just being ""default evil faction""

Is there anywhere I could make a request for a Mod that basically does this? I'd do it myself but I have no modding experience.  ",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,True,,,True,t3_kwmgy,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/kwmgy/does_anyone_else_wish_they_had_made_the_legion/,

While thinking about *where* it should take place, I found myself increasing intrigued by contemplating *when* it should take place.

I think a Fallout set in the immediate aftermath of the nuclear war of 2077 would be exciting.  Perhaps 2078 would be a good year.  

Ghouls would be new and people's reaction to them would be less jaded and casual and more OMG WTF panic! 

Maybe the player could even retrace the existing Fallout backstory to an extent; perhaps his story could link with that of the Army unit that eventually became the Brotherhood of Steel.

The player could encounter actual Chinese military units left over from an invasion.

The game could start with the character being forced outside a Vault as a forced recon volunteer, since 1 year after the war everyone in the Vault is dying to know what's going on outside.

Or maybe the player is a guy who didn't get into a Vault and is struggling to survive, ""The Road""-style?

Maybe this Fallout could add vehicles, if not for the player than as enemies?  Chinese tanks, perhaps.  It would, however, be cool if the player could create an improvised armored car, [Libyan-rebel style](http://www.nationaljournal.com/the-homemade-weapons-of-libya-s-rebel-forces-20110615).  The player could drive in real-time while using VATS to aim the gun.  Once you've programmed your shots into VATS and unpaused, the gun would fire off-screen while you drive.  Each vehicle could have a certain number of Action Points, or you could have a ""Driving"" skill that affects vehicle AP.

Edit: Perception could set Driving Action Points, while Agility sets normal Action Points.  That would make Perception a more worthwhile attribute.

What else could be done with a 2078 Fallout?",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,True,,,True,t3_i2lkf,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/i2lkf/fallout_2078/,

Live off of the land, maybe avoid the whole main quest for a long time. I just got the DLC for Old World Blues, but I knew my character needed experience and a level of about 16 or 17 to make a good go of it. My character was at level 10. What should he do?

He decided to clear out the quarry by Sloan. He went and picked up ratslayer at Broc Flower Cave (and had a nice little fight with some ROUSes, which apparently do exist).

We had a nasty run in with Cazadors north of Good Springs and in turning a corner met a young Death Claw. It nearly killed us. So we decided we'd hunt. We'd hunt deathclaws! With ratslayer.

Into the quarry he went, high up on the ridge on the right side as you enter it from Sloan. From that vantage point, he slowly, slowly took out 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 deathclaws. All of his ammo was spent. So he retreated. He proceeded to pick up any kind of ammo that would help - regular, armor piercing, hallow point. He returned. This time he worked his way around to the Khan makeshift camp and the meetup above. Slowly he worked down and finally ... 

All ammo was used in taking the Alpha and the Deathclaw mother. From high above he could see them. All day and all night. At the end of it, he crawled to the campsite and slept. The Khans let him be, he'd done them a service and were on good terms with him.

He left the next morning to get ammo. Upon returning, he saw ... all the young deathclaws and others still around. He set to his task. By the end of the day, they were all dead. He'd crept down and spent all his ammunition. He pulled out his trusty .357, Lucky, and finished off a deathclaw at close range. He finished the last young death claw with a grenade.

Exhausted, he took all the claws, eggs, the fat man, mini nukes and the light rifle. He's earned this. Yet he was now over encumbered! He could no longer run or fast travel. So he slowly worked his way back out towards Sloan. Suddenly a red light turned up on his compass. He panned right. A deathclaw. Lucky was low on ammo. What to do? He quickly armed the fat man and flung the mini nuke in a desperate attempt to survive. The explosion threw him to the ground. But the red blip was gone and so was the deathclaw- carcass and all.

Level 14. Damn. But he'd done it. With Lucky, Ratslayer, 2 grenades and a fat man. A job well done. Soon, Old World Blues, soon.",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,False,,,True,t3_110yiz,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/110yiz/a_battle_to_the_deathclaw/,

March 22th, 2283

Command approved the mission - 15 of us going into the Mojave, posing as a caravan. Intel claims we'll be dead within 3 days if we're discovered. I think those eggheads are underestimating us, but I can see their point - don't provoke the bucketheads.

March 28th, 2283

Passed through the old Mojave Outpost today. Statues are surprisingly still standing. Securitron checkpoint refused to let us pass without paying for a passport. Some things never change.

April 1st, 2283

Finally saw some action today - raiders tried to ambush us, saw them coming a mile away. Must be a new gang - from what I hear they don't last long before she pays them a visit. One of them injured Jones' leg with a grenade, she won't be able to walk for a few days.

April 2nd, 2283

When we walked into Novac today I thought we had the wrong place. Place was guarded by Ghouls. In robes. Now I've seen everything.

April 4th, 2283

Intel was right, our target still walks the Mojave. You'd think a woman like that would make more noise when she passes through these small towns, though.

April 5th, 2283

Wasted the entire day tracking a power armor signature - we heard the target used one at the Dam. Close but no cigar - just some gal keeping an old Brotherhood armor in her shack. Pleasant girl, but we're not out here for that.

We've been had. The ""good luck charm"" that bitch gave us was a homing beacon. Reams found the transmitter a little too late. By the time we backtracked to that shack she was already gone.

April 6th, 2283

Spent the whole night tracking her, but we were too late. She'd made it inside New Vegas. Those 3 days are already ticking. It's not all bad - we got a solid lead on the target. One of the junkies in Freeside claimed he saw her stocking up at Gun Runners before heading east.

April 7th, 2283

I don't know what happened. We finally found her. We had barely laid eyes on her when she opened fire with a .308. Reams and Thomas got hit before they could get in cover. Then she aimed HELIOS One at us, lost Jenkins. Hill was lining up a shot, but said she'd disappeared in a flash of blue light. We tried to pick up a trail, but she had vanished.
I didn't think cutting off New Vegas' head would be easy, but when we get beat at our own game...

April 8th, 2283

Made a base of operations in Vault 34. Place was riddled with skeletons and picked clean. It still has power and it's about as hidden away and secure as we can get in this. Cooper and Ward are gathering more intel.

April 12th, 2283

I don't like it. Almost a week since contact and nobody's come after us. We can't complete our mission if we're holed up in here. Ward came back yesterday - no luck. Still no word from Cooper.

April 14th, 2283

Cooper radioed in using the old Black Mountain equipment. Seems he found out how that bitch got away.

April 18th, 2283

Just as Cooper said, a crashed and barely functional satellite, supposedly housing old world teleportation tech. So that's what happened. Ward's been trying to hack into it, no luck.

April 21st, 2283

After staking it out for 2 days it happened. She arrived at the satellite just as we guessed. Like the last time, she noticed us so fast we might as well have planted a 30 foot NCR flag on the ridge. But we were ready. Mines, charges and snipers. Her riot gear took a lot of beating, but she kept on moving. Had to scatter when she pulled a Fat Man on us. She escaped in the confusion, but Hill managed to hit her teleportation device. We've been tracking her for 15 hours.

April 22nd, 2283

Coyotes, radscorpions, giant ants, even Cazadors. We're on her trail, but the wildlife is determined to slow us down. Cooper got stung pretty bad, had to leave him behind.

April 24th, 2283

A vault. Why does it always have to be a vault? Ward says he still needs time to open her up. I don't like it, gives her time to prepare. She hadn't called for aid all this time and she wasn't likely to do it now. We have to get in there and take that chip.

April 25th, 2283

We sealed the door behind us. Ward had rigged it up so that it would take her hours to reconnect the circuits. That's why we lost.
She had us. She knew exactly what we would do. She never set up any mines or explosives. Didn't chase after us and didn't send her bucketheads at us. Why? So she could lead us underground and lock us in a living tomb. She slipped out, I don't know how, but she's not in here. Our only hope is that Cooper finds us.

April 30th, 2283

Running low on food. Mantises that creep in through the cracks aren't enough anymore. In the time it took us to break in, she'd been fixing the place up. Ward said the way she'd jury rigged the generators and reprogrammed the water filtration was nothing short of brilliant. Yeah right, a brilliant way of keeping us alive in this hellhole. She'll get what's coming to her.

May 3rd, 2283

She's playing with us. The doors just swung open on their own, and there was Cooper. Says the courier found him bleeding out, patched him up and told him where we were and when the door would open up. Told us to ""pack our shit and get out."" What a crock. We're setting off after we've recovered.

May 12th, 2283

Woke up in Freeside. After following the courier into the 3rd hole in the ground she finally set up a trap - gas. We've been out for 2 days. Followers took care of us and the Kings confiscated all our guns and meds. Seems we have a choice - get out of the Mojave or take our chances against a pack of Deathclaws. I guess these folks aren't as familiar with the Rangers as we thought.

May 13th, 2283

Deathclaws aren't a problem. Deathclaws surrounded by enough radiation to melt our optics is another story. They left out the second bit on purpose. Radiation isn't something we can just work around. Jones broke down and surrendered - we'll be out of the Mojave in 2 days.

June 23rd, 2283

Good morning, Pete. I've spent the last month tracking down your pals after they escaped their cells. Good soldiers, a shame they had to be so stubborn. You Rangers need to understand the Mojave is MINE. I've known about you ever since you passed that checkpoint. The ambush at the Drive-In was good, I'll give you that. You had plenty of chances to get out. Now that's not an option anymore. I poisoned the supplies you bought yesterday. You have about 10 more hours before your organs turn to goo. And thanks for all the mines you kindly left out for me. I'm sure your surviving friends will just LOVE to find a memento of you under their pillows.

General Oliver, I know this will get to you eventually. Don't try this again, or your soldiers are suddenly going to have a lot more to do.",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,True,,,True,t3_ljtlz,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/ljtlz/extracts_from_the_decoded_journal_of_an_ncr/,

I currently live there. Fallout: New Vegas is my favorite game in a long time, and I think this partly has to do with how many of the places in the game refer to actual places in Las Vegas. I think a bunch of these might be lost on the average non-vegas-native, so I've decided to compile a few here:

Helios One is [Solar One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Solar_One)

REPCONN is [PEPCON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEPCON_disaster), an industrial plant that made rocket fuel and EXPLODED in 1988. Happened 10 miles outside of the city but it could be clearly heard--and felt. When I first saw REPCONN I made this connection almost instantly, [and I was a little bummed when it's only quest didn't end in a massive explosion.](/spoiler)

Black Mountain is [Black Mountain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mountain_(Nevada), basically a deserted mountain near Vegas where some broadcast towers are stationed.

I'll add more later... Busy now. Feel free to add some yourselves!

EDIT 1: 

Nellis refers to [Nellis Air Force Base](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellis_Air_Force_Base)

Ruby Hill Mine is the ghost town [Ruby Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Hill,_Nevada). In FNV, the mine is filled with water. Could be a reference to the storm that washed out the town in 1910.

The [Yangtze Memorial](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Yangtze_Memorial) is the [Mt. Soledad Memorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Soledad), which is actually in San Diego.

[Goodsprings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodsprings_Schoolhouse) is actually in central Nevada, and it's schoolhouse is on the National Register of Historic Places.

EDIT 2:

Fixed a possible spoiler. 

I was hoping to see [Yucca Mountain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Mountain) in the game (a nuclear waste dump, I mean come on!). Maybe we'll see some DLC that includes it.

Another obvious one: The Lucky 38 is [The Stratosphere Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere_Las_Vegas).

Camp McCarran is [McCarran International](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarran_International_Airport).",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,True,,,True,t3_e8vsw,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/e8vsw/consistencies_between_new_vegas_and_current_vegas/,

1343325259.0,42,self.fnv,x78b1,Something to think about if you have hollow-point ammo available [x-post r/fallout],Alexander_D,51,9,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/x78b1/something_to_think_about_if_you_have_hollowpoint/,"Ok so here goes! I've always wondered how HP ammo could be effective at all against armoured foes, so I decided to find out! The standard damage formula in-game is:

* DAM - DT = DAM(final)

With hollow-point ammo, this becomes:

* 1.75 DAM - 3 DT = DAM(final)

Now, basic math says that if we merge these into a simultaneous equation, we can find the point at which hollow-points deal the same final damage that normal rounds do (for the same enemy DT). This yields:

* 1.75 DAM - 3 DT = DAM - DT
* 1.75 DAM - DAM = 3 DT - DT (rearranged)
* 0.75 DAM = 2 DT 
* DAM = (2/0.75) DT
* DAM = 2.667 (or two and two thirds) DT

From this we can see that **if your DAM is greater than 2.667 times the enemy's DT, hollow-points are actually more efficient than normal ammo**. Let me demonstrate with some examples: 

* Cazadores have zero DT, thus HP ammo is automatically better because of the damage boost.
* Deathclaws (excluding babies) and Robobrains have a DT of 15. This means that a weapon with a DAM of (15 x 2.667) = 40 or more is *better off* using HP ammo against them.
* Brotherhood Paladins (the most heavily-armoured enemies in-game AFAIK) have a DT of up to 31. In this case, HP ammo is better if your DAM is (31 x 2.667) = 82.67 = *83 or more*.

Now that last example isn't very promising except in 1 (potentially 2) case(s): Those of the Brush Gun and Medicine Stick, whose DAM (Ican only speak for the Brush Gun here) can easily reach 120 with the right perks. 

So it could be said that with a DAM of 83 or more, HP ammo is **always** a better option than standard ammo! Even ignoring that, a DAM of 40 is very achievable using .308 weapons such as Paciencia (GRA weapon).

**EDIT NUMBER ONE AS REQUESTED BY RANDOMTHERAPY: HP v AP, HP v SWC AMMO.**

*HOLLOW POINT VERSUS ARMOUR PIERCING:*

* 1.75 DAM - 3 DT = 0.95 DAM - (DT - 15)
* 0.8 DAM = 2 DT + 15
* For D/claws: DAM = 57 to be better than AP ammo
* For BoS Paladins: DAM = 97 (still achievable!) to be better than AP ammo

*HOLLOW POINT VERSUS SWC AMMO:* NOTE THAT SWC IS .45-70 ONLY, NOT 0.308

* 1.75 DAM - 3 DT = 1.2 DAM - (DT - 6)
* 0.55 dam = 2 DT + 6
* D/claws: DAM = 66 DAM to be better than SWC
* BoS Paladins: DAM = 124 (achievable with the right perks, possibly only for Medicine Stick) to be better than SWC

In another conclusion, when using high-end lever-action .45-70 Govt. weapons, HP ammo is *invariably better than standard or AP ammo, reflected in it's relative rarity.*

**EDIT NUMBER TWO:**

randomtherapy also mentioned lower DAM guns such as the All American and in this case (and the case of other weapons where HP ammo is unavailable) I can show that AP ammo is *always* better than standard ammo unless your DAM is (literally) modded to 300:

* DAM - DT = 0.95 DAM - (DT - 15)
* 0.05 DAM = 15
* DAM is 300 for standard ammo to be superior to AP ammo.

I took the exit and drove about 10 minutes into town.  Then, I took a stab at comparing the Prospector's Saloon in-game with the historical Pioneer Saloon.

Okay, this might sound weird for you guys but, i'm really a fan of the game and from some old songs, and i think you guys would atleast think what i'm going to say is interesting.


After ""Dead Money"" came out i was crazy to play it, i got it a few weeks after the release, after playing though i was curious about some coincidences, i don't know if any of you guys ever heard about a band called ""Eagles"" and their song ""Hotel California"", but if you're planning on playing Dead money or did it already, hear the song, i'll explain now why.


These are the lyrics of the song:


On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair 
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air 
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light 
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim 
I had to stop for the night 
There she stood in the doorway; 
I heard the mission bell 
And I was thinking to myself, 
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"" 
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way 
There were voices down the corridor, 
I thought I heard them say...


(This part of the song obviously shows the beginning of the DLC, where the courier receives the recorded message, the ""mission bell"" guided him to the place where it all starts, and it hears the voices coming from the radio on that small table.)


Welcome to the Hotel California 
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) 
Such a lovely face 
Plenty of room at the Hotel California 
Any time of year (Any time of year) 
You can find it here


(Refers to the abandoned Sierra Madre Hotel/Casino, which was really a ""lovely"" place before the bombs)


Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends 
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends 
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat. 
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget


(Vera Keyes, The pre-war starlet mentioned and the one who served as inspiration for Frederik's construction of the hotel, she had many friends, one of them, the founder of Sierra Madre, Frederik Sinclair, along with the ""How they dance in the courtyard"" can be explain a vision she had of the Gala when the bombs arrived, she was in her room, but i don't remember if it had windows...)


So I called up the Captain, 
""Please bring me my wine"" 
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine"" 
And still those voices are calling from far away, 
Wake you up in the middle of the night 
Just to hear them say...
(I couldn't think anything about the first two lines of this part but, moving on, ""And still those voices are calling from far away"", the ghost people in the villa.)


Welcome to the Hotel California 
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) 
Such a lovely face 
They livin' it up at the Hotel California 
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise) 
Bring your alibis


(Once again it's talking about the ghost people, but the ""What a nice surprise"" can also remember the player from the moment he arrived at the hotel, noticing the ""Gala Event"" wasn't what he expected...)


Mirrors on the ceiling, 
The pink champagne on ice 
And she said ""We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"" 
And in the master's chambers, 
They gathered for the feast 
They stab it with their steely knives, 
But they just can't kill the beast


(The Gala Event, the moment where everyone gathered to the great moment... which was stopped by the bombs, ""We are all prisioners here, of our own device"" will soon record the DLC players from the device on their necks, but it did also made me remember from Vera's words, ""Let go"" painted on the wall, referring to the final where the player had troubles on the vault's end.)


Last thing I remember, I was 
Running for the door 
I had to find the passage back 
To the place I was before 
""Relax, "" said the night man, 
""We are programmed to receive. 
You can check-out any time you like, 
But you can never leave!""


(This was the best part in my opinion, [i felt chills '-'] the player running for the door, the vault self destructing, he had to find the passage back, to the mojave wasteland [The place he was before], the night man was in my mind like the message left in the vault's computer, which says a bit about the Hotel, and after read, will lock you there forever, afterall, you could check the vault and the hotel any time you like, but you could never leave...)

(Character Build / New Player Advice),Ganrao,52,14,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/y6d37/new_to_vegas_read_this_character_build_new_player/,"I keep seeing people posting requests for advice, and I have reposted the majority of this information in 3 different threads so far. Maybe if it has its own thread it will answer peoples' questions before they make more ""im new what do I do"" threads. Feel free to comment with corrections / more specific advice.

**SPECIAL At Character Creation**

*The most important SPECIAL stats are the ones that let you get access to the Perks and weapons (str requirements) you need to play the type of character you want.* As in, there are melee / unarmed perks that require Str and End, and gun perks that require Per and Agi, etc...

The most valuable stat hands down, not considering Perks, is Endurance, because it determines the number of implants you can have. Each point in Endurance is basically a free point in 1 other SPECIAL, and if you have 10 Endurance you can get all 8 (getting End when you're already at 10 doesn't do anything iirc, or I'd say 9) vanilla implants with room for 2 more from DLC.

If you want a well rounded character that has access to lots of Perks, Endurance and the Intense Training Perk (which can be taken up to 10 times) is your friend. However, the most SPECIAL you ever need for a Perk is 8, and only in Endurance (already covered, woo), and Agility for running faster while sneaking (7 covers all the damage related Perks). That means you can easily set yourself up to get almost any Perk combination you want in the game if you plan it properly during creation. Oh and beating Lonesome Road gives you +1 to any 1 SPECIAL as well, but by the time you do that the game would probably be over for you.

Here is a handy reference to which SPECIALs unlock which Perks: 

http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_primary_statistics

And for Str requirements:

http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_weapons

As a new player you will really appreciate the bonus HP you'll get from having 9-10 Con as well. I don't advise trying a light armor sneaky build really until you understand where **the game will really fuck you good for trying a light armor sneaky build** and being prepared for it. One of the best things you can do for yourself besides starting with high Endurance is taking the Toughness perk twice (for 6 Damage Threshold bonus) and the Subdural Implant (obtained from a doctor near New Vegas proper for 8,000 caps) that gives you another +4 DT. The Lifegiver perk gives you another 30 hp (more than a single level up or a point in Endurance gives) as well if you want to be super hard to kill (you do). Finally, if you want to be truly invinceble while learning the game, try to do the Brotherhood of Steel quest line as early as possible so you can gain access to Power Armor. As an added bonus using Power Armor gives you +1-2 bonus Strength depending on the model, so you only need to reach 8-9 Str through Implants / Perks / beginning build points to use any weapon in the game. Noteworthy 10 Str iconic weapons would be the Minigun and Bumper Swords. Super Sledges only require 9 Str iirc, though, and are a fine ""end game"" melee weapon to specialize in. Following what I just told you, you would be death incarnate. Just pick 1 of the 4 weapon types (explosives don't really count) to specialize in and you're good to go. Remember that Melee and Unarmed attacks do double damage if you use VATS targetting with them and they are viable, especially if you follow my tanky build advice. As well, not needing to manage ammo is nice sometimes and can save you a lot of money mid to late game since you can just sell all the ammo you find. Early game you probably should still keep a gun like a 9mm (they are everywhere early game, so easy to repair and find ammo for) on hand until you get some decent armor and unarmed / melee weapons.

**Perk Selection Is Easy**

You get 25 Perk selections if you have all the DLC, so don't stress about this. You get more than enough to take every Perk related to your weapon(s) of choice, and then some useful utility ones like Rad Resistance, Rad Absorbtion, Lifegiver, Stonewall, Recycler, Jury Rigging, and Toughness. Don't be afraid of using a Perk or two on Intense Training if you need to get your Strength up for a weapon, you want more Implant slots and didn't start the game with 10 Endurance, are short for another Perk you want, etc...

Don't take VATS Perks like Commando or Sniper unless you are into medium range weapons that are hard to aim sometimes due to having a high spread or slow projectile (most plasma weapons fall under this). If you're using long range weapons you'll easily kill many enemies with sneak attacks at far greater range than VATS will let you target things. If you're using close range weapons (SMGs, assault rifles) you'll probably run out of AP before you've come anywhere close to killing all the enemies near you. The exception to this is if you're a melee / unarmed build, which VATS is awesome for because it makes all of your swings do double damage. This works best with high damage single hit weapons like Baseball Bats, Super Sledges, Power Fists, or Ballistic Fists, less great with damage over time stuff like Rippers and Chainsaws imo.

**Skill Selection Is Also Easy**

You get +1 SP per TWO Int. That means if you take 4 Int and the Educated perk (provides 2 bonus SP at level up) you'll get as many as someone with 8 Int. Since SPECIALs are harder to manage than Skills or Perks in New Vegas (over 700 SP to spend with only 4 Int and the Educated perk) you really can get away with just taking Educated and keeping your Int at 4. As with perk selection, specialize in one weapon type. After that, Lockpick and Science can get you a lot of bonuses / make solving things easier. Science is very useful, but Lockpick will get you more loot and a lot of the times where you would need a Science check (hacking) or a key to unlock a door, you can just Lockpick it instead (a lot faster). That being said, Science gives you cool recipes, more dialogue options, and helps you finish quests beyond just hacking terminals. I have yet to run into a dialogue option granted by Lockpick. Get Speech if you are into role playing and solving things more diplomatically, it will let you convince people that fighting is not worth it when resolving a number of quests. Barter will make your transactions more favorable while buying and selling, and sometimes lets you ask for bigger rewards from quests. If you want to save money, Repair can save you heaps with the Jury Rigging perk. High end items cost around 10k caps to fully repair if you pay an NPC to do it for you, but this IS an option if you don't want to level Repair skill.

700 skill points will get you almost 10 skills maxed, not 7 (they don't start at zero, you can tag for +15x3, etc...). You can ignore Barter, Survival (if you're not playing Hardcore), and 3 weapon types you're not using. Maybe ignore Speech, Sneak, Repair, or Medicine if you're not interested in those, they are certainly not necessary to finish the game. You should have plenty of Skill points to mess around and max whatever you feel like.

**General Gameplay Tips**

* **Pick up 3 scrap metal, 2 sensor modules, and 1 scrap electronics as soon as possible.** Use these to get your first companion, ED-E the eyebot, as soon as you enter the town of Primm (probably the first town you'll enter after you leave Goodsprings). It does a LOT of damage and will save you a lot of ammo / money in the early game. It also doesn't count against your ""real"" companion slot, won't leave you over any decision you make, and acts as a portable science workbench / ammo crafting bench if you own the Lonesome Road expansion (this may be a bug, but it works). *YOU DO* **NOT** *NEED SCIENCE OR REPAIR SKILL TO REPAIR ED-E BY THIS METHOD.*

* **Pick up every antivenom you find**, because Cazadors poison you every time they hit you, and you can't sleep while poisoned. Basically try to win fights with them, then use an antivenom after the fight is over, or they'll just repoison you immediately. It is kind of annoying, and you'll run into a lot of Cazadors in the wild if you're exploring and trying to find every location. An easy source of antivenom is killing Caesar's Legion assassins that will come after you if you piss that faction off. They will often carry it, as well as valueable weapons you can sell for lots of caps (at level 20 every assassin squad that comes for me has a Super Sledge and other good weapons).

* **Pick up and keep at least 1 easily concealed ""holdout"" weapon** because there are a few times they will come in handy. The silenced 22 pistol doesn't even require 50 Sneak to keep on you, and you can use it to kill a certain asshole you have unfinished business with, without alerting the other Chairmen in The Tops casino (this is not your only chance, though, just your earliest). Switchblades, knuckles, etc... can be concealed without 50 Sneak skill, and most melee weapons are silent, just try to get the person you want dead in a place where others can't see you. If you're using a silent ranged weapon though, you're the only one who doesn't need to be seen. You can check this by ""sneaking"" and seeing if it says ""hidden"" (fire away) or ""detected"" (they see you do it, so silence doesn't matter).

* **If you have more than 6 Luck it is pretty easy to clean out all 3 casinos** in New Vegas. It will net you around 30k-48k depending on how you do it, but I don't recommend building your character for this (48k caps isn't a huge sum by level 20). You can make thousands selling weapons you find. If you CAN take advantage of this though, buy all of your implants as soon as you get to The Strip. If you're roleplaying a lucky guy, or just want the maximum possible base critical hit rate (1% per point of Luck), go hog wild.",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,1344982724.0,,,True,t3_y6d37,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/y6d37/new_to_vegas_read_this_character_build_new_player/,

I felt like everything developed sooo slow and the wasteland kind of bored me. Thankfully I listened to my firends and after a few hours of game play I of course became addicted and it is probably one of my favorite games. I talked one of my friends who has played about 10 play throughs on Skyrim into getting FNV and he sold it after a week saying it wasn't Skyrim and I couldn't convince him how great the stories were. He said the wasteland was just boring to him. He didn't give it long enough I dont think and I have actually heard a lot of people (including those who are fallout fanatics) say that FNV is really slow at first.

I killed and ate every major character and person i came in contact with. I killed and ate every member of the Brotherhood of Steel, including Veronica. I actually killed and ate every human companion and Raoul, but I couldn't eat ED-E or The dog so I just killed them. I failed every quest except for the ones for Yes man.

Basically I killed and ate a lot of shit. edit:1337 bodies

I did it all wearing only Breezes nude erection armor and various hats.

I only used knives and revolvers.

The ending is funny.... no one was ""a match for the courier"" haha

So, for your initial hand you will be given 8 of the cards out of their deck, and the only cards you can lay down are either 2-10 or an ace. Typically a good strategy is to lay either your highest or lowest cards down first. (I typically start with highest because more points means you're closer to your 21-26 winning number.) After both players have laid down their first cards for each of their three Caravans, the game is ready to go.

**Numerical Direction**

As stated in game, the second card laid down in each individual Caravan determines your ""numerical direction."" What this really means is whether or not your cards will go in ascending or descending order. (Descending being much like Solitaire, if you're still not quite getting it.) The difference between Caravan and Solitaire is that Unlike Solitaire, Caravans cards do not need to be in order, but rather any number can be laid onto another if it agrees with the numeric direction.

I.E. Caravan is a 2, then a 3, then a 5, giving a total of 10. Once you have laid down the 5, you may then lay down any number *BIGGER* than 5, but you cannot lay down another 5.

It is also worth noting the suits of your cards because it is possible to play a same-suited card regardless of numeric direction.

**Face Cards/Jokers**

Face cards work a little differently than the basic cards, each having it's own special property.

Jacks: Jacks get rid of any card you lay it on. Good for getting rid of cards laid in bad spots or ones that would otherwise make it impossible to lay a card down without going over the 27-point limit.

Queens: Queens change the numeric direction of any Caravan it is placed on. For instance: You need one caravan to win, and the Caravan consists of a 8,5, and 3, making a total of 16 and making your direction descending. In your hand you have all cards higher than a 3 and one queen. If you place the queen on the 3 in this Caravan, any number now BIGGER than 3 can be used, instead of smaller.

Kings: Kings have the most practical and straight-forward use. Any card you play a King on will add the value of the card it is placed on. Lets say your caravan starts with a 10, then you play a 6 onto it. After that, you may place the King on either the 10 or the 6 (you can play the King on ANY card in ANY Caravan) which will make your Caravan go up in points to either 22 or 26, 26 obviously being more desirable.

Jokers: Jokers are sneaky cards. They have two different uses, depending on the card they are played on.
If played on an ACE: If you play your Joker on an ace, it will get rid of all cards of the corresponding suit of that ace.
If played on a card 2-10: If you play a Joker on a card 2-10, the Joker will get rid of all cards of the same value. (I.E. all 3, 2,7, ect.)

Keep in mind: **ALL FACE CARDS CAN BE USED ON YOUR OPPONENTS CARAVANS AS WELL** Keeping this in mind can save you from sure defeat. Sending your opponent over the 26 point limit making him/her restart their Caravan can be a devastating tactic, and should not be underestimated. Getting rid of high-point cards with Jacks can also be hard to deal with, as well.",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,False,,,True,t3_duj67,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/duj67/how_to_play_caravan/,

That seemingly rich and powerful person is not what they appear at face value, although their influence is undeniable (Jeffrey Lebowski AKA The Big Lebowski = Mr. House. Lebowski has no actual money of his own, House is a living husk playing puppet master)

A close friend of the protagonist is an irate war veteran who can't let go of his wife (Walter Sobchak = Boone)

In the first scene, the protagonist is attacked by the goons of a shady, powerful, and kind of sleazy villain (Jackie Treehorn and his thugs = Benny and the Great Khans)

The protagonist is often beset by a group of invasive psychopaths who weren't always affiliated under their current banner (The Nihilists = Caesars Legion. The Nihilists used to be in an industrial band, the Legion is comprised of conquered tribes and slaves)

Although sometimes aided by the local authorities, the protagonist is never fully reliant on them nor does he place any trust in them (The Police = NCR. The cops in TBL are never that useful. They do manage to find the Dude's car but without the briefcase. When Dude asks about leads, the Cop laughs and blows him off. The NCR will come to your aid from time to time if you are friendly with them, but are not all just nor are they reliable. The cops in Malibu don't even listen to Dude's story, they beat him and throw him back on the streets after realizing he's a nobody)

I was just curious as to what you thought would be good locations for future games.  I have come up with a few:

NYC - Only urban (minus central park) which might get a bit boring but it could still be cool.  If it was only NYC the map might feel a bit small or cramped.  If they expanded the area to be more of the [Eastern](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/New_York) or [New England](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Massachusetts) commonwealths they could include/expand on the story behind [the Institute.](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Institute)


[Europe](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Europe) - There is little mention of what is going on in Europe so this could be a cool place to expand.  Perhaps start in mainland Europe and allow the player to explore and/or travel to the UK.  This would allow for a huge map.


Asia - I mostly had Japan/[China](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/China) in mind for this but other parts of SE Asia could be included.  It would be cool to see how the US's enemy has survived since the war.  Could also allow for a huge map.


[Chicago](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Chicago) - Fairly new area story wise, could allow for a good mix of urban/rural if they included the outlying area.  It could be a story focused on the Enclave, Midwest Brotherhood and super mutants.


[The Core Region](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Core_Region) - Depending on how big of an area the new engine allows for they could make a game that includes most/all of the core region from Fallout1/2/New Vegas.  It would be interesting to see how the stories from all of those areas could tie together.


[Canada](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Canada)

Movement is impossible, the ""jump"" button doesn't make me jump, and it seems like there's no way to escape except to reload a previous game.

What you do is this:

Drop a large item from your inventory (armor/clothing works best).  Be sure to drop it under you or near enough to reach with the ""Grab"" command.  If you have to grab it, put it under you so you can stand on it.

Now, since you're standing on your item instead of the terrain, you can walk and jump again!  Take the item you used to escape and carry on as you were before the bug.

Figuring this out was very cathartic after all the frustrating bugs in these otherwise fine games.

I have used this method twice.

I like the Hunting rifle, scoped or not, because i feel it embodies the scrappy wasteland hunting, and survival. It shows signs of repair, jurryrigging, and can still work after 200 years of the harshest use.

The R-91 looks sexy, expecialy the Alloy steel variant.

N99 alloy variant. Looks sexy as fuck.

Hunting shotgun, gun feels, and looks, like a powerfull weapon.

Power Fist, Great power armor supplement

Balistic fist, ITS A MOTHER FUCKING SHOTGUN GLOVE!!!1!!1-!!!4!!

------------------
Now least favorites

Thermatic lance, looks silly

.22 silenced, just is useless

Varmit rifle, feels strange chambered in 5.56 or .223

K9000, wtf is with the dog noises and ears, its a gun, not a dog. stupid think tank.

Pool cue, how hard is it to make a nail board, be creative, i mean... come on!

grenade machinegun, shoots like a floppy dick

Recharger pistol, Its got high damage for something that breeds its own ammo!

cowboy repeater, Sights are like looking through a persons ass

Browning High Power/Maria, Just feels like a wanna be M1911 to me

Then it hit me, ""Melee doesn't suck in FNV... let's do this!""
Long Story Short: I built myself an Axe Cop playthrough where the only thing I'm using is the fire axe. Sinking all pts into melee and unarmed. 
This is the most fun I've had in the game yet!

&gt; Legion is by far the least frequently selected ending. I think this is due to the rampant misogyny presented by rank-and-file legionaries, the lack of a Legion-oriented companion, and the small number of Legion-oriented locations.

In fact, [a Legion-only companion was planned](http://www.formspring.me/JESawyer/q/322608927730578339)...

&gt; Ulysses was originally intended to be a Legion-oriented companion in the core game.

1372541648.0,24,self.fnv,1hbx18,Power Brawler | Build Guide,Ganrao,29,5,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/1hbx18/power_brawler_build_guide/,"The **Power Brawler** is an experimental build I'm working on right now. It can do incredible damage with Melee or Unarmed skill, and is unmatched for toughness.

------------------------------------------------------------

Building a Power Brawler is a great idea if you want to play Hardcore mode, especially with JSawyer's mod (reduces player HP substantially, reduces player carried weight limit, lowers max level to 35 even w/ all DLC). A Power Brawler focuses on high Endurance to compensate for the decreased effectiveness of Stimpacks and lower max hp, and Strength with either Melee or Unarmed as a primary weapon to alleviate the harsher weight restrictions (even without J Sawyer's, ammo has weight in hardcore mode). 

Key concepts of the Power Brawler are:

* Use T-51b Power Armor w/ Helmet for maximum protection
* Use VATS to teleport into close range, take less damage, AND do double damage to enemies :D
* Be strong enough to blow away everything with a Minigun if necessary ;)

In combat you will want to use VATS to take out the biggest threats first, and you can specialize in either Melee or Unarmed (your preference). Unarmed gets access to a bunch of cool special attacks in VATS so that is my pick, but Bumper Swords are pretty awesome too. When you run out of Action Points or if you're just facing down a large group of weenies, you might want to unload with the biggest Guns type weapon you've got just to finish the job / thin out the pack. You CAN go Energy Weapons, but I feel like they work better with a critical hit build, and you're going to have enough Strength to use a Minigun.

If you don't use J Sawyer's Mod this build is still very strong. You will be essentially invincible, and have so many skill points and perks you can also specialize in either Guns or Energy Weapons the same degree as your close combat skills. Look at my Laser Ninja build (work in progress) for suggestions on how to maximize Energy Weapons :D

---------------------------------------

**POWER BRAWLER REQUIRED PERKS**

[Educated](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Educated) - Amazing for all builds

[Toughness](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Toughness) - Get both ranks! Another great Perk for any build, really

[Super Slam](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Slam) - Knocking down enemies you don't kill is almost as good as killing them

[Life Giver](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Life_Giver) - Very helpful in J Sawyer's mod due to reduced max hp from other sources

[Piercing Strike](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Piercing_Strike) - You ignore 15 (!) enemy Damage Threshold (that is a LOT)

[Adamantium Skeleton](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Adamantium_Skeleton) - Very useful in Hardcore

[Action Girl](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Action_Girl) - The best VATS perk for close combat along with GRS

[Grim Reaper's Sprint](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Grim_Reaper%27s_Sprint) - Just hilarious

[Implant GRX](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Implant_GRX) - Free non-addicting turbo

[Thought You Died](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Thought_You_Died) - For positive karma characters

OR

[Ain't Like That Now](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Ain%27t_Like_That_Now) - For negative karma characters

-----------------------------------------------

**POWER BRAWLER OPTIONAL PERKS**

[Plasma Spaz](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Plasma_Spaz) - Improved in J Sawyer's Mod to also give +20% attack speed on Plasma weapons

[Finesse](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Finesse_(perk\)) - 5 Luck worth of crit, gets multiplied by weapons

[Slayer](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Slayer) - Good raw melee DPS boost when out of Action Points

[Rad Absorption](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Rad_Absorption) - 10x more 
effective with J Sawyer's, don't bother without the mod

---------------------------------------

**POWER BRAWLER SPECIAL &amp; SKILLS**

The *minimum* SPECIAL scores (at character creation) to get all of the required Perks and use a Minigun or Bumper Sword are:

8 Strength

8-10 Endurance

4 Intelligence

5-? Agility

You will need to raise Strength via an implant, and wear T-51b Power Armor for another +1 Strength (you want to anyway) to reach 10. 

You can of course implant Endurance and Intelligence if you want to move those points, but getting an implant before reaching level 4 (so you can take the Educated Perk) can be annoying, especially for newer players. Leaving them at 8 and 4 is just more convenient early on, and you may want to consider taking 10 Endurance at creation just to max your hp out for the rest of the game anyway.

Agility needs to get to 6 with an implant for Action Girl, but it is another viable dump stat besides Endurance if you're not using J Sawyer's mod and just can't get enough VATS.

There aren't many (any?) skill requirements outside of 70 in Unarmed (or Melee if using J Sawyer's) to get all the required Perks.

Look up the minimum skill requirements to get the optional perks you want and try to have them ready when the Perk becomes available. Aside from that you are free to customize the rest of your SPECIAL / Skills / Perks however you want. I recommend maxing Lockpick on every character, personally. It helps with finishing quests quickly, getting more money / loot, and general exploring.

**Enjoy! Hope you have as much fun with this build as I do :D**

ps: my personal ""power gaming"" SPECIAL pick at creation for this build is:

8 Strength

1 Perception (ED-E gives max radar range anyway)

9 Endurance

1 Charisma

3 Intelligence (will beat the Casinos to pay for the mod early as possible)

9 Agility (max Action Points!)

9 Luck (+15% Base Critical Hit chance w/ Finesse now, dats a lot!)

I will implant all of these values eventually because I have enough Endurance to do so and also get the health regen and +DT implants.

http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/44629

- Usable bedroll tucked at the top (no ""Well Rested"" however, unless you've got ""Rough'in it"" perk from Lonesome Road.)

- Camping gear stuffed on both sides (cook your own grub wherever you break a camp!)

- 200lbs capacity (but most likely unlimited, due to an in game glitch, but no worries, it also got some drawbacks...)

- Weapon spread increased by 15% (Heavy block of military gear on your shoulders and back WILL make your aim uncomfortably bad, I know that from my own real life experience, period!)

- Makes you move slower by 10% (Yes it will! Certainty backed by the same experience like above, same applies below.)

-Sneak skill reduced by 10.

As long as you don't take advantage of the unlimited weight capacity, this seems like the coolest mod for a survivalist build.

Second coolest bag I found was this: http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34986  Just a beautiful hiking backpack that adds 100lbs capacity, which is realistic for an outdoorsman character.",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,False,,,True,t3_17u0gk,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/17u0gk/the_hardcore_backpack_awesome_mod_for_survivalists/,

So I totally had a Scarface moment. You know that scene where he's supposed to assist the assassin in taking out the guy who's going to talk to the UN. And the assassin is getting ready to blow the guy up but his wife and kid are around and Tony is like ""you kill women and children. fuck you man, you disgusting fuck. I can't do this man. fuck you. FUCK YOU!"" and then he shoots him.

Yeah, same thing happened to me. They started walking off and I was like ""FUCK YOU"" and tossed a few grenades at them. That killed them all except the leader. It took about 20 double shotty blasts to take him down.

1. Playing on Hardcore mode. Vault 13 Canteen doesn't seem to do much? What is it for?

2. Is there any indication of a gun's range? How much farther can my varmint rifle+scope shoot than my 10mm pistol?

3. Are there any permanent storage locations in the game? I'm collecting all sorts of random crap because I don't know what it's for yet, and I'm running out of room. I just sold the conductor I had about 5 minutes before I realized I needed it to fix [the robot in Primm](/spoiler). Bollocks.

4. Where can I find a goddamn science book so I can fix the goddamn [robot in Primm?](/spoiler) ;)

(xpost from /r/Fallout)",lastanswer,27,4,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/m0gxr/suggestions_for_a_better_badder_hardcore_mode_for/,"I love Fallout, and was thrilled to play NV's Hardcore mode. Unfortunately, it didn't feel all that different from playing through normally. I think Beth should continue Hardcore mode in future iterations of the game...here are my ideas (**feel free to comment, add to, or take a big dump on my suggestions**):

1. **Incapacitation.** Allow for an ""incapacitated"" status for companions. They'll still be able to die if they take too much damage (like over 120% of their HP), but at least give us the chance to revive them. Far too often, they spaz out, run off a cliff, get into a fight with five radscorpions, and die before I can rescue them. If you get to them while they are ""incapacitated"", you can revive them using a Doctor's bag.

2. **Fewer containers/storage lockers** (or more w/ the &lt;Empty&gt; tag). I don't know why there are SO. MANY. BOXES. Visiting a school? Time to check out all fifty lockers! I feel like a hoarder w/ 300 lbs of fission batteries playing post-apocalyptic Storage Wars. **edit**: maybe there shouldn't be any less containers, but not so many in the hallways, staircases, and work areas. I think boxes belong in storage areas (like closets, garages, houses, etc.) but that's just me.

3. **Thirsty Mode** I need to get thirstier, hungrier, and sleep deprived more often. Give me a reason to drink water out of a toilet!

4. **Wild Wasteland** Wild Wasteland should not be a perk (i just think everyone should get the jokes).

5. **Crafting Revamp** Make crafting ""fun"". I appreciate the crafting &amp; reloading benches, but seriously, there is so much inventory micro-management just to build, say, 5 rounds of 50MG ammo. Streamline it: if you have X and want to build Y, and you could build Y with the broken down parts of X, then just give me the option to build Y instead of forcing me to go through the whole process It just takes too long and it's not fun.

6. **Stimpacks Logical Placement** Keep the # stimpacks/super stimpacks low and confined to places that make sense, like health kits &amp; doctors' offices.

7. **Poison Status** Let me know on-screen when I'm poisoned. You don't have to make it easier for me to cure myself, but please save me the trouble of checking my Pip-Boy when I'm dying. There's nothing like getting bit by a baby Cazadore and then collapsing a minute later.

8. **Random Encounter - Sleeping** Random encounters while sleeping (this could be fun) out in the open (away from towns or dungeon areas). So, if you're sleeping out in the open, give the player a 5% chance of getting jumped while asleep. The amount of ~~intelligence~~ perception that you have will determine how close the enemies (i.e., the hit squad) can get to you before you wake up. This also encourages players to be smarter about where they sleep.

9. **Dialogue w/ your gun out** You should get a -1 charisma if you don't holster your gun. It just makes no sense that you could walk into the doctor's office with a gatling laser out and have them be cool with that. This also incentives more folks to go unarmed/melee/one-handed (because you can unholster much faster) w/o having to give players crazy advantages like a super-powerful uppercut.

10. **Caravan Delivery Service** Allow me to give caravans some of my stuff (up to 100 lbs?) so they can deliver it to a place of my choosing. I guess you could integrate it with the mailbox system (which was wonky itself) - shrug.

11. **Disarm Player** Unarmed enemies should have a decent chance of disarming you of your weapon (melee and ranged weapons).

12. **Kidnapped** Be able to be kidnapped and robbed. If you are defeated (but not killed - see incapacitated above) you will be stripped of your inventory and caps. When you come to, you'll be in a nearby doctor's office (w/ 100% health), or even worse, a back alley, the railroad tracks, or in a lake w/ very few supplies and minimal health. You'd be notified of the location of your kidnappers on the World map so you can get your stuff back. While inconvenient for the player, this would add another dimension to the gameplay and make it fun to hunt down your kidnappers.

13. **Unwanted intruder** - if you are in neutral territory, waking a neutral NPC while **inside** their own home should automatically initiate combat.

14. **Crippled Head** - if your head becomes crippled (yikes), then you cannot enter VATS until you've fixed it.

15. **new: Health from Stimpacks is Temporary** - since a stimpack is basically an adrenaline shot, it serves to hold you over until you can really patch yourself up. Boosting yourself full of adrenaline shouldn't ""repair"" your body. One way to address this is to make the make the health effect INSTANT but degrade after 5-10 minutes back to what your health was BEFORE you took it, down to a minimum of 1%. This would make things like food, autodocs, &amp; crafting much, much more important.

Also, players should be able to craft bandages/tourniquets from items like Pre-War Business Wear. This should replace how stimpacks work now - (stims should be instant, but health recovered is temporary vs. bandages which are heal over time, but permanent health recovery).",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,True,,,True,t3_m0gxr,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/m0gxr/suggestions_for_a_better_badder_hardcore_mode_for/,

[Pushy](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Pushy)-For close quarters

Sniper Rifle(silenced/carbon)- Having a silenced long range weapon is always useful.

[All American](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/All-American)- My basic weapon, high DPS, ideal for most encounters short to long range.  Cheap and easily attainable ammunition.  


So this last one is my Holy Grail:


I used to use the Anti-Materiel Rifle until I found the [YCS/186](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/YCS/186_Gauss_rifle).


I equip it with Max Charge Microfusion Cells.  It fires 4 cells/shot and 1 Max Charge takes 5 Microfusion Cells to craft.  So essentially it takes 20 MFC for 1 shot but...


YCS/186 + Max Charge MF Cell = 237 DAM/ 754 DPS

If you have  [Rapid Reload](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Rapid_Reload) the DPS is even more.

There aren't many enemies who can last more than 1 blast from the 186.

I find it incredibly difficult to engage larger groups of high level enemies (I'm currently playing through Lonesome Road) with anything other than guns or strong energy weapons.  Even if I have a lot of range between me and the enemy, the slow fire rate and immersion-breaking low damage output of explosives (seriously, how many missiles can you eat before you die?!) often leaves me reloading my weapon like an asshole while my face gets eaten off.  Similarly, even if I manage to sneak up on a group of enemies with melee or unarmed, I can only get one sneak critical off before the entire group realizes I'm there and completely shits on me.  The alternative is cheesing with Stealthboys but I don't think there are enough Stealthboys to get through the whole game like that.  

Conversely, I find guns and energy weapons to *always* be appropriate for any situation.  I can pick off enemies headshot by headshot from far away with, for example, Christine's CoS Silencer Rifle.  If I get rushed, I can switch to one of various burst-damage guns or energy weapons like a shotgun or LAER/Q35.  

Plus, in Hardcore, carrying explosive ammo takes up a ton of weight.  Combined with the fact that something like the Red Glare already has a weight of 20, it makes it very impractical to use in HC.  

There are still plenty of times where I use melee or unarmed if there are only one or two enemies.  But my point is I could just as well use guns or energy weapons.  I can't really think of any case where the opposite is true.  So this makes me wonder if guns and energy weapons are just flat out better.  Maybe the only caveat is that I don't have any perks chosen to make my explosives better.",,False,self,t5_2rzr5,False,,,True,t3_19f9yv,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/19f9yv/explosives_and_unarmedmelee_are_they_just/,

AS for the characters, you can keep playing as the soldier or move on as someone who lives in a vault.
And here are the story's for both.

Vaulter: You start off just almost as you would Fallout 3, but you start as teenager. Eventually, you begin to age, and once you are 21, the Vault starts to have a food crisis. Eventually cannibals start to overcome the entire vault and you must leave the vault. Once you leave ,you must begin your life a a wastelander and much more. You will eventually encounter the soldier and become friends, partners, enemies, or rivals.

Soldier: You wake up around 200 years later only to realize you are now a ghoul. (not a feral one of course.) and that the entire world has been demolished by radiation.

My build is something like:  
 6 Str, 3 End, 5 Perc, 6 Cha, 7 Int, 8 Agil, 5 Luck  
And for lols I picked Light Frame for one of my traits.
  
Here was my day:
  

* Sided with the Goodspringers so I could get Sunny Smiles as a companion.
* Found a 9mm assault rifle and fell in love.  
* Sniped every Powder Ganger I could hit without entering the prison.
* Took 2 hours from game start to finally arrive in Primme.  
* Got EDE.
* Did some quests for the NCR outpost.  
* Found a giant freaking harpoon gun in the middle of a scorpion swarm.
* Had both my arms and legs broken by Legion Hounds in Nipton.
* Only had enough Doctor's Kits to repair legs.
* Couldn't hit the broad side of a barn because of broken arms.  
* Had both legs broken **AGAIN** in a fight with some gunmen.  
* Slowly limped toward Novac with both arms and legs broken.  
* Finally arrived and found the doctor.
* Bought a bed at the inn.
* Collapsed into bed to recover from my massive sleep dep.  

**GLORIOUS.**  

Last time I did this I tried to start a [Let's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxFjyVRkjqs) [Play](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HLzZ3QKYF4) using a similar mix of mods. Didn't end up going anywhere because I needed to find a job. I didn't think it was worth doing this time but I might start another one after this playthrough. I can't get enough of this uber-hardcore stuff.

So I was looking for quests to do for the NCR by visiting some NCR bases. I fast traveled to The Fort, with my companion Boone, mistaking it as a NCR base. After it loads Boone immediately starts going to town on the Legion soldiers. Instead of leaving I say fuck it, and join him on this slaughter. So me and Boone slowly make our way up hill towards Ceaser's tent. I killed legion soldiers left and right and eventually make it to Ceasers tent. Once in there every body starts rushing me through the tent door hole and Boone goes unconscious. With Boone Unconscious and me realizing this has turned into a 1v7 fight, i switch to my Annabelle and and start to firing on them. After killing all of Ceaser's guards and him I loot all their ballistic fist/glove weapons and their armor and sell them. 

Now what I want to know is, by committing this act did I negatively effect my New Vegas experience?

Second was Auggy (short for Augusta), my main playthrough in which I visited every single location and sold all the junk I came across. (I used a huge carryweight rating to save myself hours of labor, yes.) Third (and abandoned, as I went back to Auggy) was a blue-haired gentleman who killed everything he saw. Total genocide run.

Settled on Viva Las Vegas with a trusty Pre-war Hat and Sunglasses. Used console commands to get the suit, since killing the King would be a tragedy.

This mod blew me away. I took screenshots simply because I was in awe at how beautiful things looked, even on the pre-patched horrible D3D9 settings.

A new radio station chock full of tons of lovely lore-friendly music, hosted by a robot who will humourously comment on life in the Mojave from time to time.

There's this mod which changes up some of the music played from in-world radios/speakers (ie casinos) to other, but still lore-friendly music. (Johnny Cash, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Julie London, etc) But doesn't touch the version of the tracks that would play on your pip-boy. Great if you're the kind of person who plays with the radio off and enjoys the ones in-game. You'd be surprised at how much a relief it is to hear something new and how much the old tracks have just become background noise to you. 

http://www.mediafire.com/?dspir27bsy4pua5

This mod adds 650 different posters to the game to liven up and add some colour to vanilla locations. Lore-friendly vintage advertisements, classic movie posters, pin-up girls, and much more!

This mod adds a whole new radio station to your pip-boy with some americana folk and spaghetti western themes. For those that like to roleplay as a cowboy, or just enjoy the western vibe that NV gives off.

You can use both a male, -and- a female, but only one of the males. It only affects damage grunts/breathing for the PC (Great if you're unarmed, there's even a taunt or two in there), but it's a vast improvement over the default.

If you've ever taken the Sandman perk, you've probably heard that little cartoonish xylophone sound playing when you make a kill. This mod has two options for replacing it. You can either remove the sound effect and just hear throat slitting, or you can make it even sillier by having it play the chorus of ""Mister Sandman"" by The Chordettes!

It works surprisingly well, and makes shooting feel much more kinetic - especially for sniping. No more does it feel like a laser. Now it feels like a projectile is actually being shot from the barrel!

The only problem I could find was that certain first person weapons spazzed out and shot the ground. But that was due to the animations being broken by DLC, which was easily fixed.

Fallout : New Vegas is my first game in the Fallout series I've ever played. I had already played Morrowing and Skyrim so I thought I was fairly accustomed with how these games worked.  
I picked it up last week and I'm hooked. The dialogue system is great,  the universe is fantastic and there's so much to explore, it's impressive.  
But I have a few questions (for the record, I'm at level 10 with a caracter focused on INT, AGL, stats mainly aimed towards guns, repair, science, lockpick, speech and perks towards XP gain, VATS precisions and damage threshold augmentation) :  
* Is it normal that I'm having my ass absolutely kicked by some creatures, even if I feel my stats are not that bad ? I'm having troubles going to New Vegas because of giant radscorpions in the west, fuckin' Deathclaws (learned my mistake very, very fast on that one) in the middle and lakelurkers at the east (easy kills but each of their shots took 1/4 of my HP).  
* I don't know what to do with my guns. I'm currently using a 10mm, a 9mm and a cowboy repeater but I'm not sure if that's the best choice, especially against high-defense enemies. Are shotguns a good weapon ?  
* I'm very frustrated by some of the requirements that seem high at my level. I helped the ghouls get in their rockets at the REPCONN facility but couldn't correct their trajectory because my Science skill wasn't enough (55 needed). Is that a normal thing ?  
* Finally, I had the occasion to have Boone at a companion, but I refused. What good are companions ? Are they really useful in combat ? Won't they get me detected more easily ?  
* Finally, do you guys have some recommendations and advices for me ?

I see a bunch of bloatflies and think, ""oh this cave is gonna be EASY"". 

Boy, was I wrong.  I walk up the ledge and see the Legendary Bloatfly just hovering there glowing green.  I start shooting it and realize this thing has a LOT of HP.  I look down and check my health after it shoots a few plasma bursts and notice it barely did anything to me so I keep firing.

Next thing I know, I'm watching my body flop about in slow motion.

(Possible spoilers)",TheDark1,21,3,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/lbzzz/rfnv_what_is_the_worst_mistake_you_have_made/,"Allow me to start. So a few days before the Lonesome Road release I caned my way through Vault 34 for the retarded water pollution side quest. Busted my way into the armory while I was there and picked up everything there. None of it was very impressive.   
  
Cut to Lonesome Road. The message before entering said you can re-enter so I didn't bother trying to pare back my equipment. I ditched a few things but went in pretty heavy.   
  
So I finished the quest and then thought I should try the courier's mile. Goddamn that was difficult. The soldiers there just don't quit, and there are so many deathclaws lurking around. I ended up getting into the ""save every time I kill something"" mentality. Anyway, that is beside the point. I killed the guys and I was astonished at the fine weaponry available. I decided to keep a second thermic lance, the gatling laser, and I was already carrying 2 anti-materiel rifles. I like backups...   
  
So I found a quiet patch in the courier's mile and jettisoned a bunch of stuff. 
  
Next I decided it was time to help Veronica. So the quest about old world tech was initiated. I had already fucked up the C-finder thing (BTW if somebody could explain how to activate that fucking thing, I would appreciate it). I had also destroyed the evidence from Vault 22. Then, I realized that I must have ditched the Pulse gun in the courier's mile! So I went back into the courier's mile, and had to fight my way through again, only to find that the Pulse gun wasn't there!   
  
So that quest is ruined, because the pulse gun is not in any of my stash spots. I don't know what the hell happened to it.

**Veronica still has all the shit I made her carry around like a pack mule.**

Obviously, she *knew* I had forgotten to take back my gratuitous amounts of ammo and alternate clothing, as well as assorted foodstuffs. She was just so damn bitter about being replaced that she pretended not to notice the 200-something pounds of crap she practically stole from me.

So here's my question: where can I find her so I can kick her teeth in and take my loot back (or beg her to come back)?

I feel like I told her to wait for me at the Lucky 38, but she wasn't there. I also checked back at TP 188 to no avail. I'm currently scouring the BoS Bunker but I think she skipped the country on me.

First of all, it's freaking awesome. I've only played HL2 on PC, so I have next to zero gaming experience. Because of this, I'm not sure if I'm playing it correctly. And because I've been lurking here for and notice everyone has different types of ""builds"", I'm making myself worry/overthink. Here's a rundown on my status:

* Downloaded Ultimate Edition which starts me out with weird missions
* 17 hours logged, level 7
* May have accidentally read lockpicking magazines in Goodsprings thinking they were permanent
* Powder Gangers hate me, I hate them back =)
* Skills: Guns 58, Lockpick 54, Science 41, Sneak 41, Speech 33, rest &lt; 20
* S.P.E.C. = 6, I. = 7, A.L. = 5 
* Perks: Educated, intense training, lord death, bug stomp, strong back, swift learner

So some basic questions, I'll *gladly* take **""we're not telling you, find out yourself!""** as your response

* ~~How do I know what magazines I find laying around are permanent skill enhancers? Which are temporary? Only after I was level 4 did I find the [sniper guide](http://seedykiwi.hubpages.com/hub/New-Vegas-Sniper#) but I realize it may be too late with low skills.~~ question was answered, can tell by price/name and checking Wiki. Thanks!

* ~~When I try to sell Lightweight Metal armor to Chet, it says ""VAL 431"" but I'm only offered 227 Caps. What does ""VAL/value"" truly mean? Or is this just a low Barter skill issue?~~ question was answered, barter skill &amp; liked/loved/hated etc. by community

*~~I always find myself going back to Goodsprings for buying/selling, where else can I buy ammo? Many times Chet won't have the type I want, or enough of it. So far other people (Vickie/Vance, NCR Mohave) have only offered me aid/food type things~~ question was answered, continue exploring/searching and I should run into more vendors. Should stop into Novac after exploring the SouthEast

* ~~I realized yesterday all the missions I've been doing are rather minor. Also I figured out ""Dead Money"" and ""Lonesome Road"" are giving me mission lines that I think I'm not ready for yet. Do I just ignore these? Pip-Boy is getting cluttered.~~ Question answered

I am having an issue with a known bug for this mission.  After I initiate the dialog with Ranger Grant and the game skips overnight, I am left standing in the same place, Ranger Grant disappears and I fail the quest.  After that, my character can't move but the world seems to go on around me.  I've tried the bug fix listed below.  Here is the bug and fix copied from the Wikia

""After initiating the dialog where Ranger Grant tells you to get some rest before the President arrives, the game may crash after fading out. (Possible fix) Wait to a certain time (i.e. 10:00 PM) then talk to Ranger Grant to proceed with the quest. (Waiting until 10PM confirmed fix on PC) (Possible fix) Wait multiple one-hour increments. If waiting is disabled, find a bed and sleep in one-hour increments. [verified]""

When I wait or sleep nearby (regardless of length), Ranger pops up in my face and we go through the same song and dance listed above.

Any idea what to do?

Any suggestions?,DJ-Salinger,34,18,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/1bdec5/im_playing_new_vegas_for_the_first_time_and/,"I loved Fallout 3.  I spent probably 150 hours in my first playing through exploring every single thing I could, then after finishing, I immediately started another playthough making the exact opposite choices I did the first time.

I was super excited to start New Vegas (Ultimate Edition) and it just came in the mail about a week ago.

Unfortunately, I'm finding it very difficult to get into.  Some examples:

 - So many things are copied from FO3.  It's very weird for me to recognize textures and set pieces from a previous games.  Even some dialogue filler lines are the same.  It feels like a huge expansion pack to me.

 - I feel like I can't explore as much.  In NV, Trying to get to New Vegas, I got massacred by Deathclaws, and heading out past the cemetery, I got massacred by Cazadors.  In FO3, I did a run all the way to Rivet City to get the Science Bobblehead, without unmanageable difficulty.

 - I realize I'm probably very alone on this, but I really do not like using the iron sights for shooting.

 - I was disappointed to see the the size of the map is actually deceiving.  Although it appears to be a huge square, a large portion on the left and right are unable to be visited.

I really want to like this game, so do you guys have any suggestions?

I know this type of topic comes up from time to time, but I was hoping to get some advice for a character build. I haven't thought of which mods, if any, to install for this playthrough, so for all intents and purposes, this will be for the vanilla game + DLC.

This will be my second playthrough of FNV (with all DLC). On my first playthrough, I went with a jack-of-all-trades type of character, with a focus on science and speech, and ultimately went with the Independent/Yes Man ending. It was heaps of fun, and after a bit of a break, I want to get back into the game.

I've read through the various guides on character builds (like on [GamesRadar](http://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-new-vegas-character-build-guide/)), but nothing really grabs me. 

*Melee*? Not for me. 

*Sniper*? Could be a great deal of fun, though a bit similar to my last playthrough. 

*Heavy Weapons*? Again, not really my style. 

*Laser Gunner* sounds like it could be fun. Same goes for the *Wasteland Negotiator* and *Thief Extraordinaire*. 

In terms of companions, on my first playthrough I stuck with ED-E and Veronica. This time, I'd like to do a playthrough focused around Arcade Gannon, so maybe I should try and create a character based around that.

I guess what it comes down to is that I'd luck to try a character based around the Intelligence statistic. So I throw it open to you, fans of Fallout: New Vegas. What should I focus on? Any skills or weapons I should keep an eye out for?
