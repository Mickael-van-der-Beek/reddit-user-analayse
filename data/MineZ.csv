1343675130.0,291,self.MineZ,xelhu,[SUGGESTION] Why we should be able to spawn on our friends.,ChilledDragon,357,66,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/xelhu/suggestion_why_we_should_be_able_to_spawn_on_our/,"Ok, we've all had those ~~hours~~ moments when you and your buddy/group are trying to gather together to go zed-killing. And time and time again, right before you found the last straggling member, your leader dies and spawns in Romero. And the group is in Grimdale. Fun, right? **WRONG**

I play video games to have fun. While MineZ is sadistically fun, holding W for 30 minutes is not. Now, this has been suggested many times before, but I have some pros about why it would increase the fun factor of MineZ. 

1. It would allow groups of people to get into the fun of MineZ (Giants, the North, dungeons) a lot faster.

2. With the right balancing, it would not become exploitable. I will get back to this in a moment.

3. Spawning on friends would rid the long time of walking from Grimdale to Romero to get to your friend. This, in my opinion, is worse than waiting in line for the server.

Now, you may be asking yourself ""How would this be balanced?"" I have answered this already for you.

1. Players can only use the ability within the first 3 minutes of spawning.

2. You can only spawn on friends if they are within a certain distance near the coast (~200m), and if they just recently spawned (3 min perhaps? To coincide with number 1, but times can change)

3. Instead of simply using /minez spawn HighlifeTTU and spawning on Highlife, which would be exploited to spawn on well known people, the friend that would be the ""spawnpoint"" so to speak would have to accept the request: ""LazerTester would like to spawn on you, accept with /yes or decline with /no"" 

4. Now you may be thinking, ""But won't the well-known people just get spammed with requests?"" One step ahead of you. If LazerTester has already spawned on Highlife, or Lazer left, Highlife can put in the command /requestsoff to disable requests, and then when Lazer wants to spawn on him, he uses /requestson to allow Lazer to send him the request.

5. You wouldn't spawn right onto the recipient, but rather ~200 blocks from them. I say ~200 because I don't know how to balance it.

While this could get instantly shoved away, I would just like to get this off my chest. Or it could get looked at, and even better implemented.

Either way, I'd like to thank the whole development team for reinvigorating the stale survival aspect of Minecraft.

EDIT: Umm, wow. Number 1 in the subreddit ever. I guess planning out a previously shelved suggestion can lead to big things. Thanks for the support, even though the admins are hiding.

EDIT 2: Still no dev response, even a simple ""no"" would suffice.

EDIT 3: I just thought of something right before falling asleep. You may be thinking ""But teleporting doesn't fit with the medieval theme!"" In a zombie apocalypse, my friends would be near me.

1344285599.0,194,self.MineZ,xs9cf,"""I wasn't cheating!""  Why we are confident that you were.",HighlifeTTU,227,33,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/xs9cf/i_wasnt_cheating_why_we_are_confident_that_you/,"The administration for MineZ comes from a background of administrating on a very popular hardcore factions server.  People are constantly trying to find new hacked clients or exploits to give them an unfair advantage.  We are used to this, and we've learned to identify hacks very quickly.  But let me back up a moment and explain something.

One of the things I tell every admin on the team is that no ban should be handed out unless you have 100% confidence.  This is why we won't ban on anything but clear evidence (video proof / clear screen shots), and the vast majority of the bans we make are done manually by the administration team.  In my eyes, a false ban is the worst kind.  I do not want to ban someone on error.  It isn't fun being banned for no reason, and I don't want myself or my team handing out wrongful bans.

But that all being said, a number of you have been banned for ""AutoCrit"" violations.  We setup the auto critical detection to work in a way that even a statistically improbable amount of false flags will not ban you.  Rather, you have to be using some sort of modded client that attempts to automatically critical hit every hit.  People are claiming they didn't cheat, but let me be clear that since so many bans are getting placed on this we have THOROUGHLY tested the detection.  Even under our best efforts, and by creating artificial lag on our connections, we cannot even get close to hitting the auto critical flag limit.  It is, quite frankly, impossible to flag unless you are using a hacked client.  I have never seen it flag, and visually looked at someone and said ""nope, they aren't using it"".  In every single violation, I've watched the user and verified visually that they are using a hacked client.  To further ensure we are making good bans, we test the major hacked clients regularly and either tweak our existing anti-cheat measures or develop new measures to combat things.  Don't think that lazer, Rafiki, and GraphicH are limited only to gameplay style plugin development, they are very good at developing anticheat measures.  We roll out anticheat measures regularly, but we don't make the changes public for obvious reasons.

Now for those of you who are banned from this, this is the risk you took when you felt you needed to use a hacked client on MineZ.  You may have gotten away with it on other servers, but you won't here.  It is only a matter of time before we do catch those using hacked clients.  There is a very clear repeating TIP in game that states that hacked client usage will get you banned.  If you are asking for a ban appeal, consider that the vast majority of players in MineZ play with a legit client.  They are the ones who lose their hard work because a select few decide they can't play fair.  In my eyes this is unacceptable, and the reason we are very strict in our policies and very rarely give a second chance to those users identified to have a hacked client.

In short, if you hack in MineZ you are going to have a bad time.  Even if you don't flag the blatant cheats, we hop from server to server and visually watch people.  We've done this for months prior to MineZ, and we know exactly what lag looks like versus hacked client usage.  On a final note, I'd like to point out that every month or two a huge list of thousands of compromised Minecraft accounts is published to the web.  How do you think those people get their passwords found out?  Not only do you risk getting banned in MineZ, you risk having your Minecraft account compromised.

I'm sure the administration will need to continue to echo this point as more people are caught and banned, but I felt it deserved a post from me explaining why we are so harsh and why we are confident in the bans we make.",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1344285982.0,,developerred format,True,t3_xs9cf,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/xs9cf/i_wasnt_cheating_why_we_are_confident_that_you/,moderator

Please report it to minezsmp@gmail.com. It is much more convincing to receive multiple unrelated reports on a player than to have an entire witchhunt thread with 135+ comments. Thank you for your diligence, unfortunately the tools these children use are developed by dedicated devs whose sole purpose is to skirt around any detection, and REALLY good detection builds mistrust and unease in a community (the autocrits detection). 

---

To you who choose to cheat:

There is no second chance, there is no do-over, there are no special rights and priviledges. You choose to cheat, you choose getting caught, you choose getting banned, and you make that choice yourself.

Cheating here is nothing but a big middle finger to myself and the entire development team, not to mention your fellow players.

1. You are bypassing the rules of the game that we have worked so hard to put in place.

2. You are ruining the experience for other players, who may choose to simply leave and never come back due to your behavior.

3. You are wasting our time. We happen to feel that a player deserves the best investigation before a ban is put in place, so most bans will never be handed out by moderators save for things that are simple and obvious like chat spam and advertising. Because of this I am forced to spend my time making sure that when I type that ban command I mean it.

If you believe in this mod in any way, you will not cheat. To say it is the most fun you have had in a long time in your ban appeal means jack diddly to me and anyone else who will read it. Each cheating player probably deters 10-15 legitimate players who would have had a blast playing MineZ. It literally eats away at the community. It's one thing to have random ass players from some stupid griefing team show up, as that will happen due to the stupidity of humans and we will try our best to prevent such. When you hang out and claim to be a member of this community only to be discovered to be a liar and a cheat, that's a whole new kind of low.

Keep those things in mind.

1364923509.0,127,self.MineZ,1biz55,Introducing the Shotbow XP System,HighlifeTTU,137,10,221,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/1biz55/introducing_the_shotbow_xp_system/,"Hello MineZers,

I'm back from my vacation and even though I enjoyed some R&amp;R the rest of the team was hard at work on our latest feature.  We've been working for a while to find a way to award things to non-premium members while still giving benefits to premium players for supporting the server.  We also wanted to make a fun ""meta game"" in the network, allowing folks to unlock/do cool things by playing our games.  After many hours of brainstorming, we've come up with the Shotbow Network XP system.

**What is it?**

Essentially, you will eventually be able to gain experience points by playing any of the game modes on the network.  You will get experience for killing zombies, shooting other players in Wasted, or slaying the Ghost in Ghostcraft.  This also has the added benefit of allowing us to take your precious XP to discourage behavior, such as team killing in Wasted.  

**What can I do with the points?**

Spend them!  You can spend the points to unlock kits in Ghostcraft, extra ranked matches in SMASH (if you are non-premium), or temporary items on spawn in MineZ.  The idea is that you can play the games any way you like, then pick the bonuses that you want as opposed to what we think you deserve.  We may eventually have lobby items and vanity things, just for those of you who are good at the mode.  Want a Ghostcraft head to wear around Lobby?  Yeah, that'll be possible.

**How does it work?**

It is all web driven.  Our new website is nearly complete, and players will register on the site using their Minecraft name.  Once we've verified your identity, you can begin collecting XP.  Want to unlock a stone sword on spawn in MineZ?  Log into your XP panel and purchase the sword.  Want to get the engineer class in Wasted? You are a couple button clicks away from terrain repairing goodness.

**How does this affect premium and non-premium?**

For non-premium members this is huge.  You can now unlock everything on the network (besides private servers/reserve slots) by playing your favorite games.  For premium folks, you'll earn experience at an accelerated rate.  We feel this is a nice balance.  Since premium folks are helping pay the bills, you'll get unlocks quicker.  But gone are the days of non-premium unable to unlock the better things in the network.  It will still take time, yes, but it will be possible.  We feel this rewards players who can't afford the network but still choose to play our games and (hopefully) tell their friends how much they love us.  For those players who currently have unlocks in MineZ or Ghostcraft, those unlocks will remain unchanged.  For those that don't, you will just need to earn the XP to unlock them once the system rolls live.

Let me stress one thing very quickly.  WE WILL NOT BE TAKING ANY BENEFITS AWAY FROM PREMIUM MEMBERS.  If you have kits unlocked in LMS or Ghostcraft, those will stay unlocked.  

**Wait, so I can earn XP in one game mode and use it in another?**

Yep.  So for instance, lets say you are terrible at MineZ.  The worst.  Tetraporc bad.  But you are quite the cheeky fellow when it comes to playing SMASH.  You can head over to SMASH, rack up some experience, then use it to give yourself some temporary/permanent benefits in MineZ.  

Another perk.  Lets say you are an iron clad warrior in MineZ who has survived for weeks.  When death comes (and you know it will come eventually) you can use the experience you racked up to pick the perks YOU want.  With our current achievement system, you are awarded temporary benefits as you play, but those benefits expire even if you haven't died.  With the new system, achievements will award experience instead and allow you to save up that experience for the day you finally meet your maker.  Feeling lucky? Blow all your experience and really deck yourself out on spawn.  However, if you die you'll know you've got a lot of XP collecting to do to replenish your precious supply.  This also allows us to modify behavior.  You'll earn XP quicker by working together / killing zombies.  Want to grind to that permanent extra water bottle on spawn? Find some buddies in Romero and start dishing out hate to those nasty zombies.

**When does this happen, good sir?**

Why, I'm glad you asked!  We are currently finishing up the system on the web back end, and hope to have it rolled out to a few of the modes in the next couple of weeks. After that, we will go through our remaining games modes and convert it over to the XP system.  So, soon!  If you guys wondered why there have been a lack of Wasted updates lately, its because we've been plugging away at the new website! 

**Feedback**

I am personally very excited for this system.  It opens up a ton of possibilities.  It allows us to reward our long standing non-premium community members while still giving our premium folks an accelerated experience.  On top of that, we want to have fun mini-games on the website that allow you to earn experience even when you aren't in the game.  Bored at the dentist? Whip out your phone and earn some experience.  But please give your thoughts.  This is the result of many hours of brainstorming, and we think we've nailed it.  But we also want to hear your opinion.  So fire away community, we are all ears.

EDIT: I originally wanted to post this on April Fools as to completely confuse you guys, but I got home from my vacation and had about 200 emails.  So I felt it was better to respond to folks than post this.  Maybe next year I can troll you guys.

Most of the ideas and features in MineZ were proposed in the subreddit. Most people on the subreddit are good at the game. They complain about how easy minez is, while hundreds of noobs can hardly escape the death traps that are public server spawn towns. People who camp the north in full iron are the minority, but are the most influential players. The noobs and southerners are the ones with no voice, as the subreddit disagrees with them. When people suggested that zombies should be buffed, they were. The average player can barely survive 3 zombies at once. Buffing zombies and nerfing loot does nothing to the good players. All it does is make it harder for noobs to survive. If you think the game is easy, why don't you see how long you can survive in romero on US1 public without any extra spawn kit items. Any time someone leaves the game because they are butthurt pussies who cant handle a game. The community whines about and kisses the ass of these people who leave the game becuase they cant ""handle clan drama"" If you don't like clans, do something else in minez. Grab a buddy and explore the map. Or maybe help noobs while you are in good gear. Just a thought. I am assuming im going to get downvoted to karma hell but I am prepared for your circle jerk reaction.

It isn't possible to survive by yourself. I know this will get downvoted to hell, but hear me out. I'm not a bandit. Everyone is going to say ""Don't trust any1 lol!!1!11"" But bandits come in group most often up north. I can't win a 5v1. I have in game friends, but they spawn on the other side of the map and eventually getting to me right as I die from bandits. Zombies can be easily solo'd if you have an iron sword and some pots. I can get full iron, and meet a friend in Al Hasa to kill a giant only to be killed by three guys with diamond swords. It's either too easy or too hard. It gets really frustrating wasting time just to die instead of having a good time with friends. This really isn't a zombie apocalypse game. It's a PVP game with a twist and interesting map. 

Thanks to Spud_Kai and littlebigpac for ruining this game for me. To all my friends on US9, good bye. I'm think I'm done.

**Giants** - It's basically impossible to kill these monsters with an insta I healing 2 hearts.

**Dungeons** - Near impossible, due to insta II pots doing 4 hearts in mass combat in dungeons with high amounts of zombies.

**PvP** - Ruins Pvp COMPLETLY, *especially* with the diamond sword buff, a 4 (give or take a little) critical hit kill. 

**Zombies** - Zombies are much faster now, faster than us sprint jumping too. Sure doesn't help with the huge nerf.

**Splashes** - It's not too big, but you don't get *that* feeling when you find a splash II in a chest.

I was having a conversation with FatherPrax in PM a few days ago about stopping player item drops when killed by a zombie and a light bulb went of in my head on something almost related:

---

Right now the equation goes:

Player + Death = Zombie + Player's inventory scattered on the ground.


---

What if I made it

Player + Death = Zombie w/ player's inventory to drop when killed

---

If a zombie has an inventory for a certain amount of time without dying I remove it. This has a few awesome effects:

1. The awesomeness of actually feeling like the player turned into a zombie

2. Cleaning up item drops without artificially scanning and destroying them

3. Giving players a reason to kill zombies because you don't know which ones carry that awesome loot!

4. Removing a motivation to spawn kill because zombies do not spawn  near a spawnpoint, therefore a player who dies there will not spawn a zombie and their drops will be absorbed into the universal entity.

This has been live since last night, just wanted to make you aware of it. Other changes I made last night are:

- Converted whitelist to database, meaning the whitelist is synced between servers

- Converted rank (silver, gold, platinum) to the database so rank is also synced

- Did a little dance of joy when I made a zombie take my inventory

Questions, comments, concerns, post here!

**tl;dr** The zombie that spawns when a player dies inherits their inventory so random death piles are not going to be as common and there will be motivation or hunting zombies as they might have a very valuable inventory from a player.",[Change Log] ,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1341598316.0,changelog,developer format,True,t3_w50qk,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/w50qk/zombies_are_boring_they_said_make_them_drop/,

so ive been banned for using a hacked client (i'm admitting to it) i was trying out Nodus on the zombies (didn't even work well by the way), anyways im asking to be unbanned i wont use a hacked client again. Also you guys should have a sign at the spawn saying ""hacked client=banned"", because i didnt think that the client cheats even worked because i couldnt walk on water, get critical hits or anything, so i didnt bother turning the hacked client off and going back to narmal minecraft... so yeah please unbann me my ign is CaptKnuckles (also this has noting to do with the ban request, but does the site not show my record, i killed 83 zombies (no cheats) and i wanted to brag, but yeah do you need to donate to get records?)

No one is angry, you're just banned. Hopefully you'll think twice before showing up to a server with a hacked client.


- [–] from CaptKnuckles via  /r/MineZ/  sent 2 hours ago

also just as a question, is it if anyone is banned (for any reason) they are banned for good? and if not there should be a link on the site to remove bans, because it took like 10 min to find this reddit page, also i did have fun :P

- [–] to CaptKnuckles from CaptKnuckles via  /r/MineZ/  sent 2 hours ago

all im saying is there should be a sign saying ""no hacked clients"" or something because the hacked client didnt even work (thats why i didnt bother removing it), try downloading one and testing it, there are absolutely no perks them all (besides radar (which is baisically a map, and brightness (that can also be changed in the normal options menu)), so why bann for it?

- [–] to CaptKnuckles sent 2 hours ago

Because you are a cheater.

- [–] to NikiTesla from CaptKnuckles via  /r/MineZ/  sent 2 hours ago

Oh yeah, i found a bug, if your far up north, and you die with chain armor or better, you spawn with it, and you can drop it but no one can pick it up in the spawn room, but i somehow still had it one time when i typed ""/minez spawn"" (they see it too btw)

- [–] from CaptKnuckles via  /r/MineZ/  sent 1 hour ago

you dont get what im saying basically 1. its not really cheating if theres no perks to it 2. you should have some warnings or something, saying that hacked clients get you permabanned 3. cheer up/not be so strict with this kind of stuff your gunna get a stress tumor
also im not really whining or anything, (or im not trying to) its just that its pretty stupid to ban someone for something of which they are unaware it isnt allowed, the whole ban concept just seems sucky, theres no links or anything on the site, and theres not even something on the site that says your going to get permabanned for ""cheating"" + you defiantly shouldnt get permabanned for ""cheating"" because doesnt the server automatically ban you for using a hacked client? instead you should have it so it bans you for a month or something thats so easy to mess up with and fix. (there should at least be a way to get yourself unbanned, also Reddit sucks, you should use minecraft forums or planet minecraft as the contact page, this site is way too confusing)

- [–] to CaptKnuckles from NikiTesla [M]via  /r/MineZ/  sent 1 hour ago

There is a tip that shows every 5 minutes that specifically says that if you use a hacked client you will be banned from every minez server.

- [–] from CaptKnuckles via  /r/MineZ/  sent 1 hour ago

also as an observation you seem very conceited, closed minded, and up-tight (no need to act like this towards people even if they are ""cheaters"", they dont know they are breaking the rules if you dont tell them the rules first.), yup i just dissed you because you are very pompous (all of you are, you are acting like youve got better things to do, your on this blank site skimming threads typing as little as possible, and looking down on everyone.) Also no need to respond, im not going back on this site, its really confusing and ball suckity
-the ""cheater""
 P.S. all honesty: im not aggravated, raging, or anything like that, you guys have just been extremely unhelpful admins/mods/whatever you are (your like the people behind the counters at inner city hospitals).

- [–] to NikiTesla from CaptKnuckles via  /r/MineZ/  sent 1 hour ago

The tips ive seen are- the giant one and kill whoever, server updating, server restarting, get away from the safe zone, and there are better goods up north, i have never once seen a tip saying anything about hacked clients, if i had do you think i would have been using a hacked client? and even if there is, no one reads the tips, they are running from zombies and people (the only way they do read tips is if they go afk in the spawn, and they get kicked for that), it should definatly be on a sign in the spawn, it would help you avoid at least 75% of the people like me, who claim that it is unfair (it is.) to be permabanned for using a hacked client (and it would remove all of the people that rage if you made it a 1 month ban, no acceptions, or contact policy). I dont mind being permabanned, im just stating that how it works now is pretty shitty.

- [–] to CaptKnuckles from CaptKnuckles via  /r/MineZ/  sent 1 hour ago

also im actually signing off now, i was playing mc, so i didnt close this window, goodbye gayboys, and as a lil' hint people would be way less ragey towards you if you didnt have answers like you do now, you should say something like ""its the rules do"", or ""ill see what i can do"" and do nothing, not just put obvious close minded statements like No. or Because you are a cheater. or Nope. Hope you had fun, you're not coming back.
by the way LaserTester put most of those comments, @LaserTester, dude you are a total up-tight douchebag. (probably a morman or something of that sort, most likely very religious or from a very religious household) PSYCHOANALYSED!!!

You showed up to our server with a hacked client.

You expect some soft, cushy answer so you can go on with your day hoping for an unban and we told it to you straight, it is in our legitimate players' best interest to keep players who will not play by the rules out. Your sense of entitlement tells you you deserve a second chance and we shut it down. I know it hurts, hopefully you can learn not to cheat in the future.

---

This is our hardnosed stance on hacking on MineZ in action. We only ban when we are absolutely sure the player is cheating. This is usually the result.

I will say it again: We do not tolerate hacked clients on MineZ. Anytime that I have felt inclined to give a second chance to a hacked client user it has come back to bite me later.

Most of the [BUG] posts have already been answered by devs, but those useful threads have been buried by a flurry of new posts, so people repost, because they can't find the OP.

Most of the [QUESTION] threads (diamond armor, giant spawning, death ban, release date, etc.) have the same problems as the  bug reports: been answered, answer buried.

I've seen so many [SUGGESTION] posts that are extremely similar to each other, that I can't help but wonder if there isn't a better way to submit them.

My suggestion here is simple in theory:

1. Make a dedicated [SUGGESTION] thread, and sticky it to the top of the page, or make a link to it in the right sidebar. People can post all of them in new comment threads and with one centralized location, the builders will probably get more feedback.

2. Make a dedicated [BUG] thread for the same. If devs only have to check the new comments on one thread, rather than search through suggestions and random questions, they will be able to more efficiently fix the issues. Also if people go to the bug thread and see someone has already posted the same problem, they might be able to provide more information and help the devs out that way.

3. I know MineZ has an 'unoffical wiki', but I think it would be nice to get an FAQ thread going, so if people are lost, they can do a quick scroll through the FAQs before posting theirs, and wouldn't have to worry about not finding it by searching due to peoples' vague wording.

1376604895.0,90,self.MineZ,1kg5n7,Unavowed - The Shotbow MMORPG,kensai111,99,9,174,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/1kg5n7/unavowed_the_shotbow_mmorpg/,"Well it appears the cat was let out of the bag that we were working on an MMORPG today albeit it wasn't really a big secret: http://imgur.com/a/HrZ3Z

That said - I know you guys are going to have a lot of questions and are going to be so excited you can't contain yourselves so let me go ahead and answer these questions for you.

Here is what has been determined so far - granted nothing is final and the MMORPG is still a ways off but I'm going to get buried in questions if I don't answer them now.

1. The Name: Unavowed

2. The Map Size: 22,000 x 22,000 .. no I'm not kidding that's 4 times the size of MineZ

3. # of Playable Races: 11 - each one getting a 2000 x 2000 
homeland.

4. # of players at the same time: 10,000 (see the above link to see how)

5. Will you have a system for guilds/clans? Yes.

6. Dungeons, party system? We will have instanced dungeons - so you don't have to worry about a group of people farming the boss all day - you and a group of friends in a party can enter a dungeon and have your own private dungeon to loot.

7. How will weapons work? So any character will be able to pick up and use most of the weapons in the game. So we aren't taking hammers away from spell casters or anything like that. Infact depending on the weapon you hold in your hand decides how it acts. So using the above example - with a staff you might shoot fireballs from the end of your staff .. and then switch to a hammer and then your fireball skill changes and now suddenly instead of shooting fireballs out of the end you can now slam the hammer into the ground creating huge earthquakes that stun enemies or as it slams into the ground ripples fire outwards. Play how you want to - not how other RPG's have forced you to play.

8. Will I be able to have player storage or anything like that? Yes - this is probably the coolest part of the game. So you will be able to purchase land, buy schematics and place down schematics (just like settlements or Wasted) and have your own custom house on your land. You will then be able to purchase additional things like chairs, tables, etc to go inside. So for example - let's say you the player decide you want to start your own bank. You'll actually be able to get a bank outer shell design of a house. Then set up a counter, vault, etc inside and then physically open your door and climb behind the counter and lock it and let people pay you to keep their items for storage. I'm looking at you Platypus! What's that - you want to be a merchant and start your own store? Sure - snap up some land, buy yourself a stand and go travel to the cheaper areas of the map - buy potions for low .. take them to the big city to your shop and sell them to other players for profit. There is nothing stopping you. The sky is the limit on how you run your business or what you do with your land. Are you a 500+ member clan and want a giant clan hall with a unique floor or statue using your symbol - it will all be possible with the Unavowed land system. 

Go anywhere, be anything, control the world - it's yours.

I know you're going to want to see some pictures - so featured here are some screenshots of an old Aslan ruins. The Aslan are a lion based magic race who focus in healing, protection and damage mitigation. Also featured is the beginning underground town for a race called the Sphenondon our lizard based race who use the water to keep their skin moist from the hot desert sun. The Sphenodon harvest cave mushrooms, sell and transfer them for a profit - a necessary component in potion brewing.

First off, we are always adding more servers. MineZ Started closed beta July 1st with one 150 player server. Today is July 30th and we have 24 servers capable of serving 3050 players if filled to capacity. 

I know you public players are eyeing those free spaces on the private servers hungrily, thinking to yourselves ""Why let all those beautiful empty spaces go to waste, we could have more room for the rest of us if we tore it down and made it public"". I understand your logic, but tearing down a private server to make it public does two things:

1. Reduces the number of private servers for those who spent money to get access (some players like playing on a 4 players server...) 

2. Increases the load on the server and the backing database

Our number one priority is making sure we do not sacrifice performance for size, adding a server should not tip the database into an unmanageable number of queries per minute, if it does we also need to upgrade the database (which we have done twice now). We also have to have a few months worth of server costs, that way we ensure MineZ is sustainable. I know it is frustrating for you to deal with constantly full servers, but we are growing as fast as we can without bursting at the seams. We want to add more servers just as much as you want us to, and we are. Keep an eye out for new servers in the future, because we are not slowing down!",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,False,,developer format,True,t3_xeh76,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/xeh76/you_guys_should_just_add_more_servers/,

Anyways, MineZ has been boring for me with the influx of hate I get. I got jumped by the Clique today after setting up a 1v1 with Malen, and their excuse was ""because you're Ikel.""
I mean really? All these things I am showing you just shows how shit the community is. And no I am not doing this for attention, why would I? And to be honest, you fucks don't deserve a final video. I hate to leave on a bad note, but MineZ has become ClanZ. 

And yes, I did play because I wanted admin. That was no secret, but that will never happen. I tried extremely hard for that, but I was not even good enough for that. And for anyone wondering, I am dealing with depression IRL. But anyways, I met a few good people along the way, like Beast2x, Foxace36, Zpapz, Aoife, all the staff, Kiaa, and everyone else I ever played with or liked (sorry if I am leaving you out.) 
Yes I may return for next map, not sure when that is coming though. And yes, I met a few bad people, like all of the Clique besides one or two of them. It sucks that I am leaving on a bad note, but oh well. I hope you guys can find more fun in MineZ than I did in the past few months. It is a great server, but when you have played since June, it gets a bit boring. I will still play other Shotbow games, like HCF and Smash. I will still browse this subreddit, and I most likely won't read the comments on this post. Honestly, I am scared of what people will say about me on here. Oh, and how could I forget? I ""bought my friends"" according to half the Clique. I guess none of you will miss me then. Goodbye guys.

About a week ago, Highlife cast upon the world a diamond sword. A friend of mine, austinsnake1, was fortunate enough to grab the sword before anyone else. However, even among allies he sensed imminent violence. 

In an effort to keep the sword safe, he entrusted the sword to me. I told him that I would be happy to return the sword to him whenever he wanted it, but he insisted I throw it in the volcano so nobody can use the sword for evil purposes. The temptation was too much and I went against my friend's request.

Over the course of six days or so after that, I went all over the world stocking up and helping other players. I traveled with squads of players on expeditions to resupply and secure zombie-infested towns. I met with resistance and violence on occasion, but through a combination of luck and cooperation, I managed to survive for longer than ever.

On the last day of the sword's existance, I went out on a solo expedition to Romero with various potions and powerful weapons and armor. I should have known that it would be my undoing. After essentially clearing out smp1, I switched to smp3 for another round of zombies. The difference was enormous and the numbers were exponentially higher than smp1. 

semaj1011 heard that I wanted to clear Romero and joined me. I don't want to go into great detail, but there was a gap between the outer wall and a roof that my comrade jumped over. Unfortunately, I was barely short and I fell into the biggest horde I'd seen yet. The strength potion I chugged as I fell was useless.

In what I imagine was a legendary effort, semaj was able to slay my zombie and retrieve my sword from the massive horde. He heard of my final goal for the sword and said he would be taking it to the volcano. We stocked up and made the expedition. Along the way, we were joined by two others. 

Our supplies were in good condition at the base of the volcano, but that changed quickly. The uneven terrain and the sheer size of the volcano sapped our stamina at an alarming rate. At the top of the volcano, we were all getting close to death by hunger. The trip to the base of the lava was desperate. There was just enough time to take one final group picture before our sword-bearer jumped into the lava, destroying the sword forever.

However, when I spawned again, our enigmatic fourth member claimed to have retrieved the sword when it ""bounced"" out of the lava. He was the one who didn't jump in and didn't claim to be dying of hunger. Whether this is true or if he survived the return trip is not known to me. I'd like to believe the sword is gone, but it could still be out there...",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,False,,builder,True,t3_wgkd5,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/wgkd5/the_diamond_sword/,

I have no idea what can and can't be done with server side only modding, so apologies if this isn't even technically possible.

I was thinking about a way to level out the playing field with respect to Bandits and thought, what we need is some Bounty Hunters! The problem though is how do you communicate what the bounty is and how do you guarantee it's paid?

So, would it be possible to have a command like:
/minez bounty playername

This would put your currently equipped item or stack up as a bounty on 'playername's head?. When you run the command, the item would be removed from your inventory and held, to be awarded immediately to the next player to kill the person with the bounty on their head.

- If you've been killed, you spawn with nothing of value, so either one of your friends will have to put a decent bounty on for you, or you'll have to bide your time to have your revenge.

- When a bounty is placed on someone, it is broadcast to the server.

- Each player could only have one bounty out on someone else at a time, but each player could have multiple bounties on their own head.

- If you are killed/die, the bounty you have on someone expires and the item is lost.

- Running '/minez bountylist' would show you currently logged in players who have a bounty on their head and what the bounty is (including a percentage value for damage - you'd be pissed if a diamond sword offered up as bounty only had 2 hits left in it)

Think it could actually add a whole new way of playing the game - set yourself up as a bounty hunter and see what loot you can get that way...

Say there is a rare item in the same category as iron shovels where you may receive a wooden shovel. Left clicking on a person would cause them to take no damage, but be hit, as if a snowball had hit the person. This would break the shovel to some extent, and cause one random item to drop from the person you are pickpocketing (I would prefer from the hotbar, but if that is overpowered, from the entire inventory). You could only pickpocket one person one time every 30-60 seconds, to prevent someone from draining an entire inventory. 

This would create a more thriving crime environment in the world. As of right now, there are 3 different ""professions"" you can take hold of in the game: Medic, Survivor, and Bandit. The thief would be able to fit right in between Survivor and Bandit as not being so severe as a murderer, but not a good act either. It would also create the possibility for silent crime, just like real pickpockets. Someone may not notice that suddenly they are missing an item, or may not notice they took ""damage"".

So, what is the one thing missing from minez? Well, the most important thing in a game: Balance. What i mean by that, is if you are a bandit, you are all powerful. You have health pots, iron swords, chain armor and then you just take over a town. The problem with this, is that the people without these insane items are left in the dust. They cant defend themselves, or even go further into the journey. How do we fix this? Unique actives, auras, buffs, and debuffs. I hate when people say this, but please upvote this so the creators see. I receive no karma for a self post and i simply want this game to become even better than it is. 

This is how it would work.

**On Spawn**: On spawn, you are a survivor. You receive the items you do now, and one active buff. The active buff gives you extra strength when being attacked by someone marked as a bandit. This means you can escape from bandits a little bit easier, and actually get to explore. your survivor active is taken away for 7 seconds after eating and drinking, and can be countered by a hero (a new class i suggest below)

**Bandit** You become a bandit after gaining 6 kill stacks. killing a hero, healer, or survivor gains one stack of killing. Killing a bandit removes one stack of killing and adds one stack of heroism. Once you have gained six stacks, you become a bandit. The only way to remove yourself from bandit status is to kill six bandits, removing the six kill stacks. Remember, once you become a bandit, you gain the six stacks until you kill 6 bandits. If you kill one and only have 5 stacks, you are still a bandit. You need to remove all stacks.

**Bandit Buffs**: As a bandit, you receive some active rewards, also known as buffs. Below is a list of the buffs and their description for the bandits.

* Thievery: Upon killing a hero, you automatically gain the items the hero was holding, rather than them turning into a zombie and having to kill the zombie. 

This would bring a new way to play to MineZ. Banditss and heros are opposites. Bandits go at it alone with more suppliess, where as heroes tend to stick with healers and other heroes. 

* Fleeing Death: Upon reaching below 3 hearts, you receive a movement buff that scales with the amount of hearts missing, up to a 1.5x speed boost. 

This could be edited to fit more of a last resort kinda active. The scaling may be a bit low, but thats for you all to decide. 

**Bandit Debuffs**: These are debuffs that you receive for becoming a bandit. This should make it so people actually think before choosing who to be. 

* Loneliness: When out of range from another bandit for 30 seconds, one heart is taken away. This has a 10 minute cooldown and only occurs if above 5 hearts. 

This would force bandits to be near each other at times. Meaning bandits could end up controlling, lets say, grimdale and because all of the bandits are at grimdale, all the heroes and healers are at romero.

* Conscience: Your attacks against lone survivors do half a heart less damage after your first attack. Only applies to a single survivor and is lifted when the survivor is out of range, or dead.  

This makes it that much easier for new players to get started. 

**Heroes**: Heroes are the good guys. Heroes provide protection to survivors and healers. If you see a hero, ask them if you may join them in their journey. Heroes have their name colored blue. To become a hero, you must kill 3 bandits, or have distributed 10 items of food to survivors and healers. You lose hero status and gain bandit status if you kill two healers and a hero. As a hero, you gain 3 buffs and one debuff. 

**Hero Buffs** You, are a hero. You are what has made MineZ a better place for the good, and the inexperienced. As a reward, you gain three buffs to help you on your journey. However, because of the bandits and the state that MineZ has been left in, your choices to come at a cost. 

* Bravery: Gain increased movement speed when near a bandit above 3 hearts. 

This adds a cat and mouse aspect to the heroes and bandits aspect. The bandits gain more movement speed the lower they are, and you gain more the higher they are. This means they need to out-juke you when they are low, and you need to out-damage them when they are high. 

* Pack: When near another hero and healer, your basic attacks against zombies deal one heart more. 

This adds survivability and encourages teaming up, rather than slaying.

* Increased Healing: Healing potions heal for an extra heart. 

This adds the sustain of traveling far and discovering new places. 

**Hero  Debuffs** You may be a good man or woman, but your sacrifice comes at a cost. Becoming a hero takes a lot of food and guts, and once you reach the title of heroism, the hardships don't stop there.

* Weakened Immune System: The risk of becoming infected or severely wounded is increased by 8%. 

This encourages that pack mentality to stay with a healer and another hero.

**Healer**: You are a healer. You have devoted your journey to not surviving, but healing others. For this, you gain no debuffs and two buffs. To become a healer, you must have distributed 4 instant health potions, or used 4 splash potions of healing to heal others. You loose the title of healer if you kill one hero or two survivors. 

**Healer Buffs**: As a healer, you are honored and respected. You have given so much to the survivors and heroes, yet taken very little for yourself. For this, you receive two buffs that greatly help you throughout your journey.

* Health Regeneration: As a healer, you gain half a heart of regeneration every 2 minutes. Will last until at nine hearts. 

This gives healers a great advantage over bandits and heroes. Most people aren't becoming healers because bandits take their potions and kill them. Its time we gave healers something to look forward to. 

* Resistance: Healers take a half heart reduced damage from all bandits and zombies, and have a 10% less chance of becoming infect or severely wounded. 

This makes healers more defensive and gain, give them the sustain they need. 

I feel like with these changes, MineZ could be a lot more fun for everyone and add that extra bit of strategy.

From what I have seen, the idea of Soloing is being pushed lower and lower down the chain. With the new introductions to Wolves, fighting them is nearly impossible alone.

&gt;They are BLOODY hard to fight by yourself. -- Jacsebalon

Strongholds would be nearly, if not impossible to defend by yourself.

Lazer has said previously that Settlements (Strongholds) will require resources, which will require players to go out and gather them. He also states that small Settlements are available, but my question is, if you do go out to gather resources, how will you protect your settlement?

Along side with these tow updates. The Devs have also announced a ""Party"" system that stops members from hitting each other. Simply put that would give bands of players a **HUGE** advantage in an actual fight. (Imagine a 5 V 1, your more likely to hit a teammate than that one player who is running around trying to escape ultimate death. Especially those groups who don't communicate as much.)

So I was wondering, would Solo players (Who have no friends like me D:) ever get ""advantages""? Or will we be forced to play together with random people to survive?

1341934686.0,65,self.MineZ,wby33,Removal of Deathban on Public / Spawn Killing Thoughts,HighlifeTTU,68,3,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/wby33/removal_of_deathban_on_public_spawn_killing/,"=====Public Server Deathban Remove=====

First, I've removed the death ban from the public test server.  I had originally put the death ban in as a means to be fair to the many people trying to play and let others experience MineZ.  I realize though that the death ban feels like a punishment, when it should really be a ""we hope you enjoyed your free play time, try again in five minutes!"".  So rather than have a death ban, right now it kicks you on death.

So when you die, you get kicked.  If you can get right back into the server, you can play right away again.  But if the servers are full, you might have to wait a bit to get in.  At least people are entertained by the ""join the public server lotto"" game.  I mean, trying to get in is more fun than sitting on your hands right?  And maybe you get lucky and get in right away.  There will be more public servers at release but for now I'm going to let this sit on the public server a couple days and get feedback.

=====Mindless PvP=====

There is going to be PvP in the game, and I think it is a very important element.  While we have a PvE server in the works, the core experience of MineZ is built on the threat of both zombies and players.  The issue I see right now is that there is more benefit to killing someone than to working together.  Some things I am looking at:

1. Attacking someone in melee causes sound.  We already have a sound mechanic in game (it is how movement attracts zombies when there isn't a line of sight).  So we just make it so if players engage in combat zombies hear the struggle and come to give free hugs.  This means that if you are someone in Iron and see someone in leather, its a better idea to help the player than bring 5 zombies in on you.  Now obviously this will frustrate some of you guys in iron since leather folks may rush you, you will kill them, then you get swarmed by zombies.  But what on earth are you doing near the coast in iron armor?  Probably noob killing, so you likely deserve it.

2. Work on some more cooperative elements.  I'd like to see a standard health pot give the current three hearts, but if you apply it to someone else (by hitting them with it) you would heal four and a half hearts.  Maybe do the same for a bandage.  Rather than half a heart to yourself, a bandage heals another player for a full heart.  I want elements like this since it encourages people to make better use of their items by a ""if you heal me I'll heal you"" type situation, that may eventually lead to a new friend.  This would also give players a roaming medic play style.  I like that.  Means I can give a ""MEDIC!!"" achievement that gives an extra bandage to you on spawn for using your bandages to heal others.

3. I will put in custom code to spawn a giant when Ojo or Y_ankees kill a player, so that the giant will one hit both of them and kill them immediately.  Best fix ever.

Now, these are just ideas.  I encourage you to share your own.  But try to come up with solutions that don't penalize an individual player.  Instead, we should give incentives to players to band up together and make survival harder if you choose to PvP people or lone wolf it.  Someone playing the game cooperatively should have it easier. PvP may be a necessity at times but there should be increased risks, not direct penalties.",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1341936682.0,,developerred format,True,t3_wby33,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/wby33/removal_of_deathban_on_public_spawn_killing/,moderator

Since I want to support 75 to 100 players per server with perfect performance, we are looking to host these servers on top tier boxes at the best providers we can.  As a thank you to those who show support and help with these costs, we'll be giving the following:

**EDIT: Buycraft is live at [https://minez.buycraft.net](https://minez.buycraft.net)**



**$25 ""Bronze Kick Start"" Package:**

1. Early access starting tonight
2. A special bronze color name in-game, to indicate your early support of the mod.  You will keep this colored name forever.
3. A special ""Bronze Kick Start"" supporter badge on the upcoming achievements page for your player profile, only players helping during this limited released will have this badge.  The badges aren't rolled out yet and may not be in at official release, but we plan to have achievements and badges in within a couple of weeks.
4. A chance to test the game prior to the small death ban coming into play.  In the future, we have decided to use a scaling death ban (starts at 5 minutes, increasing with each death and peaking at one hour).  This means you have no down time between play throughs until we implement the scaling ban this weekend after stress testing.
5. You can provide direct feedback on the mod prior to roll out, possibly influencing it before release.  We are more concerned about a smooth release than pushing this out with glaring bugs or balance issues.
6. A reserved slot on the servers at release.  Since you are helping with server costs, you will have access to the small pool of reserved slots on each server.

**$50 ""Gold Kick Start"" Package**

1. All of the ""Bronze Kick Start"" Package perks, with a gold colored name and gold badge on your player profile.
2. A ruin or other location with a MineZ themed nod to you via a sign.  This will be in every instance of the map, and every player who joins MineZ will get to see this.  

**$100 ""Platinum Kick Start"" Package**

1. All of the ""Gold Kick Start"" Package perks, with a platinum colored name and platinum badge on your player profile.
2. A shop in one of the major towns will be named for you.
3. Access to the future beta server that will allow you to test and give input on items post release.  Consider this a way to become as close to a designer for the game as possible.  Since you are in the actual beta server, you can give critical feedback on upcoming elements, shape new features, and make demands for certain themed locations that you personally want to see.  

I will add these packages this evening, and access to the server will be instant upon providing support.  We will be releasing this as soon as we can.  This is meant to allow folks a chance to get early entry and some other perks as a ""thank you"" for helping us with the initial server cost outlay.

We are getting very close guys!!  Get excited.

This would make it so players would have to use a lock pick to open some doors that a button could not. How would it work?

Players would scavenge tool chest for lock picks

Lock picks would be Bone renamed lock pick (it doesn't have to be a bone you get the point)

Once players have found a lock pick the would be able to use it on certain doors that are set to be locked doors.

They would have a 50% chance of opening it and a 50% chance of the lock pick breaking. (Again the percentages could be different you get the point)

This would make it so that certain doors that the admins don't want players using a button on they could make it more difficult for the players to get in.

Notes: The lock pick would only work on certain doors the admins set. The player would right click the door with the lock pick and in chat it would display to that player [This door has no lock/Unlocking door/This lock is to complicated.] After they right click if it displayed Unlocking door a couple seconds later it would either say [Opened lock] and the door would swing open for a minute or two or it would say [lock pick broke] and delete the lock pick from the players inventory. If a player scrolled to a new item or dropped the lock pick in between it saying Unlocking door and door unlocked/lock pick broke it would stop the process. 

Please leave a comment telling me your thoughts and suggestions thanks!

This is the single largest update to the MineZ Map since its inception roughly 5 months ago.  The map *no longer uses the Google Maps API* which was too slow and not open-source -- instead, it now uses [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), an open-source JS library that is blazingly fast compared to GMaps.  As a result, virtually **everything** has been recoded from scratch, including the Overviewer core and interface.  

This iteration has undergone substantial testing this past week, and I believe it is now ready for public use.  I've listed the key features below, please browse the [imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/j2inY#0) for more details and images.

**Update:** All IE9 issues fixed, and *most* IE8-6 compatibility issues fixed. If you use IE, but don't use IE10, please download a modern web browser such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/).

As of now the new player zombie instantly despawns if no one is around the area.

This greatly diminishes the surprise element of the game. 8 months ago, in the golden ages of Minez, my friends and I would always kill zombies because there was always a chance for them to drop full iron from a perished adventurer or vast amounts of much needed food from an unlucky traveler.

I remember I won the lottery when I killed a zombie below the spire and it dropped a fresh set of iron from the rewards above. I was laughing my ass off because I knew that he must of fell off climbing down the spire. If it was the player zombie mechanics used today the zombie would of just despawn because no one is around the area. No one would have a chance to know of that brave adventurer's story.

If you increase the time player zombies live it will add to the wow factor of Minez. I can not think of a way for this to be abused since you can only make it to the starting towns with the limited time your player zombie will live. It will be like finding a diamond sword in a haystack, but with orgasmic results.

Going on long lives, getting diamond swords, banditing, exploring, healing, pretty much everything. However I have noticed this game is going down hill. First it was changing my beloved spire, pulling zombies, zombies dealing more damage, changing Thieves Guild to spawn less iron (Fine with me), Hell's Tree with spawners and less iron, zombie pigmen (Also fine with me), and now Al Hasa with one health pot chest.

What is with all this fuckery? I can't stand it anymore and am at the verge of quiting. The game is a challenge for beginners and now you make it more challenging. The game was fine. With the harder north  now, all I want to do is go bandit the south rather than wasting time going north... 

If you are going to make this eventual end game stuff, it's going to be almost impossible, due to the fact that it would take for ever to get iron, d swords, pots, food, etc... Which after acquiring said items, you would then have to complete harder challenges?

**TL;DR** If it ain't broke don't fix it.

Please add some in!",Hysix,62,5,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/wju99/wood_doors_higher_scares_please_add_some_in/,"Wood doors and zombies bashing on them is a fairly frightening experience. It's enough to give sometimes even the veterans goosebumps when they finally break through.

So far I've seen 2 wood doors. They were in an upstairs part of a Romero building a zombie would never make it to. So here's a suggestion.

Make some more buildings have wood doors instead of cobwebs. Still allow zombies to break open these doors, but instead of the doors dropping the hinges simply break and the door opens up. The hinges would work again after repairing the door (right click with something) or simply overtime. If a player tried to shut a door while it was broken a message would inform the player the door has been smashed.

In city environments this would greatly increase the atmosphere of the situation, and I think in general would add to the gameplay experience. Right now it just seems odd to me that almost every door in the world is missing if it was made of wood. Couldn't hurt to try!

(if you still think wood doors are a bad idea, make it so that zombies are attracted to the sound of other dead banging away on them.

As all ideas do, it started with a need. IMO, we need a benefit for zombie hunting. we need to eradicate the zombies in order to return the world to its normal state(y'know, roleplaying) and right now, shifting past zombies is what most players are doing, and, although its smart, its kinda boring. so we need to implement a benefit to zombie killing. 

Now here comes my super crazy, but interesting idea. On spawn, you're given a book. though you can't read it. I dont know if this is codeable, but how cool would it be that if you right click it, the GUI for the beacon interface pops up and you can spend your zombie kills on stat bonuses(maybe limited times, maye unlimited, Idk!), instead of spending iron, or diamonds, etc. or if thats impossible to code, you could type in a command into chat like /cash zombiekills and it would give you a certain amount of diamonds(because people have emeralds as rares, and iron ingots are found in chests) and you would spend those diamonds(they'd also have to block diamond tool/armor crafting). And i'm not talking like 10 zombie kills per diamond, i'm thinking more on the lines of 500 per. And The beacon affect would only affect you, and maybe any friends within 5 blocks of you, or something. Also, the diamonds could be tradeable/droppable and used as currency.

 Obviously, this would need a lot of tweaking such as the removal of regeneration(OP), etc. but i think it could turn into something mighty.

and if the whole beacon interface isnt possible, it could all be chat command based, i just think that this would be something cool to have.

There has been a lot of crying about clans lately, so I decided it was time you cried about something else.  Zombies have been buffed slightly this morning.  Changes below:

1. Towns will now spawn zombies more aggressively.
2. Zombie reach has been tweaked VERY slightly.  I mean VERY slightly.  This shouldn't change a ton, but they are going to be a little bit better hitting you.  When I cut their long arms down, I think I cut them down a bit too much.
3. I've upped the maximum horde size from 5 to 15.  Now, there is a 1% chance a horde will spawn with up to 15 zombies.  This will add a few more surprises to your normal town raiding process.
4. Natural zombie spawning turned back on at night.  Previously, we had to disable this due to bukkit issue with mob spawning.  The bug caused us to see thousands of zombies spawning if we enabled it.  To alleviate this, we hijacked animal spawns instead.  The issue with this was that it meant desert areas never spawned zombies (no animals spawn in the desert) and at night it was safer than during the day, which makes little sense.  So, now zombies spawn at night again.  I did, however, tweak the server to spawn these less often.  In a normal MC server you see monster spawns calculated every 1 tick.  So 20 times a second mobs are calculated to spawn.  I moved this to once every couple of minutes.  This means zombies won't constantly be spawning around you, but will show up more often in the forest.  

With this change the zombie to player ratio has gone from 2:1 to 4:1/5:1.

1374109605.0,58,self.MineZ,1iizl7,MineZ with guns is approaching...,HighlifeTTU,64,6,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/1iizl7/minez_with_guns_is_approaching/,"MineZ with guns (working title) is nearing.  We finally have the map in good shape and the build team will begin a build blitz soon.  The great thing is this can be a ""living map"" in the fact we can release an alpha of it and continue to build while players are testing it.  I am hoping to have something to you guys for initial testing very soon.

But that being said, if people enjoy the mode we've considered making some significant changes to the gameplay to make it a bit interesting.

1. Change of Thirst Mechanic.  Rather than have thirst kill you out right, which is likely a major downer for new players and a pain for our veterans, running out of water would simply reduce the number of hearts available.  So you would have a max health of 5 full hearts versus 10 full hearts.

2. Change of Disease Mechanic.  Along the same lines as thirst, players with disease would not die but rather would see a reduction in total health.  Example, you'd lose three full hearts of maximum health.

3. Horses.  Yes, we'd like to take the horses from Wasted and slap them into GunZ.  A few changes considered would be a requirement of keeping the horse fed for it to continue to move, making them more rare / needing repair, and making them have server specific persistence so people can call a server home.

4. Zombie numbers / damage.  You've got guns.  Come on now.  You think I'm going to give you a shotgun and not increase the zombie count greatly?  However, I will likely decrease the damage to make it so that its more of a ""horde feel"".

5. Balanced armor types.  I really like the idea of shaking up armor.  One of these would be pros/cons to each armor type with the ability to outfit them.  Since guns do a ton of damage and head shots count, the difference between leather and iron will be much more narrow.  So I'm considering having leather give a speed bonus, iron lose the ability to sprint (zombies can catch you), and chain be an in between.  Something along those lines so armor choices come down to preference.  Guns would still be a big deal.  This is the most ""iffy"" thing here, but the suggestion below is a for sure thing I want.

6. Modifiable weapons / armor.  We would start with armor, but I like the idea of re-purposing some of our Settlements resource node code to allow players to go to various mines around the map, gather up resources, and craft ceramic plates / others things using a crafting table.  The idea is that you can find your awesome iron armor (Kevlar), but then you'll want to craft some ceramic plates to beef it up.  This would give you additional armor.  Or possibly giving you the ability to apply a backpack to the armor piece and have extra carry space.  Or maybe some attachment that gives you extra health versus armor.  The sky is the limit, but it would bring back some vanilla resource gathering/crafting mechanics to the game.  Jet pack attachment anyone?  Oxygen tank for more underwater fun?  Modify your grapple hook to be a firing hook that brings you to places / brings people to you ala Annihilation?  Yup, good stuff here.

7.  Make giants faster.  Yep.  You got guns now, no way I'm letting you farm that giant like you used to.  Better bring a team.

8. World destruction.  I mean why not.  We would use the SMASH regen, but I think world destruction should be in.  Zombies got you down?  Blow up the skyscraper near them and watch the falling destruction crush their little undead bodies.

These are just thoughts, but all of them can become a reality if people end up liking MineZ with guns.  It opens up some new things since the game mode will be faster paced and less forgiving.  Anyways, I wanted to stir the pot a bit and see what you guys thought of these ideas.

I spawned near the town of Grimdale, and quickly hooked up with a friend (Snook) together we entered the town in search of medical supplies, food, and some armor. The town was teaming with newcomers quickly consuming resources. The occasional fight broke out scattering supplies over the streets. We heard rumors of better weapons and health potions in the church, we quickly located the entrance and headed into the basement, swords drawn, eyes watching for nametags in the dark. Suddenly everything went red and I herd the distinct crack of a sword break against my character. AMBUSH! We had been lured into a trap. My sense disoriented I wildly swung my sword in the dark. Shockingly I connected with my target, my vision cleared and I went in for the kill. The battle lasted seconds but, seemed like an eternity. I was bleeding and badly wounded, we quickly grabbed the gear of the fallen enemy and head to the center of town. There we split the gear between us. 


**(Yawpton)** Full leather armor, a stone sword, a bow, 30 arrows, health potions and 16 cookies. We were ready. Under the cover of darkness we slipped out the east hole in the Grimdale wall and followed the river north to Yawpton. The town was overrun by looters and bandits. Lawless, is the only way to describe this small town just south of the Z-Line. With our swords at the ready we entered the west gate and quickly ducked into the building to the south to avoid detection. My mate Snook entered the building sword drawn, in case we were to fall under attack. Theres a zombie just inside the door, the loud groan alerts Snook to the present danger, he swings around and deals a deathly blow with his stone sword. The Zombie explodes in a shower of loot. We spend another 30mins in Yawpton scavenging for loot and defending off bandit attacks, before heading north. 


**(The Z-Line)** At this point we have a accumulated the necessary gear to make bandits think twice about attacking us. Wearing Full Chain Mail, wheedling iron swords and enchanted bows we head to a remote part of the woods in search of the Zombie Scum that plagues the earth. Just ahead we can see the Z-line, a distinct change in terrain colour alerts us to the ever present danger of zombie hoards. Suddenly we hear groans and foot steps the consol alerts us to someone nearby. A man in full chain is in a dead sprint headed right for us. We draw our bows and ready the arrows. Both arrows leave the bows and seem to fly in slow motion towards their targets. They pass meer inches from the players helmet and connect with the target. The Zombie chasing him fall to the ground and disappear. Bliss (his tag) quickly flashes the friendly defense signal and we drop our bows. We've made a friend and what would be the beginning of our army... 


**(The Murder of Yawpton)** Low on food Snook, Bliss and I decide to head to Yawpton to scrounge up what little food we can and repair our armor. We talked about recruiting more players but it was just a thought at the moment. None of us could be prepared for what would come next. Yawptown was teeming with newcomers the majority of who were clad in leather armor and stone swords. Our presence was quickly noticed as we entered the North gate of the city. The was an air about this place. Everyone was on edge as the 3 Chain and Iron clad travelers entered the town. We decided to head up the tower to consolidate and exchange some supplies where it was private and the risk of theft was minimal. Bliss decided to guard the entrance and alert us to anyone coming up the ladder. Snook and I combined the food and weapons then split it 3 ways. Just as I was storing the spare set of Chain Mail it happens. *Bliss was MURDERED by DeathMouse*. Time Slows as the realization sank it we had lost our partner. 


**(The Town Rallies)** The lawlessness of Yawpton had gone on for to long. It was time to put and end to this and avenge the death of bliss. Our heads cleared and we knew what needed to be done. Snook sent a message calling out DeathMouse. Snook: ""DeathMouse you have made a grave error by killing Bliss""  I followed this up with a message offering a reward of armor and weapons for the death of DeathMouse. The town erupted into a furry messages were popping up accepting the challenge. In less than a minute Konos had killed DeathMouse and come to the Fountian to claim his reward. We were 3 again. The town was in a bit of shock within a matter of 10 minutes we had made an example of would happen if you murdered while we were there. Comments started popping up ""This is what we need! Law and Order!"" ""Who's in charge?"" ""Where can I sign up to guard the town"". Without hesitation we decided to take command of the people. They were looking for a leader and we were going to accept the challenge of governing a once lawless town. We sent a message out saying that there are 2 rules no unjust killing and to guard and defend your fellow man from the zombie and bandit scum that wanted our land. 


**(The Army Rises)**  A few hours had passed since our band of three had assumed leadership of Yawpton. It was going better than expected newcomers were flooding into the town at an unprecedented rate. Rumor had spread that Yawpton was safe and that our men would protect you. The three of us made up an informal ruling council. We appointed two sheriffs with two deputies each to enforce the no killing rule. We placed sentries at each gate and assigned small 3 man patrols to scour the woods for possible bandits and to keep the zombies north of the Z-line. In total the count was 30 citizens. 10 in full chain with iron swords who were the unofficial army. We were amazingly well coordinated and organized. Snook commanded his own personal 3 man squad who were armed to the teeth and amazing PVPer's. Koss also had his own 4 man squad with 2 archers a healer and a full armored swords man. Snook headed north with his team to acquire more supplies and Koss headed south to recruit more men for our ranks.


**(The Challenger)** As more people migrated into the town there was confusion about how the law worked. I will admit we were all on a bit of a power trip. Arming people to the teeth providing them with food and having them give you their allegiance will go to one's head rather quickly. A small group of lightly armed individuals showed up about 3 hours into our small fiefdoms existence. The guards greeted them with the usual pleasantry 2 cookies and an apple for each travler and a verbal recognition to the law no murder. This did not sit well with this band of travelers. I noticed the hostile tone of the comments from their ""leader"" I summoned my two sheriffs and made our way to the gate. He demanded to know why I thought I was in charge and that he would kill whoever he saw. He demanded a fight. So we gave him a fight that the town would remember. We squared up in the town center Stone vs Iron. I drew my sword and moved to attack. A miss and he lands a blow. I strike, he moves to back away, and I strike again. Our swords clash and we both are wounded and bleeding. He struggles to come at me his vision clearly dim. I land the final blow and his zombie explodes is a rain of gear. No one moves or says a thing. Clearly there would be no more challengers for today. 


**(The Migration)** I wish I could tell you this adventure had a happy ending. However as with most kingdoms it falls. Yawpton was to small to support our vast population. Food and moral had fallen and our population had grown. We issued an edict that we would move to take Romero via Bell Farm. The journey was long and tough we lost many good men along the way to Zombies and the occasional lucky arrow from a bandit. The presence of 30 men marching down a road in full chain mail and iron swords with their leaders in full iron is daunting to say the least. Road cleared and the small forts along the way quickly abandon as we were seen approaching from the distance. Arriving in Portsmouth we were ambushed by a large group of bandits although not well organised they dealt a sizable blow to our group. Scattered and injured we regroup on the road to make for Romero. Half way there our 20 remaning men fought wave after wave of zombie hoards. Of our original 30 only 15 made it to Romeo. I was not one of them. I fell to a friendly blow from one of my men, on the road just outside the promised land. As it was an accident he was not punished. However this is were my journey ends. The Legion of Yawpton though, they carried on for a few more hour in Romeo alas it was late and they were weakened from a long journey. They to eventually fell...   


**TL;DR: A journey of 2 good men who raised an army and brought law and order to Yawpton on Server 2. They then journeyed across the server with a team of 30 to take and live in Romero.**

I know - say whaaaaat?! 1 year ago we were a little server of around 50 people with Romero, Camp Bell (the original design), Evergreen Manor, Whitehaven, Spire (original design) and Huntsgrove and a small part of Portsmouth being the only buildings on the map. Crazy right?

So 1 year ago I hadn't spoke to Highlife in a good year or so. The last time I saw him I was building a scavenger event for his server marked with these stone markers for people to find on his alpha server. This was back when there were no mobs in Minecraft multiplayer - you just mined and built stuff all day lol. [FUN FACT: You can see one of these stone markers made from obsidian right as you enter the Frostbain Catacombs. Now you know.] Long story short we split ways for a bit and I got an invite to come check out this new thing. I offered to help out building so I set my eyes on a little town called Portsmouth and built that little shop in front of the mansion - yep Kensai's first building.

Here we are 1 year later and my how things have changed. You guys have given us such tremendous support (and grief &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; ) over the last year and I wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Whether you just started playing yesterday or from day 1 we appreciate you joining us and above all I hope you have had many fun adventures in your time here.

We have now expanded into a network of games and will continue to strive to make this the continued #1 multiplayer gaming network in Minecraft. We have such an amazing team here at Shotbow and every member is an essential turning cog in the machine. I think we've done an outstanding job of sticking to our original plan of producing games that we want to play, that are fun and fair. I'm excited to see the new partnerships we form as a network with future gamemodes and I'm happy the Civcraft team could join us.

That said - what is the future of Shotbow? Well I can't tell you much I'm afraid I can only assure you that we have 2 major games in development on an epic scale. We are always feeling out for new partnerships and we will work to continue to treat you guys better than any other gaming network. I've never seen another network where you guys have such a direct line right to the creators and that's something I pride ourself in. I don't feel like at any point you guys felt like you couldn't get your message seen by us. Additionally I believe we did a really good job of transparency by letting you guys know exactly what changed in every game, when we were working on a new one, etc. I aim for us to continue to be as open with you guys as possible about all future developments.

That all said I promised you guys some new stuff for MineZ and I will unfortunately be out of town premiering one of my movies at a theater so I will not be around this weekend to celebrate with you - I'm terribly sorry. I am leaving the build team up to uncovering all the announced areas (minus the mechanical towns - I'll have to do that when I get back sorry) this weekend in celebration of the 1 year anniversary. I'm sure they'll have some fun stuff for you guys to do and above all I hope you continue to enjoy our existing games as we work hard to develop these 2 new epic sized gamemodes.

Thank you for all your support to everyone who told a friend about us, made a video, livestreamed us, was an early kickstarter, bought premium or even bought us a couple drinks or if you ever played our games and had some good clean fun. Without you - we would be nothing.

People talk about zombies needing buffing to counter their influence, or how the game has been ruined by the large-scale power of these groups- but we forget something.

At it's core, this game is a post-apocalyptic survival simulation. Fundamental rules of society have vanished, leaving nothing but the law of the land and the speed of the draw to an individual with their life on the line. Individual survivors have to deal with problems of day-to-day survival, hordes of zombies, and hostile players- but there's another side to the post-apocalypse that isn't usually considered in stories of that ilk.

In the classic post-apocalyptic story, people group together, for protection, for supplies, for company. They fight alongside one another for the sake of their next meal or for something more elegant like a flag or a name. They team. Groups form. The more brutish groups prey on travelers and individuals to bolster the resources of their group, but all engage in turf wars with other groups who fight for the limited resources that exist in the shattered land. There are leaders, and betrayals, and murderers, and heroes- but there is no such thing as no teams. That is not in the nature of humanity.

To be short, ""ClanZ"" is inseparable from the zombie-apocalypse survival game of MineZ that we all play and enjoy. The phenomenon of Clan is simply a further development of that world and mindset, one that comes with it's own further challenges. To say that Clans are breaking the fundamental aspect of the game is to discount the power that makes this game as compelling to us as it is.

EDIT: I personally am involved with no clans and have only witnessed a few battles by individual members. However, I have many friends who would willingly join me on a quest for the North, and our actions while on the warpath would be seen as hostile in exactly the same way that any number of established groups are, to the effect that we would be considered a Clan whether we like it or not. I like to avoid drama where I can, and ticking off the rogue elements of faction-based warfare is not something I'd like to do, but I have no doubt that one of my group's Quests for the North will inevitably end with a face-off against a much better prepared force. Those players will expect us to have a name. So I will fight under the flag of Bastion, my friends alongside me- for this is our survival, our family, and our blade and bow to stem the tide of Death in the land of MineZ.

Thank you all for your responses. I look forward to seeing you on the broken battlefield.",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1368300776.0,,,True,t3_1e4bxn,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/1e4bxn/clanz_not/,

If we find more do not hesitate to complain and I will fix them.

- Implemented a /logout command that starts a 15 seconds timer which will log you out without leaving an NPC, also activated by right clicking in the air with an eye of ender. This is cancelled by movement.

- Fixed the way played_for is calculated so you can view the counter live instead of having to log out to see it.

- Made the /stats show interface a little prettier, remember that this is not the main way stats are meant to be seen. We have more plans to overhaul the website this week.

- Hopefully fixed the infinite lockout glitch when you click respawn before getting kicked on a public server. We will have to see I guess.

- Fixed respawning with items after death.

- Went camping, also went paddleboarding for the first time while I was camping. I kicked the ass's water! (Translation: I fell a lot.)

If you see any issues with persistence and stats following this update please let me know. As of this update any complaints you have stemming from events pertaining to persistence and/or stats are are most likely already fixed.

1. This is a dev build of bukkit, there might be some things that necessitate a roll of a new build quickly

2. I reserve the right to roll back to 1.2.5 at any moment should there be a MAJOR issue

3. Bandit and healer names do not work yet, but I will make them work after rolling 1.3 now that I figured out the new NetworkManager.

4. Added a fix for the invisible login thing. Right now it might cause a player to look like they are floating a half block or so for the first 10 seconds, but it is better than an invisible player, right?

4. Fixed being thrown up through ceilings when logging in that was both an exploit and a glitch.

4. HAVE FUN!!!

---

Players have expressed concern with us running a 1.3 dev build. Here is my justification:

- We can roll back VERY easily

   - No build perms means no risk of losing player progress on builds if we roll back

   - We will not be introducing new items until a release candidate build, if we do so beforehand we can wipe those items from inventories in the database

   - All progress is saved to the database and restored from there so players will not roll back if we roll back, just the surrounding server architecture, meaning you would only notice the rollback because you would have to use 1.2.5 to connect, nothing else about your state will have changed.

1360956086.0,52,self.MineZ,18lg3a,2/15/2012 State of the ShotBow - Settlements and the new map...,HighlifeTTU,68,16,206,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/18lg3a/2152012_state_of_the_shotbow_settlements_and_the/,"Hello MineZers,

I want to take a minute to give you an update on settlements and on the new map.  

**Settlements Update**

I know a lot of you have been anxiously waiting for settlements.  The plugin itself is about 80% complete, but the biggest thing we've been trying to tackle is a raiding mechanic and how we want cross server battles to work.

As of right now, I don't like how the current implementation would work.  To attack another settlement you'd walk outside your settlement, log off, and then log in to another server.  We have protection to prevent people from spawning inside of another settlement (it teleports you outside to a random spot), but it still doesn't feel right to me.  There is no scouting, no traveling.  It feels cheap and is weighed heavily towards the attackers.  But, with the new map I believe we've found the solution.  Read on...

**The New Map**

We are planning on releasing a brand new MineZ map this summer.  However, unlike the current map this MineZ map will be a single instance.  This means that we have different servers run different areas of the map, and traveling from one area to another will move you to another server.  This accomplishes a few things:

1. A single world.  Rather than have 12 instances of the same map, everyone is playing on the same map.  MineZ will truly feel like an MMO.  In the event we need multiple instances, you can have separate characters on each instance.  However, the goal is to support 2000 players per MineZ instance at any given time.  There are a lot of technical hurdles with this, but with the knowledge we've gained from the lobby system we feel there isn't much of a leap for us to accomplish this.
2. No more dupe exploits.  With no server hopping, there won't be dupe issues.  If you log out in a spot, you will log back into that spot.  This will also mean we can remove that join timer, since it exists to prevent such exploits.
3. Expanded world options.  Since we have a single instance of the world, we can have random objectives, better world events, and more.  The issue now is that anything we place in the map duplicates across all the instances, so once someone figures out an event they can log into the other servers to farm it.  Now we can have single events with single rewards and really give the community something to work towards.  Loot will also be easier for us, since you can't get to a location and server hop to keep collecting chests.
4. Isolated regions.  We removed wolves because the AI was too complex and caused lag on the servers.  However, more complex AI is now possible with this setup.  We can now tweak certain regions to allow for the overhead of certain things.  For instance, we may have wolves in one region but have reduced zombies to maintain optimal CPU usage.  This is something to be VERY excited about, as lazer has been getting very good at custom AI.

We are excited to evolve MineZ into a new direction.  There are a lot of thoughts about expanding the achievements system to a weapon proficiency system (killing zombies with a certain weapon increases that weapon's effectiveness), a more dynamic map that shows dynamic objectives, and more.  

**Bringing Settlements to Life**

With the new world, travel is no longer about logging out of one server and logging into another.  Want to attack another settlement?  Pack up your bags and get ready for a road trip.  This is huge.  It allows recon, the ability for settlements to prepare for attacks, ambushes, and more.  Gathering resources is more exciting, as you now have multiple settlements wandering the map to secure the necessary resources to build and maintain their settlement buildings.

So what I'm getting at here is this.  Settlements is going to release with the new map.  It doesn't make sense for us to code settlements for the current setup if it is going to change soon.  It also means settlements will be a better feature on release since the concept really makes more sense on a full map.

**Public versus Private**

The existing classic MineZ map will remain public.  It will maintain the same thrilling experience it does today and will also see new features so long as those new features make sense for the old and new instances.  

*The new map will be premium only*.  Why?  Because the infrastructure to support this is going to cost a lot of money and the experience will be far better.  MineZ sees 140,000 unique players in a week and the current setup lends well for that many players.  Is there a slot? Cool, you can join.  Is there no slot? Sorry, you wait.  However, with a single world supported by multiple servers, you run into a lot of balancing issues.  You want to have plenty of overhead in each server region to ensure players can move from region to region easily.  If you pour in thousands of players, it isn't feasible.  As I stated before, public servers will stay around using the classic map, which I feel is an amazing experience as it stands today.  However, you will need to open your wallet to play on the new map since we cannot afford such an ambitious project without the support of the people playing it.  I break this news to the community now, as I don't want folks to get excited and be let down later on.  

The current premium system will be unchanged.  Those of you who are platinum today will maintain unlimited access so long as we are running servers.  We firmly believe in fairness to our players, and for those of you who have spent $100 on the ShotBow Network, you are not expected to pay a dime more to play MineZ.  We may be having an early beta pass for sale to help with the increased costs, but after it is complete your premium works for the new map.

**Final Thoughts**

I know this is a lot to chew on, and some of this will come as a surprise to many of you.  I hope you see the reasoning behind all of this and that we hope to evolve MineZ into an even more impressive and exciting game.  The future is bright for MineZ, and I hope you are as excited as I am for the new map.

Towns: When all 195 players are connected to the server, EVERY town is full. It's very hard to get any items in any town. Before the 200 player servers, in whitehaven there would be 1 - 2 people in there at the best of times, now theres 6+ every time i go there making it impossible to get chests.

Mindless PvP: The mindless pvp has shot up, everyone just killing eachother at spawn. No idea why, they are probably just being assholes.

Yes! I logged in: Now you have to wait another 5 minutes to be able to spawn because ALL the spawn points are taken.

Mapsize: If you're going to keep these 200 player servers, The map is way to small for this, coming back to my point of towns.
(200 players on Dayz is considered to be pretty crowded, and that map is HUGE)

Thanks for your time.

Edit: Servers are now 175, which barely made a difference, 150 was ok i guess, but when the servers come out of beta and more public servers are open, i think 100 player servers would be the best amount of players on 1 server.

1. Know the game. This includes knowing the map, having it while you play, knowing what items do, knowing where loot is found... The wiki is very important for stuff like this and it is surprising how much better people do when they know what is going on and how to do simple stuff.

2. When in doubt, get away from the south. This simple almost rhyming rule is very important. This is MY philosophy about the south, it is open for debate though. People spawn in the south. Only a fraction of them go north, so lots of people are in the south. More people, less food. Less food, more hunger, so that means more killing. I've found people are much nicer when they have a full hunger bar, which are most people in the north.

3. Don't kill unless your life depends on it. Combat in this game is a lose-lose situation. If you get hit you lose health. It requires swinging, sometimes jumping and very often sprinting, all of these cause you to lose hunger and these things (not swinging, but especially sprinting) attract zombies. But if you are being charged at by a person with a red name combat is necessary.

4. Be prepared. You would be surprised how much better you do at traveling when you have a bow, some arrows, some food, bandages, maybe even potions compared to your starter gear. Spawn, go to the nearest location, loot, move on.

5. Be smart with your resources. This may seem simple, but it is very helpful. Only carry a maximum of about three water bottles, eat nonstackable food first, easy things like that.

6. Trust no one.  Even that green named person that just healed you. Even the nice traveler that gave you a stone sword. Keep an eye on people. Expect everything.

7. Location. Try to stay away from southern towns for long periods of time. If a place is empty, loot it, even stay there awhile.

8. Movement. When you are alone in a great spot and you see names coming toward you hold shift like your life depends on it. For those of you that don't know sneaking behind a wall makes your name invisible to people on the other side of that wall. Also sneak when near zombies and when jumping. And avoid mountains when traveling.

9. Teaming. Small teams of people you trust (even better if you know them) work very well. Communication over skype, or some other voice chat, is very helpful as you don't have to talk in-game, letting people know your plans and that you are nearby.

10. Help others. Have eight cookies and full hunger? Sure, give one or two away. Come across a traveler while you have healing supplies? Go head and heal him. This makes the game more fun for other people, is a nice gesture, and you may even get something from them in return. (This tip is often why this isn't the best survival guide, but I like helping others when I have what I need.)",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,False,,steve format,True,t3_y7eyy,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/y7eyy/my_10_minez_rules/,

I will tell you in clear and concise words, how to heal your friends in MineZ.

Supplies Needed:

* Paper. (This is a bandage)

* Shears. (This cuts the bandage)

* Optional: Ointments, Red and Lime (Healing and Curing respectively)

The first thing you need to do is whack your friend with a bandage. You left click (hit them) with the bandage to start the process. If you right click, you'll waste the whole thing on yourself.

After you hit them with the bandage, you have the option of putting on ointments. If you put on red, you'll give them more health. If you put on green, you'll heal their nausea. To put the ointments on, you have to hit them with whichever ointment you choose.

To finish up the neat patch job, you'll take your shears out to cut the bandage, hit them (left click) with your shears, and the bandage will be neat and secure, letting your teammate, friend, or friendly survivor heal up.


I hope this helped, and I hope you know how to heal now!

=====Inventory Tweaks=====

I felt that we've added enough items where inventory is getting a little crunched.  To give a slight alleviation to this, I've modified the following:

* Wheat is now stackable to 3
* Cocoa beans are now stackable to 3
* Reduced bread stack from 5 to 3.

This should give a LITTLE extra inventory space, and help you carry around some of the non-food items while you look for a crafting table.  The reduction of the bread stack was to balance this change. 

=====Zombie Reach=====

Adjusted the zombie reach a bit higher.  I noticed last night that when crouched the zombies were unable to hit you if they came at you the wrong direction.  This should fix that little issue.  This will make zombies a bit more difficult though.  I will work on an alternative to this tonight, but reducing zombie reach was not a good method.

=====Loot Adjustments=====

* Added gunpowder as a rare chance in epic chests.  This means you can now use it with a brewing station to turn those offensive potions or healing potions into splash potions.  If this ends up being too overpowered, it could be removed.
* Reduced the chance of iron armor slightly in the epic chest.

=====Giant Kaboom======

* Increased the damage from the Giant stomp slightly (well, doubled it.  That is slight, right?).  I noticed players in iron were pretty much non-effected by this, and also noticed that the current strategies have the Giant stomp a less common occurrence.  I've adjusted this to offset that fact.  Remember that the damage is reduced the further you are from the stomp, so it should not be much of a change if you are far away, but is more dramatic if you are right next to the Giant.

That's it!  As always, I'll be monitoring the world to see if further tweaks are needed.",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1343496630.0,,developerred format,True,t3_xaxnp,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/xaxnp/few_balance_tweaks_today/,moderator

I understand the need for challenge and to prevent easy outs for players in a game meant to be brutal, but when I die I want to feel that it was my own fault rather than an oversight in the design of the game.

As far as I can recall, this mechanic was inspired by a developer watching a live stream as the streamer slowly chipped away at a horde of zombies from above. Players will always find a cheap or simple solution to overcome obstacles in games. While I don't agree with the kneejerk addition of mechanics to eliminate these tactics, I understand why it's done. However I don't believe forcing a player from their position is the answer, it gives the player a sense that they have lost control of the game which is never a good idea. Even in a zombie apocalypse scenario, the player should feel that they are in control of what happens.

Instead I propose that, much like spiders in the vanilla game, Zombies have the ability to scale vertical walls. If you have aggravated a horde of zombies, high land is no longer a permanent solution. If one or two zombies are in chase you can hold your position and knock them back, however a horde of 10 or so zombies would be difficult to manage, and would force you to continue the escape.

At the very least, this mechanic would prevent players from slowly chipping away at the horde from high ground and force them to take action, which solves our initial problem without resulting in scenarios that makes the player feel that they have no control of the situation or that result in deaths that the player will feel they were not responsible for.",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,False,,,True,t3_zoan9,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/zoan9/suggestion_pulling_is_currently_a_bad_mechanic/,

If anybody is interested in watching my group be MLG MineZ, check out http://cannibalmovies.tk  :) 



Hey all. I've been playing MineZ for a week now and I'm to the point where gearing up, getting food, and getting up north takes me about half an hour. I'm really getting tired (and confused) with all the threads about the game being ""too difficult"" or how ""omg bandits r assholes pls ban them"". I wouldn't say I'm an actual bandit, because I don't go around slaughtering freshly spawned players for no reason. Most of my kills occur up north when I'm getting low on supplies or I feel threatened, in which case I kill on sight whenever I can. Anyways, who cares about all that. Let's dive into some tips!

- Understand each major area. You want to go through and make sure you know what sort of things spawn there (military supplies or food), whether there is water nearby, and how populated the area tends to get. If you don't know the different areas and you're in the north and low on food, running to the nearest town only to find its full of military supplies is going to get you killed. Not to mention that certain areas are bandit havens, where we tend to camp and wait around to catch some players unaware.

- Know where the hell the rivers are. Seriously. You don't want to get up north only to realize you forgot to refill your water bottles and you have no clue where the nearest source of water is.

- Have a plan. Don't just spawn in and say ""I guess I'll try here and then here"". Thats a sure fire way to die. A better choice would be ""Well I spawned 500m from here, and I know it has military supplies. I'll head up there and then over to there, where food spawns. I'll grab the food and then head to this church and see if I can grab some healing pots"". 

- Do not trust A N Y B O D Y. If somebody blocks, block back quickly and move along out of their reach. And check behind you often. Don't forget you can double tap F5 to look behind you. If they're following you, get the hell out of there.

- Tell people to screw off. This goes along with not trusting anybody. If somebody is trying to convince you to come into a house through a door filled with cobwebs so they can throw you some food, tell them they can fuck right off. Its very easy to have two people crouching around the corners holding bows, waiting for you to get caught in the webs.

- Be aware. I can't tell you how many times my buddies and I have been up north in Frostbain or Whitehaven and we saw some kid prancing along through the trees, not even checking his surroundings. You are an easy kill if you're not looking around. I don't care if you're in full iron armor with a sweet bow and grenades to boot. If we get the jump on you because you weren't looking around, you're going to die.

- If you find a group of people and they definitely saw you, don't tell them to screw off this time. Be nice. Say something along the lines of ""I'm just passing through, I don't want to fight"". My two friends have itchy bow fingers, but when somebody says something like that to us I always say ""No no, let him go. I don't wanna bother him"". 

- Don't bother freshly spawned players. Seriously. They have nothing of value to you. They've probably had to respawn for the hundredth time today. Be nice and offer them some supplies maybe. There are plenty of items to go around. And if your group is low on bandages or water bottles, just ask politely. Offer a trade. If worst comes to worst and you're really desperate, a simple ""We really need a bandage. Drop one or we'll shoot"" is sufficient. 

- Don't waste arrows even if you have arrows to waste. The scariest moment for our group is always when we do an arrow count and realize we've only got ~two stacks each. That simply is not enough. You're going to be using those things up fast, so keep a good stock with you. We try to always have at least 90 per person before heading out to PvP spots.

- Know which areas are dangerous. The southern towns are going to get you killed. Ignore them if you can. Areas that are highly populated are not safe at all. You will die unless you get in and get out in a timely fashion.

- Don't sit around trying to farm chests. We've made this mistake quite a few times. You need to be quick. If you need to stop at Forest for some mushrooms or Frostbain for some food, thats fine. Run through and grab the chests, maybe do a second sweep, and them move along. Don't attempt to camp out there for an hour.

- BRING FRIENDS! This is the most important tip ever. Seriously! Don't be socially awkward. If you know some people who play MineZ or who play Minecraft at all, get them in Skype and meet up in game. Have each player spawn in and hit up different spots. Have one person go for food, one go for military supplies, etc etc. Don't all meet up off spawn. A group of kids in leather gear won't scare people away.

- Once you're all geared, you're good to go. My group has learned that nobody will mess with three kids in full iron. We've run into larger groups that even told us ""We don't want any trouble"". Being intimidating comes naturally after you're geared up.

- Don't fuck with kids who have better gear than you do. This goes along with the rule up above, I suppose. We were in Romero once to grab some healing pots and generally ignored the few kids that were there. However, we were doing an inventory check when I turned around to see a kid in full leather aiming his bow at my friend. He missed his shot by a mile and the three of us took him out with one arrow each. You're not going to kill a big group like that. Just ignore them. There's no reason to even try.

- Don't run around saying ""team??? team???? team??? friendly??? team???? food??? healing?? team??? team??"". When we get spammed with ""TEAM????"" we usually just kill the kid. Its annoying. We're in full iron gear, we don't want a newly spawned player running around with us having to use the chat to speak with us. Sorry, but you'd just be extra weight that we'd have to look after. 

- If you're in the south and see a group of people in nice gear, ignore them. Stay away from them if you can. As far away as possible. When we go south, we usually don't bother people. Most bandits will, though. We once saw a group of four in mixed chainmail/iron who rolled into Romero and started killing kids left and right. A few grenades took care of them.

- If you're trying to be a bandit, you don't need to be an asshole. Not everyone needs to die. You're often going to be wasting arrows on people who have nothing of value to you. Don't. Just don't. You do not need to go to Grimdale and start a slaughter in the streets. You may have your iron and your bow and arrows, but when you piss off an entire town, you're going to die. By the way, you don't need ALL the loot from kills. Take what you need and leave the rest there. We made some kid's day in Romero when we killed somebody attacking him, grabbed what we needed, and told him he could take the rest. We even stood guard while he picked up the loot. tl;dr - Don't be a dick.

- Finally, relax. Just relax. Its a game. You got attacked right off spawn? Whatever, you can probably get a better spawn anyways. A group of bandits jumped you in the woods? PvP is a part of the game, get used to it. You keep dying every five minutes? You're playing the game wrong, try again. 

If anybody has any extra tips, throw them down below. I would also like to say that I didn't mention any specific towns that have good loot because I think players should discover this stuff on their own. It took us a full day of wandering, exploring, and respawning to finally get a good route down. 

Oh, and finally I'd like to thank the devs for such a great game. Its really awesome to see how involved you all are in the community and how open to feedback you are.

1341776067.0,52,self.MineZ,w8dea,MineZ Updates - 7/8/2012,HighlifeTTU,59,7,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/w8dea/minez_updates_782012/,"Just a quick heads up on what we've been working on.

**Backend Enhancements**

* MineZ servers now check for and roll out major updates automatically.  This means if we do an update on the main server, you will get to see that update on all the other servers much, much faster.
* Synchronized the system clocks.  This should fix some of the weird issues with any game play elements that are saved that deal with a time stamp and improve stability since the plugins won't hit as many confusing things.

**PvE Test Server is Up!**

* I just changed smp3.minez.net to be a PvE (Player versus Environment) server.  In other words, PvP is disabled.  To facilitate this change, I made mods hit a little harder, spawn a little faster, and the chance of getting disease is higher.  I wanted to at least get a slightly tweaked version to you guys prior to release so you can test it out.  Right now it shares the data with the other servers, but on release it would be its own database instance, meaning your items would only cross to other PvE servers, if we decided to roll out more of them.  I can't promise I'll be able to spend a lot of time on the PvE server prior to release, but please give your feedback on it.  I did want to show you guys I wasn't full of hot air when I said I would get one up for you guys.

**Ender Eyes?!?**

* Endereye Communication.  If you find an ender eye, it acts as a little radio.  When you are holding the device, your messages are send with an [Eye] prefix.  Only other players holding the ender eye can hear you.  So if you send a message and your buddy has his sword in hand, he won't hear it.  Let me repeat that.  YOU MUST BOTH BE HOLDING THE ENDER EYE TO COMMUNICATE.  We aren't sure if we will give everyone one of these as a starting item, or if we are going to make it a loot item.  We'll see.  We'll be tweaking this as we get feedback.

**Euro Server Update**

* Euro server isn't going to be up today.  I am still working on finding a good host.  I need a host that has the type of hardware and reputation that my US host has.  I don't want to rush this, but I am in contact with some hosts on getting this box up as quick as I can.  I will have these out prior to release for testing, hopefully in the early part of next week.

**Sleep Achievement Unlocked**

* I got my first full night of sleep in a while.  Damn it feels good.

I'll go step by step and add in some pro-tips. (I'm a bad writer)

Steps to winning:


1) Go to portsmouth | Coords = X: -95 Z: -526

2) Obtain food/health pots and lots of water bottles (you will need lots of water bottles to easily do step 4)

3) Head to spire | Coords = X: 664 Z: -184

4) Grind the spire for like 20 - 30 mins and you'll have full iron armor with maybe some enchants, enchanted bow and sword, and lots of arrows/ grenades.

5) ???

6) Success


Pro-tips:

1) When you eat food, you have a short period of time where you can sprint without losing hunger. Sometimes you are given this period of time when you spawn. When you spawn, sprint and jump for fast transportation until you lose your first half bar of hunger. From here on, conserve food.

2) Don't engage in PvP except for self defense until you've grinded to iron at the spire. It just isn't worth it. Risk &gt; Reward - If you don't have full iron, anyone that you are able to kill without having full iron yourself will probably have shit.

3) Don't trust people. Douchebags will kill you just for teh lulz. If someone is screaming in chat to heal people and is in iron/chain, don't trust it.

4) If you're gonna group up, use teamspeak or skype or something. People will not be nearly as likely to fuck you over if they took the time to get on skype / TS with you. Also, it is easier to communicate.

5) Don't feed the noobs. This may seem cruel, but if you're begging for food, you're a BK and you're gonna die anyway. Feeding em' just prolongs the inevitable.

6) Grimdale is bad for noobs. Your shit will get rocked.

7) Manage your inventory space. You have 36 slots, make good use of them. Don't carry around garbage that you wont use. ex: 8 water bottles

8) Hotbar. Heres how mine looks: (in order)

Sword | Bow | Instant health II splash | Bandage | milk | Food (usually cookies) | health II pot | enderpearl | enderpearl |

9) ALWAYS have milk/bandages. You can have full iron and get bit once and die from bleeding if you have no bandage.

10) If you become a bandit, remember this: Survival &gt; kills - Don't run into a crowd of 8 leather guys even if you have full iron. You may be able to kill most of em, but you wont be able to survive 8 wooden swords + 8 zombies.

11) It is better to fight off 1 or 2 or maybe 3 zombies if you are chasing them then to run and attract an entire hoard.

12) COOKIES ARE KING! They stack in 8 !

I asked myself, ""what is the biggest problem, the biggest disappointment with being spawn camped?"" The death ban.  that feeling that if I draw an unlucky card and land next to y_ankees my death ban will increase before I get a foothold and there is little I can do about it.

I like the death ban system for this server type, I am not about to suggest its removal.  I also dislike the idea of invulnerability as It doesn't afford protection from spawn camping, it encourages reckless play during the invuln. 

There is a middle ground here.  If a player dies within a certain grace period time limit since his spawn, or before meeting certain prerequisites (distance traveled chests opened ect.) Then the death timer does not increase.  This grace period could be tweaked to have a static respawn timer: die withing you first 5 minutes and it will only ever take 10 minutes to respawn. Or it could simply take your death ban timer form your last death without increasing it.

This doesn't eliminate the griefer who chooses to be aggressive right after they spawn.  But it does help players feel less defeated if they haven't gotten a foothold on that particular life when they lose it.

1340299918.0,45,self.MineZ,ve2ln,Want to speed up the world build? Got a good idea for a building?  You can help! (Details Inside),HighlifeTTU,51,6,172,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/ve2ln/want_to_speed_up_the_world_build_got_a_good_idea/,"We are hand building the world since a lot of care has to be taken in distance between locations, the loot that spawns at those locations, and their placement on the map.  We used another building pack for the main cities to speed things up a bit, but we don't want to have the world look dull by reusing the same building schematics over and over, so at this point we are building new themed buildings for most of the new towns.

But are you a good builder?  Want to see your hard work in the server?  Make a creation and submit it to us.  If we like what we see, you may soon stumble upon your work in the main world!

**How to do this**

Step 1:  Determine what you want to create.  Buildings in the server follow certain loot conventions.  They are as follow:

1. Standard house: Filled with common loot, these houses are mostly decorative and act to fill a town.  

2. Tool Drops: Think barns, warehouses, or the like  These buildings drop tools for players to use.

3. Basic Military Drops: These are military buildings inside of a city.  Think a small watch tower, a barracks, or what not.  They should be simple military, since they would be a traditional place for town watch to be stationed.  Noting huge or fancy.  The alternative to this is a blacksmith or archery location, since those would naturally have basic weapons as well.

4. Shops:  Shops hold the better food items and one is located in each town.  Right now we could use a couple desert themed shops and some winter themed shops.

Step 2: Start building.  Keep the buildings of a reasonable size.  Most of the town buildings sit on a 5-20 block piece of land.  

Step 3: Use worldedit to copy the schematic.  Use MCEDIT as the save type.  Position yourself in front of the building as close and centered as you can to the area you are copying.  We use a naming convention.  That is:

* NAME OF BUILDING_DIRECTION

For example, say you make a winter themed shop.  You might make it ""WinterShop_N"", indicating that you copied and saved it while facing north.  We use Rei's minimap to determine direction.

Step 4: Submit to /r/minez and recieve mad karma!  Please submit a screenshot of the building's exterior and interior, then a link to the schematic.

Look forward to seeing what the community comes up with!

EDIT: Maybe I can get a quick creative server with a flat world setup so you don't need to worry about the world editing.  If you are interested, post your in game name in the subreddit and if the response is high enough, I can set it up tonight on my test box.

EDIT2: Don't use ladders.  The AI doesn't like ladders right now.  We are working on this, but for the time being don't use them.  Players can use them to be entirely safe even if there is a giant group of zombies giving them chase.",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1340306071.0,,developerred format,True,t3_ve2ln,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/ve2ln/want_to_speed_up_the_world_build_got_a_good_idea/,moderator

- Changed chat prefixes for silver gold and plat members to a small [S] [G] and [P] before their name to clean chat up. If any of you silver gold or plat members object please let me know.

- Moved our chat manager to the new Async chat event

- Squashed some new issues that cropped up with 1.3/Plugins like breaking a web with a shovel crashing the whole damn server (Apparently block.setTypeId(0) in the onBlockBreak causes a concurrent modification exception now...)

- Fixed teleporting up in 2 high areas.

- Switched to AntiCheat on the 1.3 rollout, promptly switched back to NCP

- Various performance fixes to compensate for the increased traffic 1.3 requires. Still nailing down the performance differences and squeezing every ounce out of our plugins.

- Added some method profiling to see where chokepoints are.

- Barely got any sleep for the past 2 days (Not a complaint, an observation :) )",[Change Log] ,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1344186691.0,changelog,developer format,True,t3_xpug5,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/xpug5/85_the_overdue_changelog/,moderator

* Unless you're being chased by a zombie, don't sprint.
* **Unless you're being chased by a zombie, don't EVEN THINK ABOUT sprinting.**
* You can find food in towns, but not much. If you want to find a more abundant supply, check the random buildings scattered around, or find a wooden hoe and one of the abandoned farms.
* Bread and Cookies both stack. Every food item gives you .5 hearts when eaten, so a batch of cookies will give you 4 hunger and 4 health, whereas bread will give you 3.5 hunger and .5 health. Cookies seem like the obvious better food, but keep in mind that bread is faster, and has a higher saturation level (you'll stay full for longer).
* You need to be a decent distance away from chests for them to respawn. Don't camp in one place.
* Repair your gear. You'll find plenty of low durability items, combine them in your crafting box to get longer lasting gear. Note: Repairing enchanted items will remove the enchantment.
* If you see a fellow player and want to team up with them, don't run up next to them without announcing yourself. Type something in chat, or use the ""crouch/block combo"". Most people will be welcome to team with you, but be cautious, not everyone is friendly.
* You'll find plenty of food/health potions along the Coast, but if you want better gear, you'll need to venture north. Don't expect to stay alive with just loot from the south, you'll want better gear if you're going to survive the constant onslaught of zombies.
* Due to the lack of a deathban during the BETA, PvP is rampant along the coast. You'll want to move further inland to avoid the kids camping spawn points. This will sort itself out once the deathban is implemented.
* Avoid trusting people that you don't know well. During the Apocalypse, people will be desperate to survive, and if they want the food you have, they might try to take it by force.

**REMEMBER, we're still in BETA, and things are subject to change.**

I've always loved hardcore since the idea of not being able to play for some time after a death makes the game have an intensity you don't find in a standard respawn-on-death game.

For MineZ, I wanted to do something similar.  But not for three days.  I was envisioning a short death ban, along the lines of an hour, so that players can try multiple times in a day, but can't just zerg rush.  

It is important not to allow instant respawn, since you can literally pull a train of zombies towards players.  If you decide to do this, thats fine, but I don't want players dieing near the coast and then immediately rushing back towards their attacker.  It is a disservice to the player who is being careful, and rewards sloppy play.

That being said, there have been about 1800 deaths in a couple days from the 20-30 testers who have been playing.  The good news?  They love it.  After their initial 5-10 deaths, they start to ""get it"" and their life span increases dramatically.  However, the challenge is the learning curve.  While I desperately want to have a death ban to encourage players to be more mindful of their actions, I don't necessarily want players to feel that the game is too unforgiving.  I'm all about a learning curve, it makes games more fun.  

The current system is as follows:

* Players who die are banned temporarily for 1-hour.  This is a global ban across all of the MineZ servers.
* New players (first time we create player data) are given five ""instant respawn"" lives.  This means for your first go of the plugin, you can die five times and instantly get into the action.

Looking at it, it seems fair.  But I feel this is a critical element that changes the feel of the mod.

A new watcher for HcF Samstag1 presented a very good idea to me. MineZ Needs Watchers. For everyone who doesn't know what these significant angels do, they record and report all of the hackers they can. Since these will be trusted people, there's no way that the Admins cannot ban that certain person, which is helpful to you guys. There will always be hackers on MineZ, and I realize the admins are doing their best to help the situation. I don't think they could handle it all, Admins, pick a few people who would be up to the job. Now, what I've been told is that Watchers don't have access to kick/ban commands. All they need to do is kind of ""patrol around"". I feel like this would be a very helpful idea to the people who still play MineZ and are sick of hackers appearing so frequently.

It can be a useful tool, or just take up space in your inventory. I have just a few ideas to add some uses to it like they have added grave robbing to the spade. These ideas will only reward the owner of the hoe healing equipment, therefor it is nothing overpowered, just hopefully an incentive to heal others. So the first new thing the hoe could do is harvest roses. When a player uses the wooden hoe on a rose, it has a chance of dropping rose red dye. As for the level of chance it could be high since rose red can only be used  for good (healing others) or it could be a low chance since roses are not rare. The other use of the hoe for healing equipment would be simply that if the final blow to a zombie is dealt with a wooden hoe, then the zombie will drop a lime dye. I feel this one should no doubt be a 100% drop chance since killing zombies with hoes is not so easy. But it would be the final blow, so shoot it with a bow then finish it with the wood hoe would also cause the drop. Just a simple idea to add new features to the hoe, and give players more chance to heal others with all the dye equipment.

We have a lot of experience dealing with hacked clients, and regularly test the most popular clients to ensure the we are preventing the various hacks available on Minecraft SMP servers.  We've been doing this a long time, and we are VERY good at catching people.  We also have custom coded plugins designed to catch things other servers cannot, which is the benefit of having such an experienced development team.  Many times a hacked user is unaware we are logging his action, but we are.  This allows us to collect a lot of data over time, which ensure we are handing out valid bans and also ensure we do not ban someone who false flags the anticheat measures due to lag or something else.  In other words, it is only a matter of time before we find a user with a hacked client.

I just want to post this as a warning to those of you who may choose to use hacked clients.  If we find you using a hacked client, you will be banned from MineZ and will be unable to access all public and private servers (we have a global ban system).  On top of this, it is directly against our terms of service when you purchase access to the MineZ servers.  

If you do this and get caught, we will not refund your money and I will show paypal proof that you recieved the appropriate access and that we caught you doing something against our terms of service.  Paypal does not allow you to dispute a payment because you were caught hacking in a server, so if you plan to hack in MineZ be aware you are taking the risk of losing access to the servers and the money you spent to gain that access.  

Why the hard stance?  We are very careful on handing out bans and only do so with firm, indisputable evidence.  The worst thing we could ever do is falsely ban a user, so because of this an incredible amount of diligence is performed in regards to any ban we place.  As such, we do not want to enable a user to be refunded their money, then repurchase access to MineZ with those funds only to hack on a different user name.

I will be linking this in the side bar to ensure everyone is aware of the policy.  To date, we've only banned two people using hacked clients, but I anticipate this number to increase as more public servers roll out.  We take hacking very seriously, as it ultimatley degrades the overall experience for those users who are playing fairly.  

Thank you for your continued support of MineZ.  While I know a post like this isn't fun or exciting, this is something that needs to be stated very clearly so that any user who may consider gaining an unfair edge understands the consequences of those actions.

There could be a certain item you could obtain which would allow you to create a small fire pit on the ground as a one time use and then the item would dissapear. The fire could last maybe 5 minutes, and then it would burn out. When I say fire, I don't mean just a block of fire in front of you, I mean a few logs in the ground appear surrounding a bit of fire in the center, with some half steps around them; something that looks nice, but compact. You could use this fire to cook meat from animals that you kill by dropping it in, and through the use of the Minez plugin, the cooked version of that meat would pop out of the fire safely onto the ground.

Possible item for fire: Fire Charge

Now, for the tents, I had a similar idea. Say the night is falling and you know that it will be hard to see zombies around and you want to try to play it safe, but there are no structures around you to try to take refuge in. In a case like this, there would be a specific item that you right click the ground with, and a small tent would appear in front of you. The tent would last the same duration that a Minez night would last, even if it is placed during day, or during day/night transition.

Issues:

Food is not exactly scarce, but hard to reach. The main spots to gain food are the two villages north and south of the spire, and the town shop. However, all three locations are heavily infested with zombies and hard to reach without a group. Considering that food should be the least of your issues it could be a good idea to spread smaller locations around the map that do not provide a lot of food, but keep you from starving.

Health potions are only avaiable in the two churches in the south at the start. For any raid to the north you need a lot of them, but the churches are deep south and, due to their proximity to the start zone, very dangerous; newly spawned players will attack you and probably wear you down sooner or later. I'd suggest adding a church in the western village in the snow biome.

Zombies are almost impossible to fight without heavy losses if you have an european ping. Fuck being european for that matter. Making them easier would, however, also make it too easy for anyone without a stunted connection. I have no solution, but am a bit frustrated that I have to lose 4 hearts to each zombie because I can't keep him from attacking me.

Cacti and Cakes are useless due to their inability of being placed.

Zombies should roam more to give way peacefully to a patiently waiting wanderer, to be a danger outside of known locations and to prevend crowding up into unbreakable bunches.

Arrows are unevenly distributed; In the beginning, you struggle with each shot, but later I had inventories of 45 arrows multiple times. I'd rather have to consider each shot later still.

Random fires look shitty and ruin the immersion. Lazer said they were intentional, but they still look shitty and ruin the immersion. 

Zombies glitch under stairs and sometimes on snow, spinning around senselessly while trying to find a way to you.

The spire is the most useless piece of ... stone ever invented. Also, zombies spawn up there and fall down sometimes, the same happens at another, similar location.

Some items should have a low stack size. Maybe 4 for melons, 2 for apples, 2 for health pots , 2 for cocoa, 2 for empty bottles, 2 for cobwebs and cacti ...

cookies stack to 8 initially, making them a great source of food, but maybe unintentionally.

Too much PvP on the south coast. I don't really have a good fix, but someone needs to get all these kids to do something useful instead of hacking away each other with their pathetic wooden swords. FFS. Maybe make the coast longer. Maybe extend the spawning area.

A team of two is ten times better than going alone, literally. While its great to have big benefits in groups – I love teaming up – it sucks for me as an european (...) and it makes life for lone wolves reeeally hard.

Experience orbs drop from players, but are as useless as you can imagine.

http://i.imgur.com/sl378PU.jpg

since health in MOBAs is usually sporadic, the 10 hearts that minecraft has just doesnt cut it, so you'd need to put the health in something outside the health meter. MOBAs have mana and shit too so you'd need to put the mana somewhere in there. this is just a proposal on how you could accomplish this.

there would be the standard 3 spells and 1 ultimate. i aint an expert on coding and i dont really know how things work, but judging by the fact that the shotbow weapon and the regular bow can co-exist, i dont think there would be any complications in making separate spells. if there is though, minecraft still has a shitload of items ready to be re-textured.

for the inventory, you'd still have 6 items like in a regular MOBA, but since inventory space is limited there could be a button to switch to the other 3 items

for leveling there could be an indicator in the inventory or the actual XP bar if its not being used for something else. 

http://i.imgur.com/F3wvYFI.png

the inventory should contain a variety of statistical icons telling you how much of a stat and this and that you have. highlife can decide the complexity of the gamemode though, and just fill these with that one weird wooden texture item he always uses.

this is the shopkeeper. he could work like the wasted shopkeeper except with a few more pages. i guess.

http://i.imgur.com/Vt0IDkV.png

the map could look roughly like this. or maybe it could be diagonal like the usual moba maps? 

i like the red buffs and blue buffs that league has so maybe that could be implemented into this hypothetical moba gamemode. the big creep in the river could be a giant.. or a wither.. i guess? just some stationary big guy that requires a big force to kill.

there could be a bunch of heroes you could buy with shotbow xp, and a set of 10 free heroes that's cycled around.

to identify the heroes of your team and the heroes of the enemy team each player of the team would wear one of the 5 vanilla heads, so highlife doesnt need to buy minecraft accounts to give the heroes skins and such. allies would have a green name and enemies would have a red name, so identification is easy. example: ""oh man guys [HERONAMEHERE] is enemy wither skull. b!""

I've played vanilla minecraft for a while, and I can't say I get too much into it. After a while I switch over to creative and see what I can build. It is just plain boring sometimes.

So when I learned about MineZ from a friend of mine, I wasn't sure how I would feel playing by myself. I like zombie horror games, I like sandbox games, and I like survival games. So I wasn't too sure how this was going to be since it just seemed like a minecraft with people and more rules.

So I decided to do this right and downloaded the texture pack that turns the eye of ender into a walkie talkie and such. Logged in and went into the lobby. Decided on a server and away I went.

I read the rules figured out what I needed to do and what I couldn't do and decided to jump right in.

At first the confusion was there as I was bobbing in the water. I found land and decided to do a little exploration. I quickly found the road and decided to head east. Not but 1 minute later I come across a place called Geuten. I had turned off the music long ago to add more atmosphere to this game. I see a zombie off in the distance and I debate on whether sneaking or out right killing the zombie would be better. I decide to sneak around to a building and explore that. So far nothing too different from vanilla minecraft save for a texture pack. The building has no chest so I head to this building with a spire and fire at the roof. I enter the door and am greeted by a zombie. I kill him and realize my heart is beating a little. I got startled a bit. So I climb up the top and find a chest with a stone sword inside. I think, ""*Sweet*,"" and am contemplating my next move from here. That's when I hear it.

Just below me I can hear the sounds of fighting and I see a person fighting off 3 zombies. *Do I go down and help? Should I stay out of this? Should I leave the town?* He retreats into a small house as what I thought were two zombies with armor were actually zombie players attacking him. He dies shortly and I see 5 zombies down below with two of them being player zombies and 3 regular zombies. *What was I suppose to do? If I went down there I probably would die too. Oh my god, is this what this game is? Is this game going to be like this the whole time?* I think I might like this game.

I eventually make it down the tower as the zombies were distracted by something in the woods. I make my way over to the church and pick up some potions. I continue to raid the town for resources and find myself with water, bandages, shears, lime dye and red dye, plenty of food, fully repaired armor, fully repaired wood sword, and a friend. I shared my potions with him and gave him some bandages. I thought, ""*Well I play a cleric or healer in most games, maybe I can do that here.*"" Eventually I decide to head out of town to explore some more. My new friend and I split ways. He heads north, I head south.

A zombie comes running up and I begin to start defending myself, but the zombie keeps hitting me, and I see a person coming up to me. Thinking he might help I turn and try to circle the zombie so that I can keep from getting killed.

**I die**.

I'm not sure how it happened, but I died. Maybe the player got me, maybe the zombie got me. Either way, I had to start over. Everything gone, and I didn't mind too much. The game was interesting. Yes, I wasn't happy that I lost all that loot, but it happens.

This time I find myself in a autumn like place, and soon come up to a place called Grimdale. I wasn't sure how I was going to get in here as it seemed the whole city was walled off. I then come across another player running into the city. I wasn't sure if I should follow him or not. He turns to me and walks up to me. I want to keep my distance.

""Hi.""

""Hello,"" I'm still not sure how I should handle him. I keep my back to the wall and don't allow him to get near me.

""Friendly?"" He begins to run past me.

""Yeah, I'm friendly,"" I say back, completely disarmed. Ok, surely this person is good and kind. I follow him into the city and he begins looting on one side of the city and I go into a place with a pole dancing area on the top floor. I find so much medical gear, but not much in the way of food. Plenty of fresh water and plenty of bandages. Eventually another person ends up in Grimdale, but he's hurt. So I go up to him and start healing him. Then people start asking outside of the church asking if someone is healing. I tell them I'm a doctor and I can heal them if they go to the second floor of the hotel. People start lining up and I just start healing them. More people start showing up in Grimdale, and I keep sharing armor and weapons. They share food. There are now seven of us in Grimdale, and we decide to protect Grimdale. I become the resident doctor, and they begin to form a watch.

""INTRUDER!""

I watch from the church as men start running to one side of Grimdale, the Thieves Guild side.

""Friendly?"" There's no reply as the person is shortly murdered. I didn't think much of it. Maybe he attacked our guard. What should I care. I need to keep our milk and bandages maintained. My inventory is full of milk, bandages, dyes, potions, and three shears. More *intruders* keep showing up at Grimdale, and I decide to wander around to help the guards.

Three of the guards *found* a button on one of the *intruders* and decided to explore the sewers. They asked if I wanted to come, but I declined and said I wanted to make sure the guards that were left were being taken cared of. So off they went. I made my way to the Thieve's Guild area and looked at the hall.

**I got hit**.

I turn to see a character hitting me. Some player attacking me, and I called out to the guards while defending myself.

**I died**.

I respawn and tell my team that I am returning to Grimsdale, thinking they would wait for me. I find myself in the desert heading west to Grimsdale. I come across another player.

""Friendly,"" I ask, hoping to have a travel partner.

""Yeah, I am if you are,"" he says.

""I'm heading to Grimsdale. There's some good guys there waiting. They'll set you up with some good gear and food if you like,"" I turn to head towards the town I had come to love.

""Cool,"" is all he says.

**I got hit**.

I turn to see him attacking me. I don't understand what is happening for a moment. *Why is he attacking me?*

**I die**.

I respawn near Grimsdale this time. I make my way to the town and ask if my friends are there. It's silent. No one is there. I'm alone. They had all left and all that remained were the zombies. I loot what I can carry for a long walk and am killed by the person I just got through healing on my way out of Grimsdale.

Now I don't team up with anyone that I don't know, which is everyone. I see a person off in the distance and I sneak my way around them. People get near me and I point a bow to their face. I hide in the woods and only come into town for food and resources if needed. Keeping a keen ear on the radio to hear what people are saying about other people and taking note on who to especially avoid. Keeping an eye on herds and making sure to keep some snowballs on hand just in case. You learn a lot in just two days. I plan on making my way north.

**TL;DR: If you are thinking about playing this game, DO IT! This is the funnest game I have ever played in my life. This game plays on your emotions, your mind, and your will to survive! Trust No One! Walk Softly, and carry a big Sword!**

I loot the place and got some bandages, rose red (dye), and shears. I wasn't really much of a ""murderer"" and decided to go to the Grimdale church. I went down the aisle and told everyone in the chat that I would heal them for free. People started piling in one at a time and I healed them all. One person, sniper001, appreciated my act of kindness and said that we would stay in the church as a guard (of some sort). Many more players who I've healed did the same. I handed them all extra armor, weapons, and potions/food. I just wanted to be known as a ""Good Guy Greg"". After healing many people, some of them became medics. It was going pretty great and I made some friends. We killed some bandits in town and hostile people. We were like a large group. A few of us were killed and the group slowly disbanded.

Prologue 2: The next day, I was playing MineZ and found some of my old friends (not from yesterday). There were two guys, Brody and Nuclear. We decided to meet up in Grimdale. After being killed multiple times by spawn-killing bandits, I finally reached Grimdale and met up with my friend Nuclear in the Grimdale Cemetery. We decided to call Brody to join us, but he already logged off. I had all the equipment I needed for healing someone and so did my friend Nuclear. We saw someone across the iron fence of the cemetery who got hit by zombies. Nuclear tried to heal stranger across the fence, but was hit by him. I hit the stranger behind the fence. He apologized and said it was an accident. We believed him, finished healing him, and the stranger behind the fence came into the town and found us. He joined our group. We called him ""Ry"" for short. We headed into the church and we decided to heal people for free, just like I did yesterday. We even taught Ry how to heal people. People started piling in and we formed a group. It was a bad idea to let so many people in the church. Sometimes, there would be a bandit/hostile person in the church who started attacking people in the group, but everyone in the group would kill them in a matter of seconds. Since bandits/hostile people would come in occasionally to kill someone, we decided to put some cobwebs in the doorway. It worked well. After a while, Nuclear left. Ry was a bit abusive with his powers and instead of killing bandits only, he (and the rest of the group) started killing anyone they saw at the doorway. **He was becoming the bandit.** I was worried about what would happen. We stopped healing strangers and started killing them. I remember someone saying we were stupid to be hiding in a church, killing random survivors. I decided to tell Ry to stop hurting people and let strangers in to the church to be healed. After that, everything was still the same. We still killed people outside the church. We even received some backfire from enemies. We let one person in, gave him armor and weapons, and healed him. He was surprised at how nice we were to him, even though we already killed a few people. The group disbanded when the server was rebooted and closed for the whole night. The next day, Ry and I decided to log on and heal people again. We were killed by two douchebag bandits when we offered to heal them.

Today's Story: My friend and I were pissed from how we were killed yesterday and all the loot we lost. I decided to give myself another chance and headed to Grimdale. I headed to the second floor of the inn and saw someone next to a pile of random stuff. I thought he was a bandit because of the loot on the ground and killed him. I collect his stuff, including shears and rose red (dye). I quickly logged off just in case someone decided to hunt me down and avenge that guy's death. I got so much adrenaline from that kill and decided to kill another person. I found another person who was alone and killed him too. I climbed to the 3rd floor of the Inn and waited for someone to come up. I saw a person's username through the walls. As soon as he came up the stairs, I killed him. I decided to stop murdering survivors since there's no point, my inventory was full, and there was a lot of people outside who would kill me if they saw what I was doing. Survivors were coming into the Inn and I decided to heal them instead of killing them. After healing some people, I went to the church and offered free healing. After a while, I healed some people and formed a group. I helped out other players and gave them some shears. I taught someone how to heal other players. Everyone started to heal each other instead of killing each other. Everyone was peaceful and formed some sort of ""truce"". No one in town was a bandit. One player even started to tell everyone if there was a bandit in town, and when there was a bandit in town, we murdered him. I told Ry that I was helping people out in Grimdale, so he decided to log on and help out too. He came to Grimdale, I was killed. I decided to go to Grimdale as soon as possible and looked around, but it turns out everyone from my group left or died. The only person who didn't leave or die was the person who was finding the bandits and a few lesser-known players. I healed a few players until I was killed by a horde of zombies while healing a player.

I'm not going to stop healing players. I will still go to Grimdale and help out new players at the Grimdale Church on US Public 1.",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,False,,medic format,True,t3_xz9nw,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/xz9nw/the_time_i_became_the_medic_of_grimdale_turned_a/,

I used to play a lot of MineZ last summer. I stopped playing because the two friends I grouped with lost interest. I recently returned and although I'm enjoying the game again, coming to this subreddit to discuss it is making my brain hurt. 

There is very little real content here. The majority of posts I've seen are dramatic and whiney. Mods - I know you are incredibly busy people. Please for the love of god, take control. Establish real rules. Remove posts. Ban people from posting. Again I'm sure you guys do plenty as it is but this subreddit is (in my opinion) an extension of the game. It is a popular place for people to come and discuss it. If I were to base my opinion of the game off the subreddit, I'd assume the entire playerbase is in middle school (there is nothing wrong with younger players, but still). 

Admins - Please add some moderators specifically for the sub if you haven't already. Establish rules as to what can be posted, what can't, and what should be sent straight to you guys (a front page flooded with ""hack reports"" filled with dramatic flame war comment threads is very unappealing). 

Players - This is on you too. Please stop shitposting. Nobody cares that you're leaving MineZ forever because you were banned. Nobody cares that you totally caught someone saying ""faggot"" in chat at 10 frames per second with ManyCam. These are things that you send to the admins, not post here to make the game look bad. Lets actually talk about the game for once. And by the way, there are enough LPs of this game. We know you want to share your video but the cold hard truth is if you're under the age of 16 and play on short render distance at 10 FPS with a built-in microphone nobody will want to watch you. Bring back actual content, guys. Talk about the game. Talk about your crazy fights and sweet loot and your strategies and future ideas or suggestions. 


I know that the ""this sub is bad"" circlejerk is getting out of control but it is a serious issue. A game's community and metagame is often just as important as the game itself.  I would love to come here and discuss the game but instead I see nothing but complaints and e-drama between clans of preteens.

He is possibly the most loved bandit of all time for not only his skill but for his personality. I can't honestly remember Jerm before my dumbest moment in MineZ. I was trying to get something off of my alt on PvE, but Jerm and james98645 (numbers probably incorrect but I don't care) were trying to steal the items. Genius me decides to go to a private server where my friend and I are followed by Jerm and james. They killed both of us quite easily, and I lost a lot of goodies. My first experience with Jerm was a learning one, for which I am thankful for. Jerm even gave some of the items back when he learned I was holding them for a friend.

I never played with Jerm really besides during Tetraporc's quest. Jerm doesn't talk, so I have never done so. Everything I know about Jerm has been in talking to him in MineZ or on the reddit. He is more than a cool guy to me. He seems wise yet fresh at the same time. A leader and a follower, or maybe just someone better left to their own devices. My only problem is that I only know him as Jermin8or. Who is he really? I don't know, and I don't think he wants us to.

Jerm has earned my respect for being a true player. He plays how he wants because it is fun, but he doesn't go out of his way to ruin the game for others. My respect for him was why I got him platinum. I couldn't find a more worthy player for it. Thank you Jermin8or. Keep playing and keep being you.

The last time I had been here was my first run of MineZ, where it took me ages to figure my way to it and was briefly killed by a bandit upon arrival. 

I assumed this time it would be different as I didn't see a single person in the town. Never been there, so I explored the city. Interestingly, it was mainly zombie free; very quiet. I rummaged through the chests and was rather disappointed by the lack of good loot. The disappointment was quickly cancelled out by the fact that I had finally gotten here, a spot which I had only once traveled to before.

As I rearranged my inventory something red popped up and scrolled up the chat. I froze in horror.

""Sounds like someone is nearby""

I heard the slow steps of gravel approaching. I pressed E to close my inventory and went down to meet him.

""Hello""

""Hello""

""Are you here to kill me?"" I asked, nervously

""Of course"" he responded.

""Can... can I have a moment? I've never been to city before. Wanna snap some pics.""

There was a moment of silence between us. He equipped his iron sword, enchanted. 

I turned around, snapping more screenshots of Al Hasa.

""Alright, times up."", he took a step towards me and that was the last thing I saw before the minecraft server disconnect page popped up.

""Disconnected: Logged Out Successfully""

TL:DR: Confronted by a bandit. Gave me a moment to snap pictures of Al Hasa, typed in /logout instead. A second before I was logged out he took a step towards me but it was too late.

People are showing up in spawn and not being restored, there are random little lag spikes, and basically you dun screwed up (He didn't say that last part)""

I grudgingly rolled out of bed at a bright and early 9am after staring at the 10 console outputs until 4:30 this morning like Russel Crowe trying to crack the code. After uploading the previous iteration's plugins, I set smp1 to restart, I didn't even warn the players beforehand. After restarting I initiated the push to the other 9 servers and watched as the status indicators on my phone went green, red, green. 

""there, done."" I mumbled.

I logged into the pubs to see if this alleviated the burden they were experiencing last night, and things looked good! Upon login I was instantly where I had logged out on US2! I moved a bit and dropped an item so I could keep track of whether I was being restored when I hopped tot he next server...the next one took roughly 3 seconds before restoring me, then the next one took 7 seconds...nothing had changed.

It didn't make sense, I spent last night optimizing and reducing database calls and things were sluggish... when I rolled back we didn't see performance resuming it's usual chipper state, then what was the issue? I ran a couple of clock debugs and saw the tick rate hopping anywhere from 15 to 25, why the randomness? Why is it ok immediately after reboot? Why can't I just go back to sleep before work? I began to investigate further, if it wasn't my plugin changes then what else has changed?

Then it hit me: The database! We have the database on a box sporting a RAID 10 array and some sexy bandwidth, which also hosts the web server. I dove a bit deeper into some of the legacy code that we inherited from the original coder behind HcFaction's core plugin that we converted into the MineZ core. Every death is logged to the database in a very detailed fashion. PvP deaths record the victim and the attacker's entire gear set, and it does this in a synchronous fashion. I looked at the database and we have logged 500,000 deaths since July 9th. 500,000 deaths being written from the 10 servers while the website is trying to read and present them to the users, that's got to be locking the database for small periods of time whenever a read occurs... leading to lag spikes when we try to write in a synchronous thread... leading to random lag spikes when there are deaths ranging from .05 seconds to 10 seconds. I have removed all death records older than 24 hours, leaving us with a healthy 100,000. We will look further into this, but there should be a noticeable increase in performance.

**tl;dr** 500,000 deaths, 10 servers, 5 hours of sleep, 1 me. Wiped all records older than 24 hours from the deaths table as I am pretty sure the website stats + the servers were fighting each other for control... will work on it more tonight.

**A point of clarification:** I will not spend my time restoring/TPing players out of spawn who got put there due to the db issues. This is beta and I need to spend this time making sure this kind of stuff doesn't happen after release. If that makes you mad enough to not want to play I am sorry.

&gt; Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my banishment. I shall take no mate, hold no lands, render no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.

**600+ Members have joined the ranks of The Night's Watch!**

Welcome brothers.  I am Lord Commander Navarr.  It has come to my attention that the realm has incurred the wrath of the undead scourge.  As such, I call upon you - brave and valiant members of the realm - to join the brotherhood of the Night's Watch and join the battle against the undead.  Our purpose, if you should accept, is to protect the realm and to provide assistance to those in need.



We will hold two corps, both with specific duties for protecting the realm against the scourge.

* The Rangers

&gt; These brothers of the night's watch shall be armed.  It is their job to protect the realm from the invading scourge, and from those who would aim to damage the realm itself.  

* The Maesters

&gt; These brothers of the night's watch will be provided with medical supplies.  It is their job to heal and provide advise and wisdom.  They will be trained in the arts of healing, and will accompany the rangers on larger missions.  When starting a healing mission, a maester is required to be protected by at least two rangers.

So join me, brothers, in protecting the realm.

If you wish to join the watch, please [sign up using the form on the website.](http://www.minez-nightswatch.com/register)

**Additional Notes:**

* A note to those who do not know the references - the night's watch takes no position regarding the politics of the realm.
* Deserting the watch will be met with a sentence of death (KoS).  If you have good reason to leave, simply use Mod Mail on our [subreddit](/r/TheNightsWatch) asking leave, and so long as you've been a good member of the watch and are leaving on good faith, the council will probably allow your leave without incurring a desertion status.
* The Night's Watch will be cross-server.  PvP &amp; PvE.
* At the suggestion of some users, I've setup the subreddit /r/TheNightsWatch
* Optional!  You can [take the black!](http://navarr.me/taketheblack/), which generates a new skin based on your current one.

Last night Lazer and I were in mumble talking about various things and it dawned on us that with the current developments we've made on another game mode still in production we could be easily re-purpose code into Super Bomber Man.  That's right, Super Bomber Man recreated in Minecraft.  

Lazer probably has another days worth of coding to do, but the bulk of the game was coded pretty quickly.  Essentially it is a first person take on Super Bomber Man.  You spawn randomly in a grid style play area with the ability to place bombs.  The bombs will blow up adjacent blocks and there are power-ups (more bombs, bigger flame, etc) to collect.  On top of that, we are showcasing our very advanced third person mode.  By pressing Q (or whatever drop item is binded to) you shoot above your player and can control yourself completely by left clicking to move and right clicking to place a bomb.  Press Q again and you'll shoot back into first person.

The first person view is really where you will want to spend your time, but moving to third person is great for a quick tactical look at the map.  I imagine some players will master the third person mode and play with it exclusively, but it does take a little bit of getting used to.

When we first had the idea last night I was thinking an entirely third person game mode, but it actually is more fun in first person.  It makes for a very unique bomberman-style experience.  The beauty of this is that bomberman is a pretty straight forward game mode, so we will finish this up (more powerups such as the viruses, invis, kicking, throwing, and possibly a tournament mode) and call it one of our first ""Arcade"" style game modes (although DBV is in the same style).

Playing with friends can sometimes be a pain. Getting in the same server and same team can be annoying. My idea is a shotbow friends list. Upon joining the game you are sent a message like (This could also be seen with /friends on any server):

**Welcome to Shotbow!**

Friends Online:

lazertester | EUSBGames_02 | Xp: xxxxxxx

HighlifeTTU | EUSMASH_06 | Xp: xxxxxxx

This simple piece of information would help a lot. You know if they are playing a game, what server they are on, and how much shotbow xp they have. The reason I include shotbow xp is because some people including me like to have competitions friends to see who can get the most xp.

This would be very helpful but I think it would be great if they could take it further.

Ok so you now know what server they are on but maybe you are in a server already and don't want to go to the hub. If you use the command /friends join [FRIENDNAME] it would teleport you to correct server and if it was Wasted or Annihilation join their team or GhostCraft and Smash teleport you to their arena. This would also send a message to the friend saying:

[PLAYERNAME] has joined you! 

The way you would add friends would be a simple:

**/friends add [PLAYERNAME]**

EDIT: Other player has to type **/friends accept** to confirm the friend request.

and remove friends with:

**/friends remove [PLAYERNAME]**

Thanks for considering my idea. Feedback is welcome!

EDIT: After reading comments I believe it would be a good idea to limit the amount of friends non premium users can have to about 5 and premiums to 30.

I know I said the last map update was the final update, but I went ahead and did one more.  What did I do exactly?

* More western land.  This should give some cushion between the world border and Grimdale.  This also means I can add a few more spawn points, meaning we are spreading out the starting spawning again.  This should help a bit with spawn camping and any ""cramped"" feeling.

* The dangerous north.  Someone last night said volcano.  I thought about volcanos.  Now there is a volcano.  The increase to the north added a new style of land, very harsh and rocky land mass with lava, a giant volcano, and much more.  The terrain is INCREDIBLY hard to transverse.  It is jagged, and you will need a lot of food due to the jumping.  This area will likely hold some of the more ""end game"" locations... and I wouldn't be surprised if we see a more dangerous type of zombie there soon.

The volcano area was built with world painter, and definitely needs a lot of hand touching.  Nicola is working hard with voxel sniper to take it from nifty to awesome.  If you venture up there be aware we will need some time to really make it shine.  There won't be much at the moment, so I would caution to on even entering this terrain until we start encouraging folks to explore it.  Expect some neat stuff from this terrain.  

This is without a doubt the final map update before release.  We are pretty confident we will hit the mid-July release date, and are hoping to spend the next couple of weeks focused entirely on world building, bug squashing, and adding in little features here and there.  This should handle 150 players.  The server performance is showing we can probably get this up to 200 or more, but if we keep adding to the map we have to push back release.  So for now we are sticking to 150 players and this map size.

**What is coming?**

Lazer and I have been hard at work on bug squashing.  Him more than me.  We think we've nailed most of the major bugs now, and at this point we are looking to squash the remaining bugs that cause crashes.  Outside of bugs though, here are the final things we are working on prior to release (subject to change).

1. Fully fleshed out achievement system.  Also, there will be difficult achievements that when awarded give you a bonus.  For example, if you kill 10,000 zombies total and 200 in a single life, we might give you a stone sword when you spawn versus a wooden sword.  There will be a number of these that give little perks to you as you start your next life, and give you something to work towards as you are playing.  

2. Integration of a number of elements on the website.  This includes a character page that details all of your stats, acheivements, and badges.  There will also be leader boards based on certain stats on a global basis.

3. Backend work.  We are currently moving all the whitelist handling and what not to the database, and will begin testing persistence with the database being located far from the actual server.

4. Open up two more test servers (total of four).  We would like to have four running smoothly and begin to see database performance before we start preparing for the public release.  Coinciding with this we will start having scheduled stress tests for players to hop on and join for a limited time without buying pre-release access.

5. European test server.  Yeah, you heard me right.  We listened.

6. PvE server.  There will likely only be one of these, and it will not be persistent with the other PvP servers.  However, this server will have a much higher zombie count, meaning you WILL need teamwork to succeed.  This server will likely not be public on release, but will be available to those of you who have purchased early access.  If this variation becomes popular, we may expand it and have a public offering.

7. ???? Yeah, I'm a jerk.  Teaser incoming.  If time permits outside bug squashing we've got some very cool ideas I'd like to see rolled out before release.  If not, you'll see some great things in the first scheduled update to the mod.  Think settlements, mining resources, and being able to work as a team to try to have a little safe haven in the world.  Of course, anything that we put in that allows you to be ""safe"" will take team work, lots of coordination, and require work to maintain.  ;)

**Final Thoughts**

We appreciate your support.  The amount of people enjoying the pre-release version of the game has been a driving force.  We've been working nearly non-stop with little sleep to keep feeding you guys updates, bug fixes, and more stable performance.  It is worth it though.

1364403391.0,42,self.MineZ,1b4ar0,A Quick Reminder: You will not get unbanned for instant log or duping.  Ever.,HighlifeTTU,45,3,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/1b4ar0/a_quick_reminder_you_will_not_get_unbanned_for/,"We've cracked down very heavy on dupers and instant loggers recently.  The admin team has been reviewing the report a hacker claims and watching those players who are getting multiple reports.  As a result, we've banned around 50 people over the last few weeks for duping or instant logging.  Now these people are sending me emails asking for a ban appeal.

Let me be very clear here.  **You will not get unbanned if you are caught for these things.**  It takes us a ton of time to track you down, and as a result you will not get a second chance.  The only time you will get a ban appeal is if I determine lag to be the cause of your ban, which as of the last few weeks shouldn't happen.  The servers are running great, so there is no reason you should be triggering the anti-cheat systems.

Let me make another quick point, **it doesn't matter if your friend was using your account when you got banned.**  I cannot tell who is utilizing the account, so when a ban is issued it is on the account, not the person.  If you have a weak account password or you are letting your friend use your account, you are taking a very big risk.  

If you are using an instant logging bug, I urge you to report it so we can figure out how to prevent it.  Same goes with duping.  We do go through video evidence posted on the subreddit, we do investigate those people in the report a hacker forum, and we will eventually catch you doing it and ban you.  Permanently.

Hate to be harsh this morning, but there are no second chances.

I pretty much always play on the PvE server, RP is more my thing. However, I'm starting to notice more and more players joining the PvE server briefly from a PvP server escaping death from bandits or zombies. While skulking around Crowmure, there were several different instances that players would log into the area and ask for healing. Few of them mentioned that they joined specifically to escape death, heal, prepare and return to PvP in strong force. Outside of escaping PvP, there are numerous conversations of players hunting good loot with players in PvE (obviously with safety in numbers and absolutely no fun in the risk of bandits) only so they can prepare and zone into public PvP servers in the coastal towns and wilderness and become a bandit. This is giving players unfair advantages over new spawning players or those that play legitimately with the risk/reward of gaining loot on a PvP server only.

**Tl;dr** Have separate inventories for PvE and PvP servers.

*Edit:* Just to clarify. I'm aware that PvE has a tougher AI in general as compared to PvP, however, I personally find it still very easy. It's more difficult to get started in PvE with the increased count and ferocity of zombies, but after some easily obtainable great loot from low populated PvE servers, it becomes incredibly easy. You can easily expect to roll into a town and pilfer a few health potions from the church and raid the cookies in the cookie jar because nobody else is there to do it. So part of the ease in PvE is the population. I'm also aware that they're going to release wolf packs soon which I think will be great addition. Having tougher wolf packs + tougher zombies will make PvE hopefully less desirable for a server to collect loot from and then roll into more populated PvP servers and ""pwn noobs"".",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1345236651.0,,steve format,True,t3_ydovx,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/ydovx/suggestion_separate_inventories_for_pve_and_pvp/,

http://i.imgur.com/KRKWwPN.jpg

turned into this:

http://i.imgur.com/Dowzrky.png

this is a solution to the imaginary complaining about minez not having guns, without having to ruin the medieval theme of minez and not costing too much money to host.

how does it work you ask?

here are the main concepts of this gamemode

**waves**

zombie survival is separated in 6 waves (this can be shortened if highlife doesnt want long games.) the game starts with wave 0, which lasts 60 seconds and has no zombies, to allow players to cade and buy their weapons. each wave more zombie types are unlocked and in between waves, players can purchase items from store crates. the players win the game if they survive throughout all 6 waves, and the highest contributors get more xp. the zombies win if they kill all the players, and the zombies with the most kills get more xp.

**zombies**

there are multiple zombie types in this gamemode, and they are all controlled by dead players. players get money if they kill zombies. a minute after the game starts, three random players are picked to become zombies, and they start out as normal zombies. when a zombie kills a player, a zombie controlled by the killed player spawns where he died. here are the multiple zombie types:

* normal zombie: same damage as minez zombie. has constant mining fatigue and speed  but cannot sprint. unlocked at wave 1

* wraith: has enough damage to take an unarmored player to 3 hearts with one hit, but is instantly killed by any form of damage. has constant mining fatigue and invisibility but cannot sprint. unlocks at wave 2

* fast zombie: half the damage and health of a normal zombie. has constant speed 2 and can sprint. cannot instant-break cade blocks. unlocked at wave 3

* poison slinger: has half the health of a normal zombie but fists do no damage to cades or players. instead of traditional hitting, it has a right click poison spit that applies slowness 5 to the poison slinger for 4 seconds, then fires a snowball at a player and gives them poison 1 and nausea 2 for 8 seconds. unlocks at wave 4

* knight: does the same damage as a minez zombie. has decreased mining fatigue, iron armor, and slowness 2. unlocks at wave 5.

**[cading](http://i.imgur.com/MiWfPqf.png)**

in order to survive the zombie apocalypse, you have to collect props from around the map and pile them in front of the door and *god fucking bless you, you sorry dead motherfucker*. this mechanic would work by allowing players to instant break any compatible blocks and put them at the place of their choosing. players may only carry one block at a time and the block must be bolted(see **reinforcement**) for you to survive, or else the zombies are just going to hit it for 30 seconds then it'll break. after a zombie has damaged a block used for cading, it no longer instant breaks nor drops a block for non-zombies.

**[loadout](http://i.imgur.com/kdTlmUl.png)**

all players start with $100 and have access to the loadout store until the zombies spawn. in the loadout store players can purchase guns and melee weapons and other miscellaneous items to suit their playstyle. debuffs may be activated in exchange for money and buffs may be purchased with money. both debuffs and buffs are constantly applied if bought. players will have to confirm their purchase before leaving the loadout store or reset their inventory if they feel that theyve made a mistake with their loadout choice. the only guns available in the loadout store are the basic sort of guns(generic sniper, generic pistol, generic smg, etc) and better guns can be purchased later. if players run out of ammo in the middle of defending their base they can...

**[the store crate](http://i.imgur.com/R72XLq0.png) &amp; [the ammo crate](http://i.imgur.com/T1lzI1F.png)**

the store crate allows players to purchase better weapons, extra ammo, and other miscellaneous things. they can be placed down by players but a store crate cannot be 3 blocks near another store crate. everytime a purchase is made in a store crate, 20% of the money spent is given to the owner of the store crate. store crates cannot be bolted and always breaks after 5 hits from a zombie. the store crate can be moved in the same manner as a cade block but shares the property with them in that the store crate can no longer be moved after being damaged by a zombie.

ammo crates give you free ammo for all your weapons once every wave, and only if you have free space in your inventory for more ammo. like store crates, there cant be another ammo crate 3 blocks near an ammo crate.

**[telewatch](http://i.imgur.com/iC0P52b.png) and [telepads](http://i.imgur.com/Bt3sTAB.png)**

the gmod zombie survival gamemode has a feature that allows you to phase through reinforced props, but this phasing effect isn't possible to replicate in minecraft without being too hard to code. however, there's an alternative to this: teleporters. the telewatch is a purchaseable item in the loadout store that, after 10 seconds of standing still, teleports you to a teleporter pad if it's 10 blocks away.
the telewatch can only be used once every wave.

**reinforcement**

in order to strengthen and repair cade blocks, you have to right click the cade block of your choice with a repair tool and that applies a bolt to said block. only one bolt can be applied to a single cade block. a bolt multiplies the health of a prop by 10(regular cade blocks should have health from 5 health to 20 health.). right clicking a bolted block with a repair tool repairs the prop, but it can only be repaired so many times until it breaks. the health of the bolt is constantly damaged and cannot be repaired, but it has 2x the health of the prop. zombies ""instant-break"" bolted cade blocks but it does not actually break. if a prop has 200 health, they have to ""instant-break"" it 200 times for it to break.

here's a diagram to explain

http://i.imgur.com/5LAqMfW.png

**bosses**

at the beginning of every wave(excluding wave 0 and wave 1) a random zombie is picked to become a boss, which is an extra powerful zombie that requires a lot of people to take down. 

list of bosses:

* **envy**: a witch that poisons and weakens people whenever she punches them. when killed, it explodes and applies poison/nausea to anybody unfortunate enough to be near the explosion.

* **gluttony**: a slow zombie pigman that has the ability to vomit poison at players, at the cost of health. killing players gives it more health.

* **sloth**: a copy of gluttony that vomits blood at players causing them to become slow and have mining fatigue. fist attacks have the same effect. killing players turns them into instant-gib copies of sloth.

* **greed**: a villager that, instead of decreasing your health when it hits you, decreases your money instead. if your money runs out due to getting hit by greed, you die. if you have no money and you are hit by greed, it decreases the money of a nearby player. if no survivors have money, greed instantly explodes.

* **pride**: a zombie with highlife's head, a diamond sword, and a full diamond set excluding the helmet. whenever it kills somebody, lightning strikes where the person dies and damages nearby players. 

* **lust**: a creeper that constantly emits hearts and does extra damage to barricades. if it hits another zombie, that zombie becomes another lust. when the next wave begins, all instances of lust are instantly turned into normal zombies.

* **wrath**: a rare boss that is a wither skeleton. its attacks apply the wither effect and sets players on fire. also has the ability to emit a ghast scream that blinds players for 5 seconds. 

**TL;DR**: the gmod zombie survival gamemode ported to minecraft. pretty much the same except for a few changes here and there.

**NOTE:** sorry for the convoluted post. i may edit this later. ask questions if you're confused.

**ADDENDUM**:

**possible premium upgrades &amp; xp shop bonuses**

of course, monetization is a must since this server would just be dead weight if it's not being monetized. here's some ideas for what perks premiums could get and what you could purchase from the shotbow xp shop.

**premium upgrades**

* reserved slot

* immunity to getting randomly picked as a zombie. can be turned off.

* increased starting money???

* special cosmetic effects such as exploding in purple fireworks when you die

* access to premium maps

* achievements

* ability to save starter loadouts? (dont know if this would be too taxing on the server)

**possible purchaseable xp upgrades**

* limited time immunity from getting randomly picked as a zombie. can be turned off.

* access to individual premium maps

* special cosmetic effects

I used to never make it passed Portsmouth or Romero (when I got lucky) and I still sometimes don't.  But here's the thing: all I needed to do was wise up!  Get smart.  Here's my suggestions for you of weary heart:

1. GET REI'S MINIMAP. Then get all of the coordinates for landmarks.  Not only is this one of the few mods that are actually legal for MineZ, it is more than useful.  After getting this you will no longer wander aimlessly till you get hunted down by a savage player or zombie. This alone could increase your success rate exponentially.
2. Once you get a feel for where things are with the coordinates on the minimap, establish the routes you like taking. I usually hit up one small, minimally zed-ridden outpost for food then hit up different places depending on where I spawned like Yawpton or Carnival, etc. It's really just what works for you.
3. Get teammates you can trust.  Though sometimes teammates can be chumps, more often then not they are friendly and only help you in your mission to head northwards.
4. Quit hanging around the southern cities! These cities include Portsmouth, Romero, even Somnia, etc.  Noob bandits will randomly kill you there, and you really only need some food and/or healing potions before you move on.
5. Avoid zombies more often. Because normal zombies in minecraft are easy targets, it's easy to go in with wooden sword blazing but then you're left with a ""You died!"" screen and a shocked look on your face because you just got innihilated by one or two zombels. Crouch, stay low, and dodge em. It's the safest route.
6. Lastly, change your mindset! MineZ is super fun, but it can lead to frustration and frequent rage quits. Tell yourself it's alright to die but always take a break from it when you're getting ticked.

Just remember, in the words of Thomas Jefferson:
""Those who have died in MineZ the most possess the greatest knowledge."" 
You can be a MineZ hero!!!! Now get out there and kick some zombie behind.  Good luck! :)",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,False,,,True,t3_1btpnp,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/1btpnp/for_those_who_always_fail_in_minez/,

So I made a a contraption comprised of 10 BUD switches hooked up to Jukeboxes, that require all to contain discs. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93-74_OjYyc&amp;feature=youtu.be

I have been busy behind the scenes coding up some wizardry but haven't really kept you guys informed of what's actually being done! Here are the recent changes I can remember, I will add more if I can think of them!

- Added option for lootchests to still spawn if a player is around. We will be setting a lot of low level chests to use this to make them ""campable"" for food etc.

- Added Achievements system! I added an achievement system that is so simple, even highlife is able to use it to set up achievements for visiting places, stats, and custom reasons.

- Vastly improved Zombie ai efficiency! It wasn't bad before, but I found some areas where I could throw in crazy optimizations that lower the amount of overhead to run MineZ

- Awesomeized zombie roaming. You have probably noticed that zombies actually roam now. I figured out a few missing pieces and I am happy with the results

- Bleeding/bandages. It sounds like I still have a few things to work out here, but basically you have a 2% chance of bleeding when you take damage. Bleeding will tick 1/2 heart every 45 seconds until you use a bandage (paper) to stop it.

- Login cooldown. Added a cooldown between logging out and logging into another server to prevent server hopping to avoid antilogger death.

- Antilogger synchronization. I made it so if you die on one server then log in on the other the antilogger will kill you and make you respawn.

- Database driven whitelist. This will fix those ""I can get on smp, but not smp2"" issues. The whitelist is being moved to a database so all servers will have their whitelists syncronized.

- Admins can ride flying wolves. I am neither confirming nor denying this is the case...

- Additional stats capturing and persistent stats that do not wipe on death.

- (GraphicH and Rafiki) Harvestable mushrooms, melon, wheat, and disappearing levers/buttons! Rafiki and graphic made a plugin that makes this all possible!

- Other stuff: I am sure I am forgetting a few things... oh well.

Some upcoming changes:

- Chat garblization based on range: going to up the max range, then make a function of that that will garble portions of the message when at different distances.

- Database driven Badge/title/color: Right now we are using permissionsEx to set the player's prefix and suffix for the badges and name coloring. I will move this over for the same reason as the whitelist, it makes more sense to have it centralized and universal to all server than to copy a file to each one every hour or so and make you miss out on your colored name or badge.

- Stop hard crashes: We are being plagued with random crashes that look to be a concurrency issue. I have learned that bukkit is not exactly thread safe, but somehow something I am doing is causing the native code to throw exceptions without my code calling it, as well as hard downs with no useful stack traces etc. If none of that made sense to you: it's broke, needs fixed.

- Bug squashing: Endless bug squashing

Please start with your IGN with the same capitalization as your name in game, followed by the level you upgraded to. I'll ignore *any* post different from that.
 
For example:
 
-----
 
&gt;Majicou, Platinum

-----
 
Amoliski made a script which should make the entire process very quick, provided you follow the example above. Keep useless posts to minimum - in fact, if you don't need a flair GTFO. It will take a bit of time for Reddit to update, so please be patient. :) Request flair again if you don't have it after 48 hours. Look at the table below for ranks.

The new flairs will look a bit different from the old ones, but Amo will fix the CSS later to move all the old flairs to this new system. So for the time being enjoy your dual flair. Feel free to request your ""new"" flair even if you already have one, in fact.

-----
 
Level |Flair |Total Donation Amount
:|:|:|
Silver | [ ](/SilverFlair)| $25
Gold |[ ](/GoldFlair) | $50
Platinum |[ ](/PlatinumFlair) | $100
Emerald |[ ](/EmeraldFlair) | $250
Obsidian |[ ](/ObsidianFlair) | $500
 
 
The donor flair is *not separate anymore* from your normal user flair. If you change your flair, it will be reset and you'll have to request it again. The flair text should only be ""IGN:username"", as that was the original purpose of it.

No need to upvote this, the big green ""Get your flair"" button redirect here.

Regeneration 2 Splash for 10 seconds(10%)

Instant Health 3(10%)

Instant Health 3 Splash(5%) 

Instant Health 2 (10%) (Suggested by theepicgamer17)

Instant Health 2 Splash (5%) (Suggested by theepicgamer17)

Instant Health 1 (5%) (Suggested by theepicgamer17)

Golden Apple(5%)

Gunpowder(5%)

Shears(15%)(Suggested by Hydrox6)

Bandage(15%)(Suggested by LongrangeDA and Hydrox6)

20% is not in use, so keep the ideas coming.

Instant Health 3s would have to be changed with custom code, cause they heal 8 hearts. The changed pots would give 6 or 7 hearts.

The Instant Health 3s and Regenaration 1s for 10 seconds would all be CUSTOM POTIONS.And before your gonna say it's impossible, please watch this video that Sethbling made:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D8OcQ1zyzY. Thank you for hearing me.

Sure, it may not reap fear into the hearts of full-iron murderers, but the overall pros outweigh the cons.

Here's what I mean...

People are bandits *mainly* for one of three reasons:

* They think that the best way to survive and ultimately thrive is to kill before being killed, to guard their territory, and to not take any unnecessary chances. Instead of spending an hour raiding four different towns to find the loot they're looking for, they can kill ONE person and get health pots, armor, weapons, and other supplies all at once.

* They love PvP, including killing freshly-spawned players with nothing on them to make themselves feel like they're ""so badass"". Or maybe they just want the ""thrill of the kill"". These bandits also kill for gear and supplies.

* Because they want to be a dick and think it's fun to piss off other people or be a troll.

But I have an alternative that can give you the three things listed above and more! THESE are some of the many reasons that bandit hunting is, in my opinion, the better path to choose...

* You still get the PvP thrill, but knowing that your kills are more justified.

* Think about it: you're already on bandits' KoS list. You don't have to piss them off to do that. They'll kill you anyway. You don't have to make any unnecessary enemies when you kill. If anything, you'll be making allies and a good reputation for yourself!

* You can still get good gear and supplies from your kills. In order to be a successful bandit, you'll need to be at least somewhat prepared, so you'll get some kind of material reward.

* Yeah, you can troll. But you get to troll the trolls (or something like that)!

* BONUS: You can feel better knowing you didn't accidentally ruin a new player's experience and drive them from playing MineZ ever again. You know you kept innocent players from dying by bandits. Therefore you have a clear conscience.


So I hope you see my case. I'm sad that there's hardly any bandit hunters in the MineZ world. The ones I see/meet are few and far between. It'd be nice to get together a team if anyone is interested...

Live long and proser, and thank you for reading.

The 6 elemental lords have been unearthed in a legendary tomb but their spirit has been corrupted by some evil magic. I humbly request the help of Night's Watch in this matter! I think I've found a spell to contain them but if they were ever released from their undead form it would be disasterous! What say you Nights Watch - are you up for the fight of your lives?

EDIT (Out of character): This would be an event for all players (or as many as I can hold on 1 server which I believe the max was around 250 people on 1 private server for 1hr). There is no special treatment for Night's Watch - as a player you would be free to kill Night's Watch or the elemental lords. However if Night's Watch is successful in holding off the horde of undead plus the players who choose to be bandits and attack them everyone in the game on all servers will be rewarded. Likewise if Night's Watch fails it will actually affect the game making it harder in certain areas for EVERYONE. So which will you choose - help the Night's Watch slay the undead or will you choose to be a bandit and assassinate the lords even if it will knowingly make the game harder on yourself. This is MineZ - I won't make the choice for you. I just want to give you guys the opportunity to make a difference and actually see it on the map!

EDIT2: Night's Watch is voting on this event this weekend. If approved the event will happen next weekend.

* With the panel of Moderators controlling the whitelist, all participants should submit a character.  They would be committed to living and acting out that character's life until that character dies.  (When the player is killed, their character dies and they are removed from the whitelist until a new character is approved).

* Players should have the ability to choose the town they will spawn in first.  While the primary concern about that would be everyone spawning in a good town, the moderators would be tasked with filtering that out based on good character creation.  If a person is military it makes sense for them to spawn all the way in Crowmure.

* Because Death is very important when roleplaying, it would be unusual and unwise to keep Zombies as strong as they are.  Live's would be very short, and while we all appreciate the difficulty when playing PvP or PvE, the difference in RP would of course be that a person's life is their only one.  In an RP world, I would expect to be able to take on a Zombie one at a time and come out a little bruised but alive.  In MineZ this would probably mean death (at least based on what I experienced last night on beta.*)

Combining these ideas together would make a very interesting roleplaying experience.  It would be fascinating to see how people come together to create stand-in governments and police forces, and attempt survival, in an apacolyptic zombie world.

Should they choose to write in it, they could leave pro-tips and tricks to other players upon their death. Maybe you save someone's life and they agree to be your squire and write the story of your adventure until your death. Its not essential, but it'd be nice if there was some sort of added functionality where, upon your death, your book would be finalized with your name as the author. Or perhaps not, if one wanted to put together a Zombie Survival Guide with multiple authors. 

The main point here is that adding journals to each player's starting inv could only add to the game's awesome levels. I might have tunnel vision, but I don't see any major negatives. What do you guys think?

---

About 18 months ago, I stumbled across a server called HcFactions. I convinced my coworkers to join me and form a faction with some random people I met in game during our lunch breaks. Those lunch breaks turned into late nights, and we got hooked on the intense gameplay that comes with HCF. Fast forward a few months and HighlifeTTU was looking for a developer to make some random stuff. 

I contacted him asking for a project to create for the server, Amoliski responded with a list of projects they wanted to implement and I decided to make a noticeboard plugin for factions. Once I got that to Highlife he asked me ""Can you make an arena plugin?"" and I foolishly responded ""Sure!"". A few weeks of feverish development yielded an arena plugin that was pretty damn awesome if I do say so myself, although anyone who was there knows it was a rocky journey as I struggled to learn the language and the bukkit API (sorry for all the lost stuff!!!).

One night in April or May, Highlife and I had the crazy idea of doing a DayZ style zombie apocalypse server. The next day I showed him fast zombies with some pretty sweet tricks as far as detection and stealth go in minecraft, and he said ""Let's do this"".

I don't remember all of the development process, it was fast, it was furious, and my wife almost slapped me silly due to the amount of time I was spending playing stupid video games :) I don't blame her, really, but she took really good care of me as she saw me get swept up in a newfound passion.

Once we had something solid enough for an alpha, Highlife decided to make an imgur album to show it off. He posted it and waited for feedback on how people felt about it, one week later it had over 10 million views... he and I realized that this might be a little bigger than we had anticipated. We doubled our efforts on development and mapmaking, with many mornings where I would wake up and be surprised at what I had developed the night before.

Our launch was rocky, between server issues, stat wipes, inventory losses, nocheat issues, and lots and lots of unoptimized code it was truly an alpha. Slowly but surely, you all helped us shape MineZ into what it is today. The pace of change has slowed from those initial months, mainly because the audience has grown and every change I make impacts 50-75 thousand players daily. This means I have to be more stringent on what I change and how I change it in order to lessen the negative impact on our players. When I am not as stringent as I should be, I usually hear about it in minutes via forums or reddit posts, angry pms, or staff relaying a combination of the above to me. We still listen and implement community feedback, so feel free to drum up support for your latest hairbrained idea. Just don't get complacent when it isn't implemented in a flat 72 hours :)

---

I won't recount all of the history between MineZ's launch and now right now (maybe for the Shotbow 1 year), but it has been a crazy ride. There are still nights where I don't get any sleep because I am too busy coding something awesome or trying to squash that big bug or exploit that players are spamming me about lately, and I wouldn't trade it for the world!

Thank you, all of you, for making this project a huge success. 
I am especially grateful to those who made videos on this newfangled MineZ thing before we knew that youtube video game videos were a thing. I know many of you discovered MineZ through these videos of the adventures of the huge personalities that we have seen sign in to our servers over these 12 months.

As always, I find myself excited as to what the future holds :)

Sadly, since the Fellowship could only have 9 members,  I had to turn a lot of people down and it was more of a private thing. So this time, I thought I'd do something a little more public: a team-based fight. 

There will be two teams, one red and one green. The green team will be the defenders and the red team will be the attackers. I was thinking we could do it at Stillwater Motte, because I think it looks cool, would look even cooler in a siege and frankly, it could use the publicity. If you have a better suggestion, tell me where and why, and I'll consider it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**RULES**: 

-You can bring any gear you can get your hands on, but you have to wear a dyed leather chest plate (red or lime green, depending which team you are on)

-You can't change teams in the middle of the event

-Once you're dead, you're dead. Don't try to rush back from spawn

-Don't team kill

-If you don't have a green or red dyed chest plate, you will be attacked on sight by both teams

-Keep a good attitude

-No cheating ( hacking, duping, etc.) 

-Attackers, don't log in inside the defenders base. I would like for the whole event to unravel without seeing a single '*Sounds like someone is nearby*' message

-Once the battle is over, members of the winning team, don't start killing each other for loot, those people are your battle-brothers!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Time for some Role playing!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we destroyed the Golden Carrot, we thought that it was over, that we had won, that evil had been defeated for good. The Carrot gone, Adminron the Great was rendered powerless. Little did we know, he was just a servant of an even more powerful and evil force, he was but one of the fingers of the hand of darkness... 

His master has finally stepped out of the shadows and revealed himself to us. His name is Highoth^TTU, and he will stop at nothing until all is ashes and rubble. 


Already his armies march across the land, pillaging and slaughtering all in their path. So many villages burnt down, even more lives destroyed. We have to put an end to this chaos, it is our duty. Which is why I, General Porcius, send out this call to arms to all able bodies, journey to Stillwater Motte, our last standing fortress. If you cannot fight, atleast try and provide our forces with whatever supplies you have. The armies of Highoth^TTU will crash against our stone walls and steel weapons like waves. It is where we will stand, where we will fight, where they will DIE!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If all goes as planned, the battle will take place on Friday the 7^th. At 8:00 PM EST, on US1 public, the green team will start preparing the defenses and at 8:15 PM EST, the red team will launch their assault from Yongton Abbey.

To facilitate communication, I will be on the Shotbow Network Mumble (shotbownetwork.mumble.com port:8809) in the MineZ US1 public room. I hope to see you there, if you are on the green team that is. Red team, I advise you to do the same and pick another room. 

**TIPS**: Green team, bring a lot of webs, as many as you can, and a few buttons.

Red team, bring grenades, iron shovels and grapples, as well as some buttons of your own.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message to any clans or bandits that are thinking of going in there and killing everybody: trying to ruin other people's fun is not fun, it makes a douche, and killing anything that moves does not make you the best at pvp, it makes you a douche. If you are looking to kill stuff, why not participate? There should be plenty of killing and think of all the plunder you'll get...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hope to see you there and to have fun, no matter what the outcome is!

Would you want us to implement the guns from Wasted into some MineZ servers?,HighlifeTTU,61,24,285,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/19f8vl/serious_question_would_you_want_us_to_implement/,"While I love MineZ for its lore and medieval setting, I know that many of you have seen all there is in MineZ.  The guns in Wasted are so phenomenal that there has been mumbling among the team on adding in guns.  When we originally made MineZ, we didn't add guns because we couldn't retexture the game easily and we honestly didn't have the expertise we have now in plugin development.  However, lazer is now a coding god, and the Wasted mod is a result of his impressive skills.

The idea is we would re-purpose some of the MineZ servers to have guns.  Before you speak up, consider that for the last month we haven't had a single point in time where all of the public servers have been full.  This is a way to add some life into MineZ, give players a new experience, and maybe bring back some folks who left because they have experienced all there is to see.  So we would split the community between MineZ vanilla and MineZ guns, but I think it may be for the best.

This is honestly just an idea though.  If there is a huge amount of support behind it, we will do it.  If not, we won't.  I leave this one up to you guys.

Because I like bullet points, here are some additional pros/cons:

PROS:

* Guns
* Combat hacking is eliminated.  No more reach, kill aura, etc.  Switching to guns means there is effectively no way to cheat in combat.
* We can increase zombies and their reach again, allowing for a messy apocalyptic feel that is actually survivable since you have guns.
* Guns

CONS:

* Splits the community.
* No swords
* You will die much quicker and much more suddenly from other players.
* I will kill you with overpowered weapons like the BFG in any beta server because I am evil.",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,False,,developerred format,True,t3_19f8vl,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/19f8vl/serious_question_would_you_want_us_to_implement/,moderator

Is literally on the coast after all. The ladder of the south little tower is now fixed. No more iron here.

**Carnival**  got less military rare gear, so less iron here. The mil_rare on top the windmill was a mil_rare_5 (!), now is a 2. The others are now uncommon since it was a piece of cake to get them - walk in a house, grab loot, get out. No crafting table anymore, and the food is now more of the craftable variety. Also less pots, tier 5 again and turned down to 2.

**Somnia** got the mil_rares on top rearranged. Now is a bit harder to get the best chests, but I'm sure you can handle more fun! Also, no more crafting table here.

**Kaocho** got a new shiny crafting bench.

**The Lost Castle** is now buffed from 9 mil_common to 5 mil_uncommon and 4 mil_rares.

**Yongton Abbey** has the same mil_rares, just in different places. It also now has two civ_hospital chests here, since it is an Abbey after all. No more water here though.

**Aspermont** got the mil_epic moved. It's still in the castle, but not on the throne.

**Zerbia** had it's mil_epic's moved to the higher parts of the tree and the lower quality chests were moved down lower. Also the pond up top was removed to prevent camping.

**Sundawn Observatory** got a buff. If you miss the old Spire, you should check this place out. Every floor now has a mil_rare chest. Food and crafting benches too!

**Bazel** is now buffed with better tiered mil_rares.

**Castle Wayvernia** got buffed with military gear. No more food here, just mil_rares and mil_epics.

**Crowmure** had now way less mil_uncommon, since nobody liked them, and more food. Basically the food that was in Castle Wayvernia is now here.

**Hell Tree** got buffed a bit on the top, and the spawner changed to a regular zombie to balance out with the new zombie update.

**Al Hasa** had it's civ_hospital chests slightly buffed to make up for the lack of food.

Thanks again to Majicou for providing honest player input in these staff decisions. I know you've played this game more than anyone and I appreciate your honest input - especially when you suggest a nerf to the towns you love. 

I'm excited to see people traveling to these long forgotten areas that were long overdue for a balance.  All in all I think people will be happy with these changes. Still a few more areas to improve and might tweak a few of these areas in the future. In particular I'd like to give Loarful Mines some love on the next update. Thanks and happy zombie hunting!

I watched their video and could see several errors that even noobs dont alway make.  

I am a mother with two children (poorman379 and Volante345) and we play together.  You can look up Videos on YouTube by Poorman973 titled Mom, Me in Minez  I don't play other computer games that seem to be popular, so I am NOT a fanatic.  But i love this game and I have noticed the differences with how the Zeds react. 
There is definately a learning curve.  I find the game challenging but doable even without any of the changes everyone seems to be suggesting.  While it takes a few minutes to find each other we have worked out a system. If there was a way to spawn as a team then bandits could do the same giving them strength in numbers taking away any advantage your team would have.  It seems to be relatively easy to get together, once we all know where the others are (we do have skype).  We decide on a central location and work our way toward each other gathering supplies along the way.  If someone is killed we reasses.   Since you alway spawn near the Coast if you dont go inland only a few blocks then you only have to worry about Zeds and People on three sides not four. 

Now here is the hint for team with the bad review, should they try again.  Dont run, sprint, jump or other loud or quick movements to draw attention.  Try to get in a position where zeds can only come at you from one or two directions.  I like corners and the top of stairs or a tree at my back.  Even doorways make it so they have to funnel in. 

Now everyone is going to yell at me but I think it is a BAD idea to have food on spawn.  In my opinion that is just another reason to be killed, so lazy people don't have to look for food. 
 
I guess what I am trying to say is listen to a Mother, you will soon find out we know more than you think.  Send the nay sayers to me I will fix them.

I suggest altering one public server (or adding another server) to be a ""lulz"" server. Its up to you whether private or public, but even as a donator I would prefer public, so more people are on it. This server would have a separate persistence from the others so that you couldnt keep or do any of thefollowing on the actual servers. So, this is what this server should have:

1. Infinite durability on all armour/weapons

2. Potion bug reinstated

3. Chance of diamond armour at the fire shrine (for lulz)

4. Spawn with full leather and stone sword and a stack of cookies

5. No achievements active

6. Giant spawner just outside romero and grimdale and yawpton (oh my)

There are several reasons that I believe this would be a great addition to your set up. For one players who die 6-7 times in a row that would normally ragequit can go have fun for a bit and then return to normal play. Just as much, this would be a kind of ""learning the ropes"" server where utter noobs can get a bit easier play time to get used to the game then join the real community when ready. Overall, I believe this would simply be a fun addition to the server, able to cool rages and break the sometimes monotony* for those of us with (trololol) full diamond sets who have killed everything there is to kill in-game.

I really do hope this gets added, thanks for reading and as a side note I am probably the only person to ever have a full diamond set... and a green name. Lol

""I really wish I had that!"" It is much easier than you may think to acquire one, and I am going to show you how to do it in under an hour.

Suggestions:
 
 * [**Rei's Minimap**](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/482147-131125-aug01-reis-minimap-v32-05/) So you can set waypoints in towns and landmarks.
 
 * [**Optifine**](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/249637-125-optifine-hd-c6-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af-and-much-more/) Better FPS + HD texture packs.
 
 * [**This map**](http://i.imgur.com/F64gB.jpg)
 
 * **Private server**: PvE
 
 * **A team of friends.**

When you spawn in, you will want to make sure your coords are between
-1000 and 1000 on the X axis. If they are not, just drown yourself until you get a spawn that is. This is because they are in walking distance of Portsmouth, which is a great spot to get the basic supplies you will need for your journey. If you spawn at Camp Bell, just grab one round of chests and head west along the coast.

Once arriving in Portsmouth, you will want to get a good amount of supplies. Try for a decent amount of food, (Apples, breadx3, mushroom stews if you aren't too lazy.) 6-7 Instant health II's, 4-5 Water bottles, milk, 2 bandages, and some leather armor if its readily available by the time you have all your other supplies. I'm going to assume you know how to combine your damaged swords and leather armor. By the time your done in Portsmouth, your inventory should look something like [This](http://i.imgur.com/HAPE6.png). If it took more than 15 minutes to gather these supplies I would be surprised.

Now its time to head towards the Spire. It is not that far from Portsmouth, so don't waste your hunger sprinting there. Refer to the [world map](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51913091/MineZ%20Map(Labeled).png) I linked at the top of the page to see exactly where it is. If your too lazy to read the map, walk north of Portsmouth until you hit the river, then just follow it east. You will see a small island with a tall tower. Walk inside the Tower and proceed to jump up the gaps in the stairs until you get to the top. When you get to the top, walk over to the southern edge and sprint jump into the little gap. Camp the chests until you get an inventory similar to [This](http://i.imgur.com/EEwEr.png) Spend $10 so you can have access to the PvE server, it supports the dev's and is 
**Well worth the money.** $10 is a steal for what they offer. This way people wont hop to your server and spam grenades at you. [Its a long way down!](http://i.imgur.com/XmIqX.png) You can either jump off the side, or walk down the steps. Take my advice and walk down the steps.

At this point you have some options of where else to go. These are completely optional and wont help you that much.
 
 * **Ridgevale:** To make splash potions
 
 * **Camp Kharj:** Extra swords/supplies
 
 * **Stonehenge:** Same loot as Spire
 
 * **Pirate ship:** A bit of food

Now you will want to go to **Al Hasa**. (X: 1600 Z: 3000) Open the map linked at the top to see where your going. This is quite a far walk, don't waste your hunger by jumping around and sprinting! After making your way through the gravel wasteland, you will arrive there. Again, I **highly** suggest using a PvE world for this. People in Al Hasa will kill on sight because they are assholes. (Or you could kill them first ;) ) Stock up on apples and Health potion II's, then its time to claim your diamond sword.

Giants will probably kill you the first time you fight them. Why? Because of their stomp. It was recently buffed, so its even more dangerous now! First you'll want to gather your [team.](http://i.imgur.com/XJe8y.png) These can be random people you find in Al Hasa. I wouldn't recommend attacking a giant unless you have at least 4 people, maybe more. Giants do not take damage from Arrows, so don't waste them. Every time you hit the giant, he will orally give birth to 3 zombies, so watch out for that. When he jumps, move diagonally of him and run as fast as you can. They currently have 50 (Correct me if i'm wrong) hearts of damage, and double that on PvE.

Eventually he will die (hopefully not despawn D:) and a diamond sword, Infinity bow, or nothing will pop out of him. [**Victory!**](http://i.imgur.com/XJe8y.png)

**If you liked this guide, be sure to leave a reply! I will also be making some build submissions soon, so watch out for that.**


**TL;DR**

We'll the title can say's it all. All the good builds people put there time into are getting lost in the sub-forum and there are no admins or mods to see their map! I've made 2 maps so far that I've put some time into with my friends and no admin comments down on it. I think these maps people make and I make at least deserve some sort of recognition from a builder or admin! So I'm going to set down links to peoples builds that I believe do belong in MineZ and I would definitively love if you guys check them out!

My Builds
**Z-Corp**: I made this map with a bunch of friends and it may see more modern than the usual scale of builds but I think it may have potential up north with the giants in the stone terrain.
Link: http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/xbxk8/build_suggestion_zcorp_a_factory_ground/

**Phantom Cove**: Me and my friends put a ton of work into this map and it didn't really get that far in the sub-forum. But to be honest with my own build I don't think it can be made into a schematic, but I thought it would be at least worth for a look.
Link:http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/x01j5/build_submission_phantom_cove/

Other Peoples Builds:
**iMartn's Swamp Biome Village**: This is just simply a great build and would look great up in the new swamp biome!
Link: http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/xbeob/build_submission_a_small_destroyed_village_in_the/

**cipeonVIP's Cracked Bunker**: A very detailed and unique build that can really set a strange and bizarre setting in MineZ. Walk across one of these babies and your sure to do good!
Link: http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/xazx9/build_submission_cracked_bunker/

**GhostSniper189's Ghost Barn**: One of may favorites! A great looking build nicely taken screens of it, a great place to find some food possibly?
Link: http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/x88i4/build_submission_ghost_barn/

**manning_upp's Ruined Tower**: Great looking build and totally fits in the MineZ universe. Walking around MineZ and stumbling upon this awesome looking tower can bring joy to the players!
Link: http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/x87l9/build_submission_ruined_tower_now_with_100_less/

**Muggysauro's The Devils Tail**: Awesome parkour challenge to collect those nice goods! ;)
Link: http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/xc874/build_submission_the_devils_tail/

**SharpFlex's The Shire &amp; Lost Woods Shrine**: An awesome build creation that gives you that sense of hope when your walking through a dark and scary forest! One of my favorites cause for some reason reminds me of Lord of the Rings o-o
Link: http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/xcpfa/build_submission_the_shire_lost_woods_shrine/

**Draithian's Desert Outpost**: When you thought there couldn't be anymore added to the desert Draithian builds a fantastic looking outpost with the tools from his sandbox! It may be a little bland at first but with a couple more detail touches and a set in a right area will really make this outpost really pop out!

I wanted to get this out there before I left!)

The MineZ alpha test began on June 17th, 2012, which will be a year ago on Monday.  While Lazer and I had been working on it for a few weeks prior to that, this is what I would consider the birth of MineZ.  It went from a proof of concept to reality with actual testing of the mechanics, construction of the first cities, and the joy of watching people get absolutely murdered by hordes of fast moving zombies.

Here is a little snippet from the email I sent the first test group:

&gt; Welcome to the test group.  First, thank you for your continued
support to the HCFactions server.  Your contributions have allowed us
to expand HCFactions, and many of the mods/code we use there today has
helped us create this new concept in very little time.

&gt; ==========
&gt; What is it?
&gt; ==========

&gt; MineZ is inspired by DayZ.  If you haven't played DayZ, it is a game
focused on survival.  Players start with a basic set of equipment and
must manage their hunger, thirst, and health while avoiding the threat
of zombies and players.  Towns hold basic supplies, your bottles can
be refilled with any water source, and there are more difficult
military installations near the northern part of the map that will
spawn much better gear.  You will die.  Everyone dies.

&gt; The world is indestructible, but you can get/place cactus, cobwebs,
and chests that you find.  These items are destroyed when you break
them, so you can't reuse them.  Since every item in the game, less
arrows, doesn't stack... inventory management is key.  One bread takes
up one space.  Arrows are limited to 15 (a nod to the double stacked
clip of a 9mm).  You'll have to make hard choices on what you want to
carry on you.    Health regen is disabled.  Eating food (besides
zombie meat) restores a half heart.  There are health potions that
spawn in hospital type locations.

&gt; The current test map is 1200x1200.  It is hand painted and built.  For
tonight, the map will be pretty empty... but we'll be working hard on
it while you test the initial mechanics.  The final map will be very
large, making the trip to the best loot require stops at various towns
on the way to refill hunger and thirst.  There is no PvP protection,
but we do try our best to make sure you spawn away from another
player.  This is as hardcore as it gets.  Rafiki is complaining about
the difficulty right now in mumble, so expect to die a ton.  We'll
make it easier if you guys ultimately can't find a good way to
survive.

MineZ is still that same game we envisioned so long ago.  While there have been a ton of additions beyond the initial scope of the alpha, the core features of the alpha remain the most prominent aspects of MineZ.  

Now for some random facts about the start of MineZ before I ramble some more:

* Alpha started June 17th, 2012.
* The first press released was [an imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/a0mV1) on June 21st, 2012.  As of this post, the album has received 13,617,234 views.
* The beta of MineZ began on June 26th, 2012.  At the start of beta we only had one MineZ server.
* When the beta first launched, the servers were pretty unstable.  I used to set an alarm to wake myself up every two hours to reboot any servers that crashed.  I was one tired HighlifeTTU.
* MineZ has been written about on G4TV, Rock Paper Shotgun, Eurogamer, and more.  
* MineZ has had approximately 2.0 million unique players play it.  To put this into perspective, this is roughly 18% of the PC Minecraft player base.  
* MineZ has been played by a ton of youtube personalities.  We've had the pleasure of meeting many of these guys over the last year and I even sang a karaoke duet with Guude (that was embarrassing).
* Lazertester wrote the initial iteration of the current zombie AI in a single evening.  This was his third major java project.  Interesting side note, lazertester had never programmed in java a month prior to MineZ.  He taught himself java in just a few days.
* MineZ had its own [MineCon panel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg-Q5Oyiyoo) last year.  It was an honor to be invited and speak, and we hope to visit MineCon again this year.

So much has happened since a year ago.  We've expanded MineZ beyond its initial feature set, created a ton of new game modes, exploded into one of the largest Minecraft networks out there, and we still aren't done.  All of this success is a credit to you, the players, who came to play MineZ.  Without your support, we wouldn't be where we are today.  While I have very little time to play actual games anymore, I find just as much joy in creating games and watching you, the players, enjoy the many creations now in our network.  I am truly a lucky man to have been involved in such a wonderful project, and I am excited for the future of MineZ and the Shotbow Network.

Over the next couple of weeks the staff will be releasing some great new things to MineZ as a celebration of this one year anniversary, some as early as this weekend.  I, however, won't be able to make it as I will be out of town at a wedding from tonight through next Wednesday.  However, when I return I plan to join the celebration, throw a few wave events, and maybe a few Q&amp;As by stream.  

Thank you to everyone who has played MineZ, supported us, and helped bring the network where it is today.  You guys are the foundation of MineZ and I am humbled every day by the fact you choose to spend your time playing a game that I helped create.  Cheers everyone.

In my time playing this wonderful mod, I've gotten bored with the usual banditry drivel and chose to attempt the game's most dubious task; killing a giant. However, wanting the luxury of getting the resulting loot all to myself, I've taken it upon myself to try to tackle them on my own. 

I've made countless attempts with more failures than not, but truth be told, I've gotten quite the hang of it. So here's the knowledge I've gained from such encounters, and I hope I'll be able to give you folks some ammunition in the form of knowledge, in how to take one of these suckers down.

**Warning**: This guide is *long*, and comprehensive. There is no TL;DR at the end, as killing a giant is a topic that requires comprehensive discussion, and comprehensive tactics. Read at your own risk

My preferred combat location is Al Hasa, as fortifications and health potions are nearby.

Step One: Be well equipped. What this means for you may differ from what it means to me, but before I make the trip to Al Hasa, I make sure my loadout consists of the following:

* 3-4 Water bottles, and plenty of food (4-5 stacks of cookies/bread): you don't want to try to dash back to the well in the heat of battle to take a sip of water. Likewise, you don't want to stop the battle to find food. Usually, however, getting to Al Hasa requires this much water/food, so it's really not for the sake of the giant battle.
* A full-durability iron sword, and a **Smite III, Knockback I Iron Sword**. The latter works wonders on the giant, dishing out that extra damage, and knocking the giant back, so you can get more hits in before it tries to stomp you. You can also clear out the resulting zombies that the giant spawns with relative ease. I usually get one with 1/3 durability at Hell Tree before going to Al Hasa
* No Enderpearls/nades. I found out in my early attempts that these do *not* damage giants, and having them in your inventory is a waste of space. (Note: You can have them *before* coming to Al Hasa, in case you happen upon bandits that are already camped there. But once you confirm you're alone, ditch the nades for...)
* **Health Potions**: These, as many of you know, are literally live savers. After ditching whatever nades I have on me, I make sure potions take their place. In the heat of battle, however, you don't want to be slowing down to take sips, so before going out to fight that giant, I take a few looting cycles around the Al Hasa, preferring to pick up **Splash Health II Potions**. These work wonders because they're not only a good way to heal yourself as you're backpedaling away from the giant, they're also good at damaging the following zombies/giant themselves. Boy, do those suckers take a toll on zed flesh. Any potions *not* throwable are **Instant Health II**. Total potion count is around 10-12 for me. (Note: Golden apples take precious time to eat, and heal slowly. Ditch these in favor of potions).
* Bandages. 3 is a good amount, and should be able to cover any bleeding that might result from your battle.
* An **Enchanted Bow**. While arrows are useless against the giant itself, arrows do wonders at taking out the groups of zombies that end up chasing you. Aim for the head, and most will be one-shot kills, saving your health, and your arrows. As for arrow count, I like to have 5-6 stacks of 15.
* This may go without saying, but a **full suit of Iron Armor, at least half durability**. You want to be as protected as possible. Again, Hell Tree is great for this.

I believe that covers the loadout. Now comes the second, and slightly more important part: the **Tactics**.

This is where I am before I start the battle. I am at the entrance of Al Hasa with the equipment listed above. The giant is a ways beyond the wall. I head out towards him with the enchanted sword drawn. 
What I typically do is get the giant's attention. Get close to it. Once it sees you, start backing away, while facing it. As it gets closer, start swinging at the feet. As the giant takes damage, zombies will spawn around it's stomach, and fall to it's feet, and start chasing you. 

Eventually, what will happen next is what deals the most damage to players; the Giant stomp. The giant will jump, and as it hits the ground, an enormous explosion happens around the feet, dealing many hearts of damage, depending on how close you are to the blast. Additionally, players are thrust backward up to 50 blocks. **Note**: before the giant lands, you want to back away as far as possible. *Just before* the giants' feet touch the ground, **block** with your sword. This will halve the amount of damage you take, putting you in a much more comfortable combat scenario.

Immediately after the blast, examine your surroundings. It's very likely the blast shoved you out of the viewing range of the giant, and it's likely there are anywhere from 3-10 zombies chasing after you from 40 blocks away. Immediately look at your health. It's likely you need a potion, so use one. Next, take aim with your bow, and eliminate whatever zombies are coming your way with well placed headshots.

After they're taken care of, you'll notice that you're very much in the same situation as you were before the battle began; the giant is a bit distant, and you're at full health. One thing *has* changed, and it's the fact that the giant is injured. Look at your hunger/thirst meter and make adjustments as necessary.

So you're going to do it again. Make sure you have plenty (about 4 or so) potions on your hotbar. Approach, aggro, slash at the feet. Perhaps this time, if you take some zombie damage while backpedaling, throw down a potion at your feet; this will injure the chasing zombies/giant, and heal you at the same time. Win/win. 

You'll be blasted again. The giant will get lower on health. You'll heal yourself appropriately. As this battle is happening, try not to stray too far from Al Hasa; you want to have the option of returning to the central tower to obtain more potions, and you don't want that giant despawning after you've worked so hard on it. If you need more potions, get some from the tower after the giant has sent you flying backward and out of it's aggressive range. Rinse/repeat.

After a good 5 minutes of doing this (this happens much faster than I'm describing it) the giant will be low on health. When you land your final blow, there will be quite a few zombies left around. Perhaps 10, or so. You'll want to deal with them before looking around for loot. 

Once that's over, though, you'll get to reap the spoils of your victory! Giants drop lots of rotten flesh, (sometimes) golden apples, and (also *sometimes*, as there are cases when the main goodies don't spawn at all) the Diamond Sword and/or Infinity Bow! Screencap that shit, yo. You worked hard for it.

That's all there really is to it. Though, I will add a note or two:

* When backpedaling, know where you're walking. You don't want to be walking backwards, only to find yourself up against the outer Al Hasa walls, with nowhere to run. Being stomped at point blank is certain death.

* Similarly, if you aren't aware of your surroundings, you may back up against a 1-block-high gravel ridge that needs to be jumped over. *Always be moving backwards*.

- Made giants break any cobweb they get stuck in after a few seconds.

- Added a custom zombie damage and knockback system to allow for some more interesting mechanics when fighting the undead.

- Fixed the slowdown of the zombies when you hit them, compensated by increasing knockback on hit.

- Refactored a lot of the AI to work better with 1.3, reduced processing time of zombies and zombie spawns from ~100ms each time it loops to 5ms.

- Added the groundwork and basic behavior for the next mob, they are scary as hell :)

- Created the groundwork for settlements, but I have set that aside for September most likely due to Highlife adding another 50% to the map and taking my builders away from me :) (Doing the new mob instead)

- Fixed a bug with zombies spawning when a player gets themselves killed while in spawn.

- EnderPearls now destroy nearby cobweb.

- Fixed/Broke Zombie spawning depending on your opinion of the town-based spawning instead of wilderness-based spawning. Many tears have been shed over this by newer players, you'll learn to die with it eventually.

- Added some admin tools, including the ability to ride zombies into battle, because why not?

- Various other tweaks and fixes.

1343441644.0,37,self.MineZ,xa3k2,Hunger and you: A MineZ anti-starvation tutorial,Shiirn,44,7,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/xa3k2/hunger_and_you_a_minez_antistarvation_tutorial/,"Food is the number one resource in MineZ. I'm going to cut to the chase and give a very basic run-down of why this is and how you can maximize the potential of your food.

I'm not very good at being verbose, so I'll head straight into the cutdown info.

There are 4 different numerical values regarding food in Minecraft.

* Level: This is your haunches. This ranges from 0 to 20, 0 causing starvation and 20 being completely full.

* Timer: This is what heals and damages you. Every 8 seconds, if your Level is 0, you get dealt 1 damage. 

Since Healing is not in MineZ, however, we're going to largely ignore the Level and Timers, as you should not keep a completely full or empty hunger bar at any time to play optimally. The next two values are the ones that are VERY IMPORTANT:

* Saturation: This is the hidden variable everyone has trouble with, and I believe is toxic to the game. Saturation is basically a hidden, additional Level bar that you can't see or feel. When eating any sort of food, it adds Saturation on top of the regular Level it gives. Saturation is drained first, which is why you may notice that you tend to drain your bar a lot slower after eating something than after a long time of not eating. This is the most important stat of all. Note that it cannot ever exceed Level, so eating multiple food items at once is very inefficient.

* Exhaustion: This is what causes your food to go down. Every action you take adds some to this variable. When Exhaustion reaches 4.0, it will take away 1 point of food, first from Saturation, and then from Level if saturation is 0.


The math is fairly simple, but I'll put most of it in layman's terms.

What is the most efficient way of covering ground?

Walking. Sprinting uses food 10x faster than walking over the same distance.

Minimizing jumping. Jumping once is the same as covering 20 blocks while walking. Always use half-slabs positioned on the pathways!

Minimize combat. Attacking and taking damage take big chunks away from your hunger. But if you're going to fight, go all the way in - you'll die if you don't do your best.

Always eat **after** you lose a haunch. The most efficient way to maximize saturation is to wait for the visible food bar to go down, and then eat one item, then wait for it to go down. This ensures that you have fully used the saturation level of the food you ate.

Let's look at food quality next.

* Cookies: 1 Level, 0.4 Saturation. Individually, they're the weakest food. A bare snack.
But because you can craft 8 of them, you can have a mini HP potion that also helps your food bar. A full 8 cookies is also the second-most filling ""meal"" available in MineZ, feeding you a total of 11.2 food+saturation.


* Melon: 2 Level, 1.2 Saturation. Good for getting your food bar up, but half as space-efficient as Apples, as they literally give twice the food.


* Apple: 4 Level, 2.4 Saturation. A hearty meal, as far as things go. They're my favorite go-to food since they require no crafting table and are only marginally less space-efficient than cookies (After you crafted them, of course.)


* Mushroom Stew: 8 Level, 9.6 Saturation. Living large. Always try to have at least 3 haunches before eating one of these bad boys, as the saturation level will be wasted if you're below a full bar of hunger (since Saturation cannot exceed the visible value). There's a reason these are so highly valued - they keep you going for an insanely long time.


And down down down down at the bottom: 
Zombie Flesh: 4 level, 0.8 Saturation. This is before possible food poisoning (which we'll go over at the end). Even without poisoning, it's rather sub-par, just barely beating out a melon over all. There's only a 20% chance of eating flesh without getting poisoned.

Now here's the major part of the article:

What is food poisoning?

After eating a piece of zombie flesh, there is an 80% chance you will be inflicted with Hunger. This is a 30-second debuff that, over the course of its duration, will deal 15 points of exhaustion. This is roughly equal to four times the 4.0 tick timer. This means that if you are poisoned, you *will* lose 3.75 hunger, no matter what you do during the duration. **No matter what you do during the duration**. Standing still just makes you feel a bit better because the food bar decreases less actively. No matter what, if you get poisoned by eating a piece of zombie flesh, you essentially ate less than a *single* cookie. This makes zombie flesh by far the least efficient source of food in this mod. It is a completely last-ditch food, that you will hopefully never need if you follow these anti-starvation tips.

Firstly, animals would of course only spawn in more northern areas, and rarely at that. Spawning mainly in the north-western forest would give that vast and rather under-travelled area a bit more purpose, and maybe open up some good possibilities for a few secluded hunting lodges dotted about.

As has also been suggested before, animals would flee from any players they see; they have been living in a zombie apocalypse and have learnt to be wary by now. They could use the zombie visibility AI, but run away rather than towards players they spot.
This would make hunting them a challenge, probably requiring a bow and careful stalking if you don't want to tire yourself out running after them.

Now, raw meat is no good (maybe ~50% chance of food poisoning?), so it must be cooked. Furnaces are common all over the place, so that is not an issue. The main concern is fuel – the two most 'common' fuels would probably be sticks and, post 1.3, wooden swords (although this could encourage spawn-killing, so would have to be carefully considered). Coal would be much rarer, being found primarily in the mines when they are sorted out.
If sticks or coal interferes with possible plans for crafting in the future, there are a number of burnable items that could be used instead, and if I am not mistaken, furnaces are primarily server side, so there could be modification of what can burn and burn rates (e.g. prevent paper from burning).

If both sticks and coal are available for fuel, crafting torches would be possible. However, I feel that torches shouldn't be too much of a problem, giving players a way to leave markings and trails for others. Or, if crafting is not easily controllable server side, they could just be non-placeable.

Half-blocks are your friend.

The graveyard west of Evergreen Manor.

Message to the Developers.,Dellerror,49,13,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/1hx9fc/162_potions_message_to_the_developers/,"Okay seeming that the potions are literally the most horrible part of 1.6.2 now that the sprinting has been fixed. Do you guys as the developers think you can code potions that deliver there old statuses? 

I believe that the potions now will literally ruin the pvping aspect of MineZ for everyone. I tested the Splash I's on HCF which is what it was originally capped at, and they literally do nothing. No point in having them. 

I am asking the developers if they could simply edit the potions codes making them do the original hearts. 

Health II's used to do 6 hearts but now do 4 hearts. With that you'd have to constantly keep drinking Health II's after being shot by a power II as that does 3 hearts of damage.

Health I's used to do 3 hearts but now do 2 hearts. This literally renders them as useless to be honest. They help in no way!


As a long time player that enjoys the pvping aspect of Minecraft and MineZ, please try your hardest to make potions how they worked in 1.5.2!

We quickly dispatched the enemies in the town and secured a rather impressive base that gave us exclusive access to the vendor.  But peaceful times were not to be had, as the server became aware of our plans to hold the city.

So we quickly went to work, using the engineering class to break down  anything that allowed access to our base and collecting all the ammo we could muster.  I peered north and saw the town's tallest building, a 5 story skyscraper.  I knew at that moment my place was atop its roof, giving a second vantage point of the base and spotting enemies when possible.  

First there were just a couple.  Two players trickled in and felt the pain of our bullets.  But our sense of victory faded quickly, as the entire server started to organize.  Within minutes we were calling out contacts from every direction.  My trusty M249 was low on ammo, and I had GuardenGnome ferrying up additional rounds from the shop using his jet pack.  Bodies began to pile up left and right as I moved around the roof, blasting at any enemy who dared to approach the base.

But my time would soon come to an end.  Three enemies started making their way up the skyscraper I had perched myself on top of.  I moved down the stairs floor by floor, hoping to catch them by surprise.  Guarden Gnome flew in from the bottom, and having pinned them from two sides, dispatched the assaulting crew.  Relieved and surprised, I emerged from the second floor to give my buddy Gnome a pat on the back for his job well done.  That is when he turned.  And shot me.  RIP HighlifeTTU.

The quarry is a 2x2 chunk, medieval theme. I built this by hand, block by block. It helps to explains the lore of how Al Hasa became such a rich city, due to the natural resources hidden inside the mountains.

I personally loved the Simoon's song the way it was, and seeing it's legendary powers being nerfed to nothing but, what, a Knockback II, if your lucky? This change made me decide that a rant would be appropriate for this topic.

**What a Legendary Weapon is**

Legendary Weapons are supposed to be overpowered, some more than others and in different ways for different uses for ideal situations. Here's some examples of ways Simoon's song could be used:

- Taking on a large amount of people

- An impolite way to tell people to fuck off

- (The way it was used for) Launching people to oblivion for banditing purposes.

Allow me to elaborate on the way it was used. 

Yes, Simoon's song obviously could easily kill somebody from fall damage. But let's be honest here, most of the time while being used on people during banditing phases it wouldn't have killed someone purely through fall damage. The person who had fallen to Simoon's Song had to either taken damage from zombies, taken arrow shots from their pursuer, had been bleeding, had gotten the infection, or taken damage from his/her's own stupidity. Most of the time the person being perused could recover from the damage taken from the long fall that Simoon's Song propelled them into. The point I'm trying to get across  is that when Simoon's Song had been used during banditing the person falling to it's former effect had to either experienced more fall than usual or had taken previous damage. 

For more elaboration look at [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/1g3o7y/more_op_legendary_weapons/) post.

**The Nerf**

We all knew it was inevitable. We all wanted it as well. But what really pisses me off is how it was done. Nerfs, just like everything else done in MineZ, have all been simple. Nerfs we've seen in the past:

Area Being Nerfed |Reason |Nerf |
:--|:--|:--|
Hell Tree |Too easy to farm iron armor |Spawner |
Death Mansion |Too easy to farm iron armor |Spawner |
Floating Island |Too easy to farm iron armor |Allowed spawned mobs access to the player |

Seriously? Have I been the only one the whole time that has seen this pattern of noncreative nerfs? And now Simoon's Song is another thing to add to the list. Now, I'm all for nerfs but this is getting a bit repetitive.

**The Proposal**

I believe that we should have a much better way to go about nerfing things other than turning it's name into shame. I know this may not be the best idea, but it will allow this legendary item to be considered legendary. 

The Rubber Chestplate. We all know how useless it is. Swords slice through it like butter even though it gives you maximum protection against arrows. I believe that the Rubber Chestplate should take ALL Knockback down to nothing, from swords, punch on bows, Knockback I swords, and most importantly, Simoon's Song. This will both give you a reason to wear the Rubber Chestplate for more than one purpose. This is how I believe nerfs should go about. We have a legendary weapon that is considered OP? Fight fire with fire. Make a new or adding a new effect to legendary weapons to so they can fight among themselves. I believe this would've been a more efficient act of nerfing compared to laying shame to the name of the LEGENDARY sword Simoon's Song. 

**TL;DR:** Simoon's song deserves to be OP. ",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1373818959.0,,,True,t3_1ghdt6,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/1ghdt6/my_thoughts_on_the_simoons_song_nerf/,

I've just recently gotten into the mod. However, I do think a fresh view from an outsider would be interesting to read for many of you. Note that, while I am somewhat new to MineZ, I have played DayZ for a long time and I am not new to hardcore survival games.

Let's start at the beginning. When I started MineZ, my goal was not to become a bandit. I personally wanted to become a healer. Generally, my thinking has not changed. I'm much more of a pacifist, and I will not attack unless attacked. 

From a DayZ player, this method, although not ideal, works much better then expected. In DayZ, it is much easier to take someone out that has better gear then you - a few shots to the head and they're out. However, in MineZ, it is much harder to kill someone in general, and high-level gear is important. In addition to this, far-ranged combat can't kill easily and communications are simple and far-ranged. Coming from DayZ, this allows players to be generally friendly in high-population areas where being a bandit might have less benefits then being a nice person.

I was generally suprised by the amount of friendlies - or people who don't attack at least - in the large population of the southern coast. At least 75% of the people I meet don't mind me - and I don't mind them. This is a large, large percentage, considering the amount of players in MineZ and the percentage of people who are friendly in other games like DayZ.

Then there are the really friendlies. These are the people who are few and far between - they'll help you out, heal you, not bother you, share loot, and generally do a lot of nice things to help other people out. Usually, I find these people attempting to get healer in large towns such as Romero. Occasionally, I find them wandering towards high-food areas such as whitehaven or ridgevale. Generally, they aren't too equppied - which suggests that they die much more then other people. Not suprising. I'd say this makes up 5% or so of the southern population.

Then you have bandits. (Fresh spawn bandits don't count for this) Not the ones that flash the friendly sign first - I'll get to that later. I'm talking about simple bandits that don't decieve other people. Now, I highly, highly applaud the people who do this. Seriously. They are, from what I've seen, a very, VERY small percentage of the population on the southern coast. To be honest, in all my play time, (which, I guess, isn't too much) I have only seen two people who are honest bandits. These people are usually well equppied and are usually good at the game.

And finally, you have the decieving, backstabbing bandits. I'll just put them all in one group here. These make up, I'd say, 10% of the population. They flash the friendly sign, then procede to bash your face in. To be quite honest, I've found these types of people almost annoying - although my opinion might be slightly biased. I mean, it is technically a good tactic. However, I just don't see how these people sleep at night. What suprises me the most, however, is how many of these people there are on the southern coast. They are very, very common, and almost every bandit I see does this. They are usually decently equipped.

Here are some signs that I find expose some of these decieving bandits -
1. Flashing the piece sign, then moving closer with sword out. This is almost a sure sign of banditry. 
2. Flashing a piece sign, then changing their original direction and following you. Also probably a sure sign of banditry.
3. Asking to join you amd following you around. Usually done by newspawns. They do this, then, while you're typing, they stab you in the face.
4. Sprinting towards you. Yeah, this is kinda obvious.

In the times I've been up north, however, the pattern changes. The majority of people up north are well equipped, in a group, and not friendly. For example - I once visited Crowmure, and, thinking it was empty, decided to loot one of the houses. Someone started coming up the stairs. I flashed the friendly sign, said friendly, and backed up. He did the same, then went back down stairs.
""Wow,"" I thought. A friendly person in crowmure? This can't be true! I started typing a thank-you to him for being the first person up in crowmure to not kill me. Half way through my typing, he brings two of his friends upstairs and they procede to bash my face in. 

I have met a total of two friendly people in the north.

Unfortunatley, very little of their constructions remain intact, and along with Hill Azra, the Library of Azrannoch is one of the only know buldings made by the Azrans. The inside is a maze of rows upon rows of dusty and ancient tomes. It is also rumored that a cache of incredibly potent enchanted weapons is hidden somewhere in the library...


This build was made with the intent of providing a novel challenge, as parkour builds, truly, are getting old. The inside is very dimly lit, and maze-like. In total there are five chests, one on the first floor, two on the second, and two more in the [CLASSIFIED]. There is also a complete spiral stair case which gives access to both floors, the [CLASSIFIED], and the upper reading room.  I will leave it to the devs to decide how to fill the chests, but make it reasonable please guys.

Abiding by these rules does not mean that you must enforce them.  If a person you deeply trust does any of the below, adhering to these rules in no way means that you need attack them.  These rules are simply guidelines in order to best establish when it is okay to stop being friendly and attack in order to save your own life.

As stated above, taking any of the below actions will be counted as aggression:

* Running directly towards a player
* Offensively attacking a player
* Approaching a player within a 15 block radius
* Approaching a player with your sword out.
  * As the common signal of peace is to put your swords in defensive motion, it is advised that after you are sure a player has seen you do so, to swap out to a non-harming item such as water or (even better) shears.  Additionally, in order to protect your own life, you should not approach the player while his or her sword is still drawn.
* Following a player (especially off the road)
* Drawing back a bow for any length of time towards a player

Taking any of these actions will be viewed as aggression and your life may be forfeit.

I'm currently constructing a set of 50 rules in MineZ. Now, I don't want to do all the work. I hardly want to do any. Which is where you come in. I want all MineZ redditors to create the other 48 rules. The requirements for the rules are 

* They can't be anything simple. No ""make sure you have food!""

* They can't be anything too complex/long. No ""If you're going to Al Hasa, make sure you spawn in the desert, head to Romero, then Whitehaven, then Frostbane, and always kill zombies with your bow.""

* They need to make sense. This means both in grammar and just in general. No ""Wen go tree under sprint refuse are propar!1""

Let's begin.

1. You're never safe in Yawpton.
2. You're NEVER safe in Yawpton. 
3. Never *fully* trust a stranger from the southern cities.
4. If you got hit by somebody, it was on purpose.
5. If you hit somebody else, it was on purpose.
6. If there's a water source in sight, drink up.
7. If you have two half broken items, repair them.
8. Always fight zombies on uneven terrain.
9. Be conservative with your weapons. Save the best ones for bandits.
10. Walk backwards when fighting multiple zombies.
11. Walk in circles when fighting a single zombie.
12. Don't stop swinging until both the player and the zombie are dead.
13. Inventory management is vital.
14. Headshots are important when sniping zed.
15. Only sprint if you have a deathwish.
16. Always have backup items.
17. Use the [map.](http://i.imgur.com/zatMc.jpg-) 
18. Don't pick fights with zombies that can't see you.
19. Always travel with a buddy, healing each other conserves health potions.
20. Be wary when trading.
21. Don't put bandages or enderpearls next to your bow in your hotbar.
22. If a stranger in a city steps within six blocks of you while staring at you, assume he wants to kill you.
23. If a stranger in the wilderness steps within ten blocks of you while staring at you, assume he wants to kill you.
24. Eat food strategically. Do not waste a loaf of bread if you're missing 1/2 on your hunger bar.
25. Zombie flesh is only useful in large quantities.
26. If you find a new item unseen to MineZ before, it's your job to sacrifice it in the volcano.
27. Groups of people in iron armor down in the south are almost always out to kill you.
28. Never tell strangers your coordinates.
29. Always have two healing items if traveling alone, such as bandages or milk.
30. If you have more than five arrows, don't worry about wasting them. There are always more.
31. Pay attention to chat.
32. Don't try to take out a lone zombie in the wilderness. There are usually 4-5 more waiting to rush you.
33. Romero is full of zombies.
34. If Romero is not full of zombies, it will be as soon as somebody else enters it.
35. When in the wilderness, don't stop moving until you're out of the wilderness.
36. When in doubt, sneak.
37. Come prepared with a button/lever when going to Evergreen Manor. Nobody is going to let you in.
38. Don't attack other people in spawn. You will usually die.
39. The peace sign does not guarantee a thing.
40. Sound can save lives.
41. If you're in a city, give people your unwanted items. Maybe you'll get something good in turn.
42. Don't hack. You will become pregnant. And then you will die.",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1342582217.0,,zombie format,True,t3_woqzx,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/woqzx/the_50_rules_of_minez/,

I sprint and jump for less than a second, and apparently there were 10 zombies a good 60 plus blocks from me. They swarmed, and I died.

So here's a simple suggestion. Make visibilty a gradual change. Don't spike up visibility the instant you start to sprint, and the instant you go to crouch. Make the bar react more slowly and in smaller incriments. That way players can complete a neccesary jump, and if they do it correctly they can avoid trouble.

However, the same works for someone trying to hide from a group of zombies that appears nearby. If they don't crouch and dig into their spots, when they begin to the zombies will have a small period of time to notice this.

Not sure how long the time would be for visibilty to adjust, but I definitly think there needs to be a slight adjustment. Less than a second of sprint/jump should not be enough to summon every zombie to you immediatly.

To narrow down the tiers, there is only a sword and a bow (and other tools, which can be used as a sword). Here's a quick proposal; How about also having axes are fairly common weapons, which have more knockback but less (same as vanilla) hit strength than swords? I'm fairly sure you can have axes have a different knockback amount with just coding, but if not a possibility is even to have them default enchanted with knockback I. 

Second suggestion: Spades (shovels) can stun zombies when hit once or twice, due to their large flat face. Perhaps when hit, a zombie has a 50% chance of being frozen in place for 2-5 seconds? Obviously brainstorming, all numbers are variables up to the developers and balance checks. 

One more: Shears would make a great knife! Maybe used for gutting animals, or as a last resort weapon, or maybe (I don't think it's possible) as a throwable weapon which can be retrieved easily. Perhaps when using a knife as a weapon, it could be ""quieter"" and attract less attention than an axe or sword? Again brainstorming here, but I'd love to see shears as a knife.

I suggest:

1. Make diamond helmets and diamond boots spawn in mil_epics (really rare, no more than 200 dura), or make them a giant drop; buff iron spawns (a little). 


2. Make protection 1 iron armor spawn in mil_epic chests. (rare, low dura), or make them a giant drop.


Also, I know that admins are doing something about the health potion nerf, but by the looks of it, they are making health 3s. But they clearly arent going to make them as common as old health 2s, so better gear will still be needed.

You know in MineZ when you kill someone and it says, for example 'SkillageSkiller MURDERED Knapplace with a STONE AXE'? If you see a message like this you know to avoid the killer,just in case he/she is a bandit. But what if it only said 'Knapplace was MURDERED' and not who killed him or what with? People would have to be more cautious around other players in towns because you can't tell by death messages if they have killed someone.

It would be interesting to see what happens if this is implemented into MineZ, it might increase banditing, but it will also add a level of uncertainty to the game. Was that person who was murdered just now killed by a lucky newspawn or a full-iron bandit? What weapon did he do it with? It would also make betraying people in groups rather interesting, as your group could be in a town, and one of the group kills another member, the rest of the group wouldn't know who did it.

TL'DR: It would be interesting to see what happens if you remove the name of the killer and the item they killed with from PvP death messages.

**EDIT** Lolzboat had an idea, 'I think just saying 'Player was killed' in white letters would work better' this would also be good, for example, if you had a group, and suddenly you see a death message like this, you wouldn't know how the person died, or who they were.",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1363890559.0,,nightswatch format,True,t3_1aq274,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/1aq274/player_kill_death_messages/,

[NAME], I literally want to know what the moments before you got tped and banned look like, walk me through it.

[BANNED USER]


Lazer, i love MineZ, all im asking for is another chance.


[Dev] lazertester

And I am asking you to fess up like a man instead of presuming me a complete moron.

[BANNED USER]


Ok, so me [FRIEND], [FRIEND], And [FRIEND] walked into romero, looking for players to kill, after we came from carmi, [FRIEND] walked into a tower started killing a dude, he ran, [FRIEND] said get him on skype, and Twitch, After that i think it was him i killed by the water wheal object thing, then we fought off zombies, took the loot, and went different ways, then i saw a guy in spawn kit, i attacked him, sprinted towards him, and then he went somewhere, i thought he died by zombies, cause i saw a player die by them on the screen, all of a sudden, a hordes following me, i run away by where you Tp'd to me, and started hitting them, only having 4 hearts, i pulled out a splash 2, and then i got the tp in a whole, where i landed in the side of the stone, then threw a health pot and then logged off.
After that, all i heard was my buddies in skype sayying stuff about they think im banned.

Sorry for causing you this time Lazer, your mod will forever be my favorite, have a good life man &lt;3

Suba did NOT get unbanned for hacks, he had a minimap mod that showed entities and had video proof that it was a misunderstanding, now #@$! off you moronic liar.

[BANNED USER]


I hope someday I can be forgiven.

[BANNED USER]


Anything that gives you a advantage over players = a hack

[Dev] lazertester

No, you know why? Because you had the audacity to waste my time telling me my hard work and dedication were being spent in the wrong place and that I had banned an innocent player. I believed you so I spent my time carrying out this #@$!ing pointless conversation with an entitled 12 year old piece of @%^&amp; only to discover that I should simply stick to ""#@$! Off"" every time i am approached by someone in your apt situation. I was SUPPOSED to finish up the new feature of spawning with friends tonight, but instead I spent my time investigating your ban. You have singlehandedly wasted my time and inconvenienced 427,000 players who deserve the update I was going to roll out.

[BANNED USER]


Lazer here's the truth, I do use forcefield rarely, and I was when you banned me, I thought lieing would get me unbanned, but I realize it was wrong. I know you think I'm a liar, a coward, and pathetic, and indeed I did lie, and it was cowardly and pathetic. I just wanted to tell you that you did a great job coading the plugin to find forcefielders. I hope you continue to develop great plugins like this one. Im indeed sorry for using ANY hack on your servers, and I realize a Unban isent acceptable for my actions.

[Dev] lazertester

I want you to understand this:

I care about this project. I devote more time than I should to making sure it runs smoothly. Every encounter like this that I have with a lying little piece of @%^&amp; who I just banned makes me harder and harder towards players. Your little #@$!ing stunt that means jack diddly @%^&amp; to you is what I have to experience every #@$!ing day when I hit the ban command. I actually gave enough of a @%^&amp; to spend an hour with you, and you would have been #@$!ing lucky to get 5 minutes from any other developer of any other project. Your actions have consequences, and you are dealing with real people. I am now going to bed without finishing the work I looked forward to doing this evening.

[BANNED USER]


That update sounds great, I hope you can successfully do that for all those players, I'm sure everyone in the MineZ commuinity will enjoy that update. I apologize for wasting you time, and now I will as you requested ""#@$! off"" sorry for the trouble.

If you or a friend are banned and do not get any attention at all, this is exactly why. I am no longer buying these stories, ever. I'm done spending my development time trying to help out the scum of the server and am instead going to spend that time livestreaming and developing.

This Minecraft update contains major changes, and with major changes comes pain and suffering. Seriously, if we weren't going through these issues now we would be facing them later. I know it is frustrating and I know it feels like we have been silent on the matter, but the updates and reboots no longer wiping your inventory should attest to the fact that we are working harder than ever to bring you that MineZ fix you crave.

I plan to let 1.3 bake a bit more on the servers, I will keep updating plugins and craftbukkit as often as possible, and we will still count this as free time for those with private server access. If it becomes completely unbearable I will roll back to 1.2.5, but that means the next rollout to 1.3 we will have just delayed the inevitable future of hitting these pain points again. I remind you that the next major update to Minecraft is a long ways off from now so once we get this stable it will be smooth sailing forever!

No weapons, no armour. Only food and health supplies that I would use to aid people in need. I honestly wasn't expecting much, but as we all know, plans never turn out like we intended.

I got killed a number of times, including by someone after I gave them something and was thanked. After that one I was killed several more times until I ended up back in the same town he was in. After making more cookies I gave them to my previous killer once more and was apologised to and asked if I wanted to team up. I accepted and after another of my previous killers turned up and was somewhat rude about it, my new team mate got some vengeance on my behalf. 

From there we went on a marvellous adventure through the desert, forest and snow killing zombies and finding new places to explore and searching to quench our thirst for water and hunger for loot. We helped each other out, shared supplies and when I got stuck in a glitch and attacked by zombies he came to my rescue. We did this until I was bitten and got a very severe case of nausea. We had no milk and kept coming upon places without chests in them. It was a desperate situation.

Eventually we went into the dungeon above the ravine. Finding nothing, and I close to death, instead of letting me die my once-killer decided we'd both hold hands and jump into the lava.

We are going to go work on the next big update to it while you guys enjoy it, with patches here and there as needed. Your stats and achievements from now on will be permanent and loot chests have been balanced, have fun!""(That's pretty much how transition from beta will go considering we have 12 servers up right now...maybe the EU servers as well)

Two days after the rollout we hear back ""OMG MineZ is FULL OF EXPLOITERS"" and ""Wow, I hate playing games that are so imbalanced...this is broken."" and instead of moving on to the next thing we have to fix the exploits that people were afraid to use until new players started rolling in.

I do not want that.

Instead I ask that any exploits found be reported to me, preferably via email minezsmp@gmail.com with a detailed report on how to accomplish it. 

Now, to changes:

- Fixed being able to hop servers to avoid death. (If you have found a way to do this still, please email me with details. This is tricky)

- Fixed craftable items being able to stack higher than we intended.

- Created giants with unique behavior.

- Had a sammich.

Once again I implore you: If you find an exploit please let me know. I would rather you report it than the raging player you just used it on, they tend to be a bit irrational.

* Starting items reduced to a half broken wooden sword and half broken leather chest.  With the reduction to zombie damage, it was still very dangerous but it felt great to finally fill those armor slots rather then start with them.  I liked this change a lot, but please provide feedback.
* Zombie damage reduced from 6 to 4.  This allows a few more hits before dieing.  Still plenty of death to go around.
* Moved the MineZ server to a different dedicated box.  Latency and network issues should be greatly improved until we figure out what is happening with the other dedicated.  The main box runs a 1280v2, one of the fastest Xeon processors available, but there seem to be some OS level issues that are causing network lag and little hiccups.  We are working with the host and hope our monster box is fixed soon.
* Added a main road between the two main coastal cities.  This has helped new players guide themselves to a starting location.  We plan to connect all the major cities with roads soon.
* Added disease.  You have a 1% chance to get infected upon being hit by a zombie.  It is in its very rough form, but going forward it will be contagious to other players.  Right now milk is pretty rare.  I'm waiting to redo the loot tables until a few more elements are added in.
* Added some new cities/landmarks across the map.  I didn't get around to increasing the map size due to some host issues, but plan to do this today or tomorrow.

**Changes Tonight / Tomorrow**

* Further performance optimization.  
* I will begin making a map available online that is static, versus the current dynmap.
* Zombies in armor... WHAT?! We believe we can add armor to the zombies.  For terms of bukkit, its purely cosmetic.  But we can change that.  This is so that as you go up towards more military themed places, the zombies will have pieces of leather armor on them, making them harder to kill.  This will help us scale the difficulty between the coast and the northern settlements.  We are still working out the coding issues with it but it seems possible.
* More roads.  We will also begin populating the roads with abandoned houses and farms, making the common chests containing basic supplies easier to find.
* Improve disease to not carry over on spawn.  Make it so it only drops you down to 7 full hearts versus killing you out right.
* Nocheat tweaks for the snow.  Nocheat is such a love/hate relationship for me.",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1340817672.0,,developerred format,True,t3_vow5p,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/vow5p/6272012_planned_beta_changes_tonight/,moderator

1372441756.0,36,self.MineZ,1h9esz,[Announcement] ZPapz's Scavenger Hunt! (Up-Vote for visibility!),ZPapz96,65,29,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/1h9esz/announcement_zpapzs_scavenger_hunt_upvote_for/,"After weeks of preparation I will be finally hosting my very own scavenger hunt! Before we start i'd like to thank Mr_Darn and Majicou for helping me set up this hunt. Now onto the good stuff, the prize will be 100$ worth of shotbow packages and a BRAND NEW LEGENDARY that not one MineZ player has ever recieved. (whether it be platinum or 4 silver packages.) I have already gotten the green light from Highlife so we are good to go.


Now these are the Rules for the hunt:

-No cheating
-No Pming me for help.
-No cheating


1) This hunt will not be as normal as the previous ones. I have implemented Binary Code. Each clue will come with a group of numbers. (0111010001011000010101) After you have found each clue in order you will have to put all the codes together (IN ORDER) to form a phrase.

Use Google: http://www.roubaixinteractive.com/PlayGround/Binary_Conversion/Binary_to_Text.asp

2) The clues will not be numbered. This is because i do not want people to randomly find clues and then they can just check that one of their list. In order to successfully complete this you will have to find each clue in order.

3) There will be a format in which you will have to submit the evidence to me:

- Each sign will be blank, when you right click them they will display a Pastebin link in chat: http://pastebin.com/tMuMhn1V

- Once you believe you have completed the hunt message **Aoifetheshadows AND ZPapz96** on the Shotbow website with your proof.

- A screenshot of you finding each clue is required: http://gyazo.com/6cf89d55419c30457f5b4b391da7c347

-&gt; The screenshots will have to be exactly like this with these few things needed.

1) The person submitting the evidence will have to be in EVERY screenshot. I say this because i do not want clans to scatter 80 people across the map.

2) The screenshot must be in f5 with the link in the chat. : http://gyazo.com/5f0539d81f5b9b27c4bf00121d336e5a

3) You must type out my name in chat for every clue so i can verify that it is actually you taking the screenshot. : http://gyazo.com/e79bc1c8fee4f9f72e85967a2c6257a6


- Make sure you remember the order in which you found each clue. The Binary Code will only make sense if put together in the right order.

- Even if you submit every picture but you are missing the secret message you will not be declared the victor.

- A screenshot without these prerequisites will not be counted 


I know that this is a lot of info for you to take in but I am giving away 100$ from my own money for this. (and a legendary) I want it to be as hard as possible

The update of the signs will roll out at 3pm EST, I will post the first clue at that time with any info I might have forgotten.

FIRST CLUE: http://pastebin.com/N1JYrh28

**NO DISCLOSING ANY LOCATIONS IN THE REPLY SECTION**


**UPDATE** I am leaving on vacation for 3 weeks on Sunday, AoifeTheShadows will carry on with determining who is the winner. I will give the prize to the winner when I return **or** if I could donate in advance the 100$ and then highlife could manually apply the packages.

Just started playing this week and been having LOTS of fun. Each life all progress is lost but what you learn from the experience. So far every time I start a new life I can get back to where I was in gear / equipment in less and less time.

The first 30 lives, at least, I got nowhere but stuck and soon dead. So much rage. Now, knowing a good portion of the map makes a huge difference.

Anyway, just wanted to say thank you to the huge community that helped make this game possible. I was really worried that the days of the challenging and fun MMO that isn't a Progress Quest was over; so happy to see that it is back!
