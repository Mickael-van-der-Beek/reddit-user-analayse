1356710996.0,71,self.triangle,15krre,Hello r/triangle! I started a distilled spirits company in Durham to make a spiced honey liqueur called Krupnikas. Today is our first day on ABC shelves (in Chapel Hill)!,stormfield,81,10,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/15krre/hello_rtriangle_i_started_a_distilled_spirits/,"Hello reddit folks,

For the past couple years I've been working on starting [The Brothers Vilgalys Spirits Company](http://brothersvilgalys.com/) in my hometown of Durham. Now after lots of red tape and losing a lot of money, we've got our first product on shelves!

I'm making something called Krupnikas, which is a spiced honey liqueur. Our recipe uses local wildflower honey from Vintage Bee Apiaries, a spice reduction made with 16 different whole spices and botanicals, and a neutral spirit (basically vodka) base. The final product is a smooth sipping liqueur that's great on its own, or goes very well in all sorts of cocktails. I wish I could've made it out in time for Christmas, but New Years isn't a bad occasion either, right?

Today is our first day on shelves, so far only in Chapel Hill ABC stores. It might be a while before Durham or Wake County ABC's pick it up, they seem less interested in taking direct shipments and want to go through the state ABC warehouse. But if anyone *hint hint* wants to ask them to carry Brothers Vilgalys Krupnikas, NC Code 66256, it couldn't hurt our chances :)

News and other stuff always goes on my [facebook thing](http://www.facebook.com/BrothersVilgalysSpirits). We have a twitter (@brosvilgalys) but I still don't understand what twitter does, and it makes my writing-major eyes bleed when I look at it. But over the next couple weeks, I'll be doing all the tastings I can manage and trying to get it in local restaurants and bars. 

Happy to answer any questions here, and hope you'll like my booze*! Happy New Years!

-Rim Vilgalys

**Edit: Looks like we sold out on the first day! Thanks to everyone who bought some and I will try to get it back on the shelves over there soon!**

It's called Straw Valley Cafe, and it's address is 5420 Durham-Chapel Hill Blvd. We're technically on DCH Blvd and you can see us from the road, but to get there you have to go on Mt. Moriah and loop around the back.

We are starting our second week in business and really want to get people knowing about us since we're a little off the beaten path. It's a contemporary coffee shop with a bamboo garden, courtyard, back house/lounge, koy pond and live entertainment stage. We sell fair-trade coffee, pastries from a local bakery, wine from NC and Italy and beer. It's a great and beautiful place to come spend an afternoon, study or go on a date. There really isn't any place like it in the area. Our current hours are Tues.-Sat. 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sun. &amp; Mon. 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. We plan on extending our hours from 7 a.m. through 11 p.m. once we get more of a following. You can find us on facebook or follow us on twitter (username StrawValleyCafe).

So, for you, my reddit friends, if you come in any time from today (10/10) through Friday (10/15) and tell the barista you are from reddit, you get free drip coffee. Also, on Nov. 4th, we are hosting a free wine tasting at 6 pm.

Thanks all for reading my long-winded post, I really appreciate it and hope to see you this week!

**Edit** Wow guys! This has only been posted for a day and the number of redditors who've come in along with all the positive feedback and support has really exceeded my expectations! We all really appreciate it over here at the cafe and I hope you grow to love this place as much as we do. Also, we're planning two Halloween parties in the coming weeks (one for children, one for adults), and I will make an official post about that shortly. Until then, keep coming in this week to getcha free coffee!",,False,,t5_2qht2,True,,,True,t3_l71ph,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/l71ph/new_cafe_free_coffee_for_redditors/,

The NC GOP has taken every opportunity to introduce bills this session that are about as right-wing as you can get. They have introduced several bills that made national headlines, and made NC look bad. They have introduced bills that they HAVE to realize are unconstitutional, and will go straight to the courts and cost the taxpayers of NC millions of dollars in court fees. They have made our state a laughing stock of the nation. They have introduced bills to [ban nipples](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/H34), to [reduce](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/H451) the [voting](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S428) [rights](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S666) [of](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S721) [our](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S668) [citizens](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S667), and to [impose a 2-year waiting period for divorce](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S518). They have [arrested peaceful protesters protesting these exact issues](http://www.wral.com/49-arrested-at-moral-monday-protest-at-state-legislature-/12441971). 

This will not do. We need to do something about this. Whether you are republican, democrat, or libertarian, something needs to change. 


So, what can we do about it?

**Run for office. Run as a democrat. Run as a republican. Just run.**


As of 5-13-13, according to the [NC Board of Elections](http://www.ncsbe.gov), there were 6,432,830 registered voters in North Carolina. Breakdown is as follows: 2,764,896 Democrats, 1,982,714 Republicans, 20,126 Libertarians, and 1,664,494 Unaffiliated. Only taking into account the two major parties, the Democrats have ~800,000 more registered voters than the Republicans. With as right-wing as the GOP has been lately, one could speculate that a good portion of the Unaffiliated would vote for the Dems. So why are we in the situation we are currently in? A few reasons.

**People didn’t vote.**

* Not in the numbers they should. 
Of the 7.5 million people old enough to vote, 6.5 million actually registered to do so. Of the 6.5 million voters in NC, only 4.5 million showed up. That was for the Presidential election. The number is disturbingly lower for the 2010 mid-term elections, with only 2.7 Million voting. --[Numbers come from NC BoE](http://www.ncsbe.gov/content.aspx?ID=70)--

**People didn’t run.**




* There were at least [24 seats in the state house](http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2012) where Republicans ran unopposed, and at least [10 state senate seats](http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/North_Carolina_State_Senate_elections,_2012). (It is entirely possible that I missed a few)

**Senate seats where Republicans ran unopposed in the general election of 2012:**

District 6 	– (Jones, Onslow) – Harry Brown (R)

District 10    – (Duplin, Johnston, Samson) – Brent Jackson (R)

District 29 	– (Moore, Randolph) – Jerry Tillman (R)

District 33 	– (Davidson, Montgomery) – Stan Bingham (R)

District 34 	– (Davie, Iredell, Rowan) – Andrew Brock (R)

District 35 	– (Union) – Tommy Tucker (R)

District 36 	– (Cabarrus, Union) – Fletcher Hartsell Jr. (R)

District 41 	– (Mecklenburg) – Jeff Tarte (R)

District 43 	– (Gaston) – Kathy Harrington (R)

District 48 	– (Henderson) – Tom Apodaca (R)

**House seats where Republicans ran unopposed in the general election of 2012:**

District 14	– (Onslow) - George Cleveland (R)

District 15 	– (Onslow) - Phillip Shepard (R)

District 16 	– (Onslow, Pender) - Chris Millis (R)

District 28 	– (Johnston) - James Langdon, Jr. (R) 

District 52 	– (Moore) - James L Boles, Jr (R) 

District 59 	– (Guilford) - Jon Hardister (R) 

District 69 	– (Union) - Dean Arp (R) 

District 70 	– (Randolph) - Patricia Hurley (R) 

District 75 	– (Forsyth) - Donny Lambeth (R) 

District 76 	– (Cabarrus, Rowan) - Carl Ford (R) 

District 81 	– (Davidson) - Rayne Brown (R) 

District 82 	– (Cabarrus) - Larry Pittman (R) 

District 89 	– (Catawba) - Mitchell Setzer (R) 

District 90 	– (Surry, Wilkes) - Sarah Stevens (R) 

District 94 	– (Alleghany, Wilkes) - Jeffrey Elmore (R) 

District 95 	– (Iredell) - C. Robert Brawley (R) 

District 97 	– (Lincoln) - Jason R. Saine (R) 

District 103	 – (Mecklenburg) - Bill Brawley (R) 

District 104	 – (Mecklenburg) - Ruth Samuelson (R)

District 105	 – (Mecklenburg) - Jacqueline Schaffer (R)

District 108	 – (Gaston) - John A Torbett (R) 

District 111	 – (Cleveland) - Tim Moore (R) 

District 117	 – (Henderson) - Chuck McGrady (R) 

District 120	 – (Cherokee, Clay, Graham, Macon) - Roger West (R)	

There are 50 state senate seats and 120 state representative seats available. Yes, you will probably be facing incumbents, and no, you are not guaranteed a win, but **you can be part of a show of force.** Let the NCGA know that we, the people of North Carolina will not stand for this.

You don't have to run for the General Assembly, though. You can always run for Mayor, City Council, or County Commissioner. As long as you run. [Filing for municipal elections begins July 5th, and ends July 19th](http://www.ncsbe.gov/content.aspx?id=61&amp;s=4)

**People aren’t involved enough.**

* I recently went to the Democratic Party Convention for my county. There were, perhaps, 15 people there. That’s it. Granted, I do live in a county that leans Republican, but that seems like little excuse for only 15 people. 

We need more people to get involved. Find a chapter of [Young Democrats](http://www.ydnc.org/) or [Young Republicans](http://www.ncfypr.com/associations.shtml) (If you are under 35 or 40, respectively). [Find your local Democratic Party](http://www.ncdp.org/local/county-party). [Find your local GOP party](http://www.ncgop.org/ncgop-by-county/) (as of this posting, that link is dead).  Go to facebook and look for your county group of the party of your choice, and ask them what you can do. Let them know that you plan on running.

-------

We have an opportunity coming up. We have a chance to tell the right-wing crazies that their legislation is not welcome here. We need to get them out of office. We need to get involved now. A good, albeit slightly dead, place to start is /r/RunForIt. 

2014 is right around the corner.

Lessons Learned..

* Only call or visit once, and when you do schedule a cancellation for an advance date, like the end of the bill cycle.

* I was willing to pay to leave, but thankfully, didn't need to...

* The cancellation triggers a call from the ""redemption team""

* They made some offers, I wanted them to cancel my contract and get my bill under $100 a month, without any additional contracts, they agreed.

* Even if you don't have any another options for internet, or want to cut the cable, you can actually switch to Earthlink directly, same cable internet just lower rates and no contracts

This morning upon approach of others checking speed, this group slowed down, then after about a mile, continued at 85mph. Exit taken was Hammond Rd. Then left onto Rush Street. I'd assume they were going to the NC Highway Patrol Training Center.

This is extremely hypocritical. We all have somewhere to be and are in a rush during our morning commute and just because they drive these cars, doesn't give them the right to abuse the privilege of the position or title they are in. They should be ""protecting and serving"" these roads and the people that drive them rather than handing out speeding tickets to reach their quota. 

What's the best way to get this information into the hands of someone that can do something about this? I've submitted a complaint against one of the SHP cars in question to the North Carolina Department of Crime Control and Public Safety website but I doubt they'll do anything about this because I don't have legitimate proof yet.... but I want to set up my phone as a dash cam so I have it if needed.

What is the best way to contact someone regarding these complaints? Has anyone else noticed this?

I found this girl today on Falls Lake Trail, near the boat ramp off of Falls Lake Road just south of Hwy 98. She's probably a golden retriever/German shepherd mix.

I was walking with my dog up there and she ran up to us. Lots of off-leash dogs on the trails so I assumed the owners were nearby. She came right up to me and was rubbing on me and a bit jumpy but friendly. I walked her down the trail in the direction she came from for about 15 minutes, calling out to anyone. 

As I got a better look at her, she had a number of ticks on her face, around her eyes, and her ears were in rough shape. Pretty obvious she'd been outdoors for a few days.

She has a red collar with no tags. She was taken to a local vet who could not find a microchip. 

I've given her a bath, fed her 2 small portions of food and tons of fresh water. She's got some serious ticks on her underside, I've pulled dozens but she's getting sort of fed up with it. 

I'll be crossposting to craigslist, trianglelostpets, and as many local resources on the web as I can find. 

She's an absolute sweetheart, hoping somehow someone knows someone who knows her family.


Edit: UPDATE Monday 6/17 11:30am

She's at a vet right now getting the ticks removed and cleaned up. My plan is to take her to the Wake Co shelter late this afternoon, they're apparently the only place I can legally take her. 

Edit: UPDATE Monday 6/17 7pm

She's at the Wake Co Animal facility in east Raleigh. Talk about saddest places in the world. I want to vomit now. Hope she makes it, I just couldn't do anything more.

Edit: Update Wednesday 6/19 2:15pm

I sure as hell am and I'm tired of just talking to friends and neighbors about it. I want the legislators to see me, see that yet another North Carolinian disagrees with them. So I'm heading to the GA on Monday. And probably the Monday after that. Ad nauseum until the fuzz cart me away.

 If you would like to join, that would be great. Potentially being arrested doesn't sound fun, but I feel being seen and heard is necessary.

 **Here is the info for parking, etc.** After we see how tomorrow goes and get more info from the ACLU, I will update any necessary info for the subsequent weeks.

 * Parking: The closest deck (which is pay) is off Blount St between Hargett and Morgan on the right side of the street. It is right next to Remedy Diner. If you get to Moore Square, you're too far. There is occassionally on street parking, but if for some unlucky chance the cops get you, you're looking at a hefty parking ticket.

 * The actual address of the GA is 16 West Jones St, 27601. The building is located between W Jones &amp;  W Lane and N Salisbury &amp; N Wilmington. It's across the street from the Museum of Natural Science. I will be outside the building around 8:30 to help orient people as they arrive. By 9:30ish, I would like to be in the ""Press Conference"" room. The speaking there begins around 10am.

 * Attire: It is important that we do not dress like radicals (unless you want to, but that may single you out to the cops). I will be wearing a long flowery type skirt and matching top. My shoes will be black rubber soled shoes in case I have to be dragged out (I know that sounds a bit over the top, but better safe then sorry!).

 * As far as having a specific purpose, I doubt that anyone will talk to us about what we are there to protest other than like minded individuals. There are 5 or so issues that I am taking a stand for and I encourage you to read more about the bills/issues to decide which ones are important to you.

**Edit** - relevant info update

 **Update** - I'm really sorry I didn't post this earlier. I was not arrested. I tried to enter the GA, but was threaten with an assault charge by the guards. Assault is a C2 misdemeanor and I wasn't trying to deal with anything more than C4. However, after talking to some people (including lawyers and seasoned protesters) I learned a lot regarding how charges are processed. So once I hear back from the ACLU, I'll be back in action. 

 Thanks for supporting me!

I have to say this place was impressive.  I don't think I'll ever go to Cafe Driade again.  No, they're not as hip feeling (yet) as Open Eye or Driade, but neither does it feel ""corporate"".  It feels like somebody fused Mod with Japanese Garden with Carolina farmhouse, and somehow this all actually manages to work.  It's a nice place.  It's huge, but broken up into several parts, so no one space feels like you're in a cavern.  Lots of outdoor seating, which they plan to heat in the winter and fall.  

The coffee is good.  Drip is self serve with lots of blends, all from Larry's Beans (based in Raleigh).  At least one employee knows how to make Latte art if that's your thing.  The pastries are excellent.  The chocolates are from Miel Bon Bons in Carrboro (Carr Mill Mall) and are just as fabulous and fresh as they are from the store.  

They have a good selection of local wines and a currently narrow selection of beers (Amstel, Heineken, Saranac), but I overheard them calling distributers of local craft brew, so I expect that'll change quickly.  

It's not Open Eye.  It's not supposed to be.  It takes ""a bit out of the way"" and makes that into a good thing.

I wanted to reach out to the group, see if there would be interest in providing resources to our maker community, and find out what people would like to see. I'm aware of Durham's Splat Space, but what I propose could be another option, perhaps located toward the Raleigh/Wake County side of the Triangle. With help from an outside sponsor, I have the potential ability to provide a laser cutting machine as well as CNC milling. 

One thought that came to mind is a co-working/makerspace hybrid where if you don't necessarily need access to tools, but would have to have a touch down spot to work remotely or meet (an alternative to the coffee shop), then you'd still be welcome. 

Other ideas include having workshops and classes that go further than what TechShop provided. I'd also like to see a strong focus on art projects, which may interest the artisan community.

I've been having some great luck at a lot places nearby and wanted to share my regulars and hear about others.

* [Cary Creative Center](http://www.carycreativecenter.org/) - This place makes me so happy. They collect and sell leftover craft project items for ridiculously cheap. Scrap booking paper? 10 sheets for a quarter. A QUARTER! I've gotten some awesome posters there too, super cheap paint (a quarter for full bottles!) and more. They even have gift bags (I spent $1.34 on 5 gift bags at Christmas and Christmas cards) and office supplies. I could rave about this place forever.

* [Raleigh Flea Market] (http://www.raleighfleamarket.net/) - Dog owners, you can walk them around here! I use it to train my new pup on the leash while looking through vendor items. I have very big hit or miss days here, but it really depends on what you're looking for.

* Goodwills of course, although I've noticed they're getting more expensive.

* Uptown Cheapskate - Very similar to Plato's Closet where they purchase ""in fashion"" and low wear clothing to resell, but they're much higher quality. Locations in Apex and next to NC State.

* [Cause for Paws](http://cfpaws.com/) - I've heard good things about this thrift store but have yet to make it inside. Any opinions?

* Habitat Restore - Locations in Chapel Hill and Raleigh that I'm aware of but I'm sure there are more. Bought a lot of paint from here before, and has a lot of lumber. Occasionally there is furniture but it tends to go quick.

1373566176.0,28,self.triangle,1i3glt,"Noticed lots of questions about moving to area, especially from our neighbor's north of the Mason Dixon. Here's a Guide I wrote a few years ago. Hope you enjoy. Warning: Wall of Text",pinkmanbitch,45,17,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/1i3glt/noticed_lots_of_questions_about_moving_to_area/,"So I'm some sort of a weird hybrid. I have lived in the south my whole life but my Mother is Canadian and my Father's a New Yorker so I feel like I have an outsider's inside perspective on the South and may be of some assistance as you acclimate to your new surroundings.

1. Don't ever ask a Southern how they are doing if you don't have a good 20 minutes to spare. You will get their whole life story. We like to talk and we talk slow.

2. Coleslaw is a condiment here it goes on top of your pulled pork and BBQ is a noun not a verb. We never have BBQs we have cook outs or pig pickins'.

3. When you drive through older neighborhoods people will wave at you. People you don't even know. I'm not sure why this happens. My suggestion is to wave back with all 5 fingers.

4. Always hold doors for other people. This is a must in the South not only because it's polite but because we are all armed.

5. The use of the word ""fixin"" means preparing to do, it does not mean to mend something. As in, ""I'm fixin to go to the store and get me some scratch offs.""

6. It is hot as fuck here in the summer. Like liquid fucking heat. If you have problem with hair frizzies like I do, summer will be your worst enemy. It also happens to be our longest season. Prepare to be drenched in sweat from April until October.

7. When driving around our beautiful rural areas and in need of directions choose your establishment wisely. Ask yourself these questions: How many cars in the parking lot have the following things? 1. Confederate Flags 2. Deer carcasses in the flatbed 3. Harleys with ""The Bitch Fell Off"" stickers If you answered one or more to any of these questions keep driving and consider purchasing a GPS.

8. Tea comes in Sweet or Sweeter here and it's just called Tea if you want an Unsweetened Ice Tea then you are going to need to order it just like that. Be prepared for the perplexed looks when you do request it. Don't even bother asking for hot tea; the waiter's head will explode

9. There is nothing more terrifying or awe inspiring to us Southerners as the occasional snow fall. Your whole town will come to a complete stand still until every single flake has completely melted. It is like a surprise holiday for us.If there is talk of snow go immediately to the grocery store and purchase all the eggs. milk and bread you can lay your hands on. I don't know why. No one has explained this phenomenon to me. But as a Southerner I am duty bound to clear the aisles of Harris Teeter just in case I'm stuck in the house and need to make french toast for everyone in the neighborhood.  Southerners also have a special treat called snow cream that Grandpops like to make. I have never had any but I do know the recipe and will share it with you.
-Take some snow that your dog hasn't peed in
-Put snow in bowl mix with milk and sugar
-Enjoy
Or you could just pour yourself a vodka drink instead which is usually what I opt for when forced to spend the whole day trapped in the house with my family.

10. Southerners pride themselves on being polite. We are a friendly people but just like anywhere there are exceptions to the rule. So it's good to keep a few 4 letter bombs up your sleeve for a rainy day. There is nothing like running into a grumpy redneck and laying him out with a few eff bombs and C U next Tuesdays, especially if you're a girl. This will totally shock and confuse the Poor Beast and you will immediately gain the upper hand in verbal combat.
So in closing Welcome to the South y'all! Have Fun!

Two and a half years ago, we found a puppy. He was shy, he was cute, and he quickly found a home with us. We called him Opie.

We didn't know who Opie's parents were. There are too many feral dogs roaming in our rural county, and we figured that his parents were among this group. 

Then, we started seeing a fairly large reddish dog in the woods around the property. He wouldn't let anyone get close to him, and kept to walking the perimeter. My brother tried for several months to coax him closer, and toward the end of Opie's first summer, he succeeded. This effort was made in the belief that this dog was Opie's father, a pretty fair assessment given some similarities between them.

We dubbed Opie's dad Zeke. Zeke became a fixture around the yard, sleeping under the cars and coming out to be fed. He eventually befriended my brother enough to allow pets. It was at this time that we realized something about Zeke. 

He was, in fact, a *she*. 

And she was pregnant.

And lo, in late July, a litter of similarly adorable puppies was born. We made the decision not to take them to the local shelter as it is a kill facility. We were perfectly confident that we could find homes for these pups. After all, who doesn't love a cute puppy.

But, ah. The recession. We found a home for only one. Which meant we now had: Opie, Sneakers (formerly known as Zeke), and four siblings: Fatty, BoBo, Princess, and Lyddie. Six dogs. That number has grown to eight as unscrupulous neighbors have dumped not one, but TWO bedraggled pit bulls in our yard. I suppose we got a reputation for actually taking care of the animals. 

Herein lies our current situation. My brother, who has taken care of these animals since they were born, must move for work. We have prospective placement for the pit bulls, and my brother will be able to take Opie and Sneakers with him when he moves. I have personally adopted one of the siblings, Lyddie. She's a great dog. Very sweet disposition, loves the cuddle, just like her brothers. 

I have tried, unsuccessfully, over the past year to have these dogs taken into an adoption center. There is literally no room in any no-kill facility between here and GA. We really don't want these dogs to be put down, but we're running out of options. This is not a case of adopting puppies without understanding the work entailed in raising them. It is a case of trying to do the right thing by them and find them homes.

I am appealing to you, Reddit, because I believe that by and large you are a good bunch of people. If you are thinking of adopting an animal, please consider one of these happy boys: BoBo and Fatty. 

They are two years old, vaccinated, and we are happy to have them neutered if you so wish. They are affable, used to being on a leash, and very playful. They are not aggressive, and are house trained. All they want is a good home. We wish they could stay with us, but we just can't keep them anymore. 

If you are interested, please PM me, or respond in the comments. I would be happy to set up a time to introduce you to the boys.

I've heard that excuse a thousand times now and these higher level technicians are telling me I have a specific problem while the local office refuses to fix it. At this point I'm even looking to just drop them entirely. I've looked into Frontier, but their coverage stops just next to my house (North Durham).

tl;dr TWC refuses to fix my problem. Anyone with experience know who to call to get things done or have suggestions for other ISPs?



Edit: Well it is a relief to see I'm not the only one that's having this issue. I'm on the phone with their sales team asking for credit back for this month and a price of only cable if they can't fix this Internet or I'm dropping their service.

Edit 2: well Uverse isn't available at my house so not sure what I'm going to do. I'm am getting ready right now to go down to the local time Warner office and complain. I ask all of you who are also customers to find some time in this next week to go down and complain. They will only solve this if we show that we will not stand for it. The third technician (2 have cancelled on me when I've stayed home waiting) just left and I've already had 3 drops in my Internet. This is just unacceptable.  I've contacted WRAL to let them know and if anyone has any contacts within the company or other news agencies, let's get this story out there.

Edit 3: Complaining has gotten me a month of my bill back at least. Call the sales team 1 (877) 566-4892 or go to the customer service building and push that you want that. Got about 3 supervisors on the issue to try and get someone to fix this. If it isn't by the end of the month I'm switching services.",,False,,t5_2qht2,1342725790.0,,,True,t3_wto35,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/wto35/time_warner_cable_problems/,

I'm 30, female, and live on the [western side of Durham](http://g.co/maps/4sjvr). This past winter, I went through a period of depression (for no particular reason - I kind of suspect it was [SAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder)) and basically let my apartment go to crap. I'd like to find someone willing to help^* get it back in order, and also keep an eye on me to make sure I get back in the right habits again (which I haven't even though I'm feeling better now - I'm not good at making or keeping habits in any case). I'd also like some help getting into the habit of going out and doing things on a regular basis, which I think might help my brain in general - my overall level of functionality has pretty much taken a nosedive since I started working from home three years ago and basically stopped leaving the house except when it's necessary (without an enforced deadline the effort of getting ready makes 'eh, I'll do it later' the more attractive option, even for fun stuff). I think one person could handle both of those - spend one day a week with me, spend the first couple weeks just cleaning, and then check on the place before we go out to do whatever. (I'd certainly prefer dealing with one person vs. two, but if it has to be split up, I can live with that. Also, it could be every two weeks instead of every week, though I'd prefer weekly.)

I don't like crowds or very loud places, and I'm not much into shopping; I do like food and art and plays and low-intensity geeky stuff. I've been considering getting a membership to the local [splatspace](http://splatspace.org/), and could pay for a second one as well if that turns out to be cost-effective, but I haven't actually made it to an open house yet so I don't actually know if it will work at all. I also very much like animals, and have a cat. I don't drive but do live on a bus line and don't object to paying for the occasional taxi.

I am willing to pay for this, though I'm not sure how much would be reasonable, especially for the 'activity buddy' bit, and I'd rather not have someone who's primarily in it for the money anyway... eh. PM me if it sounds interesting, or if you know someone who would be interested, and we'll work something out.

^(*probably boils down to 'do all of it', since I'm not good at cleaning)

**Update:** I've found someone to take care of the initial cleaning, and have a likely candidate lined up for the activity buddy side of things. You can still PM me about the latter, though.

Also, if you are involved with an autism-related organization, and that organization does not actively collaborate with the neurodiversity community or at *least* make a point of having a couple of autistic people (actual autistics, not family members) on its board or equivalent, don't bother PMing me.

I wanted to help her out because she has tried all the dating sites without much success and is getting discouraged.  

She lives in Chapel Hill, has a very relaxed attitude and is socially progressive.  She just loves gardening and has a beautiful garden almost all year round.  She loves to play cards and enjoys going for long walks at home and also in the mountains to check out the fall colors.  It would mean so much to her (and me) if I could help her find someone who she can spend time with (doesn't have to be anything serious, I know she would just enjoy some company at this point).  

Anyway, thought I would give it a shot, it seems the main thing holding people back from finding a partner is just not having a large enough network to meet new people so I wanted to help her out any way I can and I thought Reddit might open some new doors.

We aren't positive she's been dumped but we haven't had any responses yet to our flyers and we've called around to people in the area and they don't know who she belongs to. She's got some arthritis in her hind legs which makes her waddle a little bit so I doubt she ran away and traveled a long distance.

My wife and I have been feeding her and can give her plenty of attention but we just can't take her on as a new pet. We've already a houseful of cats already, one that's prone to seizures, plus a dog so we just don't have the room.

She acts like she is used to being an inside dog so I'm hoping theres someone out there who can take her in. She is very sweet and good natured. Just wants to be rubbed and petted. I don't know what breed she is -- I'm sure she's a mixed breed unless someone can identify and weighs maybe 40-50 pounds.

She has a seizure disorder and other chronic health issues. She has now missed two doses of her medication so it is URGENT that she is found right away.

She was lost near Lap It Up in Durham (NC55 and Sedwick rds, Greenwood Commons). She was last seen in the wooded area behind Triple AAA Insurance and the Secure Care storage center. She could be anywhere in the area now.


She is scared and may run. Call us with her location: 919-455-6001 or 919-818-2949.

Edit: If you find her she needs to go the vet right away! C.A.R.E. for Animals will pay the bill but without her medication she will DIE after today!

Update: Today the hard decision has been made to stop looking for her. She hasn't been spotted since last Thursday and because of her condition it's like she has already passed away. Thank you to anyone who helped spread the word. 

Update 2: She was found! It's really a miracle she didn't have a seizure. She was skinny but happy to be home and is now acting like nothing happened.

Thought I'd post here to see if I can't find the middle ground. I live with my fiance plus three other guys, and most nights consist of buying lots of alcohol and playing board games, League of Legends, Cards Against Humanity, or whatever. Some nights, we go out and hit up a few bars or go to Legends to just laugh and have a good time. 

Anyone here particularly inclined to that sort of fun? We've met plenty of people through work, school, and randomly happening on people at the bar, but we've come shy on finding other drunkards who have the same hobbies as us. I was considering hosting a night of drunken fun + party games at some point as sort of a joint /r/triangle meetup + a way to introduce ourselves to new people and try and make some friends.

Anyone interested? We're all nice people, I swear. Kind of.

Even if I could get him there I'll probably be working overtime at my new job and will end up in a much smaller apartment so it just isn't fair to him to keep him like that. I don't have any family that can watch him and none of my friends can take him either.  I can't bear the thought of taking him to a shelter where he might be put to sleep.

He's a 10 year old shepard/hound mix.  He's housebroken, fixed, and incredibly smart and well behaved.  He's still very energetic and loves to play.  He gets along well with everyone including kids and other dogs. He has never been around cats before and probably wouldn't get along with them.

He's free to a good home as long as I know he'll be loved and treated well. He's overdue for a vet visit by at-least 6 months so he'll probably need to go in soon to get all of his shots. He's always lived inside but is used to having a back yard to play in.

There was a request to have a meetup soon for all those who made it to the Stewart/Colbert rally and I suggested combining it with the next /r/triangle meetup for greater exposure.  

I am planning it for Friday 11/12 starting at 7pm.  I usually like to give more notice than this but I think we should try to hold this one soon while the rally is still fresh in peoples minds.  Also, for the sake of ease and accommodations I have decided to have this one at [City Beverage](http://www.citybeverage-durham.com/) again since;

1) everyone seemed to have a great time the last time we had it here

2) its (roughly) centrally located to the triangle 

3) they have a good amount of indoor and outdoor seating, and 

4) they serve good food and have non-alcoholic options

So, I hope you can attend.  I'm looking forward to hearing rally stories and just catching up in general.

Please help r/triangle.,iphands,25,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/qdzhq/someone_stole_the_bike_my_father_left_me_please/,"Hello, my bike was stolen from my home some time yesterday in the am -I live near Meredith college in Raleigh. The bike was my fathers, he left it to me before passing away. The bike is worth more to me than the dollar amount, I feel like a piece of my heart has been ripped out.

A friend of mine posted a note here: http://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/qbwwd/rraleigh_please_help_find_this_bike/
Some of the facts are wrong in the initial posting, but here is the skinny.

The bike looks like this:

* http://ian.ahands.org/miyata.zip
* http://imgur.com/6TfOx

And its identifying features are:

* Older steel Red Koga Miyata Terra Liner (58cm)
* Black (steel) fork
* Old, black, laced with a black cotton shoe string, B17 brooks saddle
* Campagnolo Record 9s shifters (carbon fiber/black)
* Black, plastic, planet bike fenders
* An aluminium rear rack
* A ""Randunneur USA"" top tube sticker
* Speedplay Frogs pedal system
* A B+M light
* A custom made, one of a kind, light bracket (not fancy, but rather a useful identifier)
* A steel, heavy looking derailleur gaurd (like something you see on wal-mart bikes)
* The seatpost is funny/unique, it is a black Thompson setback, but I flipped it forward because the frame is too big for me (so it is bent forward some).

If bringing a tear to ones eye, or knowing some back story helps for motivation... my Dad is this guy:

* https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=78514#c19
* http://www.adrianhandssociety.com/
* http://www.ahands.org/cycling/pbp2003/fini.html
* http://cycling.ahands.org/

He was a cyclist (casual and randonneur), passionate open source advocate, and all around awesome guy! I love and miss him dearly. The one material thing of his that I cherish most is that 33 pound, one size to big for me red Koga Miyata.

Dad put roughly 10,000 miles a year on the bike. The bike has been a few places, namely:

* PBP - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris%E2%80%93Brest%E2%80%93Paris
* SVS - http://svs-cycling.s5.com/
* The first ever official brevet of China.
* And all over NC.

While he rode it for a number of years (he picked it up circa 2001), he eventually switched to a recumbent because ALS was crippling his hands. He then proceeded to put 1,000s of miles per year on the recumbent until ALS took even that ability away.

Here are pics of the famous Yo Adrian! (my Dad) riding the red Miyata:

* http://imgur.com/ScsP6,jpier,lyOlb,4Uym5#1
* http://imgur.com/ScsP6,jpier,lyOlb,4Uym5#2

Here is his final ride on the bike... here I am carring his ashes in the bag to spread during his funeral. He loved riding so much, his final journey just had to be that way.

This bike is precious to me. I need to ride it again. Please keep an eye out for it if you can. Should you see it please call me and/or the police immediately. Your help is very much appreciated.

Thanks

When you turn us on today, you’ll notice a few changes - 96rock is now Radio 96.1! 

How did we come up with the music mix on Radio 96.1? 

Well, we have to thank YOU for that.   We asked listeners like you, throughout the Triangle, what they wanted to hear on their favorite radio station. The result was a much wider variety of rock music than we ever imagined playing on one radio station. 

You told us you wanted to hear a greater diversity of songs with music spanning from the 80s with artists such as Guns N Roses, REM and John Mellencamp; to 90s music from Nirvana, Gin Blossoms and Green Day, to Classic Rock from Led Zeppelin, Steve Miller Band and Aerosmith and even some newer music by artists like Nickelback and Linkin Park.

You also said you wanted to hear A LOT more music, without a whole bunch of useless talk.  And that's why Radio 96.1 will always deliver ""More Music"" and ""Less Blah Blah Blah.""  Our goal is to make Radio 96.1 the best reflection of your musical tastes and preferences.

So ... give us a listen and tell us how we're doing.  You can call 919-860-9600 or post your thoughts on Facebook.

Thanks again for helping us build a better Radio 96.1.

Suggestions so far are:

* Somewhere we can stand like Loneriders.
* [Frankies](http://www.frankiesfunpark.com/)
* [Sparians](http://www.sparians.com/) or [The Alley](http://www.bowlthealley.com/)
* Board Game Meetup
* [Ambassador Cinemas](http://ambassadorcinemas.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=68)

There was also a suggestion for an /r/dogfort-esque meetup. I was thinking this would be a really cool idea, so I plan to have a separate meetup for this later in January. Hopefully on a warm day.

EDIT (response requested):

So the plan is Saturday we're going bowling. In order to have reservations at Sparians, we have to eat there as well. Playing will be $14 for one game, then $8 for each game after that, food will be about $9-12, assuming you get soda. If we eat and play, it'd probably be 3 hours and $30 minimum. If that's cool with everyone, I can go ahead and book for 7 o'clock for 20 people. I posted a ""Yay for Sparians!"" comment. Upvote/Downvote that. I have RES so I can see both.

If that fails, we'll be going for food in Cameron Village/bowling at The Alley. Or Crossroads/bowling at Buffallo Lanes in Cary. Either way, I'll be making a reservation at 4pm today.

Also, is there anyone who would mind hosting a boardgame/pot luck at their place in February? I can do all the planning, I just need to know we have a place.",,False,,t5_2qht2,True,,,True,t3_ez0zf,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/ez0zf/triangle_meetup/,

Go fill out it out if you're going, regardless of if you'll bring food/gear or not. It's a potluck, so food is appreciated, but not mandatory. There will be grilling equipment there as well as a covered shelter area. 

Remember, this is City of Raleigh land! If you're gonna be boozing do it elsewhere!

Besides acres of very well-kept woods, the park has a large pond that you can ride paddle boats on, a full size carousel, playground, and miniature train that circles the park. All of these close at 9pm. Additionally, there's a small [cafe](http://pullenplace.com/) (closes at 7pm) with a lot of food options.

Crick: She's the smallest of the group but has an alpha mentality. She has a marbled/tortoise shell color with a slightly fluffy coat and yellow eyes. She's not terribly social but makes up for it with her hunting skills. She would make a great farm cat.

(I had been there months ago while my mother was collecting unemployment from being laid off.) The front desk now has walls surrounding it. When I asked the woman behind the counter about it, she said that it was a security measure and that she was supposed to have bulletproof glass in front of her. Apparently when they redid the Cary office, they didn't do it right. 

Durham and Raleigh offices, however, are both correctly done. In fact, not only do they have bulletproof glass dividing them from people on the other side, but they either currently have or will have armed guards. All in anticipation of shit getting real when people find out their extensions on unemployment benefits will be revoked. 

Can anyone tell me more about this?

Two things:

1) The look of the subreddit has had some growing pains, I know.  I wanted to customize it a bit, but after seeing /r/raleigh's cool new looks I realize we still have a ways to go.  I have an actual web designer arranged to help us out (a local guy too), so you can expect to see a sleeker style in a couple of weeks.  Hang on just a little longer.

2) Look out for a /r/triangle subreddit contest of some sort.  I am not yet decided on the exact nature of the contest yet, and I am willing to hear some ideas for you.  The only thing I can tell you is that the winners will receive reddit gold, so get excited!  

That's all for now.  Thanks for reading.  Feel free to leave contest idea  comments, comments about your weekend, or really anything at all.

She (I think, but maybe he) is incredibly sweet and loves attention.  Looks to be pretty young, less than 6 months I'd say, but I'm not very good at guessing that sort of thing.  She also wants desperately to come inside, which is why I think she might have been someone's pet.  Unfortunately I can't let her in because one of the two cats I already have is not friendly with...well, anything, but especially not other cats.  She barely tolerates the cat that she's lived with for almost 10 years now.  I've given her some food and water and she seems to be sleeping in the bushes and in my building.  I live on a busy street but she doesn't seem to be interested in trying to cross it, which is good.

If anyone has lost a cat that looks similar, or if anyone is looking to get a cat please let me know.  I'm going to try to take her to the vet or somewhere this week to see if she's microchipped, and to see how much it'll cost to get her fixed and vaccinated.

Edit: Forgot to add that it seems like this cat would be ok with other cats, but it's hard to say from such short interaction.  Up to the point where my evil cat started hissing at her and growling she was a little curious and a little scared.  She didn't start hissing or growling herself until my cat started it first.  She did so while backing up and getting away, but that doesn't guarantee she's not aggressive.  She probably just realized the angry cat has about 10 pounds on her.

Update: I will be taking her to the vet tomorrow to see if she's got a microchip.  If she doesn't I may have someone who is interested.

Also, more pics [here](http://imgur.com/a/VNUDw).

Update 2: Well, despite normally trying to trip me and following me every step I take (including about 20 minutes before I was trying to find her), when I went to get the cat to go check for the microchip this morning she was hiding.  Anyway, I'm going to try to leave work early today and go before they close.

Update 3: Unfortunately no luck on the microchip and I haven't yet found someone to take in the cat.  I made a makeshift house on my porch out of boxes and towels, so he's warm and out of the rain, but I have to leave town this weekend and it's going to be pretty cold. The plan right now is to take it to the Durham animal shelter either tomorrow or Saturday.  If it's still there when I get back from the holidays I may adopt it.  I figure with supervision my cats will adjust, but there's just no way to do that while I'm not here.  If anyone is interested though please let me know tonight or tomorrow.

She is an absolute sweetheart who is looking for her forever home. She is having a harder time than most puppies we rescue due to her disability. 

The only the background on her we have is that she was thrown over a fence into someone's backyard. When she was found she had little to no control over her back legs. The doctor thinks it was probably some type of birth defect but it could have been a injury when she was very young. She seems to have no pain associated with this injury.

We have had her for a little over a month now and to our amazement she has been getting better and better. She now can stand and even walk a bit on slick hardwood floors. She is still pretty wobbly but we have been amazed at her progress. She will still drag her little butt around when she is in a hurry somewhere but she is very mobile and has tons of puppy energy and love!

The rescue group I work with is based in Rougemont which is a bit north of Durham. Here is a link to the rescue and also a link to Tiger Lily's adoption page.

Subjects must be between ages 18 - 65 years, have 20/20 or corrected vision, be able to set up a 16-foot extension ladder, and have no professional experience using extension ladders.  

Subjects will be compensated at a rate of $10/hour. The study is approximately 1 hour.  

Please call (919) 515-7210 or email ladder.safety.study@gmail.com for more information (email is preferred). 

**Edit** : I just want to thank all of you that have participated so far, you guys are awesome. This has been by far my best source for subjects. For research purposes we like to have our studies balanced for gender (equal men and women subjects) and the guys are doing their part but we need more women to come in for this study. So if you have a spare hour (it's actually about 30-40 mins) and want $10 please contact me so that we can get you to our lab ASAP.  

Also, if you have completed this study and found it to be an easy and enjoyable experience please upvote so that this can be near the top of r/triangle.

I've been lurking a while, but I just purchased a groupon for two (2) [2012-2013 Season Subscriptions to the Chamber Orchestra!](http://www.chamberorchestraofthetriangle.org/tickets.htm), but unfortunately I am only one, and I do not have a significant other to share this experience with (disclaimer: nor am I looking for one at the moment). 

I want to offer two possibilities: first, I would like to offer someone the chance to make a friend by joining me for these six concerts. You needn't feel pressure to become my friend, but I think that it's fairly reasonable to assume that, over the course of a few months and between six concerts, we could have fun and might end up friends. If you are a classically inclined lady, I'd want it to be clear that I do not consider these concerts to be dates!

Second, I would like to offer any of you the chance to purchase my unneeded six tickets from me for $5 each (discounted from $20 per event). It would require us to meet at the box office for me to give you the ticket, but that shouldn't be a problem!

It's been over a month since our last Barcraft, so it's only fitting we return with one of the best yearly tournaments out there. A tournament with a proud heritage as one of the longest running and high quality 'foreigner' tournaments, the TSL is currently in the semi-finals. The mainstays and established winners have all been eliminated, and now's the chance for some brand new players to prove they're worthy of a major tournament win.  

I'll be showing up at 1:30 PM to start setting up the hardware, so feel free to come out a little early and watch some SCII action!

Also, we'll have our SCII Bingo boards courtesy of http://www.facebook.com/SCTuesdays to help people practice their MICRO during the downtime :D

[WSJ Article about Barcraft](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904070604576516462736084234.html) 

**Introduction to Barcraft**

So what is a Barcraft? A Barcraft is an event where you watch StarCraft II competitions in a bar, which may or may not answer the question. StarCraft II is one of the video games at the forefront of ""E-sports"", the rapidly growing world of electronic sports, where professional gamers battle it out in the virtual arena of a video game. 

Now, I know this may sound crazy (I was first introduced to the world of e-sports about 2 years ago, by StarCraft II, and I still find it somewhat unreal), but there are people that are, in fact, 'professional' gamers. Their main source of income is from competing as a pro-gamer, and it is their job - they practice 8-10 hours a day with other pro-gamers and with the aid of their coaches. These gamers almost always belong to a team , which is an organization with all of the same structure you'd expect from any other sports organization, from the owners handling the business aspects to the coaches. It's still in development, and there's still plenty of rough spots, but it is definitely growing and growing fast.

StarCraft II itself is a 'real-time strategy game', which basically means each player is building up an army to try and kill the other guy, and that it happens in real-time (as opposed to turn-based like Chess or Risk). The strategy aspect emphasizes a commanding knowledge of the game and how it works, while the real-time aspect forces high speed and precision (known as APM, or Actions Per Minute). Unlike other games, the player plays a dual-role of both managing their army in battle, as well as building up the army and choosing its composition back at base.",,False,,t5_2qht2,False,,user,True,t3_zc689,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/zc689/sat_98_triangle_barcraft_tsl4_finals/,

So that's what I'm doing. I'm a Raleigh native so I don't know too much about Durham and CH. I need your help filling out the list. The goal is to make a sticky post for people who are visiting or curious about our towns. Here's what we have so far

**RALEIGH**

**Bars**

* **The Big Venue: The Lincoln Theatre** The biggest music bar in Raleigh, though far from the best. They get a really random assortment of bands, from hippie folk to indie rock, it's hard to say what will be at the Lincoln one night to the next. That said, they are the most consistant at booking bands everyone has heard of.
* **The Little Venue: Kings/Neptunes/The Pour House** Kings and Neptunes is split level bar that caters to the indie scene. Not a huge space, but if an up-and-coming act is performing in Raleigh, they are more than likely performing here. If the concert is being put on by the cats cradle, you can bet your ass it's hipster gold. The Pour House is a bit more... hippie? It's got a great scene and works very hard to bring good bands to the triangle.
* **The Townies: Slims/Dive Bar** Both are the hole in the wall bars where you'll get a new best fried and/or stabbed. Slims caters to the local music scene while Dive Bar caters to the heavy metal crowd. Both seem kind of scary from the outside, but are full of very cool people if you've got a thing for townies. 
* **The Gay Bars: The Borough/Legends/Flex** The borough offers LGBT friendly dining. I've never seen that place get crazy nor have I ever felt uncomfortable there for being straight, it's a very friendly experience. Flex and Legends are *very* friendly places, if you catch my meaning. I went to one super drunk and there were drag shows, queens, and much crotch grabbing. Maybe that was just the night I was there, but from what I understand, that's what it's generally like (correct me if I'm wrong)
* **The Beer Garden: Flying Sucer/The Raleigh Times** Both are water holes. The Flying Saucer has hundreds of beers on tap and in bottles, where the Times has a more limited but more interesting selection. Both pride themselves on having ample seating indoors and out, and are great places to mix and mingle. There's not really a specific crowd that haunts either place.
* **I JUST WANT TO DANCE: Mirage/Architecture/Solas/Red Room/The Hive** These are the bars where you go to get down. Loud music and expensive drinks are on order for the evening. If you go to these bars, you know exactly what you're looking for, and you'll find it.
* **Pubs: Tir Na Nog/Landmark Tavern/Mitch's Tavern** Really chill places to get a pint and chill with friends.
* **See and be Scene: Glennwood South/Fayetteville Street** Put on your best outfit, do your hair, and prepare to be judged. Glennwood South and Fayetteville Street are known for their strips of bars. It's a great place to bar hop and you're sure to find the beautiful people here.
* **Billiards/Pool Hall: Buck's Billiards/Snooker's/Pantana Bob's/Sharky's** Although Buck's is technically in Cary it's one of the best place that's close to downtown to play pool, drink decent beer, and be around a good crowd. Snookers is pretty much only centered around Billiards. PB's seems to be as well, granted you tend to get more of the college crowd there prob due to it being on hillsborough st. Oh and there's Sharky's, they just recently came under new ownership and i believe they also have new tables. Talk about great food and drink specials.
* **Munchies: Snoopy's/Char-Grill/Mecca/Most Bars** Bars close at 2 am. at 2:01, everyone goes to Snoopy's and Char-Grill. It's just the greasiest, trashiest, most delicious drunk food you'll be able to get your hands on. Mecca closes when it runs out of food or the cooks feel like cleaning up, but it's worth it to get there early. Great diner food. Most places on this list will serve food (especially the pubs) and most of the food is great.

**Add to this list**

We have museums that are a blast, parks everywhere, and so much more in the Triangle area. Don't focus only on bars and help me add to this list for your town. Thanks!",,False,,t5_2qht2,False,,,True,t3_124qk3,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/124qk3/guide_to_the_triangle/,

  If you're anything like me, you tried learning on your own but messed up often (even in simple things like setting up a dev environment; I'm a Windows user...), didn't have great sense of how to structure the learning and got pretty frustrated. 

  So, I went out and put together an Intro to Ruby on Rails workshop led by awesome local teachers: triangleror.eventbrite.com

  (Use the code, ""YayReddit"" for a discount!)

More info:

  The workshop is designed for eager learners with no previous programming experience, but a lot of passion for building things. The class will be very hands on and you will be able to go at your own pace.

I complied, had a smirk on my face. There is a picture of me clearly in the smoking section when a different cop comes up with a ""I'm going to beat your ass"" look on his face. I asked him where I should go and he told me ""You're coming with me, you think this is fucking funny, lets go I'll fucking throw you out right now"". I'm not embellishing. I'm like 30 years old now with a career at a Lit concert reliving my youth ... I'm not giving anybody any shit.

Long story short, after asking this guy repeatedly what I could do to make him happy he subdues me by putting my arms around my back and getting one of his buddies to lead me out of the concert. All the while talking about how hes going to arrest me if I come back in ...

Furthermore I was here with some foreign friends of mine and had recently been talking about how great Raleigh was. He actually escorted me out with a ""Visit Raleigh"" packet in hand.

I was / am so confused. I can't emphasize enough how compliant I was. I have never had any problems with police. This guy just thought he was being disrespected and took it out on me. That's not right.

To demonstrate how we do things in America, I went to another officer and told her the situation. She was reasonable and I am not interested in spending my time escalating the situation.

Anyways, I just wanted to vent -- I can demonstrate to you that sometimes there is nothing you can do when you encounter the wrong cop at the wrong time. If I had resisted in any way, I am sure I would be posting this tomorrow after getting home from jail. By the way, I had nothing to drink. Also, I want to say that this is way unusual for the RPD. I have a lot of respect for those guys -- and maybe this particular cop had a bad day.

As a message to cops though, I really have to emphasize that you need to treat each incident on its own merit. It isn't right to take out your frustrations on someone who doesn't deserve it. My friends and family are cops and when you overstep your authority it puts my family and friends indirectly in danger.",,False,,t5_2qht2,False,,,True,t3_wl1eh,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/wl1eh/just_got_kicked_out_of_concert_by_overzealous_cop/,

**Introduction to Barcraft**

So what is a Barcraft? A Barcraft is an event where you watch StarCraft II competitions in a bar, which may or may not answer the question. StarCraft II is one of the video games at the forefront of ""E-sports"", the rapidly growing world of electronic sports, where professional gamers battle it out in the virtual arena of a video game. 

Now, I know this may sound crazy (I was first introduced to the world of e-sports about 2 years ago, by StarCraft II, and I still find it somewhat unreal), but there are people that are, in fact, 'professional' gamers. Their main source of income is from competing as a pro-gamer, and it is their job - they practice 8-10 hours a day with other pro-gamers and with the aid of their coaches. These gamers almost always belong to a team , which is an organization with all of the same structure you'd expect from any other sports organization, from the owners handling the business aspects to the coaches. It's still in development, and there's still plenty of rough spots, but it is definitely growing and growing fast.

StarCraft II itself is a 'real-time strategy game', which basically means each player is building up an army to try and kill the other guy, and that it happens in real-time (as opposed to turn-based like Chess or Risk). The strategy aspect emphasizes a commanding knowledge of the game and how it works, while the real-time aspect forces high speed and precision (known as APM, or Actions Per Minute). Unlike other games, the player plays a dual-role of both managing their army in battle, as well as building up the army and choosing its composition back at base.

**[MLG Spring Arena Information](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=336091)**

An amazing packed weekend of StarCraft! Right after the SCTuesdays Open Tournament wraps up on Saturday night, we'll start up the VOD's from the GSL finals from the night before for GSL 2012 Season 2. The Global Starcraft League is consistently the best SCII tournament around, with the top players in the world fighting for the prestige of a GSL championship (and the money ain't bad either). 


Spring Arena 1 was a great event, and Spring Arena 2 should be even better - the player pool has grown from 8 to 32 participants, although only five are known at this time. The casters have been announced, and the broadcast details &amp; casters revealed, so check them out here! I guess TB did have a good excuse for not making it up here :D There'll also be eight POV streams, instead of the four from last arena, covering every single game being played (even if it isn't being casted). While this won't affect us on Sunday, it'll still make watching it the rest of the weekend a helluva thing.

On Tuesday nights at 6pm, they have snacks and drinks. However, you have to be 18+ to go and it costs money. (I'll call and find out how much if you want to go this night.)

I also wanted to apologize for the confusion regarding the 3rd meetup at Isaac Hunters, I didn't realize they were having a private party that night, so yea, sorry about that, will try not to let it happen again.

That being said, if there is still interest I would like to set up the next meetup in the Raleigh area again because you guys didn't really get one last time.  I would like to do it at my friends brewery, [Lone Rider Brewery](http://www.loneriderbeer.com/) located [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=lone+rider+brewery+map&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ei=KvOQTKjHB4SglAfOqtDjAQ&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AU&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A) on Friday Oct 1st from 6pm - 9:30pm.  

They don't serve food and there isn't a whole lot of seating so I figured this meetup could be a bit more low key, just a few drinks after work while hanging out on the deck, (they have cornhole)  :)  I will bring my little alien to help you find us.  Brier creek is nearby also if anyone wants to grab a bite to eat afterwards.  

I chose this spot because it's easy to get to (right off 540 and 70), plenty of parking, hopefully is new to most of you and doesn't take too much planning on my part (see the whole crazy busy thing).  I will try to set up the next one at a place with more options re: seating, non-alcoholic options, food, etc. but for now I hope this is agreeable.

If there are strong opinions one way or another however, I can still be persuaded into a change in venue, etc., let me know what you think.  Thanks guys, look forward to seeing you again!  

-Chris

I'm self-employed as the only member of an LLC tech-company which is registered in New York. Wife doesn't have income, stays at home with the first child. 

Our current BCBSNC plan does not have maternity coverage and the conservative estimate for the pre-natal care and delivery is over $16,000 including the ~50% self-pay discount. That is assuming everything goes perfectly and doesn't touch complications. Must be cesarean delivery, so BCBS's proposal of home-birth is out.

Since this is considered a pre-existing pregnancy, BCBS won't cover anything maternity related. 

I'm hunting around for an alternative way of covering the expense. 

Any suggestions?

The IUD doesn't always work.

I think she may not have been around her littermates long enough to learn proper bite inhibition. She also doesn't have ""dog manners"" down very well (she goes right for the face sniff instead of the well mannered ""here is my backside"" introduction, and sometimes barks at other dogs to get attention). She isn't aggressive towards other dogs at all, and tends to be the one getting pinned down by the puppies in her puppy class. She enjoys rough housing despite this though. 


So! If you have a vaccinated puppy that wants some quality puppy-on-puppy time, we are game. Mishka (my puppy) is 11 weeks old this week (13lbs currently), and she's currently up to date on her vaccinations. She's on frontline plus and is parasite and flea free. If multiple people want to do this, the more the merrier! I suggest meeting at the small dog area of the Southern Village dog park. There's never anyone in there.

Furniture (desk,  lamps, chairs, tables), a freezer, kitchen stuff, lots of kids' stuff (boys and girls; toys, clothes, games, and books). Yard stuff, too; a reel mower in very good condition, gas mower (that needs work and is therefore CHEAP), trimmer, etc. Some tools. Adult books &amp; adult clothes, too. Well not *adult* books, but grownup type books.

It's all indoors, so you won't sweat too much. The address is 120A Kingston drive in Chapel Hill, but the driveway is on Silver Cedar. Head to the intersection of Weaver Dairy and Kingston (near the Food Lion in Timberlyne) and head down Kingston. Turn right at the first stop sign. We are the first driveway on the right. Starts at 8 tomorrow (7/28) and we're planning on going until 2. We'll pick up again on Sunday afternoon. Ask for a Reddit discount, I'll give you a deal. Hell, I'll give you upvotes.

EDIT : I also have a sweet loft that I built for my daughter a few years ago. [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/8etDU.jpg). It's got a built in desk under it, and I'd love to see some other kid get to enjoy it as much as she has. If you're interested in it, I'll even help you set it up at your place. 

EDIT #2 : About done for the day, will be calling it quits about 2. Still have a bunch of toys left, freezer is still here, so is much of the kitchen stuff and the furniture (a table, dresser, TV cabinet). Most of the chairs are gone. We will be back in business on Sunday 7/29, starting in the afternoon. Nobody claimed a reddit discount....I was serious about that.

EDIT #3 : Back in business. 12:30PM 7/29. I'll post again when we leave. I'll be checking here, so if you have any questions, make a post. I can upload pics &amp; let you know what I still have.

EDIT #4 : Screw it. Shifting over to free. I'm still going to try &amp; sell the bigger items, but we still have way too much stuff. I want it GONE, and I'd rather you haul it off than me.

I've been told that things tend to work a lot slower than they do in California. I'm used to things working at a very fast pace, and I understand that the atmosphere is more laid back than I'd be used tom, more similar to Texas than to California. 

Central California is what I refer to as the Bible Belt of California, so I'm used to conservative politics and seeing churches all over the place.

My partner Courtney and I want to take you and our fellow Americans out for breakfast for part of a book we're writing: 'Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America'. We're currently in WV for the next few days and will next head into NC for what is likely a 10 day stretch. 

* [Breakfast with Strangers mainsite](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com)
* [BWS Facebook page - please like us](http://facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers)  

Our goal is to make stops in Asheville, Charlotte, Greenville, and a little stop here and there (dates soon) but we will definitely be in the Research Triangle. 

If you are interested in being our next breakfast please email us at: breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com

Let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA. Please include 'Triangle' in the subject line. 


**More details about our project**

On July 18, 2012 we hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.


**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. Here's a video we made when we launched our project: https://vimeo.com/44696027


**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

**Introduction to Barcraft**

So what is a Barcraft? A Barcraft is an event where you watch StarCraft II competitions in a bar, which may or may not answer the question. StarCraft II is one of the video games at the forefront of ""E-sports"", the rapidly growing world of electronic sports, where professional gamers battle it out in the virtual arena of a video game. 

Now, I know this may sound crazy (I was first introduced to the world of e-sports about 2 years ago, by StarCraft II, and I still find it somewhat unreal), but there are people that are, in fact, 'professional' gamers. Their main source of income is from competing as a pro-gamer, and it is their job - they practice 8-10 hours a day with other pro-gamers and with the aid of their coaches. These gamers almost always belong to a team , which is an organization with all of the same structure you'd expect from any other sports organization, from the owners handling the business aspects to the coaches. It's still in development, and there's still plenty of rough spots, but it is definitely growing and growing fast.

StarCraft II itself is a 'real-time strategy game', which basically means each player is building up an army to try and kill the other guy, and that it happens in real-time (as opposed to turn-based like Chess or Risk). The strategy aspect emphasizes a commanding knowledge of the game and how it works, while the real-time aspect forces high speed and precision (known as APM, or Actions Per Minute). Unlike other games, the player plays a dual-role of both managing their army in battle, as well as building up the army and choosing its composition back at base.",,False,,t5_2qht2,1341768501.0,,user,True,t3_w86t8,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/w86t8/sun_715_triangle_barcraft_nasl_s3_grand_finals/,

**[MLG Website](http://www.majorleaguegaming.com)**

It's been a few weeks to rest and recover and now it's time for the next Triangle Barcraft! Since this MLG is happening on the west coast, things are getting started a bit later than we're used to on a Sunday, so make sure you note the later time - of course, if you want to come in at 2PM like normal and start the party early, I doubt Blinco's would mind ;) Our last few Barcrafted events have been the MLG Spring Arenas, so there'll be some familiar faces in the competition, but as this is one of the MLG Championship events there's always that element of the unknown thanks to the Open Bracket, allowing anyone to compete. While historically speaking it's rare for a challenger to actually make their way through the open bracket up into the finals... it has happened before!
Not only will we have the MLG Spring Championship to watch, but we'll also have the Blizzard US Nationals going on at the same venue as well. They've split up their broadcasting so as not to overlap each other, and the schedule of Barcraftin' will be as follows:

6PM EDT - MLG Championship Loser's Finals (If you want to get started a little early, we'll be set up by 6 :D )   
7PM EDT - Blizzard US National Finals  
8-9PM EDT Start - MLG Championship Grand Finals  

Also, we'll have our SCII Bingo boards courtesy of [SCTuesdays](http://www.facebook.com/SCTuesdays) to help people practice their MICRO during the downtime :D

**Introduction to Barcraft**

So what is a Barcraft? A Barcraft is an event where you watch StarCraft II competitions in a bar, which may or may not answer the question. StarCraft II is one of the video games at the forefront of ""E-sports"", the rapidly growing world of electronic sports, where professional gamers battle it out in the virtual arena of a video game. 

Now, I know this may sound crazy (I was first introduced to the world of e-sports about 2 years ago, by StarCraft II, and I still find it somewhat unreal), but there are people that are, in fact, 'professional' gamers. Their main source of income is from competing as a pro-gamer, and it is their job - they practice 8-10 hours a day with other pro-gamers and with the aid of their coaches. These gamers almost always belong to a team , which is an organization with all of the same structure you'd expect from any other sports organization, from the owners handling the business aspects to the coaches. It's still in development, and there's still plenty of rough spots, but it is definitely growing and growing fast.

StarCraft II itself is a 'real-time strategy game', which basically means each player is building up an army to try and kill the other guy, and that it happens in real-time (as opposed to turn-based like Chess or Risk). The strategy aspect emphasizes a commanding knowledge of the game and how it works, while the real-time aspect forces high speed and precision (known as APM, or Actions Per Minute). Unlike other games, the player plays a dual-role of both managing their army in battle, as well as building up the army and choosing its composition back at base.",,False,,t5_2qht2,1338822247.0,,user,True,t3_uk5jg,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/uk5jg/sun_610_triangle_barcraft_mlg_spring_championship/,

[WSJ Article about Barcraft](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904070604576516462736084234.html) 

**Introduction to Barcraft**

So what is a Barcraft? A Barcraft is an event where you watch StarCraft II competitions in a bar, which may or may not answer the question. StarCraft II is one of the video games at the forefront of ""E-sports"", the rapidly growing world of electronic sports, where professional gamers battle it out in the virtual arena of a video game. 

Now, I know this may sound crazy (I was first introduced to the world of e-sports about 2 years ago, by StarCraft II, and I still find it somewhat unreal), but there are people that are, in fact, 'professional' gamers. Their main source of income is from competing as a pro-gamer, and it is their job - they practice 8-10 hours a day with other pro-gamers and with the aid of their coaches. These gamers almost always belong to a team , which is an organization with all of the same structure you'd expect from any other sports organization, from the owners handling the business aspects to the coaches. It's still in development, and there's still plenty of rough spots, but it is definitely growing and growing fast.

StarCraft II itself is a 'real-time strategy game', which basically means each player is building up an army to try and kill the other guy, and that it happens in real-time (as opposed to turn-based like Chess or Risk). The strategy aspect emphasizes a commanding knowledge of the game and how it works, while the real-time aspect forces high speed and precision (known as APM, or Actions Per Minute). Unlike other games, the player plays a dual-role of both managing their army in battle, as well as building up the army and choosing its composition back at base.",,False,,t5_2qht2,1351621023.0,,user,True,t3_11uio4,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/11uio4/triangle_barcraft_sunday_114_mlg_fall/,

I talked to the owners of a local gaming store called The Gamer's Armory. It's at the intersection of Walnut St &amp; Cary Towne Blvd in Cary.


They said they'd be happy to host a meetup for us! The lady told me to figure out a timeframe/date and she could make it work. So... when works for you guys? She said Sunday afternoons are generally the best for her. They're open from 1-6PM on Sundays, so we could do an afternoon meet. There's also a kickass pizza place nextdoor that delivers inside the gaming store, so that's awesome.


I figure having a public meetup at a game shop would probably go over better since my house couldn't accommodate the amount of people who showed interest, plus we could all get to know each other and see if we want to continue to do this on a regular basis.


I'd like to aim for one of the Sunday afternoons. The dates I'm thinking that would work, based on my conversations with her, are:


June 24th

July 1st

July 15th

July 22nd



Let me know which of these dates are preferable and I'll set it up and make it official!

So I'm from NY (Brooklyn) and kind of had my heart set on going to graduate school for Occupational Therapy at UNC starting in Fall 2012....until I didn't get in. Is it realistic/wise for me to think that I can move down there (I'm thinking to Chapel Hill/ Carrboro, but anywhere in the triangle would work) and get a job for a year, preferably working with special needs kids since that's what I've always done, and in the interim kind of buddy-buddy with some people at the OT department at UNC, reapply, and have my foot in the door for 2013 with already established connections?

I know that was quite a run-on sentence. I don't have much money so moving down there would kind of be a crap shoot, but at least according to craigslist, room shares down there are pretty cheap...

This Event is For You!,TurnerJ5,15,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/ljw33/beer_snob_cigar_guy_both_this_event_is_for_you/,"**Update**: looks like they are opening early. Arriving at 3 will be fine, but the event will officially open to the public at 1pm.

------------------------------



Hello fellow North Carolinians,

My company, [Savinelli Cigars,](http://www.savinellicigar.com/) is going to be throwing a huge party on **Saturday, Oct 29** at the [Aviator Brewery](http://www.aviatorbrew.com/brewery) in Fuquay-Varina, NC. The brewery opens at **3pm** and we'll be getting started shortly thereafter; if you want to plan on being there by 3:30 we'll be kicking things into gear around then and going til late into the evening. Everyone will be enjoying fine handcrafted Savinelli Nicaraguan cigars from a local cigar company paired with the excellent (usually hoppy) craft-brewed Aviator brews. There is no cover charge, just the cost of any beer or cigars you choose to enjoy. Also there will also be at least one sort of little contest going on involving free boxes of cigars or growlers of beer, or both! 

 The event has been severely underpublicized and I'm trying to spread the word now. Gonna go hit /cigars and /beer next. 

Cheers! (especially to those of you lighting up our sticks tonight!)

Can you read music? Were you ever part of your high school or college choir?



This might be for you! As a recent college grad, I miss having the opportunity to perform with fellow musicians. I am hoping maybe some talented people could get together and start something! Ideally, I would be aiming for ""young professional aged people,"" but if you're interested and you don't fit in that category, do not dismay (basically I don't want to open this up to fourth graders, but I'm fine with older, experienced people)! Just let me know you would like to participate! As far as music type... I love Eric Whitacre and other classical music. However, I'm open to other music (broadway, pop, Buble... etc!). I don't plan on doing this on an audition basis (certainly not a super formal audition!), more just a fun thing for anyone who would like to join.



If you are interested, PM me or post here with the following:

* Name
* vocal part and/or instrument
* What are your strengths? How could you contribute to our group?
* prior experience
* What kind of music would you like to see the group perform?


For example, I would PM myself the following:

* Jewels
* soprano, tuba, piano, clarinet
* I am an excellent organizer/planner. I enjoy getting people together and planning events.
* musical lessons since childhood, high school and college wind ensemble and choir, music minor in college
* Eric Whitacre!!!!!! and broadway... and classical...

http://www.space.com/20751-lyrid-meteor-shower-peaking-now.html

I have never watched a meteor shower in this area, so any information will be much appreciated. Thanks!!

**EDIT**

So here's how it went and hopefully if anyone searches the subreddit for this info, this post will be useful. First, if you're a rookie like me you should definitely check out [Raleigh Astronomy Club page](http://www.raleighastro.org/).

I set up at the bridge on Creedmoor and Falls Lake. According to [this light pollution map](http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/), it is a decent viewing area. I checked the [moon set time](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/moonrise.html) to get there. I had a clear view of the sky but I have to admit there was a bit too much traffic even at 4 in the morning. There was a car passing by almost every minute. I also should have brought something to protect myself because to be there by myself in the dark of the night I was a bit jumpy at times. This [accuweather](http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/weekend-star-gazing-where-to-s/10351832) article and map showed that we had ""fair"" viewing of the shower. Not good but not bad either. Well, I caught only about 4-5 meteors in about 45 minutes (then had to bolt because it was a brisk 35F and more and more cars passing by).

It would also help if I could locate the stars a bit more efficiently. I studied the star maps beforehand but once you're out there, it doesn't look as nice as the maps ;)

Our particular group is pretty small and runs in Granville County. I know there are groups closer to the Triangle ([Sir Walter's](http://www.swh3.com)  and [Carolina Larrikins](http://www.carolinalarrikins.com/)), but I know there are probably a few of you who might live a little closer to us. We're also trying to schedule our runs to not conflict with SWH3 and CL (but we're really bad at planning).

Anyway, we're having a run today in Wilton, NC and we usually run every other Sunday (subject to change at the drop of a hat).

**[GSL Code S Finals](http://http://www.gomtv.net/2012gsls5/)**

It's a late night Barcraft, as we've got the GSL Code S finals coming to America for the second time ever, and they'll be happening at IPL5 in Vegas! Given the times, that means we'll be Barcrafting it up pretty late - it depends on how well the players cooperate, but we could easily be going into the wee hours of the morning with this thing ;) This is looking to be one of the last events of the year we'll be able to Barcraft, so make sure to make it out if you can!


The GSL Finals themselves are shaping up to be quite the event, with all four of the players remaining surprise upsets to make it this far. We have two Zergs - TSL_HyuN, a Zerg player from the BW era who's shown some amazing play in the last few seasons, finally making it (almost) all the way, and MVP_Sniper, a solid Zerg player who simply has never managed to shine, until now. And we have two Terrans - STX_INnoVation, a solid Terran player from the KESPA teams, one of TL's elephants in the room, and Axiom's Ryung, another absolutely rock solid Terran who's also never managed to make it this far into the GSL tournament, despite a solid macro playstyle with very few holes.

 All four of these players could take the Code S trophy, depending on how they play. It's a little sad (and odd) to see the Protoss fall as early and as quickly as they did, given how strong they've been lately, but we've got a semi-finals and potentially a grand finals harking back to the original days of the GSL and the many great battles between Terran and Zerg opponents in their finals.


The schedule for the Barcraft should be:
9:30PM - Initial set up and streaming.
10PM - Start watching some of the GSL World All-Stars tournament from 10PM-11PM as a warmup.
11PM - The GSL Code S Finals begin!

[WSJ Article about Barcraft](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904070604576516462736084234.html) 

**Introduction to Barcraft**

So what is a Barcraft? A Barcraft is an event where you watch StarCraft II competitions in a bar, which may or may not answer the question. StarCraft II is one of the video games at the forefront of ""E-sports"", the rapidly growing world of electronic sports, where professional gamers battle it out in the virtual arena of a video game. 

Now, I know this may sound crazy (I was first introduced to the world of e-sports about 2 years ago, by StarCraft II, and I still find it somewhat unreal), but there are people that are, in fact, 'professional' gamers. Their main source of income is from competing as a pro-gamer, and it is their job - they practice 8-10 hours a day with other pro-gamers and with the aid of their coaches. These gamers almost always belong to a team , which is an organization with all of the same structure you'd expect from any other sports organization, from the owners handling the business aspects to the coaches. It's still in development, and there's still plenty of rough spots, but it is definitely growing and growing fast.

StarCraft II itself is a 'real-time strategy game', which basically means each player is building up an army to try and kill the other guy, and that it happens in real-time (as opposed to turn-based like Chess or Risk). The strategy aspect emphasizes a commanding knowledge of the game and how it works, while the real-time aspect forces high speed and precision (known as APM, or Actions Per Minute). Unlike other games, the player plays a dual-role of both managing their army in battle, as well as building up the army and choosing its composition back at base.",,False,,t5_2qht2,False,,user,True,t3_13rvro,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/13rvro/triangle_barcraft_saturday_121_gsl_code_s_finals/,

I'll try to keep it brief, but here is my situation: I live in a small condominium building, and one of the residents on the floor below me has begun leaving their two dogs locked up on the porch in a small crate. You can clearly see them if you go around behind the building. I first heard them yesterday morning around 5:30 AM when they woke me up. When I got home from work this evening, they were either still out there, or out there again, and were constantly barking. I figured that the owners must have gone out and therefore were unaware of the situation. 

Then around one this morning, they woke me up again. The dogs are still on the porch. I decided this was too much, and went down to knock on the owner's door. No answer. I rang the bell. Nothing. If the dogs are still out there tomorrow after work and creating a nuisance, I'll go down there again. 

So here's my question - if the neighbor tells me to F off or something like that, do I stand a good chance of getting the law on my side? I looked up the Wake County ordinances and it seems they are in [pretty clear violation](http://www.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/North%20Carolina/wakecounty_nc/titleixgeneralregulations/chapter91animals?f=templates$fn=document-frameset.htm$q=dog%20$x=server$3.0#LPHit1), but I have no idea if it's enforced. Has anyone had any experience with getting the cops involved in a situation like this?

If things don't work out with the neighbor, I'd go to the condo association before the police, but I just want to know what my options are here. I don't like getting the police involved in something that should be able to get resolved between a couple of adults, but if I'm left with no other choice, so be it.

**TLDR** - has anyone here had to get the cops involved over a neighbor's barking dog? If so, how did it turn out?",,False,,t5_2qht2,False,,,True,t3_u0mjj,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/u0mjj/neighbor_with_a_barking_dog/,

1. I need a good mechanic. Looking to get rid of my car in 6 months, but in the meantime, I don't want to rely on Google for finding a shop if I need one.

2. If anyone uses a tailor, I could use that recommendation too. Not looking to get a bespoke suit, just to get clothes altered.

3. I want to know what streets and bars are worth hitting. For the record I prefer the price of ""$2 domestic"" bars, but the atmosphere and the women (and staff) at cocktail places. In Winston there were literally two streets worth anything, I'm assuming there are many, many more here.

4. What are some fun things to do during the weekend that don't involve shopping? I'll do enough of that, just interested in what other stuff I can do- both by myself and with 1 or more people.

5. What areas should I avoid entirely? 

6. Where is the best place other than bars or church for a single 22.5 year old guy to meet friends and girls?

* That's probably enough for now. I'm sure I'll think of more later.

In any case, like I said- I'm 22.5, been out of college 1 year, worked a lame job for a lot of that, finally got a break and got several interviews and offers, and took one for a large insurance company here in Raleigh. I'm working right at the Crabtree Mall, and after the first few weeks, my shift will be 11:30 to 8pm. Because this is Reddit, top subreddits probably say more than ""I'm interested in"". I love [/r/malefashionadvice](/r/malefashionadvice), even though it has plenty of quirks. [/r/keto](/r/keto) Helped me lose 72.4 pounds last year, and I've kicked it off again to drop another 20 or more this year (5 down already, my mediums fit more medium-y). That and [/r/loseit](/r/loseit) (and afformentioned MFA) changed me from a fat gamer into a stylish attractive guy, and for that I am eternally grateful. I also like [/r/motorcycles](/r/motorcycles), and plan on getting an SV650 in the first half of the year, [/r/games](/r/games), [/r/complextro](/r/complextro), [/r/electrohouse](/r/electrohouse), and a few random other communities.

I've spent all of today sending emails and calling non-kill shelters waiting for responses. I thought maybe someone in my area would like a cat or cats in their home. Their names are Angel (7), Faith (2), and Wingnut (4). Here is a picture of each in that order http://imgur.com/a/pObz5#0

Angel is mostly white with a black spot on her back that looks like a flying angel. She is over weight, but a big built cat. She licks everything in sight and she loves to watch Animal Planet and she'll snuggle right next to you when you want to sleep. If you are upset, she'll be right at your side. She will cry at the door to go outside, but she is an indoor kitty.

Faith is the youngest and boy does she have an attitude. She also responds to every other name then her own. She will snuggle and play around, but don't touch her belly or pick her up. You can hide behind a wall and pop out and she will meow and slowly hunt you down until she finds you. She is good with strangers, and good with other cats, but she does like to start trouble. She also can't have any doors closed on her, unless they've always been closed for boundaries, or she'll scratch the rug until you let her in. She can be a little trouble, but boy is she sweet. She also jumps up on light switches until they are in the ""off"" position.

Wingnut is shy and fluffy. She will sit in the hallway like a Buddha statue and just purr. She sleeps with her paws in the air and be the laziest thing in the world, but swing a string around her and it's a different cat! Her hair can get really clumpy if no one has combed her, but I try to comb her once a day if she lets me. She likes to be carried and she is TERRIFIED of the outdoors. But she is such a sweetheart and the lappiest lap cat you could ever find. 

All three of them enjoy an open window and a place to lay by that open window. They don't dig-up furniture, except for Faith, and laser lights are their best friends. Faith and Angel do better together than Faith and Wingnut, but they all do about the same together or alone. I love them so much and I just want them to find a good home or homes.

Looking for thoughts/reviews/etc of the local strip clubs. My only experience is with 2 trips to ~~Thee Dollhouse~~ The Men's Club about 5 years ago. I was relatively happy with it.

I'll (hopefully) be celebrating something in about 6 months. I'd like to hear some suggestions about the local establishments. Here's a few things on my list:

* Cover fee doesn't really won't bother me
* I probably will only buy a drink or three
* I'm not trying to ""pull"" a girl from the joint. Just there for an hour or two's worth of fun.
* I plan on going alone.

Open to suggestions, recommendations, etc. Time of day, day of week, costs for floor dances, costs for private room dances, how the dancer's are, etc.

However, there are a lot of negative reviews. Can anyone shed some light with their personal experience? Whats confusing is that even the leasers who disliked him said they were great about responding to maintenance needs quickly. Is he considered a slum lord because he cheats you on your deposit? In my experience, that's pretty much to be expected in small to mid sized college towns. I can't tell if he's really horrible, or if the problem is a series of privileged Duke undergrads who weren't satisfied. 

I like old houses, it's close to campus, and I don't mind losing my deposit if it comes to that. If he really is good about fixing things on time than I'm a-ok.

**Introduction to Barcraft**

So what is a Barcraft? A Barcraft is an event where you watch StarCraft II competitions in a bar, which may or may not answer the question. StarCraft II is one of the video games at the forefront of ""E-sports"", the rapidly growing world of electronic sports, where professional gamers battle it out in the virtual arena of a video game. 

Now, I know this may sound crazy (I was first introduced to the world of e-sports about 2 years ago, by StarCraft II, and I still find it somewhat unreal), but there are people that are, in fact, 'professional' gamers. Their main source of income is from competing as a pro-gamer, and it is their job - they practice 8-10 hours a day with other pro-gamers and with the aid of their coaches. These gamers almost always belong to a team , which is an organization with all of the same structure you'd expect from any other sports organization, from the owners handling the business aspects to the coaches. It's still in development, and there's still plenty of rough spots, but it is definitely growing and growing fast.

StarCraft II itself is a 'real-time strategy game', which basically means each player is building up an army to try and kill the other guy, and that it happens in real-time (as opposed to turn-based like Chess or Risk). The strategy aspect emphasizes a commanding knowledge of the game and how it works, while the real-time aspect forces high speed and precision (known as APM, or Actions Per Minute). Unlike other games, the player plays a dual-role of both managing their army in battle, as well as building up the army and choosing its composition back at base.",,False,,t5_2qht2,False,,user,True,t3_1aa7ji,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/1aa7ji/triangle_barcraft_sunday_317_mlg_winter/,

More details to be posted shortly, but head on over to their website: http://us.esl.tv/iem-katowice-2013/ and check out the player and caster lineup. The schedule for the Barcraft should be:


*12:30PM* - Barcraft begins. We'll watch some of the highlights of the games that have occurred over the weekend, and any live games that may be happening (the schedule's a little unclear).

*01:15PM* - Grand Finals begin. 


We should be there at noon setting up, so feel free to come out a little early if you want - it's been too long since our last Barcraft, and I know I can't wait to get back in the bar and nerd out over some delicious, delicious beer and food :D

I am a 25 year old lady professional who just started running again after a long hiatus (I was injured in a car accident in August).  I am looking for someone, or a group of people, of similar running skills.  Right now, I have to walk/run since it's been so long since I ran on a daily basis.  I average a 12 minute mile, but I'm getting better every day.  The thing is that I need motivation!  Talking with someone while running is a great motivational tool for me and keeps me accountable to someone for keeping on track with my workouts.  I also just moved to Raleigh in November, and it would be super if I could meet some new friends while getting back into shape.  Unfortunately, the only time I can run is early in the morning (I usually head out for my run at 6am), or in the evenings (around 6pm).  That's another reason I would like a partner-- to avoid getting snatched behind a bush or something since it's so dark out!

Anyway, I figured what better place to look for a running partner (or running partners) than the place I happen to spend 98.23% of my procrastination time?  So, if you need a partner, or know of any good running groups in the area that would work with a slowpoke like me, please let me know!

If you know of any flight attendants or any people flying RDU to any airport within two or three hours drive of Oakland (SFO, OAK, SJC, SAC, and beyond), any help would be greatly appreciated. Her owner would meet you at RDU with Trinity in a soft-side carrier, and you would only need to take her through security and on the flight. I would meet you at the airport to pick her up, and could drive you wherever you needed to go within a reasonable distance (better than a cab, I suppose).


I can pay the fee to fly her in-cabin as well as $100 to compensate her courier for their troubles.

---
The back story, for anyone who is interested: I've been involved with Siamese and Oriental Shorthair rescue on and off for about ten years, and just recently lost two of my three cats within five months of each other (one to lymphoma at age 8, one from diabetic complications/old age at age ~20). That leaves me with one extremely lonely cat, Petrie, who has never for a single day of his five years been without other cats, and he isn't doing well as an only cat. [This is how Petrie used to spend all of his time](http://i.imgur.com/qdm7h.jpg) (he's the brown and white one, the tabby draped on him is his best buddy who most recently died) and now he just mopes about, cries, and doesn't eat as well as he should. I took him to two vets to make sure there were no underlying health issues causing this behaviour, and they both agreed (after bloodwork and physical exams) that Petrie's miserable as hell and needs other cats.


Enter Trinity, who is a confirmed snuggler and highly social with other cats. [This is a link to Trinity's picture](http://i.imgur.com/sYD0y.jpg). She's a calico Oriental Shorthair with some corneal damage who is on her third home, and I'm hoping to be her last stop. She was in a hoarder situation (&gt;35 cats in a small trailer) and after rescue lived with a vet who can no longer keep her due to a rough family situation. Since she was from a hoarding situation, she is VERY cat-oriented, and her current owner thinks she'd be perfect as a companion cat to my remaining guy.",,False,,t5_2qht2,False,,,True,t3_12xzn2,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/12xzn2/a_long_shot_anyone_flying_from_the_triangle_area/,

Other miscellaneous things...we're all a really tight-knit team here, and have a service-oriented ""is there anything I can do to help you?"" sort of culture.

I'm looking for someone tech savvy, personable, and detail-oriented.

The pay isn't outstanding - 22k a year, but there's lots of opportunity for advancement as we're a rapidly expanding company with a lot of good things happening. (Clearly, as I've been promoted after only 5 months on the job).

College degree not required, although intelligence is. :) Send me your referrals, peeps! Thanks!

She's a French Lop-Ear bunny, about 3yrs old, ~8 lbs, and about a little smaller than an average housecat (aobut the size of a Pomeranian dog). She's house broken, and pretty much just needs a litter box (not for cats, there's an even simpler type for rabbits) in the bathroom...YES! she knows to seek out a bathroom wherever she is.  She's pretty low-key and likes to lounge just as much as she loves attention. She's great with kids, strangers, and can be quite playful. I will say that she hasn't really had any experiences with other pets, so I dont know how that sort of environment might work.

I'm coming to Reddit hoping that I can give her to a good home, or even an elementary school classroom, instead of giving her to an animal shelter. I love her a lot and while I'm sad that I can't bring her with me, I really would feel relieved knowing that she's making someone else happy and not just penned up in a room of cages. PM me of you are interested, or might know of someone who is. This isn't just for Raleigh, but Durham, Greensboro, Winston-Salem...somewhere not too far, and don't let that be a deterrent because I'm sure we can work a meeting point, too.

I'll be cross posting this in the relevant regional subreddits and r/aww, also. Again, any questions that you may have are welcome and encouraged...I just want to make sure that she'll be safe and OK with whoever adopts her.

2. If school isn't cancelled, how bad do the roads get down here with trucks with plows and stuff?

A place so magical, drunk go-karting...drunk...and...and so...I dunno never been there but sounds awesome and it's all ages. Google it. Let's do this.


[This](http://www.frankiesfunpark.com/raleigh/) is that Frankie's place where the meet up could potentially be. It's in the Brier Creek area, if that changes anyone's opinion one way or the other. Also, it really only has concession-stand type food and no alcoholic beverages, so that should be kept in mind. **EDIT: They have an in-house restaurant, I'm not sure what the hours are. I'm assuming it's the same as the entire, um, fun park? Still no alcohol there though for the 21+ crowd**

Use this thread to discuss times, alternative places if you are opposed to Frankie's, etc. I really hope we can figure something out for next week!

**Edit 2: It now appears that the general consensus is no on the Frankie front. There seems to be a lot of interest in seeing Philthy42 perform at Comedyworx though! So, how about it?

So my proposal is this;  
1) Post your favorite Raleigh venue (maybe with a brief description on why it is awesome!)

So I'm looking for a full dress Scottish kilt to wear (since it's the only proper apparel in my mind).  If anyone has a setup I could borrow or rent I would sincerely appreciate it.  I'm 6'0"" and have a 34 waist.

^ Marketing firm in question...

Just wondering if anyone on /r/triangle is in good standing with this firm. I'm planning on working there unless people have had some miserable experiences with them.

***UPDATE***
I've asked one of my friends, and he has worked for them before. They make you pay for a starter set of CUTCO knives for $100+, then have you go door-to-door trying to sell them. Who the H needs 10 knives for cooking anyways? So yes, the claim about people who worked for that company losing money is true.
