I'm almost thirty now and I have always felt ashamed of my poor mathematical abilities. Exponents were the toughest for me, not the basic ones, but when they started getting weird... exponents in the negative, and fractional exponents; I had to watch the same videos over and over, pausing every few seconds trying to comprehend what Sal was talking about. But radicals were really fun because I enjoy factorizing for some reason. And now that I understand exponents I find them fun too, which means I'm really looking forward to logarithms, which I guess are related to exponents in some way?

Anyway no one knows I am doing this, and if they did know I am sure I would be made fun of terribly.

I am 29 years old, the last time I took ANY Algebra was over a decade ago, but, it gets more interesting. From asking around on Reddit, it seems like many people took multiple maths classes in high school, starting with Algebra 1, and Algebra 2, and usually moving onto Geometry, Trig, or Calculus.

That wasn't the case for me. I was so bad at math that I took Algebra 1 in two parts: Algebra 1A, and Algebra 1B. I actually failed Algebra 1A, and had to take it over the summer that year, and that summer I ""passed"" it with a D and never took ANY more math in high school.

My understanding is that in a lot of schools/states that I would never have been able to get a high school diploma without more math, or even better grades, but I have my transcript and it confirms what I am saying.

In 2003 I began attending a community college and had to take a placement test, I placed well in every area except math, and landed in a class called math 070. 070 was an arithmetic class, and honestly was so hard that I had to drop it.

I would always do SOMETHING wrong, whether it was switching a sign, or forgetting basic rules, and it made me hate math even more!

I have dealt with my well below average math skills for most of my entire life, after all, I never had a job that math skills mattered in any way, so it never needed to be addressed.

Well, until I got accepted through part-time classroom studies at a University. I decided to become a computer Science major, because well, the only thing even close to an aptitude that I have are computer skills. The very first class I signed up for, which I just finished, was ""college algebra"", a five week course.

If you are wondering how I even ""got in"" the class, since I went in via part-time classroom studies, I never took a placement test, otherwise I certainly would not have been able to enroll in the class, nonetheless, I told myself I would do it because it had to be done.

Over the last five weeks I have done almost nothing but math. I am positive that over the last five weeks I have done more math than the entirety of my life prior. 

I utilized every bit of help I could: My teacher's office hours, which I attended every day, my University's ""Math help center"", Khan Academy, and even my girlfriend. I practiced, and practiced.

I came into the class with such a woeful level of understanding: 

I didn't understand the concept of an equation, my understanding of math was that you ""solved"" a problem to get an answer...Not that the answer in the original problem were equal in a literal sense...If that makes sense.

Let me try and give an example: saying 2^(2) = 4. I knew the ""result"" of 2^(2) was 4, but I never realized or understood that 2^(2) WAS 4. So when it came to Algebra, I never realized that when you are ""finding"" x, that really what was happening is that you were truly trying to determine was x had been all along. I thought that x didn't have a value until you gave it a value.

I had a ton of these fundamental misunderstandings about how math ""worked"". It wasn't until this class, and the last five weeks that things that should be obvious to someone by middle school, were just finally making sense.

Anyway, I still plan on going forward with Computer Science, and now that I have finally made these basic connections with math, I feel like with enough time I could begin to understand anything about math.

THINK IT OUT ON PAPER. Something I find extremely beneficial when learning alone, is writing out the problem. Try writing questions that you need to answer to get a better understanding, then questions that might help you move towards answering those questions. But most importantly write and put things on paper, sketches if need be, including plots. They really help untangle some of your wooly thinking and help gain clarity, which for me is an incredibly powerful tool for learning mathematics. I always thought I needed a teacher to teach me mathematics, now I have realized that for most questions that I have, if I explore my thinking on paper, I can answer them myself.

2. BECOME FAMILIAR WITH A CONCEPT. Sometimes I can get myself bogged down, with craving that moment when everything just clicks and makes complete sense (or so I think!). These moments are quite addictive and without realizing it, I can become hooked on them and think that everything I learn in mathematics works like that. Not all learning is accompanied by a euphoric eureka moment. So become familiar with the ideas, practice them, use them in more advanced contexts, even if you feel you don't really get them, and as a consequence you might just get them. When I think about this I always think of a circle. You can do the math that defines what a circle is, but it's the constant repetition of seeing them that really plants the concept of a circle in your mind. Perhaps you already get the ideas you are struggling with, you just don't feel them, because you aren't all that familiar with them. But you will do, as you keep pushing on and working with the idea and related ones.

3. MULL OVER IT, THEN GIVE IT A REST. It's not unusual for me to come up against a concept that I struggle with for some time, I finally give up and work on other things related and then, at a later date, I look back and cannot understand why I didn't get it. Sometimes struggling with a problem gets it into the back of the mind and that is where the real work is done, without you even realizing it, in the powerhouse of your subconscious.

4. DON'T BE AFRAID TO MOVE ON. If you are struggling to understand something and you have worked it out on paper and done all you can to become familiar with the idea I think it can be a mistake to not move on. It could very well be new applications that are more advanced that give you a better understanding of basic concepts. So have no fear and keep on pushing through, you will get it and sometimes without even realizing it. In the worse case scenario, you will have learnt other things and not just spent countless hours stuck. Accepting that we won't understand everything perfectly I believe can be critical to going miles rather than meters.",,False,self,t5_2rdi4,True,,,True,t3_k49h7,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/k49h7/my_4_golden_keys_to_learning_mathematics/,
1334462241.0,43,self.learnmath,saesg,Don't be a chump - use long multiplication for multiplying polynomials,StevenXC,44,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/saesg/dont_be_a_chump_use_long_multiplication_for/,"Thought of this the other day when a fellow grad student was working out the product of a couple of polynomials. Here's the method we all learned to do it in grade school:

    [; (x^3-3x^2+x+3)(2x^3+4x^2-x-2) ;]

Use the distributive property...

    [; =x^3(2x^3+4x^2-x-2)-3x^2(2x^3+4x^2-x-2) ;]

    [; + x(2x^3+4x^2-x-2)+3(2x^3+4x^2-x-2) ;]

And distribute again...

    [; =2x^6+4x^5-x^4-2x^3-6x^5-12x^4+3x^3+6x^2 ;]

    [; + 2x^4+4x^3-x^2-2x+6x^3+12x^2-3x-6 ;]

And combine like terms...

    [; = 2x^6 - 2x^5 - 11x^4 + 11x^3 + 17x^2 - 5x - 6;]

That's correct, but it's a pain. We can save a lot of writing by setting up the problem like so, and treating it like long multiplication.

                           1x^3 -  3x^2 + 1x + 3
    *                      2x^3 +  4x^2 - 1x - 2
    -------------------------------------------
                        -  2x^3 +  6x^2 - 2x - 6
                -  1x^4 +  3x^3 -  1x^2 - 3x
           4x^5 - 12x^4 +  4x^3 + 12x^2
    2x^6 - 6x^5 +  2x^4 +  6x^3
    -------------------------------------------
    2x^6 - 2x^5 - 11x^4 + 11x^3 + 17x^2 - 5x - 6

[BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!](http://troll.me/images/billy-mays/but-wait-theres-more.jpg) I wasted a lot of time writing out those x^n things, huh. Let's safe a few strokes of the pen by dropping them altogether.

                   1   -3    1    3
    *              2    4   -1   -2
    ---------------------------------
                  -2    6   -2   -6
              1    3   -1   -3
         4  -12    4   12
    2   -6    2    6
    ---------------------------------
    2   -2  -11   11   17   -5   -6

While it's still the same application of the distributive property as the first method described, you can shave a lot of time out of your tedious calculations using this method.

So I want to teach a comprehensive, 9th grade through 12th grade, pre-college level course via Reddit at **no charge**, just like CarlH is doing for Computer Programming. I think this learning-via-Reddit style of learning is better than just reading books because (i) you have a human being to answer your questions in a timely fashion; (ii) you learn better when small chunks of information are presented, rather than ""chapters"" in a book.

Just like CarlH says, ""this is especially intended for those who want to learn, but cannot afford ..., or who have tried to teach themselves unsuccessfully"".

I **strongly** believe that math textbooks are too wordy and too theoretical. I understand that some parts of mathematics will always be abstract, but I still believe that math can be taught via practical problem solving and constant thinking, not via ""exercises in the back of each chapter"". 

My guess is that this would require 1-2 hours of work each day for the learners and could be done in 4-6 months of time. I can put out a complete outline of the course if there is enough interest.

So, like the title said, I'm 33 and work for a large environmental organization in Central Africa. The job is fascinating, many responsibilities and opportunties, and I learn A LOT every day, which is the most important thing.

My biggest regret (besides a horrible relationship in my early 20s) is the fact that I did not get a science or engineering degree - more for the rigour than the content. Not any reason to explain why it didn't happen. It is at it is....

Anyway I've been mulling taking a online math and economics degree (University of London), taking as many statistics credits as possible.
I'm not someone who usually embarks on a project without thinking things through. So, before embarking on this process (and spending money), I'm going to test the waters.

Basically, my goal is to go through all the the first two year's required math textbooks before signing up for anything. That is my objective. However, I am fully aware of the enormity of this task. To fully lear math, you need 1) to exercise, and 2) to be able to get help.

So, here is my question: as someone who has not had any mathematics for 15 years, where do I go? I was a very good math student in High School, and have a good memory so not all is gone. 
But I need to find a website or forum where I can re-learn algebra and calculus, where there are a lot of exercises with corrections, and where I can get help if need.

If anybody knows where I can get some online textbooks that would also be great. Amazon doesn't deliver where I live.

Note that I live in Central Africa, so besides working and drinking beer, there is literally nothing to do. I have time for this.

Thanks for any and all input. I'll try to keep you updated.

I will be spending approximately 4 months in a county jail starting in the next month and a half. I will avoid the back story but it ends with me wanting to use the time to better myself and that involves a plan to immediately take my education more seriously after getting out and enrolling back in college to pursue some kind of engineering degree. 

The problem being engineering involves a great deal of math obviously, which I am not too experienced with. I don't dislike math at all, I just had a very lazy attitude in High School and never took math classes to my fullest potential. As a result I ended high school having only finished intermediate algebra (also because they revised the math curriculum as I was going through high school so the math I took in 9-10 was revised and pushed back to 10-12 resulting in me taking pretty much the same courses twice).

I'm worried that my lack of math experience will put me behind when I begin my studies at a Uni so I want to use the time in jail to study math to better prepare myself, but I have some worries about this. First and foremost is the fact that I don't know If i'll have access to a calculator which really limits the type of math I can learn unfortunately. Also don't know about graphing paper. I will indeed have paper and pencil though, so maybe hope isn't lost.

Basically I'm just looking for some advice on refreshing quickly on intermediate Algebra and continuing on to Trigonometry and Pre-Calc to ultimately be ready for Calc classes at Uni when I get out. I will be allowed to have books sent to me and I was thinking of having these two books sent to me to work from, but not sure if there are better options out there.

Are there alternative methods for someone trying to start over?,Mister_Market,28,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/18mgm2/i_hated_the_way_i_learned_math_in_school_are/,"Math always seemed too abstract to hold my attention. I never fully understood how learning math translated into daily life or how it relates to some of the more important aspects of life (silly, I know). However, after taking a symbollic logic class in college (part of my philosophy major) and noticing how important math is in other areas I'm fascinated with, I find myself thinking that math would be fascinating if only I could get past lower level drudgery. Long story, I want to start over, but I need a new curriculum. Here are some things I'm looking for:  
  
1. I want to fully understand why I'm doing something and the principles that underlie what I'm doing. In school, my teachers would teach give me a bunch of equations and tell me to crunch. I know about quadratic formula and how to derive (at least I think I remember), but I have no idea why they work that way or why they're important.
  
2. I would love to see real life applications of the math I'm learning. I think this would capture my attention and allow me to apply math in other things that I love.  
  
3. I'm a philosophy nut so I find logic proofs pretty interesting (even if I suck at doing them). I imagine that starting with axioms and proving my way up would be fascinating.  
  
4. I would love something that gave a detailed history of math concepts.  
  
5. I have a lot of questions I'd like to have answered. Like the difference between inclusive and exclusive counting and why we do one and not the other? Is there a logical foundation for math (I'm thinking about Russell's Principia Mathematica)? How do you get from 0 to 1 if you can subdivide things infinitely, or to put it another way, is there an infinite sequence between 0 and 1 (like Zeno's Paradox with numbers)?
  
6. I'm looking for different methods of learning math recommendations (e.g. Saxon math, Singapore method, etc.) and good textbooks for the subject.
  
Thank you for all your help Learn_Math! If there are any problems/stupid aspects to what I'm asking for, please let me know. I'm here to learn after all.

This isn't my issue, but the lack of interest in the mathematics field. I don't know what started my downward spiral of hatred with the subject, but what I do know is that for years it has made me irrationally upset to learn it. It is my weak spot by far, and truly the only subject in school I have an issue with. Science isn't far behind because of its math dependency. 

Everyone wants to go to college for something they love and come out of it with a solid career. I love computers, tinkering and whatnot, but every time I tell a new teacher what it is I'm interested in, they tell me it is all very math related. So, how about programming? I feel like within that particular specialization of computer science, the math is probably very niche stuff.

Maybe I'm wrong. In any case, the highest math I've completed is Algebra 2 and Trigonometry that I only passed because I had a teacher that gave most people A's. What I did learn hasn't ever stuck with me.

Perhaps the class room setting goes too fast for me, just barely scratching the surface of any one topic and that, in turn, leaves me unmotivated and cranky. Another issue is rarely have I been taught anything in math that we've used in a hands-on situation, it's all just been hypothetical bullshit situations. 

I have a chance to take a physics course this year and we will be programming a robot with BASIC, would this be more beneficial to my idea of an ideal class instead of taking another math course? The class sizes are ~12 people.

I love English and history, but those job markets aren't great. I don't want to end up being a teacher. Is it one of those situations where I may have to delay gratification for struggling in a subject for a greater goal? How can I make it a more pleasurable experience?

My explanation of i was that using the quadratic equation to factor certain polynomials one winds up with the need to find the square root of a negative number, so i was invented and defined in order to solve those problems.

He asked, well, what about dividing by zero? We've left that ""undefined"" and worked up all kinds of workarounds (limits, etc.) to explicitly *not* have to divide by zero - why wasn't there a unit ""d"" (or whatever), defined to be 1 divided by 0 - that way when you get something that divides by 0 you can just make a ""complex number"" out of it, much like we do with the square root of a negative number.

Help alleviate/confirm my fears!,lifesucksdie,17,0,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/vg0ba/i_am_planning_to_begin_a_degree_in_physics_or/,"I did distance education for junior high and highschool, and it made me despise math.  I bustled through with a poor but passing grade, but I learned nothing, since I didn't want to!  I'm 22 now, and plan to take physics as a second degree, since my first degree is useless.  After 5 years of no math, I'm pretty poor at it.  It's too bad that I enjoy it.

Since I'm essentially learning math ""from scratch"" now, are there any steps I should take to ensure that I learn things from the start in a way such that I develop good habits?  I'm also worried that I'm simply incapable of handling math classes; math never has been my strong point, and I suspect that, like music, some people simply are incapable of ever being good at it if a strong foundation wasn't built during childhood.  I know its pleasant to believe that this isn't always the case, but for something, it simply is.

When I work through problems, it takes me forever, and I make ridiculous amounts of silly mistakes, which is why I hated math during highschool.  I have trouble accepting facts if I'm unable to prove them to myself in a convincing way.  It has its benefits, but I spend absolutely stupid amounts of time on single problems until I've convinced myself that the solution makes sense.  

Finally, what should I focus on?  Of course, I'll be taking calculus, linear algebra and physics next semester.  How many math courses would it be reasonable to take each semester? 

I'm currently using Khan Academy (the explanations are sometimes a bit too superficial for me) and a a textbook, ""precalculus"" by James Stewart.  Are there any other resources I should be using?  What topics should I be focusing on?  I only have until early September to prepare.

Should I even bother trying?

1302987241.0,16,self.learnmath,grntn,Help a depressed Math student in his 2nd semester,esprrr,19,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/grntn/help_a_depressed_math_student_in_his_2nd_semester/,"Hello, to begin with, this thread is both about an exercise that I got for next week as it is about the problems of the one solving it, namely me. It will be a little bit extensive, so be warned, however I'll greatly appreciate anyone with the time to listen to me.

The exercise can be seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/comments/grnkw/prove_that_if_fx_0_for_all_x_f_is_concave/)--it's a simple problem demanding to be proven, however it refers to many other problems that I currently have with my studies. I'm a Math student in Germany, currently in my 2nd semester, and I'm struggling with my sheer inability to proof the lemmas that we learn in our lectures. I'm not retarded in the fact that I can follow a proof and understand it in the end, but when it comes to proof something on my own, I'm helpless. Surely, there are sometimes things that are rarely need any effort at all, and with some practice, I know how to prove, say, that this function is continuous, or that it isn't differentiable, or prove some equations by induction, but I can't grasp the idea needed to solve theoretic problems such as the one mentioned.

I sometimes wonder whether I should feel ashamed for not knowing how to prove this problem. It's a sub-problem of up to 5 that we are given weekly and that have mostly to do with proofs. The situation is different in Linear Algebra II (which I also have to attend), meaning that it is mostly clear what to do since it is covered during class. In Calculus II however, we are learning metric spaces right now.

I was fully aware that studying Mathematics can be really frustrating, but recently, it has started to bother me tremendously. Looking at the exercises and not having a clue on what to do kills me up to the point that I get really desperate. I've attended every class since my first semester, wrote down my notes diligently and I have dozens of Math books that I've all had to use sometime. Still I notice that the lecture often covers other topics, and that's why not a single book could help me with all topics of my class.

More precisely, I often look at American ""Calculus"" books and think that the exercises are rather easy, for instance, in Stewart's Calculus book, most of the exercises consist of calculations. That's why I'd rather say that ""Calculus"" in Germany really means ""Mathematical Analysis""--think of Tom M. Apostol's book, this is what we really do most of the time. We are given some theorems and have to prove derived lemmas.

I passed the exam because, in the end, the exam consisted of calculations (integrals, Fourier series and so on) rather than proofs, but we need to answer every weekly exercises to be allowed to take the exam. And it's those exercises that drive me nuts. I always enjoyed Mathematics even during High School, and I was teaching myself advanced topics with books such as ""Elementary Calculus"" (by Keisler). Studying Mathematics has always been my intention, but after the first semester, things look a little bit different now. I wonder if there are people who just ""know"" how to solve these kind of problems--if so, what is there ""secret""? How did they learn this, and how do they study for Math? Otherwise, most of my fellow students solve the exercises in groups, but this is difficult for me since I'd call myself rather shy and intimidated. Getting along with people that I don't know very well is difficult for me. It's not that I don't have any friends, but I know most of my friends since my childhood and unfortunately, they all do other things than studying Mathematics.

Frankly, I really want to study Mathematics, but I start to feel that studying is slowly devouring myself. There are other things I enjoy too, especially playing piano, but I gradually lose touch to these things that I also love, when I read and learn all day. I know I need to change something, but first of all, I need to advance in my studies otherwise the lectures will leave me behind. I'd greatly appreciate any advice that you could give, advice on how to manage my studies, and suggestions about books that could help me. So far, I think these books helped me in one way or another:

* **Spivak's ""Calculus""**--I really like his book, but I also find problems that seem difficult for me. I couldn't follow the book step-by-step though, since the lectures cover different things or in a different order. That's why I could only look for some hints and keywords.
* **Apostol's ""Mathematical Analysis""**--A book that reflects my study the best (I think), covering real analysis, complex analysis and vector-valued functions. Covering metric spaces, point set topology, and so on. However his organization greatly differs from my lectures, and to be honest, it's really demanding, but his exercises also reflect the ones that I have to do.
* **Stewart's ""Calculus (Early Transcendentals)""/""Essential Calculus""**--I always tell myself that I need to use this book to learn the calculating parts of the topics, such as integrals or Taylor series. This book hasn't helped me with any proof however, and I hardly find time to read in it because I'm mostly occupied reading books that do cover proofs.

Dear Reddit, I'm slowly beginning to hate myself for not knowing how to solve my exercises, and I'm desperate to the point that I cannot start afresh because I tell me ""It's no use anyway."" Any help would be greatly appreciated--I try to be strong and to manage my problems, it's not that I think that everyone will be put in my hands without effort, but I need some help in the beginning.",,False,self,t5_2rdi4,False,,,True,t3_grntn,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/grntn/help_a_depressed_math_student_in_his_2nd_semester/,

SquishyFear:

That's easy; when you're doing problems and you are trying to write symbols, don't just be happy with a scribble. Get some scratch paper, write one line trying to perfect that symbol, then when you are doing problems you have all the practice you need to improve. It only gets better. My symbol for partials looked like my 2s but that changed once I concentrated on them. Spacing and organizing is going to be dependent on your style, though. Not everyone has the same logical flow when it comes to writing out problems. Writing math is art. That feeling when you write a perfect integral symbol is awesome.

Why do we need Imaginary numbers ?,queentenobia,17,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/wl8bq/what_do_complex_number_model_why_do_we_need/,"Okay first of all I am a complete noob at math, but I really want to understand what complex numbers stand for. What kind of situation makes us want for roots of negative numbers. What exact real world problem would make us want complex numbers to solve our problems..

There are three things I found ~~confused myself with~~ on the net when I looked for this answer , I cannot say they are true because I am not sure of their validity.

1. Complex numbers represent a way to have algebra for pairs of                    numbers. From what I can understand is a+ib and c+id represent two complex numbers which can now be operated upon by us using algebra defined for complex numbers. This has applications in coordinate geometry  ? Like we can use complex numbers to model coordinate geometry in two planes but what is wrong with the existing Cartesian model? also I am not very convinced about this.. not even sure if its correct. Please don't kill me

2. Complex numbers have an imaginary part and a real part, so I figure
that it can be used to model a system in which there is an imaginary 
part and a complex part. But then what exactly is the need for i^2=-1  ? How exactly does this property help model a situation which has an imaginary part and a complex part. I am wondering if this is to do with the series i forms when you keep on scaling it with i ie. i, -1, -i , 1 , i, -1,.... This repeating pattern somehow seems suspicious o.o;;. It cycling back to the same thing so imaginary numbers can model cyclic
patterns ? But this is related to the Cartesian system is it ? coz that is   more of (x,y) first quad, (-x,y) second quad, (-x,-y) third quad, (x,-y)   fourth quad. If we consider y as i and x as 1 it sorta works out. But what does that mean ? Where is this going ??

3. Complex number model rotation ? Like 1.i^2 = -1. So we rotated 1 by 180 degrees ? so does multiplying by i mean rotation by 90 ? So how does this help us in coordinate geometry ? If I am modelling a+ib and (a,b) each time we multiply by i we see the following :
a+ib
-b+ia
-a-ib
-ia+b
clearly a and b are not behaving the way (x,y) for the Cartesian system work. So what behavior is this modelling now?

I know this may be a very stupid question or something I should have gotten long ago but please do read. I am not a math major so the language in this would be probably irritating to some people, I apologize before hand for that.

I was in a normal 8th grade level math class we were getting into pre-algebra and I wasn't doing really great at it but I wasn't failing horribly either, I was getting C's and D's.

I understand the distribute property of multiplication and if we try to solve -1(1 + -1) by ignoring the convention that two negatives make a positive, we would get -2.

(-1)(1 + -1) = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1)

and then	

(-1)(0) = -1 + -1

which would mean

0 = -2

And because it's impossible for zero to equal -2, we have to adopt the convention of -1 * -1 as being 1.

So now:

(-1)(0) = -1 + 1

0 = 0

which is what we want

Is this just something we have to accept but can never truly visualize in another way?  I mean, I *get* it, but I just find it so weird.  I love how this simple arithmetic can break a person who forgets the convention.  We always had stuff like this on tests to challenge our understanding.

Yay math!,JMile69,14,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/fudg2/going_back_to_school_yay_math/,"So, I am 32 years old and decided to go back to school and study what I truly love, physics and astronomy.  I was a computer science student years ago (over a decade) and hated it.  I never finished my degree.  As expected, this will be math intensive.

I have years ago, gone through all of calc, linear algebra, vector geometry, discrete math etc... But since this was so long ago, I decide to start math from scratch.  So I'm in Calc 1 again, and enjoying it.  I remember everything conceptually, but asking me to pull the quotient rule out of my ass wouldn't have gone well, hence my decision to just restart.

Along with Calc, I'm in an intro physics course, astronomy, and stats/probability.  So basically I'm buried in math and love it.

Naturally I've had to go back and relearn a lot of that basics.  In my own time, i have reviewed everything from 9th grade algebra (I forgot what happens when you raise a number to a negative power) to trig and Pre-Calc.  Obviously by now I had forgotten the binomial theorem among other simple things that come up regularly.

As a result of this, I have been constructing a math bible of sorts.  Basically, it's just a book full of formulas and quick how to do information for people like me who have had the exposure, but have been away from it for a long time.  For one, physically writing down these rules helps me remember them, and two, its just a nice reference.

Oddly, it's been harder to organize then I expected.

It's turned into a hodgepodge of mathematical rules and formulas, there are pages on basic algebra, pages on 2 dimensional motion, pages on calculating orbits, limit rules, trig functions, integrals, gravitation...  Just everything.

The point is, it's useful, but it's incomplete.  I'm constantly finding things to add.  This is acceptable, and kinda the point.  I expect it to be ever changing, but I would like for it to be more complete.

So heres the real questions:

1) Is there some sort of concise general math reference guide out there that I can go through with a more complete listing of rules, definitions and identities?

2) I love math, to get myself re-integrated (ha!) I've gone through most of what people would call high school math in my own time.  What are some other basic math topics I could go back and review for my own personal entertainment and education?

I'm a 2nd year undergrad physics major. I'm pretty strong in physics, and find learning it and doing the problem solving kinda fun. (However, the derivations required have been largely given to us at this point.) 

In calculus I struggle. I tend to learn math very slowly and need to feel like I have a mastery of the material or else I trip myself up with questions as I attempt to do problems. I find going to class largely unhelpful as some parts go too slow and I lose attention... and lots of parts go to fast and I'm trying to figure out how the n-th step was done while the prof is on step n+5. 

I'm very slow to get through proofs from calc. textbooks since there's nothing to imagine except numbers and operations... Whereas physics has real things to sustain my imagination.

My questions are... Is there a way to learn calc. from example based problems- and get to the proof after that? Or am I looking for a shortcut that doesn't exist? Does anyone have any resources/books to recommend?

I also get bummed out easily while doing math due to this sense of inadequacy, so I tend to procrastinate (making things even worse)... So there's this emotional aspect too. Any advice for pushing through this?

My knowledge of the foundations of math is alright, I suppose, but it really needs a little bit of improvement. I didn't put much time into it in high school, but now I've rediscovered what a beautiful subject it can be. 

Basically, here's what I'm aiming to do: I'm planning on delving deeper into Statistics and Economics in the future, and I want to learn as much as possible. I know that Khan Academy is a good site to start with to brush up on the basics and make sure that I have a solid foundation to stand on, but are there any other good sites out there?

I just don't know how.,Corrupt_Reverend,12,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/qb54t/i_work_in_a_metal_shop_and_think_math_can_make_my/,"As the title suggests, I'm looking for an equation to help me at work. For some reason, my higher-ups have decided that I should be the one using the bandsaw as of late. It's usually pretty easy; set angle, measure I-beam/flat bar/angle iron/whatever, turn on hydraulics/coolant/blade, and let it do it's thing.

Lately however, I've been charged with the task of cutting some pretty large diameter pipe. The square cuts aren't too bad (save for trying to muscle a 40' piece of 16""-o.d. schedule 80 into position all by my lonesome), but the angle cuts are a royal PITA.

For whatever reason, our engineers only ever give us the angle of the cut, and one length for the pipe (usually the longer side) on the blueprints. What this means for me is that I have to get the pipe in the saw vices, use a centring head to make a centre line on the top (long side), measure out and mark the length along the centre line, then try to line the blade up sort of like sighting a rifle and cross my fingers and toes that everything is *just right*.

Now for what I think will make my job easier:

[Fig. 1](http://i.imgur.com/Cc4Wr.jpg)

Figure 1 illustrates the parameters I have to work with. The problem lies with the fact that I only have angle ""*a*"", diameter (or height) ""*z*"", and length ""*x*"".

My plan is to find the shorter length ""*y*"", and simply average ""*x*"" and ""*y*"" to find the length of the pipe directly between these two (along the side centre-line) which is where the blade is closest to the pipe at the start of the cut.

To achieve this, I believe the following is all I need to solve for:

[Fig. 2](http://i.imgur.com/ibXO4.jpg)

If I can find Length ""*f*"" using only height ""*z*"" and angle ""*a*"", I can subtract ""*f*"" from ""*x*"" which would give me ""*y*"" which I could just add to ""*x*"" and divide by 2 to give me the length at which the blade enters.

**tl;dr** - [If angle ""*a*"" and height ""*z*"" are given, how do I solve for ""*f*""?](http://i.imgur.com/ibXO4.jpg)

 http://www.amazon.com/Z-Calculus-Barrons/dp/0764144618

But this is not an ad or anything but sort of review. 
I'm in my first year of mechanical engineering and we are starting calculus. So I went to the library and found this book.
Now I'm thinking that it's going to be like a textbook or whatever and I was fine with that but wait, this is different.

The book basically follows the adventures of a town counsel in some fantasy world and they are taking their first steps in discovering calculus and your character kind helps them with it. So you go about learning about the easy calculus stuff in the beginning and it gets applied to the fantasy world's problems. 

So far from what I've read ahead it gets into some pretty complicated 
stuff by the end but I'm not worried because it's read kind of like a novel. The people basically have problems that they couldn't solve before and you follow them around while they discover how calculus can be used. There are also work problems after each chapter that highlight what was done in that chapter. 

They also have EZ algebra and other EZ subjects..

Has anyone else used this book?

""Jonathan is 3 times as old as Ali is today. 48 years ago, Jonathan was 7 times as old as Ali. How old is Ali today?"" 

I've been stuck on this problem and I can't solve it. This has always bothered me when learning math. It seems all I am doing is learning to remember the formulas, not actually solving the problem. Most of the time, I don't even get how the math works, I just put in the formula and it is considered ""solved"". That's how I originally ""solved"" this problem before, as this isn't the first time I've encountered this problem.

Here's how they tell me to solve the problem:

Let x=Ali's age today. (I got this)

Then Jonathan's age today is 3x. (I got this)

48 years ago, Ali's age was x-48. (I got this)

48 years ago, Jonathan's age was 3x-48. (I got lost here,  Normally I would do 7x-48. I would have never thought to bring over the 3x. I will usually forget this and struggle all over again if I encounter this problem again)

We know that 48 years ago, Jonathan was 7 times as old as Ali so:
7(x-48)=3x-48 (wouldn't have done this, because I got lost on that last part)

7x-336=3x-48
7x=3x+288
4x=288
x=72

This usually happens whenever I do math. Sometimes it's evern worse and I can't even begin to solve the problem. I didn't understand how to convert units until I watched that Khan Academy video. 

Is there some kind of mindset you have to be when you do math or something? I always get stuck on some problem and when I see the solution I get completely confused and think: ""You can do that with that number? How?""

Is there something I'm doing wrong?  I feel so stupid when I look at the answer and go: ""Oh, that's how you do it. I would have never thought of that"" and that's what I find myself doing every time. 

I really want to be good in math, but everytime I see someone solve a problem and explain how they got their answer, it looks like some sort of magic and I just remember the formula and say I got it, when I don't really understand it.

So, I guess what I'm asking is, has anyone else experienced this, or does it all come naturally? Is there anything I'm doing wrong? What can I do to get better? (I know keep on doing math works, but when I am doing roughly 3 hours of studying math a day and I still can't understand how to get problems like the above, I start to think something's not right with how I'm doing math.)

In the book, the author proved that the empty set is a subset of any possible set, and here is a paraphrase of his argument:

""Let A be a set. Assume that the empty set is not a subset of A. This implies that there must be such element x that is in the empty set but not in A. However, the empty set does not have any elements, so there cannot exist such an x. Therefore we have a contradiction and the empty set is a subset of A"".

Now, this proof does make sense to me, but I don't feel it's enough. I'll illustrate my problem with an example (I'll use {} for the empty set as it's easier to type that way):

Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Let B = {1, 2, 3, 4, {}}

Now here's the issue. If you were to go element by element, both sets should contain the exact same elements, i.e. both contain numbers from 1 to 4 and by our statement that every set contains the empty set, A also contains the empty set, which is also in B. Therefore the sets should be equal. However, if you count the number of elements, then A has 4 and B has 5. So A equals B but they are of different size? Doesn't really make much sense to me.

So what am I missing? Or is it so that A actually has 5 elements, but we usually just ignore the empty set? Or is this one of those inconsistencies within math?",,False,self,t5_2rdi4,False,,,True,t3_1fvcm7,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1fvcm7/high_school_sets_having_trouble_understanding_how/,

I think I've made some progress on this problem, but I'm curious if anyone else has any ideas.

What I have so far is let's call the 6 digits that form a 2x3 rectangle a,b,c,d,e,f. Then the number abcdef can be expressed as 100000a+10000b+1000c+100d+10e+f.

It seems to me that some of the formulas are chosen because they are useful methods to produce a result that ""means something"" to us as human beings, not because they are immutable laws. (This last statement doesn't really apply to probability, of course)

Is that right? Just wondering. Knowing this helps me better understand the problem domain (""learning stats"") that I'm dealing with. Thanks.

However, apart from the fact that I'm pretty sure, *and* that my book agrees with me, Wolfram|Alpha displays my/my book's answer in the ""show steps"" section, just before claiming it's equivalent to its answer ""for restricted values of x"".

The integral is  
sin(3x) / (1 + cos(3x)) dx

Me and my book say the answer is  
-1/3 ln |1 + cos 3x| + C  

W|A says the answer is  
[-2/3 ln (cos(3x/2)) + C](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=int%20sin%283x%29%20%2F%20%281%20%2B%20cos%283x%29%29%20dx)

A first-hand look at exponentially decaying thought processes


The most common isotope of uranium, uranium 238, has a half-life of 1.41x10 17  second, or 4.468 billion years. This means that half of the atoms in a sample will decay in that amount of time.

1 : Write the equation for the decay of U238.

y = a(.5) x
Where X is 4.468 billion years.

2: An unrealistic experiment involves 500 grams of newly-formed uranium 238. The researchers would like to know when the 500g sample will decay to 99.9999% of its value. The experiment starts in January 2010.

500g x .999999 = 499.9995

Inputting that value as y and intersecting it with the original equation gives us 1.4427e-6, or .0000014427.

.0000014427 * 4,468,000,000 = 6,445.9836.

6,445.9836 + 2010 = 8455.9836.

By the end of the year 8445, the sample would have decayed to 99.9999% of its original value.

3: The researchers would also like to know at what year it will be reduced to 400 grams.

y = 400 intersects with 500(.5) x at x=.32192809.

.32192809 * 4,468,000,000 = 1,438,374,706

1,438,374,706 + 2010 = 1,438,376,716 years.

4: The scientists soon realize that, despite predicted advancements in cloning technology, they will be unable able to see the experiment through. This is because, they calculate, in roughly 1 billion years the sun will have grown in intensity that water will evaporate from the earth and soon after that, the atmosphere will burn out. At that point, 1 billion years from now, what will be remaining of the 500g u238 sample?

1 billion years is 22.38137869% of 4.468 billion years. Inputting the decimal version of that percentage, .2238137869, into our graph as the x value gives us 428.1494. By the time the world ends (at least by the time it theoretically ends because of the sun becoming too powerful) the sample will be 428.1494 grams, or 85.62988% of its original value.

5: While out drinking, the scientist suggest that in a billion years or so, time travel would have had to be invented, because, that seems like quite enough time to figure that out. Then, logic would dictate that their clones would be able to utilize time travel to reverse-decay the U238 into its previous isotope, protactinium 238. This would require the U238 to go back to 2010 when it was formed, and then travel even further than that to the point where it was a newly-formed p238 isotope sample. p238 has a half-life of 2.27 minutes. p238 has an isotope mass of 238.054506. u238 has a mass of 238.050783. 

How many years would the clones and the uranium sample have to travel in order to reach that point? How much p238 would you have once you have reached the point when p238 was newly-formed?

Okay, let me just figure out this timeline... time travel always complicates things.

2010: experiment starts with newly formed isotope.
~1,000,002,010: u238 sample enters time travel device accompanied by the scientist clones who I am imagining look like Muppets or something. They travel back in time one billion years to when the u238 was first formed.

They then continue on a bit more and realize that they don’t really understand how these isotopes are formed. If these things have half-lives, it’s not like they simply turn into a different isotope after a period of time, right? Okay, well I am going to assume that as an isotope decays, the mass it loses gets converted into the next isotope in the decay daisy-chain. This is probably not the case, but whatever, it is 6:26am and I am very tired.

So... they travel 1 billion years and 4.54 minutes and they reach their final destination: the u238 has reverted back to new p238. I am not sure how much p238 they have, but I am pretty sure it should be around 500g, as that seems pretty reasonable. 

6: The clones then travel back in the time machine to the year 2010 in order to alert their former selves what a pointless experiment it all is, and how they should probably stop as it is a huge waste of their time and energy. One of the scientists asks his clone for the lottery numbers, the clone reads off some kind of time travel protocol about how that would altar the fabric time and space, and how the universe could possibly implode on itself. The scientist then says “Whatever, just give me the numbers.”

For instance:

[`[;\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}x^i = \frac{x}{1-x}\;\;\;(|x|&lt;1) ;]`](http://www.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%20\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}x^i%20=%20\frac{x}{1-x}\\;\\;\\;\(|x|&lt;1\))

[`[; \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x^i=\frac{1}{1-x}\;\;\;(|x|&lt;1) ;]`](http://www.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x^i=\frac{1}{1-x}\\;\\;\\;\(|x|&lt;1\))

[`[; \sum_{i=0}^{n}x^i = \frac{1-x^{n+1}}{1-x} ;]`](http://www.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sum_{i=0}^{n}x^i = \frac{1-x^{n+1}}{1-x})

[`[; \sum_{i=1}^{n}x^i = \frac{x-x^{n+1}}{1-x} ;]`](http://www.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sum_{i=1}^{n}x^i = \frac{x-x^{n+1}}{1-x})

 I was always getting them confused and remembering the wrong one or not remembering them at all. Then, I realized that there was a general form with arbitrary limits so that you could just plug in whatever starting and ending boundaries you want, and you can easily get any of the above formulas, plus many more:

[`[; \sum_{i=a}^{b}x^i = \frac{x^a-x^{b+1}}{1-x} ;]`](http://www.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sum_{i=a}^{b}x^i = \frac{x^a-x^{b+1}}{1-x})

You can plug in 0, 1, +∞, -∞, or any integer for a and b, and you get the formula you're looking for (assuming x^∞ →0 for |x|&lt;1 and x^-∞ →0 for |x|&gt;1.) This form might be a little harder to memorize, but it's infinitely more useful, in my opinion.

Also, if you're like me and you prefer to derive rather than memorize, here's the derivation for the general formula:

I need a bit of advice on how to go about restrengthening my math skills. I was pretty strong in math up until Algebra II my sophomore year in high school, where things started falling apart because of a combination of a terrible instructor and my own naive decision to rely only on what he taught. Now, I'm a freshman in college and I am currently having trouble with things that most others find commonplace (working with unit circle values and trig functions, numerous tips and tricks for Algebra and Calculus, word problems, specifically in physics). How should I go about fixing my math skills so that I can operate on a comfortable level of skill again? I understand that the process will not happen overnight; I just want to be good at math again. I am currently in Calculus, Vector Geometry and Physics. Thanks a bunch.

TL;DR - How do I fix my math skills in order to understand and work through levels past Algebra II?

I started getting tutoring from a math-major friend who taught it to me very differently than I learned in school; he took a really abstract approach showing me how different pieces fit together logically to make math work. Unfortunately he graduated and left, so I tried enrolling in my university's most basic math class. It just seemed like endless lists of formulas, situations where formulas apply, and math problems repeated forever. It didn't seem like anything was explained; things just happened if you did what you were told. 

I ended up going a non-math-intensive route for my degree (partly because of that experience, partly because I was working full time and commuting 2 hours), but I still encounter data in my personal life or in my continuing studies that seem to scream at me that I could do a lot more with it if I had more training. 

How would I best go about that; what kind of math do I really need to know for my interest? Are there textbooks that teach math in a more abstract or 'philosophical' way? How long do I need to power through low-level stuff before it all starts to come together?

This is my greatest regret and shame in life.

Might be wishful thinking, but I won't know unless I try. I'm a hobbyist programmer so that gives me a little more confidence. 

I've been using Khan Academy so far, and while the videos themselves are great I'm beginning to suspect the playlist and order in which they recommend exercises might be a little wonky sometimes. Of course it just may be because I'm stupid. 

As an example on the [exercise dashboard](http://www.khanacademy.org/exercisedashboard) they have sets dealing with radical equations grouped together under 'exponents and radicals', which comes before any sort of preliminary algebra.

Now here is my reasoning on the solution. Since you see only one face, you can imagine out of 6 faces, 3 are red and 3 are blue. If you see a blue face its a 1/3 chance of being the blue face on the red/blue and 2/3 of being one of the faces on the blue/blue.

I explained my reasoning to him after class and he said no, you should be thinking of it like it is cutting the possible cards down to red/blue and blue/blue. Blue/blue is 1 out of 2 so its a 50 percent chance that it is the one you choose.

A few questions/concepts stumping me on the practice test:

**abs(x+3) &lt; 7**

pretty sure the answer is x&lt;4, just would like someone to confirm or correct that





**Would the square root of (a^2 + b^2) just be a+b, or would it be + and - a+b, or something else**





 **And the one that's annoying me the most at the moment:**

x-3(x+7)
I plugged it into wolfram alpha and it said -2x-21, which is one of the choices. But how does that work? Do you not just foil it?

I've got an exam in a few days time, and I'm going through the theory now, and the proofs I have for the Sylow theorems are either incomplete or I don't understand them. I've tried looking online and the proofs I find are completely different to what's given in the lecture, I'd rather submit the proofs given.

So I'd like to take you through the proofs we were given, explaining where I get lost/what doesn't make sense to me, and hopefully somebody familiar with the proof/group theory in general is able to help!

For a group G, |G|=n=p^(k)m, gcd(m,p)=1. H a subgroup of G, with |H|=p^(k). If G is abelian, H exists and is unique.

----
**Sylow I** There is at least one Sylow p-subgroup in G.

We need to show existence of H.

* For abelian G it is shown

* Induction on n (assume claim shown for n divisible by p)

Take n=p^(k) and look at the centre Z. We have two options:

1. p divides |Z|

2. gcd(p,|Z|)=1.

Case 1: Let |Z|=p^(e)m1. By Lagrange's theorem, |Z| divides n, e&lt;=k, m1 divides m. Z is abelian so there is a unique Sylow p-subgroup H. 

If e=k then |H|=p^(k).

If e&lt;k, then H is a subgroup of Z, H is normal in G.

Consider the natural projection pi: G--&gt;G/H. |G/H| = p(k-e)m &lt; n. We apply induction.

There is a Sylow p-subgroup **P** in G/H, |**P**| = p^(k-e). Now take P=pi^(-1)(**P**), as pi_p : P--&gt;**P**. |P| = |ker(pi_p)| |**P**| = p^(e)p^(k-e)=p^(k).

Case 2: gcd(p,|Z|)=1. Consider the action of G on itself by conjugation. G is a disjoint union of orbits

O_1, ... , O_L, ... , O_k

where an orbit is a class of conjugate elements. Suppose O_1, ... , O_L are the one-element orbits and the rest two or more. Then the union of one-element orbits is the centre Z.

Thus |G| = |Z| + Sum(O_i) where O_i are the 2-or-more-element orbits.

p divides |G| but p does not divide |Z|, so p cannot divide Sum(O_i) either. So there is an orbit O^(*) with 2 or more elements, with gcd(p,|O^(*)|)=1. Take any g in O^(*), O^(*)=Orb(g). Then by the orbit-stabilizer theorem,

|G| = |O^(*)| |Stab(g)|, where Stab(g) is the centralizer C(g) = {h | ghg^(-1)=h}. So we have found a subgroup C(g) in G, |C(g)| = |G| / |O^(*)|, where |C(g)| is divisible by p^(k) as |O^(*)| is not.

So by induction there is a subgroup P in C(g), with |P|=p^(k).

----

Here I wonder, when it says take n=p^(k), maybe it means take n=p^(k)m? And what does it mean when it says 'assume claim shown for n divisible by p'? Isn't that exactly what we're trying to show?

How do we know there is a Sylow p-subgroup **P** in G/H?

And when it says

&gt;So by induction there is a subgroup P in C(g), with |P|=pk.

What does that have to do with induction? I fear I may have missed the proof entirely as it keeps mentioning induction but I don't see it ever being used.

----

**Sylow II** The number n_p of Sylow p-subgroups satisfies

n_p == 1 mod p

First we show that: For a Sylow p-subgroup P, and a subgroup Q of G with |G|=p^(a), if Q is a subgroup of the normalizer of P in G, then Q is a subgroup of P.

Note P is normal in N(P) by definition. Take the quotient pi: N(P) --&gt; N(P)/P. What is pi(Q)? Take any g in Q, and look on the one hand,

|pi(g)| divides |g| divides |Q|=p^(a) so |pi(g)| is a power of p.

On the other hand, |P| is the max power of p, so |N(P)/P| is coprime to p, thus |pi(g)| must be 1. This means Q is a subset of P.

Anyway, consider the set S={P_1, ..., P_l} of Sylow p-subgroups where l=n_p. Consider the action of G on S by conjugation. It has the decomposition into orbits

S = O_1 union ... union O_L

How many one-element orbits are there?

{P_i} is a one element orbit if and only if P is a subgroup of N(P), if and only if P=P_i.

There is just one 1-element orbit {P} and all other orbits consist of (p_i)^(a_i) elements, a_i &gt;0.

So n_p = 1 + Sum((p_i)^(a_i)) == 1 mod p.

----

Here we proved that if a subgroup Q satisfies Q=p^(a) and is a subgroup of N(P) then Q is a subgroup of P, but I don't see it used anywhere, although I've no problem proving it.

The main problem with this proof is 

&gt;{P_i} is a one element orbit if and only if P is a subgroup of N(P), if and only if P=P_i.

Does anyone have any idea what that even means? No other proof that I found seemed to do it exactly this way, but there is not even another P mentioned, so I probably copied that wrong? 

And why do the other orbits have (p_i)^(a_i) elements? What are the p_i? I thought we considered one prime at a time.

Also, how are we able to define the action of G on S, before proving that conjugating a Sylow p-subgroup gives another Sylow p-subgroup?

----

**Sylow III** If P is a Sylow p-subgroup and H is a subgroup of G, |H|=p^(e), then H is a subgroup of gPg^(-1) for some g in G. All Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate.

Consider all Sylow p-subgroups conjugate to the Sylow p-subgroup Q. B={Q_1, ..., Q_b} We need to show P is an element of B, for Sylow subgroup P.

Consider the action of P on B by conjugation, and decompose into orbits:

B = O_1 union ... union O_L

|B| = Sum[i=1 to L](O_i). b is the number of subgroups conjugate to Q: b = |G|/|N(Q)|, but Q is a subgroup of N(Q) so p^(k) divides N(Q). So p does not divide b.

So b = Sum[i=1 to L](O_i) implies there is an O_i with |O_i| not divisible by p.

So this {O_i} is a one-element orbit.

P is a subgroup of N(O_i) implies P=O_i.

----

Firstly, what I don't get is why the proof ends there. It doesn't seem obvious to me why P=O_i should imply all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate?

I also don't understand, why is b=|G|/|N(Q)|? Why does Q in N(Q) imply p^(k) divides |N(Q)|? 

----

I'm sorry for such a long post, but I don't know if it's how the proof was delivered or how I copied it, but none of my classmates have anything better than me. My lecturer hasn't posted anything online.

Sorry in advance :o(. Please reply in not-LaTeX format.

As the title implies, I have trouble with multiple integrals.

My first question is: When converting integrals to other coordinates, such as rectangular coordinates to polar, rectangular to cylindrical, rectangular to spherical, do you always need to sketch it to ascertain the new coordinates? I ask this because I can't figure out how to sketch 3-D graphs most of the time, and I've had sessions with counselors to help me but it just does not make sense to me.

I'm aware there are equations (x = r cos(theta), x = rho cos(theta) sin(phi), etc.) but given the problems I have, I can't figure out the angles using those equations. 

Example problems I have:

(1) Change to spherical coordinates and evaluate the integral:

The triple integral of: ze^(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) dzdydx

from [-3, 0] [0, √9 - x^2 ] [0, √9 - x^2 - y^2 ]. (For clarity, the coordinates for dx is [-3, 0], dy is  [0, √9 - x^2  ]...)

I already know the correct answer. I understand that rho is from [0,3]. I also understand that theta is from [pi/2, pi] because I sketched the graph on the xy-plane and the integrated region is between those two angles and it's where x is from [-3, 0]. But why is phi from [0, pi/2]? The 3D graph looks like an upside down bell. I have no idea how you're supposed to ascertain the coordinates from that, either. And again, is there a way to figure out the coordinates without graphing?

How do you know which order of integrate to pick when it comes to 3-D integrals? I always just guessed.

(2) Change the following integral so spherical coordinates (DO NOT EVALUATE)

Triple D Integral of: x dV, where the region D is the region in the octant x&gt;= 0, y &gt;=0, and z&gt;=0 that lies inside the sphere x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9. Are the bounds as followed: p is [0,3] theta is [0, 2pi] and phi is [0, pi/2]? And the order of integration? Is it possible to be in multiple octants at once, and if so, how do you find the coordinates in that case?

Our total rent is 1185. What we have been doing (as far as I understand, my friend has a pretty complicated (to me) formula that he uses that I don't quite understand) is we would both pay half and then split up my GF's third with me usually getting 200 and him getting 175 from him. This comes out to about 387 for my GF and I and him at 412 but it seems he is only paying 25 extra for his larger bedroom and private bathroom. He gave me his formula below:

Proof: (1/2(x+50)+1/2(x-50))=((1/3(x-25))(1/3(x-25))(1/3(x+50)))

To me it seems he is reducing 25 out of both of ours and adding 50 to his.

Here's the premise: in this game I can build stuff with resources that I dig/mine/grow.  The resources are wood, clay, iron, and wheat.  Just to keep things simple, let's stick with two resources for now, wood and clay.

I (currently) produce wood at one of three rates: 549, 675, or 969 units per hour (u/hr).  I also produce clay at one of those same rates.  If I produce wood at 549 u/hr, then I produce clay at 959 u/hr.  The inverse is also true - if I produce wood at 969 u/hr, I produce clay at 549 u/hr.  I can produce *both* wood and clay at 675 u/hr.  I can change production rates at any time without penalty.

Now like I said, I can build stuff with the wood and the clay.  Let's say for example that I want to build a Palace.  For argument's sake, we'll say that a palace costs 500 wood and 600 clay.  We'll also assume that I'm starting with 0 wood and 0 clay.

The challenge is: at what rates, and for what duration, should I produce wood and clay which *minimizes* the amount of time it takes to produce 500 wood and 600 clay?  I've been fiddling around with some equations, but my math is really rusty and I'm not coming up with anything useful.  I don't know if this can be solved algebraically or if it requires calculus (which I'm *really* rusty with).

The test is for 5th and 6th graders, so I believe it should be solvable with techniques that are introduced either there or 7th grade at the most (i.e., no Algebra, high school geometry, etc.) Here's the problem:

A right triangle with legs of length 6 cm and 8 cm was cut out of a paper and then folded along a straight line. Which of the numbers below can express the area of the resulting polygon? 

A) 9 cm² 
B) 12 cm² 
C) 18 cm² 
D) 24 cm² 
E) 30 cm² 

I found out that the correct answer is C, but I don't know why. 
For what it's worth, my daughter was able to figure out on her own that D and E were incorrect, since the starting triangle had an area of 24cm^2 and the polygon after the fold couldn't be smaller than that. I calculated what the area of each triangle would be if I folded the paper perpendicular to the hypotenuse, but in doing so had to use Algebra to solve for the length of the folded side, which again, I think is beyond what is expected of 5th and 6th graders. Also, neither one of those areas worked out to 18cm^2 anyway.

I'm also not entirely sure I understand what they mean by ""resulting polygon"". If the straight line were parallel to the hypotenuse, for example, the resulting polygon would look a bit like a sailboat with a triangle and a parallelogram. I haven't tried to calculate the area of that shape (maybe that's the next step?), but the sailboat shape isn't even the only possible shape.

1302761306.0,8,self.learnmath,gppj2,What would happen if you were in a 3-torus and you tied a rope to itself end-to-end and tried to change its orientation? (detail inside),SnailHunter,9,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/gppj2/what_would_happen_if_you_were_in_a_3torus_and_you/,"I posted this in /r/AskScience but didn't get any responses. I think it was probably more of a math question anyway. Here's the scenario:

You're in a 3-torus in which you can travel in one particular direction 10 feet before you reach your starting point. In a direction perpendicular to that direction, you can travel 30 feet before reaching your starting point. [Here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/hFrt0.png) I made to hopefully help illustrate this. The picture can be thought of as a ""room"" in which each pair of opposing sides of the room are glued together. That is, the ceiling is glued to the floor, the front wall is glued to the back wall, and the right wall to the left. In other words, if you are in the center of the room and walk towards the left wall, you will walk through it and re-emerge through the right wall, eventually ending up back where you started. Same thing with the front and back walls, and also with the ceiling and floor.

Now imagine you have a rope that is just a little over 10 feet long (a little extra so you can tie it), and you tie it to itself end-to-end along the direction in which you go 10 feet before ending up back at your starting point. You tie it so that it is taut as shown in [this pic](http://i.imgur.com/FInXh.png) (I drew the rope's shadow in gray on the floor as well to hopefully make it more clear).

Now for the question: what would happen if you tried to turn the now-taut rope (you could equivalently replace the rope with a 10-foot rigid rod whose two ends were taped together) to change its orientation so that it was aligned with the direction in which you travel 30 feet before ending up back where you started (the horizontal direction in the pic)? [See new pic.](http://i.imgur.com/LkQtc.png)

I'm guessing the rope wouldn't budge if you attempted this, since it's shorter than the length of the space it would have to occupy to remain tied to itself, but *what* exactly would be stopping you from re-orienting it? Is it the space itself? If you're feeling an opposing force to the attempted rotation, where is this force coming from? Would this mess with conservation laws at all? Is the opposing force somehow the tension in the rope itself? I'm imagining that as you turned it, the tension in the rope would keep increasing until it eventually snapped.

Also, what about the reverse case where you start out with a 30-foot rope (along the 30-foot axis) and attempted to re-orient it so that it was parallel with the initial orientation of the 10-foot rope illustrated above? Would this be possible?

And one final scenario, just for clarity: what if the dimensions of the room were completely uniform (each one was 10 feet)? Would you be able to freely spin a rope tied to itself end-to-end, re-orienting it in any direction you wish? I'm guessing the answer is still no, since the diagonal in any square is longer than any one of its sides.",,False,self,t5_2rdi4,True,,,True,t3_gppj2,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/gppj2/what_would_happen_if_you_were_in_a_3torus_and_you/,

What is the answer to this question?

6 ÷ 2(1+2) = ?

Now I know parentheses first, then multiplication/division then addition/subtraction for this question. So that would tell me:

6 ÷ 2(1+2) = 6 ÷ 2(3) = 6 ÷ 2 × 3 = (6 ÷ 2) × 3 = 3 × 3 = 9

My friend thinks that the parentheses coming first rule means that it's this:

6 ÷ 2(1+2) = 6 ÷ 2(3) = 6 ÷ (2 × 3) = 6 ÷ 6 = 1

I thought this too at first, but then I assumed that the 2(1+2) is just a shortcut for omitting the multiplication sign and that it does not change the order of operations.

Which is technically right?

I'm trying to test out a 'drop chance' method that I wrote in Java but I'm not entirely sure if I'm doing the math correctly. I'm pretty dumb when it comes to math so I just wanted to get a second opinion on it and maybe see if there was a faster/easier way to do what I'm trying to do.

Basically I get the program to loop, one million times, through a simulated monster kill. Whenever a randomly generated 'drop number', which is between 0.0 and 100.0, is equal to or less than the 'drop chance' of the item then the number of loops that the simulation had to go through to reach that number is added up and put into one of the spaces on a million space table.

When the simulation finishes running one million times it goes through the table and adds all the numbers together and then divides by one million to get the average number of simulated monster kills it took for an item with a specific 'drop chance' to drop.

So, am I doing the averages properly?

            int p = 0;
    		
    		//Loops one million times.
    		for(int z=0;z&lt;1000000;z++) {

If someone has a few minutes to check them over and see if I made any errors that would help alot. ^.^

-----------------------------------------------------
Question #1 - Differentiate
-

* Y = (e^4x ) / (x^2 + 1) 
* Y' = (f'g - fg') / g^2
* Y' = ((e^4x (4)) (x^2 + 1) - (e^4x )(2x + 0)) / (x^2 + 1)^2
* Y' = (4e^4x x^2 + 1 - e^4x 2x) / (x^2 + 1)^2
* Y' = e^4x ( (4x^2 + 1 - 2x) / (x^2 + 1)^2 )
* Y' = e^4x ( (4x^2 - 2x + 1) / (x^2 + 1)^2 )


----------------------------------------------------
Question #2 - Differentiate
-

* Y = √(x + e^1-x^2 )
* Y = (x + e^1-x^2 )^1/2
* Y' = 1/2 (x + e^1-x^2 )^-1/2 (1 + e ^ 1-x^2 (-2x))
* Y' = 1/2(x + e^1-x^2)^-1/2 (-2x-2xe^1-x^2 )
* (-2x-2xe^1-x^2 ) / 2√(x + e^1-x^2 )

----------------------------------------------
Question #3 - ????
-

* This one took me forever and was extremely confusing with all of the brackets...
* If f(x) = e^-x cos2x, find f''(0)
* Y(x) = e^-x cos2x
* Y'(x) = f'g + fg'
* Y'(x) = (e^-x (-1))(cos2x)+(e^-x )(-sin(2x)(2))
* Y'(x) = -e^-x cos2x + e^-x(-2sin2x)
* Y''(x) = (f'g + fg') + (f'g + fg')
* Y''(x) = [(-e^-x (-1))(cos2x) + (-e^-x)(-sin(2x)(2))] + 
[(e^-x (-1))(-2sin2x) + (e^-x )(-2sin(2x)(2))]
* Y''(x) = [e^-x cos2x - e^-x (-2sin2x)] + [-e^-x (-2sin2x) + e^-x (-4sin2x)]
* Y''(x) = e^-x [cos2x+2sin2x+2sin2x - 4sin2x]
* Cross out the 2sin2x's and the 4sin2x...
* Y''(x) = e^-x [cos2x]
* Now put in the number zero and see what comes out...
* Y''(0) = e^-(0) [cos2(0)]
* Y''(0) = 0

When I researched it I found the Gamma Function, and Pi function, but neither made any sense back then.

Well, even with BC calc under my belt, it's still very advanced for me. It's mainly the notation that's causing me trouble I think. I don't understand what actually occurs if you, say, plug in z = 2 in G(z). Or how the gamma function allows you to compute half-factorials? 

I'm just looking for someone to try to explain it to me in a simpler way than the very-formal format of wikipedia and other sites. Also, Does the Gamma Function allow us to find the derivative at any point along the graph, and if not, is it possible to find the derivative at an integer? 

Also, Could you find the area under the curve that is projected from y = x!? Since 0! = 1 and 1! = 1, it seems the projected curve would just be a straight line from 0 to 1 at y = 1, meaning the area under that curve would be 1, but is (0.5)! = 1?

What's the difference between the Gamma Function and Pi function?

I've seen things like G(z) = (z-1)!, but I've seen no examples of uses of this. Say I wanted to find G(4.5), how might I go about that? Also, I recall one website showing something where finding the half-factorials results in the square root of pi, along with some other stuff.

I said that because lim{x-&gt;0} (x+x^(2)) = 0, and anything multiplied by 0 is 0, the limit has to be 0.  
  
Here are the reasons she gave me for not giving me any points:  
  
* I didn't use the squeeze theorem. (The instructions didn't specify what method to use.)  
  
* 0*∞ isn't always 0, and if the limit of sin(π/x) was infinite, the limit could have been different. (I told her I didn't see any reason to consider that since sine is bounded from -1 to 1, but she said she couldn't count my answer right unless I actually stated that on the exam.)

Let's say you started a film club, where each member chooses their 10 favorite movies, and you take turns watching them.  Now, you'd assume the number of movies would be 10 times the number of members; however, as with any top 10 lists, there's bound to be some overlap.  Assuming any two people will have two or three movies in common (for the sake of math, let's call it 2.5), how many different movies would you expect for a group of some arbitrary size?

Now, my instinct was (and this could be the complete wrong way of going about this) was that the solution would involve combinatorics and expected value, ie, assuming the lists are random, there's some chance that two peoples' lists will overlap, and you'd expect on average to have 2.5 overlaps.

After playing around for a while, I realized that if you wanted to compare someone's list to an existing list, you could treat it as a ""picking balls out of a hat"" problem.  That is, you could think of all the movies that had already been picked as ""marked balls"", and the newest member is picking their top 10 out of a pool of marked and unmarked balls.  And, again, you'd expect them to pick on average 2.5 marked balls, assuming there were 10 marked balls (one previous top 10 list) to begin with.

So, it was an ""n choose k"" problem.  Except I didn't know what n was.  However, I realized I had every other piece of the puzzle, so the search for n became my quest.  Thinking about it in terms of the real world, it's like this: if people, on average, pick the same movie 2.5 times, that means they're picking out of a fixed pool of size n.  So, it's at this point that the expected value part comes in.

By making it into an expected value problem, the equation looks like this:

    [; \sum_{1}^{10}x*p(x)=2.5 ;]

That is, the probability that you have x movies in common times that number of movies, for every possibility from 1 to 10.  The probability equation I came up with is as follows:

    [; \frac{\frac{10!}{(10-x)!}*\frac{(n-10)!}{(n+x-20)!}}{\frac{n!}{(n-10)!}} ;]

It's a little ugly, but basically it's the number of ways to choose x of the 10 marked balls out of n total balls, times the number of ways to choose 10-x (the number of movies that you chose that haven't already been chosen) of the n-10 (total balls minus the 10 marked balls) unmarked balls.  If you combine the two and do a little simplification, you end up with:

    [; \frac{10!*(n-10)!^{2}}{n!}\sum_{1}^{10}\frac{x}{(10-x)!*(n+x-20)!}=2.5 ;]

Now, I don't know if this is a problem you can solve algebraicly, but at this point I decided to just guess and check.  However, when I plugged in an arbitrary guess of n=40, the result I got, around .04, seems way low.  Thinking about it logically, this means that if two people each picked 10 movies out of a pool of 40, you'd only expect them to have .04 in common.  That can't be right, but I can't figure out what I did wrong.

Unfortunately, even though I began to understand the material, my teacher is a douchebag. Because I didn't write the answers (though they were correct) in his format, I failed yet another test. I brought it up to him, and instead of just admitting that I wrote it in a format he didn't like, he kept telling me that my answers were just wrong. But I know they were right. He said the answer to a problem was x = (infinity, -3)U(3, infinity). I wrote, ""x = |R - (-3,3)"". Same thing. X is equal to all real numbers except for those between -3 and 3. 

So basically, I'm failing because my teacher doesn't like me at this point. Other students had the same answer I did and had the question marked right, and I brought this up to him but he literally told me to ""sit down and keep your mouth shut."" I have tried talking to the Math Dean, but he insinuated that I'm a racist because I said that it's hard to focus in lectures because I can't understand what the teacher is saying because of the strong French-Canadian accent, and disregarded every other part of that email.... Oh, except for where I mentioned that I can't get out-of-class help because the teacher doesn't check his email. For that he replied that, ""it's the student's responsibility to get additional help outside of class. That professor does not have a phone number or office hours listed because he is not required to be available outside of class time."" Which I have NEVER had before. All teachers I've always had have been available outside of class time.

So I'm rambling. Forgive me, but I'm very emotional about it because I'm disappointing my mother by dropping another class this semester. Also, math was the only thing I felt competent in last semester, so this semester has dug up the foundation of my self-worth as a student. 


Again, I just wanted to thank you all for helping me. I know in my heart I should have passed that test with at least an 86%, and I had proof of it thanks to you.

Recently I've been asked by a professor to code up an eigenvector solver for the lab. So far my program has no trouble getting the eigenvalues and now I'm trying to code up the part that calculates the eigenvectors. My problem comes when I get repeated eigenvalues and I was hoping someone here could help me.

I'm setting up my program to solve for x, y and z (it's a 3x3 matrix) using Gauss elimination. When plugging the eigenvalues back into the matrix I end up with three equations, but the bottom one is just 0=0. I then pick an arbitrary number (1) for z and use that value to get y and x. As far as I can tell this is fine.

But if I have repeated eigenvalues then I start getting confused. For two repeated eigenvalues I end up with two equations that are just 0=0. Does this mean I get to arbitrarily specify what z AND y are, then I just solve for x?

What if all three eigenvalues are the same? Then all equations reduce to 0=0. If I get to arbitrarily pick z, y and x then that means any vector I can come up with is an eigenvector. Is this true?

Basically, the previous university I went to was a joke. The calculus class was incredibly easy and several levels below the calculus class that they offer at my current school. My calculus credits transferred and I was enrolled in a calculus 2 course in my current university. I forgot a bunch of topics covered in calculus over the summer due to me not practicing it. 

Right now, my grades aren't too great in calculus 2. I passed my first quiz with a 94 and failed my first exam and second quiz with horrific grades.

I'll get into a little background on my professor. He knows the material very well but he covers it very quickly and expects the students to know all previous material already leading up to that topic. Although he moves fast, he seems very generous. I feel like if you do all his online homework and attend all the classes and make it seem like you're putting in effort he'll pass you. While I like the idea of that, I don't really like the idea that I'll pass the class and know very little about the material that was covered. It will really hurt me in future classes. 

In class, we just finished improper integrals and we will be moving on to sequences. While the class is moving forward, I'm still trying to get a grasp on material we already covered.

I have a general understanding of integrals. However, trig substitution and complicated integration by parts problems are killing me because I don't have the trig properties and integrals memorized yet. And this is the point at which I'm stuck.

I have my second exam coming up in about 2 1/2 weeks.

Here are my options: 

* I have a general understanding of integrals. I can continue studying the topics we covered in my free time leading up to the exam until I could do them without any problems. 

* I can drop the course and spend the next 4 months relearning everything in my calculus book starting from chapter 1 and then just retake the course in the spring with a much better understanding of the topic.

I've recently become interested in math, 10 years after I had it in school, and have been plowing through khanacademy's exercises. I don't have a particular goal with my math endeavours (e.g. passing school tests), it's more like a hobby, although I do hope to get to university level and beyond.

Now, since I'm doing this completely by myself (no teachers, no tests), I need a *system* designed to make sure that I go through the material in a pedagogical order; one that doesn't skip anything important, and makes sure that I have the fundamentals to learn each new step. This system must obviously force me to do (well written) exercises until I get it - simply reading about math won't do much good, as I think anyone would agree with.

Up until now, I've thought khanacademy was the answer to this. It's exercises coupled with the related videos has made me go through most of algebra and trigonometry in light speed, using the following system:

1. Try to do a new exercise.
2. (optional) Watch the related videos if 1. failed (or if I'm just interested.)
3. Repeat.

This worked up until I got to an exercise where I was supposed to do vector operations with complex numbers. Now, complex numbers had not come up yet, and as far as I can see, will not come up. I'm guessing this is because there's no exercises for it *yet*, and that it will at some point, but that doesn't help me right now. (Of course, they have video lessons on it, but I don't want to be in a situation where I have to look for exercises myself, as I don't neccessarily know what I'm doing, if that makes sense.)

So that brings the question - have anyone here successfully gotten through the whole khanacademy curriculum without supplemental resources? Will the exercises be enough? Will I know linear algebra like my inner pockets when I'm done?

I've read that Edexcel Core Maths series are both thorough and of good quality. Is something like that better? Any other book series that I should look at instead? I should be done with the algebra and trigonometry modules pretty soon, so anything around that level and upwards.

I was wondering if you, reddit, could give me some hints on what I did wrong or if I even came close to proving this at all (DON'T GIVE ME THE PROOF.). This is my best attempt and I don't want to look at the proof in the book until I am sure i've done it.

Question:
Suppose S is an ordered set with the least upper bound property, B is a subset of S, B is not empty, and B is bounded bellow. Let L be the set of all lower bounds of B. Then
a=sup(L) exists in S
a=inf(B) which also exists in S.

My attempted proof:
Since S is an ordered set with the least-upper-bound-property, sup(B) exists in S. This implies that if x=sup(B) then every y&lt;x in B must also be in S. There must then be a y in B such that  every k&lt;y is not in B but is in S (since B is bounded below). The largest such value k must equal inf(B) which is also in S.

Also another question: When you try to prove something how the hell do you know if you really proved it? This bothers me a lot.

&gt; Nine horses are entered in a horse race. If you “box” three
horses (three are chosen and they can finish in any of the first 3 positions in
the race), determine the probability that you will hold the winning ticket.
  
The answer given in the back is 1 / 14 (or 6 / 84). We say 1 / 84.
  
We all interpret this question to mean that you pick three horses from the nine, and if your three horses are in the top three in any order, then you win.
   
I think it should just be *1 / C(9,3)* since there are that many ways to pick 3 unique ""boxes"" and your box must be one of them. As well, the boxes all have the same probability of occurring, no?
  
Another way to look at it is *3! / P(9,3)* where the denominator gives the number of ways that any three horses of the 9 can be arranged in the top 3, and the numerator gives the number of ways that your box can be arranged in the top 3.  
  
A third and final way of thinking of it is: your first horse has a 3/9 chance of being in the top 3, your second horse 2/8, your third horse 1/7, and you take the product of those three.
  
All three methods give the same answer but it's still not equal to the answer in the back or [what this forum poster gives](http://mathhelpforum.com/statistics/30081-impossible-prob-question-help.html).

I was wondering if anyone here has any advice or experience in studying advanced mathematics at a ""later"" age. My last true math class was Calculus I in high school and again in college but did not put much effort into either. I understand the basics of derivatives/integrals, but that is about it. I have a business degree from a fairly rigorous university, so have some experience with probability, statistics, and game theory. But beside that, I haven't opened a calculus book since freshman year. I am thinking about going back to school and am considering STEM fields that would require a good bit of math. I guess I am at a crossroads in that I find the concepts and applications of advancement mathematics intriguing, but have always found the actual math tedious. It is also quite daunting to think of the amount math that would be needed for say a masters in statistics or financial engineering (linear algebra, analysis, and so on). Even if I don't pursue a career in STEM, I think it would be interesting to challenge my brain. My big question is whether I would ever be able to get to a point where I can comfortably comprehend this stuff, or if I will just keep going around in circles with my eyes glazed. I know I'm not going to be a math genius anytime soon, but it really does seem you either have a knack for this sort of math or you don't, and so far I don't. Has anyone else delved into such math “late” in life and found they really got into it?

My plan is to take a random x coordinate that is the diameter of the circle, and do some fudging so that I get that values distance from the center.

Then I do something, using some ratio or something (here is where I need help) to find the possible values for the y coordinate.

So for example, if the circle is 10, I find at first a random number between 0 and 10. 

Case 1.  I get 10, so the possible values for y are 0 deviations from the center.

Case 2. I get 5, so the Y range is 10, the deviation from the center can be 5. Not so hard.

Case 3. I get 7.5, so the y range is the value of the line from the top of the circle at x of (center(5) + 2.5) and the bottom. I figured that to be 
about square root of 50. Not so bad.

Case 4. This is where is am confused, how would I calculate this if it wasn't such an easy circumstance, like 1.3, 2.6, 7.9, or 9.1? It doesn't seem that hard,it's just my math skills are really rusty( and I never really learned it very well in the first place).

How do I find the length of y in relation to the length of x?

Anyway, my problem is this - I'm absolutely lost as to how to apply Bayes' rule, why does it work or what does it mean exactly. For example, there's this famous exercise:

&gt;The probability that one has cancer is 0.001 | P(C) = 0.001

&gt;The probability that one doesn't have cancer is 0.999 | P(¬C) = 0.999

&gt;If you take a cancer test, and you have cancer, there's 0.8 probability the test comes out positive. | P(pos|C) = 0.8

&gt;If you take a cancer test and you don't have cancer, there's 0.1 probability the test comes out positive. | P(pos|¬C) = 0.1

&gt;I have received a positive test result. What's the probability that I have cancer?

&gt;( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ6Jg1wS604 )

I first calculated the non-normalized probability, which is P(pos|C)*P(C) = 0,0008

Then I'm not sure what to do - since I received a positive test result, I thought I should then calculate P(pos|¬C)\*P(C) (I have no idea what I'm doing), and the correct step is apparently P(pos|¬C)\*P(¬C), and I have no idea why. (Then I thought correctly that I should add the probabilities and then divide each probability by the sum, as to normalize it)

There was also another exercise, which went like this:

&gt;I have two coins, one of them is fair, one of them is loaded. The chance of throwing heads on the loaded one is 0.1. The chance of selecting each coin is 0.5.

&gt;I threw a randomly selected coin, and it turned up heads. What's the probability that I selected a fair coin?

I've been a professional game developer for over a decade, working primarily on engine code (graphics systems and such).  Although I work with certain high school / undergraduate level mathematical concepts almost every day (such as linear algebra), it's mostly been on a very practical level; I felt like I scraped my way through those classes in school, and only started finally ""getting"" anything when I could understand how they could apply to getting pretty graphics on the screen.

That said, while I understand the practical merits of certain math topics, there's always been something more fundamental about the mathematical universe in general that I've never truly gotten, but would very, very much like to, and that's the motivation behind exploring pure mathematics itself.

I like abstraction, a lot.  Probably more than I should, actually.  Doing game engine work is a constant balance of finding meaningful abstractions that will help a wide variety of game problems get solved, without over-abstracting and over-engineering everything into a unnecessary mess.  With that said, I spend a large chunk of my time in my head, visualizing data structures and spaces and how different concepts relate.  I'm guessing that some of the inherent draw I feel in my work is similar to the draw felt by mathematicians exploring new ideas, and there's probably some decent mental overlap worth exploring.

Around a year ago (give or take) I ran across ""Lockhart's Lament"", and shortly afterwards ran into a copy of the Princeton Companion to Mathematics.  The latter is almost entirely above my current knowledge level, but it made me realize how uncomfortable I am with my level of mathematical awareness... not so much in a raw knowledge sort of way (it's a huge subject, who would I be trying to compare myself to, really?) but my lack of inherent awareness in why this is interesting in the first place, despite my love of abstraction in another conceptual field.

To put it simply: How do I explore the world of mathematics without feeling like I'm falling into an endless cavern of irrelevant solipsism?  If you happen to have read Greg Egan's novel ""Diaspora"", the analogy of the ""truth mines"" is what I'm going for here; I feel like if I start digging into pure math without having an eventual physical underpinning, that it'd be the equivalent of exploring a cave that goes on forever, but has no light connecting it to the outside world.

The fact that so much of math is based on the rigor of building on previously well-established discoveries is helpful, in the sense that it prevents things from becoming truly solipsist (due to the common mental foundation that everyone shares as a concept becomes rigorously proven), however that still hasn't managed to shake my feeling of ""but... why?  Where is this going?  Why dig into this cave that never ends?  What truth are you hoping to find?""

I'm probably not expressing myself as well on this question as I would like, but given that my concern (and corresponding ignorance) is of an intuitive rather than mental nature, it is unlikely that I would ever find the proper words for my question.  But I'm hoping that at least one of you out there reads this, and intuitively recognizes the position I'm standing in right now and can help me bridge this gap:  Why study this?  Why?  There's a whole conceptual world I can see in front of me and am allured by, and I know for certain that if I can see a purpose in it, I will enjoy taking my time to explore it, but that purpose is still hiding from me.

Some background: I have a full tenured professor in charge of my math class (cal 1). He left around week 3 of the class for a 6 week research position in Scandinavia, giving us another professor. Basically, original professor got us partially through the review stuff and that's it. New professor caught us up (class was behind), got us through limits and derivatives, and two tests (good on both). Original professor comes back, teaches us integrals and fundamental theorem.

So Monday we got tested over that material. Previous test averages in the class were 80% for first test (review and limits) and 70% for second test (derivatives). I was well above the average in both. I do my homework. I understand what an integral is.

Class average for 3rd test: 3-fucking-5%. Yes, that is 35%. I got a 38%, which was originally marked as 33%, but he graded that one wrong so is correcting it.

Before the curve he's putting in to save his own ass (20%) not a single soul passed that test. 90% of us still won't pass it. And he's blaming every bit of the failure on us, not on switching professors twice, not on his being a terrible teacher, not on him contradicting himself multiple times on content...

He is so bad (just from the 3 weeks we had with him) that we (as a class) tried to get the temp professor to be able to stay. That guy was great. He explained things clearly and you could read what he wrote. We were told, no, we have to get our original professor back.

The JPL has a paper describing how to do this at [1]. However, the coordinates I get are nothing like orbit diagrams that you can see on other places, for example here [2]. This means the ecliptic X,Y coordinates I get are wrong. According to [2], Jupiter currently has positive X,Y coordinates, however what I get are negative X and positive Y. So I would really appreciate it if someone can take a look at what I'm doing wrong here.

In reference to the paper, I'll use these variable names:

* Lp for longitude of perihelion (omega with a bar on top)
* Lan for longitude of ascending node (capital Omega)
* p for argument of perihelion (omega)

Also, I'll say ""dsin"" when I mean sine for degrees, and ""sin"" when I mean sine for radians, same with dcos/cos, because it's good to be clear on that.

So, step 1, calculate the time and the initial values for the elements. Today's Julian Date is 2455880.89156. 

    T = (2455880.89156 - 2451545.0) / 36625

    Lan = 100.47390909 + T * 0.20469106 
        = 100.49820801510504

Step 2, calculate argument of perihelion `p` and mean anomaly `M`:

    p = Lp - Lan
      = 14.753708923445224 - 100.49820801510504 
      = -85.7444990916598

    M = L - Lp

       = 379.8981764066399

Step 3, iterate the solution to Kepler's equation to get the eccentric anomaly `E`. I'll use the variable `ee` to mean eccentricity in degrees. (Which is a bit strange to do!) And `dM` for delta M, `dE` for delta E.

    ee = e * 57.29577951308232

      = 19.89817640663989

    E0 = M + ee * dsin(M)

       = 20.841430173809666 + 0.04479708248597786 
       = 20.886227256295644

Another time:

    dM = M - (E1 - ee * dsin(E1))
       = 19.89817640663989 - (20.886227256295644 - 2.7714259217983446 * dsin(20.886227256295644)) 
       = -3.0158494723764306e-07

    dE = dM / (1 - e * dcos(E1))
       = -3.0158494723764306e-07 / (1 - 0.0483705073105 * dcos(20.8882775994)) 
       = -3.1585908479554074e-07

    E2 = E1 + dE 
       = 20.886227256295644 + -3.1585908479554074e-07
       = 20.886226940436558

Since dE &lt; 10e-6, E = E2 = 20.886226940436558.

Step 4, get Jupiter's heliocentric coordinates.

    x = a * dcos(E - e) 
      = 5.202873221302303 * dcos(20.886226940436558 - 0.04837050733173315)
      = 4.8625576871122425

    y = a * sqrt(1 - e^2) * dsin(E)
      = 5.202873221302303 * (1 - 0.04837050733173315^2) * dsin(20.886226940436558)
      = 1.8505542193362774

    z = 0

Step 5, convert the heliocentric coordinates to ecliptic coordinates. This one is pretty big...

    x_ecl =    (dcos(Lp) * dcos(Lan) - dsin(Lp) * dsin(Lan) * dcos(I)) * x 
            + (-dsin(Lp) * dcos(Lan) - dcos(Lp) * dsin(Lan) * dcos(I)) * y

          =    (dcos(14.753708923445224) * dcos(100.49820801510504) - dsin(14.753708923445224)
                * dsin(100.49820801510504) * dcos(1.3041788626674733)) * 4.8625576871122425 
            + (-dsin(14.753708923445224) * dcos(100.49820801510504) - dcos(14.753708923445224) 
                * dsin(100.49820801510504) * dcos(1.3041788626674733)) * 1.8505542193362774

          = -0.4265341338713994 * 4.8625576871122425 + -0.9041945595412605 * 1.8505542193362774

          = -3.747307888732122 

    y_ecl =    (dcos(Lp) * dsin(Lan) + dsin(Lp) * dcos(Lan) * dcos(I)) * x 
            + (-dsin(Lp) * dsin(Lan) + dcos(Lp) * dcos(Lan) * dcos(I)) * y

          =    (dcos(14.753708923445224) * dsin(100.49820801510504) + dsin(14.753708923445224) 
                * dcos(100.49820801510504) * dcos(1.3041788626674733)) * 4.8625576871122425 
            + (-dsin(14.753708923445224) * dsin(100.49820801510504) + dcos(14.753708923445224) 
                * dcos(100.49820801510504) * dcos(1.3041788626674733)) * 1.8505542193362774

          = 0.904452893397832 * 4.8625576871122425 + -0.4265533563326196 * 1.8505542193362774

          = 3.6085942560891575
 
    z_ecl =   (dsin(Lp) * dsin(I)) * x 
            + (dcos(Lp) * dsin(I)) * y

          =   (dsin(14.753708923445224) * dsin(1.3041788626674733)) * 4.8625576871122425
            + (dcos(14.753708923445224) * dsin(1.3041788626674733)) * 1.8505542193362774

          = 0.005796228676034569 * 4.8625576871122425 + 0.02200983183404675 * 1.8505542193362774

          = 0.06891488347228944

So, as you can see, x_ecl turns out to be -3.75, while it should be approximately equal to y_ecl, +3.61. I suspect the problem is in step 3, where eccentricity is converted to degrees. I'm probably not following some implicit assumption that the author of the paper is making there. 

Or, x in step 4 could be either `a * (dcos(E) - e)` or `a * dcos(E - e)`.

I am working my way through [""Discrete Mathematics"" by A Chetwynd &amp; P Diggle](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Discrete-Mathematics-Modular-Amanda-Chetwynd/dp/0340610476), doing the exercises as I go. This is **not homework**, I am teaching myself the subject as well as I can from books. 

The solutions to exercises are not contained within the book, and I can't find them online, so I can't check if my answers are correct, and I'm really unsure of how to approach a couple of questions. I've had a go, but I'm not convinced by the answers.

I'm at the end of the section on conditional propositions, and I'm doing the exercises. Constructing truth tables is relatively easy, but converting statements into a series of logical symbols I find quite difficult. 

If I can, I'd like to check some of my answers here. 

----

**3.** Express [; p \iff q ;] using only the symbols *not*, *and*, *or*.

----

**3. Solution:**  [; (p \land q) \lor (\lnot p \land \lnot q ) ;]

----

**4.** Consider the statement 'Ann is older than Betty unless Betty is younger than Claire' in the following cases:

a)  Ann is 10, Betty is 11, Claire is 13.

b) Ann is 10, Betty is 9, Claire is 14.

c) Ann is 10, Betty is 6, Claire is 5.

d) Ann is 10, Betty is 11, Claire is 9.

Draw up a truth table for 'unless'.

----

**4. Solution:**

p = 'Ann is older than Betty'

q = 'Betty is younger than Claire'

r = 'Ann is older than Betty unless Betty is younger than Claire' 

p | q | r 
--|--|--
T | T | F
T | F | T
F | T | T
F | F | F 

Either the statement 'Ann is older than Betty' or the statement 'Betty is younger than Claire' needs to be false (but not both) in order for the whole statement 'Ann is older than Betty unless Betty is younger than Claire' to be true.  

----

**5.** Express each of the following propositions in logical symbols and decide in each case if the subsequent statement is a valid consequence of the proposition. 

**a)** *Proposition:* If I move house, then I will not be able to go on holiday in July.

*Statement:* Since I am going on holiday in July I will not move house.

----

**5. a) Solution:**

p = 'I move house'

q= 'I am not able to go on holiday in July'

Proposition: [; p \Rightarrow q ;]

Statement: [; \neg q \Rightarrow \neg p ;] - this does follow, as it is the contrapositive of the original proposition.

----

**5. b)** *Proposition:* Either the professor or the student committed the crime. If the professor did it, he would not have been able to give the lecture at 11.

*Statement:* Since the professor gave the lecture at 11, the student must have committed the crime.

----

**5. b) Solution:** 

p = 'The professor committed the crime'

q = 'The student committed the crime'

r = 'The professor gave the lecture at 11'

Proposition: [; r \Rightarrow (\neg p \land q) ;]

Statement: [; r \land q ;] - True. In order for the above statement to be true, q must be true and p must be false when r is true.

**5. c)** *Proposition:* If I get the job and work hard, then I will be promoted.

*Statement:* I was promoted, so I must have got the job.

p = 'I get the job'

q = 'I work hard'

r = 'I get promoted'

I've also read up on multivariable calc and it's extremely straight-forward (from Paul's calc III notes online). Can anyone recommend some reading that would be a challenge but at the same time not impossible? I'm really interested in physics and electrical engineering (my major) side of math as well.

1259709319.0,8,self.learnmath,aa1mt,Metric Spaces,chewxy,8,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/aa1mt/metric_spaces/,"I'm posting my first commentary on math, and the topic is metric spaces (that's because I'm most familiar with it, being an economist and all). The first post mentioned linear algebra and infinite dimensional spaces. I have no idea on how to write a lecture on linear algebra, and the closest thing I really know with regards to infinite dimensional spaces is metric spaces. Key words and concepts are bolded.

What's a metric space? To understand what a metric space is, we must first define it. A **metric** is a *measure of distance*. By that then, a **metric space** is a *set where the notion of distance defined amongst the points within the set*. Let's look at an example:

&gt; Take the real line, R. The real line is a line of *real numbers* - essentially, a set of real numbers. If you apply a suitable function (a function is a relationship between 2 sets), where both sets of which the function is applied to lies on R (i.e the function is between set A and set B; set A and set B are subsets of R; then R, together with the function, is a metric space.

&gt; If the above is too contrived to you, here's the tl;dr version:

&gt; * R is a set of real numbers.
&gt; * f() is a function that works on set A and set B
&gt; * set A and set B are subsets of R
&gt; * therefore R, together with f() is a metric space.

&gt; **Example**: absolute value function

&gt; For any two points, *x1* and *x2* in R, let the distance between them be denoted as *d(x1, x2)*.

&gt; *d(x1, x2)* = | *x1 - x2* |   &lt;---- This is a metric space

&gt; This can be further expanded upon with a Cartesian plane, R² (R to the dimension 2), and to every higher dimension of R. 

&gt; The ability to do that is trivial and left as an exercise to the reader

Now, after the example, you must be wondering why bother learning about metric spaces afterall? It's a Euclidean space and by the words of my old microeconomics lecurer, ""hardly interesting"". From metric spaces, the notion of openness, closeness, completeness, continuity and many more concepts. Also, metric spaces are the precursor you learn before diving into funner stuff like Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces.

Applications of metric spaces: Metric spaces are interesting, because in the field of theoretical microeconomics, they're verily often used to denote preferences (for example: Let X be the preference set of L, X is a subset of R^(whatever amount of choices they have). Let it be closed blablabla).

It has a lot of implications in theory (topology mainly). I'm not so sure of application of metric spaces in real life.

It has selected solutions to problems in the back, and I think I've discovered a mistake.  I was hoping someone could check my reasoning/math, in case I'm actually misunderstanding something.

The Problem (37 from Section 2.4):

&gt; Suppose a ""circle graph"" has 5 nodes connected (in both directions) by edges around a circle.  What is its adjacency matrix?  What are A^2 and A^3 and the diameter of this graph?

From the textbook (emphasis not added):

&gt; When A^k has ***no zeros***, that number k is the ***diameter*** of the graph - the number of edges needed to connect the most distant pair of nodes.

**My answer:**

A = [0 1 0 0 1; 1 0 1 0 0; 0 1 0 1 0; 0 0 1 0 1; 1 0 0 1 0]

A^2 =  [2 0 1 1 0; 0 2 0 1 1; 1 0 2 0 1; 1 1 0 2 0; 0 1 1 0 2];

A^3 = [0 3 1 1 3; 3 0 3 1 1; 1 3 0 3 1; 1 1 3 0 3; 3 1 1 3 0];

The first A^k matrix with no zeros is A^4.  However if you draw the graph, you'll easily discover that the diameter of the graph should be 2.  It only takes a maximum of two vertices to connect one arbitrary node of the graph to any other arbitrary node on the graph.

**The book's answer:**

The adjacency matrix and subsequent powers all agree (I mean, I could just check that in Matlab anyway).  But the solution says that the diameter of the graph is 3 because A^3 + A^2 has no zeros.

My take is that:

1.  The definition of diameter is obviously wrong.  It should be the k for which the sum I + A^1 + ... + A^k has no zeros.  
2.  The answer is also wrong, since A + A^2 has no zeros.

I obviously set the graph up correctly, since the adjacency matrices match.  Did I miss something about diameter that someone can explain to me?  I can't find any corrections online.

I was basically a bio major in college though (neuroscience), so I'm trying to beef up my math/engineering background over the summer. I'm looking at Fourier analysis now, and I get the basics of it, but I just had one quick question about the difference between using trig functions or complex exponentials in Fourier analysis.

(For simplicity's sake, I'll assume we're talking about functions with period [;2\pi;])

The first video I watched on Fourier analysis (PatrickJMT), talked about representing periodic functions as a linear combination of the set of functions:

`[; \{ 1, cos(x), cos(2x),...,sin(x),sin(2x),... \} ;] `

where all the trig coefficients are positive integers. The author then showed that this set of functions is orthogonal on the interval [; \[-\pi,\pi];] (and more generally you can show it's also orthogonal on any interval with a length that's a multiple of [;2\pi;]).

Since complex exponentials essentially encompass the trig functions, I wasn't surprised to see that we can also use functions of the form `[;e^{i n x};]` instead:

`[; f(x) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} a_{n} e^{i n x} ;]`

However, it doesn't seem like this set of functions is orthogonal on any non-zero interval. For example, if we take `[;e^{ix};]` and `[;e^{-ix};]`, then their inner product will be non-zero on any non-zero interval. We could fix this by only using [;n \in \mathbb{N};] but we kinda need the negative coefficients so that cos(nx) and sin(nx)  ""drop out"" of the complex representation.

So what's the deal? Do we not care about the orthogonal requirement when using complex exponentials as the basis? Or is there a different definition of an inner product for complex numbers that I'm missing?

&gt;Given ax+by=k, cx+dy=l, and ex+fy=m, if k=l=m=0, show that the system must be consistent. What can be said about the point of intersection of the three lines if the system has exactly one solution?  

* My answer: If these intersect at a single point, solving all of these equations for y makes it clear that they will all intersect at the origin, with the only difference between the lines being their slopes. But as I'll probably say a couple of times here, this seems too simple to be right.

&gt;Consider the equations x+y+2z=a, x+z=b, and 2x+y+3z=c. Show that in order for this system to be consistent, a, b, and c must satisfy c=a+b.  

* My answer: Is is really just as easy as adding a to b and showing that the sum equals c? That doesn't quite seem right.

&gt;Prove: If the linear equations x+jy=c and x+ky=d have the same solution set, then their equations must be identical.  

* My answer: If they have the same solution, then they must be equal at some point (or always), so x+jy=x+ky=c=d. From there, you can use simple manipulations to show j=k, and thus that the equations are identical. Again, this seems too simple.

I've included a link to my written work [here](http://i.imgur.com/5azcafd.jpg).

I have found the first five terms as the problem states and have decided that this sequence converges. I've taken the limit and after struggling with figuring out L'hopital's rule again, my limit as n approaches infinity appears to be 2. However, my book says the answer is e^2 .  I feel like I might be missing something important, but I've gone through my book and calc I notes and can't seem to figure out what I'm missing? The solution manual skips steps and I'm not sure where 'e' is coming from .... 

My instructor went over this problem and used e= lim (1+(1/n))^n as n-&gt; infinity to solve the problem, however, I didn't recall seeing that theorem before. I understand how he solved that, but I feel that taking the ln of both sides is a little bit more intuitive for me, but I can't figure out how to finish the problem...

there is a quantity x, it is 'multiplied' by a quantity y,

Maybe each number is called a dimension, each quantity is a scalar, because a quantity is basically just a mark on a scale of measurement. But then you have some measurements related to other measurements and the relations are algebraic, so I'm wondering how algebra is fully understood and if it is expressing something not man-made, such as the random permutations of scalars performing acts of algebraic modification upon each other.

is it possible there are more operations of permutation that are not algebraic? is algebra a subset, or a member of a larger set of permutations?

Over my winter break, I've decided that I want to research a bit into ellipsoids. Ever since a question popped up on an assignment in calculus, I've had a bit of an obsession with how to find the factors of an ellipsoid in R^(3), so that a surface described in the form:

&gt;ax^2 +by^2 +cz^2 +dxy +exz +fyz = r^2

Can be described by some functions g, h, and j:

&gt;g^(2)(x,y,z) +h^(2)(x,y,z) +j^(2)(x,y,z) = r^2

So far, I haven't found a way to factor ellipsoids with complicated or large coefficients, but I did notice something strange:

When I was playing around with ellipses in R^2, I realized that an ellipse of the form:

&gt;g^(2)(x,y) +h^(2)(x,y) = r^2

Falls between the lines:
&gt;g(x,y) = r

&gt;g(x,y) = -r

&gt;h(x,y) = r

&gt;h(x,y) = -r

And that these lines are tangential to the ellipse. Upon expanding on the idea, I realized that any non-periodic functions g(x,y) and h(x,y) in R^2 that satisfy the first equation fall between those lines. I then realized that if there was a mapping that mapped the object described by the first equation above to the unit circle, that the lines would merely form a square around the unit circle.

What have I stumbled across with my ellipse realization? Is there an algorithm for factoring ellipsoids in R^(3)? How could I extend my study of functions in these form?

In pursuit of understanding, I have been trying to develop an intuition for the concepts and theorems my textbook has been developing. Something that helped me to learn and understand the material in my first Analysis class was that I was able to associate the topological concepts we used there with a visual intuition about the real number line (with the ""regular"" topology) - epsilon-neighborhoods became circles, open neighborhoods circles in circles, ""limit"" points and boundaries of sets little lines, and so on - and these visualizations helped me to focus on the underlying concepts whether reading, writing or remembering proofs. However, when studying topology, though I find that I can develop comfort with the language used by abstract definitions and theorems (I can read a line and explain why it is true down to definitions), they do not click until I have associated them with one of the example topologies introduced in the opening chapter - regular topology on R, the discrete topology, the finite closed topology, the countable closed topology. I have visual mnemonics that seem to work okay for those, but I was wondering if there existed out in the mathematical literature a more developed mechanism of visual mnemonics which I could learn from and use as an aid in my studying, as clearly using any of the example spaces limits my understanding to only certain cases of the theorem.

I'm having a little trouble understanding what certain types of integrals mean. I'm currently using complex variables but I had the same issue in real variable calculus as well.

Basically here is where I am at. I understand that in real variable calculus when you integrate a function you are finding out the area under the curve. I understand how and why this works (I think). Using complex variables I extend this to thinking that when you integrate a function you are finding some 4-dimensional equivalent of area. 

Where I get lost is when we integrate along an arc or contour(not for arc length). So my question is when I integrate along a contour what am I finding out? Sometimes it seems we are asked to integrate arbitrary functions along a curve. What does this value represent in both real and complex variable calculus.

I'm a little fuzzy on the logic behind these proofs. Let me just talk about single-variable for a moment. 

* I understand how it looks, graphically, with a certain range around L (epsilon) and a certain range around x (delta). 
* I understand the language of it, i.e., if the limit of f(a)=L, then for any epsilon you choose, there ought to be a delta I can choose such that as long as you stay within delta units of a, the result will always be within epsilon units of L.
* I also understand that this means that one needs to choose a delta that is a function of epsilon, so that it will work generically (i.e., delta = 0.1 might work for a single epsilon, but not for every epsilon).
* I am usually pretty good at finding this δ function. I just manipulate |f(x) - L| &lt; ε until the left side of the inequality is identical to |x-a|.

I'm a bit foggy on a couple of things, though. First, I'm not quite sure what to when L is something other than zero. It seems difficult to remove the -L from inside an absolute value, because then you get something like this, which seems harder to deal with:

L-ε &lt; |f(x)| &lt; L+ε

Second, I'm just generally slow with the algebra of inequalities. I can usually get the answer, even with the multi-variable stuff, but it takes a while.



Third, I just often times have trouble taking my answer, and wording it as an actual proof. Sometimes it's difficult for me to see how two inequalities that are separate, except connected by an ""if...then"" (i.e., if ineq1 then ineq2) can be arranged into a proof, or how modifying one inequality affects the other. With trivial ones like ""if 0 &lt; x &lt; δ then |x| &lt; ε"", it's easy to see that δ must be less-than, or equal to, ε (just thinking of a number line).

Of the 11 exams we had, I passed all but one with ease - yeah, you guessed it, I failed Math by 3% 

I've had a very strange relationship with Math throughout my life. Up until the age of 15 or 16, I was one of the best at the subject in my school. A's were a regularity and I genuinely enjoyed the subject (when it was going well). But during my last few years of High school, things started to go badly wrong - first of all, one of the best Math teachers I have ever experienced retired, and was replaced with possibly the worst maths teacher on the planet. Slowly but surely, my grades started to slip. Now, although I was concerned, I initially blamed it on the fact that the teacher could not teach. So I went to tutorials - but then I realised, that even though the tutorials improved my grades, I wasn't able to get back up to the level I was once at. This depressed me a lot, because ever since I had started High school I'd known I wanted to be an Engineer. In the end, I put I enough work in to just about get the required grade in my Finals to get into my desired engineering course.

Now, I've always been able to understand mathematical concepts if explained correctly and clearly to me - mathematical comprehension has rarely been an issue with me if I concentrate enough &amp; have good material to work off. What my problem is, I often have immense difficulty seeing when the concepts I have learned need to be applied. That's the reason I failed the 1st year Calculus in Engineering. Even though I'd done quite well in the two term exams, when I went into the final exam my brain just seized up and could not recognise when formulas and conepts I knew needed to be applied. To put it plainly - I went blank. And that wasn't the first time it had happened in a math exam.

I'm now a few days away from the repeat exam that will decide if I get to stay in college this year. I've been studying hard for the past month and made quite a few sacrifices to have the time to study. Looking back on the summer paper, I can now do about 85% of the questions with ease. Yet I couldn't do that during the exam even though I knew the ways of solving them. I fear it may happen again with the repeat :(

First, my excuses. Requests for learning materials have already been here many times, but since this seems somewhat specific case, I'm asking again. Also, I'm not native English speaker.

I'm in my early thirties (wow, I never thought I'd say that), and I still have a love/hate relationship with math. I'm trying to see here if and how I can learn it properly. While in school, I always caught it quickly, but have never developed comprehensive/deep understanding. I do have bachelor's degree in computer engineering, but besides little cramming for exams, I never really learnt anything, so most of math didn't stick. Anyway, too many times I've caught myself using approximations and spreadsheets for solving problems, and while it is fun, it is not proper way, so like it or not, I see I need math, so I should learn it.

Basically it seems I like math, but most of the time, I'm not too comfortable with the way it's presented. Maybe this is just my rationalisation and excuse, I'm here to find this out. While I have no explicit need for, I really like and it helps me a lot to know how something is working ""underneath"" before I start using it. This holds for math too, maybe even more than anything else, and unfortunately for most of my experience with math I was taught how and almost never why. My viewpoint on learning may be naive, but it seems I understand things best that way.

I would like to relearn first two years of college math properly and then see if and where I want to go further. For now I picked up Stroud's Engineering Mathematics, went trough first chapter and skimmed the rest, and while it is a great book it seems to present information in a traditional way.

For example, commutativity and associativity are introduced but there is no explanation why do they work. I know that you who know math will probably laugh your socks off, addition is simple, you just throw things on a pile, but multiplication didn't seem so trivial. I explained it to myself as constructing a rectangle in as many dimensions as there are operands, and as it doesn't matter which way it is constructed, rectangle is always the same (properly rotated). Similarly, to describe what kind of approach I would like, I got to (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 . Never before it crossed my mind that you can put these variables in a table, and more, that you can separate square into adequately sized rectangles. To me, this was beautiful glimpse into how combinatorics, geometry and algebra are interconnected at some deeper level, but still can't stop thinking that this should have been clear to me 15 years ago. I also tried understanding Bridge of asses and Pythagoras's theorem from Euclid's Elements (Byrne's edition), and it seems I like approach there, it doesn't explicitly state things, but proofs (at least these two) are constructed so that they light up enough brain cells, although I would prefer explicit explanations. And final example, maybe the best, algebraic proofs that 0.999... = 1, they show but they don't explain. I don't understand analytic proofs, but they are probably similar to how I explained this one to myself: 9/10 of rectangle is filled and 1/10 is filled recursively, so rectangle is filled.

Is it possible that approach I'm searching for doesn't make sense, and while math inclined get deeper understanding implicitly, the rest of us should be satisfied just with surface knowledge, e.g. symbol manipulation? And is it that just now I seem to get glimpses of what I should have got first time I was taught math?

If there is still hope for me, as I'm afraid that wrong approach will scare me away again, is there any literature which approaches math from scratch in way that explains and builds deeper understanding, in a way I seem to get? I just don't seem to be able to find a book that hits the sweet spot, either it's to wordy and doesn't explain deep enough, or it is way too cryptic. What would you recommend?

tl;dr: Having love/hate relationship with math, never learned a lot of it and forgot almost everything. Would like to (re)learn it from scratch. This time I'd like approach that primarily shows why, not only how.

I'm being totally serious.  I personally used to love science when I was younger (23 now) and I still do but back then I could not understand certain concepts and teachers would basically shrug and keep going with the class for what I later learned was to save their jobs. I was able to *just get by* with a lot of extra work up until middle school then in high school it was obvious I have no idea what is going on so I dropped out. 

It was very disappointing seeing my teachers faces as they would slide me my Fs. I remember one teacher would give me my paper last (the class would always brag and go wild trading results about who has the higher grade like comparing Christmas presents) and he would always give me a grim look and quickly slide me mines. It became a routine and after a while kids would want to see mines and would laugh.. after a while he told us NOT to show others our papers. He claimed it was because they got too wild and noisy but I have a feeling that was just for my sake. Their laughs never upset me it was just the look the teachers gave me that did. Things like this continued throughout my grade school. Teachers would implement timers for who could solve problems the quickest, throw pizza/popcorn and movie parties for those able to do their entire times tables through 9 in x amount of time. The rest of us would struggle with the math forced to smell the popcorn down the hall for the rest of the day. In high school I had a teacher that would already have the stuff on the board and we had to grab the paper at the front of the class and was expected just ""do the math"" I guess. I think nearly *everyone* failed that class though.

I did get my GED and boy that was a mathematical challenge. It was like forcing someone with a life long phobia to overcome it over night. My GED teachers were caring and considerate but mentally, my brain checked out years/a decade ago. I felt like those people on game shows that eat nasty things like squid or roaches or whatever for the prize at the end. I did it but immediately checked out right after I passed.

Anyway now I'm in college about to take some placement testing to see where I end up. I'm guessing basic arithmetic but I still have this phobia. I have horrible anxiety, like when you're a kid wondering if your parents will come home ok anxiety. I know it is all in my head and math might not be that bad but I am 23 and I honestly have no (good) memory of what a ""math class"" was even like so I do not know what to expect. In college I'm on my own anyway and I honestly do not know if I can go through the failure again.

For my career I love astronomy and physics and I was told ironically the rest of my life would be nothing but math/physics. Right now, my biggest fear is failing these classes. I have been taught so many ways to do math with ""shortcuts"" and different teachers allowing this, some not, some wanting work shown, some don't care, some let us use calculators, some don't want us counting on our hands, some we need to remember formulas, some have them on the board.. for a subject that is supposed to be ""straight forward"" I've experienced a lot of corruptness in my education.

That's my story sorry if it is too long my intention is to maybe find others like me that overcame math. I do like the power of math and what can be done with it but even using Khan-academy I mess up and it's like great another failure. I could be successful if I had a **SET OF RULES, that NEVER CHANGED** really. I just can not continue with these changes. Is there a way to learn math like this or not? 

 I am not embarrassed anymore. I am just frustrated and **sick of failing**. All of the methods I am and have learned do not seem to work and sometimes just mix.

Let phi : G -&gt; H be a homomorphism between two groups.

The kernel of phi is

ker phi = {g element of G | phi(g) = eH}

My understanding of this definition is that the kernel consists of the elements of G that, after going through the function/homomorphism, give the identity of the codomain. I'm pretty sure this is what the book is telling me, but please correct me if I am wrong.

Moving on, the example from my textbook is what confuses me. Here it is:

Say phi is a homomorphism from Z to Z, where phi(k) = 2k. The kernel of phi is {k | 2k = 0, k element of Z} = {0}.

What confuses me is:
Why isn't the kernel {k | 2k = 1, k element of Z}? Since 1 is the identity of Z if used when Z is under multiplication. The question never states that they are using Z additively (which would obviously make the identity element = 0)

In a nutshell: Which identity of the codomain am I looking for, the codomain under addition (in the example, 0) or under multiplcation (in the example, 1).

I know that phi is the distance from the z axis and ranges from 0&lt;Φ&lt;π.  I understand that ρ is the radius.

I am generally good at solving for theta and ρ, but when it comes to phi I have trouble. Anyone know any good tips for understanding?  Part of this comes from my inability to see/produce a graph.  

Example:
F(x,y,z)=sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 ); x^2 + y^2 + z^2 ≤ 2z

Solving for the given equation, I easily get that 0&lt;ρ&lt;2cosΦ .  I can easily see that it is a full circle, so I know that 0&lt;Θ&lt;2π.  Now the answer for Φ is 0&lt;Φ&lt;π/2.  How does this work??  Why would it not be 0&lt;Φ&lt;π?

Another example:
f(x,y,z)=ρ; x^2 + y^2 + z^2 ≤ 4, z≤ 1, 0≤ x

Here I can easily solve the equation and get 0&lt;ρ&lt;2.  Also, given the fact that z≤ 1, I can use this, change to spherical coordinates, plug in ρ, and solve for Φ = π/3.  This is all easy for me.  The hard part is this:

1319940579.0,6,self.learnmath,ltqxz,The set of all even numbers is the same size as the set of natural numbers? (and a mapping question),Marcel_Ledbetter,6,0,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/ltqxz/the_set_of_all_even_numbers_is_the_same_size_as/,"I'm reading an [old K5 post on misconceptions about infinity](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/6/3/95744/71866), and keep stumbling across these two examples. What I don't get is what is the purpose of the mappings he does here? For instance, in the first example, set E is the set of all even natural numbers in N. He then proceeds to prove that E is the same size as N using 1-1 correspondence. But the only way he can do so is by mapping elements in N so they become elements of E. This seems like cheating, redefining E and/or N after the fact to fit his claim. I can grasp the 1-1 cardinality idea meaning the sets are equal in size, and I'm willing to make the logical leap that says the set of even numbers is the same cardinality as the set of all numbers if I can see it, but I don't see it from these examples.

&gt; Take the set of all natural numbers, N, and throw away the odd numbers. Call the result E, the set of even numbers. Question: how many elements does E have? Surely E must only have half the number of elements as N, since we threw away the other half? Not really. Consider this correspondence: for every element x in N, we map it to x*2. Since x*2 is even, x*2 is an element of E. Every number in N is mapped to exactly one element in E, and every element in E has exactly one number in N mapped to it. The fingers match! This means that E and N in fact have the same size. 

No, every element in N wasn't mapped to an element in E and E was half the size of N. But to make the proof he redefined N to be something different than it was before he created E.

Is he creating an implicit third set that isn't identified when he does the mappings? I'm rather lost on the point of the mappings other than to ""cheat.""

In the second example, he seems to perform the mappings arbitarily, mapping positive numbers to odd numbers and negative numbers to even numbers, which seems like he is manipulating the data to reach the conclusion he wants. ""And when you draw the magic blue pony it all evens out!"" ಠ_ಠ

&gt; Well, consider the set of integers, Z. For every integer z in Z, if z is positive, we map it to (z\*2)+1, which is a positive odd number. If z is negative, we map it to -z\*2, which is a positive even number. And if z is 0, it stays 0. Note that every odd number is covered, and so is every even number, including 0. Miracle! Did you see what just happened? What looked like two ""infinite endpoints"" in Z has collapsed into a single endpoint, and we are back to N, the set of natural numbers, yet again!

I'm a freshman who started attending University 4 weeks ago. I'm quite rusty on math, since I have been working for the past 2-3 years before starting this school. 

I love my major, and I have choosen it because I'm really interested in it. The one thing is that it's quite heavy on math (it's an engineering major), but I have chosen it also because of this, but let me explain this last point.

I never was that kid that got all the good marks in math without doing anything. To be honest, I rather was the kid that never got the good marks beacuse I was scared of math and scared of learning it, because it was too difficult for me. I always had my difficulties with math. Nonetheless, I also had the one or other success story in math, like the one time I flunked a calculus test. Doesn't sound so successful, I know, but I had a second try which I had to pass at all costs. Before the second try, I took the time to go through the whole material for that course and guess what, I aced the test on a second try. Yes, it was a second try, but the test was a completely different one. Nonetheless, it felt really good, because I worked really hard for that mark. This happened in the last year of my previous school. After that I went to work in the industry for the past 2-3 years.

I don't know what happened in the past few years, but I have changed my mind completely in regard to math. I would love to get all the complicated math, because let's be honest, math is a powerful toolset. I'm now way more open to math, and I know that it takes a lot of work to 'get' math, and to be good in it. 

As already mentioned, I have choosen this major also because it's quite heavy on math. My thinking behind this was that once I started university, I had no other option then to sit down an learn all the complicated math, no matter what.

But right now I don't know if it's just too much for me, and if it's impossible to 'get' math for somebody like me.

I'm currently very motivated to learn math, as long as I become better in it. **My very problem right now** is that every time I encounter a math problem marked as simple (some problems are marked as simple on the problems sheet) of which I don't know the solution or which I can't approach correctly, or I see people around me having way less problems getting a math topic or solving a problem I feel really demotivated. I feel like it's just too hard for me and I should just stop here and call it a day. But somehow I always can hear a voice in the back of my head out of nowhere that says I can make it, that says if I really work hard, I can do it. But sometimes I feel it takes too much effort for me to get something rather simple in University.

Right now I have a problem understanding a combinatorics problem.

I love science, I would love to complete this BSc, but currently I'm really on a roller coaster of emotions, and most of the times I'm just feeling sad because of all of this.

Are there other people that feel like this? Are there any people that were in the same position as mine, but it finally clicked?

If you do, let me know and I can explain further.

I have this graphable equation:

x - 0.125sin(2πx) = y

However, the problem is that I need to solve for x, not y. y is a value that I will know for certain (and, if it helps, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.0). Could you guys please help me turn this into an equation easily solvable for x? I basically need to combine the two x values on the left side, but I am struggling to do so. Thanks, /r/learnmath!

EDIT (for further info on the problem I'm trying to solve): Basically, I'm using this as a formula to translate the visualization of a smaller circle having an Area that is a certain percentage of a larger circle. Part of an application I'm writing is using a chart that is one circle nested within another, right in the center. If the inner circle SHOULD have 50% of the area of the outer circle, I want it to appear that way to the human brain at first glance. Unfortunately, [placing a circle that is 1/2 the size of another circle inside that larger circle makes it actually look about 70% of the size to our brains](http://i.imgur.com/KLQiV.gif). 

Interestingly enough, however, if you put a circle within another circle and that smaller circle has half the DIAMETER of the larger circle, our brains interpret that circle as being half the size. I took a sampling of size differences between the two circles (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%) and found that the relationship between a smaller circle having a diameter between 0-100% of the larger circle and the way our brains interpret the areas is the equation I listed above. The problem is that in the equation, x represents the diameter, which is the value I'm trying to solve for (I already have the percent, which is y).

Quite embarrassing to be stuck on, but here I am.. 

I can get the correct answer by just following the steps, but I don't under stand *why* a certain step is performed the way it is. 

For example:

    The following line passes through point (4,4):
    
    y=5/3x+b
    
    What is the value of the y-intercept b?

So, substituting gives: 

    4=5/3⋅4+b 

Simplifying: 

    4=20/3+b

Now here is where I am not understanding what steps are taken. They show the following as the next step:

    b=4−20/3

Why was the 4 placed *before* the 20/3 instead of after? To get it from the left side to the right aren't you subtracting both sides by 4..? This appears to be *positive* 4 *minus* 20/3, which gives a completely different answer than 20/3-4.

As I see it, this is how the problem is performed: 

    4=5/3⋅4+b 
    
    4=20/3+b
    
    -b+4=20/3
    
    -b=20/3-4
    
    -b=20/3-12/3
    
    -b=8/3
    
    b= -8/3

So we end up with the same answer. I just want to understand why their way works. 

Hopefully that makes sense.

edit) Thank you guys for the responses. Khanacademy is not an opstion. I don't have an enough alotted bandwidth a month to go thru it. I guess the best way is to get hold of text books of high school and college tho. I like to brush up my algebra, calculus, geometry and probability. I am hoping to find books that are not too straight-laced but covers the mid to high level. I didn't magor in maths at college it was just a part of the general education. So my maths basically stopped after highscool, even that are very vauge now.
Thank you for mentioning some books. Will check them on Amazon now. I just found out there are way too many of Dummies in maths. Do you know any book, apart from brushing up my maths, that is practical and apply to everyday life?",,False,self,t5_2rdi4,True,,,True,t3_hw697,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/hw697/what_are_the_best_books_to_study_maths/,

Now, how is it possible to work out maximum speed? One thought I had to explain my confusion is this.

~~Because the magnitude of acceleration isn't stated, suppose that the acceleration of the car is large, making the maximum speed large. This must mean the deceleration will be large too. Just like if the acceleration is low, max speed will be low, the deceleration will be low too.~~
I've realised that the distance covered doesn't let this happen.

v ends up being,

Non-negativity and μ{} = 0 is really easy so the point of the exercise must be to prove σ-additivity. My problem is when I try to interchange inf and the summation in  

inf (Σ[ μ_1(E_n ∩ F) + μ_2(E_n \ F) ] )  

(E_n an arbitrary sequence in Σ, the sum runs over the naturals and the infimum is taken over all F in Σ)

Μy attempt was to prove ≤ and ≥ seperately. One of them is trivial by taking infima over F of both sides of Σ[ μ_1(E_n ∩ F) + μ_2(E_n \ F) ] ≥ Σ μE_n. How do I proceed with the other?

1375477984.0,4,self.learnmath,1jl87s,I need some guidance on how to fit an equation into a Google Docs cell [Calc 2(?)],LordComa,6,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1jl87s/i_need_some_guidance_on_how_to_fit_an_equation/,"Hi; I'm developing a character sheet for a small tabletop game system I've been working on. I'm using Google Docs so my friends can access it easily.

My problem is this: A character's stat progression becomes more difficult the higher the stat's current value. Everyone starts with a 7 in his or her stat (Intelligence, Strength, etc) and uses a pool of points to increase it. After there are 10 points in a stat, it costs 2 points from the pool to increase. After 15, it costs 3, and so on.

What I've figured would be easiest way for both  the user and the spreadsheet to figure out how many stats someone has is to add to the appropriate ""Stat points spent"" cell, and have Docs change the corresponding Stat Value cell.

How to achieve this with a basic formula is where I'm stuck. The basic progression from 1 point onward would of course be 

1 1

2 2

3 3

4 3.5

5 4

6 4.5

7 5

8 5.5

9 6

10 6.5

11 7

12 7.5

13 8

14 8.33

15 8.67

16 9

Where the left column is the number of points spend and the right column is the number of stats earned. To avoid mess and confusion I'd use the FLOOR or TRUNC functions to leave only integers behind. What I need is a general formula to apply to the cell so that I don't have a huge list of IF-THEN's. What I'd like even more would be to be told a much simpler way to do it, since I'm not very proficient with either Docs or math :X

Calculate the volume of the solid of revolution that occurs. 

I tried doing it by deriving an expression for the area between the parabola and the line, and then applying the method for calculating the volume of a solid of revolution on that. Like this.

First I took the points of intersection of the parabola and the line:

y = -x^2 + 2  
y = 1  
-x^2 + 2 = 1  
-x^2 = -1  
x=+-1  

I integrated the expression pi(-x^2 + 1)^2 (The expression for the parabola minus the line squared) with -1 and 1 as the limits of integration. Since it's an even function, I applied the appropriate rule and instead took two times the integral from 0 to 1 of it. This gave me:

I can't sleep until I have figured out the right way to calculate this. I haven't used much math since I graduated school 11 years ago so I'm a bit rusty on logarithms and exponents.

There was a [question in another subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1j0nua/so_i_take_a_track_in_129_bpmemajor_and_change_it/) about what key a 129 BPM (Beats per minute) song in E major would be if we changed its tempo to 140 BPM.

The tempo is increased by a factor of (140/129) 1.09, or about 9%. If the tempo is increased by 100%, the key will go up 12 semi notes. If the tempo is decreased by 50%, the key will go down 12 semi notes.

In our western musical scale, we start with the tone A4 at 440 Hz and tune each half tone up by a factor of 2^(n/12) or *the twelfth root of 2* where *n* is the number of semi notes.

     A4: 440 Hz
    A#4: 440 Hz * 2^(1/12) OR 440 Hz * (1.059)
     B4: 440 Hz * 2^(2/12) OR 440 Hz * (1.059 * 1.059)
     C5: 440 Hz * 2^(3/12) OR 440 Hz * (1.059 * 1.059 * 1.059)
    ...

Initially, I thought we could calculate it this way (8% of 12) (the decimals are rounded) but that turned out to be incorrect:

    140    / 129 ≈  1.09
      1.09 *  12 = 13.08
     13.08 -  12 =  1.08

to say that the key would be raised by about 1.08 semi notes or 108 cents (1.08 * 100, one octave or 12 semi notes are 1200 cents), but the answer is actually 1.42 semi notes or 142 cents. I suspect that we have to use some logarithmic or exponential calculations involving the twelfth root of 2 here, due to how the musical scale and tones work, but that kind of calculation is beyond my scope of knowledge.

Can anyone shed some light on how this is calculated? The following equations are true:

    x(1.00) = x
    x(2.00) = x * 2^( 12/12)
    x(0.50) = x * 2^(-12/12)

This gives us the following equations (I think 1.42 is rounded to 2 decimals) where we need to find *y*:

      x(140/129) = x * 2^(y/12) ≈ 1.42
    ≈ x(   1.09) = x * 2^(y/12) ≈ 1.42

First I'd like to state that I am not studying math at college level so I might not be terming things right or presenting things correct, but fortunately there is an article that do make things clearer.

Ok, so everything is comprehensible and good, until page 6. It's about dice rolls when there are two attackers, Y(1) and Y(2), and two defenders Z(1) and Z(2). They are sorted, so Y(1) is greater or equal to Y(2), same goes for Z(1) and Z(2).

We are looking at finding the probability for when the defender loses both his units, so Y(1) &gt; Z(1) and Y(2) &gt; Z(2). Further there are 4 ways this can be done:

* Y(1) = Y(2) and Z(1) = Z(2)
* Y(1) = Y(2) and Z(1) &gt; Z(2)
* Y(1) &gt; Y(2) and Z(1) = Z(2)
* Y(1) &gt; Y(2) and Z(1) &gt; Z(2)

First it says there are 15 ways when the following condition is met: Y(1) = Y(2) and Z(1) = Z(2), which I agree to, because they are defined in the article as:

* (6, 6) beats (5, 5), (4, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1)
* (5, 5) beats (4, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1)
* (4, 4) beats (3, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1)
* (3, 3) beats (2, 2), (1, 1)
* (2, 2) beats (1, 1)

Next it says that there are 20 ways using the next condition (Y(1) = Y(2) and Z(1) &gt; Z(2)), 20 for the third and 50 for the fourth, here is where I'm having trouble. I can only find 10 when I look for the second third and fourth:

Second

While this is fine for a computer simulation, it would be very difficult for a real-world application.  

What I'm trying to determine is if anyone ever made a formula or theorem describing the relationship between the 2 polygons (in this case dodecagons) which form a ring where instead of each inner face being simply projected to a parallel outer face each outer face is shifted to form what would have been their adjacent face. - Giving the illusion of an iris. 

I know that each blade's internal angles must add up to 360 degrees but I was hoping there was some method of ensuring the most simplistic cut possible as I will be using 4 different materials (3 blades of each). 

Are these a variation of polynomial rings and if so what does that mean?

I graduated from HS in 2007 and went straight to college. When I took my math placement test I scored really low, 42 IIRC. I dropped out after one semester, and haven't taken classes since. This summer I decided to start going back to school in the fall. Because I dropped out I was required to meet with a counselor to register for classes. I was told because of my low placement score I would have to re-take the test since it was so low the first time and I've been gone for so long. The good news is I don't technically have a deadline. I'm retaking the classes I dropped this semester and there's other classes I can take until I'm ready to do my math test again. I do however agree with her that I should try and take it sooner then later and would like to try and take it sometime this fall. 

My problem is I have no idea where to start. I never really did good in math. 7th grade I had a really bad teacher and just barely passed that class. I thought I could get caught up in 8th grade but it didn't happen. We spent all of a week reviewing what we did the previous year then moved on. Being an idiot teenager I never went and got help. HS was more of the same, barely maintaining a d+/c- average. I don't remember the names of the classes I took, but I'm positive i stopped junior year in some sort of algebra class. 

The counselor gave me some info on what would be on the test and I've spent the past few days going around places trying to figure out what I definitely know and don't. For example I tried looking through the algebra section on KA and while I recognize some of the terms, I tried looking at some of the problems there and on a few other sites and I don't have a clue on how to do anything. 

I'm getting to the point where I'm starting to feel frustrated and like a complete idiot. I'm really liking KA and would like to start there.

I have 2-3 semesters left before I recieve my B.S. in computer science. I've been working on the two required calculus semesters this summer, and I'm doing fairly well (got a B in calc 1, and I'm surviving calc 2). The CS program at my school requires you to also pick a concentration, and I'm doing stats.

I'm also seriously considering adding a math minor to my degree, because my calculus courses and a stats course I'm taking in the fall will cover half of the credit requirements (also because I've found that math is actually kind of fun if you know what you're doing and have the right mindset).

So I spoke to an instructor/advisor in the math and stats department and she highly recommended I take either linear algebra or multivariable calculus (at least one of the two is required for the math minor). If I take linear algebra, I can take linear programming. If I take multivariable calculus, I can take differential equations. I've had the impression that calculus' biggest applications are in physics and engineering, which don't particularly interest me as much as programming does, but she seemed to really be pushing the diff. equations course which requires me to take multivariable calc first.

Taking either pair of classes will leave me with one more course required to complete the minor; There are a bunch of options but I'm thinking of either number theory, numerical algorithms, or combinatorics. Neither linear algebra nor calc 3 is a prerequisite for any of these so I can take one of them no matter what.

**TL;DR: CS/stats undergrad considering adding a math minor, trying to select three math courses that would be most useful to my field.**

**EDIT: For everyone saying discrete math, I forgot to mention that I've already taken that one as it's a prereq for some of the core sophomore-level classes in my school's CS program.

A clock has its minute and hour hands at 12. After they begin moving, how long it takes for the minute hand to be over the hour hand again?

My solution, using m as time passed in minutes:

Hour hand angle = 0.5 * m

Minute hand angle = 6 * m

Put one equal the other, profit! Well, not really. What I noticed is that it goes above 360º, and I didn't figure out how to make it not without complicating it a lot.

Maybe this, with h as hours passed? 

Minute hand angle = 6 * m - 360 * h

Doesn't work.

The solution I found on the web, using h as hours and m as minutes:

Hour hand angle = 0.5 * (60 * h + m)

Minute hand angle = 6 * m

Put one equal the other, and you can solve for the minutes without trouble.

I understand this is a simple problem, but I really want to understand if there's a way to adjust ""my"" solution. I thought about using just one variable for simplicity, don't know if it's possible.

However, for the set of all subsets N (I'll call it P), with 2^n elements, the cardinal number is N1, so N1=2^N0.

However, I can easily imagine ordering P in a systematic way as {{O},{1},{2},{1,2},{3},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}, etc.}, just copying the elements already in the set and adding the next natural number to each one. It stands to reason that just being able to order the elements of a set is not enough, so I'm missing something about the original proof for the rationals. Is it because the subsets of N listed as elements of P can be infinity large themselves?

Even though I can order the rationals in a way that SEEMS like it should cover all of them, how do I know that I'm not missing something the way I am with P? (P mapped with the naturals would have to contain an element which is the subset of all natural numbers which don't map to an element of P of which they are a part, and that element of P could not be mapped to any of the natural numbers) Same goes with the fact that ANY ordering of the reals, no matter how systematic, will always miss 0.(not the 10th place of the first one)(not the 100th place of the second one)(not the 1000th place of the third one)(etc.).

I think I pretty much have it but a few incidental details are bugging me.

The first thing is to do with Wikipedia's description of refinements of partitions: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set

&gt;A partition α of a set X is a refinement of a partition ρ of X—and we say that α is finer than ρ and that ρ is coarser than α—if every element of α is a subset of some element of ρ. Informally, this means that α is a further fragmentation of ρ. In that case, it is written that α ≤ ρ.

So, the definition allows for α to be a refinement of ρ with α = ρ, because the elements of α do not have to be a proper subsets of elements of ρ. This implies α and ρ are (trivial) refinements of each other, which I can accept. But I can't accept that we can say α is finer than ρ and ρ is coarser than α in this case. Those terms should only apply in the case where we can write α &lt; ρ.

Is this correct? Maybe I'm getting bogged down in minutiae, but it's frustrating when I feel I'm clear about everything apart from some stupid detail.

The other thing has to do with a demonstration given in lots of sources that the set/cut S = {a: a is rational, a^2 &lt; 2 or a &lt; 0} has no largest member. This is intuitively clear to me, but the proof involves showing that for any proposed largest element of S, called x, we can find a larger element of S using the formula (2x + 2) / (x + 2)

I can see this formula works, but how do we derive the formula?

I know we could say that since x^2 is less than two, 2 - x^2 will give us some positive rational number m/n, so we need an x' such that 0 &lt; 2-x'^2 &lt; m/n, but then I get stuck.",,False,self,t5_2rdi4,1370096294.0,,,True,t3_1fgogl,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1fgogl/basic_real_analysis_partitions_and_cuts/,

This is the formula:

ap=(G Ms P^2 / 4 pi^2 )^1/3

Where G is gravitational constant, Ms is Mass of star, P is period and Pi is Pi :)

Using these arbitrary values:
Mp = 0.5 solar masses ( 1 solar mass = 1.99 x 10^30 kg)
P = 50 days

And gravitational constant = 6.67 x 10^-11 N m^2 kg^-2

Since I can resolve the units fine, its the math that I'm confused with we can omit the units for simplicity.

If I input into my calculator this:

[6.67x10^-11 x (0.5 x 1.99 x 10^30 ) x (50 x 24 x 3600)^2 ]^1/3

I think the second answer is correct, but I'm not sure.

What do mathematicians mean by complementing?

EDIT:

I figured it out!  When adding a digit, you either add a 0 or a 1 to the end of the string, by adding a 0 to the end of all of them, you are simply spitting out all of the solutions from last time or a(n-1) (I don't know how to do subtext), and by adding a 1 to the end of the string, you are invalidating all that were ok and ended in a 1 from the last one, but everything that ended in a 0 from the last one and were ok are fine.  Therefore it's:

a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2)  where n &gt; 1 and a(1) = 2, a(0) = 0.

First four applications:   
Since (0,0) ∈ S, then (0,1) ∈ S, and (1,1) ∈ S, and (2,1) ∈ S.
