So here comes my opinion; I just couldn't help myself:

Trading A-rod would be a terrible move.  He is set to make something like $33M next year, and there is no way in hell any team is going to want to take on the large majority of that.  No matter what happens with him this offseason, the Yankees are going to be paying him at least $25M.  That means that they would only have about $8M to spend on a third baseman if they truly want to lower their payroll.  A-rod is worth more than $8M even with these past 2 years not being productive (although this is because of injury problems and he was still an above average player).

tl;dr - Don't trade A-rod.  You have to pay him at least $25M anyway, so might as well keep him.",,False,self,t5_2qqfw,False,,nyy,True,t3_11r5i4,http://www.reddit.com/r/yankees/comments/11r5i4/i_have_no_self_restraint/,

1. Gardner, CF
2. Jeter, SS
3. Rodriguez, 3B
4. Cano, 2B
5. Hafner, DH
6. Granderson, LF
7. Overbay, 1B
8. Cervelli, C
9. Ichiro, RF

lineup would look like, especially when backed by a pitching staff like this:

1. Sabathia
2. Kuroda
3. Pettitte
4. Pineda
5. Hughes/Phelps/Nova

These lineups will come at the latest by mid August, leaving us with less than a month of the replacement players with Jeter running, A-rod making progress, and Granderson resuming baseball activities within 5 days. 

In 1/2 a year, it is reasonable to expect (in terms of WAR) that each position will get a healthy 1-2 win upgrade over their current status:



*SS:* 

Current: Nix, Brignac (-.2 WAR)

Future: Jeter (~1.1 WAR in 1/2 a year)

**Upgrade: 1.3 Wins**



*3B:*

Current: Adams (-0.3 WAR)

Future: Rodriguez (~1.3 WAR)

**Upgrade: 1.6 Wins**



*C:*

Current: Romine, Stewart (-0.3)

Future: Cervelli (~3.5 WAR) [.8 WAR in 17 games this season]

**Upgrade: 3.8 Wins!** (Note that this is an absolute best case scenario)


*LF:*

Current: Wells, Almonte (.4 WAR)

Future: Granderson (~1.7 WAR)

**Upgrade: 1.3 Wins**



*P:*

Current: Hughes (-.2 WAR)

Future(?): Pineda (1.2 WAR)

**Upgrade: 1.4 Wins**

OVERALL WINS GAINED: 9.4

It is reasonable to assume that the Yankees, due to a relatively easy schedule leading up to the All-Star break, will end the first half ~10 games above .500. 

With these replacements being ousted by the returning stars, the Yankees will, according to my extrapolated WAR differences, gain 8 wins by the end of the season, finishing 18/20 games above .500, or with a record near: 92-72, good for a .567 winning percentage, which, given how weak the rest of the AL is, and how competitive the AL east will be, will land the Yankees in the playoffs either in the second wild card spot, or as the winner of the division once the Sox cool down.

First of all, you have my sympathies. Jeter is a standup guy and I have mad respect for him as a player. I think most baseball fans (and sports fans in general) should put aside petty rivalries in situations like this. It must be a devastating thing for him, his loved ones, and his fans to have witnessed. Jesus, the replays really made that look painful as all get out. As a man who severely injured his left ankle earlier this year I know how painful it can be and I'm sure his was probably ten times worse.

I will admit: I cheered when the impossible happened and he didn't make his superhuman toss to first to get the out on that play-- but then he was just laying there and all my joy honestly drained from me. No one wants to see that happen to any player, especially not to a man so worthy of respect as Jeter. 

I hope he recovers well and that this injury is not career-ending. Also? If for nothing other than selfish reasons, I would prefer beating you guys with him on the roster. The fact he won't be will take a little bit off the shine of our victory should we best you in this series. On the bright side, should you win without him? That will be classic baseball awesomeness. I'll hate it, but I'll respect it.

Over at /r/motorcitykitties almost everyone shares this sentiment. There is no rejoicing; the assholes who are engaging in such behavior are being downvoted. I just wanted you to know that although we are rivals not all of us are so callous and cruel as to rejoice in a fellow human being's injury.

If Cash doesn't drive up Crawford's cost, Crawford's contract isn't as much of an albatross.  If Cash doesn't drive up Crawford's contract to $142 million, Adrian Gonzalez doesn't have as much leverage to ask for $154 million in his extension.  If those two combined don't have massively bloated contracts, maybe the Red Sox don't feel the need to dump salary.

While I'm not saying it's direct causation, I think it's just interesting how the aftereffects of a play Cash made 2 years ago are still reverberating.  Also, I think this is a terrible trade for the Red Sox, but it's hilarious to me.  They'll essentially have given up the farm in return for James Loney, some middling prospects, and salary relief.

1369412352.0,32,self.yankees,1ez7ut,Advanced metrics and the Yankees this season.,chordnine,35,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/yankees/comments/1ez7ut/advanced_metrics_and_the_yankees_this_season/,"**[BABIP - Batting Average on Balls in Play.](http://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitching/babip/)** Essentially, this stat recognizes that a batter has very little control over whether the ball goes for a hit or an out after making contact. Overall, 30% of all balls put into play go for hits. If a player is higher than .300, they will regress towards the mean, if they are lower, they may be coming up on a hot streak. There are exceptions...fast players might average .350 because they beat out infield plays at first, so you have to look at career BABIP, but overall the stat is fairly accurate.

**[wRC+ - Weighted Runs Created Plus](http://www.fangraphs.com/library/offense/wrc/).** Shows how a players weighted Runs created compares to everyone in the league, with 60 being average, and 100 being excellent.

**[WAR - Wins Above Replacement.](http://www.fangraphs.com/library/misc/war/)** An incredibly inclusive stat that expresses a players overall contribution to a team, expressed in the wins the team gets because of the player. For instance, if someone is valued at 1.5 WAR, it means that they are worth 1.5 wins to the team.

**Lets take a look at how the Yankees are doing this year ([source:fangraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=8&amp;season=2013&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2013&amp;ind=0&amp;team=9&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=3,d))**

Robinson Cano - BABIP .283 - wRC+ 133 - WAR 1.6

Brett Gardner - BABIP .318 - wRC+ 93 - WAR 1.1

Vernon Wells - BABIP .285 - wRC+ 125 - WAR 1.5

Lyle Overbay - BABIP .263 - wRC+ 98 - WAR 0.4

Ichiro Suzuki - BABIP .264 - wRC+ 56 - WAR -0.2

Jayson Nix - BABIP .309 - wRC+ 55 - WAR 0.0

Travis Hafner - BABIP .297 - wRC+ 147 - WAR 0.8

Eduardo Nunez - BABIP .242 - wRC+ 55 - WAR -0.6

Chris Stewart - BABIP .263 - wRC+ 87 - WAR 0.5

Austin Romine - BABIP .211 - wRC+ -14 - WAR -0.4

David Adams - BABIP .316 - wRC+ 153 - WAR 0.3

**Now some of my analysis**

**Cano'**s career BABIP is .320, which means that he hasn't been getting lucky and having balls fall in front of outfielders. Instead, he is performing at a high level despite having a lower BABIP than his career. Dude is a beast, and if that returns to his average, we could be in for a real show.

**Gardner** is having an excellent year for a guy that has struggled to stay on the field. Gardner is right at his career BABIP (.319), so if he stays healthy, there is no reason that he could not keep this pace up.

**Vernon Wells** and Lyle Overbay have been AMAZING for us this year, GREAT pickups by Cashman. Vernon is just over his career BABIP (.285), and is on pace to have his best WAR year since 2006. Last year he put up a 0.4 WAR for the year, and now he is already at 1.5. Unbelievable. His power (ISO) his higher than it has been since 2010.

**Lyle** is under his career BABIP, and a solid contributor with Runs created and WAR. His ISO his higher than at any year in his career, so he may stop slugging as he has, but that could also be affected by the short porch and the kevin long effect. Great pickup.

**Ichiro** has a career BABIP of .346 (although in 2011 it was .295, and in 2012 .300). What this tells me is that he is getting unlucky, and only 26% of balls hit are going for hits, compared to his average of 30-35%.

**Hafner** has been excellent in all categories, and leads the Yankees in wRC+. An awesome DH pickup, and his BABIP shows that this pace could be sustainable.

Alright, thats enough for me. Overall, I think Cashman has put together an amazing team considering what these guys have done with 11 DL players.

* Cano - WTF man. You are supposed to be our #1 bat. A few bad strike calls, but there were pitches where he would normally drive, but now fouling them off. What happened between the end of the regular season and the postseason? It's like day and night.

* Arod - He looks lost, out of sync, and completely guessing in his at bats. He is not swinging with authority. I know he is physically capable of wrecking the ball, but his mental approach is not there at all. Completely lost. Is the media, fans, and the pressure getting to his head? Probably, but whatever it is, he needs to snap out of it.

* Swisher - Needs to stop clowning around. We all know his antics, but it disgusts me to see him smiling after a ground out or pop out. Call me old school, but I want to see these guys get angry at themselves for not producing in big situations.

* Granderson - Two strikes, and the pitcher will throw in the dirt, and guess what? Strike three. I don't have statistics, but it feels like well over 75% of the time he will swing at a ball in the dirt with 2 strikes. Seriously, I feel like he will always swing at it, hoping the ball doesn't curve down in to the dirt.

* On the other hand, Ichiro, Jeter, even Teixera have been producing. Oh, did I mention Raul Ibanez? He is pretty much our entire offense now, but we cannot keep relying on him. With Jeter out now, even Cashman stated the best way to honor Jeter is for the rest of the guys to step up. Maybe it's just me, but I didn't see that fire in our lineup. Did you? 

* This doesn't feel so much like a team effort as it does a bunch of solo guys bundled together. Martin looked decent early on, definitely different that earlier in the season when he was severely struggling. Catching and batting for what, 4 days straight has definitely tired him at least a bit.

* All season long, we've relied on the homerun ball to score. Sure, we had patches here and there where we would play small ball, but the majority of our offense was based on homeruns. I hate when we had huge scoring opportunities with RISP, but the batters would still try to swing for the fences. A single might be better in some cases, because it'll get the lineup moving - what I mean is you don't have to rely on guys getting big hits...you keep the ball rolling!

* It feels as if our entire offense waits for the pitchers to make a mistake. Case in point: Valverde - he was far from lights out, and we were able to score 4 on him, yet we couldn't score against supposedly good starting pitching. Are our bats overly disciplined? It could work against average teams, but in the postseason, you don't and shouldn't expect average pitching. Should we start chasing border pitches and instead of putting up a homerun swing, aim for a bloop single or a solid liner up the middle?


**Pitching**

Starting pitching has been AMAZING. All of our starters have kept us in the game. CC, Pettitte, Kuroda, even Hughes kept us in the Baltimore game. Going on short rest, putting up zeros, getting out of jams, and not allowing a blowup inning - We can't ask for more. It's unfortunate when a botched call such as tonight's led to 2 more runs (although it most likely would not have mattered). Our middle bullpen guys haven't necessarily been getting the job done, and that is frustrating.

It is PAINFUL to see the team play like this. Thanks for reading. What are your thoughts?

I keep telling myself this, while fighting back tears for the man that I've watched for almost two decades. I keep trying to think that baseball is just for our entertainment, three or so hours a day. I still have to go to work today, and care for my life. But, I can't help but feel that I have a vested interest in the careers of people like Mariano and Derek, or Donnie Baseball. 
We want to see Mo go out on his terms, whether it be the far-fetched hope for 700 saves, or to the cheers and adulation of 50,000 fans this September. It has an emotional quality to it, that it is in some ways as important to me as it is to him. I find myself not caring about the Yankees' season as much. They win more championships than any team in sports, they lose just like everyone else the rest of the time. But, this is personal, like Lou Gehrig. Mariano Rivera personifies what it means to be a Yankee, and it breaks my heart to see one of the greats fall. Not because of drugs, womanizing, laziness, or loss of ability, but because he was shagging fly balls. 
I don't think I care if the Yankees win tonight, it's not the same. Tomorrow I'll feel differently, but today I just feel like we've lost, regardless of the outcome of the game. 
I cry for Mo, and I wish him well. After all he has given us, he deserves to have his day. ",,False,self,t5_2qqfw,False,,,True,t3_t6x8o,http://www.reddit.com/r/yankees/comments/t6x8o/thoughts_on_the_loss_of_mo/,

Growing up a Red Sox fan in the 90's and 2000's there have been three Yankees that I have really respected; Jeter, Posada, and Rivera. Hearing the news that Rivera may never pitch again was upsetting because I knew that the greatest closer of all time wouldn't be able to end his Hall of Fame career on his own terms. I empathize with all Yankee fans regarding this. I desperately hope he can recover from this and pitch again.

We'll be at Yankee Stadium on Friday, August 30, for a game vs. the Orioles.

We try to keep it as cheap as possible and typically walk around the park anyway, so the seat location isn't a big deal since we'll probably go as cheap as possible anyway. **I'm wondering, though, if we're better off buying as soon as single game tickets go on sale through the team website or if I'm better off going through StubHub later?** I'm assuming Friday night at Yankee Stadium is a tougher ticket to get, so getting them ASAP is better, but thought you all would know better than me.

Also, **if anyone has any food recommendations either in or around the ballpark, I'd love to hear them**.

After next year, it drops to 1.15/game for two years, then to 1.05 for two seasons, then to .95 for the final. I also imported the 2013 schedule for the purpose of approx. dates.

The results:
He will pass Hank Aaron for sole possession of 3rd all time on June 8, 2015
DJ4K will occur on August 2nd, 2016
On August 23, 2017, Jeter will pass Ty Cobb for second all time
On May 8th, 2018, Derek Jeter will become the all time hits leader, passing Pete Rose with 4257 hits.

Just thought I'd share how I spend my sleepless nights. Go Yankees.

I'm thinking he needs to be at the top of the list as far as potential trades before the July 31 deadline.  I'm not even sure who would want him/who we would potentially get for him, but I can't stand watching him go to 2 strikes and have 10 pitch at bats before he finally gives up a big hit.

I have been a Yankees fan for 19 years (ever since I was a infant) and the one Yankee player I have followed is Derek Jeter.

1372736048.0,13,self.yankees,1hh2tw,This is how it starts.,Kroxzy,17,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/yankees/comments/1hh2tw/this_is_how_it_starts/,"Three things had to happen for the Yankees to break their 5 game slide:

1. HITS. The Yankees recorded double digit hits, including 4 with RISP, a step up from the 0-8 performance in the finale against the O's. In addition, they scored their most runs since May 16th, showing that they are truly improving from the clusterfuck that was mid-to-late June.

2. PITCHING. Though it didn't seem like it, the Yankee pitching performance was actually fantastic. Apart from the first inning, Pettitte allowed 1 run on three hits and was able to shut down the Twins in almost every RISP situation, allowing his only run outside of the 1st on a golf home run off of a great slider.

3. LUCK. Even though the Yanks hit well and pitched pretty well, we have to admit, we were helped out by luck: the error that put Nix on in front of Cano, which led to a game tying homer, the ""single"" by Ichrio off of an errant throw by Burton, and the botched pickoff attempt.

Though I would have preferred a game involving more of the first two and less of the third, this was a great start for the Yankees in order to break a losing streak and begin a new winning streak.

**In Terms of Hitting:**  Wells is (hopefully) heating up, Cano's on fire, Almonte is getting big hits and is hitting for average, Hafner had good swings (the monster shot he hit foul that traveled ~450 feet) and Gardner continues to be a great leadoff hitter.

**In Terms of Injuries:** The injury bug has plagued the Yankees for the entire season. However, there is a silver lining: the Yanks have performed surprisingly well with a lineup full of replacements. Though this is the case, there is no one in the Yankee fanbase who does not yearn for the day when Adams, Nix, Romine and Wells are out of the starting lineup. This seems like it will happen around July 25-August 7th:

**Rodriguez** will begin his rehab assignment on the 2nd, meaning he will be activated on the 22nd, giving us, hopefully, only 16 days of automatic outs from Adams. 

**Granderson's** hand has healed completely, but he still can not grip a bat, so he is realistically a bit under a month away.

**Cervelli** is taking batting practice, and if the time from BP-to-Rehab Assignent for A-rod is any indication, Cervelli will be back around the 26th or 27th, just in time for the first home series after the all star break.

**Jeter** is running, taking BP, facing pitching in simulated games-- pretty much anything but going to AA to begin his rehab assignment. Though the Yanks will be more cautious with Jeter than A-Rod due to the nature of the injury and the previous setback, I expect a rehab assignment to begin later this week, with Jeter returning in unison with Cervelli.

This is pretty much all good news and will most likely result in the Yankees returning to their winning ways, and, optimistically winning the division once the Sox return to earth.

Yes, the Yankees are slugging at a prodigious rate.  Yes, I love seeing Yankees in five of the top 10 spots in the AL HR leaderboards.  However, relying this much on the home run for offense somewhat worries me.  It's completely infeasible to expect Russel Martin, Jorge Posada, or Curtis Granderson to keep up their current 60-HR pace.  Hell, I don't even think Mark Teixiera can keep it up.  A-Rod, well, you never know, but it's also highly unlikely that he'll finish the season with 60.

On the other hand, Nick Swisher has yet to hit a dinger, and I think we can count on him for between 20-30.

And of course, this worry may all go away - if the Yankees stop bombing the ball at this rate, they may just translate those at bats to the hits that haven't been coming with runners on base, thus making it all a wash.  So, I remain cautiously optimistic - it's all well and good when we're knocking out 2 HRs/game, but I would like to see at least the possibility of a little small ball diversity.

1375661063.0,14,self.yankees,1jpir8,MLB to Allow Alex Rodriguez to Play during Appeal of Suspension,iamnotamarxist,23,9,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/yankees/comments/1jpir8/mlb_to_allow_alex_rodriguez_to_play_during_appeal/,"Preface: I'm sorry to post another A-Rod Biogenesis thread. I get it, we're sick of this jamoke. I'm just as sick as anyone of Alex but I'm beyond pissed at the possibility of him suiting up on Monday night in Chicago.

There I was, experiencing the first moments of the reality that would become Alex Rodriguez's fate through the last chapter of his career. As multiple media outlets began to report that A-Rod would be suspended through at least the 2014 season, I reacted with what could be described as controlled jubilation. Finally, the road ended for Alex. There was no more dwindling hope on his behalf that the efforts of MLB would be hampered by the logistics of law. Instead, the writing was apparently on the wall. Alex Rodriguez wouldn't be playing baseball until at least 2015. It seemed impossible to circumvent this discipline. A-Rod's petulance sounded increasingly surreal. ""The only way I'm not playing is if I'm struck by lightning"" while being positioned in front of a Trenton Thunder mascot that held a lightning bolt added a comedic irony to the idea that A-Rod was out of touch with a reality dictating that he would finally be subjected to justice.

But here we are today. Reports have circulated stating that the Commissioner's Office will not exercise the best interested of baseball clause in an effort to ban Alex from playing during the appeals process. Just hours ago, I had maligned Alex for being out of touch with reality because he believed that he would join the Yankees in Chicago tomorrow night. Apparently, I'm the one that's delusional because I truly believed that MLB would finally discipline baseball's black sheep.

The idea that Alex Rodriguez will be allowed to play during the appeal of his suspension is an absolute joke. I'm not going to talk about evidence, because I'm not privy to knowing what evidence the league has against him. I'm not going to speculate. All I'm going to do is ask questions: What in the name of BABE RUTH'S GHOST do you have to do to get what you have coming to you if you're Alex Rodriguez? Is it as simple as actually having to fail a PED test? If MLB that naive to believe that the man who has been paid the two largest contracts in league history can't afford to be a step ahead of the testing process? DOES ANYONE GIVE A SHIT ABOUT AFFORDING ALEX DUE PROCESS OF LAW? Justice fails time after time in our society, in situations of greater magnitude that outweigh the trivial nature of a man who plays a game begging for a fairness that he never reciprocated.

I'm just sick of this asshole. When I was growing up, I became enamored with the New York Yankees. I was a child learning to read who utilized the documentation of our clubs rich history to familiarize himself with the romance of the pinstriped uniform that legends from Ruth to Jeter donned. The affection that grew between myself and the team I still love all these years later still burns deep, even when they can't beat the fucking Ian Kennedy and the Padres. That love I have, that knowledge I possess of our club's legacy just reinforces the fact that Alex doesn't deserve to wear the uniform he is determined to wear tomorrow night.

I'm tired of making excuses dependent on legal rationale. I'm tired of justifying why A-Rod deserves a life-time ban. All I'm saying is that Alex Rodriguez is a cheater, a liar and a disgrace to the Yankees, if not all of baseball. I hope he does get struck by lightning.",,False,self,t5_2qqfw,False,,nyy-5,True,t3_1jpir8,http://www.reddit.com/r/yankees/comments/1jpir8/mlb_to_allow_alex_rodriguez_to_play_during_appeal/,

So I have made it my goal to try and start a thread almost every day about the Yankees where hopefully we can get a ton of comments going. I also read that some people for one reason or another are intimidated (either by being female, non-american, or new the the sport. There is no reason for people to be scared of posting, as I know I won't judge anyone for anything.

Anyway, on to my post. Mariano IMHO is the greatest Yankee of all time. This does not mean that he is the greatest player to have played for the Yankees (I think that goes to Ruth) but just the greatest Yankee. Here are my reasons:

* **He's played his whole career for the Yankees.** He's going to retire this year as a Yankee and will have spent his whole career this. This is why I have him over guys like Ruth and Clemens. Yes everyone thinks of Ruth as a Yankee, but he made his fame originally as a Red Sock. 

* **He's won World Series Rings.** This is what puts him over Don Mattingly, who everyone loves. The Yankees are the most successful franchise in sports history, and in order to be considered the best in our great franchise, you have to win it all.

* **He's had an incredibly long career and aged gracefully.** It is is incredibly rare for a baseball player to still be playing at age 43, nonetheless be as fantastic as Mo has been this year. I'm extremely impressed with him this year, and it's rare for a 43 year old to be retiring and most fans to wish he could come back for a couple more years.

* **He's the only player in baseball history to be undisputed as to who's the best player at his position.** This is why he wins it for me. He is the only player you talk about who's the best reliever of all time. For outfielders you could argue Mays, Aaron, Ruth or Bonds.

Yes, a couple of bats would help, but I think our problems extend past a couple of bats to plug in. 

I'd rather we keep our prospects ... and further, I'd like us to pick up some more prospects. 

We can only buy so much any year. Jeter, Pettitte, Rivera, Cano, Robertson, and Gardner are all home-grown players, players who came through our minor-league system. Never underestimate the power of growing up a Yankee. 

So if we can trade players like Hughes, Ichiro, Overbay, Granderson and Youkilis when they're healthy, and Joba if we can get anything whatsoever for him, it might not be the worst thing ever.

The two things I don't like about this are 1) I hate the idea of giving up, and 2) I wish Mo would go out a winner, but at the same time we have to be realistic here. We need to build for the future, especially if Hal &amp; Co. want to maintain a somewhat reasonable budget.",,False,self,t5_2qqfw,False,,nyy-1,True,t3_1hcu4v,http://www.reddit.com/r/yankees/comments/1hcu4v/the_case_for_selling/,
