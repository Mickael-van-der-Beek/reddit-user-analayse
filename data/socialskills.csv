1373290185.0,1208,self.socialskills,1hv1ut,Former shy here. I recently did a 30-day social experiment in which I talked to at least three strangers every day. Here's what I learned.,slass-y,1487,279,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1hv1ut/former_shy_here_i_recently_did_a_30day_social/,"(I did this for my blog which is all about self-development, but self-promotion makes me feel dirty and I am more interested in just helping you guys out on here. If anyone really wants the link I can post it. **EDIT: Someone asked, so here it is: http://andrewelsass.com/. All five posts about the project are currently on the front page**)

Small backstory: First 22 years of my life was painfully shy, socially unconfident, had terrible self-esteem. Last 2-3 years I have become fascinated by self-development and humans' ability to change themselves into whoever they want to be. I did this project because I had recently moved to a new city for the third time in 12 months and frequently had conversations with old friends that were in similar situations and had no idea on how to construct a new social circle from scratch.

**My five biggest takeaways:**

**1. Pursue Your Passions**:  Not surprisingly, of all the people I met, the ones I vibed with best were those that I had a mutual interest with from the beginning, be it CrossFit, swing dancing, or hanging out in coffee shops.

Many in my generation seem to be under the impression that friends will just apparate like they did in grade school and college. Sorry, but it’s a different ball game now. Building friendships takes consistent effort. It takes work. But that work can be made easier by going out and doing whatever it is you love most, or going out and trying a new hobby. I imagine volunteering and religious groups are also great ways to meet like-minded people. Do this enough and your world will become smaller and smaller, as the more you put yourself out into the community, the more you will begin to see the same people.

**2. Hot and Un-bothered:** One limiting belief I used to have towards starting conversations in public was that I would be bothering people. Sure, there are times when this could be the case, but it is quickly learned when someone is genuinely busy and probably not in the mood to chit-chat versus someone that is aimlessly killing time on their phone.

How I like to think about it is this- if I were in that person’s situation, and someone cheerful and confident started talking to me, would I be annoyed, or not mind at all?

99% of the people I talked to were extremely polite back- people in general are nicer than we give them credit for. And the two or three people (out of 118 total) that ignored me or just said ‘Yeah’ and walked away? Chances are they weren’t worth my time trying to get to know them anyway, they themselves weren’t very confident people, or who knows, maybe they were having the worst day of their life. Or maybe they just didn’t have anything to say. No harm, no foul. 

The amount of people that were even remotely ‘weirded out’ by me I could probably count on one hand, and although I can come on strong (perhaps overcompensating slightly from my shy days) this happened even less than I would have predicted. 

**3. Quick on the Draw:** Also reinforced, but still extremely important, turned out to be the power of not hesitating when starting conversations. No matter how anti-social, socially awkward, whatever, someone paints themselves to be, they will never come off that way if they start a conversation- no, even just acknowledge someone- within the first three seconds that they are near them. This is a sign of assertiveness, of confidence, of power in a person.

Waiting not only rifles every excuse a person can think of not to say anything through their head, it also aggrandizes those beliefs that they aren’t a confident person, are socially awkward, and all the other nonsense people tell themselves.

The trick is acting so fast that the mind doesn’t have time to tell the body all the reasons it shouldn’t be doing this.

**4. The Lonely Socialites:** The biggest surprise to me was not anything that I learned through any of the interactions, but instead from my existing friends. Coincidentally through conversation with a few of my peers- not even always about the experiment- I learned that an extremely high percentage of them wished they were more social.

It was a refreshing feeling to discover that becoming more social and personable was not something that only I was interested in, but was a struggle many people, especially in my age group, can relate to. A lot of these people, to me, seemed like socially active individuals, too- they just wait for someone else to make the first move. Be that someone else.

**5. Everyone and Their Brother:** 

Ultimately, the most important thing, again, is to talk to everyone. I can’t state the importance of this enough. Through chatting up random people I had a 2-hour conversation at a bar about life, the universe, and everything in between. I found out about a somewhat-secret series of acoustic shows hosted by a small local blogger in my city, and also became pretty good friends with a neighbor in my apartment complex during this experiment. 

Talking to everyone will make you happier, make you smarter, make you more confident, get you more friends, get you more dates, get you a better job, and make you see that the people of this world are inherently good.

And because really, it only takes one person to change your life.
--

To anyone that wishes they were more social- I highly recommend doing something like this. Keep data, use Stickk.com, anything that will make you accountable. It's about gaining momentum, and that momentum eventually turns into a habit.

**TL;DR:** Do shit you are interested in, you aren't annoying people, act fast, you're not alone, talk to *everyone.*

Thus the pronouns will be male and the situations will be college-oriented, but this stuff applies to any gender in any situation.**

When you meet a guy or group of guys for the first time, you're gonna want to be pretty high energy.  Smile and laugh.  Don't try to be ""cool"" or stand-offish.  It just makes you seem like a dick.  Remember people tend to think everything is about themselves.  If you're quiet and reserved around them, they won't think you're shy, they'll just think you don't like them or have no interest in talking to them.  Also, the energy shouldn't be initially focused on them, but on the situation you're in.  

Start talking to them like you know them, standard info can be exchanged later.

So, for example, let's say I've walked into a lecture hall to take a test and I sit down next to some dude:

-------------------
ME: [grinning] You ready to crush this or what?

HIM: [noticing me for the first time] Ha, let's hope so man.

ME: Yeah I haven't slept in 22 hours, I better fucking do well on this test.

HIM: [feeling more at ease] Yeah same here man, pretty sure my veins have nothing but Red Bull flowing through them.

[laughs]

ME: [extending my hand, focusing on him for the first time] I'm Andrew.

HIM: [shaking my hand] Rob.

ME: Hey did you study the handouts he gave us?  I'm screwed if they're on the test.
_______________

Notice how I began talking to him like he was already a buddy of mine, not like someone I have to ""get to know.""  I began the conversation focused on the situation we were in (about to take a test), and did so lightheartedly, not in any kind of serious way.  I also made it clear that I had no agenda-- not even to make a friend.  I was just looking to shoot the shit before taking a test.  Only after some back-and-forth did I introduce myself, and I did so with an attitude of  ""hmm, you seem cool, what's up?""--without actually saying that.  And I did introduce myself fairly quickly.  There's no need to drag a conversation on and on before you introduce yourself.  Do whatever feels natural.

Notice also that I went right back to our conversation after I introduced myself.  Don't fall into the trap of interviewing them all at once, i.e. ""what's your major? what dorm are you in? what other classes are you taking?"" This just makes things awkward and unnatural.  Learn about each other slowly as you have a conversation about something else.

I also began the conversation happy and high-energy.  I was grinning, and my 'opening line' (Are you ready to crush this?) almost sounds like something a coach would say to his players before a big game.  It's high-energy and positive.  This is exactly what you need when you're becoming familiar with someone you don't know.  In fact, being positive and high-energy is a pretty good strategy for beginning any social interaction, even with someone you do know.

Finally, notice that *he responded to what I was saying*.  If someone is unresponsive when you strike up a conversation (i.e. they only give you yes or no answers or just generally don't make an effort), then to hell with them.  You are under no obligation to carry on a conversation with someone who's not willing to do their part in it.  I have cut off conversations mid-sentence with people who I thought were being unresponsive.  Sometimes I'll even turn to the person sitting on the other side of me and strike up a conversation with them.  If someone gives you a look like ""why is this guy talking to me?,"" then that person is AN ASSHOLE.  There is nothing weird about talking to the people in your immediate vicinity.  This is a reflection of their own social incompetency, *not yours*.  

You have to get rid of this mindset that ""I'm talking to this guy to make him like me.""  You are talking to this guy to see if you get along *with each other*.  If you don't--that's fine.  Just move on to the next person.  A solid 75% of the people you meet are not going to connect with you very well.  That's just the way it is.  Don't sweat it and certainly don't take it personally.  

When you guys are getting ready to go your separate ways (i.e. the test is over), then if your conversation felt good and natural, and you genuinely like the person GET THEIR NUMBER.  Yes, this will often feel a little awkward but it is imperative that you do this if you want to continue the conversation.  If you know you're going to see them again (i.e. you're in the same class), you can sometimes wait and just say ""Good to meet you man I'll see you on Monday.""  Otherwise, say ""Hey it was great to meet you man, we should hang out sometime.""  See how they respond to this.  They may well suggest that you exchange numbers, in which case you exchange numbers.  Or they might be a little shy and afraid to suggest that you exchange numbers and they might just say ""yeah we should man.""  So just say ""alright why don't you give me your number and I'll text you.""  

Once you get their number, text them right away with your name so they know who you are and have you saved in their phonebook.  The text can be very short, something like ""yo it's Andrew,"" or the like.  Then you ACTUALLY HAVE TO TEXT THEM.  Do not expect them to text you even if they asked for your number.  Most people will forget about you very quickly because they have lives going on.  You will almost always have to make the first effort.  You can text them anytime from a couple days later to a couple weeks later.  If you sit on a number for more than a couple weeks, however, there is very little chance that they will remember you and it can even come off a little weird that you still remember them weeks later.  Don't procrastinate too long.

It's much better to first invite them to a group activity if possible.  A sports game, a party, a study session.  This takes the pressure off both of you to make conversation and allows you to observe them in a group of your friends and see how comfortable you feel around them, and them around you.  If you find at this point that you don't really like them or feel good around them, then you are under no obligation to text them again.  If you do like them, invite them to another activity or just to hang out, get food, watch TV or whatever.  The activities can become more and more casual as you get familiar with them.  After you've invited them out two or three times, they should start asking you to hang out, at least some of the time.  If they don't, I would stop texting them until they text you.  Remember a relationship is two-sided and they must put in their effort.  You can make the initial contact but eventually it has to become a joint effort.

It's pretty much smooth sailing from here on out.  As long as you open yourself up and spend time with them (remember that--openness and time) you will become increasingly better friends.  

A couple last pointers:

1) Who you are is always good enough.  If you have to be someone you're not to get them to like you, *you are not compatible with each other*.  Don't waste time on people who are not going to be your good friends.

2) Don't settle ever.  You deserve friends who like and respect you.  If you have a friend who likes hanging out with you but doesn't respect you (i.e. always puts you down, ditches you for other people, talks behind your back), call him out on it.  If he keeps doing it, then cut him out of your life.  He's not worth it.

3) Having friends is supposed to be fun.  If a friend stresses you out more than he makes you happy, he's not worth having around.  If it takes forever to get out of that ""getting to know you"" zone with a person, you're probably not compatible.  This doesn't mean they're a bad person or even a bad friend--it just means you're not compatible.  Forcing a relationship with them will only make both of you unhappy.

We were supposed to have dinner but as it was early we decided to hang out in the mall for a while.  
So we were window shopping and she was trying out some dresses. We were having a lot of fun. Then she suddenly decides that she likes a dress and she must buy it. Then she looks at the price tag and declares she doesn't have enough. Then she looks at me with goofy eyes as if expecting me to offer her to buy the dress for her. I took the hint but did not respond.  
I don't know why but she assumed that I was gonna pay for her dress so she puts the dress in the basket and starts looking at other dresses. After a while I tell her that maybe we should leave and head to dinner. She agrees and proceeds to go to the counter and gives the dress for billing. I am thoroughly confused as to why she is buying the dress if she doesn't have the money. Then the guy behind the counter asks for the money and she is just standing and looking at me. I am like wtf?   
I got pretty pissed off and told her rather angrily that I am not buying the  fucking dress because why should I? We are just on a date and you can't expect me to pay for anything and what have you done to deserve my money?  
She was pretty shocked with my response as I don't think she is used to guys telling her no. It was pretty embarrassing for her. I told her I am waiting outside and would drop her home and then I left. She never showed up and after waiting for 20 minutes I just left.  
Now the question is, I am sure there is a way to deal with it politely and that's where I need your help. If in a situation like this, what should one do to avoid sounding like a jerk and still carry on with the date. It's not that I couldn't pay for her, I just don't want to feel used.

If you are reading this, yours can too!",MyFairLady77,571,93,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/15lzss/thank_you_rsocialskills_my_life_has_changed_if/,"I have been reading /r/socialskills for the past one month. And let me tell you, these have been the happiest 30 days of my entire life.     
  
Some background about me. I am a 20 year old sophomore at an American college. I have spent the past two decades of my life having awkward conversations with people and being a complete introvert. I spent my entire freshman year lying on my bunk bed watching TV shows and never going to class (or for that matter, any event involving a lot of people). I wouldn't even go to the dining halls for for the fear of having to strike a conversation with an acquaintance. I would instead order in. I absolutely hated meeting new people. I never even liked spending time with my own family. In short, I was a recluse who hated humanity in general. Negativity was a part of blood stream, and I would always think the worst of human intentions.     
  
I stumbled upon this sub-reddit by pure chance. And what a happy accident it was. As a started browsing through it, I came across some extraordinary posts, ideas and experiences that have changed my life in the following ways :-

1. I have become a very, very social person. So much so that my friend circle has tripled in one month.  

2. Two girls have asked me out in this 30 day period. And let me assure you, I'm no Jake Gyllenhaal . Just an average looking person with a very sensitive ego. Before this ""overhaul"", I could hardly talk to a girl without making the conversation utterly awkward for me and her. 

3. I have made dinner conversations at home fun. Some background on this. My family is one of those dysfunctional families you see at a restaurant, just sitting there bored with no one talking to each other. But now, we talk. I make them all talk. I engage them. We are all happier! No more awkward dinner talk.

4. I have become a more patient, calm, and generally, happy person. I radiate happiness, if you will. I try to make everyone around me happy as well. And doing this in turn makes me even happier!

How did I achieve all of this? What posts and experiences did I read that helped me change. I will summarize what I specifically did to achieve this. For me, this was truly a mantra for life. And perhaps, it can be for you too! Keep reading!

There is no other virtue as powerful and life-changing than **confidence**. Sadly enough, I have never been a very confident person; and you may feel you're in the same boat too. I have always been too involved in thinking what the other person might think if I say this or if I say that. Now on, I look a person straight in the eye (the left eye, to be precise), and smile. And talk. And engage. But most importantly, amuse myself. And you know what, for a significant part of this process, **I faked it**. I faked being confident. I faked being interested. I faked it all -- until I actually started exuding confidence! Until I actually became confident! [This Ted Talks video on powerful body language] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc&amp;amp;amp;noredirect=1) Her thoughts on powerful body language are indeed helpful, but what was most instrumental was one part from her speech - **""Fake it till you make it""**. Again, I cannot stress how helpful this was for me. I recommend everyone to watch this video. 

Every morning, I leave my house and try to talk to a complete stranger; it may be the lady that works at 5 Guys, or a person standing next to me waiting for the pedestrian signal to go green. I talk about anything that comes to mind. I call it **breaking the social barrier**. This process helps me loosen up and get rid of my social anxiety. It is VERY helpful.

I walk with a straight, confident posture, and smile at any person who makes eye contact with me on the streets. I walk like a boss, like I own the place. I always try to radiate happiness and bring a positive attitude to any conversation I have. I never look at the ground when I feel awkward. If I'm feeling uncomfortable, I lose the awkwardness and be awesome instead. I fake it until I make it. The old me would look at his phone whenever he's in a group of people and feeling out of place. The new me will never do this. He will try to add **small bits** to the conversation until he feels comfortable and can converse properly.

Every morning when I wake up, I talk to myself in the mirror. I tell myself how awesome I am, and how much I love myself. In truth, you cannot do the ""fake till you make it"" technique unless you **love yourself**. Unless you're proud of yourself. I really do love the new me. This confidence and 'fake till you make it' thing has truly changed my life in so many ways I cannot express. I don't know how helpful this post is, but I felt I needed to say thanks to this community. Everything I have said in the post is something I have read on this very sub-reddit. To be honest, most of the things I have read here are things I already knew but never had a chance to really think and introspect about them - for e.g., a simple mantra like ""Be Yourself"" is so deep that it's been passed around since ages, but we never think about what it means. It means to love yourself, to not be afraid of what you want to say, to be happy being you! 

In short -- all my life I was a fucked up introverted teenager from a dysfunctional family who couldn't have a conversation with another human being and was scared of intimacy, but only one month of trying, and I'm a new person. A happy person. And you know what's the best part, you can do this too. All you need to is believe in yourself and love yourself for who you are. Thank you for reading!

Edit: adding some very important stuff about eye contact.  
One point I did not seem to stress enough was making **eye contact**. It engages people so much! Without it, it's like no one is listening to them. Think about a confident, charismatic person you know... Someone you look up to. There is a great chance that he or she always makes eye contact when they talk to you. Now don't just keep staring at them, that's a bit creepy. Shift of your gaze from time to time, but for about 70% of the conversation you should be maintaining eye contact. I usually look at the left eye.  Eye contact WILL make the person you are talking to way **more interested** in having a conversation with you, and it does show a lot of confidence!",,False,,t5_2r275,1356762050.0,,,True,t3_15lzss,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/15lzss/thank_you_rsocialskills_my_life_has_changed_if/,

I posted it in /r/self and got downvoted to oblivion, so I'll try my luck here....

Let me start off by saying that I don't think I fit the stereotypical 'forever-alone' persona (whatever that may be?). I'm well-educated (graduate degree). I'm kind and caring. I pay close attention to the clothes I wear and I try to always look my best. I'm friendly, but maybe a bit shy. I exercise on a regular basis and I have quite a few hobbies. But for some reason, I've failed miserably when it comes to human relationships. I can't seem to get that 'connection' with other people and I can't progress past being just an 'acquaintance'. The few women who have gotten to know me have said ""you would be an amazing catch (for somebody else)"". I want to be perfectly clear though, this isn't a rant about the friend-zone. It's more of a rant about .. not having a solid and meaningful relationship (platonic, romantic, or otherwise) with another human being.

I know that I'm not perfect and each day I try to work to improve myself. I read a lot and I love learning about things, so I always have things to talk about, but I honestly just don't know what my problem is. I feel like there is something wrong with me. I'm not a religious/superstitious person, but I swear there is something written somewhere in the universe that says I am doomed to be alone! Hell, throughout all of elementary school, we were a class of 31. Whenever there was partners, I was always the one who worked alone. Everybody seemed to have a best-friend except for me. I try to remain optimistic and I go out of my way to change this.. but I have had NO luck so far.

I admit there are a few barriers though when it comes to 'getting out'. I don't particularly enjoy partying and I abstain completely from drinking alcohol or doing drugs (substance abuse runs deep in my family, and have an 'addicting personality' to begin with, so I'm not willing to risk it). The few times that I have gone out to the bar, parties, whatever, I'm always the designated driver. I'm fine with this, but what it usually turns into is that people will rely on me to be the designated driver and they'll get mad at me if I'm not willing to go out with them because there is something else I want to do (these ""relationships"" degrade quickly and I don't really bother with getting myself into that situation anymore).

I can honestly say it was the best night of my life.,CorkyPal,476,75,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1bhk1u/xpost_from_rconfidence_for_one_night_of_my_life_i/,"I am an 18 year old guy. I'm very shy, awkward, social disaster spending most of my life encased indoors.
This saturday night I wen't to a concert, one of my favourite bands, Said the Whale, was opening for Stars.

I brought one of my friends along to go see them. And met up with others later on. I wasn't expecting much other than some good music. I saw this really beautiful girl standing next to me. Normally I don't say anything to anyone. But I started up a conversation with her. I started talking to her about the band, she said she came to see Said the Whale too. Once the band played I started to dance, she joined in. After the Said the whale finished playing, I asked her if she'd like to dance again when the Stars start playing. She said told me she really wanted to and I asked her for her number so we could find each other again.

She put: ""Hot girl from concert ;)"" in my contacts. Immediately I texted her saying: ""Hey, so now you have my number. From equally hot guy from concert. ;)""

We had a good laugh and said we'd meet up after. At this point I was so pumped I couldn't believe I got a girls phone number. Thats never happened to me before. I was super excited. After hanging out with my friends for a while, Stars came back on to play.

She texted me and told me to hold up my phone so she could find me. We met up and she brought me over to her friends and introduced me. We spent most of the songs dancing. I had the confidence to take her hand and twirl her around a few times she was loving it and so was I. Then a slow song came on and I was really really really wanting to hold her hand. It was practically screaming in my mind. I didn't. So we danced a bit more and then another slow song came on. I thought to myself: ""Fuck it, i'm going to hold her hand."" I slowly inched my hand towards her and put it right behind hers, I bumped it and she instantly grabbed it. And thank God the concert was dark because i would've been beet red.

We spent the rest of the concert dancing and holding hands. I've never held a girls hand before. Hell, I've never got to dance with a girl or get her phone number. I was ecstatic. After the Stars stopped playing I shook her hand and said my goodbyes. My friends were shocked I was able to even work up the courage to talk to her. Let alone do everything else. I seriously wouldn't shut up about it for the rest of the night I was so happy. And keep thinking about her still today.

I don't know where the hell that burst of confidence came from, but it gave me the best night of my life.

tl;dr - I got to hold a girls hand and i'm blooding fucking happy about it.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the really nice upbuilding comments. I really wasn't expecting this kind of response. Haha. I really wanted to share my story with others because I thought I might inspire someone else to take the chances I did that night. Which it seems like I did for a few people.

_______ 
Why do we like people?
	-If they are similar to us
		-Both personality and physical characteristics
	-Competence
		-People who can function well/efficiently are more appealing
		-People who can function too well we hold a grudge against. we hate perfect people. 

Complimentary Needs -‘opposites’
	opposites tend to attract in the short run. However in the long run, the attraction of similarity takes over and whatever connection there is tends to fall apart.
		-except for ‘complimentary needs’, i.e. one person likes to make decisions, one person likes to follow directions
			-one person is very social, other is very hesitant but enjoys it when it does happen. 
			-one is a slob, the other enjoys cleaning

Niceness - we like others who are nice to us
	-Best tactic? - Smile at people (with teeth helps)
					-promotes trustworthiness, good moods
	-People who own pets we assume are nice and trustworthy

	-Reciprocal liking - we like people proportionately to how they like us
		-Your new friend has an enemy? They are now your enemy as well. 
		-Person didn’t smile back at you? You tend to like them less. 

Proximity
	-Time and distance
		-Closer in either makes us like people more
			‘Absence makes the heart grow fonder’… well it also makes the heart look elsewhere too… sorry bout it. 
			-Skype solves some of the problems of a long distance relationship
	-Simple presence is very powerful w/ attraction

Flattery
	-Needs to come across as believable. 
		-If it does, reciprocal liking comes into play. We like them more because they seem to like us a lot.
		-If its not real, you can make it real. White lies. 
			-People are almost a big a sucker for genuiness as they are for flattery. 
			-Works for kiss-asses as well




Biggest predictor of attraction?
	-Physical attractiveness
		-When we view someone who is attractive, we give them characteristics/attributes that we would like to see in people, regardless of who they actually are.
		-When we view someone as unattractive, we give them characteristics that are viewed as negative; sloth, gluttonous, pessimist etc. 
		-In america, weight has a huge thing to do with it

Phenethylamine: Neurotransmitter associated with love. “In love”
	-Short term, usually tapers off at 4-5 years

Endorphins: ‘Love you’
	-Long term love, Endorphins replace Phenethylamine. 		-Promote Calmness, serenity, produces a sense of balance.

When a long term relationship works, you periodically generate PEA, but for all the times in between, you produce Endorphins: You feel safe, comfortable, good. Less sexual, more affectionate. You can see the person as they are. 

Best way to view a relationship ending
	-“we had a good run”, “it was worth-while”
easier to find Phenethylamines again.

Loneliness
	-A desire to feel close to ANYone. Sometimes it can be specific, but mostly anyone. 

When someone is depressed, some looks discouraged, down, unattractive.	negative feedback loop, as then it is harder to get people to like you

Hoplessness runs along with it as well. 

Despair, Anxiety, Stress all come as a result of loneliness, hopelessness

I think the underlying principle is great, but at the same time I've always felt that there was just too much unecessary pressure and anxiety associated with it. I recently stumbled across a post in /r/seduction that really spelled it out. The sentence has changed my life (not radically - but we'll get to that). The phrase in question was this:

&gt;**BE** the person you want to be.

In other words, **practice being the person you want to be**. This, of course, is the underlying principle of ""fake it until you make it"" but I often think the message/purpose of that phrase is lost on people. Hell, it was lost on me for 28 years! ""Fake it until you make it"" also implies that you have to make some radical change and it assumes you already *know* how to act the way you want. This isn't the case and we've heard it all before: gradual and sustained changes are far more effective than a radical change that doesn't take root. 

Whenever I'm interacting with people now, I have this constantly in my mind: ""How can I use this situation to practice being the person I want to be?"" If the person I want to be is more assertive, then I try to be just a bit more assertive than usual. If I want to be a good conversationalist, I'll take a deep breath and try to engage the conversation fully (I'm not always successful, but I have improved a lot!). Take every situation and use it as an opportunity. 

So where does this leave us? Well, there's a few things: 

1. Take every opportunity to practice doing what the person you want to be would do. 

2. Recognize that making positive changes takes time. You don't have to change over night. We're all ""works in progress"", afterall. That's the point of practicing. We practice to improve. If you want to be an amazing guitarist, do you sit there and just wish you could play guitar? Or do you pick up a guitar and start practicing? A guitar prodigy only becomes a prodigy if they pick up a guitar.  Some people are natural socializers, for others (like myself) it takes practice. A lot of practice. 

3. Drop the ego. If you're afraid that if you do this you'll turn into this shallow person with a false-identity and fake personality, there's really nothing to worry about. Honestly. If you're afraid of change, I've got news for you. You're a different person now than you were 5 seconds ago. You're a radically different person than you were 5 years ago. And you're completely different person now than when you were 5 years old. Change is inevitable. Embrace it.

4. If you use every interaction as an opportunity, it shifts your mindset away from a negative outlook to a positive outlook. Rather than dreading every. single. social. interaction. you can sit there and say ""I can use this chance to improve myself"". Do it enough times and you'll eventually be looking forward to interacting because you'll see it as an opportunity!

Hope this helps.

Our relationship ended because of another guy, but I'll get to it later.


In our recent little chats, my ex told me that even though she has a boyfriend, whom she has a good relationship with, she's been feeling unhappy about her life.
That unhappiness started to fade away since the day we started talking again.

***""I always have a good time when talking to you. In a way that doesn't happen with others""***, she says.

During our relationship, she used to tell me how special I was, and hearing such things again made me feel appreciated, thus happy...

But then, yesterday, she said something that seriously got me thinking about how she's been unconsciously playing with myself the whole time, even during our relationship.


***""I'm feeling happy now that you're in my life again...
I realized your're my ""batcave"".***

***You're a place of repair from my demons. You know how to heal my wounds, and I feel safe when I am with you.
When I'm with you, I can stop being ""batman"" and reveal my intimate self that only you know.
Even after all this time, even after our breakup, I feel this way about you. You're my batcave, you've always been.""***

It was thanks to this sentence that reality slapped my face.

It made me remember the moments of our relationship when she said such touching things: they were all BAD moments. Moments of crisis that she went through thanks to my love and aid.

The point is that I have no memory of her wanting my love during happy moments, and that's because I was only her batcave. No one would like to spend his good moments inside a cave, am I right?

She'd rather spend her good times with her friends instead of me, I was only needed when she felt sad or depressed, and that is the reason she ended up leaving me for another guy.

What I want to say with this sad story is:

**Don't accept to be treated as a batcave only, you're more than that: you're a person**. 

**The ones who don't understand such thing do not deserve your loving, nor your friendship.**

My whole life I've been really shy. I hated it. I couldn't make phone calls. My family would be mad at me because I'd never talk to them. I would lose friends because I wouldn't make the effort to contact them. My work life suffered. If I saw an old friend at the mall I would hide. But I thought ""that's just the way I am."" 

But a few things happened in my life that showed me that I don't have to be like that if I don't want to. 

1. On my 28th Birthday, a friend gave me some mdma (Ecstasy).(I'm not recommending drugs here btw.) On it, I loved everyone, wanted to talk and touch everyone. I was the life of the party, a social butterfly. I wanted to be like that every day. 

2. Psychology. I've always loved social sciences, and it's proven that phobias are treatable. And that's what I had, an irrational fear of humans. :) (Mixed with low confidence)

3. Reddit. There's a lot of self-help subreddits that helped me. /r/getmotivated, /r/socialskills, /r/faimprovement , /r/dating_advice. Over the years I've seen so many success stories from people who have come such a long way. It really shows you that changing yourself is possible. 

4. I learned to dance. This is like a booster shot of liquid self-esteem. When you're able to just flail your arms and shake your booty without a care in the world as to what other people think about it. It's really freeing. 

So in the last two years, I've been on a mission to rid myself of my shyness. It's not completely gone, but I'm more than halfway there, and I've never been happier. It's fucking hard work, but omg is it worth it. 

Things I do to practice. 

- Look people in the eye when I talk to them. Always terrifying to me before, but gets easier pretty quickly. 

- Smile. It's cliché, but it has lots of positive effects. It makes your brain think you're happy, so it releases dopamine. People think you're friendly so they're more likely to talk to you. 

- Talk to All The People! Make small talk, then ask open-ended questions. Asking open ended questions is what makes a real connection with others possible. It allows you to really get to know someone. 

- Allow yourself to love yourself. Say supportive and positive things in your mind, or even out loud. Things like ""You're awesome!"", ""I'm the Boss!"", and things like that. [Self Fulfilling Prophecies work.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy) (Just don't become arrogant, you will if you take it too far.)

- Start liking people more. I used think I hated people. But I think that was just my brain making excuses because it was afraid of them. I saw a quote from Niel Gaiman that really resonated with me.

&gt;""Everyone has a secret world inside of them. All the people in the whole world, no matter how dull they seem on the outside, inside them they've got unimaginable, magnificent, wonderful, stupid, amazing worlds.""

I now think that every single person, has at least one thing that they have in common with someone else.

Back before my transformation, I wasn’t outgoing or social. When I met someone new or interacted with someone I was uncomfortable around, I completely shut down. [This was me](http://i.imgur.com/geCseyf.png). I was scared to be myself so I kept to myself. People sat down to talk to me, but I gave them nothing to work with and they lost interest. When someone said hello, I murmured and looked down at the ground. It was impossible to make friends that way. It sucked.

Since then, my social life has done a complete 180. I am no longer afraid to be myself around new people. I find it easy to say hello to strangers and I can easily spark up a conversation with anyone. My immediate friend group has practically quadrupled. Most of all, I feel comfortable being myself around new people, and now I make friends very easily.

How did I accomplish this amazing feat, you ask? Well, it all came down to one idea:

Fake it ‘til you make it.

If you’re anything like I was, you know of FITYMI, but you don’t know how to FITYMI. Well, it all boils down to this: pretend that you’re confident and pretend that you don’t care about what other people think. Just pretend. You probably do care about what people think, but pretend that you don’t. Act as if you have complete confidence in yourself and your abilities, even if you feel the opposite. **It will do wonders for you**.

Here is what I did:

First, I started smiling at people as I walked down the street. I wasn’t ready to talk to strangers or anything, but I knew I needed to start somewhere. So, on my commute to school, I looked people in the eye and had a slight smile on my face. I didn’t feel like smiling at all, but I faked it. I was scared of how those strangers would judge me, but I pretended that I didn’t care. I felt awkward inside, but I looked incredibly confident outside. Some looked back and smiled, most looked sheepishly at the ground. Day by day, I started feeling better about it. By the second week, I barely had to pretend at all. It became easy.

I felt great, so I decided to FITYMI at school. I started by saying hello to everybody I knew by name. At first, I felt awkward inside, but I pretended that I didn’t. I also started chatting with people I didn’t really know. For example, if I saw someone wearing cool headphones or a new jacket, I made a comment. It’s amazing how little it takes to start a conversation! I quickly learned that **it didn't matter what I said as long as I said it with absolute confidence**. I was worried about what these people thought of me, *but they didn’t know that*. To them, it looked like I was in complete control. 

I also decided to try my FITYMI technique in public. I did little things at first, like asking for the time at the bus stop, but before long I was doing big things. If someone was playing their DS on the subway, I asked them what games they liked. If someone had a large travel backpack on the bus, I asked them where they were going. I said anything that came to mind, but I said it with absolute confidence. I was amazed at how easy it was. 

In just two months of FITYMI, my friend circle exploded. At school, I felt comfortable talking to anyone. Talking to girls became easy, and flirting became fun. I even made friends with my bus driver and the regulars on my morning commute. Best of all, I felt great about myself.

Now, here’s the beauty of FITYMI: it becomes a habit. When you walk and talk with confidence everyday, even if you’re only pretending, it becomes the norm. They say that the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, but what they don’t tell you is that habit takes over after mile 20. It becomes incredibly easy! If you have the courage to put yourself out there, the world will reward you for it.

If youre to lazy to click on the link, here is the context

[Original comment] 

&gt;I was not aware that telling a related ""me too"" story is considered rude/self centered.
I keep coming across people who say ""I had no idea I was being a douche bag when someone would tell a story about (subject) and then once they were done I would say oh yeah one time I (subject).""
I just thought that's how conversations worked...
So... I guess I'm that guy who tells a story after you tell a story.

[Reply]

&gt;Sometimes. If it's done a lot, it takes away from the first person's story. A good way to combat the awkward is to talk about the other person's story first, then give a very short outline or remark about how you can relate.

Example:

&gt;Guy 1: ""Check this shit out. I went to Vegas and ...blah blah blah blah blah blah for 7 minutes. ...That's why I vow to stay away from Vegas strippers from now on!""

&gt;You: ""Damn, dude, that sounds ridiculous. How did you recover?""

&gt;Guy 1: Blah blah blah

&gt;You: ""Oh, shit, blah blah blah.""

&gt;Guy 1: ""Yeah, I know.""

&gt;You: ""All those strippers are crazy. Hell, when I was there, one of them tried to steal my damned wallet.""

&gt;And let it go on naturally from there. Everyone wants their story to be acknowledged. So, don't worry about getting your piece in right away. Talk to them about their story, then try and show them that you relate after.

1351639820.0,269,self.socialskills,12d8r5,A practical guide to being more assertive...,,320,51,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/12d8r5/a_practical_guide_to_being_more_assertive/,"Here is a practical guide that may help in becoming more assertive. I wrote it in simple steps. It's based on personal experience so take what you can from here:

1.) Start by not-giving-a-fuck what other people think: This is a very important step. It's the foundation to being more assertive. You necessarily have to start from here. Basically, it consists in going to social situations and internalizing the following mantra: ""I don't care what people here think of me"". This includes your physical appearance, what you're wearing, who you're talking to, how you talk, and even how you move. If you feel people are looking or staring at you, disregard them. Completely. Once you feel that you really don't care what people are thinking of you in most social situations, you're ready for the next step. 

How do you know you've stopped caring? When you know that a person is judging you and you really don't give a damn...

2.) Learn to identify your true desires: This one is really hard. Many times, our egos are so in ""survival mode"", that they negate our own desires by making ourselves believe that we are ""over"" or ""above"" such things. One example of this could be: ""I won't fight for that girl because a girl that deserves me will automatically see that I'm better and will not pay attention to the other douche bag cock-blocking me"". 
This is just our ego making us go in a self-defeating behavior. Although it's very important, it's easier said than done.

One technique I use is the following: Has it ever happened to you that you find yourself in a social situation where you feel a hole in your stomach? Like a feeling that, something isn't right here? Well...this is your true self telling you: SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT HERE.

Listen to it! Something isn't right because your desire is being denied by a social situation (usually someone). This is the moment to stop, breathe deeply and think: ""What exactly is happening here that I don't like"". One example could be: ""I've been standing in line and this guy suddenly cuts in front of me. I find this unfair. I was here first and this guy should respect me and my time"". This last bit is your desire for being respected. It can happen with any type of situation. You just have to be an observer of your feelings and reactions. Once you find that you can identify your true desires without doubts (I really like this girl and I want her to be with me, this guy is disrespecting me and I want him to stop), your ready for the next step.

3.) Aknowledge and accept these desires: This part is very important. It's also kind of tricky. Why? Well, if you achieve the previous step, you'll notice that sometimes your desires may be ""I want to have the car that that guy has"" or ""I want to be the boss"" or ""I want to take that girl/boy from his/her SO""...so, maybe you start seeing that your desires may not be so nice and may make you seem like not such a nice person after all...well, it's important to know that desires come from our evolutionary drives. This include our sexual and aggressive drives, which are common in EVERY HUMAN BEING. Now, that said, being assertive is not becoming a murder/rapist, just because your desires took you that way (this will be cleared up in the next step.) 

For now, let's concentrate on this very important mantra: ""I aknowledge and accept ALL my desires as part of me, WITHOUT JUDGING MYSELF"". I cannot stress the importance of the last part. I'll illustrate it with an example:

You meet a very nice, beautiful girl and start chatting and find that there might be chemistry between you. Suddenly, her boyfriend/husband arrives with their two children. She introduces him to you and, although you manage to force a smile, you feel this hole in the stomach. Since you already know how to identify your desires, you know that you desire him out of the picture in order to have her. Suddenly, you feel bad about yourself. ""i'm not this type of douchebag!"" You say to yourself. So you repress your desire. THIS IS WRONG. 

What you should do, is identify the desire, and then say to yourself: ""I acknowledge and accept this desire as a part of me."" END. No: ""but I'm not really like this""  or ""I accept that I'm bad""...no labels, no judging. Once you find that you can do this, go to the next step.

4.) Consciously filter out which desires you will NOT act on: Remember when I said that accepting your desires as a part of you didn't mean allowing yourself to embark on a murder/rape rampage? Well, here is where you deal with the good old 'good vs. wrong'. 

When you already know and assimilate your desire as your own, you have to decide if you're going to act on it. This is very personal, but first of all I would ask myself if the action I propose to execute in anyway violates my principles, hurts others or is even against the law. Like I said, this is very personal. However, this is where you should let the rational, adult, intelligent and 'good person' you take a decision. 

One hugely important thing about this step is that you have to make a compromise with yourself: the consequences of acting in order to fulfill this desire are your SOLE RESPONSIBILITY. Here is where douchebags are seperated from great guys. Here is where boys are separated from men.

5.) Decide which desires YOU ARE going to act upon: This is the core of the process. This is the actual Assertiveness. When you know that your desire doesn't violate your principles, you need to decide if you're going to act on it. This is where the sneaky ego jumps in and starts filling you with self-doubts: ""Is she really worth it? Wouldn't it be better if I just let it pass?""...

This is where you respond: ""I DESERVE WHAT I WANT AND NO ONE IS GOING TO GIVE IT TO ME. I WILL GET IT FOR MYSELF"". Really drill this into your head and heart. Do you want to be respected? Well, you deserve to be and nobody is going to do give it to you for free. Do you want that promotion? Well, you deserve it and they're not just going to give it to you for free...really take the decision that you're going to have that desire fulfilled. Why? Because you deserve it. And nobody is going to do it for you. Once you really decide to go forward with it, go to the next step.

6.) How?: This is where you have to consciously ask yourself, ""What do I need to get what I want?"". The best idea is to think coldly in this step; the emotions already showed you want you want, now it's time for the 'higher brain' to work its part.

All you really have to do is to analyze what you have going for you and what you lack. Then, use what you have and acquire what you lack. 

An example: ""I'm sick of my neighbor playing loud music at 2 am. I want my sleep. I'm decide that I'm going to talk to my neighbor so he stops playing loud music at 2 am. How? Well, my neighbor can sometimes be a real dick. I will have to somehow persuade him. What do I have? I have good manners. What do I lack? I tend to get nervous with these situations. Therefore, before I go talk to him, I'll make sure that I'm completely calm (maybe I'll throw in some meditation). Then, I'll go ring his bell and very politely, but calmly and confidently (I absolutely know that I deserve to have my sleep at 2am), I will ask him to stop playing music at 2am"".

When planning your course of action, it's very important to keep in mind the difference between agressivenes and assertiveness. Assertiveness, as defined by wikipedia: 

a form of behavior characterized by a confident declaration or affirmation of a statement without need of proof; this affirms the person's rights or point of view without either aggressively threatening the rights of another (assuming a position of dominance) or submissively permitting another to ignore or deny one's rights or point of view.

This means that the 'politely' and 'confidently' elements of the example are very important. The difference between becoming an assertive gentleman or an agressive douche depends on this point. So yeah, keep it in mind. 
After you know how you're going to proceed, it's time for the moneyshot...

7.) ACT: Don't think. Don't waste time. ACT. IF you find that your thoughts keep you from acting, start moving one foot towards the girl. Then the other. Then another until you're in front of her and it's too late to back down. Ring the doorbell. Knock on the office door. Pass the point of no return. Even if you're mind is going a million a minute, keep on acting. You may even feel like you're in auto-pilot. Keep on going. The result doesn't matter. This is where the glory is. You're actually taking things in your own hands. You didn't feel good abouit something. You know why. And you decided to accept it and act on it. Now you're doing it. You're BEING ASSERTIVE.

8.) This final step, although kind of an epilogue, is very important. Whatever the outcome was: Let it go. Yoy got what you wanted? Normal, you deserved it. You didn't? Who cares. There are plenty of fish in the sea. DON'T GET ATTACHED.


Finally, I know this is quite a long process to complete in that painfully short 'few second window' you get to act. But, if you start practicing each of these steps, one by one, you'll make this process automatic and instantaneous. In a short time, you'll see that protecting your rights is your nature, not being a doormat. I hope this helps.

Cheers!

Anyways, I thought that maybe a story-type example can assist in the illustration of this check-list. Before, I would like to ask you to please include any step you find missing or that you think can be improved in the comments.

I couldn't handle judgement.

So, I decided to be someone no one could judge by not doing anything.

But of course, you can only not have an opinion of something that doesn't exist.

That started to become appealing.

Now, after meds and therapy, I am starting to realize how much I was worrying over nothing. 

I am a starving artist, and I just posted some stuff.

No one is liking it, and you know what It doesn't matter.

I'm still gunna try and get better.

I feel the old me wanting encouragement, but once you live long enough you realize that it can only take you so far.

I have had more than enough in life already despite the years of me thinking I had none.

So when you talk and don't get a response or even get a negative one.

Just brush it off because as humans we have better thing to give a fuck about. 

It's like getting downvoted.

I started in a few steps in the last years of highschool 

What got me started is having a friend who reminded me that I'm awesome and Im worth being known.

And I progressed on my own from there. 

I started hugging or putting my hand on somebody's shoulder in the halls, strangers, teachers, didn't matter  but I did stop if they were bothered.  Now I'm not bothered at all by having people in my personal space.

Next I started saying hi to people and listening to conversations. Again it didn't matter who, I just got into the habit of asking people how they were, which Gets you A lot of respect in social circles regardless. This got me used to dealing with different social groups, and people with all sorts of interests.

Then I realized I had a thing for comedy, so I would listen in to these conversations and think constantly of what I could say to make people laugh. I got so good at it that I can just look at a select few people and make them spew their drinks.

I soon realized that two huge parts of conversation are body language and vocal inflection.

So I started playing around with my facial expressions and voice in front of a mirror. Just seeing what kinds of emotions I could convey. 

I started moving around and practicing walking different ways. My best two tips here are act curious look at everything and walk as if nobody can stop you.

I've been trying to improve myself for a while now but I've found this mindset to be a huge hindrance -- I get to thinking how pathetic it is that I'm unable to cope with even regular day-to-day things like talking to people, and that I'll never get there because I'm so far behind.

For the past 6 months, I've been forcing myself to go to lots of events, such as happy hours with coworkers and Meetups with strangers. Here are some tips that have worked for me.

1. You need to learn to speak up. If you're socializing in a group, and you can't project your voice loud enough for people to hear, they will become frustrated and stop asking you to repeat yourself. Instead they'll begin to shut you out altogether. I learned to project my voice by reading news articles out loud at home for about half an hour each day, and would recommend it for anyone who has trouble being heard. I also joined Toastmasters, which is also helpful.

2. If you're at an event that's specifically designed for people to mingle and socialize, don't be afraid to walk up to people and join their conversations. Chances are, if they're decent, normal folks, they will let you into their circle, or at least they won't outright reject you. Don't over-think it.

3. Introduce yourself as soon as possible. It's a lot more awkward to introduce yourself to someone you've been sitting next to for 5+ minutes. If possible, as soon as you sit down, go in for a handshake and exchange names.

4. If you're in a 3-way conversation, and you notice the other two people increasingly talking to each other and not giving you a chance to contribute to the conversation, it's time to leave and go to a different group.

5. If you're in a group of 4-5 or more, and you find yourself not contributing a lot to the conversation (whether because you're shy, not talkative, or don't know/care about the topic), DON'T sit back and play on your phone! Make an effort to at least pretend to be interested and involved in the conversation. Simple things you can do to make sure people are still aware of your presence: lean forward, look at the person who's speaking, react to what he/she's saying by laughing or saying things like ""nice"" or ""awesome"", etc.

6. If you don't know a lot about the topic that's being discussed, or find it tedious, wait until the next time the conversation dies down, and start a new topic. Example: ""do you guys know of any good ___ places in the area?"" (Lame example, I know, but these things tend to vary depending on the context.) If the conversation doesn't die down any time soon, try to engage yourself in it by asking questions. ""What is ___? How long have you been doing it?""

7. I've noticed that the person who always tends to dominate the conversation in groups (and who attracts and engages listeners) is the person who can tell the most interesting story. They've traveled widely, or they know the area really well, or they have a unique life experience, and they are eager and confident to share their stories with others. So you might start thinking about how you can add more cool and interesting experiences to your life, so that when you talk about yourself, other people will want to listen.

8. Don't ever go to an event telling yourself ""I need to make at least one new friend tonight."" Instead, tell yourself ""I need to talk to at least x people tonight."" View each interaction as just another chance for you to practice your social skills. If you mess up, no big deal. One, the other person probably doesn't care, and two, you'd probably never see them again anyway.

The subreddit has been seeing a lot of new activity recently, and that's great. If you are a newcomer, you are welcome here, and we're glad to have you :)

I wanted to make a quick note about all of the ""Girl help"" posts I've been seeing that relate to dating and so forth. These posts are not bad, but they are not what I want /r/socialskills to become.

Essentially, we have a lot of good dating-themed subreddits already, and reddit does not really need another one. In contrast, I think /r/socialskills is unique, and it would be a shame to lose it. /r/socialskills is a place on reddit where people can work at getting better at their social skills and their friendships. I think that's really valuable, and so I want to protect that.

At this point, I'm not going to ban ""girl help"" posts. In moderation, they're fine. I just don't want them to become the major theme of the subreddit. However, I would strongly encourage you to **consider posting them in a reddit more dating focused (ie, /r/dating_advice).** Not only will you likely get better advice there, but this allows /r/socialskills to be more focused on social skills fundamentals (conversation, listening skills, making friends, etc.)

If the number of girl help posts goes down to a reasonable level, then we'll leave this as a soft guideline. If we start to get overwhelmed with content that would be more suitable for /r/dating_advice, then I might take the step of starting to ban those posts, and recommending their authors resubmit them in a better subreddit.

Of course, I'm open to your advice and feedback.

I had a good group of friends that I had since middle school, but they were much more confident and outgoing than I was. This led me to having a not-so-good experience in high school. I never went to prom because I was too shy to find a date. I was never invited to parties because I didn't have much to say. I never got laid because I got in my head and would not allow myself to make new friends. Sure, it was fun playing video games with my guy friends, or hanging out casually with a mixed group, but I just found it difficult for some reason to make new friends and get along socially in high school. I was determined to reinvent myself in college. I scoured the internet and obsessively posted on Reddit to try to get advice in order to make this possible.

Eventually, I obtained a nice little pile of info to bring with me to college. After a ton of thinking and personal reflection, I tried each of these things out. Within my first year of college, I had more friends than I could count (both guys and girls), became sexually active, and had more fun than I could imagine. In this thread, I want to try and communicate some of my ideas about Freshman year of college and hopefully help you guys out. If you need any more help whatsoever, I'm more than happy to answer any PMs!

*Mental Prep*

* Psych yourself up! You're entering the next phase of your life! Chances are, you're leaving sometime in the morning. Take a shower, eat a good breakfast, put on your favorite clothes, brush your teeth, and take a deep breath. **Looking your best will instill confidence!**

* If I were to choose the most important piece of advice in this thread it's that NO ONE will know or care who you were in high school. Why this is good for you and bad for cocky extroverts - Let's say we have a star varsity lacrosse starter who had a great high school experience: tons of friends, wild parties, getting laid by the hottest girls. This kid may think that this will continue right where he left off once he gets to college. Heh. Nope. People will see right through his bullshit and write him off as a cocky bag of douche. Let's say you had none of that in high school. Good news! People will see you as genuine! They will know that you're not viewing school as a conquest, but rather an opportunity to make meaningful connections. Therefore, **leave your high school self back home**.

*Roommate(s) and Your Dorm Floor*

* First thing you'll do is obviously meet your roommate. **It does not matter whether or not you like your roommate**. In fact, there are many upsides and downsides to having a good or bad roommate. I had a great roommate my freshman year. We would have deep conversations, laugh about crazy shit, and stay up till the AM watching stupid TV shows, get drunk, and go out on the town together. I smoked weed with him for the first time. I sexiled him the night I lost my virginity, and he cheered when he came back in the room. If you and your roommate are close, you'll probably form your own social circle and bring people in. On the other hand, you could have a bad roommate like my high school friend. He was rude, inconsiderate, and never left the room. However, this was a blessing in disguise. My friend explored other options. Eventually, he joined a fraternity and couldn't be happier. Bad roommates will force you outside of your comfort zone and will make it easier to make friends elsewhere ""Ugh, fuck my roommate. Can I hang with you guys?"" is a perfect ""excuse"" to meet new people in your hall!

* After you meet your roommate, take a deep breath and force yourself to go door-to-door in the hall, meeting new people. I was nervous as shit when I tried this, but I got fantastic results. I even made one of my best friends to date this way. The truth is that **people are nervous when it comes to move-in day. If you break the ice, you'll have a very easy time meeting new friends**. Even if you aren't a good conversationalist, they're more than happy to answer surface-level questions like ""where are you from?"" or ""what did you do in high school?"" or ""what's your major?"" From there, you can just probe their responses. Boom! Conversation!

* **Consider bringing alcohol, but hide it well and be very very fucking careful**. Everyone likes to loosen up when they get there. Casual drinking is a perfect first night activity. Everyone wants to get to know the guy who brings the handle. Just don't let the RA catch you. That would be a shitty way to start the year.

* After the first day, **keep your door WIDE open whenever you are in the room**. I've made friends by simply keeping the door open while I was winding down on Reddit or something.

* **Study with your dorm floor**. Sit with your hallmates in lecture. They won't think it's weird. They want to get to know you. Even if you are terrified of groups, this is a no social pressure situation. Do homework together!

*Clubs, Greek, Etc.*

* This widely varies from school to school. Best way to go about this is to have someone else come with you, especially if you tend to feel socially anxious. This situation is different from your dorm hall because people there already have solid friendships

* **If you feel up to it, go Greek and rush fraternities/sororities**. I highly recommend it. I've gotten much more social as a result of it. It's like your social life, community service, and parties all rolled into one convenient package. People say going Greek is like ""paying for your friends"". To that, I say fuck you. They will not like you because you pay them. That money is used for putting on fun events with your brothers/sisters, as well as community service. Brother/Sisterhoodhood always comes first in Greek organizations. Contrary to popular belief, you can be an introvert and join a solid fraternity. You just need to find the right one that you fit well with.

I was an introvert, limited friends, barely noticed anywhere, bad at connecting with people. 

It worked out in highschool where it prevented you from getting pummeled to the ground but in college... it really makes you feel alone.




       The plan:



First off, I needed a test example. Interestingly one of my friends I sat next to was extremely social. I have never seen someone this good with people, never. I assumed he must of did something or read some psychology books because he was really that good.  He wasn't any different than most of the guys in class, yet he connected with everyone.

Every day he had someone new he was talking to. I assumed it was for the girls, since he mostly talked to them but my goodness was he good. Every single day, someone new. I felt bad for the girls since I knew him and saw how many girls he had in his hand. 

I couldn't understand it though, what exactly was he doing?? Kinda even confused me as to how did we even become friends??

    ""He was good... very good.."" I thought.

After some thinking I came to the realization as to why everyone was so attached to him, why he was such a social butterfly. 

- He didn't lack self confidence
- Always introduced himself.. some how
- Didn't fear social rejection ( i.e. silent treatment, ignored)
- No possible way to hurt his feelings
- Always relaxed
- Didn't seem like he had any negative motives against you
- People felt safe and relaxed around him
- Always had to say something

But an important level to his success was he had no insecurities. Nothing he was negative about himself. He was someone relaxing to be around and girls and guy loved him for that.


    The experiment:



I wanted to try my experiment at a different class. I entered a new class, interestingly a ping pong class where everyone was instructed to introduce themselves. Each table had two players and with tables being switched every 15 minutes. I thought, ""this is the perfect place to test my experiment and hypothesis""

*Will showing no insecurities, be the first to introduce yourself, give eye contact, and always have a positive smile result me in success?*

Everyone I met I smiled and introduced myself, didn't get as much enthusiasm but I didn't stop. Had something to say, anything on my mind. Told jokes, no matter how bad it was. Got a couple chuckles, even made a guy who was stone serious since the first day brake into a smile and laughter.

But yet everyone was still insecure as the first day, of themselves and others. Barely gave much eye contact. Girls were no better, one didn't even look at me and just looked at the ground. I felt horrible on that one, I just wanted to make her feel happier. But I enlisted so much insecurities she was unable to talk to me face to face.

Sometimes people joined their own groups and kinda left me alone at times, yet I still was enthusiastic and someone always came to play.

It was discouraging at first because this whole thing felt unnatural and odd, yet I continued and I'm happy to say things have changed. It's almost like night a day. Nothing like my social butterfly friend but it was something.


    Result  



People were more relaxed towards me all around. They were hesitant, probably sensed I still had deep insecurities which made them a bit more insecure themselves.  

But it did result in one girl being extremely excited to see me after class and a guy causally having a conversation with me just because I introduced myself earlier in class. You might think, omg how is that much of a result but I assure you, when your a social block like I am these things seem big.  

I felt though I was nothing like my friend I mentioned before. What took me 3 months to achieve took him the first week of class.


    Problems encountered



Conversations were nearly impossible to start. I had no real reason to start a conversation and people were not willing to start anything themselves. They sure seemed to like me but it resulted in not many connections.

People had their own insecurities and as a result built up many walls against me. I wasn't able to break down the walls people put up like my friend I mentioned.

People didn't really stick with me, unlike my friend who always had someone with him or even going to him when they see him. 

So yeah...

    Where to go from here..



New year, new classes, many more opportunity to fix my piss poor social skills. But I think other than buffing out the main issues, I still have a hard time getting to the deeper issues of having the trust with people. 

Making that good first impression and connection is still yet near impossible.

This post is about how to make that connection in the first place.  

Also, apparently I can't count and this is only three tips.  Whatevs.  

**Small steps**  

Rome wasn't built in a day.  What is your goal?  I'm guessing it's something like ""have friends who treat me well and want to hang out with me"".  There are a lot of small steps between here and there, so break it down into the smallest steps you can imagine and work on them one at a time.  In this case an appropriately small first step might be something like ""say 'hello' to one stranger"" or ""spend time at the college campus"".  
The steps may seem ludicrously small, but the changes have a way of snowballing on you that is quite surprising.  
And even if they never snowball, ask yourself which is worse: to do a little bit of work each day, or to set large goals that you never get around to?  A little bit of something, or a lot of nothing?  

**Non-neediness**  

I've heard it said that to receive a loan you have to convince the bank that you don't need the money.  The same thing occurs with social interactions: you can't seem needy or desperate for social interaction, or people will get a creepy vibe from you.  Trust me, I'm speaking from bitter experience here.  =/  

This can be a problem, because the lonelier you feel, the easier it is to act needy.  

The antidote to this is self-validation.  Be happy with yourself and who you are.  By all means, you should do your best to improve your situation, but make sure your first priority is being whole and grounded by yourself before you attempt to bring anybody else into the mix.  

Pay attention to the feedback you get from other people to adjust your behavior, but never make your goal be a specific ""good"" response from another person.  Focus instead on improving your behavior, and let other peoples' reactions indicate how much your social behavior has improved.  
The difference between the two is that one puts the focus on other people's behavior, which you have no control over, and the other puts the focus on your behavior, which is far more controllable.  

**Cold approaches**  

Cold approaching refers to greeting somebody you've never met before and striking up a conversation with them.  The cool part about cold approaching is that literally *everybody you see* is a potential friend, and even if you screw up horribly, you can just walk five feet and you will never have to deal with them again.  

The downside is that it can be a very intense experience, roughly akin to going on-stage for the first time.  
""Small steps"" help with this **a lot**, by setting goals so small they sneak around the brain's ""fight-or-flight"" mechanism.  

A good goal for the first day might be ""say 'hello' to a stranger"" or ""ask for the time"" if you need the pretext (there's nothing wrong if you do).  

Then, once you get comfortable doing that a few times (spread over several days or even weeks if that's necessary), you can progress to [free-associating, telling short stories, and asking open-ended questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1ccn0p/four_tips_to_drastically_improve_your_socializing/).  

From there you can create activities to invite other people to, but that's getting a bit ahead of ourselves here.  For now, just focus on cold approaching.

1366811271.0,204,self.socialskills,1d0bkv,[UPDATE] I'm so awkward and never know what to talk about when meeting new people,socialanxieties,240,36,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1d0bkv/update_im_so_awkward_and_never_know_what_to_talk/,"Hi everyone!

This is an update [to a post I made yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1cxskx/im_so_awkward_and_never_know_what_to_talk_about/)

Long story short, I had a meeting with someone I met online, in a city I barely knew, and I just didn't know what to talk about or how to act since it had been so long that I had actually been social or hung out with friends. Here is how the night went...


I was so anxious and nervous on the drive there, and actually ended up getting really lost and I felt so bad because she was already there and waiting. I was so flustered that I ended up driving around in circles looking for the place and for parking that I didn't realize I was already 15 minutes late.

I tried to just focus on being positive and not letting this small hiccup bring me down, and finally called her. She found me after 5 minutes of me trying to guide her to me since I didn't know the city at all... I was sitting in my car in the middle of a parking garage just trying to calm my nerves because I felt like things were starting to go wrong!

The first time seeing each other was her opening the passenger car door and coming in. I couldn't seem to find the area in the parking garage where you park (the first floor was all private parking) but she guided me to the public parking area on the second floor (yay!)

We started walking towards the city center, and as expected, it was a little awkward at first. As the minutes passed on, though, I realized that talking about things wasn't as hard as I originally thought it was. I brought up topics like talking about Sweden, how she likes it here, what she likes to do around the city...

She also asked me a few questions about my time here in the city (though she seemed almost as nervous as I was! I felt like that calmed my nerves a little...I wasn't alone in this!) and tried to answer as best as I could.

We found a cafe and ended up sitting down and drinking some coffee (I was surprised and glad in a way that this place was open so late because it gave us more to talk about... good drinks, which led to good bars around here, which lead to her talking about how she likes going out with friends on the weekends here)

I then sheepishly admitted that I'd been here for a while but hadn't made any friends because I just didn't know how to meet people and she suggested that we go out on Friday night so she can show me around the city and meet her friends!!! :)

After I heard that, I became way more confident knowing that she thought I was somebody she would want to see again, and that she would even introduce me to her friends!!

An hour passed by and things started becoming much easier to talk about (she did have an alcoholic drink..not sure if it maybe opened her up more? She seemed more at ease and I was happy for that!)

With /u/manotm 's response, I suggested we walk around after the cafe. We walked through the dark, semi-empty streets and just looking around. We talked about the things we passed, we grabbed some ice cream, and my nerves were slowly going away.

I used /u/handlesscombo and /u/undugg 's ""FORD"" acronym, and she talked a lot about herself, her job as an au pair, her friends, what she wants to do after her year of au pairing, and just fun things to do around here. It turns out she met a lot of her friends online and that fact made me feel better in some way that I can't describe.

We ended up talking and hanging out for 3 hours and at the end of the night, she was very talkative (I'm still not that talkative of a person so I did a lot of listening :) ) and I didn't really feel nervous at all anymore.

She brought up meeting up on Friday again and that said she'd get in contact with me about it and we said our goodbyes.

I definitely think that getting over my initial nervousness was the hardest part. I still don't think I am a very sociable person, far from it... but this was a huge step in the right direction, and I'm already feeling more confident about the meeting on Friday. I really hope it goes well! Talking to a lot of new people in a group is my next challenge... if anyone has any tips on that please let me know...


Anyways, I just want to say thank you to everyone who responded and for being so positive and helpful. I have found that in many parts of reddit there are people who are quite negative, but I received no negativity and only very helpful advice and words of encouragement here in /r/socialskills. So, thank you so much!! :)

Eliminate all awkward gaps from your small talk!,Yamochao,243,37,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1hm7ld/never_be_at_a_loss_for_a_conversation_topic_again/,"Pick a letter at random (I often use the first letter of their name if I'm having trouble picking one), then think of the first thing that comes into your head. It's a *very* simple thought process, and should only take you half a second, a whole second tops. 

Now usually you'll wind up with something like ""muffin,"" or ""VCR,"" which may not seem immediately relevant or helpful, but it *is.*

See, conversational holes means that for some reason, we've suddenly stopped flowing off of each other's energy and ideas. Someone spaced out, a conclusion on the subject has been reached, whatever. All of a sudden, the brain flips into internal dialogue mode, trying to consciously tailor what to say next. 

Natural small talk is about just talking, and not thinking about it too much. By doing this one second process, you now have a spark to work from. You'd be surprised how naturally ""muffin"" becomes ""Anyways, you have a good breakfast today?"" or ""VCR"" turns into ""Yeah... you know what I saw the other day? Videodrome. Ever seen it?"" 

Even if you wind up with ""What's your favorite kind of muffin?"" or ""Do you still have a VHS collection?"" whatever, you broke the silence, so what if you come across as spontaneous, that's totally amicable. Their response will quickly reignite the momentum. If it doesn't, you can just do it again, the most important thing is that you're just choosing a direction instead of being self-conscious/indecisive and letting the silence grow stronger by the second. 

(Literally) A couple tips:

* Any spark can be formulated as a question. This is easier for them, as it naturally warrants a response, and it is easier for you as questions are usually much simpler.
* Any spark can be made about them. Especially complements. People are most comfortable talking about themselves, it's the subject they know the best. No matter how dumb what you say is, if it's phrased as a compliment, the dumbness will be overlooked in favor of gratitude and narcissism.

Sp for a while now, well, to be honest, a long time now, I have lacked 'proper' social skills, if that is even a thing. Quite literally, just the other day, I had an excursion, and my friend on the way back from it decides to drop this on me and I quote:

'Aw you're borong! Imma sit next to (Other friend)'

If amy of you guys know about /r/howtonotgiveafuck, let's just say, I gave WAAAY too many fucks then. 

Anyway, that was my first indicator that something had to change. Next thing that happened was my inability to keep a conversation going for prolonged amounts of time. Now, sometimes I can; sometimes I can't. The only thing left from this is me being...well, funny. I do have a sense of humour just so you know, but I just can't seem to apply it in conversations.

I'm not completely inept at being social but I'm not a social butterfly either. It was easy enough to make friends or network during college, because everyone was so easy to relate to. But now that I've graduated I'm absolutely petrified of the fact that I am not able to meet new people anymore.

How do you meet new people?

EDIT:

Thanks for some of the great suggestions. Here's a compilation for those seeking advice, like me:

* Get involved in things: take classes (community college), join a club or team, volunteer (lain83)
* Be positive when you meet new people and don't tell them how much you need friends (lain83)
* The key to making friends is frequent, unscheduled interaction in comfortable environments (QuixoticChris)
* http://www.meetup.com (slurpherp)

I decided to write the second part of what now is a two-parter, on how to become a naturally social person, where ever you may be. The store, movies, dinner, or at home. Think about that last thing, *home*. What is home to you? Jot it down now.

When I think of home I think of many things, but this is one that stands out:

* People that know me and vice-versa. 

Who is the person you can be yourself with no matter what you've done or who you are? Most will say their Mom, Dad, Brother, Sister,  best friend, etc. 

**Changing The Way You Feel When Out:**

For instance, for the past several months I've caught onto something I've been doing. While out with friends or running an errand for my Mom, I'd start to feel anxious, my heart starts beating profusely, and I'd stumble and really be cautious of what my next words would be.

When I was growing up &amp; even now my Mom tells me stories about how I'd go up to anyone and just start a conversation out of nowhere with strangers. 

It got me thinking. Now, why could I do this when I was a kid, but now I scares the crap out of me? I found the answer to be quite simple. **I didn't care.** Or, a more accurate answer; I was too young to care. But, it works the same. **I also didn't put people on a pedestal.** There were no rich or poor. When, I was younger, I only knew people. That's it. I put no one above me, all I saw were faces, mouths, ways to communicate.

So the moral and what you should take from that chunk of text; is to **remove people from pedestals.** 

Now, let's take a deeper look into feeling more at home &amp; naturally meeting new people. 

**The Home Effect:** 

Before I go on, this is a developing theory of my own, so forgive me if it is somewhat flawed. It's helped me so I'm passing it along. 

If you remember from above, the part where I rambled about the person you could just be yourself around. Keep them in mind while I further explain. 

The person that I can talk to without feeling nervous, anxious, or scared is my Mom. Why? **Because she knows me, my flaws, and the things I'm good at. I have nothing to hide, so I don't have to prove myself in anyway.**

For some people, it might not be their Mom it could be anyone that you can just *chill* around, like friends. Even if you're live alone, you don't have to hide or prove anything to anyone, because you know yourself.

So one the way you get that *security* feeling of your home while out and about, is to be an open book. I'm not saying to announce to everyone you meet that you're a K-Pop fanatic. **Just assume people know who you are, your every flaw, and what you're good at.** Even though they don't. Just **assume** they do, until the time comes that you want to tell them. Not that you ever have to, of course.

**Closing Thoughts:**

I'm sorry for the wall of text, but I really hope you guys enjoyed it :). It was really fun writing it, and I hope it helps someone.

Remember the next time you're out and feeling out of place:
  
* **Remove people from pedestals, they're just like you and me.**

* **Take risks and don't care, you never know what you can find from a little digging.** Watch [this] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdymCQ5PXrs), it motivated me to take more risks, it's only 2 minutes and it's worth it! 

* **Assume people know you, even if they don't.**

On advice I got here, I just decided to bite the bullet and go out somewhere, anywhere, where it was more socially acceptable to meet new people.  I saw the coffee house I usually go to had an evening event, with an open mic, and decided to head to that.  My goal wasn't to meet women or anything, just make friends, completely platonic.  I haven't really done anything like this, completely on my own, in my life, so it was a bit of a big step for me.

When I got there it was pretty crowded.  Lots of college kids, I felt a bit older, but then there were some even older (30's, 40's) people scattered around as well.  Ordered a beer and didn't really know where to sit.  My first problem is that everyone seemed to be with someone else, either in pairs, or large groups of friends.  There were probably 50 people packed in there overall.  Tried to look for opportunities to go up and talk to people, but every opportunity I saw would have seemed very forced and awkward.

I ended up finding a chair by myself, watching the performances for awhile (some of them were really bad...).  Tried to look open and confident, but there still didn't seem like any way to introduce myself to anyone.  Ended up finishing my beer, and left after about an hour.

I don't know much about social skills, partly because I'm socially awkward myself. But I've been experimenting, and working on my own social skills. The main problem I encountered, was that there was little I knew what to talk about, but forget about that. What matters, is what I learned from this subreddit, that I took for granted. 

**Don't take this for granted!** Don't ignore it, please, this advice has been going around for a long time, and only now did I realize how much truth it spoke. 

The thing is, most people will actually accept whatever you say, as long as you accept it yourself. This is what confidence really is: to show that what you say, is what goes for you. The way I went by this, was by **looking them always in the eyes, so that you show them that you're not afraid**(god, I wish I did this the moment I read this the first time), **by talking slow and clear, to let them understand everything you say, and to let them know clearly that you understand it yourself** (I always talked faster and made the others always say 'what?'), **don't go back on your words, to show that you are a consistent person**.

This is what I have found out for myself to work. Don't worry about the things you say, as long as you are **confident** about them. /r/confidence will go a long way (my trick for a 24 hour confidence boost, is the mirror-talk in the morning).

I seem to be paralyzed by authority be it at the workplace or at school. I find myself thinking too much when conversing with such people, and this impedes the flow of it. Sometimes I can't even think of anything at all, and I freeze and end up saying something stupid which I end up regretting immediately. I admit that thinking on my feet is not one of my strongest fortes. This is something I really want to work at, but I am not sure how. Conversely, I kick myself for not saying the things I ought to say.

Besides that, having normal conversations with say, the occasional taxi driver stops me in my tracks too. I find myself agreeing on topics, unable to express opinions of my own. Not because I don't want to disagree, but there's nothing that comes to mind besides the shallow and patronizing remarks. I end up nodding and smiling along which i hate myself for.

My thoughts seem to be all over the place. If I were to imagine a hypothetical exchange, I have problems even forming coherent sentences on my own. I end up losing focus mid-sentence and my they comes out really complicated (especially at the end of sentences when I want to end it). My brain seems to run too slow for my mouth, analogous to a PC freezing for a few seconds, and then suddenly executing everything at once. This is so bad that I am beginning to question my intelligence, logical reasoning skills and all.

I wonder if it that is the way it is.. Am I to accept that for who I am? My ambition is to work in the hospitality industry, but I don't see myself having the gift of the gab to effectively do that well. It just seems such a pity to have to give it up.

Am I an introvert? I actually don't think so - I love having people around in those occasions where we have things to talk about. But my inability to socialize has forced me to re-assess that. Even with some of my closest friends, it feels as if we have nothing to talk about if I am alone with just another friend. However, when there's a third person (to relieve the pressure so to speak), I have no problems becoming the livewire. I understand that one doesn't always has to keep the conversation going, but I cant help to feel that way. Having silence in the air suffocates me. But I can't hold a conversation well either. I have been reading this subreddit, and I have used tips making them talk about themselves or ask related questions to further the conversation. But I often end up realizing that it sounds like an interrogation. I can't get the spark, that connection with person. I don't have any interests in particular, be it sports or hobbies.

Anyways I'm sorry I'm late on the update.

So I arrived at the party, and as expected there was about 10 girls and 4 guys. Two of the four guys were in relationships. At first it was a bit easy getting to know new people because you can sort of ask the same go to questions to start the small conversations. After awhile I thought things were going to get awkward, but alcohol came to my rescue. 

I listened to you guys and got to an even level of (tipsy-ness?) and I was able to communicate just fine without my anxiety kicking in. I also brought some marijuana with me and smoked out the person I knew along with a few other people at the party I had met. It was just a really good time, nothing crazy. Yeah it was kind of awkward and slow at some points, but it wasn't bad at all. I met a lot of cool people who I probably will be seeing in the future. 

And to think, I was about to stay home and not go because I was too nervous. I wouldn't have met any of those people and I would have never had any of those conversations if it weren't for me choosing to go. Thanks for the encouragement guys/gals. 

I have a long way to go, starting my second year of college this fall! So there will be a lot to learn, but as of now I consider the other night a success.

1367074682.0,163,self.socialskills,1d7uiu,I'm a terrible storyteller.,unto_this_last,184,21,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1d7uiu/im_a_terrible_storyteller/,"Hey,

Last night I discovered that I am a terrible storyteller. Not only that, but I have a hard time remembering anything significant/funny in my life that would make a good story - so I'm not working with the best material, nor do I have the skills to present it in an interesting way. I even have a hard time keeping the facts straight in my head, so I'm all over the place. Really, the point of this is to ask how to working on becoming a good storyteller and how to get some good stories to tell. I am not trying to be the guy that always one ups you at all, just want something to contribute when people are sitting around telling stories about their past...

Last night I was hanging out with two friends of mine (who happen to be going out, but they are both awesome people - their chemistry is sometimes off putting when I realize how bad I'm doing in socializing - I mention this just to say that I do get really self conscious when talking). We were playing pool and I thought I was doing extremely well in socializing with them (compared to past experiences). I was joking around, actively listening, I was fully interested in our interactions. It was a wonderful change. However I did notice something, my entire basis for conversation was what was in front of me at that very moment, living in the present if you will. Talking about the person taking their shot, some random information regarding a cool billiards game I found online, discussing rules of the game, etc. We then went back to their apartment and were just kind of sitting around talking and I felt that I had absolutely nothing to contribute to the conversation. I almost felt like a spectator. I'm sure some of you have had this experience, they stop really looking at you when talking because you're not contributing anything so they slowly stop engaging you with their eyes (I doubt it's a conscious thing they're doing), and then you get even MORE self conscious that you're not saying anything and it's just a big circle of one thing causing the other thing to get worse and just feels like a huge amount of pressure to break the silence with something amazing which adds even more pressure... (no idea how to deal with that...)

They were discussing bad bosses and jobs they've had in the past, bad co workers, injuries they went through when they were younger (potentially broken arms, funny stuff happening around them, etc.) and they both had really refined skills at telling stories. And it's not like they tell the same ones everyday, it was fairly obvious to me that they just were stringing together memories into really funny and interesting narratives that really engaged the listener. It was actually astounding to listen to them speak, it was glaringly obvious to me that they had improved exponentially at storytelling since the last time I saw them (which was about a month ago).

I don't know how to go about doing this... I know watching stand up is a good way of seeing how to put together a story in a way to keep it interesting, but I still find it extremely difficult to relate to people when I haven't really done as much as they have, nor can I relate to them in talking about the things that I've done.

So, those of you who are good at storytelling - or even more specifically, those who used to be absolutely terrible at it and now understand how to go about doing it, what is some advice in keeping up in these situations? 

I want to be clear, I am not looking to be ""one upping"" people's stories. I am just looking to relate to others through storytelling. When people are talking about 'worst experiences', I figure everyone should have one. And when they are going around the room and everyone is contributing something really awesome, I feel really left out and like I don't belong when I can't even think of anything to say, and knowing even if I did I couldn't string it together to be an interesting tale (or even one that makes any sense half the time...)

I dunno, I've always had trouble even getting the events in the right order in my head, and I'll explain it in a strange way that has people asking questions, and I seem to hyperbolize everything as well... which I really tried to avoid here, but reading this I find that I am still not doing well in explaining myself.

1) I'm so lonely I take any kind act as a sign of her liking me.
2) I think way too much and seen way too many movies so I come up with some stupid fantasy where the firl I'm talking to falls in love with me in a matter of seconds.

I know that both of those are extremely unfair to the girl but I don't act on them so it just tears me up inside.

In middle school I had no self control and I never thought before I acted and I must have asked out every girl at my school. Obviously they all said no. Then last Valentine's Day I got the courage to ask out a girl. Our school had carnations that a student could buy and send to another student so I just sent her ""Happy Valentine's Day"". When she came up to say thank you she gave me a hug and then I ask her. Her only response was that she was busy. I'm pretty optimistic so I thought ""maybe she is busy"", so I kept asking her if she was busy the next weekend and the next so me getting the message just said okay and went on with my day.

This took me **sooo** much courage and now I'm scared to talk to any girl now. I can't even have a conversation with my best friend's girlfriend because I'm too scared.

Everyone avoids him, especially the women. I will tell you why:

- He is angry. He speaks in an angry sarcastic tone. He speaks in a lower tone than is natural, to sound older/manly. 
- He complains. He sends unpleasant emails to the whole office complaining about and/or demanding things. 
- He lurks around. He follows people. He stands way too close. People feel like he is watching or observing their comings and goings. 
- He will sneak up behind you while you are working at your desk. 
- He has made mildly racist/homophobic jokes, and has demonstrated anger at strangers in public. 
- He repeatedly and persistently asks people to lunch, despite being turned down for over a year. He then questions them why not, and sounds mildly threatening.
- He does not pick up on typical social cues, such as repeated ""no's"" to invites, avoidance, not making eye contact, leaving the room, moving physically away, turning your body away, etc. 

If I could somehow give advice to this guy, it would be: Be friendly, be professional. Don't speak like a sarcastic teenage - talk like a grownup. Do not make up excuses or fake questions to talk to people. Do not ask people to lunch. Don't stand too close. Work hard, and pay no attention to the comings and goings of those around you. Give people space, and if they do approach you, be friendly and helpful.

Kudos to the social skills sub reddit . Just browsing through some of the content here, its obvious there's lots of good advice and people actively trying to improve. That's so awesome! I wish there was a community like this back when I was really going through my social issues in trying to improve. So I'm definitely looking forward to getting involved here, commenting and making some connections.

Well I'd like to start here by giving back what I can. Just some simple advice that may or may not help people. Its obvious advice, but took me awhile to really understand it.

It's just the idea of persistence and not being down on yourself for not being where you feel you should be. If I learned anything, it's that getting better socially takes time. I think a part of me expected to just search for some advice, read it, and then instantly be able to go out and talk to people better. So I would learn some new technique, go out to try it, chicken out and not do it, then feel horrible about myself because I felt like a failure.

but what I discovered is improving socially doesn't work that way. You don't get better by trying once or even five times. You have to persist and do it over and over again until you get better. Also, its usually best not to bite off more than you can chew in the beginning. So this might mean not trying to go to clubs and bars to improve socially. I found those are actually the worst places to try improving. Same goes for trying to talk to people on the street. It can be done and I'm not saying its bad, but for me that was too hard at first. So taking it slower is usually a better way to go.

I guess my point is, the lesson I learned is that all of this is OK. It's okay not to be good socially but to improve from where you currently are. It's okay to not be as good as the person next to you for now. Its okay for it to take as long as it takes for YOU. But you gotta keep at it. It won't happen overnight. What I learned is you need to treat improving socially just like you would approach losing weight or getting better at any skill.

Anyway, pretty simple concept but something I know I had to hear over and over again to have it really sink in. But to wrap up here, I'll put it in another way through an awesome quote that actually sits on my desk. This way I can see it everyday.

""Do not be impatient with your seemingly slow progress. Do not try to run faster than you presently can. If you are studying, reflecting and trying, you are making progress whether you are aware of it or not. A traveler walking the road in the darkness of night is still going forward. Someday, some way, everything will… break open, like the natural unfolding of a rosebud.""

 - Vernon Howard.

A tip that will only apply to a few of you, but is incredibly important.

One thing that people absolutely hate and I mean Can't stand, eyes roll, teeth clench, never want to spend time with that person again HATE!

Is when after you tell a bad joke, you prod the person on to admitting it was a good one. Sayings like ""Oh come on, that's funny"", ""You know someone had to go there"", ""It's true, that is true right? Right?"" ""It had to be said"" or any other variation which ends with the other person making a forced chuckle and saying, ""uh... year sure"".

Sometimes jokes, quips or burns aren't all that funny. More importantly, sometimes jokes you personally think are funny don't appeal to other people in the same way. Socially adept people let those jokes die on the table and move on. But if you follow a joke by trying to talk up the joke or getting people to admit that it was a good joke, they're probably going to let your friendship die on the table, because NOBODY, likes the guy who gets you to verbally state that their bad joke was funny.

I hope this benefits someone, have a nice night!

Edit: As many have mentioned, Letting the joke die doesn't consist of just staring akwardly in silence. Making a quick quip about the joke being bad can be helpful, or just moving the conversation along.",,False,,t5_2r275,1357646565.0,,,True,t3_165lms,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/165lms/a_tip_about_jokes_from_a_more_socially_skilled/,

I used to be like most of you probably are; introverted against my will, lonely, unable to express myself by talking and generally a bad conversationalist. About three months ago I got a huge motivation boost to try and change myself. Now, I have a girlfriend, friends, a social life and better than average conversational skills. 

Here are some tips that I can offer you who want to change:
___


* Let people love you as who you are

This helped me the most. If you loosen up, and let people love you without caring how they react, you will not only show people who you really are, but will probably be more friendly than you used to be. Without doing this, I would've never gotten the friends I have now. I used to want to be something I'm not. I let myself be myself, and showed who I was to people. I let people love *me* not the person I *wanted to be*. Open up, and people will love you.

* Read about social skills, online and by reading books

This helped me a ton too. Read the sidebar websites, and google a lot about things. Read about things you could talk about with people, or learn how to ask good questions if you like listening more than talking (or just memorize some questions)

* Society puts too much pressure into being socially active

It's completely OK to not have a girl/boyfriend. It's completely OK to be quiet and think. It's OK to be a hermit. But society seems to think something else. Society is stupid for this exact reason. But nobody ever got stronger for just floating with the stream. To get stronger, you have to swim against the stream.

* Accept what you can't change, change what you can't accept.

This was especially important for me. This was on a bathroom wall, and it's gotten stuck to me ever since. Do as it says, and you'll be better off. If you're introverted, then you are. If you can't change this, don't try. If you can, do.

* Try doing what's called ""social skydiving""

Talk to strangers. People who will never meet you again. People on buses, trains, grocery stores and other towns. This will make you a better conversationalist. I **know** this is hard if you are anxious about strangers, but no pain, no gain. Learn to accept the fact that you will be anxious about this. But also remember that you're doing this so that in the future, you won't be anxious when talking to non-strangers.

In social situations, people become more friendly from the first sip, even before the alcohol hits the stomach.

So, not a long ago I've decide to perform an experiment. I sat down under the influence of alcohol and tried to describe to my future sober self what are my exact feelings while being drunk. Afterwards while being sober., I began to replicate my behavior, movement of face muscles, laughter, and more aspects of general feel from being drunk. More specifically, in this order: Smile ; Relax ; invoke Self-Reassurance (i.e. attenuate your self-criticism) ; Seek present Realization (i.e. focus on the moment, not the past or future). In short, I'll dub it the **SRSRSR** method.

That experiment drove me to a discovery - I don't need alcohol at all. I can become my social self without it, staying focus but happy and cheerful using the sort of emulation. I recall how I am when drunk and that's enough. It was just me with brain chemistry a bit different but I learned how to control this function without inducing the substance.

11 years ago I began to modestly drink alcohol in social situation, like many other people. On rare occasions I got drunk, but usually drinking a bit was just 'a social thing to do'. However I hated the taste and side effects however small. I liked how it made me feel emotionally, and that's the **only** thing I liked about it. 

I would have been glad if someone told me back then that alcohol is not needed for being social or for being temporarily happy. I would have certainly avoided using alcohol as a crutch because I think hinders on developing social skills when I'm sober.

I vowed not to drink any alcohol for the rest of my life.",,False,,t5_2r275,False,,,True,t3_1gnhq6,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1gnhq6/achievement_unlocked_alcohol_not_longer_an_excuse/,

It assumes you live in a metro area where there are streets, and people walking around, or you can get to such a place with ease.

2. Walk slowly 
3. Walk with good posture. . . shoulders back and down, chest up and forward, stand as tall as you can, hips level (activate your glutes so your hip flexors shorten and your tummy tucks in) slow, rolling gait.
4. Slowly scan the scene ahead of you. Look for people who look like you: head and eyes up, looking around, open body language. 
5. No earpieces in, or headphones on, btw. 
6. Don't stare down into your device the whole time. 
7. Smile at people who walk by and make eye contact with you. 
8. Eye contact: try to look directly into the pupil (the dark center of the eye). The color of their eyes should be in your peripheral vision.  
9. Do this daily until you get bored of doing it 
10. Then, ask someone the time!

I never even fit in with the nerdy or introverted kids in high school.  All I could ever do was make polite and respectful small talk in a very adult-like fashion; only adults, of course, appreciated it.   As a guy, I never had these experiences typical of teenage-mid 20s males:

- making jokes about stupid stuff e.g. toilet humor, sexual humor 
- doing stupid (and potentially dangerous) stunts
- making silly vocalizations/imitations, e.g., of a machine gun or airplane, when telling a story or playing (I know this one is mostly kiddie stuff, but even extroverted adults can do this in small doses in casual/silly social settings, and I can't)
- being loud, even a little obnoxious when playing video games/watching sports
- using slang (even after knowing some of the words and phrases, I never learned the formula for applying the right ones at the right points in a conversation to gain the approval of or ""vibe"" with potential friends)
- cursing (in my mind/in private, I can curse myself out like a drill sergeant, but cannot bring myself to say curse words in front of others, even when the other person/people are young and comfortable with it, or are doing it themselves as they talk to me)

(As a side note, I noticed that some--not all--of guys such as these had a far easier time attracting girls than the intellectual, quiet kids I also felt inferior to. And I understand some of the reasons why; I'm well-versed in PUA/""seduction"" theory.  But that's a whole other can of worms for me.)

I want these experiences so badly that it's consuming my thoughts.  To be clear, I know acting like this at my age isn't entirely ""normal"" and will be seen as childish; I don't want to be like this my whole adult life.  I am approaching my 30s after all, and I'm painfully aware that most people my age are far past this way of life/socializing or simply never cared for it.  I just want SOME of these experiences as soon as possible so I can ""get it out of my system"" and move on from it like everyone else--or more specifically, like the stable, mature, fully grown up, young-professional-types who are my age (27).

How can I:

1) Make up for lost time and get a taste of the youth I missed out on?  
2) ""Get over it"" to some extent and learn to find complete fulfillment in more ""boring"" adult styles of communication?

If I sound creepy/like some total freak of nature, I apologize.  I'm already painfully self-aware, and would be inclined to agree with you.

I understand some may reasonably suggest therapy, but it is absolutely (that is, absolutely) not an option for me, for reasons I can't talk about.  I also certifiably do not have Aspergers/High-Functioning Autism, but note my similarities with/respect the struggles of those who do. Thanks for your insights!

The problem I have is that now (I'm 24), whenever I meet people with my family, I feel stuck in that I've already built up this anti-social image and my family just expect me to be quiet and it leads me to keep being that way.

For example, my sister recently got married and my family was meeting all the new in-laws. In this situation, my family already perceives me as anti-social and thus I feel like it would be weird and out of character for me if I tried to be more sociable with these new in-laws who I'm meeting for the first time.

To clarify, I can contrast this to situations where I'm meeting people when I'm not with my family. In these situations, while I am by no means a super social butterfly, I find it much easier to socialize and converse with people and don't come across as anti-social.

I guess the gist of it is that I can't shake off this unsociable character that I've forged for my self when I'm around my family/extended family and it hampers my ability to be more sociable and create positive first impressions with new people when I'm around them.

If I do ask her out its either a yes or no. THE ONLY THING THAT CHANGES IS I HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING A YES. So i decided to go for it. But I wanted to do it in a way that no matter what happened I had a good story to tell.

So I asked her what she was doing next Tuesday and she said nothing. I decided to ask her out using a line my friends and I joke about because its so corny. So right after that I asked her if she likes raisins. She said ""umm i guess"" and I replied ""How about a date??"" and she said  YES. So now I have an awesome story to tell my friends and I also have a date with a pretty cool girl.

Maybe it was because I was bullied at a young age, maybe it's my genetic makeup. I don't know. But During and after highschool, I embraced being alone and being quiet and nerdy. My weekend nights usually consisted of a fantasy novel by authors like Tolkein or Adams, some coffee at a coffee shop, and maybe some online gaming.    
     
But through my constant self-awareness, I realized I needed to change my social behavior for the sake of making friends, making connections, and for dating. I've definitely made some HUGE changes, and I felt like I was progressing fair and quickly. The problem is, again because of my incessant self-awareness and self analysis I felt like I wasn't being true to myself. I feel like when I make a constant effort to have a conversation and continue talking, that it's more of a performance than anything, and that anyone who chooses to like me because of it isn't liking me for who I am, but who I pretend to be.    
    
Yet, if I go back to being who I am, I am more likely to spend the rest of my life alone (which I have no problem to begin with, but it's definitely not healthy.) I used to assure myself that not liking people and being sour was not liking people was an ok quality as long as your not outright rude to people, and would look up to characters like Liz Lemon, who found love without changing who they were. But that of course, is just a TV show. Fantasy.

**Speak up and make sure that people hear you. Also try to speak clearly.** Often it is possible that people will don't respond to you simply because they didn't hear what you said. This happens more often than you think.

**Look people in the eyes and don't be afraid to keep eye contact.** It might be a bit nerve wrecking in the beginning, but once you get used to it you realize the importance of eye contact and how much it influences your communication with other people. 

If you are a person like me who has a habit of not smiling that much, **try to smile more. And if you're gonna smile, smile with your eyes.** People who smile without the eyes are only fooling themselves because people can see in an instant if a smile is genuine or not. This relates to the previous note. The eyes is communication tool nr.1, use them.

**Relax and imagine that everyone wants to be loved**. This may sound a bit ""hippy'ish"" but it might apply to you. I for instance am quite a paranoid guy who has a hard time trusting people, that's why I in the past didn't let my shoulders down or let people get close to me. Lately I've tried to approach people and situations with the intent that everyone wants to be loved, they mean well, and they just want to have fun, and there's no reason why I shouldn't be a part of their life. Just because I've had bad friends in the past who screwed me over doesn't mean that no-one can be trusted...

**Speak with emotions, not facts.** This goes for both speaking and listening. When listening to someone try to understand what they are feeling, this will make it easier for you to relate to them and you'll more easily understand what they are talking about, it will also make you more ""in the moment"" since emotional communication happens on more of an unconscious level compared to factual communication. Also, try to sound more emotional when speaking, if you're bored try to sound bored, if you're happy have some enthusiasm in your voice. 

**Live in the fucking present.** The past is dust. The future is dust. You can't change either. You have no reason to fear either because they don't exist. All that exist is what you can perceive right now this instance. If you want to make a change then you have to make that change now. Get in tune with the presence, that's where all the magic happens. 

**Do what makes you happy and don't let others dictate your thoughts.** Decide yourself what to think, what to feel and how to live your life. You're living life for yourself and no one else. Make this life the most interesting, challenging, coolest life that you possibly can live. 

These ideas are some that I've followed rigorously for the last couple of weeks, and I'm in a very positive state of mind compared to how I've been in the past because of it. I'm also socializing more easily and every day is getting easier. Going to subreddits like this and trying to improve oneself actually helps. Slowly I must ad. But the important thing is that there's progress. 

Hope some of this helped others like it's helped me over the last couple of months. 
 

edit: I just like to point out that you can improve your future, of course you can. I was focusing so much on the need to draw attention to the presence that I got a bit carried away. 

edit nr2: jdmCrush added this to my tip on smiling: **Smiling with you eyes means that you're squinting a little bit**. You can't fake a true smile with just your mouth.

How do I fix this?,EmptyMargins,162,26,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1axbnm/unbalanced_conversations_no_one_ever_asks_me/,"Recently I've been working on improving my conversational skills and actually making some real relationships, but I've been noticing this pattern for about a year with my conversations: no one ever asks me anything about myself.  Conversations are always one-sided, where I ask questions and make them laugh, but there is little to no reciprocation with most people.  With me, conversations just don't happen unless I adopt a kind of ""interview"" style of conversation.  If I stop, the conversation stops, and people never make any attempt to keep things going.  I'll talk to someone for days and know how old they are, where they went to school, what they do, whether they're single, dating, or married, and there opinions on any number of things, and yet they don't even know the simplest fact about me, like where I live, or who I live with.  I've only had balanced conversations with people who have a very particular personality type, which is often assertive and highly extroverted.   

I suspect the reason for this is that I project some kind of closed-off vibe to people.  I know I have walls--it's something I'm working on--but I don't know how to really converse more openly.  I don't intentionally avoid talking about myself, but I know I have trust issues with people and that colors my interactions.  A friend of mine agreed that it's true people know practically nothing about me, but that I'm over-thinking it, and that most people aren't even aware they don't know a thing about me, but she's missing the point slightly. My goal isn't to make everyone like me or know everything about me, it's just to come away from conversations feeling some kind of connection, and this one-sided version is most certainly not doing the trick.  It feels stilted, awkward, and rarely comfortable--at least for me. 

This problem also presents itself when it comes to forming deeper relationships with people.  Ironically, even though I don't like to volunteer information about myself, I'm a really open guy.  If someone asks me a question, even if it is very personal, I'll usually answer without much thought.  However, it seems people are scared of asking me anything beyond the old ""how was your weekend?""  I just don't get it.

Lets start with the definition of Confidence by [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence): 

&gt; ...described as a state of being certain either that a hypothesis or prediction is correct or that a chosen course of action is the best or most effective. Self-confidence is having confidence in oneself.

Self-Confidence means that whatever action or decision you take, you are sure that it is the best one. Whether that be deciding what to wear today or what to eat, **you have to be confident that you are doing the right thing for yourself**. This includes what you say. If you say everything like you mean it and that it is the best thing for yourself, you will come off as confident. This guide will not be focused on girl help/dating however girls are attracted to confidence. 

The other day in highschool I noticed 2 teenage boys and 1 girl talking. You could obviously tell that one of the boys was shy and not confident. He was slouching (sitting down) and when he was talking he had that tone in his voice that showed he was not confident in what he was saying. The other boy was however and the girl focused her attention to him (you could tell this by the way she was standing and always looking at him, not the other guy).

One of the key steps to gaining confidence and being more social is to analyse social situations, even ones you are in. Now lets analyse the one I was just talking about. Before any of them said anything, the girl's body was turned towards the confident guy (analyzing body language will be a different part in this guide). So obviously posture is a key aspect in confidence, **no one wants to talk to someone who is slouched over, looking sad.** I suggest fixing your posture if you think you are like him, with a hunched back. How do you do this? Your ears, shoulders, hips and ankles should all be perfectly aligned vertically. Stand in front of a mirror to practice this. (Of course the ankles don't apply when walking, but when standing still they do). 

Another key role in your posture is your face/head. If your back posture is perfect, it can all be ruined by your head posture. **When walking, you should never look at the ground.** I walk like this everyday to school and even though I don't see anyone on the streets it is still a good thing to have. 

**Your challenge:** Next time you go out, even for a walk or to get someone from the shops, walk with confidence. Keep your back straight and try not to look down at the ground. Look at the horizon. That is all that I want you to try.

**TL;DR**

Making your posture good and head straight will make you appear more confident. As well as smiling and eye contact.",,False,,t5_2r275,False,,,True,t3_19rlim,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/19rlim/confidence_how_to_boost_your_confidence_that/,

Example: I'm with a couple lady friends (one of which I am with) I brought to a social event to have fun/meet people. A guy approaches us but snipes towards the girls and does not bother to make any small talk with me or acknowledge me.  Now, being a guy who understands social dynamics, I know exactly what he is trying to do (blow me out), so I don't react at all, in fact, I could give a fuck less. And if it was in a club or bar scene and they were complete strangers, I wouldn't think twice about it because it happens all the time (these are the things you have to deal with once you get a gf, reddit, it's not all easy work).

But when you are in a social situation that is part of a community, for example an after-class party, this type of behavior comes off as pretty fucking rude, especially considering the fact that you are interacting with people you know you will see again in the future, due to circumstance.

So next time your in a social situation, and you see a mixed group of people (guys and girls), when you approach them, approach the entire group, chat everyone up, get to know their names, make sure to ask how everyone knows each other, and then, if there is a girl you like there, you'll have the chance to talk to her. Her friends might even be all for it if you two click. 

But you should show that you are the guy who is interested in talking to EVERYONE, not just the hot girls. Otherwise, you come off as just another selfish asshole on the planet looking for his.

Just thought the Reddit community could maybe get something from my little rant here, because I feel as a whole there are more intelligent, conscious individuals on this site.

**EDIT #2:** Pronouns are hard.

There are 2 distinct options here, each suited for the proper situations.

* **(A) You could go the full-on confrontational approach.**
(This would work best with someone you've just met or have been introduced to.)

*i*) **Comfortably approach them and say, 'Hi!' with a genuine smile while making confident and appropriate eye contact.**

Simply saying 'Hi' is recognized as the best verbal suggestion of interest. One that exceeds any bad pick-up line in its intention (as most are vulgar/awkward/employ terrible rhetoric). You don't run the risk of offending them if they're modest and you don't run the risk of rejection if your attention isn't particularly wanted.

Eye contact, as commonplace and unnoticed as its significance can be, can be humbling and even intimidating even in the most casual of encounters. Just think of how awkward it can be to look a random stranger in the eye walking on the street, or sitting across from you on the bus, for more than a brief moment. Eye contact is powerful. It'll take a bit of practice to manage it well, especially if you're already juggling your own insecurities.

*ii*) **Employ casual body language and read theirs as the conversation progresses.**

In fact, you learn that we all operate on attractive impulses defined evolutionarily. You can reasonably attract someone if you're smiling confident, and don't smell bad. Though it's not quite so simple— there are a few expressive nuances to get ahold of.

&gt;Observing in context is key to understanding body language. Pay special attention to CHANGES in body language rather than the body language itself. Don't isolate yourself by constantly examining [it] when interacting with people. Otherwise, there is no reason to gain a social upper hand anyway. This is paralysis by analysis. (From the link marked: 'Reading Body Language')

[Reading Body Language] (http://www.wikihow.com/Read-Body-Language) &amp;
[Using Body Language] (http://changingminds.org/techniques/body/body_language.htm)

[Also, Be Wary of Your Own Eagerness and Her Politeness] (http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_18-3-2003_pg9_17)

[And If Anything, Know The Basics (for guys)] (http://www.askmen.com/dating/curtsmith_100/146_dating_advice_a.html)

All these links may seem like overkill, I know. And they are. Though they're effective at making you aware of subtleties that you may know of already, but haven't consciously grasped. It's this vague awareness that you' should remember when you're next in the wild— and consequently hone into second nature with practice.

.
.
.

* **(B) You can make your interest known from the passive and comforting safety of long-term courting.**
(This would work best if you're not one to opt for the confrontational approach, or if the object of your affection is someone you already know.)

*i*) **Treat them foremostly as a person; a friend— rather than as romantic interest.**

Becoming friends first is an advantage of getting to know them in a casual, no-pressure environment. Especially if you're young/new to the dating game. It allows the spontaneous bonds between you both to form and cement a strong foundation. Depending on how forthcoming and emotionally mature you both are, it might take awhile to achieve this. 

*ii*) **Afterwards, with enough rapport, make the choice to make your interest known or stay friends.**

Reluctance or ambivalence won't serve you well at this point. But hopefully you'll understand them well enough to make the right call.

I've never had a problem with who I am. I like the way that I look, I am intelligent and funny, I am a leader at work. Every time that I look in the mirror, I cannot figure out why I am unattractive for the life of me. No one close to me has any answers. They all think I don't date because I am not interested in women/gay. This is completely false though.

 I have had an endless streak of crushes that I have fallen in love with. Even though they respect me and enjoy my company, they have never returned my feelings of lust.

Recently I tried to escalate one of my crushes into a romance, with predictable results. Honestly, I just wanted to be out of the friend zone, one way or another. This rejection (you're creepy, don't rape me) was a blessing for me. Not only did I rid myself of a one-sided, parasitic relationship, it was also an emotionally volatile enough experience to be a catalyst for extreme change in my life.

  In the past week, I have consumed a ~20 hours of misc reading material about dating and socializing (www.girlschase.com has been a godsend to me, the guy has the exact same story and mindset as myself), and I have been applying the general theory of body language into my every day interactions.

I took over a new workplace yesterday, and it has been a great opportunity to experiment. I have confirmed that I have not been sending conversation partners the proper message of my intent through my body language. Here are some of the concepts I've toyed with today. All of these interactions took place through body language (in which I'm including voice tone):

-Framing the theme of your conversation (ex. Positive, Playful, Serious, Flirty, Informational). Stick to a social frame so your partner can feel comfortable as opposed to trying to awkwardly navigate a socially ambiguous interaction. Make sure your intentions are understood.

-Indicators of Interest (IoIs) and rewarding partners for giving them to you. For example, a girl I was talking to made an overtly sexual smile at me with extended eye contact. I made sure to acknowledge her with a frame appropriate, and rewarding response. If you ignore these from a romantic interest, they will stop flirting to protect their ego.

-Stopping unwanted emotions from coloring your interaction. Just a simple STOP with your mental voice is effective at clearing your head. I've cleared anxiety, negativity, and insecurity by returning to my default mental state with a well timed yell. 

This is only my second day of experimentation, but I am very satisfied with my progress. I realize now why I couldn't see my problem in the mirror: it's because I wasn't trying to socially interact with myself while I was standing there dumbfounded as to what my problem was. I have since started talking to myself haha.

I followed some of the advice saying that I should just wait for them to text me.  **The result** was that they never invited me to ANYTHING!  Not even to one event whatsoever.  So what did I do?  I looked for better friends and now I'm living a fantastic life!  No stress, no more depression, and most importantly, those old friends are out of my life now!

When I was with them more, I started to realize that these were my true friends and I shouldn't have left them in the first place for friends that I met last summer.


So here's my advice, if you have friends from elementary school or middle school that you have stuck around and got along for awhile, chances are those are the better friends than ones you have for about 5 months.

I've found it very helpful to keep a list of things that I can do that are outside my comfort zone - that way, I have less of an excuse for sitting at home all day.  Hopefully, if we compile a list, people will have somewhere to look for ideas, whether it's just a way to get out of the house, a way to meet new people, or even an activity for a date.  I know when I started trying to be more social, I found it very difficult to think of ideas for things to do, so hopefully this is helpful for some.

First, here are some of my own plans.  A couple of them I can't start until September when the University offers them against for poor students, but I listed them anyways.  Just for fun, the *s are things I've never done before!

* *Call up some old acquaintances and organize a pub night.
* *Dance classes. (Not until September for me.  Scary.)
* *Improv/acting classes. (Not until September.  Scary.)
* *Rock climbing for some alternative exercise.  Cheap for students! (Not until September.)
* *Take up swimming as an alternative to running as exercise. 
* *Try to learn to play squash.
* *Go to a pub by myself on some theme/music/social night.  There's a nerdy/gaming night at a nearby pub in my town.
* *Attend a couple meetup groups/events.  
* *Go to karaoke.
* *Volunteer somewhere.
* *Go on a hiking trip (perhaps several-day) with a group.
* *Travel somewhere by myself or with a friend. (Scary.)
* *Join a social soccer or other sports league.  Not too excited about this one.
* *Host a social event/night at my house.
* Ask any girl who I've just met on a date.
* Use part time work as an opportunity to talk with people.
* Keep up with current friends as much as possible.
* Call up some old acquinatances - not people who are already friends - for a movie. Super low pressure.


Here are some suggestions for other people. I've either done them, tried them, or already do regularly already.  So suggestions for other people:

* Take singing lessons.  It's a really good way to get used to your own voice, get used to being loud, taking up space, and being confident.  Even though it's a solitary activity, singing is often really tough for shy and awkward people, and I think getting decent at it can give a fair bit of confidence.
* Be an extra for some theater production.  I might do this one too if the chance pops up.
* Go donate some blood.  Not too social, but it gets you out of the house.
* Join a toastmasters group if there's a good one in your area.  
* Go skating/learn to skate, depending on the facilities in your area.  Ask someone for help for extra social awesomeness.
* See a musical or theater production.  Ideally, bring a friend.  You can find some pretty cool/cheaper things if your university has a decent drama department.
* See some musical performances or concerts.  Check out your local orchestra, too - its often overlooked.  If there is a conservatory at your university, check out their events page.  The stuff ranges from totally senseless to totally awesome.
* Go shopping and try to have fun with it.  Invite a friend if you can.
* Learn some sort of board or cardgame, and join a group dedicated to playing.  Better yet, ask them to teach you.  I haven't done this, so I have no specific ideas.
* Talk to strangers when out and about.  It's tough, and a more general suggestion.


What are your own personal plans?  Do you have any ideas for other people?  The more specific the idea, the better.  A specific idea is more likely to make us say ""Oh, I hadn't though of that!""

1348760673.0,125,self.socialskills,10kffl,Just because you don't talk much doesn't mean you're a good listener.,raven-jade,142,17,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/10kffl/just_because_you_dont_talk_much_doesnt_mean_youre/,"Hi SocialSkills, just wanted to share a recent epiphany that might ring true for some of you as well.

I've always considered myself a really good listener.  After all, I usually hardly say anything.  I hear every single word that people say. But I have finally come to the uncomfortable, but necessary conclusion that I am currently... a shit listener.

It's been slowly dawning on me.  When I'm in groups of people, I hear the words I'm saying, but I'm hardly staying present with them at all.  My head is usually in it, but rarely my heart.  All I'm ever thinking about is what to say next so I don't ""look stupid"", and while I'm thinking about that, the conversation has moved on, but sometimes I say what my mind anyway and interrupt the flow of the conversation.

Or I'll listen to the words, and think I'm being such a good listener, when all I'm worrying about is how people are seeing me, and why can't I be more like them, and how does it come so easy to them, and why do I even bother participating in these things in the first place.

Or when I'm with a person or group of people, I'll start panicking.  I'll make up a script in my mind of what to say and do and adamantly stick to it.  And I'm so busy focusing on my script, the person will be right in front of me and I'll cease to see what they're doing.  I'll try and shake their hand when they're looking to pick something up. I'll tell them my name when they open their mouth to tell me theirs. Little things like that.

I can now say that even though I'm one of the quietest people I know, I also know my listening sucks.

Fortunately, now that I've realized that, I've started to fix it.  In just a few days, all I've been trying to change is just how I BE with people.  I've been trying to give them 100% of my attention, not just with my brain, but my heart as well.

I think my social anxiety is inherently selfish -- by which I mean, focused on myself.  There's a time and place for selfishness, and sometimes it can be a good thing.  But more and more, it seems to me that being that selfish around people usually just isn't appropriate.

People want to know that they are cared about. Once they sense this from you, it will put them at ease. And once they feel at ease, that puts you at ease, too.  Good listening can help take so much stress out of interacting with people.

...

I guess my point is two things.  One: Look at yourself right now, and ask yourself: Are you ACTUALLY good at listening?

And two: Nearly every person on this planet has a *fundamental need* to feel understood, accepted, and cared about.  If you can learn how to give this to people... well... that's really much the foundation for good social skills right there.

Not to mention, it will make you a pretty awesome human being.",,False,,t5_2r275,1348760871.0,,,True,t3_10kffl,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/10kffl/just_because_you_dont_talk_much_doesnt_mean_youre/,

**EDIT**: There seems to be this misunderstanding about the purpose of this question. The point of handling the DEs (dominant extroverts) is not destroying their egos or scratching their self esteem and/or hurting them in any way. The point is when a person is talking 70-80% of the time and doesn't let any other conversation to take off, something needs to be done.

So I forced myself to join an organization, and I realized something--I am actually really good at socializing and small talk. I am good at it for about fifteen minutes and then I get bored, irritable, and tired. I simply stop engaging because I'm getting so annoyed of the conversation and I don't have any interest in it.

When I started to think about it--I've had a ton of people reach out to me to start deeper friendships and I always distance myself from them because I don't feel like hanging out with anyone, I'd rather be alone. 

I'm not sure why this is. I know that most conversations in general bore me, and I hate talking about gossip about people I don't know, celebrities, clothes... all of the things that it seems are required to be good at conversation. My friends even bore me with their conversations so that I find myself trying to get away from them before I have to engage in something I don't want to.

I'm not trying to sound like I'm above everyone, I really am not, but I do yearn for conversation that has some meaning. When I do find someone that can converse with me about things I'm interested in, I get extremely excited and can go on for hours. 
 
There are maybe two people that I know of that I actually enjoy talking to.

Growing up, I always was a tom-boy and had almost all guy friends. But lately, my problem seems to have gotten more complicated...

(Before I go on, a guess I should put a small disclaimer that this might seem kind of vain and stupid, but, here goes...)

Along with always having guy friends, I guess you could say I was also an ugly duckling. I was always super tall, super skinny, gangly, flat chested and broad shouldered. But in the past year or so, my body has decided it's time to become womanly! I sprouted hips and boobies (yay!) 

However,  I’ve moved to a new place and am trying to make friends. But whenever I go out, I usually find myself more comfortable chatting up groups of dudes. I feel super confident and comfortable. The problem is that these guys usually take my friendliness as flirting and are disappointed and sometimes even angry when I tell them that I’m not interested in anything more than friendship. I’ve even had guys tell me straight up, “Well that was a waste of an evening…” Since I’m so used to being a bro/ little sister type, I never seem to even notice that they are interested, let alone think that they would even be interested, and it makes me feel like a bitch for unknowingly leading these guys on.

I’ve tried approaching girls, but I never know what to say to them. My usual topics of conversation are stupid sci-fi movies, poop, barfing, weird nerdy things, smoking weed, and drinking. Girls usually don’t seem to respond to this as well as dudes do… I try to talk about make-up, guys, and clothes and stuff, but it always seems awkward and forced and it never seems to go anywhere. I’ve even tried being just my weird, dudely self, but I’ve been made fun of for it by some mean girls before, so I get really self-conscious  when I bring up these kinds of things and again I feel awkward and even sometimes creepy. I’ve had girls tell me I should try to be more girly and I never have any idea what that means.

Is there something I’m missing when it comes to girls? Or is there a way to talk to guys comfortably with out giving them false hope of getting in my panties?

One problem I seem to have however is that I have a tendency to dwell on things that I really shouldn't.

A few examples of this would be:

* If I'm texting a girl and she doesn't reply to one of my texts I become afraid that she doesn't actually want to talk to me and that I'm annoying her. The thing is however, I'm aware we're both busy people and people will initiate conversations with me. It even happens that I do the same thing where I forget to reply to a message before it's too late to even bother.

* After hanging out with a person or a group, I'll always worry that I'm doing something wrong and that people don't really like me. I realize this isn't true however because I'm very often invited to things and there are never any actual signs that people dislike my company.

I realize thoughts like this are irrational but I just can't convince myself to stop thinking like this. Someone could come up to me, tell me they enjoy my company and they'd really like to hang out with me again and even then I'd be questioning whether or not they were being honest or just being polite.

Is there anything I can do to help stop these thoughts? I feel like it's causing me a lot of stress when it really shouldn't.

___

As an introvert, your instincts don’t push you to be more social, they instead push you to do your own things, by yourself. At the same time, you still crave face-to-face social interactions, and you would love to spend your weekend nights in great company.

Introverts love to be social, but not too much, not too little, just right. If that’s what you want, then read on to discover 4 of my best strategies that will get you ready to start living a great social life.

**How To Be More Social By Understanding Friendship Dynamics**

To optimize your time, as you’re making new friends, I’d like to introduce you to a friendship dynamic that will help you make sense of why some people just click and become friends, and other don’t.

Before you start looking for new friends, get clear on whether you want close or casual friends. Once you know that, you have to understand that other people may or may not have the time and energy required to maintain a close and meaningful friendship.

Some people have a small circle of close friends and a wider circle of casual friendships, some only have casual friends, and others only have close friends. When you meet new people, expect them to act according to their current friendship life: if they have enough close friends already, then they’ll only be open to casual friendships.

**Set Weekly and Monthly Social Rituals**

As we said at the start, your instincts won’t push you to socialize unless you’re very lonely. That’s why you need to set up your life in a way that it has a social component. You need to put regular systems that will make sure you remember to do your socializing.

I suggest that you start by setting a weekly reminder in your calendar that reminds you to take one hour of your time and follow up, email, text, and call whoever you want to stay in touch with, or whoever you have something to say to. This makes sure that you don’t neglect people and cause them to just forget about you.

With that, you can subscribe to one or two interest groups that hold monthly meetings and commit to always showing up for the events. You can also take it to the next level by joining the organizing team, and become strongly involved. This will make sure that every month, you get to meet new people.

These kinds of regular commitments will bring you peace of mind because you realize realizing that, for the rest of the time, you can enjoy your solitary activities without feeling guilty about it. They also get you the friends you want in a semi-automatic way, as long as you stick to your rituals, you don’t have to worry about it.

**Focus On Groups Of Friends, Not Just Individual Friends**

Another trick you can use to be more social, is leveraging the group-effect. When you only have individual friends, you still have to do all the work of following up, making plans, and inviting people. But when you make friends, introduce them to each other and form groups of friends, it’s a different world.
Within a group of friends, everyone makes plans, not just you. Everyone also talks and texts everyone, so you don’t have to contact everybody to make something happen. And you don’t get to feel desperate because your friends will seek out the group to go out and be social on the weekends, automatically.

To benefit from the group-effect, make sure that you introduce your new friends to each other, every single time.

**Reach Your Socializing Sweet-Spot**

In it, I will show you the best techniques and strategies for meeting and making friends. I’ll also share with you new tips for having amazing conversations, that instantly make people want to get to know you.

This is my personal experience, so it can work differently around different people. This advice is for those who do not have a strong voice or a strong presence in a group.

Some of my friends have strong personalities. They make sure they are heard whether what they say pertains to everyone or not. There were times when I would say something, and it's completely ignored. I'm sure a lot of people have that experience in groups. When a dominant speaker of a group is speaking, you will never get a say or an opinion that the speaker will think is more important than his unless you're another dominant speaker. People want to talk about themselves as much as possible. Listening is a hard job! They want to state their opinions. As long as they think you're alright, they don't ignore you out of spite. It's all about timing. It's almost impossible to listen to two people coherently at the same time, and you sure as hell won't be able to pay attention to both. What generally happens is that people default to listening to the dominant speaker or the flow of conversation of the group. In some cases, someone will listen to what you're saying instead of the head.

Speaking your opinion is all about timing. When the conversation dies down slightly, you will have the chance to voice your thoughts. There are moments of silences when you know that the train of thought in the conversation has reached its end. It's when people start looking away from whom they were talking to or filler comments are put in. People want that void to be filled, and you can be just the person for that.

It may seem like a cop-out way to socialize in a group to some, but you will be heard if you try to find the right moments. There's no sense being out there while people are shouting to be heard.

I hope this helps.

I'll skip the auto-biography of how I changed as a person and go straight to what I wish I knew a couple of years ago. 

**1: Focus on other people around you, not yourself**. Forget about yourself. Look at other people's faces, eyes, gestures and listen to their voice. Absorb the hell out of what they are trying to convey. Understand them. Then,  just respond naturally without trying. 

Communication is a two way street (I know, its a cliche), and what I've done wrong, and probably many others, is to focus to heavily on what we ourselves are doing in the present moment (e.g. ""am I sitting right?"", ""am I enthusiastic enough?"", ""what do I do with my hands?!""). We do this by using many of the social skills we've learned from sites such as this. However, this distracts us from actually communicating. It fills up our head with pointless thoughts that isn't helping us socially at all because it leads us to focusing on ourselves, not the other person. So that's the first thing I wish I knew the most: Focus on what's happening around you. Respond naturally to information around you, just react. 

Likewise, after you've said something, look at people to see their reaction. That's where you get the cue for where to move onwards. People give out all sorts of sign, and they are right infront of us, so take advantage of this because it will make communicating a whole lot easier.

**2: Don't dwell.** If you said something wrong two seconds ago that sounded silly, the chances are that you noticed it more than anyone else did. If you think about it from there on it affects your socializing negatively, and you are the one who decides what to think, so think pro-actively and don't let stupid memories influence you to the point where it hinders your progress. 

**3: Laugh at yourself and don't take things to seriously**. Life is short, there's six billion people on earth, there's wars all over the world, people are starving to death somewhere in the world right now, your forefathers had to kill animals to eat and live and run without fancy shoes, the universe is ridicolously big and might one day implode in on itself, the earth is slowly dying, the world will go on without you.. These are reasons why we shouldn't take ourself so seriously, I personally don't matter in the big picture. So why not laugh if we fall on our arse, if we say something stupid, if we did something weird? Enjoy the moment and share it with others. Never take yourself seriously (ofc there's no need to bully yourself, but have some humour). 

**4: Be honest and speak your mind**. Don't waste time being shy and quiet if you want yo become better socially. Let the world know what you think and you'll find that you're a bit happier knowing that you've spoken your mind. Honestly, it feels good to express oneself, and I don't think we do it nearly as much as we ought to. 

**5: Don't be afraid to fail**. This is also a cliche but its priceless. Give it everything, you've got nothing to lose. People who are amazing at something are so because they practised and got better. Arnold got better because he tried and tried and tried, same goes for Michael Jordan, Steve Jobs and other inspiring people who weren't afraid to get back up after falling down. So don't worry that everything might not go  well every time in social situations, you'll get another chance. 

**6: Nobody's perfect**. Everybody has their worries, their concerns and doubts, just like you. So don't be afraid to have faults, we all have them. 

**7: Stop thinking that you know what people are thinking, give them the benefit of the doubt**. A lot of the time I used to think that people didn't like me, thought I was weird, fat, etc. But, this was people I was passing in the street who maybe just looked in my direction. I had no way of knowing what they were thinking, but I projected my stupid negative self-beliefs onto them and it ruined my day and my interactions with other people. So stop speculating and guessing what other people my think of you, you don't know, and at the end of the day you ultimately decide how to think of yourself. Project good self-beliefs if you are gonna project it at all. 

**8: Give of yourself** Churchill said: ""You make a living by what you get; you make a life by what you give."" This is true in social situations too. Don't be afraid to giving someone a compliment, laughing at their joke, being interested in their opinions, and validating them. If you do this to others, before you know it they'll do it to you and you'll have a richer life in many ways.",,False,,t5_2r275,1370249353.0,,,True,t3_1fkkkd,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1fkkkd/my_game_changers/,

I't been nearly one year since I got out of a relationship (6&amp;1/2 years) that left me emotionally drained, killed my self esteem and destroyed the little social skill I had.
I've rekindled with some old friends, but they're all the lone wolf type, meaning that there's little to no chance to build a mixed group with them.
Now as an architecture student, I started my master's degree last february and was lucky to end up in a studio with a really good vibe.
I've managed to make some friends, but it doesn't get out of the studio.
I still managed to put together a barbecue two weeks ago where everybody came and had a good time, and I'm doing it again this week.

But I realized today that I might not connect with these people because I'm ""that guy"":

-always trying to be the center of attention, even if it means making a fool of myself.

-wearing my insecurities on my sleeves to the point of having people telling me to stop demeaning myself.

-having problem to empathize with them and talking a lot about myself.

-feeling as if I give a ""needy"" vibe

Beside that, I always try to help when I can, I always try to keep myself from saying hurtful things, but I feel that in the end I lost their respect, and I feel like they're not glad to see me anymore.
The people with who I connected the most don't send me text anymore, and I feel more lonely everyday.

As I said it's been nearly a year, a lonely year, and I'm starting to lose hope of ever becoming less awkward.

Do any of you have any advices?

EDIT:
I woke up this morning to find all of your replies, and I must thank you all. I wouldn't have imagined this would get noticed so much.
I feel like those are mostly great advice, and I'm going to try to find balance within.
It's just hard when i feel like I don't exist if people don't acknowledge me, despite knowing that this way of thinking is wrong.
Like most of you said, I think the answer lies in having the life I want without depending on anybody. I'm gonna try and take time of my studies for my hobbies.

The issue is, I don't know if she's single or not. So, my question to all of you is, how to I confidently ask her if she's single without making it seem like I'm only asking because I want to start something with her? While this definitely seems contradictory and misleading, I ask for this key distinction because, if she does have an SO, I'm still willing to be friends and if she does, I don't want to make things uncomfortable in the sense that she'd think I'm only meeting her to start a romantic interest.

As a further extension, how I do comfortably ask any girl this question without seeming interested? Say, as part of casual conversation if I just met someone else.

So, how should I proceed?

Obviously, we already have /r/r4r, but it's not really ideal for this sort of thing, and I feel like many of the members here might be more shy, and prefer to have some assurance that they'll be able to meet people who understand the situation they're in.

Would there be interest in this sort of thing?  We don't get too many posts here, so there's probably no point in having a whole subreddit dedicated to this.

-Learning to mix cocktails (Useful in college, of course don't overdo it)

-Learning Spanish and German

-Reading 2 books per month

-Learning New Card Games, Poker Strategies

-Watching as many tv shows as possible (in one-episode doses, to avoid wasting time)

-Briefly playing new video games (again, i really try to cut down on this one, but it helps to know about them for your gamer friends)

-Catching up on movies I've missed out on (or foreign films)

-Reading about cars and sports (This one is a bit halfhearted-I have trouble giving a shit about these two, but they're the two things men talk about most).

You seen her in such and such class, there is your opener. Now go over and say hi, or do you need me to do that for you."" 

I now try to take this voice and sudo-become it at times, I want to do something fun but friends are being too lazy (even though they would enjoy it) I project some Highway on them. For example, the past two shows we went to everyone at first was all meehh its expensive (15$ show) so far blah blah blah. So I went and bought 4 tickets and said Im going Im driving i have 3 extra tickets all you lazy motherfuckers have to do is get off your ass and hand me $15 dollars, or do you need me to do that for you. 

Now some might say that is pushy and to be fair it is but you cant always do it for what you want to do. You have to bring it into your group of friends. I like military structure so I use that when looking at social group structure. My one friend is 1st Liutenant me and another are GySgt. and the rest of the people are PFCs. We like to do everyhing as a group so if either one of us three has an idea we have a real hard time getting everyone to agree to do it. So the main goal of us as GySGTs is to get everyone motivated and going. 

Believe it or not but it works out insanly well. Also, it applies to everything you do want to start working out or staying on that diet, let Gunny Highway help. I know this is kind of rambling but its really helped me and if one person out there can find some tips in this I would be so enthused. So if you are intrested watch Heartbreak Ridge (some may find it dated and lame, yeah its corny deal with it) and build your own Gunny Highway and start improvising and overcoming, Hoo-ahh!",,False,,t5_2r275,False,,,True,t3_1a3h05,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1a3h05/be_your_own_gunnery_sergeant/,

I'm a student from middle-level income family in a poor country, who worked his ass for years to get accepted with scholarship to a rather good university abroad. 

Even though I'd like to concentrate on studies, I still want to socialize and make new friends. I occasionally hang out with a bunch of (somewhat) nice guys who I met earlier this month. 

But here's the deal: sometimes I feel really uncomfortable and left out in their company. The reason is that they often tend to pick topics I never had a chance to try out due to my background, like luxury cars or expensive trips to other countries for holidays. I can't contribute to dialogue, and moreover, I get an uncomfortable feeling that they're normal people living their full life, and I don't belong to their company. 

Like if this wasn't enough, they also tend to interrupt me or not notice me talking. I don't think this is done on purpose though, as my voice was always rather quiet, and they're pretty noisy guys.

Overall, this seems like a nice company to hang with, and most of the uncomfortable stuff is basically caused by my own social awkwardness.

So, could you please advise me on what do I do to overcome this feeling?

Having confidence is what really separates you from most guys. There is a reason why so called ""assholes"" get a lot of women, because they convey confidence to women. In reality, girls know exactly what these guys want, they know that the men are sexually interested in them and they know that they are not scared and they are confident with their intentions. This means that they don't beat around the bush, nor do they spend much time being the girl's friend. They are direct with the girl and they are usually not too insecure.
You don't have to be a douchebag to get women, but there are a lot of things you can pick up from these type of guys.

Let's put a common situation in mind. It's 6:30 p.m. and you're going to your favorite coffee shop to get, well coffee or whatever it is you like.

You take a seat a table, you see a girl that you find very attractive sitting down at another table. She looks very preoccupied with her phone.

There are certain ways you can go about this. You can go with the passive route
Hey, sorry to bother you but I was just wondering if you know what time it is?
The passive route can be many things, but it usually starts with some sort of apology or the like and some bullshit reason to talk to them
Now let's look at the more direct route.

Now if the girl was sitting down I personally would just go and sit down at the table first then stick to introductions later, mostly because I don't like talking to a person when they're sitting down and towering over them. Regardless, I recommend you do this because it does convey confidence. So anyways we're going to say something along the lines of..

Hey. I saw you, I think you're adorable and I want to talk to you. What's your name?

This is really clean and easy, and most girls will absolutely love you for this. With this, you're not spilling bullshit, you're direct with telling her you find her attractive, and you're conveying confidence. If you're scared of this approach because of rejection, then you should really think about how exactly that affects you. There is not magical way to not get rejected, there is no guaranteed way a girl will not reject you, but that is perfectly fine because there are millions of girls out there and just because one rejected you doesn't mean the next one will, you can choose to see a rejection however you want to see it, and it doesn't have to always be negative. Rejection can actually be fun if once you get past it a few times, you just don't need to take it so hard on yourself. A lot of guys don't tend to be so direct with their intentions because they are scared of rejections, but would you rather play it safe and be passively hitting on her to see if she possibly likes you back or are you going to put it all on the line and *lead* the way she feels about you.

We men are suppose to be bold and confident, we're not suppose to play it safe and be pussies, we're suppose to know exactly what we want, and we do whatever it takes to get that, it's just a matter of not being scared, easing up, and not taking it so seriously. This doesn't mean you be an asshole and treat women like crap. It just means you put yourself and your intentions in front of you and you take charge of your life. You can apply this concept to other parts of your life as well.
I would really like to your guys' feedback and if I can, help in any specific issues you might be dealing with. Hope reading this gave you at least a little bit of insight! ",,False,,t5_2r275,False,,,True,t3_1kdh4b,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1kdh4b/having_balls/,

When I open up to people I have fun and am not shy at all and I genuinely have fun and make people laugh all the time. I consider myself a likable person when I'm in a happy mood around other people. but I'm an introvert. I also enjoy my own company just sitting in my room. And sadly I feel more content 90% of the time doing just that. But I want to be a sociable person all the time, not just when I happen to be in that mood. How do I do that? How do I correct this so I'm the person who hates staying home and absolutely has to be out hanging with friends/people rather than declining invites all the time because i don't feel like going out. And after you keep declining invites eventually you stop getting them. I feel this is why I neglect to have a girlfriend and why my circle of friends is small and not genuine. I'm not even sure if its laziness or me just being introverted. 

When I'm in school sometimes I'm just so tired and unmotivated that I'm not energetic/happy at all. Then one or two classes later sometimes I'm the happy, making people laugh guy that people seem to enjoy. I honestly don't know how to get into the latter mood more often. And whenever I'm home I am ALWAYS in the bad mood from just being on the internet so when I think about going outside to hangout I decided against it because I'm feeling unmotivated. But if I was in the happier mood I'd be like ""alright fuck it lets hangout dude.""

There are people who cannot STAND staying home. They have to be outside hanging out all the time. Because of this they are always talking to people and have a lot of friends. Also, I honestly think as a teenager all you have to do is actually meet/hangout with a girl once so you guys know who eachother are. Then you can easily consider making a move. That's why these people have girlfriends, they are always out and about and the girl's aren't intimidated by them because they are so inviting and always willing to dedicate time to others because that is all they know. I could be the most confident, best looking guy in the world but if I'm in my room being introverted nothing will ever happen.

What I'm asking is, how do I become the guy who lights up the room, smiling, whenever I enter? How do I become the guy who genuinely enjoys being outside/around people rather than in my room? Thank you.

Essentially I feel like I'm dead weight.  When it comes to socializing, I'm never included in conversations when it comes to social media.  IE sharing Instagram pictures, Snapchat, etc. and gossipy shit I'm never included.

I feel this way in every social circle I'm in and I feel like I don't belong to anywhere really.
About me:  23 m college student that puts myself out there in a lot of groups and tries to meet a lot of people.  I'm big into health and fitness, play piano, cars, and science.  However, I feel like I'm a boring person despite me doing a lot of different things.  Hell, I don't even play video games anymore.

I really feel like I don't have any close friends at all because whenever I have a problem, no one really feels comfortable to listen or care to what i have to say.  Let's note I try not to be a sad person as I try to be the life of the party (as guides tell you to, is to bring fun to the party).  Maybe I'm just the more sensitive person of the group about talking about 'feelings' whereas guys usually don't do that?  I would say I tell my roommate everything and he listens but he's in a relationship now and I rarely see him.

In my past 2 college years I have tried the best of ability to find parties, shit to do, etc. but this year I feel like I'm slacking because my classes are getting a lot harder and essentially, all that happens is I show up at the friends place and nothing else.  Like I have nothing cool, important, interesting, or funny to add.

TL;DR I'm having a case of feeling like I have no self worth because I have no close friends and no girlfriend.  I feel like I don't connect with any social group but I am involved in a lot of things.

The Ultimate Power Of Personal &amp; Social Networking

Picture your life as a tree. This tree is powerful. Full of branches with sub-branches stemming from it, even more stemming from them, leaves everywhere. Beautiful, isn't it? Networking is that exact concept. So much beauty to be found.

Many people have their core group of family and friends. Those people, for the most part, stay with you for long periods of time. Not much changes day in and day out. You know them well. You can almost predict what they will do next. They are very important to you, and that is great! The thing is, when you're looking to grow and find new and exciting things in life, these aren't likely going to be the greatest source for that. Friends of friends/family, co-workers, as you branch out farther, are more likely to surprise you with things about them you never knew, or introduce you to an interesting stranger. Going farther out, as scary as it may be at times, is going to be where you have the most likelihood of finding new opportunities, exciting changes, new faces, new hobbies, and most importantly, the chance to discover new sides to yourself you may not even knew existed.

Everytime you meet somebody new, find a new hobby/passion/interest, you are building a bridge. This bridge will likely lead you to things you never knew before. Sometimes these bridges may lead to be more of a dead end, but even dead ends can sometimes spring to life weeks/months/years later.

Here's a list of why networking is a very positive and rewarding thing:

1. Meet new and interesting people
2. You find out things about people you never knew before (""I never knew you liked kayaking!"")
3. You discover more things you like and realize you are ""finding yourself"" as well
4. You develop into a more interesting person with many sides to you
5. You have a lot more to talk about with others
6. Many surprising opportunities will spring from people and places that you never expected
7. You will be living a much more fruitful life and have the ability to make a much more powerful impact on the world
8. People will take notice and you will become more valuable in their eyes
9. A greater likelihood of all your dreams coming true
10. Your brain will be very pleased that it's growing, rewards will be abundant

If that list doesn't appeal to you, I don't know what will! I will play devil's advocate and list possible negatives, and explain why these should not deter you.

Possible negatives (&amp; how to overcome them)

A. You don't trust strangers, they could be negative people.

True, but you can always just ""fade to black"" with them (be unresponsive). If you don't let them push your buttons, they will stop trying to push them. You could fear your safety, but for any person who means to do harm to you, you have likely established relationships with many more that will jump at the opportunity to help protect you. Just play it smart and don't go jumping into stranger's cars, you should be fine. If you are in positive environments this is going to be a rarity.

B. You're afraid, for whatever reason.

The more you grow, the more this fear goes away. The only way to grow is to expand! Your brain is always desiring to expand, to learn, to become more than what it already is. That would mean knocking over these obstacles that only exist in the mind (fear, anxiety, overthinking, negativity).

C. You might not like where these paths may lead.

Then you stop with that path. You now know what you do not like or want. It would be a good thing to determine why you didn't like it, so that you can avoid similar situations. Even so, this is a part of growing, discovering what you want and don't want. Sometimes, the reason you don't like something is because you associate it with a bad memory. Maybe it's time to find a newer, more positive outlook on the situation. Perception is everything!

D. People close to you may not like it

People can become uncomfortable with others changing that they cannot control. I think the more important thing to determine is why are they so uncomfortable? Are they genuinely looking out for your best interests, or are they trying to control you? Sometimes people show their true colors when changes start occuring. Reassure them that it's all positive, and that being adaptable is a very rewarding thing.

At the moment, that's all I can think of.

Network everything! People, hobbies, interests, music, learning... the more the better! Go with what works and just enjoy discovering what you like and who you are becoming.

Here's a few tips for how to network successfully:

1. Be interested in them first. Not in a needy way, but by showing others that you don't have an agenda to take advantage of them, they will open up and be much more responsive towards you.

2. Study how to have deep and meaningful conversations with people. Surface level talk can get old very quickly. People will feel the desire to open up to you when you can successfully connect and empathize with them. Fortunately, we have an article to show you exactly how to accomplish this task easily.

3. Be aware and take note of threads. A thread is anything that you could pick up on that will take you down a different road that's usually got an association with the one you are on. For instance, I will be reading an article and someone will reference a book or author, and I'll take note to go look them up and see what they're all about. A song you like with a guest appearance from another artist, look them up!

4. Do your best not to burn bridges. I remember many times feeling justified to burn bridges when I was wronged. Did I really need to tell them I'm done, when instead I could have just done nothing and made it easier to reconnect when the possibility that they've learned and grown as a person occured? Let's say you end up constantly crossing paths with this person. It would be way easier to say that you've been keeping busy with other things than deal with the fact that you told them off. More to come on this topic in a future article.

5. Constantly search for things similar to those that you are interested in.

6. Always stay positive and down-to-earth.

7. Notice people's intentions. If they have a selfish agenda, either help break them out of that mindset, or choose to fade to black.

I want to have a girlfriend but I can't talk to people without making things awkward and I'm pretty sure I make people uncomfortable or even repulsed, especially girls.  I can tell I'm doing something wrong but I have no idea what it is.",DepressedAssDude,95,8,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/10tyae/i_have_aspergers_i_want_to_have_a_girlfriend_but/,"I'm a 20 year old college student with Asperger's.  I joined a small fraternity last semester and it's the first real group of friends I've ever had.  They've all acknowledged that I'm weird and awkward but they seem to be okay with it.  However, I'd like to have someone who I can be more than just friends with but I can't see that happening.  I have only one friend who's a girl and I've never met a girl who seems even vaguely interested in me.

Every time I try to talk to a girl I feel balls-out retarded. I met a girl in band in college in the same section as me and she's really cute and likes all the same shitty music that I do but the first time I tried to talk to her, when we were walking back from rehearsal together, she went on the first bus that came by which I felt was her way of showing me she wants to get away from me as soon as she can. I talked to her a few more times but she seemed like she was talking to me just to be nice. I told my therapist about it and he said I'm over-analyzing things and I should keep talking to her but last time I tried to talk to her she just hopped on the bus again, which she has only done when I'm talking to her. I don't think a girl like her would ever want to date a guy like me but she doesn't even want to make small talk. She's cool and attractive and I'm awkward and ugly so I can't really blame her.

I tried to talk to a girl the other day when I was at a party with my friends after we made awkward eye contact and said hi to each other but I felt totally awkward as soon as I started talking to her. I couldn't think of any interesting questions to ask her and I kept stumbling over my words and saying shit in a weird way. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong but it still all sounds awkward to me and probably to her too. I felt really uncomfortable and she looked uncomfortable too so I just backed off. My friend went up to her and talked to her for an hour straight and got her number, I have no idea how to do that. I end up reminding myself of the disabled kids in high school who end up clinging to the first pretty girl to give them attention even though she just wants to be nice and doesn't want anything to do with them.  I tried to talk to another girl at the party who I had met at another event but she just said ""m-hm"" and walked away.

People used to tell me I have problems with ""confidence"" and ""self-esteem"" and I really liked the idea that I'm an alright, slightly awkward guy who just has problems with himself.  Nowadays I feel like that's total bullshit and maybe I'm just a socially retarded guy who people don't want around them.  I don't think I'm saying anything overtly weird but my mannerisms and the way I talk and act are just really off-putting.  I can't put my finger on what I do wrong and neither can anyone else I've asked so I don't think it's something I can single out and change.  

My parents and my therapist tell me I get ""nervous"" and that makes me awkward but in situations like my first example I don't even feel bad until they start acting like they're repulsed by me.  My friends don't give me much advice other than ""BE CONFIDENT BRO"" but they make jokes about how weird that would if I got with a girl all the time so I don't think they have high hopes for me.  Out of the 10-20 people I know with Asperger's only two of them don't come off as weird and awkward.  At this point I'm just starting to think it was arrogant of me to think a girl would want a guy like me, someone with a disability that prevents me from connecting with people, let alone actually being alluring and attractive, when they can have someone else.

For the past 2 years I've been trying to be more social/talkative/get more friends, after a childhood of not really trying. However, after those two years, I just don't feel as fulfilled as I thought I would.

I observe people every day when they interact with each other, or take notice of how they spend their time together, their inner jokes, their other small interaction quirks, etc, and it *looks so fun!*

However, I must be doing something wrong, because I just don't feel fulfilled.

I did get to know (read: say hello, small talk) many people.
I got to know people a little bit deeper (read: chat about stuff other than our mutual studies).
I got to know people even beyond that (read: chatting with them about personal things, problems, sensitive stuff).

Sometimes it's fun to interact with people, however most of the time for me it feels... shallow. I'm not sure what I'm looking for; perhaps closer/deeper friendship than what I have available at the moment. 

So my question for the ones who changed into more social people is: do you feel that your interactions make you feel fulfilled? You couldn't go without sharing personal stuff with people, or being with them?

How do I transcend beyond small talk and into deep, personal friendship? How do I, using the batcave guy analogy, act like the person I am and not a chat bot?

I'm a 23 year old man with a strange job that involves close quarters with other guys my age. 10 of us in a room off and on for a couple of hours. That's all I the detail I feel I can provide at the moment.

""Jake"" and ""Alan"" are best friends who I've worked with on a couple of occasions. I dated Alan for a while, and left him when things stopped working. This was over a year ago, but it still created a tenuous working relationship when we started again. Just when I thought things were going alright, any comments I make start to get pointed reactions. Jokes suddenly aren't funny and ""Jake"" seems to play devil's advocate to everything I try and say. Others seem to be encouraged to do the same. ""Alan"" has resorted to talking to me like I'm an idiot. ""You know that's a joke, right?"" and ""You know that's not what __________ was about, right?"" turns into almost any interaction we have. He's got a new boyfriend, I thought things were good.

It all came to a head yesterday when ""Jake"" sent a group text from within the room to other people, including the the person who sits beside me: ""Remember when today 'poorsocialskills' was there, so everyone went to the other room?"" along the lines of that, give or take a few words.  ""Jake"" and I had a problem on a previous job engagement where he sent me a text that wasn't meant for me, but was discussing things I said. I saw my name on the text beside me, and I froze, but kept reading. It wasn't meant for my eyes, but it sure was stupid to text the phone next to mine.

My job requires a tremendous amount of continual focus - I wasn't able to continue so I left work. Came in the next day and talked to everyone in the room. I described that I had seen the text message and it had affected me enough to be unable to do my job. I explained that the person had previous issues with me before and how I had felt intimidated and hurt about the whole situation.

The reaction was less than satisfying and I think I made things worse. Aside from two people who reached out, everyone seems of the opinion that ""it isn't my business who doesn't like me"". ""Jake"" hasn't said a word to me all day, and I'm feeling like that's for the better. ""Alan"" seems cautious in approaching me, but more humane than he has been these past few months.

I'm 23 years old male. And I had all this time unusually high voice. When all guys of my age had voice break I continued to sound the same. That was a huge hit. I was thinking something wrong with me, maybe I'm sick, lack of testosterone, delayed puberty etc. I was laughed at so many times, this just crushed my confidence over time. And whenever I am confident, my voice is still very weak.

So this is how it began. But recently I was reading about how voice functioning and how it gets low in males and applied that to myself. I was pretty tall and my Adam's apple was pretty large also, so according to articles I must have very deep and low voice. And I've played with my voice until I finally learned to use my true voice. It is clear, deep, very pleasing.

I was speaking falsetto this whole time! It just seems that some anxiety caused this or something.

But now I want to use my true voice and simply afraid to change it. Afraid of questions, reactions etc. I can use my own voice fine alone, but when I'm around people (friends, strangers, anyone) I just can't start talking with it. I've tried many times. It seems like my voice cords aren't listening. Maybe I just can't relate this voice to myself? It's very deep, maybe I'm afraid to sound harsh or serious? I'm stuck. Reddit, can you help?

There's a couple of flatmates I know who do enjoy going out but they had to be invited to come out, they never took the initiative and for much of the first semester if not whole year people tend to just go out on similar days at similar times etc, so you don't need an invitation to go out. Obviously make sure you're wanted there, if you just spend the entire time in the corner it's not really that beneficial.

2) Alcohol helps everything, I'm from the UK so can legally drink and it may be a bit different, but you'll be separating yourself if you don't drink and that is often a problem. The only time I see this not being a problem is if it's against your beliefs, a couple of my friends who are Muslims don't drink and get along fine but it's much harder work that way.

I am Alex, and I am perfectly interesting in enough ways to keep myself happy. The worst thing I have done for myself is believe that these characters and images are what's needed to ""fit in"" and interest people when in fact we all have something interesting to offer. After all the social environment is supposed to be our place to go when it is time to relax and enjoy ourselves in the company of others and if you are not accepted for who you are, then you are just in the wrong setting.

First, some background. I have been socially awkward for most of my life, attributed to some childhood trauma with a step-mother. This does not manifest itself too fully in my social life. That is, when I make friends, I am fine talking to them and comfortably as well. I find the initial period of talking to someone extremely uncomfortable, and before have found myself compulsively lying in order to try to get the person to ""like"" me or find me interesting. This is especially prevalent when I have to speak to women and especially women I find attractive.

During a recent break-up, my ex told me not to ""lose my confidence"" and that (in part due to her) I had become I far more forward, assertive and confident person. I had no idea how she thought of it in this way, since to me I have always been ""faking"" confidence. I take the advice to walk with my head high and back straight and act it, which I do. Underneath, however, I am still cripplingly anxious.

I began (as part of my ""getting over her"" plan) to exercise more, throw myself into hobbies, and, crucially, start to attempt open mic nights. I have played guitar for 5 years but never to an audience. Needless to say my first attempt was dreadful, but I still got the polite applause. However, even though I had been sub-par, I felt the need to go back and try again. The next show I played I was far less nervous, and people stopped their conversations to listen to me. This was such a new experience for me, and a huge boost to my confidence.

Ever since then I have been playing as many shows as I can. Yesterday I played to an audience of 80 people, which is huge compared to the tens I had before. Afterwards, people were coming up to me and telling me how well I'd done and starting conversations with me, congratulating me for having the ""balls"" to go up and play. The ""balls"" to go up on stage and play was something that most of these ""normal"" people would never do. When I thought about it, talking to new people or trying to talk to women was nothing, really, when compared to standing on stage and *singing* to these people. If I can open myself up enough to let them hear my voice and my songs, why can't I just chat to them? Now where before I had to force things and even lie, I now had a great way to open up to people. I even later that night tried and failed to chat up the barmaid. Even though it was a failure, it was a massive step forward for me.

I realise this has become a bit of a ramble. But I guess the point is, throw yourself out of your comfort zone a little, and the results will surprise you. The fact people like my playing has helped me stand a little taller, and wonder what else about myself people might like. I've been able to do things like the eye-contact challenges with no problem, and in general have felt far more comfortable around people.

I hope this has helped some people realise that with a little push you can really make progress!",,False,,t5_2r275,1362070349.0,,,True,t3_19d434,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/19d434/social_confidence_and_open_mic_nights_my/,

Lately I've made a point of being more assertive. I managed to confront a friend today so I thought I would share.

I have a friend that's a bit passive aggressive. We've been getting closer lately. A few weeks ago she had some techy troubles that she needed me to help her with. I said ok and a few hours later she came over to my office. After some fumbling around **and some luck**, I managed to solve her problem. All is good.

Today she dropped the bomb on me that she was actually *""testing me""*. She gladly announced that I *""passed the test""* because I successfully solved her no longer existent problem. Obviously I didn't pass the test because I had done it out of blind luck. We had a short conversation correcting this. I don't even know why.

Anyway conversation was about to move on, but I reflected quickly and realised that I wasn't happy. I felt manipulated and used. I had helped her out of pure altruism and I felt she abused that. Well old me would've just let it slide and be happy, thinking: *""I passed the test, she doesn't think less of me. Why rock the boat?""* Not this time. I wasn't going to let my feelings slide. Why should I be happy about this test? I don't care about the test anyway. What I care about is that I was taken advantage of.

As she tried to changed the conversation, I called her out on her test. I asked her what she would've done if I had failed at helping her. How would she have solved the problem? Well she dropped the next bomb: she had fixed it hours before dropping by. Now mildly irritated, told her it wasn't cool, she was being manipulative and if I didn't know better, I wouldn't be so inclined to help her again after hearing this.

After saying all this, I waited for the inevitable backlash from her. But it didn't come! She attempted to justify her actions but wasn't being hostile towards me. Now I wasn't out to take revenge on her, but hearing her attempts at justification, I decided to just stop talking to her (since it's late) and have a more serious talk to her about it later.

I feel like by being assertive, I've opened the opportunity to talk about how I feel, my values and what I find important, instead of having to mold myself to the values of others.

1372474525.0,74,self.socialskills,1hah3f,I have to initiate conversation or it doesn't happen and it's killing my self-esteem. (my full story inside),1270,88,14,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1hah3f/i_have_to_initiate_conversation_or_it_doesnt/,"I went from having a small group of friends in highschool, to a lot more in college. I made sure to branch out, and I was in good terms with (and friends with) a great number of people in my dorm and classes. 

My first problem arose when, besides my main group of friends at college (and even then), in school I was not invited to parties as much as I would have liked and sometimes had to invite myself if I wanted to go(which is a no-no for me, I find it rude and offputting so I just wouldn't go), and this bothered me given how many circles I was a part of.  

After worrying over this for the first semester, and being unsatisfied with my original friend group, I decided to focus on individual friendships and stop putting so much effort into pleasing this group of people. This was a great idea, and I was much happier in the second semester because I finally felt like I made some real lasting and meaningful friendships. Also, I felt a lot more satisfied with my friendships within that group of people, because it was no longer so one-sided. 

Well, fast forward to this summer, and with a little bit more time to think about it, I realize I would rarely get texted, messaged, etc, first, even by my close friends. I literally am always the one to initiate conversation. This really kills me because it has to be something up with me, given how many people I befriended in college (100+ added to fb, etc) there should be at least some number of people initiating conversation with me. Worse yet, I even have to initiate with my closest friends. The weird part is, is that in person I completely hit it off with these people (especially my close friends, who I can have really deep meaningful conversations with), and when I do message them, I can always have a nice conversation with them. In person, I did not feel as if these friendships were hollow, because I was always happy to see them and vice versa. Any perceived hollow relationships, i.e. not into conversation, not welcoming, no response, I would promptly move on, so I don't believe it is an issue of me perceiving all interactions as close interactions.

 The problem is that from acquaintances, friends from class, friends from my dorm, friends from individual groups, and even my close friends, I have to ALWAYS have to be the one to send that first message. 

The only reasons why that I can really think of:

- Friendships I made aren't as strong as I thought

- They are, but people think I always initiate (would make some sense given how forward I am in person)

- I am not likable or interesting to talk to (I hope not this option, haha)

We can offer tips, we can offer advice, but we can not make you feel better. Only you can do that. 

It is a place where those of us with social misfortune *help each other*, and not just self-centeredly expect everyone to help them with just their own problems. The sidebar here gives us a suggestion to ameliorate this problem: sharing tips. How about some links instead of self-posts? How about some videos like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&amp;v=NDwoIftC_wc)? Social skills are sometimes hard to explain in words. Video is a great medium to learn social skills because you can see expressions and gestures, and hear tone of voice.

How about some more success stories? Even the little successes matter. It can be anything.

I have no friends. I have acquaintances that I occasionally talk with at school, but they're hardly friends. The one person that I could have truly called my ""friend"" hasn't talked with me since the end of last school year. We used to be very close, but we just suddenly didn't talk one day and haven't been friends since. I wouldn't even know how to approach him again.

Besides being my best friend, he was also the first boyfriend I've ever had. That didn't go over so well. We didn't do couple things. We never said ""I love you"", we didn't have a lot of physical contact, we didn't even go on a date. It was just sort of a title, I guess.

So now, I only have friends online but they're very far away and are adults, so meeting them is out of the question. They're not always available, which is okay. They have lives as well.

But now, I'm feeling very lonely. Possibly for the first time in my entire life. I want to have friends to hang out with. I want to have a boyfriend to cuddle with and go places with and be close to.

But I don't know how. I feel like I've set up an image that others see me as. People regard me as the distant, nerdy girl who is ugly and who hates everyone. That's not who I am, though. That's what everyone sees and as a result nobody wants to be in a relationship with me.

Before this year, I haven't regarded relationships as something that I need right now, but after talking with my friends online who are dating, it sounds like a wonderful thing. Telling someone that you love them, cuddling with someone... It sounds lovely.

I'm not too sure where else to post this besides here, but I do like the commentary on other posts I've read and I'm really looking forward to any responses I may get.  You guys give awesome advice!  That being said, I have a problem.

I mostly hang out with my boyfriend (who is my best friend), my sister, and various other mutual friends who are all guys.  At work, I will sometimes chat with the girls but I always get the feeling they don't like me or don't want to talk.  A couple in specific I feel like ""gang up"" on me and I know they talk about me behind my back.  And coming from me, a girl who genuinely tries to be nice and friendly to everybody, it really hurts.  I look at girls shopping together or getting their nails done together and it makes me so so sad that I don't have that.  Almost every day I find myself wishing I had a girlfriend to call up and bitch about the girls at work.  While I have had girl friends in the past, I've never been able to keep them, or never really liked them that much in the first place.  I guess the biggest problem was I felt like I couldn't relate to them.  My boyfriend tells me I don't need any friends that are girls because I don't really act like one, but I still want that kind of friendship.  I mean, I love my guy friends, but I am a girl (whether they think it or not) and I want a GIRL best friend.  

Just for reference, I do not look like an ogre. (Not that everybody bases friendships off of looks, but I think some girls do partially.)  I am 5'5, blonde hair and blue eyed, 115 pounds (petite-ish).  I am not a ""girly girl"" but I do wear makeup everyday.  I try to wear stylish stuff and put a decent amount of effort into how I look.  I consider myself to be pretty, and I'm plenty confident.  I LOVE shopping and getting my nails done, and my boyfriend has even been told that I seem like a girly girl!  So my question is, r/socialskills, what the hell am I doing wrong??

Then the next night the staff introduced me to a guy and his sister also both at uni, we all went out clubbing that night and it was one of the best nights of my life, jumping in the pool at like 4am, getting no sleep. I ended up cuddling this girl but going no further. Then the next night I ended up clubbing with the staff again and a guy I met who owned a pub that we went drinking at. And this whole amazing experience started from simply saying hi! Now I'm back home and I'm very sad it's over, but I'm happy that I didn't spend my holidays at home on my own!

I need to make sure my intern know I'm not interested in him without being too harsh. So for the guys here, what is the best way to get rejected? 

Here's the background:

I've been really cold to this kid because I thought he was a major suck up. He would endlessly compliment me, pretend he's interested in everything I'm interested in and keeps trying to hang out with me. This is to the point where he told me he'd be happy to wake up at 4am to go with me to take photos of the sunrise. When I pointedly asked why someone who clearly wasn't interested in photography would want to wake up at 4am for a fucking sunrise, he joked about how he could be there to make sure I get my morning coffee. 

Obviously I thought he was the biggest suck up ever. 

Then the other interns told me that he wasn't a suck up, he was actually into me and the way I treat him is getting him really down. He did ask me out several times but I didn't realize he was actually trying to ask me out. What I thought was, ""Holy crap! This kid is now trying to bribe me with food?!""

Yes, I know, I'm a huge moron. There's a reason I subscribe to r/socialskills, I spent most of my life with too little social life to develop any social skills. 

Anyway, I felt so bad about how I treated him. I hate suck ups so it got to the point where I only talked to him when absolutely necessary and when I did, I practically talk in bullet points. There were even times when I emailed him instead of talking to him even though he sits right in front of me. So I became extra-nice to him to make up for it.

Yes, I know, I'm really, really dumb. Now he follows me like a puppy. I'm not really sure how to get it through to him that I'm not interested in him at all without hurting his feelings and making things even more awkward at work. This sounds really cold but, I still need him to do his work and I don't have time to retrain another intern since I'm doing a 3-person job solo. 

So far I've:

1. Casually brought up office relationships and mentioned that I would never date a co-worker again. 

2. Mentioned I'm not attracted to younger guys.

3. Started using the phrase ""as your supervisor"" a lot no matter how power-trippy it sounds to remind him that I am his supervisor. 

4. Tried hooking him up with other girls.

5. Replied to every offer to hang out more with, ""No, thanks."" 

Since he's not getting the hints, it's time to be a bit more direct and make sure he gets over me fast. The love-sick puppy act has been going for nearly 3 months and it hasn't just gone away the way I hoped it would. It's getting really awkward, especially when we work late nights, and this poor kid is seriously ruining his chances of getting hired since people notice and think he's ridiculous.

And no, going to HR is **not** an option since they're the biggest gossips ever. They'll do nothing except for pry for more details and spread the news to everyone.

I can talk to any random schlum as long as I am not trying to be friends with them or see as a potential mate. Example, I went to Miami last summer and while I was there I had a good time. I would hit a bar and just strike up conversation with anybody and within he hour I was the most lively and social person in the bar. But in my mind I knew subconsciously that I am not trying to be long term friends with these people. We wouldn't exchange contacts and develop good friendships. They were just good company and nothing more. Now back to the city I live in, when I am around people who I want to develop a friendship with im not the same. Sometimes I can't hold the conversation one on one because I hope to be a good friend with these people. Same thing with women.

I think that my social skills are excellent. Whenever I am talking with someone, I can keep the conversation going and I am a bit of a talker. However, I have trouble being the one to start the conversation. If it's a group project or work, there's an obvious reason to have a conversation and I can do it perfectly fine.

But, if there is no logical necessity for conversation, I have trouble starting it. I think this stems from over thinking everything. If I'm in the same place as someone else by chance, I feel like they have something they are doing. They wouldn't randomly just be there by themselves. Because of this, I have trouble interrupting and starting conversation. Even if I did start a conversation, I have no idea what I would say to start it because there is no reason for speaking other than just to meet new people. 

I love meeting new people, but I think it's weird to start a conversation with the cliche ""How about that weather?"" or ""Do you come here often?"" or would ""Hi. I'm i_dont_translate. What's your name?"" work? I honestly have no idea how to start conversation. 

This especially sucks with the lady folk. I'm a generally nice guy, not ugly, and have potential with women, but I don't know how to start talking to one. Isn't it obvious that I'm only talking to them because I'm hoping to get their number and get something out of it? 

**tl;dr** How do I start a conversation with random strangers, particularly the lady-folk?

I need a little advice. I'm approaching the end of my freshman year at NYU and I've only made one real friend. She lives across the hall from me in our freshman dorm, and we hang out all the time (we're living together next year, too!). She has quite a few friends but it's not her responsibility to make friends for me, so I feel bad asking her to introduce me to people.

I have a lot of friends at home, so I'm confused as to why I've clicked with so few people here, especially since it's such a big school. I'm really interested in making friends within my major (physics), but none of them seem interested in being friends with me, not even the few other girls. I'm a very friendly person, but initially shy and I don't think it's helping that I'm intimidated by a lot of kids in my major. I tried to ask help from a couple kids in my lecture once on a problem set and they made me feel really bad about myself, with comments like ""you seriously don't know how to do that?"". I'm sure not all physics majors are like this, I know there are definitely some cool people I could get along with. How can I make friends at NYU, especially in my classes? And why do you think people in my major aren't interested in being my friend? All advice is welcome!

And if you did talk to strangers, what would you even talk to them about???) lost in my own head

**Who wrkmonkey is after talking to strangers:** really happy, confident, braver, more empathetic, less racist &amp; judgmental, improved ability to listen and read body language, more aware of my surroundings, more trusting &amp; maybe a little in love with humanity

Cheesy as it sounds, making a Habit of Talking to Strangers has changed my life. My new skills are transferring into the rest of my life so my networking and friendship building is amping up. Here's how I did it:

I broke my ankle in March and couldn’t do any of the physical challenges I set for myself (more snowboarding, running a 5k *sighhh*). Or drive for that matter. So here I was stuck taking public transportation to work when I thought of challenging myself to Talk to Strangers. I was scared to do it, but I was scared of snowboarding too and that turned out to be so much fun, I figured if I could fight through the fear, this could turn out to be just as awesome.

**I set goals.** My commute had 4 segments: (1) bus TO then transfer for (2) train TO, (3) train FROM then transfer for (4) bus FROM. So I made it a goal to talk to 4 strangers per day, 1 per segment. This goal is challenging but broken up into smaller, doable goals. And they can build on each other! Once I got going, I often found myself talking to extra people at bus stops, at the stores I travel to, etc. so that I talk to way more than 4 strangers a day.

**I ""faked it until I made it.""** I made up this ""character"" that was ""cheerful, confident, crippled and cute"" as opposed to ""shy, serious, scared, crippled and invisible."" It’s not actually a fake character so I wasn’t lying to anyone, just that it wasn’t my usual self. I found that as I talked to more people, I really became that ""cheerful, confident, cute"" character and it became easier for that to be my usual self as well.

**I make eye contact, smile, and have open body language.** This is so important: eye contact and smiling are like conversations in and of themselves. Tell people with your body language that you notice them, they are not invisible to you. My mentality going into this is that I’m sharing a secret joke between me and the stranger. Sometimes this is enough to coax the stranger into initiating the conversation instead!

**I talk to everybody.** I didn’t just talk to the hot members of the opposite sex, I talked to the grandmothers, the businessmen, the students, and within reasonable surroundings, the sketchier-looking people. There’s a saying that everybody is an expert in something that I don’t know about: I made it my mission to learn a little something from everyone. This meant training myself to really listen. Sometimes I start a conversation and just think, surprise me! And these strangers surprise me in the best ways possible.

Talking to everybody also helped me keep the hotties off the pedestal: I’m just talking to you like I talked to bus driver. ;)

I also learned how judgmental I was being. Particularly because of my injury, a lot of people, including the sketchy-looking ones, would wish me well or help me chase down a bus. Their kindness was amazing.

**Think of conversations as energy trades: you get what you give out.** If you give out positive energy and smiles, you will get positive energy and smiles back. This also means that **it’s not that important what you say: it’s how you say it.**

**I fail a lot.** Especially at the beginning. Oh man, the number of times I’d manage to muster up a ""H-hello"" that people would pretend not to hear. Or that ""conversation"" I had about the weather but all the kid could do was nod or shake his head, he was so scared of me. (Even though I was a ""cheerful, crippled, cute girl"" who could hurt you about as much as a baby!) 

And sometimes I just get so cowed I can’t say anything. :(

You learn what you can from these failures. For instance, that people usually telegraph with their body language if they are open to a conversation with you. That I shouldn’t wait too long after making eye contact to start talking because once the silence sets in, it’s not as easy to drive back out!

Sometimes the conversations just don’t last long and don’t go further than babbling about the weather. (Which to be fair, when the weather is good, it’s remarkable where I live.) But small talk is ok because it’s the positive energy trades that matter. If the conversation dies or doesn’t begin at all, it’s not your fault, or the other person’s fault. You’ll have so many conversations, fault stops mattering, failure stops mattering. You’ve traded good vibes and that’s a net positive from saying nothing at all.

And yes, sometimes conversations get magical. Like the girl I met who started going on about anthropology. (Totally didn’t get her contact info!) Or the boy who told me about how he wanted to get an MBA when he grew up. Those are the ones that make this “hobby” worth it.

**I really encourage everyone to challenge themselves and make Talking to Strangers a habit/hobby!** *Especially*, if that’s the social skill that scares you the most. Once you hurdle over that fear, it’s really a ton of fun and you get to learn new things all the time.

Would people be interested in joining me in a subreddit dedicated to working on the habit/hobby of Talking to Strangers? I'd love to build a community of people who are doing this/interested in doing this.

Basically whenever I meet new people there is a small part of me that instantly assumes they are better at me in everything and I'm afraid to socialize because I don't want to feel judged. It doesn't matter what it is. When I take a new class at school, everyone in there knows more about the subject. When I start a new job, everybody knows everything and hates me for being new and unskilled. I even have a ton of throwaway Reddit accounts simply because I'm afraid of the ""cool Redditors"" looking through my post history and judging me for it."" In day to day life though, it isn't until after I've spent a lot of time with a person that I can begin to feel on equal ground with them and be able to actually talk and hold a conversation with them.

The problem is it's hard for me to spend time with people because I'm too afraid to try and do something with them, and even if they invite me out I'm so afraid of how they will view me I'd rather just stay in.

The strongest example I have is my current coworkers. When I first started my job I barely said a word to anybody. After a few months when I got comfortable I could talk to them and be my normal, energetic self. I can even act like an idiot for the sake of a joke and feel fine now at work. But only at work. The moment a coworker says ""Hey, let's do something this weekend"" I become nervous again thinking they will now judge me in this social situation because we wouldn't be at work.

I don't consider myself an introvert. On a few occasions I've gone out to like downtown bars/clubs or to bookstores/coffee shops just in an attempt to meet people, but even the smallest conversation I have when anybody leaves me dwelling on it for the rest of the night over how stupid I probably looked to that person. Because of this I find myself choosing to stay home more and more. And the more I just stay home, the less happy I am.

Up until recently I have never had too many problems in social situations. I was a little bit awkward around girls, but that was about it. However When I was 17 I got fucking horrible acne, then I got rid of said acne. Unfortunately the acne left really bad scarring on my face. My self esteem has plummeted in the past year because I feel like people are looking at my scars and secretly judging me, which has made me timid and somewhat reclusive. 

I am undergoing certain treatments to get rid of the scars but I know they are going to be there through my upcoming freshman year of college. I want to know how I can be more confident in regards to talking with people (particularly women) without constantly worrying about my scars. I am committed to changing my predicament, which is why I have researched body language, and the whole theory of ""fake it till you make it"".

Fake it till you make it sounds great, but it is so goddamn hard for me to pull off because I keep of getting dragged down by thoughts of inadequacy due to my ugliness.

In some ways, I have extremely low self confidence, and in other ways, it's just fine.  It's enough that I get a reasonable amount of attention from women.  However, I really don't know what to do with them.  

I've never really loved anyone, and when I have tried dating, it was always short lived; I was really just going through the motions.  I've never met anyone who thinks the same way I do or enjoys the things I do.  I meet new people pretty regularly, but I never meet people who I can connect with.  I haven't had a girlfriend since I was 18.  I'm 23 now, though that fact alone doesn't bother me.

I also realize that my expectations are absolutely unfair.  I feel like that in order to actually have a real relationship with someone, they would have to be almost exactly like me.  Except, perhaps, better.  Is it generally considered a good idea to date someone who's very, very different from you?

I also understand that I'm very subconsciously afraid of failure, and unable to take risks.  Should I just say ""fuck it,"" and dive right in, even when my reasoning tells me no: that one girl is just too neurotic, and the next one too clingy?

The obvious solution is to just not bother with dating if I don't enjoy it, right?  But, I'm incredibly lonely, and I want to be loved.  Is there any point of dating someone with whom you could probably  never have a long-term relationship?  Someone's who's totally different from you and could never understand you?  Is there any point in dating when I don't feel capable of loving someone?  I feel like any relationship I have would be totally dishonest.  When she says ""I love you"", I don't want to have to lie.

* Social Gatherings - I used to feel uncomfortable here, I felt like I had to say or do something to be ""cool""; however, once I sat back and ignored the party, laid back in a chair and staired up at the stars or something, I found that people were drawn to me and wanted to talk to me. There is something mysterious about that person who seems to be perfectly content on his own while this huge party goes on around him that makes people want to get to know him.  This is effortless on your part.  Of course don't spend the whole party this way, if someone reaches out, give an appropriate response, they might take you around the party and introduce you to their friends or something.

* Introducing a New Friend to Your Friends - Often when I bring a new friend around my current friends, they feel excluded and awkward.  I do a couple things here.  First, I make sure to distance myself from my friend, say, if he's sitting on one side of the room I sit on the other, with my old friends in between preferably, and I keep contact with my new friend.  I keep talking to him across the room about stuff we've done or make inside jokes or something, this gets my new friends interested and involved in the conversation and eventually, you don't need to say anything to keep the conversation flow between new friend and old friends running.  (I'll stop here for brevity)

* Building Social Skills - Very easy, almost effortless, when you are out somewhere, at a store or park or whatever, and you see someone make eye contact with you, *smile* and say *hey how's it going*. The goal isn't to start a conversation (if you do, that's cool), it's just to build your confidence in your ability to connect to others. Often they will respond very well, it's not normal that strangers genuinely take an interest in them, and you will find that this brief human contact stimulates your mind and makes you feel better especially if you are in a grump-slump. Like Nike, ""Just Do It"".

* Passing Greetings - People often say ""Hey"" or ""What's up"" when they walk past each other. If you know their name, simply append it to the end, and you can be confident that they will like you more and feel more connected to you in the future. ""Hey Brad"" goes a lot farther than ""Hey"".",,False,,t5_2r275,False,,,True,t3_rrg0f,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/rrg0f/social_quicktips/,

This shows because I only meet up with them individually maybe once every two months, and even then, with such a long time of not seeing each other, it's still a pain to keep the conversation going for an hour. Usually, without fail, the conversations cover the following, in no particular order:

1. School/work/general life - ""So how's your internship going?""
2. Current events - ""Did you hear about the plane crash at SFO?""
3. Common interest - (usually only NBA) ""How about them Lakers?"" Barring that, I try to talk about some interest I know that they have.
4. Activity/event where we met - ""Ready for the next volunteering event?""
5. Other experiences - When my friends sense the convo is starting to die, they restart it with all the other social experiences they've been having, eating at this place or doing that thing with some other friends. Of course I got nothing because the sitdown at that very moment is literally the only real socializing I've done the entire month.

I guess it follows the FORD topics to an extent, but I think they're best when you meet someone new and not as something to regurgitate with real friends after already knowing them. I guess the only topic I could see talking about on a daily basis is the common interest, but realistically I could maybe talk for 5 minutes about the Lakers each day before it gets real old. I don't have to be talking with every person every single day, but I know to develop close relationships I have to at least do that for the people who I want to get close to.

So instead of more conversation techniques that are general, I just want to ask you what specifically you talk about with someone who you converse very regularly/consider a real friend. How did you get to the point where you have inside jokes and are cracking insults at each other in good fun? I apologize if this question sounds stupid, I'm just woefully inept at socializing. I cannot imagine how some people are able to have 5+ hours of phone conversations with the same person several times a week. I have thought about taking someone's phone and just poring through and analyzing all their text conversations, but I'll have to settle for asking this question lol.

I think it's because I don't see how their lives connect to mine, and it feels like wasted energy. Basically, if I don't see a close friendship developing out of it, I'm not really too interested. I'm still polite and ask boring conversation questions because I want to know generally how they are doing and what they are up to, but I don't really go beyond that. I also feel like I don't need to go deeper because I judge pretty quickly whether they are similar to me or have something to offer me or not long-term.

The issue is that this is most of the population... I think part of the reason is that I mostly kept to myself growing up so I feel like my experiences and goals are just different. It might just be my personality...I was always socially satisfied just talking to people in classes and really never felt a need to meet outside of class growing up. I would just go home and read books or play games. The way I related to people was doing stuff with them, not talking to them. I feel like I'm somewhat narcissistic/selfish as well, but I am constantly beating that down.

So far, basically I tried to change for a few years by stopping my alone activities so that I had to depend on people and started to live like everyone else, going out all the time and talking to people constantly, but that was hella stressful. I still did it anyway, but after a few years, I feel that maybe this is my personality. It just bothers me because it does make me happy to meet people (if anxiety subsides and I feel like I'm being good socially) and living a more closed off existence makes me feel like I'm missing out on something important in life that everyone else is experiencing.

My current situation is this:

*I have one close friend (my flatmate) and a wider group of friends (mostly his friends, who live in our block, but in a different flat).
*I get on well with him, but am still quiet and reserved around him. We don't get on with our other flatmates.
*I go out a lot to nightclubs at least four times a week. When we do this, we go to pre-drinks at someone else's flat (sometimes our flat) around 8, drink, then go to the club around 10pm and stay until 3.
*At pre-drinks, I basically don't talk. People say ""hey earthduck, how's it going?"" and I say ""fine, you?"" and they confirm their fine-ness and kind of wander off.

I think people have a perception that I'm just the quiet, shy guy. But I so badly don't want to be. I want to be like a normal person. I want friends that I just talk to and hang out with, something I've never had. I sit there slowly getting drunk watching them talking to each other for two hours and just wishing I could do it. The same applies to other situations. Sometimes we'll go to another flat and just hang out and I'll basically be silent be like an hour while everyone else talks. I just want to fucking talk, but I never do.

**My question is:** how do I change this? How can I talk to people without it seeming weird and forced? I'm just like a person who's there in the background, and have been for three months, and I worry that I've left it too late to make any kind of change?

Naturally, I don't want to walk in and be this totally fake person like ""HAAAAAY GUYS"" but I'm just wondering what I can do.

Thanks.

(As an aside, I don't think the reason for this shyness is real bad social anxiety or anything, but up until a year ago I had a very bad stammer, so I've basically never talked in my life. I did a programme a year ago and now do not stammer at all - only the one close friend even knows about it. Now I can speak, I just don't know what to say!)

**Edit:** Thanks for all the advice! To sum it all up very simply: don't over think it, work on the small talk, listen and keep it light. Thanks guys! I'll be coming back to this advice, I'm sure.

I'm Cookiemobsta, and I'm the new sheriff round these parts. I think that r/socialskills has the potential to be a really amazing community, so I've stepped in to mod. Here's what's in store:

**The Vision**

I believe r/socialskills can be both a resource and a refuge for folks who are struggling with social skills. r/socialskills should have a comprehensive list of social skills resources, much like r/fitness, so newcomers and old-timers alike have the resources they need to improve their social skills.

And r/socialskills should be a community where people feel safe to ask advice, find encouragement, and make friends with others along the same journey. Learning social skills can be tough, but we don't have to walk that road alone.

Everyone deserves good friends and a place to belong. Let's be that to each other, and help each other build the social skills to find that in our offline lives.

**How To Help**
 
If this is going to work, we need to do this together. I'm going to keep a close eye on the spam filter (looking back, there were some good posts that were getting caught in the filter.) What I need you guys to do is be deliberate to post and comment, and to let others know about the subreddit. We're lucky in that we already have a large subscriber base, but posting and discussion is pretty sporadic. If we can start regular posting, I think this community could really take off. **If everyone could make just one new post and give just one comment on another post,** we would be in great shape

Also, please let me know if you have any suggestions for the sidebar. I'm happy to link to any online resources that might be helpful, and if you mod a related subreddit I'd love to swap links. If any of you CSS ninjas would be willing to come down from your mountain dojos and help whip up some custom CSS for the subreddit, I would be glad for the help.

**About Me**

Want to know more about your new mod?  I did an [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r3wrn/i_am_the_author_of_improveyoursocialskillscom_and/) a few weeks back and it should give you all the information you need. If you prefer the tl;dr, I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome at 13 and have spent the pack 10 years studying social skills to overcome the challenges of Asperger's. I've learned a lot (and wrote an online [social skills guide](http://www.improveyoursocialskills.com) to prove it), but there's always more for me to learn!",,False,,t5_2r275,True,,,True,t3_rqkqt,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/rqkqt/announcing_the_rebirth_of_rsocialskills/,moderator

Every word that comes out of her mouth is a complaint or a nasty comment about a colleague. We work in the mental health field and our job is very stressful, so I try to make sure that whatever work-related experiences over which I have control are as stress-free as possible. 

Since I have to share a space with her (there is no option to switch offices as they want team-mates to be physically co-located), most of the time I just nod and try not to engage in a back and forth with her, or give a generic noncommittal response. However, sometimes she corners me to let off steam and launches into diatribes about a particular coworker or situation. I'm very uncomfortable with it and she will say things like, ""haven't you noticed that so-and-so acts like this, and it's COMPLETELY inappropriate?"", or ""keep an eye out for so-and-so, she will stab you in the back"". She will complain *at* me about these issues for 10-15 minutes and it seems she expects me to agree with her or join in. I'm extremely uncomfortable with this as I try to keep relationships with colleagues pleasant and don't want to cause any drama at work. I'm significantly younger than her and nonconfrontational in the workplace, so I feel somewhat powerless to do anything but listen.

She's done this several times but yesterday was the breaking point. I was on my way out the door at the end of the day and she cornered me to complain about our third office-mate. She carried on about things he does to bother her, the offical complaints she has filed against him and how he clearly ""hates women"" because he used the term ""bitch"". Bear in mind, this is a 50-something father who is admittedly a little weird, but overall a very sweet, helpful and pleasant guy. She was practically shouting at me about him, and our office door was partially open. The coworker she was complaining about walked in while she was saying these things and I have no doubt he heard some (if not all) of it while he was walking down the hall. He didn't show up for work today either. I feel horrible and I don't want him to think that I was an active participant in such a malicious conversation. 

Do you guys have any advice on how to handle this situation? Particularly how to tell her something along the lines of, ""hey look, this conversation is really negative and I'm uncomfortable ripping on my coworkers like this""?

TL;DR: my coworker constantly trash-talks and complains about our colleagues. I'm tired of her negativity and want to effectively (read: professionally) deflect/avoid these conversations.

Anywhos, I thought I'd share a few memorable experiences and see the feedback.

I grew up in a City and as with most, there was an Underground system, you get the image. Quite often I'd observe people and I soon realised that I was doing it - instead of just zoning out looking at someone's shoes or out the window. Anyway, as most were Tourists coming in from the airport I lived near, I wanted to give a positive impression of my City.

My heart would beat to the point where I'd have to do something, either get off the train or talk, and I'd give in - just an opening

""Hey, where have you come from?"" was usually the opening line, and I'd make sure my body language was non-threatening. If I had a seat to offer, that could also be a good opening move.

It soon got to the point where I gave a few Students on a holiday a tour on the way to their Hotel and then dropped them off. The weird thing is, unlike some other guys, I could have easily hung around and seen if I could have pushed things further (you know what I mean) but that's exactly what I get from it. The fact I can give someone a positive experience through the medium of just talking. Most people are so ties up in their own affairs and they distrust everyone - especially in a place they hardly know.

So moving onto an example of a place people do know and are familiar with.

I use public transport a lot. Works out cheaper for me and the other week I had a 70 minute bus ride ahead of me. Along the way the schoolkids got off and there was a girl who had briefly said hello and other pleasantries with me. After a bit of time, 3 guys got on and it soon returned to that heartbeat moment - I just had to say something.

So knowing it could be seen as creepy, I moved behind her and as soon as I went to talk, the driver slammed on the brakes. Turns out that was my cue - and I managed to keep things flowing really well, learning a lot about her and vice-versa. After a while one of the guys joined in (he described himself as an ""academic transient"" who would learn where he went and had a job travelling round the country). before you knew it, all 5 of us were talking about life, where we want to go, where we've been and then said our goodbyes when we left.

Seriously, it's a handy thing - and after breaking that awkward silence once, you can do it again. Sure, sometimes you may get shot down or have a groan from someone but that's the worst they can do. Just say no. But remember, as they leave, chances are they'll think you're a good person - just trying to make conversation instead of being a face in a crowd.

So, anyone else here a fan of chatting with people you know nothing about? Needless to say, non-verbal communication is just as important as what you say. Don't have any posture that can be seen as deceitful or coming on too strong.

Now, back to lurking as I do quite often round these parts :)

Edit: Yes there have been plenty of times chatting with guys as well. It tends to be easier in places where people aren't so close together as they don't like being seen as ""weak"" or ""weird"" for talking to someone they don't know. I realise these 2 examples I gave involve girls, but there have been countless times, chatting and the like with all genders.",,False,,t5_2r275,1368713017.0,,,True,t3_1eg7v0,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1eg7v0/does_anyone_here_enjoy_talking_to_strangers/,

On those days, my arguments will tend to be full of um's and uh's, with me finally choosing a word that doesn't really represent what I think, resulting in a weak and sometimes unintelligible comment. I don't consider myself an incapable speaker, as I am pretty eloquent on ""good"" days. During those ""bad"" days though, the mental block can disappear by forcing through the conversation, often at the expense of my dignity. This can really damage my self confidence when I meet new people. I will tend to feel overly self conscious around that particular person later on, plagued with a feeling of inferiority which I am fully aware is totally unreasonable. I am aware that not everything is determined by the first impression, but first impression still plays a rather big role in how people view each other. 

I can speak, read and write Thai and English fluently (well I think my English is pretty darn good anyway) and trying to teach myself Japanese. With English and Thai, I've been observing that when I get a block in one language, the other language seems fine. I've had them alternate on certain days, be perfectly fine at the same time on certain days, and completely die off together on certain (rarer) days as well.

I would like to be able to maintain as much a mental sharpness/fluency as much as possible and prevent falling into that worse state of mind. What exercises or activities would you guys recommend?

A few days ago, I posted my story here about grabbing people's phone numbers off Facebook, in hopes of contacting them later for hanging out if need be. Quite a few people were very receptive to the idea, but there too were others who ignored my requests completely. *I was starting from ground zero with no real friends or phone numbers, so I had to be a little forward about it and* **not give a fuck**.

Yesterday, I didn't have anything to do after school. So I thought, why don't I invite some people to one of my favorite bars? I texted about 15 people, inviting them to this bar. About 8 people declined, saying that they had prior commitments/other bullshit, but I got about 7 positive responses. Within thirty minutes, the first of these guys start showing up, and I started greeting them. Within an hour, everyone who said that they were coming came. 

The group was an odd mixture of co-workers/acquaintances at my university/people from the local My Little Pony fanclub. But, everyone was pretty cordial and I introduced everyone to everyone. 

So, for the next two hours, we all drank cheap-ass beer and talked about lots and lots of random shit. Small talk sort of stuff, really. At the end of two hours, we were all kind of wasted and the meet was starting to wind down. I called for the bill, everyone contributed what they thought was fair, and I gave a $6 tip to one of the barmaids. 

Then, one of my co-workers (we'll call him Chris) said to one of my university buddies (who we'll call John), ""You are a funny motherfucker. I'm glad I met you tonight. What's your number? We should hang out more.""

With that, everyone started exchanging their phone numbers with one another. I was really happy to see that. 

We got up from our stools, and everyone present thanked me for putting this drinking meet together. **""We should do this more""** was the most common refrain I heard. From there, everyone started heading their separate ways (me and my university buddies stuck together because we were all taking the same train home). 

If I didn't text these guys, most of them would have been doing absolutely nothing at home or in their dorm rooms. *If you want to go from doing pointless Internet surfing every night and lamenting about not having a social life to a having an actual social life*, then you must learn the first rule: **Don't give a fuck and just call people**.

It's Saturday and lots of people are out with their SOs and babies, dogs and whatnot. This morning, sitting down at my little corner under new social surrounding, made me feel awkward, out of place. I caught myself moving lots in my chair and trying to hide.

Then my experience (yup, in not in my early 20s as you can see) kicked in and that voice that everyone has, and you young gals and guys are developing, told me: ""dude, nobody is watching you. Chill"".


I'm telling you all this because even when you think you have overcomed all those social pressures that WE put inside ourselves, never go away. We have to control them and reason with them. Social skills are that, a skill. An ongoing project. Keep the good work, smile lots, have a open body posture and enjoy your Saturday.

I have been working at a very diverse scientific institution in said large city (~2,000 employees and many volunteers) for just over three years now (I've worked my way up from an intern in one department to a part-time employee in a different department).  
  
Anyway, I have many acquaintances, not only from work, but also from those who have gravitated to this city from my old high school and college. I even have some 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cousins nearby.  
  
I often see my social circles from work at work-hosted events and I socialize with them and catch up with them and maybe even go out to bars with them afterwards. There are a handful of people from school/family/work that I have one-on-one coffee or lunch with every couple of months to catch up. I will, once a year or so, get invited to bachelor parties or weddings and meet the extended networks of these friends (some living far away, some relatively close by).  
  
At all of these events, I feel that I am very sociable. I constantly get compliments on the way that I dress. Some people are very impressed with how many people I say hello to at the bigger events (""You know so many people; how popular you must be!""). A girl that I had met who was associated with a bachelor party that I was at recently was shocked, *shocked*, to hear that I was single (I chose not to mention that I haven't been on a date in 4 years). I take the time to chat with as many people around me as I can at these events, and there is definitely a mutual enjoyment of company.  
  
Something is missing, though. I don't have any co-workers to eat lunch with or whose office I am compelled to drop by on a regular basis to see what's going on (or vice versa). I don't have anyone to call on the weekends to suggest we go out and do any of the countless activities in our city. I don't feel like I fill in any appreciable social role in any of the circles that I interact with.  
  
I *think* the reason is that I don't know what areas of knowledge or culture I am passionate about, or what hobbies I want to do on a regular basis. I *say* I like certain things. Take hiking for example. I always *say* that I'm interested in taking a walk up a mountain or exploring a national park, but I haven't actually done that in a long time, and no one has invited me out to do so. I don't particularly care, though; do I actually enjoy it, then? Same with photography (which I *say* I love pairing with hiking). Well, aside from Instagram snapshots from my daily life (which garner plenty of likes and comments from everyone), I haven't done much of that, either. Maybe I just like the *idea* of these things. Nonetheless, the role of these and other hobbies play in my life hasn't been much more than me talking to people about how I enjoy and want to do these things. My lack of interest is, I think, causing me to [secretly want nothing to do with culture at all](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ2w6L4YHnI&amp;t=132)! I think everyone who sees me as some sort of social mastermind would be surprised to hear that, though.  
  
I was compelled to write this after failing to suss out any group to hang out with for the 4th of July. I've been sitting at home in the suburbs all day listening to music, and watching tennis and baseball (and the hot-dog eating contest, of course). I will undoubtedly play down the fact that I didn't leave the house with my acquaintances, of course (like on Saturday, when I will be having coffee and catching up with someone who I haven't seen since January).  
  
I don't think there was a question there. What should I do in order to gain interests and/or form closer friendships like I see among my peers at work/in life?

And we've gotten pretty close since 2011 and chat like 5 hours a day.

We agree on almost everything, but its the narcissim of small differences. On the few things we do disagree with, we'll just go on for hours without either side backing down. From my side, I feel like I'm the rational one. I'm always looking for a compromise. Trying to say there is no real disagreement, or we're both basically right. But he keeps insisting that I'm totally wrong, and this gets me frustrated and angry when I feel like I'm 100% factually right. And I feel like I have a pretty good track record, especially when I'm confident. If IDK or I'm wrong, I have no problem admitting it. But I do hate admitting I'm wrong, when I know I'm right, just to make peace. And maybe thats a poor social skill. Although from my POV, I feel like I'm trying to be the nice guy, letting us both save face when I'm 100% right. And hes the one trying to force me to unconditionally surrender. 

Part of it is, we can't even agree that we're arguing. I say that we're arguing about x, and he says we're arguing y. SO we have a seperate arguement about the topic of the argument. I make very nuanced finessed arguements, and he always trys to strawman me, reductio ad absurdem, into a ridiculously extreme position, I keep denying. So I don't even know what each side is trying to prove or disprove. Its infuriatingly frustrating.

But the thing is, as humble and compromising as I feel from my POV, I actually do have a bit of reputation as a know-it-all who will  never admit hes wrong. And will wear the other side down till he cries uncle. From my POV, I have no desire to prove the other side wrong, I always feel like I'm the victim, that the price of peace is I have to admit to something I know is factually untrue. And apolgize for being right. Maybe thats a character flaw.  But I feel like the opposite, lying that black is white, 2+2=5 is no virtue. 

But if multiple people have expressed this opinion of me, then maybe its me not them. IDK I always feel like Im super-civil, disagree without being disagreeable, and always looking to say we're actually both right. 

Even when I'm hitting on a beautiful girl, I'll actually stop and get in an arguement with her, over some factual minutae, because I just have to correct every factual mistake. I'll be making a cringingly awkward attempt to flirt with a girl, she says one wrong word, and I just keep browbeating her till she admits I'm right. If its come to the point, where all my approaches on attractive girls that do miraculously lead to conversation, end up revolving around me lecturing them, then yeah maybe there is something wrong with me. 

And I don't feel humble since 99% of the time, when I go home to wikipedia I'll feel totally vindicated. And even angry at that person, for wasting my time, and arguing so hard, when I calmly and patiently explained to them how the facts were on their side. And even gentlemanly offer a 50-50 compromise when wikipedia says its 100-0. 

Is the solution to just admit I'm wrong when I know I'm right?

Be like Stanley Hudson from the Office to Michael Scott? ""Thats your best idea yet"". 

I actually find I get along with people best, when I think of myself as a retarded idiot moron freak. And actually when I first met this friend, I had hit rock bottom, and thought of myself as a retard. And I had the humbleness that comes with that. I only started making something resembling friends, when I became a retard.

Here's the situation:

3 monts ago, I got accepted to a 1 year internship at a Fortune 100 company. It's basically my dream job. I was told that if I do well, they might keep me after this 1 year period.

Here's the catch: There are 2 of us. The other guy is an outgoing, nice person. Yesterday, I got an ""unofficial"" information, that the reason why they hired 2 people for the same position is to see who's more suitable for a permanent position.

I'm afraid that won't be me. Even tough I think I'm more ""professional"" than him, his social skills are much better than mine. He was able to make friends, socialize, make connections, while I'm really poor at socializing in a new environment. I'm not an introvert, I'm just kind of shy, and I need more confidence. I also don't talk a lot. He's got a huge advantage here.

Being slightly better as a professional is not enough here. I need to improve my image as well.

I've got 8 months left, which is more than enough to turn it around. I know that I can do it, but I need help. Any advice would be really appreciated.",,False,,t5_2r275,False,,,True,t3_12jizv,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/12jizv/reddit_i_will_lose_my_job_if_i_cant_drastically/,

I get hurt easily when people make a joke to me. I take it personally when friends exclude me from things. I lie down at night thinking of things that are put downs to myself, such as ""oh you're not good enough"", ""why does your girlfriend like you? You're too self conscious and paranoid, you think she is cheating"", and always ""you're alone"".

Also, a big thing I can't stand, I am paranoid towards my relationship. I am that stupid, jealous, awkward and quiet boyfriend. I don't know what to say because my mind freezes, and it sucks because later I find that I wanted to say lots of things. It's getting to the point where even I can't stand myself.

 The main reason is that **I'M TOO FUCKING SHY**. Next year is going to be the last time I see this people regularly, and I  want it to to be an awesome year, so I can have good memories (which so far I have very few). Maybe have my first relationship.

Recently I realized how beautiful this girl in my class is, and I want to kind of start to talk to her, and become close to her and what not. I know she has a boyfriend, and though it makes me kind of sad, I can deal with the fact of just being her friend (DAE Friendzone xD). 

I know really few things about her, and so does she about me. So I though I could start talking to her, you know, casually. Over the years I've had several crushes, which is very normal. The problem is that when I like a girl, I barely get to talk to her, and when I do, I think about that ""Hi"" from her for days. But this girl, I've been trying to get her to AT LEAST know who I am. So this week I said hi to her some times, with actually good responses (it actually made my day when I made her smile **TWICE**). But it stops there, just some Hi's and that's it. I want to talk to her over Facebook too, but I think it might be too creepy from me to do so. Plus, I don't know what to say after a ""Good thanks"", and It would just end awkwardly. Plus, I'm not exactly good looking or athletic (I laugh too when someone makes fun of my ""muscles"", or my not so appealing face)

Another huge problem with me is that no one hears me when I talk because I talk too low, and frequently gets me into awkward situations.

What can I do? How can I start talking to her over Facebook without being creepy? How can I get new friends? How can I talk louder? What can I do to stop being less shy? Add whatever you think could be useful, I'm tired of being the dumb guy who stands around when people talk in groups, or sleeps in his desk when the teacher is not in class while everyone is socializing.

But my friends hardly ever drink (especially the girls) and they don't smoke at all so hookah is always a non-option.

Heres my problem: 

I don't get hyped all over everything. Whenever I'm listening to some social butterfly do their thing, they can even turn something like taking out the trash into an epic adventure, and since they they sincerely seem to feel excited about it, people always get excited as well. 

**And then there's me**... 

I go on a cross country bike race with my friends for a week
, get chased by wild dogs, risk falling off a narrow bridge at night into a river whilst on my bike whilst I can't even swim, help dragging some drunk fucks to their homes outside after dark but **NOT EVEN ONCE** do I feel like ""OMFG I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL MY (OTHER)FRIENDS ABOUT IT!"". 

Since I'm not really THAT excited about it all, people won't be either and I don't really want to portray myself as some epic adventurer while I'm clearly not, and decieve people about what I truly am.

**Yet** every time I hear someone talk about some mundane activity like it's slaying a dragon, I can't help but to cringe, cause I know it's something really boring blown out of proportion really bad by someone who's just really social.

So heres the **dilemma**:

1) Should I act all excited and giddy about shit that's really boring to me for the sake of the social contract? or...

2) Stay true to myself, and be - I just kIlled a bear with my bare hands, meh... - whilst the others can fuck themselves?

**TD;DR - Does the subjective experience matter really that much more than the objective experience? It doesn't seem...fair.**

I go to University, I talk to classmates as much as possible, and I try to never have a day off, when I just sit at home.  I try to talk to strangers, but it barely ever works, and I've met nobody in any of my classes that I have even a little bit in common with.  I'm older than the average undergraduate (23, so not too much), and I'm studying a subject which attracts the most socially awkward of people.  While I respect them for their intellectual achievements, they're not making very good friends.

Over the last several months, I've put everything else in my life on hold, and focused almost exclusively on developing social skills - grades and work are secondary to me at this point, and they're slipping because of it.  I feel like my actual social skills are relatively alright now, but I'm incredibly lonely, and I have very few friends.  The friends I do have are very social people, and I think they feel hesitant to introduce me to their own friends since I'm not quite on the same level socially yet.  I have no resentment about this - it's totally understandable, but it makes it very difficult to meet people.

I have all day off tomorrow, and I have no idea what to do with my time.  What can I possibly do that will allow me to meet new people?  I don't get too anxious, and I spend as much time as I possibly can outside the house, but I can't find any ways to meet people, or even just find people to have conversations with.  It seems like in general, people have no interest in talking to people they haven't already met... How do I start? One of the few things I haven't tried is going to a bar alone... The thought makes me nervous, and I'm not really convinced it's a good way to make some new friends.  I've posted ads on r/r4r and Craigslist, and never got a response.  I scour both every other day for people I could contact with little success, I'm not going to contact someone whose ad is nothing more than ""hey i want friend...""  I never got a response on any of the ads I did respond to.

There are no meetup.com groups for people my age since the University is such a central part of my city.  I tried a bunch of University clubs, but they were barely functioning, rarely held events, and were incredibly cliquey.  There are a few others I plan to try when classes begin again, but I can't do that for months.

What am I supposed to do?  It's just so unbearably lonely all the time.  Whenever I'm at home, where I live with a family of people who do nothing but bring me down, I feel that sickening feeling of a tightness in my chest all the fucking time, because I'm becoming so upset and worried over trying to succeed socially.

If jumping into conversations with random people right away is a little more than you can handle, try these steps to ease yourself into the water:

* **Set a goal.** This can be numerical (""2 strangers per day"") or something more loose (""I want to find out what people's favorite foods are""). The point of the goal is to get you talking to strangers... and then keep you talking to strangers. The goal you set should help you achieve flow.

* [Challenge 1: Make eye contact and smile!](http://redd.it/1d4148) Spend a day or two simply making eye contact and smiling with strangers as you go about your day. You don't need to say anything, just observe the effects on other people and on yourself.

* [Challenge 2: Ask a ""One and done"" question.](http://redd.it/1d98pc) Ask simple questions of strangers such as ""do you have the time?"" or ""do you know what the homework is?"" These questions are easy to answer and don't require engaging in a full blown conversation just yet.

I hope this is helpful to those who want to try talking to strangers!

Just a quick back story, to explain my situation.
I'm 25 male.
7 month ago, my girlfriend of 6 &amp; 1/2 years cheated on me with her boss.
It was a wake-up slap, that made me realize the depth of the social abyss I was in. I hadn't seen a friend for 4 months, I was chubby, I didn't have any passion except killing time playing video games.

I decided to change, So I took up improv theater, teakwondo, picked up my guitar again, started contacting my friends again, lost a lot of weight, started reading material on social interaction (how to make friends, no more Mr nice guy, The game, ...), updated my wardrobe.

For a while, the new life I was envisioning made all the effort worthwhile. Then, about 2 month ago, I got nearly suicidal, really depressed, had two instance where I just couldn't go to work or outside. From this moment, I started playing video games, stop going to my improv class (felt out of place since I was 25 and every one else was 18), started eating more and went to a therapist.

The thing I wanted was just a small group of friends with similar interest (especially music, since none of the guys I know like the same thing as I do) to hang out with. But every time I meet someone, we always just spend 1-1 time, I can't manage to build a group of friends. I try to mix the people I know together,but it's always a night of social awkwardness. I also haven't made a single girl friend, and I don't know how to, since my ex forbade me to be friends with any female for 6 years.

I don't want to give up, because as soon as I give up, I can forget my dream. But I also feel like I'm getting nowhere near my goals and I'm losing my motivation.

I read all these success story of people who went from being Milhouse to become Van wilder, but I'd like to really be able to talk to someone who achieved this transformation, to ask question, to understand the hard part, and maybe the tricks for getting through them.

It didn't quite come across as I was expecting it to but it did make me realize something.

I'm bored with myself. 

I don't feel interesting enough a lot of the time to meet people and usually have no clue what to even talk about. Some people can sit and talk about a subject extensively and seem to know everything there is to know about it. I can't seem to do that.

Yes I do have interests, but I just can't sit and talk about them. I like metal, video games, art, politics, crafting, makeup/beauty, all kinds of stuff. I just feel like I can't talk about my interests because I just don't think I'm knowledgeable enough about them. So I don't. Hence people find me boring.

I think this is LARGELY less of a knowledge problem and more of a self-confidence problem. Largely. I have always had a HUGE confidence problem, I know my first impressions to people show that I'm incredibly nervous and fidgety, insecure, and very unsure of myself. 

I really am very unsure of myself. It's true. I really don't know why though, in many aspects of my life, I'm non-confrontational, avoidant, and afraid. I don't say what I'm thinking because I'm deathly terrified of causing an argument. Why? I don't want to offend people. I think, if I avoid offending people, they won't criticize me.

I cannot handle negative criticism of me. It's funny, because I HARSHLY criticize myself all the time. Constantly. I am very hard on myself, but if someone else was hard on me, I can't stand it.

Soooo, that's the issue.

TL;DR Severely lacking self-confidence because I'm terrified of offending people, which in turn gives an impression of being boring.",,False,,t5_2r275,False,,,True,t3_1f4xi2,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1f4xi2/im_boring/,

Today I just came back from the recruitment fair at my university. Compared to where I was 5 years ago, the difference is, well... awesome. I absolutely KILLED it, whereas not long ago I would have been one of the awkward guys, overdressed and asking pointless questions while trying to get their resume on the pile. I didn't need to hand out any resumes because I made *real connections* there.

I used to have zero social skills. I'm sure lots of you can relate to my story. Maybe you weren't popular in elementary school, me neither. I had just a few 'mom-approved' friends. In high school, things turned really bad for me. I had a typical suburban mom, who was very suspicious of new friends and didn't like my old ones either. I got grounded for an entire year in grade 9, which was a big turning point as I fell into playing excessive amounts of online games. I got addicted to WoW late in high school which only further hindered my social development. University wasn't so great either. I spent first year in my room playing WoW. I spent second year mostly alone smoking weed.

By third year, I finally turned things around. I realized that social skills really are a skill, actually a set of skills, and not a god-given gift. I started small, I practiced, I got better. I was still really, really weird. I kept trying anyway. 

If I could pick one single bit of wisdom that marked the turning point for me, it would be this:

Do you ever notice how nobody really talks to you? Even perfectly normal people sometimes have only 1 person or 2 people who talk to them on a regular basis. Lots of people have zero, they just talk with whoever is around, sometimes nobody. But I realized that for most people its really nice to be talked to, and maybe the highlight of their day to meet a cool new person! Isn't it weird how we always expect the other person to take the initiative? Its silly isn't it? We feel fear about putting ourselves out there but actually for the other person it can make them really happy and we forget that.

Since then, I've resolved myself to always be the person who breaks the ice and takes the first step. You would be *blown away* at how many people are just waitingggg for you to make the first move. You might think you are ugly, or weird, or whatever, and thats why people don't talk to you. No, fuck no, its not. Its because people are all just as anxious as you! Nobody talks about it but there are enough anti anxiety prescriptions annually to cover half the Western population! 

Once you figure that out, the only other hard part is not making people feel creeped out. Honestly, its just getting your emotions right. Its one of those positive feedback effects, where the more you succeed the better you feel and the better you feel the more you succeed. Creepy happens when you act interested but feel scared. Smooth is when you act interested and feel good!

Other than that, I'd say definitely try and dress well and groom. That should go without saying but its important because it signifies to everyone around you that you give a fuck about yourself. Being a little bit selfish is powerful, and sexy. Just don't *take advantage* of other people, try and forge mutually beneficial relationships (which is just mutual selfishness, if you think about it).

Which brings me to today. Why is it that at the session today I landed personal contact details from every one of my target employers and a couple I didn't even plan for? It wasn't a manipulative formula or secret code. I just took initiative and I had a good time with them! Your damn right I put myself into conversations! I talked to them like real human beings, and doing that makes literally anybody feel good!

Super simple stuff. Hope that helps guys. Anybody can do it, you can do it.",,False,,t5_2r275,1360219608.0,,,True,t3_181woo,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/181woo/transformation_story_super_simple_stuff/,

It can be a daunting task, but here is some advice that you may help...   
Meeting new people when you are on your own is always difficult. When you are with a friend, (or a group of friends), the tension of speaking to a stranger seems to be lightened somewhat. Based on this, one piece of advice would be to find one friend that you already have, whether they are from the same area as you or not, and get them to come out to a bar or café with you. Use them as a kind of friendship wing man. Approach some strangers in an indirect fashion, (for example commenting on something you overhear in their conversation.) The two of you will then be able to bounce off one another, taking turns to have input into the conversation. If it starts to run stale, ask the text book questions about where they are from, what they do etc... If they appear to not be interested or become at all negative then leave them to it as you will obviously not want to be their friend anyway.   
If you can't find a friend to help you with this, then the only real solution left is to just bite the bullet and talk to strangers alone in the park, coffee shop or bar. Find someone sat  by themselves and just straight up say 'Do you mind if I sit here?' If they say yes, engage in a bit of small talk about where you are, what they do, interests and the like. As I said before, if they are someone who you could eventually be friends with, the natural chemistry should take over and things will flow, but don't be scared to push the conversation if it slows down a bit. Try and be a bit funny (even whipping out the most cringe worthy and bad jokes in a kind of ironic manner), but also genuinely interested in them, (people like it when other people care about what's going on with them, whether they know them or not).   
At the end of the day, and this is something that is quite difficult coming to terms to, if it all goes tits up and you get ultimately rejected, it's not the end of the world as you'll likely never see them again. What's worse, being dismissed by 49/50 strangers and then finding that 1 who you make a long term connection with, or spending the foreseeable future in solitude crushed by your self perceived lack of social skills? I know where I'd place my chips!   
As I said it's never easy meeting new people, but I hope this few little pieces of advice can help anyone here as you all seem like lovely people, and everyone deserves to be in a happy and productive group of friends, whomever they are!

Well I've never been any good at most sports and I've done some pretty idiotic things over the years, most of them when I was completely sober. To add to that, when I end up doing something stupid, I tend to be all self depreciating to lighten up the mood (about the only time I can make people laugh), but whenever I do this, my mates often take it up a couple of levels to the point where it just becomes hurtful. 

So recently, I've been working on being a bit more mature and careful lately, but then even I still screw up badly and still get called an idiot. This reputation that I've built for myself really makes it hard for me to make friends with new people without them formulating opinions about me based on what other people said. This has happened to almost everyone I've met the last two years. The thing is I can make friends with them and all but I find that whenever I do screw up, the people that I just made friends with bag me out as harshly as some of my friends. Also, I find that after a couple of weeks, its like there's nothing interesting I can talk to them about and that we can only have small talk and the **occasional** laugh.

So guys, how can I lose the reputation of being an awkward klutz? I really want to break out of this shell. I just want to be a happier and nicer person that doesn't have to worry about everyone laughing about them in front of me or behind my back.

I think the reason boils down to this: I'm not witty enough to give it back, therefore it is always one sided against me. The only things that come to mind whenever someone pokes fun at me are really hurtful and stupid responses that I can't say to them without ruining the conversation (you are fat, etc).


That is mostly the only area where I lack social skills, which is why people are kind of surprised about my reaction. As I get close to people, they tend to give me shit because I seem confident enough to take it. A normal person in my situation would be, but whenever someone does it to me I feel helpless because I have nothing to say back. It has gotten to the point where it makes me angry and alienates people. 


I'm not really asking how to keep people from poking fun at me, but more how to change myself to keep it from ruining my conversations.

I didn't have friends until this semester when I joined a small fraternity at my college (maybe the only way I can make friends is through a long, controlled process) and I've never had a girlfriend or even met a girl who seems remotely interested in me.  Some people tell me it's because I'm ""depressed"" or ""not confident"" but I think it's because I'm a weird fucking guy like every other ""aspie"" I know.  My friends make fun of me all the time and I can't talk to a girl without her thinking I'm a freak.

My friends have told me that I am indeed a weird awkward guy, they told me that when I asked them for advice (the only advice they gave me was ""BE CONFIDENT BRO"") and I admire them for being honest with me unlike everyone else in my life.  Still, I always end up being the butt of all the jokes, everyone teases everyone but I always take the worst of it.  I always need to hear about how I'm awkward and weird and I have funny mannerisms and I'm getting sick of it.  They'd stop if I told them it bothered me, because they don't actually want to hurt anybody's feelings, but at the same time they'd think I can't take a joke since they have no idea how fucked up my life is.  The girls who hang out at the house have fun with all my brothers but ignore me unless they want me to do them a favor, which is often.  Some of them are condescending towards me and talk to me like I'm a kid and I'll probably tell them to go fuck themselves if they try it again.

We've been hanging out with a sorority lately and the girls in it don't seem to give a shit about me at all.  I tried to talk to two of them at a party, one ignored me (""How are you doing?"" ""Good.""  ""Thanks for helping us set all this up."" ""M-hm."" *walk away* [that happens to me a lot]) and the other talked to me but all the stuff I was saying sounded fucking weird (it wasn't the wrong stuff to say but my word choice and voice patterns sounded really weird) and she seemed uncomfortable so I just backed off.  One of my brothers talked to her for half an hour and got her number and they're still texting today.  I can't even imagine connecting with someone like that or even being able to hold a conversation that goes anywhere.

At the age I'm at (20) if people don't respect me by and large it's almost cetainly my fault, I'm not a kid anymore.  If I can't earn the respect of others then I don't deserve to live the life that I want.  I'm pretty sure the problem is that I have weird mannerisms, people with Asperger's have awkward posture, voice patterns, gestures, and facial expressions.  I can look at a picture of myself in a social setting and tell it's off but I can't tell why.  A few people have told me that I have weird mannerisms but can't put their finger on what it is.  How can I change this?

[somewhat long and rant-y],brynnablue,72,18,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1e7278/my_partners_roommate_is_a_massive_asshole_and_i/,"I'm dating a really wonderful guy, but he comes with baggage. One of his roommates is quite possibly the biggest shitbird I've ever met. His main method of interaction with others is to belittle their intelligence, mock their opinions, and generally behave like a pompous blowhard. This is really getting to me, especially since my intelligence is the core of my self-esteem.  
For most of my life, I was convinced I'd never have anything going for me other than my smarts. I'd never be pretty, good at sports, artistically or musically talented, socially adept, funny, or have any other socially redeeming qualities. But goddamnit, I was smart. I could always be smart. Years later, I've gotten much better at making friends, keeping jobs, talking to strangers, etc. But I still base a lot of my self-worth on being not only intelligent, but intellectual.  
Roommate (we'll call him Hank) seems to base his self-worth on ""showing up"" other people by proving them wrong. While he has proven himself to be capable of civil, even pleasant conversation, he rarely chooses to behave as such. I am not the only one who believes it's a choice; those who've known him for many years agree he is quite conscious that he's an asshole and revels in it. Hank enjoys getting people's goat; his eyes light up and he does this snide little chuckle whenever he feels he's gotten the upper hand in a situation.  
This isn't the only reason I can't stand the guy, though. Hank owes my partner a lot of money and has taken advantage of his goodwill for years. He is thousands of dollars behind on rent, regularly lies to my partner about work he was supposed to do around the house, and probably puts away a handle of Jameson a week by himself. He's always a bigger asshole once he starts drinking. Hank has only had one serious girlfriend, and every other girl he's ever slept with has only done so when massively drunk. Hank has been known to fondle drunk girls when they are blacked out/ passed out. He also has no concept of personal space or media etiquette. Case in point: both I and my partner have trouble following multiple conversations at once, so if we're trying to watch TV, we can't focus/ miss stuff if someone is talking. Hank knows this, and we've asked him not to talk during TV/movies multiple times, but he does so anyways. Hank also doesn't seem to care if you're trying to be snuggly or have a private conversation - he'll just walk up to you and start talking, and has been known to sit way too close to people trying to make out a little at parties and just stare at them. He always looks really creepy (I am not the only one who thinks this.)  
Hank and I really don't get along. We have both expressed extreme distaste for one another, though he's gone much farther than I have; he recently said ""I hate you and you need to die,"" quite seriously, after I had been going out of my way to be polite and not provoke him. Then again, I did once say something along the lines of, ""Y'know, Hank, I've been unfair to you. I expected you to be capable of having a polite conversation without acting like a massive asshole. This was clearly an unfair expectation, and I'll try to let go of it in the future."" Everyone who's known him a long time agreed that would've massively chapped his ass - indeed, he didn't say a fucking thing to me for the rest of the evening.  
I am not really a very nice person deep down. I want to figure out what makes Hank tick; I want to discover and map every little cog, button, and lever, and then use that knowledge to completely destroy him psychologically. I want to leave him so utterly miserable with his existence he will never want to be around me again, and will move his bloodsucking ass out of my partner's house and perhaps become a contributing member of society for a change. I want to surgically remove whatever capacity for happiness he possesses and leave him even more pathetic and alone than he already is. But I know this is the wrong thing to do, and that I should instead find a way to get along with him as much as possible. How can I do this?

I wanted to ask for some advice/thoughts/comments/opinions on an odd dilemma I have. I can normally have conversations with people &amp; have long amounts of time of social interaction. The weird thing is is that sometimes I feel like I'm being socially awkward around different people.

Example: I have people that I can talk to no matter what &amp; pick up a conversation easily. There are others though that when I talk to them I feel as if they almost don't want to talk to me, &amp; for some reason, the second I get this feeling I sort of tense up &amp; become socially awkward. By that I mean I hold weird conversations in that I'm not as confident as I normally am. 

It makes me feel like I'm being shut off &amp; that does make me feel bad. I can talk to them but it'll be short random blurbs that don't last longer than 30 seconds. This also kind of upsets me because I'll go &amp; see say that same person talk to someone else sometime afterwards &amp; I won't pick up that same ""I don't want to talk to you"" vibe that I felt when I was talking to them.

I don't know if it's just me overthinking it &amp; making myself crazy over nothing. (I have some self-esteem issues &amp; a pretty low sense of self-worth, so I do tend to think of myself negatively sometimes &amp; I get occasional fits where I think no one likes me. Which I know is not true.) This just bugs me because I don't want to be remembered as that socially awkward person that they knew.

Advice/help much needed!,anxietythr0waway,58,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/145m5x/urgent_help_needed_longtime_recluse_m25_with/,"Alright Reddit, major help needed here pronto.

Here's the deal: I'm a 25 year old male with some rather severe anxiety disorders.  I was diagnosed with social anxiety 12+ years ago and have lived with varying degrees of it ever since, but after a long-term relationship ended suddenly and harshly about 6 years ago I've basically become a recluse, isolating myself from everyone and almost never hanging out with friends, going out on dates etc.  Not surprisingly, 6 years of nonstop social isolation made my anxiety significantly worse and it built up to the extreme and constant level it's at now.

Now that you've got the history, here's the current situation, and the one I desperately need help/advice with.  About a month ago a girl in my area found me online, seems *really* into me, is extremely eager to meet up ASAP.  She's my age, sweet, attractive, seems to share a lot of my interests.  I live about 30 minutes from her but have been making excuses for the past month as to why we can't hang out (she knows I have some anxiety, but I haven't admitted the full extent of it to her).  Except, unlike in the past when people have tried to hang out or go on dates with me, this time I've actually planned to really meet her at some point, when I'm ready (or even half-way ready), both because I like her and because I really want to try and overcome my anxiety.  But I'm not ready yet...I'm still a nervous wreck, have panic attacks even when I'm alone in my room with nothing but my own thoughts to trigger them, and I'm just as terrified as ever at the prospect of meeting up with this girl.

So here's the big, pressing issue...last night she wanted to call me and talk to me for the first time (I *hate* talking on the phone and am almost as scared of it as IRL conversation) so, just to prepare for that I took a fair amount of anti-anxiety meds and when I was still nervous I added a bunch of alcohol into the mix to try and calm my nerves even more.  Pathetically I still didn't have the guts to talk to her on the phone after all that and made up some excuse about not having minutes on my phone, but since she was really upset about this and I felt awful and guilty, in my drunken/drugged stupor I promised her I'd make it up to her by meeting up with her today, pinky swear, no backing out etc etc.

So now it is the morning and I am sober and she is texting me wanting to know when we're going to meet up today and I am in full panic mode.  I can't make another excuse or just disappear (can I?) so I have no idea how I'm gonna make this work.

My biggest concerns:

1. Meeting up with her and having an anxiety attack...we're talking sweating, shaking, stuttering, maybe even vomiting.  This thought terrifies me.

2. Conversation.  I'm *okay* with conversation via text, IM, e-mail etc, but over the phone or in real life, forget about it.  I foresee many awkward silences and me not know wtf to say, or being too afraid to say something, or saying something ridiculous and inappropriate instead.

3. She wants to meet up at her place.  She has 8 roommates.  So now I'm not just dealing with 1 person, I'm dealing with 1 girl I barely know and 7 total strangers.  And it wouldn't be just one person witnessing my awkwardness and/or meltdown, it would be 8.

4. Judging by her voicemails and e-mails, she's almost certainly going to ask me to stay the night.  This makes me even more uncomfortable because it is impossible for me to sleep anywhere other than my own bed (another dumb anxiety trait) and awkwardly laying next to her all night wide awake sounds terrible.

5. Speaking of spending the night...**sex**.  She probably wants that to happen.  She definitely wants *something* to happen.  I have a perfectly healthy libido, an overactive one really, but it always takes second place to my anxiety.  About 5 years back I did something WAY out of character and forced myself to go meet with a girl at a hotel...she was really into me and had been for a while, I was super excited about it on the way, but when I pulled into the parking lot dread washed over me and it was nonstop anxiety from then on.  I was nervous as hell when we met, tried to pretend I wasn't, and before I knew it she was all over me.  Long story short, she took off my pants and what should have been awesome was mind-numbingly embarrassing since my anxiety was so overwhelming that getting an erection was just about impossible.  I'd had one the entire day just thinking about it, but when it came time...""NOPE.""  I had zero problems with this in my first few relationships (before the anxiety got bad) but that was mostly because I was familiar with them and felt comfortable around them.  Although I like this girl, I don't really know her that well yet and it would probably take a LOT for me to be truly comfortable around her or anyone else at this point, and until that happens I'm almost positive I won't be able to perform sexually in any way...and if the time comes, I have no idea what to do.  As a girl it would be pretty easy...""no, I'm not ready yet"" or something along those lines, but coming from a guy this sounds ridiculous and would make me even more uncomfortable about the whole thing and all interactions from that point on.

So far the only solutions I can think of for these 5 concerns are...**(1.)** Anti-anxiety meds...but those make me stupid, slow, and would really fuck up the second issue (conversation) since they turn all the creative parts of my mind to mush while they're working. Other than that, no idea. **(2.)** No idea **(3.)** Somehow convincing her to meet up somewhere else (?) **(4.)** Somehow convincing her to not stay the night (?) **(5.)** No idea

Can anyone offer any help?  Either help with the 5 things or just for this whole situation in general.  I'm not unintelligent, but my brain is so clouded by anxiety that I can't come up with any solutions for any of this on my own other than ""run away/avoid it.""  Oh and if someone could provide help in the next...errr...6 hours, that would be great.  I'll keep you all posted as this develops.

I'm a smart guy, but I tend toward introversion and am learning that I come off a little geeky in conversation.  I've always gotten along with people that I work and go to school with-- multiple people have told me I'm the funniest person they've ever met-- but I can count on one hand the number of times I've been invited to a party or other non-work function.

I think part of the problem is that I come off as a ""goody two-shoes,"" which in all fairness is probably true.  Aside: I was raised very religious, always tried to follow the rules, was nice to a fault.  I've never done drugs, and I didn't drink alcohol until about a year ago.  I don't think I ever came off as judgmental; if anything, I was objectively curious.  No one has ever tried to give or sell me drugs; feeling ""out of the loop,"" I once asked an ent coworker why that was.  She said something about how I just didn't look the type, or I didn't have the right aura, or whatever.  I honestly don't have any idea how to buy drugs, and I feel a little embarrassed about that.

So now I'm getting into my mid-twenties (still in college) and I want to know what it's like to go wild.  I'm approaching people and trying to build my confidence and social skills.  I've been to a nightclub on two separate occasions (those still seem like a social minefield to me-- anyone have a guide for absolutely clueless people?  And how do normal people afford to drink there?!) and I really want to start going to house parties and such, but I don't even know how to get in.  It seems like you have to know someone to get into a party, and I can't meet anyone unless I'm already a partier.  It seems like the old ""entry level job requires experience"" schtick.

I keep talking to everyone I can in classes, trying to make some friends with connections (I'm sure I fuck up a lot, but practice is good, right?).  I met a cute sorority girl and (clumsily, I'm sure) hinted that she should invite me to a party sometime.  ""Oh, you wouldn't like our parties,"" she said.  ""We just drink and drink way beyond responsible limits.""  So...?  I'm sure I couldn't keep up, but that sounds awesome!  Why am I coming across as anti-party?

The only other thing I can figure out is that I come off as too serious, before people get to know how silly I really am.  I've been told that my neutral face is very intense; I'm trying to smile more and be aware of what my face is doing.

Oh, and I imagine that some of the advice I might get is to invite other people to things first.  I do this, mostly to go get food or see a movie or something.  I haven't thrown any kind of party of my own because I don't think enough people would come to make it worthwhile.  At this point almost all of my ""friends"" are just classmates that I see on campus and study with.

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text; I just find this whole situation very frustrating.  I keep reading about how easy it is to go to parties and pick up ladies and what-have-you when you're in college, and I'm finding it absolutely mystifying.  It's like I'm missing some crucial social-sense, and it's driving me crazy!  I hope some of you other internet-dwellers have figured it out better than I have and can translate for me.  Thanks for any help.

I just moved to a new state for school about 10 months ago. Since then I've been in classes and have a part-time job, but have met *no one*. I'm talkin' squat, diddly, not a soul for a friend. I haven't had a conversation in months. I live with family, but they don't care about me (different story for a different day.)

Needless to say, I'm **fucking lonely.**

Where does lack of social skills come into play? The thing is, I'm trying hard to meet people. I have a bit of Social Anxiety, so it's hard to work up the courage to talk to people. But when I do say something, no one listens. To me it seems like they think that they don't have to listen because they don't want to be my friend.

Point is this: **I have no clue how to talk to people.** I'm pretty sure I'm a really boring person.. I don't have anything to talk about. I don't have any hobbies. I don't know anything about pop or alternative culture. I find it hard to follow fads... I'm a fucking retarded person basically. Socially retarded literally. How can someone even enjoy a conversation with me if I have nothing to contribute? Well, let me tell you: They don't.

I almost cried today at work. I was (poorly) attempting to have a conversation with a coworker when another person walked up. All of a sudden, they began talking as if I wasn't there. **Like, Fuck.** Is this really what my life has come to? I'm fucking invisible? No one likes me, *literally*?

Sometimes I contribute it to the fact that I am weird looking. Not ugly, just weird. People have been making fun of my appearance since I preschool, so I usually think that is why no one wants to talk to me. People like normal; I am abnormal.

Anyway, so I try not to wallow in self-pity, but today's events really pushed me over the edge here. I'm just now starting to realize that I and my life have been like this since I was a child. At this point I am just tired of it.

Avoid yes/no questions. Your questions should be open-ended.  ""Got any family in the area?"" would be a poor question, but ""What do you do for fun?"" is good.  

**Silence**  
When you ask a question, be comfortable with silence.  If you rush to fill the silence yourself, it cancels the pull the other person would feel to answer the question.  Just wait and have confidence that the other person will answer.  

**Sandwich questions and stories:**  
If somebody gives you a one-word answer, don't follow it up with more questions.  That just seems try-hard.  
Instead, answer your own question and tell a story about yourself.  
""What do you do for work?""  
""I'm unemployed.""  
""Sorry to hear that. I couldn't find a job, so I wound up going back to college. Now I'm taking a class in Web Design so that I can get a job that lets me travel.""  
Pause to allow the other person to relate.  If not, ask another open-ended question.  
""So where would you travel, if you could go anywhere?""  

The more you tell about yourself, the likelier they are to find something to relate to.  

**Free-associate:**  
Each new subject of the conversation can have nothing to do with the one before it.  Think of a stand-up comedian: they go from one unrelated joke to the next, but we really don't care.  You can do the same thing.  
If you're having trouble thinking of what to say next, just start free-associating mentally.  When you come up with something, just blurt it out!  You'll make mistakes along the way, but as long as you learn from those mistakes it shouldn't be a problem.

I don't want this second semester of my Freshman year to end up like the last one. I'm afraid to even unpack, I just put some of my clothes away and now I'm sitting here typing this. I hear people out in the halls going out to the co-op to buy their books, meeting each other for dinner, etc. It fucking sucks. Over break I told myself that this semester I would be confident, I would try to talk to as many people as possible and get back to and be even better than I was before. 

Moving in the fall of last year was fucking awesome. I met up with the guys I met during orientation, made a lot of new friends, went out and did fun stuff together, and generally had a good time for the first month or so. I had a (what I now see as) unhealthy relationship with a girl from back home that we were trying to work out long distance, and as things between her and I got worse (lessening communication, me putting in too much effort, insecurities on both our parts, etc.), this started to affect my social life. 

Halfway through last semester, I went to go visit this girl and she dumped me that weekend because I had became way too clingy, insecure, and emotionally attached in the long distance relationship, and we had an emotionally draining breakup that left me depressed with no self-respect. I made the horrible mistake of basing all my happiness in her rather than in myself, and I'm still recovering from that. Now she's joining a sorority, in tons of clubs, and I can't help comparing myself to her. The saddest part of all is that she KNOWS how pathetic I am, I feel like the only reason she wants to be ""friends"" with me is because she feels guilty for dumping me the way she did. She even offered that I should room with one of her friends next year who goes to my school because I don't have a roommate selected, which is a nice offer and I appreciate it, but it makes me so insecure in an area of my life that I never was before. Going into college I never expected it to end up this way. I used to always be confident in myself with whoever, and all of a sudden I found myself staying alone on the weekends, crying. I stopped hanging out with everyone besides my roommate, and I eat half my meals alone. I try to reach out to the old guys I hung out with at the start of last semester, but they live across campus and whenever I do I never feel wanted, and I KNOW that it's just this new insecurity that I've developed from my shitty break-up, but I can't help it and it hinders me from really reaching out to people and being myself. The only people I feel truly comfortable with are the guys from back home, and while it's awesome that I have a tight nit group of friends when I go back to my hometown, I want the same sort of thing here. I hate feeling pathetic. 

**tl;dr I feel like I've missed a huge opportunity in my life to branch out in college, in joining clubs, making deep friendships, and going out and just making memories and having a good time. I'm super afraid that this semester is going to end up like the last one, with me feeling alone and pathetic. I can't handle going through that again.**

How the fuck do I get out of this rut that I'm in? Thinking about it just makes it worse. 

**EDIT: Thanks everyone for responding! I'm reading all your posts, and I'll get to responding to each of them individually soon enough, my day has been emotionally draining and I need to rest for tomorrow.

**--François Marie Arouet**

I've just graduated high school and socially, I'm no better off than when I started. Going into high school, I had one friend. Throughout the years it had blossomed into a small group, then to a fair sized group, and then a fair sized group without me. Near the end of my senior year I started hanging out with a different group of people.

Looking back on it all, I was awkward as fuck. You know those John Hughes teen movies that always have that ""epitome of nerd"" role? That's me. Sometimes when I wouldn't hear people right I would either say ""Huh?"" or ""Excuse me?"" a lot. Maybe it made me sound overly-sensitive. Every conversation with me would be filled with tension. To top it off, I was clumsy and disorganized. I would trip and I would drop things, but it was never that simple to pick stuff up. Shit would fly everywhere and it would be a scene where more than 5 people would have to help me pick everything up. This happened on average, twice a week.

I even looked like a nerd. My family doesn't buy clothes, so I wear the random crap we had since the 80's. I *literally* looked like the nerd from those John Hughes movies. My senior year I bought some new clothes because I simply couldn't handle standing out like that anymore.

**TL;DR My entire high school career was one long-ass awkward moment sprinkled in embarrassment and dusted with pity.**

Lately after working each day, I usually end up going back to hotel and reddit, etc. It's already my 10th day and it's getting dull. I tried asking r/japan but no luck there.

Anybody have experience just meeting up people in foreign countries?

I have been working on my social skills and now I am able to fake interest when talking with people and get them to enjoy talking with me, but then I feel like a dick because I never want to talk with them again after meeting them because they interest me so little, and I was only acting interested in the first place. I can fake it again the next time I see them, but at that point they know something is off since I don't bother with finding them online or texting them or whatever. I can do those things but again I feel like a dick since it isn't sincere. I may even enjoy talking with them the first time but subsequent conversations always feel like a chore to me. This mindset leads me to avoid interacting with new people so I don't have to deal with faking my personality.

Obviously the depression is a huge contributing factor but assuming the worst case scenario of it being a continuous problem for the rest of my life, what can I do to increase my interest in other people? How can I increase my desire to form stronger bonds without having to put on a mask to get by? 

TL;DR: When someone says ""Hey man, hit me up sometime"" I want to be able to enthusiastically say ""Yeah, for sure!"" and mean it instead of enthusiastically saying ""Yeah, for sure!"" and thinking ""that's never going to happen"".

I'm not very socially gifted. I don't have many friends, and only one really deep friendship. I'm in college with plenty of opportunity to meet new people and I often do, but that's not the issue. I can greet them and talk about similar interests, but I have trouble forming a bond over that conversation. I have trouble giving off the message that I'm a fun, interesting, rewarding person to be around.  

I'm a great person to talk to about serious things. But of course, that's not what people want to talk about most of the time. I'm horrible at being funny, engaging, and generally making people want to be around me when they want to have a good time. Talking about music or tv shows is one thing, but there's a *way* to talk about them that makes the conversation rewarding that I don't know. 

With my current friendships, I have the problem where things get quiet and dull when it's just me and one other person hanging out and I'm mostly ignored when I'm in a group. 

There's no quick trick, some flip of the switch that can fix this, but do you have advice on what I can do to go about fostering a better sense of fun that I can share with others?

Basically, nothing interests me in any conversation I have with other people. I could not care less how their lives are going (harsh, I know), or what they're up to. I'm also very inattentive and will not notice anything that's changed about a person, no matter how dramatic it is (recently met up with my ex... did not realise that she had cut her hair short until she asked me how different she looked and I couldn't answer... that was awkward *shudders*). 

Also, I'm at that level of geek where I find things like quantum physics/string theory and computer hardware interesting. However, unlike most of the people I know mildly interested in either of these, I do not like superhero's, comics, RPG's, MMO's, Sci-Fi, or even books in general (yeah, stereotypical geek I know, but that's just how it is). 

I'm so out of sync with the news that I didn't even realise we had a change of Prime-Minister until my step-mum asked me of my opinions on it (to which I replied ""We did?"" and she laughed). I only know various names of celebrities, but have no idea who they are or what they've played in movies or whatever. The closest to 'household names' I know about are some english comedians, which doesn't really work in Australia. Also some poker-stars, but literally no-one I know is interested in poker. I have not followed any sports in years. I do not know the names of the songs I listen to; I just listen to music mixes and podcasts (it's very awkward when the best answer to ""What songs do you listen to?"" is ""The one that starts 15 mins into GoingQuantum podcast #27""). 'Art' pisses me off to the point where I wish to avoid it as a topic at all costs. 

I haven't done anything particularly interesting in my life, always been forced to stay in and study like crazy (thanks mum). I've tried making up stuff that I've done before, or even just exaggerating things, but it's so inherently against my nature. I hate saying things that are incorrect.

As a result of all of this, I find it very difficult to maintain a conversation with anyone for more than a couple of minutes. I've tried feigning interest in their ramblings, but it's all just too tedious and I lose track of what they're saying. 

Halp plox... I don't even know where to start. I don't care enough about socialising to change who I am, but I have a feeling that it's really going to affect things like job opportunities and other important shit like that in the future if I don't get to practise talking to people that often.

Thank you all for my article on networking being quite successful yesterday, much appreciated.

How To Have Deeper Conversations &amp; Relationships With Anyone

One of the greatest accomplishments over your lifetime will always be how well you connected with others and left a lasting impression with them. Yet for so many people it seems so difficult to connect or bond deeply with those that surround them. How do we break through the small talk and really get to know people for who they really are?

Let's quickly get past the opener. This, to some extent, is going to be the usual. ""Hey, how's it going?"" or whatever variation, is going to be just fine. If you start out, they're likely to say something along the lines of ""Good, you?"" If they started it out, then good, either way we've arrived now to the same point. Quick note: if this is while passing by and you both are going seperate ways, not a great time to try to continue on. Best to let it end with a simple response. This is for all those other times, when there is opportunity.

Break it down into four key components: topic, grounding, transitioning, and content.

The topic is going to be what you wish to talk about. This should be something considered interesting to most people, something you are quite knowledgeable about, and very much considered a strength of yours. Let me pick two that we will use for examples here: movies and music.

Grounding is where you are supplying the reason you are going to talk about a certain topic. This is where you say a little bit of what you've got going on or are thinking about currently.

Transitioning is going to be the art of smoothly making that happen. This isn't all that difficult when you've got it planned out in advance, like we're doing right now. (With time this will come naturally as well.)

So, for example (After the ""Hi, how are you?""):

Movies: ""Great, just watched Silent Hill 2 last night. What a messed up ending, I'm still confused what exactly they meant with it. Have you seen any good movies lately?"" Even if they say no, have an easy follow-up such as ""Well what kind of movies do you usually like?""

Music: ""I'm doing good, just got a song stuck in my head right now. Do you listen to the Deftones at all?"" Even if they are to say no, have a smooth follow-up like ""Really? Well, what kind of music do you listen to?""

Stay interested and pay attention. Try to notice threads along the way that can help you either continue the conversation further or change the topic before it dies out. If their response for movies was ""I like watching movies derived from comic books like Spiderman, Avengers, Batman..."" you can choose any of those movies to continue on with, comic books, or even ask what is it about superheroes that fascinates them.  I think the deepest one is quite obviously that last choice.

That leads us to content. You want to dig deeper. You don't really need to know every single movie or band they like. What you want to do is get past these surface-level what's and get to the how's and, even deeper, the why's. Any female is likely to tell you they get bored with the same old questions like ""Where do you go to school? What's your major going to be?"" But how many people ask them why they chose to major in that area, or how does it connect with their passionate side?"" These are the questions that will get them thinking, feeling... interested.

So there's quite the secret weapon right there: the how's and the why's. Now let's go over your five best topics that will have you connecting with people on a much deeper level (F.O.R.D. + W.), and a smooth ground/transition to use them:

F) Family - Should be obvious that most people have deep connections and feelings with their family. They usually love to talk about them.

Example: ""Doing alright, just thinking about some drama going on with my sister right now. Hope she's doing ok. Are you close with your family?""

O) Occupation - Their job/career. This could also be about what they wish their career was as well.

Example: ""Doing great, work's been crazy lately. So much going on. Where do you work at?""

R) Recreation - Their hobbies and things they do in their spare time.

Example: ""Good, definately doing good. Just was talking to a buddy of mine about getting a bowling team together and joining a summer league. What kind of things do you do on your time off?""

D) Dreams - This could be interpreted in two ways: what they dream about when they sleep, or what their dreams are to become. I prefer finding out what their dreams are to become, it's usually a very deep conversation that ensues.

Example: ""Great, just been spacing out a little bit here on possibly taking a couple courses on programming, lots of good money to be made and I think I just might actually enjoy it. What kind of life would you choose if you were to start all over and do it again?""

Lastly, my absolute favorite topic. I feel it's the best way to break barriers and get people to realize you should become a part of their everyday lives. I wouldn't recommend this immediately upon meeting someone, but after you've broken through that outer shell and bonded for a little while.

W) Week/Weekend - When you ask them what their plans are on their upcoming days off, they're suddenly seeing a correlation between you and the possibility of hanging out sometime. You haven't imposed anything yet, but if they do like you, and they should by now, they're likely to invite you to join them or hang out in the near future. This is also your opportunity to invite them to something. So here we go...

Example: ""Great, getting kind of psyched to hang out with an old buddy tomorrow that's back in town. How about you, you got any good plans coming up this weekend?""

Ok, so there you have it. I recommend you don't lie in order to ground and transition. Just find any type of correlation between the topic you wish to choose and anything recent with you or soon to come. You also don't need to reinvent the wheel. You can use the same ground/transition on 20 different people and it's highly unlikely they're ever going to compare notes. Be original when you can, and fall back on your usual transitions when you can't think well.

Very quickly, some key components that will help you receive better reception from people you're talking to:

1. Positive body language
2. Be down-to-earth (no egos)
3. Have a strong voice
4. Be interested in them and what they have to say, but not needy in any way, shape, or form
5. Let the conversation be a 50/50 thing, you both share back and forth
6. Be empathetic (the more they feel like you relate to them and the way they think, the more they will like you)
7. Keep things positive (this includes avoiding topics likely to get negative such as religion or politics)
8. Make sure the things you say about yourself are portraying good qualities about you
9. Have fun, don't pressure yourself, you don't do well under unnecessary pressure (most likely)
10. Take note of their interest level. If they are in a rush, look to end the conversation well

You will soon learn a lot about this person, as they will about you. You will easily be able to start back up conversations like you do with your family and closest of friends. This is how it's done. This is how you make a strong and lasting impression on the people you meet.

So here is my situation:
I´m 17 years old, from Germany and still go to highschool (I´d say this is the fitting equivalent, since I´m not from ´Merica)
I basically started becoming awkward with my discovery of the mighty MMORPG World of Warcraft, it went all downhill from there, I stopped meeting friends and started getting lost in this fucking game. I spent most of my time from the age of 11-14 ½ in this game, gave no fucks about my appearance and such. **I feel like this is a vital part, where I failed to learn  proper social skills**
Then we had a new boy in our class, who became my best friend for the next 2 years, I started participating in life again, we talked the same language, we had the identical humor and nearly everything fit, but due to the lack of social skills I was still awkward as fuck and depended on my buddy all the time. I did not try to expand my social circle and was very introverted when it came towards strangers and people I did not know well. **Found a buddy who got me back into life, but I was still awkward as fuck**
I than became a senior so I was no further in the same class as my buddy. Things started to get worse again, I made a shy and introverted first impression on everybody in my new courses and have a hard time recovering from that. My buddy made new friends and became aware of the fact that he is likeable and handsome. This lead to a change in our friendship, from a “Bromance” to a, what I would now describe as a normal/good friendship. **Became a senior, no longer in the same class as my buddy, he made up a new social circle, I didn´t**

That´s a quick summary how things have gone so far so my problems at the moment are:

**- I feel inferior to everyone, because...**
I´m nearly the youngest person in my grade, and there are plenty of people who are 1-2 years older than me
When I´m around people i do not know well and my bro is with me he gets most of the recognition, he is a natural I envy him for that, but it makes me feel inferior

**- I have a problem with finding new friends, because...**
I do not like the popular boys at our school, because they are mostly arrogant and unlikeable
The people i made new friends with in the past two years are also befriended with my bro, which often make me fade into the background
People I have not befriended yet are either the popular kids, the nerdy guys I would also not like to hang with and the semi-popular guys that hang with the popular kids

**- I feel not respected and insecure, because...**
I have almost no relationships to girls, which lowers my value in my social circle
I have a hard time getting to know people, i do not know how to properly conversations with people I´ve now ""known"" for almost two years, but never really talked to

**- Social Skills I lack:**
Leading proper conversations
Body language (My walking style looks really shitty, I walk very stiff and uptight, but also I think about the way I walk every time I DO walk)
Telling stories
Being open towards strangers/ friends of friends
Grabbing and holding attention of a group
Giving value
I feel the pressure to be liked by everyone (this pressure seems to change every few days, on good days it won´t be that big of a deal, but when I have a bad day its grows bigger and bigger)
→ If I do not get the reaction I want my self image starts

**Things I´m doing so far:**
Meditating
Playing football (remember I´m European! :D)
eating healthier
playing the guitar
reading lots of r/seduction and pick-up stuff
r/malefashionadvice
r/NoFap

**Things I´m failing trying to do:**
Smiling a lot, my face starts to feel clenched and it feels unnatural, what I than suppose is also the way it looks
Being friendly to people, I very often do not know what to say or how to come of well

I am not expecting any enlightening tips of you guys, i think my soul just wanted to share this shit and I feel better already. I´m also afraid of too much theory in relation to practice, which I think I already have. And for sure I´ve noticed some changes, but I am still not feeling good about myself most of the time. I would say 2-3/10 days I feel awesome, but still I depend too much on external circumstances, like reactions by people towards my actions (laughing, showing interest etc.).

I haven't had any luck making friends in the past decade.

In 2004, I was banned from a message board I used to hang out at a lot by some bad moderators.  I made no friends in college. It didn't help that I had to become a commuter student where I go home off campus at the end of the day.

In 2011, I was kicked out of a local hackerspace that I was interested in.  A shift in power at the organization and the will to keep a deceased friend's political ambitions alive in an organization more concerned about gaining their precious tax-free status on top of that being accused of threatening someone when I did not mean to sound threatening did not improve my social skills.

Then last year, I though maybe I could start over. Maybe I could make friends here on reddit, in my area.  It didn't take long to become a social parriah again.  I'm too embarrassed to go to any of the local meetups.

Add to that, I've been without a job since last year, and before that I was without a job for over 5 years. So basically I've been unemployed for the past six years.  With no money, no friends, no car, and no means to ""pull myself up from my own bootstraps"", I'm stuck.

Add to that, alopecia is setting in on my forehead.  I would have though that by the time I was 30, I would have got my shit together, but I don't have the means to do that.

Come the weekend, you could take the risk and go out with friends but it's so much more comfortable to surfterbate reddit and the webz.

But that's lame. And you realize it, you've reached that stage. But obviously you're still learning on how to deal with it because the irony of this subreddit is that it's located on THE INTERNET. But that aside, let me give a few words of advice to you about some of the unwritten rules of the social game that you should know.

**Dude to Dude relationships**

If you have a friend that's a asshole to you, that doesn't mean he doesn't like you. Actually that probably means he does. If somebody doesn't even acknowledge your presence, that's your signal that they want nothing to do with you. So next time you're out and somebody pokes fun at you, don't freak out, don't clam up. It's just a test of self-confidence, playfully tease back. Because in male to male communication it's not cool to show feelings all the time.

**Relationships with Women**

Guess what. Women have enough pussies in their life. They really don't need another one. If you're wondering why women aren't flocking to you, or don't seem to enjoy your company maybe your approach is off. Playing the nice guy isn't going to get you anywhere, women like to be teased just as much as your guy friends. You have the upper hand on women, you decide when they are welcome to go on a date with you, whether or not you take them home tonight. The battle of the sexes was over way before you were born. It's your fucking job to start acting like it.

Stop pretending that you're anything less than you are. It's not doing yourself or anybody else any good. In order for the party to get started, somebody has to be the asshole to make it real. Have you ever been in a social situation when nobody teased anybody? It's so painfully awkward to tip toe around peoples feelings. Now don't get me wrong and stomp all over people. That's called being a dick, there's a difference.

You have one life to live. Right now. Today. So stop apologizing for what you're going to do with it. Take what you want, because failing isn't the end of your life; however, your life won't be worth living if you don't go out and try.

i get what she's saying but i'm not sure whether or not i agree. do i tell her to ditch him and keep looking (because it's not exactly what she wants, and she's concerned for how much he actually loves her, and their possible future)? or do i tell her to try to be happy with how much he tries to show he cares and that things will get better? they're in their mid-late 20s, dating 4 years, employed, unmarried, living together one year. he seems perfectly happy.

edit 1: our group of friends discusses rational ways of approaching things, not just idle chit chat, and not complaining for complaining's sake. we go to each other for advice and outside opinions on the best way to handle situations, as well as figuring out if we are being realistic in our thoughts and actions. i was a little stumped by this one, having never thought about it (i'm happy or im not), so i came to reddit for the same type of help.

edit 2: we've all told her to make a pro/con list, and to talk to her bf. she wants to figure out what she's feeling, what to say, and how to say it, to be most effective in her discussion with him, instead of drawing it out like a huge fight until she figures it out mid-convo with him. none of us would like to see them end because of not talking or saying wrong things.

edit 3: **main issue that needs addressing** she feels he has it in him to take a deeper interest in her and their relationship, the same deep interest he shows in his pet and hobbies, she's just not sure how to draw it out of him, if, indeed, that's possible. i think this is the biggest part of the issue she's facing. it's the one thing i cant figure out.

Few years ago public speaking was a nightmare for me. I would get really anxious and nervous during it, my hands as well as voice would start shaking which would make me nervous even more, it was horrible. I was close to blacking out. I hated speaking in front of people. It wasn't a lot better on 1on1 interaction and eye contact.
So i worked hard to get rid of my problems, started with baby steps - spoke with sales assistants only few sentences, tried interacting more, keep eye contact with people I know or don't know. It started to get easier after some time but still I wasn't a person I wanted to be.
So this say was my first ever important presentation in not my language. It was about tourism in East Asia. I started preparing for it few weeks before. During my preparation I always had positive thoughts about it, such as that I will do it without any problems or without stuttering without shaky voice. Only positive thoughts and no negativity.
Started presentation and couldn't believe it i had no problems during It, my body language was great according to profesor, also he have said ei did really good with presenting and keeping eye contact. During presentation I got so proud of myself. I always wanted to talk in front of people without any anxiety and stress and it was finally happening. I started smiling at some point of presentation because of it. It's also a lot easier to speak with people without making it akward or without getting anxious.
Also it was first time that I spoke in English longer than I've ever had.
As for reason of this topic I don't know, I just wanted to tell someone about it. Remember you want things to change you have to work on it. If I havent done anything to fix my problems today's presentation would be horrible experience, but now it was awesome.

What do I need to know?,paralyzedguy,47,5,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/utk4z/im_a_highschool_graduate_trying_to_reinvent/,"(More background [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gmoqo/any_advice_for_a_highschooler_i_feel_useless/) if you want, but I'll summarize the essentials in this post). 

I see a monumental task ahead of me.


You'd be safe in describing me as your typical shy, introvert. I spent most of my life perusing solitary activities. When I wasn't studying for school, which took up most of my free time (it did pay off though), I was usually practising martial arts, reading books, gaming, or learning about photography (my new hobby). None of these activities are very social, and I didn't get out much. To keep this short, my social skills aren't where I want them to be and my relationships with women are non-existent. 

I've resolved to begin taking steps now so that I'll have a chance to reinvent myself, starting with the college summer school program that I'm starting in a few weeks. So far: 

* I'm working on my depression and self-esteem issues by reading [Intimate Connections](http://www.amazon.com/Intimate-Connections-David-D-Burns/dp/0451148452).

* I'm working my social skills by reading the classic how-to guide [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671723650) and by reading [this website](http://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/). 

* I've decided to join a few clubs/student groups in college, starting with the various martial arts groups and photography groups (so that I can get formal training) and working from there. 

Anything else that I should be looking at or work on?

I'm currently 20 years old and a 3rd year undergrad, but the incident in question happened in middle school.
In retrospect, I wonder if my (very) mild Asperger's made me clingy. I know - this story screams 'move on!'
Perhaps I haven't completely moved on. That said, the fact that my social neuroses still exist merits telling
this story.

Back in middle school I was friends with a group of kids I had known since elementary school. They were,
or so I believed, my closest friends. I would periodically invite them over for video games, pizza, and good
times. However, they seldom reciprocated - and often discussed openly gatherings to which I was not invited
in my presence. This bugged me, but not to the extent of cutting them off entirely. Fast-forward to high school.
My actual best and I were under the impression that we would be attending homecoming with them - they even
invited us! Nope - the day of I called only to realize that reservations had been made at a restaurant without us.

We had been kicked to the curb by people we thought were close friends. I was all sorts of pissed and hurt. I
cut them off entirely and found a new, and better, group of friends. Unfortunately, the scar of that incident still
remains.

Nowadays I always feel like the odd man out in social settings, even with my current group of close friends. I've been trying
to branch out, but I can't bring myself to initiate anything. At the same time, I lament the fact that of all the people
on my school's campus, only one initiates anything with me (it's a small school, no need to feel sorry for me). I'm
pretty sure the incident long ago has caused me to fear eventually becoming close with new people for fear of
getting hurt again.

Any advice for getting past this hurdle?

I've always been known as ""that chill but, kind of quiet guy"". I've always had to weasel my way into social situations because I don't know how the fuck to give value and make people enjoy my company. I've tried some things on here and other guides, but it comes off as systematic and forced.

I have a lot of friends and I'm in a fraternity. However, no one tries to make plans with me. I often have to force myself into events because that's the only way I can ever be included. Additionally, all of my friends are very socially competent, so it is hard to demonstrate value. Here's a typical situation that happened a couple of days ago:

My house (five guys including myself, we're all close friends), has become closer to these two (very attractive) girls. They are all very socially competent, which makes me go blank and sort of overshadows me, which takes away from me, even if I had a good speaking moment. One night, we got drunk with them and decided to head back to their place for hookah. I was mostly quiet and didn't have anything interesting or funny to say. As usual, my mind went blank. Looking back on that night, I kept thinking, ""Why can't I be like them? Why can't I captivate the attention of others? What the fuck do I talk about?"" I used to not give a fuck about these things, but I realized I was kidding myself - there's no such thing as the mysterious, quiet guy. If I want to win over people, I have to actually be someone. I noticed this through what happened the following day as a direct result of my actions:

I slept a little late that day and realized three of my housemates were gone. I texted one and he said that they went back to the girls' house just to chill and watch TV. No invitation there. I had two options: force my way in and ask if it would be chill if I hung out with them, or back down. I chose the latter, not wanting to barge in. Now, if I were interesting and actually had shit to say, that text would have been something along the lines of, ""we're at __ and __'s house, you should come.""

 * *Improve Your Social Skills* is a comprehensive online guide to social skills. It has over 50 lessons that cover conversation, body language, empathy, meeting people, making friends and more. It's written to be simple to apply and practical in all circumstances---unlike many guides that give vague advice or advice that is only useful in a few limited contexts.

 * I wrote *Improve Your Social Skills* to share what I've learned about social skills with the world. I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome ten years ago, and when I was diagnosed I learned that my Asperger's prevented me from learning social skills automatically. So I went out and studied very hard, and after a few years of study I found myself not only excelling in social situations but also having a deep understanding of the underlying systems and subtexts of social interaction.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to read other people's troubles and putting forth your thoughts. It really does mean something to those of us putting forth our issues. We may be pessimistic in receiving a solution to our problem, but your advice certainly puts things on the right path (or so I like to think).


Now, to what I wish to discuss - I am seemingly getting worse at interacting with people. This is a very subjective judgment, but from what I understand of efficacy, social learning theory, self esteem, and a number of other things I've learned about through being a psychology student, one of the main things that correlates rather well with being good at something (or even just not terrible..) is thinking that you can do it, and knowing that you can do it. I have lost this optimism with regards to relating to others. 


There was a time when I thought that my lack of getting along with others, or fitting in (two separate things) was due to 'just not trying enough'. However, I think that was me just trying to avoid the truth that I am just not as good as most other people. A fact I have found I am quite resolute in.


I feel lonely as fuck. Now, when I say I'm 'lonely as fuck' I do not mean that there is no one around me who cares about me. No, quite the opposite. But I feel lonely as fuck. It's not there aren't people around me who want to connect with me. They're there, just waiting for me to reach out and be 'that awesome guy that I know you are', or 'that funny guy I knew in school'. But that's not going to happen. I have had the same sense of humour (I feel anyway...) since likely grade 9, and no one finds it funny. And yet I make the same jokes over and over and over, making others uncomfortable, because I can't stand having someone tell me something and not make a comment back to them (rather than stand there in awkward silence). I don't know how to react. Sometimes I think I'm borderline autistic in these social situations.


I'm sorry, I don't even know what I'm having a problem with. I just know I can't connect with people, even I think I'm creepy as fuck when I talk to people; laughing at their jokes and have nothing to return. Listening to their stories and have nothing relatable to relay back to them. You know, how many guys just going out talking. They tell stories and 'pal around' with each other over a beer or game of pool, or watching sports. I enjoy all of those things, but absolutely fall apart in the talking bit. 


*sigh* I may as well talk about the other thing that is really bothering me lately too, and that is getting close with a girl. I know that one night stands or whatever is just not something I would be into. I want a relationship. I want to get to know someone, have mutual love between us, have fun together, traveling together, TALKING (which holy shit I cannot do!), coming home to someone who I know will not judge me...  ugh... how do you guys do it? How do you go out there and have fun with people? I feel like I don't even know how to have fun...


This is kind of all over the place, but if I start editing it will be reduced to nothing. Lots of things talked about above that are really really bothering me. And I feel silly even typing this out to be read, I can't imagine what it would be like to talk to someone irl about it. It's gotten to the point where when I read about social interaction in my psychology textbooks I immediately get really depressed and sad and jealous? of what I could have, but don't because I'm just not good enough to get out there and connect with people. I see many posts on here (reddit in general) showing silent people having many really deep thoughts but only communicating a very small amount of it. I don't have that. It feels like I have nothing to say...


I don't even know what I expect from this... But, again, thank you so much for reading. I truly do appreciate it.

When I'm socialising with new friends or acquaintances, there's a disconnect somewhere and I don't feel like I know if we're polite strangers or becoming great friends. I like them but sometimes I might just *want* to feel a connection with someone rather than it actually being present.
(I'm speaking platonically by the way; this isn't about flirting where it's not welcome.)

I alternate between over-estimating and under-estimating the level of friendship, depending on my self esteem that day. Overestimating causes awkwardness and people probably avoid me because I'm interacting under the assumption that we're closer than we actually are. Then sometimes I'll underestimate the friendship (""they're just being polite, they're only talking to me because there's no one else around"" etc.) so I try to back off to give them space and then later on I realise that this has offended and confused them. I'm worried that I accidentally reject people who I'm trying to befriend.

Is this a skill that I can gain with practice? I think the skill is more involved than simply a matter of reading body language (which I've tried to study a lot).

""they must have thought I'm really weird"" ""is that even an expression?"" stuff like that, so next time I see the person I feel as though they have this pre-conceived negative impression of me even though this is entirely based on an analysis I made of our conversation out of context.

Then, you get comfortable not caring about what people inescapable and significant think of you.

Since break began, I've sent them a text about once a week, letting them know when my work schedule allows for me to be social in the coming week.  

This was fine initially, as we were both realtively swamped with work and therefore unable to see eachother, however once the new year started I saw a dramatic cut in hours while they seem to have seen no change whatsoever.  This week we made tentative plans which fell through on their end due to life complications (understandable, completely) and they said that maybe we can try again next term.  

This is not in and of itself inherently problematic to me, I know that life comes up and causes problems and all that, but my concern lies in keeping communications open between us in the weeks leading up to the term.  My basic intent was to send them a ""how's it been going?"" text every once in a while (but I don't know how often is appropriate, more than once a week would be strange to me, but should I shoot more towards once a week, or once in two weeks?) to keep a friendly dialogue alive between us.

I need to vent and ask some advice on how to deal with them.,rastapasta808,51,16,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1gzgsy/my_roommates_are_very_immature_but_legitimately/,"So I live in a college house with 5 other guys and we get along for the most part but they are extremely ignorant of how they act.  They are very lazy and judge others when they arent doing the same thing theyre doing.

For example, when I was really busy with finals I stayed in my room and studied for a few days and only came downstairs to eat and watch tv.  A few of them took this personally for some odd reason and thought that I just didnt want to hang out with them or that I was being anti-social because they spend a lot of time together which I just dont want or need because I have my own set of friends who are self-assured.

When I would come downstairs, they would be watching tv and act like they didnt see me come into the room and basically ignore me which builds animosity on both ends.  Its like the by-stander effect where they all assume someone will say something so no one does.  And its weird because in that situation they are being cold and anti-social.  I dont get this.

Another thing they do is use subtle exclusionary tactics during conversations.  They REALLY like to exclude individuals to enhance their own brand so to speak and it just really reminds me of middle school behavior.  Like last night, we were drinking a bit and they began talking about something that happened to three of them but did not happen to the rest us.  They went off for at least 15 minutes about a topic we had no clue about and when we would try to ask what they were talking about they would literally ignore us and continue laughing and talking.  The one thing that made me lose **a ton** of respect for one of my roommates was that I asked ""So what happened exactly?"" and made eye contact with him while the other two were talking. He literally looked away and acted like he didnt hear me.  I kept looking at him and made sure he knew he stepped over a line with me.  It was a slap in the face.  I know they do not respect me as a person but Im ok with that because Ive never been a person who seeks validation from others but I just cant figure out why they need to make others feel this way.

I know they are insecure but thats just ridiculous.  I cant understand why they choose to act like high-schoolers who need to impress eachother because they  dont know who they are.

But one funny thing did happen last night that opened my eyes a bit more.  We got into a conversation about pointer- and index-finger length in relation to how much testosterone and estrogen a person has.  (stupid I know)  One of my roommates who acts like a tough-guy but is by far the most sensitive person I know looked at his hands and saw that he had the weird situation where his index was longer than his pointer.  The roommate who brought up the topic told him that he had a lot of testosterone and the tough-guy roommate puffed up his chest and grabbed his balls saying ""yea I knew it"".  Then the moment of clear insecurity sprung up.  The roommate actually had it backwards and told tough-guy that he actually had a lot of estrogen and that he was really sensitive.  Ive never seen someone shrink down so fast.  It was like everything made sense to him for a second and his act that he was putting up fell to the wayside.  I wanted to ask him ""So you are really that insecure that you let an meaningless fact determine how much of a man you are?"".  Sad, sad little man.

Anyway, I just needed to get that off my chest.  If you read this far I hope you can relate and maybe offer some advice on how I should handle the situation.

Tl;dr: Roommates are extremely insecure and cliquey and behave like middle-school girls who try to exclude people from their group.  They dont respect me as a person but I dont need their approval and would like to take the high road and get my revenge through success.

I'm 17, just to clarify. When I'm with my friends I am totally normal. I have good conversations just like everyone else, I laugh, I joke. In fact, my friends wouldn't notice how I really am outside of my social group. But there's a problem...
I don't dare answer the phone when I'm home alone. I don't dare ring up for things myself, for example, a doctors appointment. Also, during one on one conversations like a job interview, I find it very hard to maintain eye contact while actually understanding what the person is saying. I focus more on their eyes than the words they are speaking and this is a real issue. Another problem is, when I was at a local restaurant the other day, I wouldn't dare go up and ask for my own drink or the meal I wanted. I know I may come across as a 'faggot' to most of you, but I have no idea why I do these things. It's seriously ruining my life, and this is a huge barrier for me.

Edit: 

Update: I had an amazingly awesome day yesterday, even though I failed most of the challenges.  I'm going to pick another day later on and use mostly the same ones, since I didn't do most of them.  What I did do, however, is start the day with a social mindset, since I knew I was going to do my best to do at least some of them.  When my first class ended, I started chatting with someone from one of my classes.  We talked for 20 minutes until she had to leave, and as I was headed to grab some coffee, I saw another classmate doing some work.  I went to talk with him (never would normally do this), and we talked for a good bit, then ended up comparing notes and looking at our final project, and two other classmates happened to pass, so I invited them to join us, and they did.  We were doing this in an area near the faculty offices, so I ran into my professor as I was leaving, and chatted with him for a while.

So, a really social start to the day, and I was going to finally go get my coffee and do some challenges, but I noticed a group of classmates from another class occupying an empty classroom just to chat.  So of course, I had to join them.  Apparently, luck was on my side yesterday.  It's a huge university, but I just kept running into people I knew.  So, we talked for half an hour or more, then I finally went for my coffee.  But I ran into an old coworker on the way, we exchanged pleasantries, then FINALLY, my coffee, and I loved the baristas accent, so I told her that, and it made her happy.

Then I sat down and tried to convince myself to do more challenges.  It's so much harder than talking to people that I have an excuse to be talking with (classmates).  I feel like I'm just annoying people if I stop them when they're walking the opposite direction, and I'm reluctant to interrupt people with their heads buried in books, so I found the hardest part was choosing people to talk to.  Well, I was sitting next to a girl who looked really busy, but she had a really unique/colorful jacket, so I told her that and left to find some more people.  She actually seemed offended, but it could just be her voice, since she seemed sick.  No worries.  

I was trying to walk somewhere where I wouldn't know too many fellow students, but I ran into someone anyways.  She needed a pianist for some rehearsal, since the normal one was sick and couldn't make it, so I helped out for an hour or two.  As I left, I ran into one of the guys who was studying in a n unoccupied room earlier, and I sat with him and talked while he went to get coffee.  I might make a decent friend out of him, hurray.  Then it was already getting to be time for me to head to my next obligation, I had already killed hours.

So, I got something to eat and such, and went to my next thing.  I was extremely confident the whole time.  Usually I don't say much as I don't have much in common with most of the people there, but the whole damn time I was finding people to talk to and having a great time.  It was a fantastic day.  I was really lucky to run into such an absurd number of people that I knew.  I don't know how much of it is just luck, though, and how much of it is that I had my brain attuned to finding social situations.  I am a bit disappointed that I didn't do much to get outside my comfort zone, since talking to strangers is harder than what I did, for sure, but I still feel like it was a worthy way to spend my time.  

Next time I have a similar opportunity, I'll try the same thing again, and hopefully get to some more challenges. This time, I complimented 2 strangers, and said hi to a bunch of strangers in passing.

Honest, too. I have no problem making conversation, or feeling emotions by myself.

When I talk to people, however, I am not really feeling anything though. People will tell me about their childhood, or where they are from, or something they like to do, and for some reason, I don't really feel anything. I walk away from the conversation, and I don't even remember half of what they just told me. It's really strange. I also have a similar problem with names. If people tell me their names, I can't remember them for anything. I actually have made it a habit to ask people to write their names for me, because otherwise, I'm rather clueless.

The odd part about this is that I'm excellent at figuring people out. I'm extremely good at discussions with purpose (debates, orders, confrontations). I am excellent at communicating my thoughts. I'm clear, confidant, and very pragmatic. Basically, everything necessary in being didactic.

However, like I said before, and from my name, I just have a hard time being empathetic. If I want to I put myself into someone else's shoes, I have to create the scenario in my head. From there, it all works fine. I can feel their insecurity, joys, fear, all those things. I just lack the mental shortcut that makes me ""relatable"". 

I've always been really academic, so that doesn't help make me extremely interesting. Honestly, in conversations, I can read people like a book, but that doesn't matter a damn if I can't even relate to them readily. I just find myself doing the usual ""agreeing"" or ""telling a related story."" I get along fine, but it feels like a chore, rather than a fun conversation where I ""meet someone new"" and ""have fun.""

**TL;DR:**  I can do all the moves, but I can't really find enjoyment or be relatable in most conversations. I was wondering if you guys had any advice for me.

""Get some sleep. Wake up early. Enjoy the quiet. Remove your distractions (music, news, facebook), and assess how much time you spend being angry or judging people's flaws. Reflect on your actual happiness with your situation and all that you could be happy about if only you cared.

""Why would I recommend these things? You are smart, as you so boast, but you may not realize that you spend much of your time distracting yourself. Lost in thought again? These are all draining activities. You may be spending the little energy you have solving problems you've formulated in your own head (in addition to the problems of the day). Being ""logical"" isn't an end of itself. It can solve problems, but if your brain is wired to only care about solving problems, then of course somebody's personal story will have no influence on you. It has no place in the mind you've built.

""You have to unwire this habit, you have to learn how to be happy without constantly feeding your brain with theories and problems to digest. It's an unseen addiction. You do this when you are alone, you like being alone, and thus you sit there, unregulated, with the needle in your arm like a junkie, and the most insidious part is you forget the needle is there. If people don't give you your fix, you throw them out. I don't think your problem is your social skills, the problem is where you invest most of your energy. Getting some sleep might help you reboot and make these assessments.""

1362197139.0,38,self.socialskills,19i89w,Speech and Eye Contact | Part 1 of How to get friends and confidence,charged_polarity,49,11,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/19i89w/speech_and_eye_contact_part_1_of_how_to_get/,"Eye contact plays a big role when talking to strangers. It shows that you are confident and actually listening to what the other person is saying. Looking at the ground while talking to people is actually rude because it sends the message of 'I don't care' or 'I'm not interested'. How would you feel if someone was looking at the ground all the time 
while talking to you?

When making good eye contact, it is important to smile and only look into their eyes for 5-8 seconds. This does not mean that you have to have a clock in your mind going

&gt; 1...2...3...4...5...6 LOOK AWAY NOW!!!

It means just keep it for long enough so they have your attention but don't keep it too long to so that you will look like [this guy](http://randomletterstotheworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/4829723_the-wheezy-waiter-staring-contest-jpg.jpeg). Try not to dart between eyes, just stick with one and you won't come across as nervous however it is okay to look away when thinking about something It may be hard the first few times, but after you practice holding it then you are good to go!

Even though speech does not play a big part in humans communicating, you still need to know how to carry on a conversation/start one. When talking with someone, you want to take a noun (name, place, object) from their sentence and ask them a question about it. For example:

&gt; You: How was your weekend?

&gt; Someone: It was very good, I went to *Some Place* with *Someone* and *Someone else*. We had lots of fun.

Now you can either ask a question about the place, or the 2 people. How easy was that? It really is as simple as that. A great way to make people like you and gain friends is to make them laugh. If they have a great time talking to you, why wouldn't they want to do it again? Same goes for boring people, if they had a bad time around you then they probably won't want to speak to you out of their time. By me saying 'make people laugh', I do not mean telling jokes such as:

&gt; You: Hey why did the chicken cross the road?

&gt; Someone: Why?

&gt; You: To get to his house!!! Ba dum tiss

&gt; Someone: ...

I mean being witty. Being witty means:

&gt; Being clever and funny, making funny quips off the top of your head. Witty people are clever and cool. Hang out with them. From UrbanDictionary (but its right)

Just say small things that are funny and relate to the current topic you are talking about. When you smile, other people will generally smile back at you (like 90% of the time), and it will also make then feel more comfortable.

In the next part I will talk about confidence with posture and confidence in how you talk.

I'll set the scene - I was invited to go to the pub by a couple of friends, it was meant as a sort of catchup thing for all of us. It was me, two friends I've known really well since secondary school and a group of about six guys who went to the same school but I was never friends with or spent any time with in any way.

So we got there and most of them were already there, I wasn't quite sure how to go about it cause they already technically knew who I was but we were never friends and we hadn't been in the same school for over six years. So I mainly talked with the friends i've known for a long time. Then some more people showed up, one of which I definitely didn't know. So I thought I'd be friendly and I said hey i'm twasthrownaway, nice to meet you. Then he said in kind of a rude way, yeah I know who you are and everyone kind of smirked and laughed. Then carried on talking with each other.

Just to be clear, I found out this guy did go to my school. But I had never spoken to him, didn't know his name and well never met him before.

Well this wrecked my confidence as I really had to build myself up to go and I generally find it really hard to talk to people or introduce myself because of my AvPD.

So what should I have done while I was there? These guys were already sort of ignoring me and when I tried to be friendly they were just rude. Am I missing something? Should I have just acted like we all know each other even though I know nothing about them?

This morning I mentioned my friend's (a girl) diet supplements out loud. I was only talking casually about them and made a joke about their inneffectiveness, but she told me later it embarassed her. I felt like an idiot because I barely recall talking about them!

Another instance, I made a bad joke at dinner which I'm not going to tell. I'll just say it ended with ""it means you're gonna get some good sex tonight!"". 

Not 20 minutes ago, I was just on the phone to my sister who is studying at a different Uni. She is struggling in Engineering and I suggested maybe she should consider changing to a Bachelor of Science. There was an awkward pause and she told me she was very offended. She hung up pretty quick soon after that.

At 20 years old I've only held a girls hand once and she was joking the whole time.  Never had sex, never had a kiss, never hugged or cuddled with someone significant.  

And even worse is that the thought of it makes me just sweat thinking about it.

For example, I've been getting some hints from an old female friend that she'd may want to do something with me.  But whenever I even think about cuddling or having sex or something it makes me real nervous.

* I don't ask good questions

You don't realize how annoying it is until you don't have it happening to you all the time. 

The thing is, clumsiness is not some characteristic of your brain that non-clumsy people don't have. And they don't have something you're missing either - clumsiness is simply a bad habit that you need to overcome.

The difference between you and a non-clumsy person is *basically* - this is simplified - that non-clumsy people always have 1% of their brain devoted to paying attention to what their body is doing, where it is, and where other things are when their body is in motion. That's it. If you watch a non-clumsy person take a sip of a drink and then put the glass down, they *look* very briefly at where their arm will be moving, and where the glass will go. It isn't a conscious effort, because it's a habit they have. It just happens automatically.

This might sound annoying to you - the idea that your thoughts will always be somewhat hampered by having to pay attention to what you're doing - but I promise that you won't even notice it. It won't cut into your daydreaming or whatever. What it will do is make life easier and increase your confidence.

So, all we need to do is make it a habit of paying attention to what you're doing. To do this is simple. A few times a day, for a few minutes, give your movement 100% attention. Just focus on where you are, what you're doing. Obviously, make these few minutes those when you're moving around a good amount. Maybe when you're getting ready in the morning, for instance. If you do something like put a drink down, *look* first at where you are going to move your arm and put the drink down, and then do it, while focusing on your arm and how it's moving and where it is.

You'll find something amazing happens - during these minutes, you won't be clumsy! And, after just a few weeks of this, you'll see that all of a sudden this is a natural habit you have whenever you do anything - and it *doesn't require thought anymore*. It's just a natural thing you do. And viola, you are no longer clumsy. And this probably won't take nearly until September - it worked for me in a few weeks.

I've taken tons of advice from /r/socialskills in the past and came across a little tip of my own. I will better explain this after breaking down my trip to the mall.

""I'm probably going to see someone I know."" It *always* happens. I'm sure others will agree that this seems occur quite often and especially at a mall or local event. Sure enough, not even 5 minutes of walking through the doors and turning the corner I see a group of 4 guys I went to high school with two years ago. I was sort of friends with them. I haven't been in touch with anyone from school since I graduated. We stop and talk briefly. They all have a handshake/back-pat they greet everyone with and I fucked it up 3/4 times. At this point my face probably flushed, I'm trying to make eye contact the best I can and make a bit of small talk. After the conversation is over we all do a little fist bump and go our separate ways. Thank god I didn't completely miss any of those fist bumps. Immediately after I feel like an idiot. ""Those guys are probably laughing at how much of a loser I still am."" That's when I started to think over what I did wrong and learn what to do or say the next time I encounter someone I know. 

I have a small budget when shopping for clothes. I'm also very picky and rarely buy anything at all. Most of my browsing through stores consists of hitting up all the stuff I'm interested in, looking at every single price tag to confirm I can't afford anything and seeking no help from the clerks. Usually I walk in and out pretty quickly. While walking into this particular store I am greeted by a younger girl. 

&gt;""Hi there! Is there anything I can help you with?""
""Oh, no thanks. I'm just looking around"" 
""Wow, looks like you're on a mission!"" 

On a mission? That's the first impression I gave? I then noticed how quickly I walked to the rack of denim. I knew what I was there for, but I was trying to do it as quick as possible. I was making straight B-lines to each destination while trying to avoid any conversation. Again, I recapped the awkward interactions and now here I am talking about what it took for me to figure this out.

Mise-en-scéne: I'm at a party. Suddenly I start chatting with this cute girl (girl C) and we start to hit it off. Everything is going really well until guy D (douchebag) appears and starts talking to the same girl. He interrupts me in the middle of a sentence and starts speaking over me. Then he positions himself in a way that he cuts me out from the girl. As I move to reposition myself, he look at me and says: 'Here, go get some drinks' - and shows me a 50 dollar bill. He turns to look at girl C and she in turn turns to look at me. I also feel guys and one girl (hostess of the party and a good friend of guy D), also staring with grins on their faces; waiting to see what happens. I get this huge 'hole in my stomach' feeling...

1.) There are people who are looking at me; waiting for my reaction. First thought I get: If I somehow insult, offend or best their friend, they're very probably going to dislike me and even become rude. In addition, guy D seems to be a very popular guy. and it could hurt my standing in this group to get in the wrong side og him.

So what? Do I really need these people? Will these people liking me really affect my life in a crucial way? What can happen if they dislike me: worst-case scenario, I don't get invited to their parties anymore. Is this really going to shatter my heart? Is my life ruined if these three people (or even the totality of a HOUSE PARTY) dislike me? And what about getting on the wrong side of guy D...is he my long lost brother or something? Hell no! Let them stare, judge, gossip or whatever they want to do. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TYPE OF PERSON I AM.

2.) Now, what do i want? I have this hole in my stomach feeling. Why? Let's see, it started as soon as I felt my chances with girl C going down...this means that I have a desire to have a good chance with girl C. Chance to what? Chance to have something sexual with her. Therefore: I DESIRE GIRL C SEXUALLY. 

3.) I like this girl, she is really cute and nice. Is it possible that I'm being a douchebag myself for having a desire to have something sexual with her instead of wanting to get her to know better? NO. HELL NO. I am a man and have sexual needs. This girl attracts me and therefore it's only natural that I desire her sexually.

4.) So I now know and accept the fact that I desire this girl sexually. Should I kill guy D (my rival) and rape girl C? That would certainly fullfil my desire. NO. HELL NO. That is wrong and I'm not going to do it. 
Should I wait a while and start trash-talking guy D to the girl? NO. I don't talk about people behind their backs.

5.) So now I know what I will not do. But what will I actually do? Is this girl really worth it? Shall I risk an unpleasantness or even a fight with guy D for a simple girl? I mean, there are millions of fishes in the ocean, right? NOOOOOOO. HELL NO. I desire this girl.  I'm a pretty great guy and I deserve this girl. This girl also deserves being with me, instead of that guy. But she doesn't know it yet. I have to show it to her. And this guy and his attempts of humiliation aren't going to magically disappear. I DESIRE THIS GIRL AND I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT...

6.) Ok...so I'm going to do something about it. How is my current situation? This guy is trying to humiliate me in front of her so he can have her, instead of me. If he succeeds, I may have probably lost all chances with girl C. Therefore, I have to beat him. How? He's trying to get me to go buy drinks, as if I were submitted to him. I cannot let this happen. In addition, I have to keep my connection with girl C in order not to surrender her to him. What do i have? I have already started of some chemistry with girl C. In addition, I make pretty good eye contact. What do i lack?My conversation with girl C has been interrupted. Therefore, what will I do? I'll politely but firmly tell him that the bar is over there and he can help himself to buying his own drinks. Once I have said this, I will deeply look into girl C's eyes, mantain a confident body language and keep on talking to her, disregarding guy D.

7.) I know what to say, but I feel that my words are paralyzed in my throat. I breathe deeply, clear my mind and let the words come out. Then, I turn to girl C, look into her eyes, and with calm and confident body language keep on speaking with her.

8.) Two scenarios. One: The girl keeps on paying attention to me and the guy loses confidence. He lingers for a couple of moments and then turns and leaves. I bested him. Only natural. I don't let it get to me and keep on focusing my thoughts and energies on flirting. Two: The guy turns and stares at me. I don't flinch. The girl suddenly feels uncomfortable and leaves. I didn't get her. I didn't let myself be humiliated and gave it my best shot....oh well, there are more girls in this party and I know I have the balls to hit on them.
That's it for now. This post is getting a bit long but I did think that an example is of great help.

A few months ago I met a guy who also started volunteering on the same day. Since we're both busy doing stuff and are often preoccupied with different things it's not as if we hang out together for the full two hours but we do talk whenever we get the chance - like passing remarks and five minute conversations when we're on a break - and I would say that we've progressed to the points where we're friends but not close friends (think in high school where you know a kid in a class and you sit next to and talk to them but you aren't in the same circle of friends and don't hang out except for the classes you have together). 


Anyway, he asked for my number the other day and I gave it to him. We started texting and his texts have gotten incredibly flirtatious. I've been trying to laugh them off and sort of sidestep them but he's persisting. The thing is, I don't know how to tell him that I'm not interested without it being incredibly awkward. I have work next to him every week and I really enjoy talking to him as a friend. 

Is there a way I can stop the flirting but keep the friendship? Note that we're both seniors in HS and that I am by no means a girly-girl/coy teenaged girl around him - I call him dude/bro/mate/man, and if we're not talking about gaming we're bagging each other out and complaining about school. I can flirt, and I can play the part of the girl who wants the guy - I am pretty sure what I am doing above is not it.

I subbed to this subreddit sometime ago, but never really came here. I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and researching on Alter-egos. I assume many of you guys know what they are. For the unaware; alter-ego: (n) A person's secondary or alternative personality.

I'm not going into too much detail here, because it's pretty late on the east coast. But, here's a run down on many traits a person's alternative self would possess. (From an introvert's perspective)

* Outstanding charisma.

* Being the most popular person, being known by everyone.

* Getting all the women, though if female, the men.

There's a ton more, but those are the main 3 points that I feel people create them.


**Why I think they work so well:**

Simply put, no one knows who this *person* is. Which means you could create any sort of character you'd like. In fact, many celebrities  use alter-egos and stage names often different from their natural personality. Think about it, and look at those 3 bullet points above. What do they have in common with the celebrity alter-egos?

**My theory on how to defeat and become your alter-ego:**

To answer the question above: Everyone knows them. If you're the most popular person, get all the girls, and possess outstanding charisma, you should be pretty use to everyone knowing who you are. Right? Exactly.

One way to defeat your alter-ego, is to automatically assume everyone knows you. Why are most celebrities the coolest people if you meet them? Because, they assume you already know who they are, so likewise they don't need to impress you. As such with other popular people.


**Closing thoughts:**

I hope this helps people with or without alter-egos. I find philosophy very interesting, so I thought I'd post here. Again, this is just a theory and it's developing, so don't come for my head if it. This is what helped me with my social skills so I tried to pass it along haha. Feedback is always accepted, if this goes over well, I'll write up a second part on how to feel more at home when in public.

Instead, from what I've learned and thought about, make the conversation genuine.  If you want to start friendships or get into a girl's pants, don't go about it with those objectives in mind.  Be honest and genuine, treat the conversation as a way to understand who the person is and what they are all about.  

But of course with this in mind, make sure you know what ""keys"" to turn to steer conversations whichever way you want depending on who you are dealing with (co worker, a client, possible hook up).

It's not so much that I'm lacking a social life, on the contrary, but I'd like to keep track of who they are, in a way.

My planned solution to this is writing down things I notice, such as what someone's favourite cuisine is, or their favourite style of music, what books they read.

Of course, I'm not planning to write these things down as we go along, but when I'm home I can update the file I want to keep.

It's not that Im not social or anything but it's just that I want to talk with people when I feel like it or when Im interested in the topic. I really like being around my friends and in situations like that I have the feeling that I have always something to say or to talk about. When I try to remember I realised that we mainly talk about nothing. Just fooling around or topics like football or ""have you seen this on reddit""... However we havent really that much to talk about, we still like being around each other. Its probably because we know each other for a long time and we know what we find funny and stuff.*

When I think about this Im finding troubles with meeting new girls. When you meet a girl you are supposed to have good conversations about the things she likes, what you likes,... Here Im finding troubles with. I have this idea that after one ""date"" you really are done talking to me. Its not that Im not interested in anything but I just dont know how to have a real long conversation I guess. For example I am interested in sports, travelling, history, movies,... but I cant hold very long conversations about them because I dont know much about them (in a way). I really like travelling (although I havent travelled much) and I really want to see the world. Its like my dream to backpack around the world. And thats about it. I can talk a little about my dream but there I have nothing more to say about. How am I supposed to have a good/long/fun conversation about travelling if you havent really travelled much yourself and dont really know that much about travelling? I am interested in travelling though.
Another example: When a girl plays tennis, what am i supposed to talk about? I know the rules and the good players and stuff but further than questions like *""do you like playing?"", how long?, competetive?, favorite player?""* I dont come.  About music the same thing: I can ask about her favorite groups/genres/festivals but although I like a lot of music I'm not that guy that follows that one group and like every song of their albums and so have nothing more to say something like ""yeah I just listen to lots of genres"" and name some of my favorite artists. I sure can have (really) short conversations about things but after a couple of minutes max. I have nothing more to say.

**Its just that I dont know about what Im supposed to have conversations about. Im interested in a lot of things but I cant talk long about them. I sure can talk about a topic for a little time (basic questions) but I cant get further than that. I cant have a long real conversation about anything. Also with my friends we mainly haven't long conversations about anything.** When we do its mainly about girls or life,... but were mostly just laughing around, talking about nothing. When Im thinking about this Im always try to remember how I got so close with my friends. How did we meet and how did we get to know eachother that well and become so comfortable around each other. But I just cant remember. I really cant.

There is always this idea in my head ""how am I ever supposed to find a girl if I dont even know how to make a decent long fun conversation?"" I dont know that it's not good that you think like this but I really think Im kind of a boring guy to have a decent talk with. However Im not stupid or anything, **I dont really have any topic where I could talk about ""for hours.""**


Can somebody please give me advice?

I'm doing a summer internship in a city that I don't know many people in (my parents moved here while I was at school so this is my first time even being here). As I'm spending the next four months here, I definitely want to try to make the most of it and make some connections and meet people. Where I work, there are other interns my age, however we don't work in the same departments so its really only chance that we ever run into each other.
Yesterday, though, we all decided to get a together, as the new interns and go out for lunch. That worked out rather well, and I got along with two of the guys really well, and I found out that they, too, don't really know anyone around town. 

**And now the question part...**
I didn't feel like we had known each other all well enough to ask for phone number swapping or anything, though I would really like to get to know theses guys better to hopefully try to build some sort of social life here this summer. I just don't know what the next step is if I want to try to organize something else. We all have work emails, however I personally feel like sending a ""hang out"" offering would seem a bit odd in the workplace. (It should be noted that we organized lunch just one of the times we ran into each other one day). I *do* know enough about them to be able to find them through Facebook, but I don't really know what that would look like if I added them right now. Frankly, I'm not very worried about actually talking to them or being social, but most of my worries come from initiating any plans or actions to get to that point. 

So, any good tips and such for trying to get this going more?  


**TL;DR** - Working in a new town for the summer, want to get to know some of the fellow interns better. Not sure how to get other plans organized as we don't see each other on a regular basis.

I started the job 9 months ago knowing I wouldn't get my tips, but instead get minimum wage an hour ($7.25). Which wasn't too bad, considering we are pretty slow most of the time. But I started keeping track of my tips and realized I was missing out. 

Cut to last month; our head-chef/manager had his probation revoked and is spending some time in jail. After talking to the owner  he asked me to be a manager. I had never met him before, or even knew of his existence. I asked if that involved a raise to which he replied ""Yeah, don't worry about it"". So he came and taught me how to manage things and scheduled me 8 more hours a week.

One month and two pay periods later I still haven't seen an hourly wage increase. 

For some perspective, If I were to make tips and waitress wages I would make on average $80.33 a day and I make $55.25 a day at my current wage. Just in the last 18 days of April I have been jipped $249.90 (I even included tax and days that I split tips in my calculations).

At this point if you are wondering why I am still there, three words; Free. Indian. Food. 

Also, I just got a job as a part-time bartender to make more money. So I have another job in case the restaurant shuts down or refuses to pay me more. I'd like to keep both jobs, which leads me to my question.

How do I convince a boss, that I've met once, to give me a raise?

TL;DR Don't tip at Indian restaurants. OR at least ask if the wait staff gets the tips.

Even when the bullying pretty much stopped in high school, by then I had built up this protective persona (superior, bitchy, emotionless, manipulative, dishonest, etc) so much that almost no one was interested in being my friend. I worked extremely hard to overcome my shyness through a combination of improv club and my aforementioned superior ice queen persona, and I was lucky enough to succeed, mostly.  

I'm in my early/mid 20s now, and nowadays I'm not quite as unfriendly as I used to be. I work in customer service and I'm ok at my job, I'm genuinely pleasant with my coworkers, I make small talk with (receptive) strangers out in public, and sincerely/non-creepily compliment people often. But still, I am horribly, desperately lonely, and I realize that I'm not exactly a catch as far as friends go. I've tried to do the standard ""friend-making"" things (joining groups for things I'm interested in, meeting people just for the sake of meeting people instead of with a ""friend making agenda,"" etc) and I just don't seem to be getting anywhere. Some of this is due to the fact that I don't really have a whole lot of interests and I probably smell like desperation, but I'm scared that I'm a sociopath and completely incapable of being friends with people. I know that I can be super manipulative (and if I'm being honest, I kind of delight in it sometimes, even though I'm aware that it's horrible) and although I've always felt that I'm smarter than most people, I've become more aware that I'm really not and people are probably able to pick up on it when I think they're inferior.  

Despite my social issues, I've somehow never had difficulty getting involved in romantic relationships. I have, unfortunately, been in a couple of relationships with an abusive partner (and I'm currently in one - working on getting out, don't worry), but generally I've dated perfectly lovely men and women. I have never pursued anyone romantically/sexually, but I seem to passively enter these relationships very easily and then they get super intense quickly. I've never been single for more than a couple of weeks at a time. I realize that this is not healthy, but I can't seem to stop.  

I know that you're going to recommend therapy! I would too, if I was hearing this from someone else. Therapy is theoretically awesome, and it's something that I know I need. The only thing holding me back is an experience I had as a teen. My mother put me in therapy and unbeknownst to me, the therapist reported back to her nearly everything I said. It was a huge breach of trust and it traumatized me. I know that this sort of thing is very unusual and totally illegal, so I'm pretty confident that it would never happen again, but still. Traumatic! So I'm very very cautious about finding a therapist, and I'm scared that I'll pick the wrong one and it will ruin therapy for me forever, again.  

I would really appreciate input here, even if it's just, ""yes, you suck, get thee to therapy!""

I am trying to change my life. For past 6-9 months I've been lurking here, on seddit, ihaveissues and many other reddits. Now, I am more confident and more outgoing person. I am a lot better in dealing with women, though I seem I can't make any friends.

I mean, I made 1 friend [21f, old highschool friend].

I have some ""friends"" in my group, but we never go out, never do anything fun so I don't consider them a real friends - yes, yes and yes, I tried initiating some activities. Didn't work out.

I have no social anxiety, I am not afraid of talking to strangers. Yet 20 years of being anti-social left its mark and coming up to a random **guy**, engaging small-talk and setting up something for later seems a little weird. I don't know why, don't ask me, I have always had problems talking to men. Though, since the beginning of my journey those problems aren't that ""visible"".

Is that a sign of insecurity? How to finally get rid of it?

And.. internet addiction. I stopped playing MMOS but I have nothing else to do. I can't find job for past 6 months, I spend lots of time at home on the internet or I go out and go to office - I'm assistant in a parliamentary office, can go there whenever I want and for how long I want [flexible working hours].

I am addicted, I can't live one day without PC / laptop. 

I'm broke and spending time on the internet I explain to myself with nothing better else to do.

I was just wondering if mentally and emotionally people here know how to talk to people and initiate conversation, and talk about interesting and relevant subjects.. But then their body won't calm down enough for their brain to think straight and initiate the conversation? I have a problem where I mentally and logically know how to talk to people, and I can be very charismatic when I want to, but besides being introverted (and having my energy often sapped out of me after talking to people), I also generally get a strong fight or flight response when I talk to people, unless it's the perfect situation (with someone I'm not intimidated with, in private). I've even tried tuning out of my emotions during presentations for my school, but I found that I still studder horribly, and that I lose some of my precous intuition (which makes me a good speaker when I want to), because I've shut down my emotions. Worse yet, the anxiety often makes me want to say whatevers necessary to get the conversation done with, and could potentially make me come off as a disgruntled or negative person. I can be negative towards myself, but only because I'm a perfectionist.

Edit: Because I mostly wait for the most opertune situations to initiate conversations with someone, I've noticed that I have many symptoms of avoidant personality disorder. I'm assuming that this is strongly linked to general social anxiety.

Does anyone else experience this combination, or feel similarly in day to day life or at school?

Its either advice I can't use, or stuff I've tried and doesn't work, or it doesn't apply to me for some other reason.

I've annoyed them plenty with my complaints about my situation.  I think I've lost one because of it.  I can't help it, I have no one else to talk to.  I work mostly alone, in a highly academic field.  My work peers are all older than me and married, and even still, they politely decline any social invitations.  I'm an overall nice person, friendly, a bit shy.  I just can't understand why this is happening.  

My area isn't great for meeting people of my age and interests, but I still can't find a way past it.  I'm not social, but I'm almost willing to do anything within reason at this point.  Going up and talking to strangers absolutely terrifies me, but I'm more scared of staying alone like this for much longer.  I've tried Meetup, there's nothing there for me.  I don't like to play sports, and if I did, there's no kind of ""pickup league"" or anything to join.  I've never been to a bar alone, I don't think I could do it.  I go to a local coffee shop, and a book store nearby, and the park, but these places are awful for making new friends.

I have other hobbies (cooking, electronics, Mandarin, working out), but there are no ways for me to connect that with other people.  Classes are not an option.  The local parks department's cheap classes are things like knitting and oil painting.  Actual courses at the community college are in the hundreds of dollars, and way out of my price range.  

Dating is going even worse.  I've been on OKCupid for months, and I'm just not attractive, charismatic, or confident enough to connect with someone.  I've sent out so many messages, few responses, no dates.  I know I should build up friends before trying to date, but it feels so awful not having someone for so long.  Please don't tell me yet again that I need to just learn to be happy by myself, and I will meet someone.  That hasn't worked for 10 years.  It is so crushing to hear that again...

TL;DR - 26 year old guy, no friends, no girlfriend.  I feel like I've tried everything I can.  Please, I just need some advice that I can use, that will actually get me out of this, this time.

And I feel like sometimes someone would be willing to pay money to have someone to talk to, but pretty much the only way you can pay someone to share intimacy with you is to pay for something sexual (like going to a strip club.)

So my question is, would you be willing to pay for someone to talk to, or do you think that other people would?

With the exception of two women that I've just begun dating, these three exes-turned-friends are the extent of my social life (which should speak to my inability to make new friendships).

Anyway, when I'll text one of my friends something like ""wanna grab a coffee?"" I may not even get a response on the same day that I ask the question.  Sometimes I'll get a response the next day, but if I don't get a response by then I probably won't hear from them until I either text them *again* (which is extremely rare) or they just decide to contact *me* at some later date while they pretend that my text never happened.  This goes for *each* of my three female friends.  There's not someone I can talk to that I feel like I can rely on to get back to me in any reasonable length of time.

So yesterday I sort of snapped at my closest of the three friends (we stopped dating about four years ago) because I asked her ""Would you like to hang out later?"" and she didn't respond until after I said (sarcastically) ""Heh.  K.  Have fun."" which was about five hours later and too late to do anything (she'll be leaving town for a good long while, so I was looking forward to seeing her first -- *her* idea, I should add).  She called me and said ""hey Mr. Moody,"" and tried to tell me she was busy all that time, even though it's pretty obvious that she blew me off (she logged onto facebook multiple times, etc).  I didn't respond well, and basically told her that I'd talk to her some other time to keep the issue from escalating further.

But this got me thinking: am I being needy?  Whenever anyone tries to get a hold of me I always respond immediately.  I feel like it's one of the most important gestures of friendship to let them know that I'm responsive to them even if just to let them know that I'm busy and I will get back to them later.  My ""friends,"" however, are playing this *very* fast and loose.  Of course I have histories with these three women which could complicate matters, but I *genuinely* appreciate them as friends and I like their company, and they seem to like mine.

Of course I may have problems of my own, but assuming that I'm otherwise *okay*, what is the protocol with respect to texting?  Is not responding at all an acceptable way of saying ""no""?

Reddit, I'm doing it wrong, I know this, and I want to change it. I don't know where to even start. 

How about with what exactly is wrong...

1. In about 10 hours I turn 25 years old. *By myself*. I've lived in a large city (6 million people) for about 10 years now. I've grown up here, gone to middle school, high school, and college here. 

2. As of today I have three people I would consider ""friends"". The reason for the quotations, is that tomorrow I will call or text them to tell say we should hang out because its my birthday and they'll all respond ""Sorry I'm busy, maybe another time?""

**I suck at MAKING friends/relationships**
I don't really know why. Its always been hard,before entering college I had been to 8 different schools ( My parents had a really bad divorce ). Maybe this has something to do with it? 

I'd say I'm good looking, intelligent, interesting, funny, and kind. I don't know what the problem is. I'm not an asshole.

I didn't have a girlfriend in high school but since then have spent about 50% of my time in a relationship. Usually my girlfriend will become my best friend. I'll show her the cool stuff that I like and she will do the same. Whenever I'm in a relationship I feel a lot more complete, like I have a direction and I'm happy. *I'm still unsure if the last sentence is a problem. We shouldn't rely on others for our happiness right? We should be happy on our own? Yet everyone is looking for someone to share their lives with? When I'm in a relationship I feel like I become more interesting/better because we are both adding to each other. Similar to how the power rangers all made the bike robot* Ya I'm awesome for saying that :)


**History If It Helps**

Age 4 Mom left us 

Age 8 Mom has been back in my life for a year with visitation. She says, ""If your Dad is going to make it THIS HARD to see you then its not worth it"" &lt;-- Last time I saw her

Age 12 Another new school, I'm always eating lunch alone finally a group of kids asks me if I want to play football with them after school. FUCK YEA I DO! After school I ride my bike there. They beat me up and steal my bike :(


Age 14 I met what I guess is ""my best friend"" (one of the 3 friends) we use to hang out A TON and he's always had a lot more friends then me. Now I haven't seen him in a few months


Age 20 I meet my other two friends. One is just a really bad person. The other is a great person but we just don't really have much in common anymore.

I have been struggling for a long time with trying to branch out and make more friends. I am for the most part, very introverted, but I crave enriching experiences with other people. I generally don't have any one I would call my ""friend"" aside from my boyfriend and my 'best' friend who has lived near me since we were 14. 

My boyfriend is an amazing person and I love spending time together alone with him. We're very similar on many levels, and it's awesome to have someone to always turn to that will listen and care. Our biggest difference is that I want to be more social, and he's fine being completely alone. He basically has no daily friends - just old friends from high school he plays music with occasionally.

My best friend and I have gone through a relationship shift and we haven't been spending as much time together as we used to. He's been hanging out with my ex boyfriend a lot lately so I just haven't really had anyone else to hang out with other than my current boyfriend. For years we spent almost every day together just doing random stuff, but that's no longer the case.

My response to this is to get out, make some new friends and try to open the doors to some new relationships. My problem is this: any time I try to get out and 'be social', I end up wishing I was at home instead. I'll go out with someone I know from class or work, only to be counting down until I can get back home or be alone. But on nights like tonight, I'm laying on the couch all day wishing that I could just have some friends to do something with.

How can I overcome this feeling? I try to enjoy myself and actively engage in conversation in social situations, but after a point I just feel really disconnected and uninterested in anything anyone is saying. 

I can't tell if I'm just choosing shitty people to try and hang out with, or if it's a personal problem of being too picky when it comes to who I want to be friends with. I've been thinking that if I really wanted friends, I would already have them, and I just don't really want them or something.

Is making friends really that hard?

Advice greatly appreciated from anyone.,,33,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/xhsee/how_to_connect_with_others_and_have_more_fun/,"I am generally troubled by socializing in subtle ways that observers probably can't tell (I smile, I laugh, I say things), but its actually bothered me much more than anything else recently. Its stopping me from building the relationships I want, and I wanted to see if anyone here could share their thoughts and advice. The few things that irk me the most are:

1) connecting with anyone that isn't my close friend

2) disclosing my own feelings and emotions, making more statements

3) keeping the conversation interesting in 1 on 1 situations


1) is pretty vague, but its something that's eluded me the most. Some people I've met seem to have the ability to make you feel comfortable opening up to them, while I obviously don't. Is it actually more the energy you exude, as well as the nonverbal communication? My eye contact isn't particularly strong, and I don't smile enough. That could be ONE thing.

Besides that, I am quite bad at small talk. I'm an engineering student, and I am used to offering solutions to problems and issues that other people bring up. Thing is, I know that people are just trying to seek my understanding and empathy, not my stupid advice and analysis. You can't really skip small talk, but I really wish the conversation was something other than a comparison of majors, the outlook on the job market, and drunk stories. Obviously not everyone is comfortable disclosing their secrets and childhood memories to someone they've just met, but I want to be that guy that people are comfortable talking to, I really do.

2) I grew up being fairly shy, introverted, and showing a lot of supplicative behavior, i.e. approval seeking. When I'm in conversations with other people, I find myself asking WAY too many questions, many of these close-ended and concerned with finding out the facts, instead of the emotions. Problem is, usually I am not too comfortable socially, even with closer friends. Its not an anxiety sort of feeling, but I am just unable to tune out my mind's own thoughts and feel the vibe more. So all I hear is the words, and I ask questions about them. Sometimes I try to ask more ""why"" questions, but that's about it.

I just feel like I'm unable to really talk on a more human level, and also I feel like I have no opinion of my own when I'm around others. If you asked me face-to-face some simple questions that require my opinion, I would probably take forever to answer you, whereas sometimes when I'm taking a shower and feeling really relaxed, I can have these really fluent conversations with myself.

I am also a pretty blunt person. I know that you can't just ask someone to disclose their sensitive thoughts and opinionated views to you, but I honestly am the most interested in those kinds of topics. Yet you just can't say ""tell me about your passions"" or something, it just seems a bit odd. You have to slowly warm up, work your way towards those topics, but I just seem to lack the social finesse of doing so.

3) For example, yesterday I was sitting beside my friend's girlfriend during dinner, and she was bored (the boyfriend was away for a while). But I just couldn't come up with anything to say, even though I don't feel nervous around her. I wish I had more ""general"" ammo of conversation material, ones like ""how was your summer"", or ""have you been watching the Olympics"", but a way to keep things more fresh and interesting. I'd love to eventually talk about things like passions and dreams and past experiences, but it doesn't come about easily.


_

I know that being comfortable is the key, yet I wish I could make others feel better in my presence. I don't want to be the quiet guy who can't make interesting, fun conversation unless he's had a few beers.

I was horribly awkward and unconfident, while I'm still awkward, at least I make eye contact now and can hold a conversation with a girl.

Because of this I can't really tell if someone is flirting or just being friendly, because I have no experience to really base it off of.

I have some scenarios that I would like to give, and would you please tell me, flirting, or not and why, just for a definite answer? In other cases I'm just wondering how could I be so stupid and how to prevent my self from making similar mistakes again. So these are the situations and some background:

Girl A:
We met about 6 months ago at the beginning of the school year, we hung out a reasonable amount at school and out, went roller blading and swimming, and we talked about . Early on I had a crush on her, however I stopped later in the semester. That was first semester, second semester, I told her at one point I had a crush on her when we talking about people we like/liked. She thought it was sweet and said she didn't like me that way. She also like asks about if I noticed girl blah or blah, what did I think of how girl blah looked and like comments on her boobs. 

TLDR: I think she is just a friend and wants me to be more outgoing and confident when talking with girls.

Now the odd thing, a few weeks ago at lunch she hugged me and then like felt up my stomach which was odd. Last  night/this morning at our highschool graduation party she and Girl B dragged me out to the like dance floor thing to try to get me to dance, because I never have. Girl A was like trapped in the middle of a bunch of people and both of them were grinding on me. Then earlier today she poked me in the stomach and said how are you so buff or something of that accord, I can't remember exactly what.
So my confusion is again about, is she flirting?

Girl B:
I met her first semester as well, she was going out with one of my good friends but they broke up a few weeks ago. We've talked a little on Facebook the last few weeks, mainly about college because we are both going to UCSD for engineering but also about our interests and things. 

Yesterday/this morning she said she couldn't wait until we were at UCSD so we could go clubbing. She said something about me taking my shirt off to intimidate someone if they were an asshole and it I was just like, normal conversation, normal conversation, take shirt off, wait what?

Girl C:
So this was the second girl I had ever really had a conversation with and the first I felt was possibly flirting. Looking back on it I realize she was flirting then, now I'm just confused.

I met her at the beginning of the school year in my english class. She suggested we to zumba and yoga together but I said no. She brought up some topics related to sex but claimed she had never seen a penis and claimed to be ""innocent"" and acted this way for a while,s omething I did not understand. She said she never drank and stuff like that, which seemed perfectly reasonable because I don't, but then one of her freinds was like ""HA, thats so funny."" So I don't understand why she would have lied about that in the first place. She said we should go skinny dipping, I also said no. One of her freinds came over to my group of freinds and invited me to come sit with her and her freinds, I went over but just wasn't sure what to talk about. I waited a while, doing nothing, eventually I texted her asking her to go out to lunch but she never responded.
Some of her freinds said she liked me, but I was unsure. This was the first time I had been in a situation like this.

Since then we have just been friends and talked in our common classes. We are both going to college in San Diego and last week she suggested we go skinny dipping, but she has a boyfreind, so I'm confused.

TLDR: I met a girl, she flirted with me then, but now I'm confused because she seems to be flirting but has a boyfreind.

Girl D
I met her shorlty after meeting girl C. We became friends over about two months at my highschool's robotics team when we spending alot of time together due to build season, a one month period where we put in over 250 hours of time each to build our robot.We probably talked for about 50 hours that month.
We became freinds, hungout and talked alot. One thing I remember that seems alittle odd was she was asking about how much I benchpress, if I could benchpress her and then started talking about beating me in a fight/beating me in wrestling and she suggested we wrestle. I was slightly confused. We hungout after robotics around 1am or so, went stargazing a few times and watched a meteor shower. She introduced me to her freinds. We went out to lunch once, but I never made a move because I was unsure. She said once she wasn't interested in dating anyone until college because she was sick of the drama, but it seems she was flirting with me and alot of her freinds said she liked me, but I was confused due to her statements. She also gave me compliments and said things like ""How are you so amazing?"" ""How are you so cool?"" ""You are so strong"" ""You are so smart"" She posted on my wall on Facebook.

TLDR: A girl I met seemed to be flirint with me, but I was confused because she said she didn't want to date anyone until college.



I feel from these instances I have learned that I need to be more outgoing and freindly. I need to go out of my comfort zone, but I'm also confused by mixed messages.



Could you explain how I should have handled these situations better, without saying ""DUR HUR YOUR AN IDIOT""

In all these situations my freinds who have guys have made comments or jokes about me being strong, but I can't tell if they are just like making a joke about me or cockblocking or attempting to be a wingman? I don't show off I feel, but if someone else is in my oppinion being obnoxious or showing off I'll sometimes one up them.

In the last year I feel I have made reasonable strides for me, from never talking to girls to having several girls as freinds. I used to never make eye contact. I do now. I'm much less self conscious than I used to be, but I still am fairly self conscious and I would like to be less.

What are some topics you can talk about in general conversation? Like I have trouble with this.

I have a huge problem with meeting people. Once I've had an initial conversation with someone, I can talk to them all day just fine, but meeting people is so extremely difficult for me. It's like there's a giant invisible wall between me and everyone else.

The standard advice is ""get out more, join a club, go to campus events, etc. etc. etc"" but that's the thing. The only things to do on campus are only things that you can do with *other* people. All the clubs aren't interesting to me. There's nothing to do off campus that doesn't require you to be over 21.

I've fallen into sort of a depressive slump because of it. Crying spells, fits of anger, the works.

* Slightly autistic
* Failed one year and am now almost a stranger to my current peers. I have no friends in my current year. Though, while I got along better with my old peers, none of them were *friends* either.
* College life over here is different in some aspects. There are only a couple of student organisations, that mostly host parties, attend cultural events and, on a couple of occasions, organise trips. I attend the last two if I can afford them time- and money wise. But this isn't a big part of the student-scene. There are no student orgs that I'm aware of that are built on common interests, like a debate club or book circle. Nor do we have student dorms on campus, students generally live scattered across the city our uni is located in. And I live well outside that city. 
* There is a rich student nightlife in this city, but it's not the kind of socializing that I enjoy. I like to stay in with friends and do whatever, the problem being that I don't have a place of my own to do that, and where I live is both too far away and too secluded for people to bother with (you can't reach it with public transit alone). Also, I don't have a circle of friends: I have one friend and he sometimes lets me borrow his circle. 

One thing I hear quite often is that in the professional world, it doesn't matter *what* you know, but *who* you know. And that the purpose of going to college isn't just to learn, but to build up a network of professionals and peers. Needless to say... these are huge problems for me. Not just on a practical level, but as graduation is getting closer it becomes more of a source of anxiety for me. I *don't* have a network of peers, at least, none that consider me beyond the point of being a warm body with a name. I'm often ignored, and when I try to include/invite myself (when others wont) I meet resistance. I worry what will happen after I graduate. 


The autism thing is relevant too: I don't have problems making small talk, or talking to strangers, or standing up for myself, or even speaking in public. Conversations I have just fine, but something about me is *off* and when I've asked about it in the past, I can't get good feedback on it, because people can't put their finger on it. 
In addition to that, I tend to sometimes cross boundaries or say stupid shit without noticing it. This has cost me friends on more than one occasion, and the last time this happened this person accused me of fucking up things that are ""such common-sense stuff"". He then proceeded to rub my face into everything I did wrong in the last 2 years, in front of other people. It made me feel terrible, but this is the kind of feedback that I need, but I need it sooner than too late. I don't pick up on hints, not even the obvious ones, and this makes me come across as dense or stubborn sometimes. 

* THAT SAID: Am I a hopeless cause? Is it possible for someone who is autistic and whose social skills are at this point kind of rubbish to get to the point where your social skills are... at least average? 

I have about seven months left before graduation, one of whom I will regularly spend with my peers and the other we all work on our graduation projects and we'll probably not hear anything from eachother anymore, except on Facebook. 

* If I want to make friends or make a positive impression, am I too late? 
* And how badly did I screw myself? 
* Any tips on making friends, period, for my current situation? And post-graduation? 

And lastly:

I have noticed that when I'm talking with someone I'm comfortable with, I find it very easy to be smart, charming, witty, entertaining, etc. However, when I'm on unfamiliar ground, particularly in large groups or party settings, I become as dumb as your average brick.

The weird part is this seems to be independent of how nervous I am or how hard I'm trying. For example, the other day at a party, a guy was talking about his costume and how he was a nameless soldier from the vietnam war and made up a bunch of names for himself along the lines of ""vietnam dan"", which is the only one I can remember. Then he turned to me and asked if I could think of another name. The first symptom of my stupidity was that instead of playing off of it, I tried to actually answer the question, key word here being try. I gave it my honest best effort for a good 15 awkward seconds, before lamely admitting that I could not and saying nothing more.

Despite being a heterosexual male and not really even being interested in this guy as a friend, I still felt the same sort of brick-wall-esque mental blankness that normally comes from being very nervous in social situations.

So, my question is this: has anyone experienced this ""stupefying"" effect from being around unfamiliar people, even when you don't consciously feel nervous?

So they are not the best of friends to me and we don't have much in common.

I am/was really close to my high school friends even after we all went to different colleges. When my friends had breaks from school (summer, spring, etc) they would come back home and I would get excited because I finally have a group of friends to hang out with. My uni is ~30min away from our hometown and my apartment is in between. So not a far drive. These guys have always been there for me through the years. My best friend from the group I have known since the 1st grade!

Also I have been feeling like my friends and I were moving apart since they had their separate lives and friends at college and we never talked much when we were away (like on facebook or skype or whatever). I understand this happens and should be happy that we are even still good friends.

So last week some of my friends from high school graduated college and were coming back. I hit up the guy I consider my best friend out of the group (his name will be XYZ). I told him that my apartment is close by and even though I am taking summer school I am still down to hang out. He told me he was visiting his GF and that he would call me when he was back in town. I got excited because I would have something to do this weekend or at least in the near future!
So Friday, after I finished class, I had yet to hear from XYZ and assumed he was still with his GF. He is usually good about calling when he says he will. Later that night, while sitting at home alone, I hop onto Facebook to see that a few of my high school friends, including XYZ, were at a bar close by to my place.

This just put me into a bad mood where I have been putting myself down and thinking its my fault they didn't call. It solidified the idea that I have no friends and no one wants to hang out with me. My mind is racing through all the different possibilities as to why they didn't call, whether they are true or not. They have done this in the past. They would be back in town because their schools were on break. They had breaks at different times than me. So day time activities I wouldn't get invited because of class but night time and weekend things I normally would. More recently I didn't get invited to even the nighttime and weekend activities.

I am here looking of suggestions as to what my course of action should be. Should I try to just ignore the fact that they are in town and just go on with my life knowing that friends grow apart? Should I call them to hang out and act like nothing is wrong (this would probably be my normal response)? Should I confront them about it? I am not really a confrontational person so this one would be the most difficult for me.

Any suggestions/comments/concerns are welcome! Thanks in advance!

Here's my story in the form of a wall of text;

I don't really know where to start - i'm a freshman in university and i'm living in halls (in the UK) and i'm also a male, to start off.

The thing is, i've noticed only a handful of people actually like me and barely anyone i know enjoys spending time around me - i have no idea why and this has been really getting me down to the point where i can't take it any more.

While i do have a small group of (really nice) friends, throughout my life i've never really socialised with people - when i was younger i was really weird, so nobody really made an effort with me and i never learnt how to hang around with people in a group, and while over the last few years i think i've been getting better it's still at the point where nobody makes an effort with me, and because i don't know how to make friends i don't know how to go about improving my situation.

I realise one part about me people don't like is my personality - i try my best to kind (i offer help to those who i think need it, i can make small talk but it never ends up leading anywhere, i laugh at others jokes) but i realise i'm also *weird* ... and the thing which sucks is i don't know how as i can't see how i act from a normal persons' eyes so i don't know what to fix.

I also realise i'm boring - if i ever make people laugh it's by doing or saying something stupid on accident and *never* because i crack a funny joke (when i try, it's awkward silence)

I do hang around with people while in my daily classes but outside of that none of them want to spend time with me and i want this to change, i'd love to be one of those people who gets along with everybody and who people actually make en effort with.

There was a point where i tried initiating stuff with the people in my halls but after i kept hearing no's i stopped as it was disheartening.

The weirdest part also seems to be - i'm apparently fine when talking to people online... i can make people laugh and people actually want to know me ... so i realise i need to somehow make real life personality match my online personality, but that doesn't seem to work because i don't know what i do differently! :\

I have never had a girlfriend. Without sounding like a total douchenozzle, I'm smart, witty, funny, and fairly goodlooking. Girls have actually approached me several times before, but for whatever reason I politely declined each time.


I am usually a very social, outgoing person. I'm the guy that my friends absolutely insist on going out with them because I'm usually the life of the party. I have many friends (including females), but like I said, I've never had a real girlfriend. Worst of all, I've almost never been emotionally attracted to a girl. My problem and huge fear is not that I cannot get a girlfriend or form a relationship, but that I'm not romantically interested in very many females.


I went to a relatively small high school. My graduating class was &lt;200. I always attributed my lack of relationships to simply not being attracted to many girls, and there being a small number of girls at my school to choose from to begin with. By my senior year, I was set on the idea that I would just wait until college to search for a meaningful relationship.


Fast forward to now, I go to university. However, I go to a satellite school of a large university so I live at home and commute (everybody does... no dorms until 2013 lol). Pathetic as it may sound, I considered it a **huge** milestone when I simply developed a crush on a girl at my school. I was ecstatic because I literally hadn't been romantically interested in a girl for quite some time prior. Unfortunately she has a boyfriend -.-


Bottom line: I am undoubtedly heterosexual, but I'm worried that I'm attracted (beyond physically) to very few girls. Do I have ridiculous standards? Does anybody else experience this? What should I do? I feel like relationships at this age are an important part of growing up socially, and I am lacking in that respect. 


Could anybody suggest, perhaps, a more appropriate subreddit? I was a little stumped on where this belongs. Any advice on the topic at hand or a better subreddit would be **GREATLY** appreciated.

Thanks a lot.

What the hell do I do?,IrritableOwlSyndrome,46,17,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1j26si/seemingly_constant_birthday_parties_at_work_its/,"So I work in an office of around 15 people. Seems like every few weeks, we have a small birthday party for someone at our office. It's usually not too bad for an introvert such as myself since it usually only takes 5 minutes. I do dread it though because I know I have to make small talk with people and I hate bullshit small talk.

BUT in the last few weeks, our HR lady decided to add one extra thing that made the birthday parties infinitely more awkward for me. She decided that right after the birthday boy or girl blow out the birthday candles, we all must say something nice about that person. in. front. of. EVERYBODY!

This is hard for me as a naturally quiet and shy person. If I have something nice to say about you, I'll tell you in private. I'll definitely not say it in front of people. That cheapens it to me. Plus since we're such a large group, nobody wants to hear long drawn-out praise anyways. Everybody's kind of expecting a short and sweet generic Hallmark greeting-card message and I'm so not into that.

So far (for the last 3 parties), I've said/done the following:

Party 1: I simply told the guy in the most neutral and monotone way, ""You're doing OK. Keep it up.""

Party 2: I nodded at the guy and gave him a thumbs up.

Party 3: I sighed and said ""You know how I feel, dude.""

I'm afraid that I'm coming off as anti-social or as someone that's not into being part of the team. I'm very much into being part of the team and getting shit done. I feel like I should be judged based on the work I produce, not on whether or not I participate in bullshit small talk. Plus most of my co-workers know that I can be very social in small groups since I've hung out with some of them outside of work.

What should I do? Should I just suck it up and be fake like everybody else? Or should I continue with my passive protest and be seen as anti-social?

We've had some ""interviews"" beforehand, and back then I thought she was a nice girl and would fit in fine. And she really is; she doesn't cause any problems, and she's friendly and all that - I just find that we're not really on the same wavelength, socially speaking. I'm not that interested in the stuff she likes to talk about, I don't feel too invested in the stories she tells, and the activities she enjoys aren't really my cup of tea either. But apparently, she feels differently: She often seems to make an effort to talk to me and wants to hang out, and she likes to invite me along while being similarly interested in the kind of ventures I undertake. So I am polite and friendly, and I try to make her feel welcome and stuff, but then I often find myself hanging out with her just to be nice, while I'd rather be doing something else instead. I can understand her, too: she's just recently moved here, and she's trying to be friendly, meet new people and increase her circle of social contacts - I just don't think we're cut out to be friends, and honestly, I don't wanna invest time with her doing something that I don't enjoy.

So what do I do in a situation like this - how do I tell someone that I don't wanna spend time with them, without being hurtful, offensive, or insulting? I normally just try to be polite, but declining, and hope that they'll ""take the hint"", but I actually find that works less often than it doesn't - they'll still repeatedly try to invite me to come along. I've also experimented with gradually ignoring them more and more, but I've had that turn into a confrontation à la ""Why don't we hang out anymore, do you have something against me?"", and that's an awkward conversation to have, for both sides. So, I don't really have an idea how to act in a situation like this, where I'm not really interested in spending time with another person while they are. I'd appreciate your pointers and advice!

Now, I don't necessarily have issues when talking with girls, only the cold approach that's really hard for me. Escalating from that to a flirty level (On the first contact) is even harder to the point I can safelly say I never really succeeded on it. Other than that, the few female friends I asked about this had different opinions - one didn't believe on the first place, other said it was normal, and so on.

You guys have any tips, experiences, or even just honest opinions, about it?

During the fight, it came out that he hates talking with me about deep issues because he thinks I don't want to understand them. Instead, I just ask for his thoughts and then try to match them to my beliefs without putting in the effort of changing my own thoughts. He said he feels that I make him feel that no matter how passionate he is about an issue I will never be able to see that it's an important topic for him and that all I care about is showing him how much I understand it. That really hurt. 

What I've been *trying* to do, and apparently failing spectacularly at, is to show someone I understand where they're coming from by talking about the points we both agree on. So, for instance, my friend is a secular humanist, I'm a christian. I asked him about what he believes, and then I talked about the ways our beliefs were similar. I wanted to come across as non-judgmental and understanding, because a lot of times when I've talked about religion with someone else they've either been condescending to or outright insulting about my beliefs. I didn't want that to happen here, and yet it did. He said he really felt hurt that I would say I understood his beliefs and thought that I could discuss them intelligently with him after him just telling me when it had taken him years of trying to understand himself to formulate his beliefs. 

So, I don't really know where to go from here. I had thought that indicating I understood where they were coming from was a good way to meet on common ground and where we could go from there. Instead, I'm shifting over the attention to myself and I'm making my friend feel like his opinions are unimportant. I want to stop this.

In January, I transferred from a really small private school to a really large public school. I haven't made any friends yet and I think I know why.

I'm used to spending all school day with the same class. Now, I'm lucky if I have two classes with a person. My only conclusion is that I need some other way to talk to people, especially if they sit on the other side of the room.

So...texting. I can't come up with a better way.

I have absolutely no idea how to ask someone for their phone number. Someone suggested that I just do it and the person won't find it weird. But I'm a little worried they might think I'm flirting with them or they'll give me a look, as if to say, ""Why would I want *you* to have my number?""

Am I over-thinking this or is there some universal trick as to how to non-awkwardly ask someone for their number?

Backstory time. I was raised super fundamentalist Christian. Like ""demons are real, you can't hold hands with boys, evolution is a ridiculous lie"" fundamentalist. My parents have scooted over to the left a tiny bit (my mom has short hair and my dad *gasp* got a tattoo) but they're still fundys at heart. 

When I married outside of the faith, it was a huge deal, and a bigger deal still when I got divorced. My dad actually thinks I turned my ex-husband gay because I allowed him to look at too much porn. 

I'm now going through a huge shift in my own beliefs. I am living with my boyfriend and a bunch of other people in the nearest major city (which happens to be in another state) to my parents. Most of my roomies and I are major stoners, and I've been completely honest with the important people in my life about it. I've also been honest about the shift in my spiritual beliefs. 

One of my most important values is authenticity, so I'm not going to pretend to be something I'm not around my family. I feel like I owe them an accurate picture of who I am. It's not like I call them up and tell then every time I take a bong rip, but when they asked me if I had started ""doing drugs"" I told them, yes, I enjoy smoking a little after work, kinda like my dad likes to have a beer after his shift.

They seemed to take it pretty well, but now my 16 year old baby sister is not allowed to come over. They say it's because they don't know my roomies well enough, but that's completely ridiculous. I've lived with people they don't know before and it's never been a problem. She has a car and a drivers license and is a responsible, straight-A student. It's not like I'm gonna seduce her with drugs and turn her into a hippie, I'd just like to hang out with my favorite teenager. I'm also worried about her because she spouts the same narrow-minded bullshit that my parents preach without even realizing there are other viable ways of life out there.

I discussed it with my 21-year old sister, and she said she thinks I'm a bad role model and supports my parents' decision.

(I am 18). I thought I could just keep to myself for so long - survive as an introvert but I just cant... You have to have social affiliation- otherwise you are going to go insane.

My social circle consists of my mother, brother and father, literally no one else. I do not have this luxury you all have. If friends were as important as money in that retrospect I am too poor to lay on the streets in this country. I am sick and tired of witnessing people laughing together, asking to hang out with each-other. Coming back from lunch together where as I go home for lunch.

What I find really confusing is the fact why NO one asks me if I want to go to a party or at-least hang out at a cottage during the weekend let alone any of that matter. If this was the logic of the world no one would have friends. There has to be reachers or people who follow others instead of being followed~ I do not want to be one of them. Hence I think of myself as an legitimately unlikable person.

Just say hello to me - give me some attention and I will be happy for that day. Its so pathetic that I need someones attention. I hate the way my ******* mind works. I want to be strong ~ independent and by myself. But why cant I??

Also this may be important to know. I do not suffer from Aspergers or have a rigid personality, I have Social Anxiety at the least. I am handsome and consider myself intelligent. There is nothing physically wrong with me and I live in a small city with opportunities everywhere...

I'm a huge disappointment to my parents. I am obedient and a hardworker but am virtually silent when they ask me how my day was. My father was an extreme extrovert at my age; going to a party every Friday - having sex with every girl ect... He looks at my face and then think to himself what went wrong. He says he is suffering when I am. And I DON'T WANT to suffer. 

There is only one solution. And that is to push myself to talk to people my age. But I feel I'm wasting their time and mine. It never goes anywhere, and they don't talk to me next time I see them...

I'm 17 years old and I'm a female. All my life I've been unconfident, awkward, boring and average which I think correlated with having no true friends. There are people that I talk here and there but that is it. I never ""hanged out"" with anyone (no movies, no parties, no windowshopping, no concerts, etc...and it's not because I'm not allowed too...I just never get the invite) I admit that I'm not that physically attractive (slightly overweight and look twice my age) and the first impression some may have is that I always look upset/mad/depressed. Even in photos where I'm happy, I'll forget to smile. 

I'm going to university (aka college) in another small city where I can get a my chance to improve myself. I'm really desperate and I want to make some friends at the university I'll be studying at. I think people don't really talk to me is because there isnt anything inside of me and I'm really shy and closed. So I;m wondering how to send the message to everyone around me that I'm friendly and open. Also if it helps I'll be staying with a family member at this new town due to financial reasoning since living at the dorms are too expensive for my family.



I think one of my biggest worries is that everyone in my classes already sort of know each other as acquaintances and will form their own groups of friendship. 

There are list on my goals I'm planning to do over the summer which includes eating healthier and getting fit. I've been lurking around the the sub femalefashionadvice for advices on how to dress because I dress very sloppy in just flare jeans and a zip up sweater.

I know I'm a mess but please help me on how to look friendly to others. Like sometimes it is frustrating for me since it seems I somehow I unknowingly alienate everyone around me. If it helps I'll be studying business (Also can anyone tell if I need business style clothing for first year university...I'm not sure if there will mandatory events to attend...if so please give suggestions for business style clothing since I always was a jeasns and sweatershirt girl).

However, i came to a few (warped) conclusions, and this has helped me enormously in my progress.

1.) Be Happy. Theres really no point in doing anything if you arent happy about it. Hate your job? Logic tells you to quit it. Hate your life? Stop doing what you do then. Which brings us to our next point.

2.) You want to be something you are not? change. Change is scary. We all get that. But you have to. You have to completely stop doing the thing that is harming you.

BUT IVE TRIED TO CHANGE. You cry. Ive lost weight, gotten better grades, spend less time on the computer. But nothings worked! I still have no friends, cant talk to people.

3.)(This is where things get a little warped). This is how you change. By [20/80 rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). Most people react to this rule, subconsciously. When you think someone is almost fully confident, he does not have to be confident 100% of the time. But rather he has to be confident only 20% of the time. 

So, Does that mean that if i want to appear/be confident i only need to do it 20% of the time? YES. This means, you have to spend 16 minutes every hour dedicated to that one task, to seem as though you are it 80% of the time. However this also means one thing. Every other thing you do also adds on to that scale. if you spend 20% of your time feeling confident, but you spend the other 50% wallowing in self pity, you will appear 87% pathetic. 

And the thing is even if you spend 20% of your time being confident(or whatever you have trouble/struggling with), even a small amount of a opposing feel would cripple  you so much. this is because that it grows at an exponential rate, 5% would probably around 40%. and this will seriously stunt your growth.

My friends and I were discussing yesterday; two main points that came up were:

* Is it okay to ask random girls out for dates
* Should it be done through text or real life?

**So, anecdote:**

The reason we brought this discussion up was because I asked a girl out at the gym I do not know at all. I once before introduced myself and made some small talk to see if there was any positive feedback. She was smiling throughout the (short) conversation we had and I was attracted to her so I thought it was okay to ask her out for a cup of coffee to get to know her and see if our personalities clicked. At the time she said yes and I gave her my number fully aware she *may or may not* call me. 

Now it's been two weeks and she hasn't called me and that's fine. Plenty of things could've happened (I'm Dutch, she's  a German exchange student on her break so it's likely she's in Germany right now or maybe she's just not interested)  My friends say she's dodging me because I made things awkward which I find hard to believe considering she has a gym membership for a year, here.

**Their views:**

To relate this back to the anecdote; they say I should've gotten her number first. That I should've gotten to know her through text to make her feel at ease and then eventually ask her out.

**My views:**

It's okay to just ask someone out for coffee after introducing yourself and you like said person after the introduction. There's no need to do it through text because text is impersonal and dodgy. It's easier to hide yourself there plus asking someone in real life implies bravery that a lot of people struggle with. Dates were made for getting to know other people.

I'm not asking you guys for advice; that's not my goal. I have my own believes and I will stick to them. I am however interested in hearing your opinions plus I'm sure there's lurkers out there who will take something from having other people discuss it.

**So, guys:** Is it okay to ask a stranger out (provided the conversation is smooth/she's shown interest). If yes; should it be done in real life or do you get to know them first by asking for their number/facebook and then eventually ask them out?

**Girls:** How do you feel about being asked out by strangers? If you're ok with it, do you want them to ask for your number first so you can talk through ''electronic'' means or do you prefer them to take you out on a date.

**And general:** is it outdated to ask people out for coffee dates? My friends also seemed to imply people don't date anymore; they just meet each other at bars.

The problem is that I am staying at a friend's house where he lives with 6 other people. When I live alone, I don't have any problems taking care of my shit, but being around others makes me feel self conscious and I start making careless mistakes, which in turn make me feel embarrassed and give me a strong desire to go back to being alone where I won't embarrass myself further.

SO here's what happened today:

* I left boxes in front of the cat's litter box and over night the cat shit all over the living room and peed on the floor, and I made its owner late for work as we cleaned it up together.

* I drove another one of the housemates to the airport early this AM, but parked her car in front of a fire hydrant. Nothing bad happened, but it was embarrassing to get a call from a housemate informing me he needed to move it.

* My friend that invited me to stay called me asking about his bike key, which I had accidentally brought home with me on the first visit, and I have no idea what I've done with it.

I had severe problems with social anxiety and attention disorder in highschool and college, and I managed to find a pretty peaceful middle-ground living alone and with my GF. Now that I'm moved, I'm back in a much more social situation and finding myself grappling with all my old issues. I feel myself panicking and worrying way more, feeling embarrassed and making careless mistakes because I'm so preoccupied.

I want to be a normally functioning adult who doesn't cause any problems and will fit in well with a group... but right now I feel mortified and want to go back to SF and not bother anyone.

I know the solution is to just not make these mistakes and stay on top of my shit, but the thing is that I had **no idea** I was parked in front of a fire hydrant or that I left stuff in front of the litter box, like my brain didn't even go through that checklist because its so preoccupied with anxiety and distractions. Making these mistakes after only knowing these people for a couple weeks feels really gross and embarrassing and I'm not sure what I should do to make things right.

Before, when I was younger, I was extremely awkward and in a socially wrong place. After high school, my awkwardness continued for a bit more. It wasn't until end of sophomore year that I cleaned up my act (I made a sub 2.0 GPA during one of my semesters at a low point, big mistake.)

Now I've cleaned up a lot. I've focused on school, in a right place mentally, feel much better, etc. etc. I work out, eat right, have hobbies (I like to write and read) and can do small talk anywhere, anytime, anyplace.

However, I find when attempting to deepen my relationships I get shut down or barred from progression. For instance, I'll have people talk to me casually about their personal lives, their interests, their lives, SO's, hobbies, school (I'm a second semester junior), etc. But when it actually comes to doing things with other people I get the, ""Sorry, no can do"" line.

I'm finding that because it took me so long to right myself, I have to play catch up. But how do you play catch up and break into a circle? I'm finding it immensely difficult, because people already have their established networks.

I try to be ""useful"" to people. I have the answers to homework, go to study groups, take good notes, listen intently, ask questions about others. When I share *my* life though, I feel like I just get disinterest, so nowadays I honestly don't even bother bringing up myself because I can see the eyes glossing over. 

And that brings me roundabout to square one. I can't seem to build rapport, can't seem to break in, but always get to play ""that guy I know in class"" or ""that guy from my club"" or ""that guy I met"". It never progresses.

When I was younger, I had it very easy because my school was small and all my classmates grew up together. It was basically a built in network. I moved away though, but when I look back (occasionally on Facebook) I see the same *exact* group of friends who're still friends.

I'm at a loss. This year I'm supposed to be applying to grad schools and most likely I could end up farther away, again, possibly even study in another country (I'm in the U.S.) I don't know what to do anymore. 

I've tried clubs, going out myself, internet, being friendly, faking it until I became it (worked to a point), networking...

And yet I'm still at home on a Saturday night. Can anyone chime in?

A few month ago, I've made the realization that I had zero social skills. I don't know why, but I was still able to make some friends throughout my life, but they are too few and even though I really like them, I would like to have some closer friends or be closer to them.
I would like the kind of friend who text you every day, who asks if you want to hang out, go watch a movie. Friends with whom you can have a deep talk about anything, or juste have a laugh for no reason.

I myself am quite stuck-up, and I decided to take improv class to learn to enjoy social interactions and feel in control of myself.
I also realize that I wasn't a good listener, and I decided to make some effort on that part, thanks to ""how to make friends and influence people"".

So now I've learn how to make somebody talk about themselves, but I still have a hard time transitioning to a conversation on an abstract topic where both listen to each others. I don't really mind letting the other do all the talking, I feel I have more to learn by listening then by talking and it gives me less chance to make a fool out of myself. But still I feel like I'm just the guy people go to unwind and not a friend, and ultimately, they get bored with me.

But when I do try to talk, I often find myself with nothing more to say in the middle of an exchange. Really literally nothing, the other will be waiting and I'll juste have nothing more to say.

I didn't use to care about all these things before, and I didn't feel like I was having so much problems.

Except recently, when I've been launched far, far out of my comfort zone.  

Today was my first day in lab ever since I started my exchange program abroad, and wow. I am so out of my element. I don't speak the country's language (I was told this was not necessary when I applied for the position since most people speak English; however, the level of proficiency is highly variable). Regardless, how the exchange program usually works is the host lab you choose assigns you a project for the summer and they help you out and get you going with it. For me, this is apparently the first time the lab I chose had ever hosted an exchange student, so I feel like they're not really sure what to do with me.  

I'm going to cry if any of them are redditors and see this, ogod.  

Anyways, the lab director tells me just very generally to start talking with some of the students, see what kinda projects are going on in the lab, and find something that interests me. This makes me so incredibly anxious for the following reasons:  

1) The language barrier! It's hard enough trying to get a conversation with some of the students just talking about easy peasy life things. It'll be near impossible trying to get a scientific conversation going. I'm absolutely terrified of how awkward this situation can so very quickly and easily become.    

2) This program is supposed to be a give/take sort of thing. As in, they give me a project that helps their research, I get knowledge and hands-on experience from them. Through this route, I feel like I'm just take-take-taking. I asked the best english speaker today if he could walk me through some of what he's working on, and he seemed really happy to oblige which I thought was great, so I ask him ""When are you free?"" and he says ""How about day after tomorrow?"" They're all so busy and so hardworking! I'm just getting in the way like an annoying hassle. And if I decide to help out on any of their projects, which I'll most likely have to do eventually if I want to do anything besides reddit all day, they'll be even more annoyed at me because they'll have to spend more time teaching me stuff or answering my numerous questions or things like that because I'm an undergraduate with little to no knowledge of any of the sort of stuff they're doing.

TL;DR -- **Help!** I need so much of it. I'm trying to yell at myself thinking that I'm throwing away this amazing opportunity if I don't just get out of my damn shell and start talking with these people, but once I actually walk into the lab I lose all sense of confidence I may have had and start over terrified. These thoughts just keep coming back to me. It's all so hard D;.  ",,False,,t5_2r275,False,,,True,t3_vmik4,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/vmik4/i_need_some_advicesupporthugs/,

For example, I consider myself outgoing, friendly, funny, and very social. However, I am not sure how to communicate effectively with certain personalities (shy, angry, pretentious) or in situations (family deaths, business parties, overseas). In my time on this subreddit and 'ask reddit', I've tried some new things that I haven't done before with resounding success. Here's why:

First of all, humans are social beings. I love to talk to people and meet new characters from all over. I know shy people are difficult to talk with, but I try and make myself as friendly and engaging as possible. So before you hesitate to go out and speak with people on random occasions, remember that most people you meet will be delighted for a discussion. Example:

I moved to a state where I didn't know a soul (Montana). Luckily I was in a heavily frequented tourist area (north of Yellowstone) full of seasonal and part time employees (like myself). So one thing I tried doing was... going to bars, by myself. Sounds intimidating, but I went on occasions. I am a big sports fan, and have been going to random bars to watch the NBA playoffs, Hockey, or other shit. Most importantly, I found, is that there are other people at these bars also interested in the games on television. So I would sit at the bar, order a delicious Cold Smoke Scoth Ale, and notice people around me. If someone was watching the game, I'd ask ""Who are you going for"" ""I'm a Heat fan"" ""Oh cool, I'm going for the Spurs but I don't care really, I'm more of a football fan but since that season is over, I've been getting into Basketball"" ""Ya I've been following them too/Ya I like football too/Cool man"" 

The ice has been broken. Then I go ""Where ya from?"" ""(Location)"" ""Oh cool, nice area"" ""what about you?"" ""I'm from Nashville"" ""Ah, Music City, huh?"" ""Sure is, I used to be an audio engineer for the Grand Ole Opry and played music with some dudes like Vince Gill"" ""holy shit, tell me more""

Thus, in the course of 3  minutes, I have actively engaged a stranger by: Addressing them through situation, being interested in who they were, and conversing on interesting and relevant topics.

So here's a challenge to those who get socially anxious about being social... alone! Try a place or event that holds your interests (concert, game, church, school, whatever) and do the most important thing you can get from someone: LEARN! Learn who they are, what they do, and how they do it. Take this interest, and reflect on it. This is the EASIEST way to make friends outside of your work/school/family setting. After 8 months of living where I am, I know about 100 people by their first name and communicate with them on very friendly levels. It's easy, you just gotta get past your shell.

I play a lotta Starcraft 2, and there is one quote that the Dark Templars say that I take to heart : ""Fear is an illusion""

That's true! Fear prohibits us from doing what we want. The reason you might not be as outgoing or social as you want is because your hesitant or nervous, which stems from FEAR. Don't be afraid - at 23, I moved to the middle of nowhere Montana and made a life for myself. Just be brave, and of course, have a lot of :

Confidence

Don't get cocky or over-arrogant, but be proud and happy of who you are, what you like, and what you do.

I play video games (i'm close to beating Skyrim, I think), but some people limit themselves to just this... At the same time, I love music (Nashville boy) so I go to a lot of musical events and meet really cool people. I play the guitar and fiddle, and have on several occasions hosted Jam Sessions with people I've never met before here in MT. I did this using Craigslist and Meetup. It's that easy. Now I have bands I play with for fun, and have greatly improved my musical abilities.
I also like sports, and play a lot of basketball. I play at a couple of gyms here which host 'open nights' so I can just drop in and play a pickup game. I've met some really cool GUYS (as a male it's hard to make guy friends, I've found) and we now play games together once a week at the gym (which is free! just bring a ball). At the same time, I exercise a lot and have met just about everyone who goes to the gym I go to. I know the owner and workers, and by just showing up 3-4 times a week, I've gotten to become great friends with other people. I found success here, and the shape my body is in makes me extremely confident!
Lastly, I love history and astronomy, so I spend a lot of time volunteering at a local history museum and observatory. I've met great (older) people who have mentored me and helped me learn about the area and improve my museum skills. I also volunteer at an animal shelter and have met some cool older people too. It's hard to do stuff with these folks outside of the volunteering, but I am in constant contact with people due to these activities.

So, by being active in my interests and hobbies, I have built up a lot of confidence just by meeting and hanging out with other people. And these are people I don't even work with!  My confidence and passions show and shine through, and I'm happy to say the past 8 months have been a great success.

On a personal level, I did meet a girl, and we have gotten very close. I love her dearly, which is reciprocated, and it's all because one day at work (we work at the same place) I went up to her and said, ""Hey you're pretty cute! do you drink Cold Smokes?"" Needless to say, we've been dating for the past few months, and I'm having a blast with what we do. Fishing, hiking, dancing GALORE. what a dream I am living!



That being said, I challenge you guys who are on the crusp of overcoming that binding anxiety, that doubt in your head. Try this:

Tonight: Go to a bar and/or grill, sit at the bar, and order a tall frosty ale or Jack and Coke (or whatever). Look what game is on TV, find the people next to you watching the game and just start talking about it. If you don't like sports, just say 'I'm not a big sports fan but these guys are super over-paid. Have you seen how much Lebron James makes a year?'

That's the start of your first bloom. If you don't like bars, go to where people are on a night in your town. Concerts, movies, malls. Invite a friend. Have fun. be confident.


Other part of social bloom? Don't tell me that you don't have interests! Most of you have spent at LEAST 20 years on this planet. That means you're interested in SOMETHING. Find that interest and related activities and go do it. People will join you. just go!

What's holding you back? Anxiety? Inexperience?

Remember: Fear is an illusion. Your whole life could change like *THAT* if you just open yourself up and try something new. If you're sick of the same old thing, embrace change.

I've started working on fixing my problems, eating better, working out, and looking for counseling options (I used to go to my schools counselor but I can't go back until I'm re-enrolled).  The change I'm having the most problem with is getting back out and socializing.  

I have enough social skills that I know how to have conversations and be friendly with people, my biggest problem is that I don't know where to go to meet people.  Even though I live in a college town it's still a pretty small town with very little social hot spots, the friends that I used to go out with have all moved away (either dropping out or transferring schools).  I want to start making friends again, getting dates, having sex!  I miss these things but I don't know how to start doing them.

Sorry I hope this isn't too much to read.  

If so  TL;DR: How do I get out?  Where do I go? What do I do?  ",,False,,t5_2r275,False,,,True,t3_183z08,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/183z08/id_like_to_start_getting_out_again_but_i_dont/,

A few days ago she told me that she kinda liked me and hinted at going more then friends. 

Naturally i just changed myself into a ""wanna be perfect guy to woo her"" which essentially turned out to be ""lame guy shes already starting to forget about"" 

She is a pretty girl so shes got other guys biting at her feet but iv had a crush on her for a long time and I'm trying to seize this opportunity. 


So how can i stay myself when talking to her? Thanks all",,False,,t5_2r275,False,,,True,t3_178meh,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/178meh/how_do_i_act_myself_around_the_girl_i_like/,

The thing with texting is, I can't tell whether I'm annoying, boring, or interfering with the other person. At least face to face it's possible to tell according to their tone, facial expressions, and enthusiasm but almost impossible (for me anyways) to tell over phone about their thoughts on the subject. I also can't come up with anything to talk about when texting without asking them about a hundred questions. I would love any tips or pointers in regards to this.


Thanks in advance. ",,False,,t5_2r275,False,,,True,t3_1782fw,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1782fw/hey_all_got_any_texting_advice/,
