This subreddit is under new management. The previous mods had not signed in for 9+ months, so I got the subreddit. I wanted to both seek the input of the community on the direction this subreddit should go, and put out a bit of where I want it to go.

**Who Am I**

I've been in the online advertising industry since my mid-teens, or for about 9 years now. I currently sell data/software to the online industry. I've mailed(4 years), done SEO(2 years), and done paid advertising (4 years).

**What do I want for this subreddit?**

I'm leaving the direction mostly open to the community. I see my role here mostly as making sure that this subreddit becomes articles about advertising instead of advertisements targeted at advertisers. I'm keeping an eye out, but as always: *please use the ""Report"" button*.

Until we get cleaned up, I'm putting a lockdown on questionable items: Surveys, e-Books, ""give us your e-mail for content"", etc. I will also be ruthless about anything related to MLM or the ""make money online"" niche. This should be a place to read about advertising, not a place to profit off the users.

**So what would you guys like to see moving forward?**

We have a fair number of users, but submissions don't frequently get upvoted. I'm going to take this to mean we have some work to do on getting content that people like to the front page.

*Our Immediate Options Appear to Be:*

* Self Posts/Analysis of Interesting Ads and Trends

* Examples of successful or interesting advertisements.

* Articles about the advertising industry

* Question/Answer Threads(I've seen these become relatively popular)

* Innovative new tools and services(this will require a bit of editorial control on my part to keep the spam to a dull roar)

* Content geared towards beginners

* Content geared towards agencies

* Anything else under the sun.

**Who are you guys?**

If you'd like please leave a comment saying a little about yourself and what you do so I can get an idea of what type of person inhabits this subreddit. I'm also interested in any other active advertising subreddits that you may be subscribed to.

-----------------------------

Thanks a bunch everyone. I look forward to trying to build this community up with you.

1359657471.0,122,self.advertising,17n5a4,How to tell if your ad concept sucks,hathawayshirtman,138,16,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/17n5a4/how_to_tell_if_your_ad_concept_sucks/,"One of the best skills you can have is to learn how to recognize a good idea. But before you can recognize a good idea, it's best to clear out all the BAD ideas first.

When you make your concept, compare it to these categories:


- **SOUNDS LIKE A PITCH-MAN**

Obvious salesman-speak:

*""Our company provides the greatest service for you""*

*""He's been using Brand X. Introducing the all-new Brand Y!""*

*""Consumer Reports gives it a five-star rating!""*

*""Act now and get this absolutely free!""*

It can also take forms in other ways:

Asking a question — *""Have too many zits? Then try all-new Zit Creme 1000!""*

Gratuitous displays of scantily-clad women.

Offering money-back guarantees, and sales discounts.


- **BORING**

This happens when the ad is too straight. There's no ""wink,"" no heartfelt truth. Just a display of the product and its features. Yawn.

*""Use Mobile Checking with First Financial Trust.""*


- **TOO EASY**

Miracle Grow made your houseplants push through the roof? You're the 50,000th person to think of that. Your first ideas are typically the easy ones. Write them down, sleep on it. Tomorrow you'll think of something even better while in the shower.


- **OVERLY CUTE**

Babies. Talking animals. I know they do this crap on the Superbowl, but those are top senior-level guys who are allowed to do that. Never *ever* put this in your book unless you're an ad genius.


- **BORROWED INTEREST**

Superheros. Aliens. Sasquatch. Celebrities. They have too much of their own thing going on, so they distract from the message. At best, it dilutes the creative, at worst, it causes brand confusion (HUGE no-no). This category is repeatedly offended with large agencies—especially with celebrities. You may have to work on a project with one. But don't put it in your book; it shows recklessness with budget, and distracts from the concept. Just because others do it, doesn't mean it's good.


- **FAKE SCENARIO**

These are situations that are either impossible, or seem imposed. In essence, it's a lie. Lies are not a good thing, people are already wary of advertising as it is.

*""Because you're on your fourth latte.""* This is not true; I hate milk and drink only espresso.

*""George kissed his wife and went to work.""* George doesn't exist!

*""Women will notice you.""* Yeah right. (Note that Axe deodorant does this, but they do it as a well-crafted ""joke"" that is directly tied to their brand position, knowing that the viewer knows it's not serious. THAT's the only reason why it works. If Axe was totally serious about that claim, it would fail.)


- **CONFUSING**

If you have to explain your ad for more than five seconds to the person you're presenting to, it's probably too complicated. This typically happens when the ""wink"" is buried too far (like a too-long, rambling joke), or if you're trying to shoehorn a lot of messages into one.


- **TOO WEIRD**

This is a combination of various levels of ""borrowed interest,"" ""fake scenario"" and ""confusing."" Weirdness for the sake of weirdness (like Douglas Adams style humor) may be funny by itself, but it doesn't strike a chord of truth. So it falls flat when applied to an advertisement.


- **BEEN DONE BEFORE**

It could be the best ad in the world. But if someone else did it (even if you never saw the other ad before), you have to throw it out. Let it go. It's happened to all of us.

As a lawyer, I've been approached by a couple of digital firms to represent them in contract negotiations and other legal matters.

One of my clients was asked to present a Facebook strategy for a major worldwide brand. The brand is represented, in our market, by an affiliate to a global agency. My client presented a general strategy with specific Facebook executions. The presentation was a hit, but the brand confessed that they did no have the budget to proceed. 

My client and the brand agree to revisit the matter in the near future. Problem... the brand begins to post my client's facebook strategy ""ad verbatim"" in their Facebook page without compensation. Not once, or twice... they post the exact same material my client proposed at least 7 times. They even ignored a cease and desist notice.

So we send a legal claim to the brand and the agency, asking for a $7,500 settlement. And today they responded, with a counter offer of $900.00. Motherfuckers...

1369400942.0,65,self.advertising,1eyvaj,Real advice for newbies (and some oldies) in the industry,startinggl0ry,71,6,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1eyvaj/real_advice_for_newbies_and_some_oldies_in_the/,"First off, remember this a job. We work to live; we don't live to work. 

Stay passionate. We all have worked long and hard, and it doesn't necessarily taper off as you move up the ladder. The good leaders in an agency are those who are senior and still staying late to help out the jr team. Bosses are the ones that tell everyone what to do and then step away. There is a difference, and you will encounter a plethora of each type in the ad world. 

Dig deep. Learn about your company, clients, the industry, your clients' industry. You'd be surprised how little tidbits of information can change an entire strategy and highlight you as an asset in the company. The ones that do this can move quickly-- very quickly. Advertising is probably the only space where you can go from ""assistant"" in your title to ""senior"" in your title within 2 years. 

Take criticism professionally. A rock that has been smoothed by the weathering tends to be more appealing to the eye than one with rough edges. The scrutiny is just helping you smooth out your rough edges. NEVER take it personally, even if the person telling you means it personally. 

Respect everyone. Juniors, seniors, clients, smarties, idiots. Everyone. We all move around a lot in the industry and at the end of the day it's a small community. That guy you just told off? Could be working client side in a couple of years and decide to pass you over or make your life a living hell. (Seen that happen a couple of times now.) Your name is your brand, and it better have a strong positive sentiment behind it if you expect to move high up the ladder. 

Read. Read everything you can get your hands on, even if you disagree with it. Again, the more you know, the better. In order to be creative, on the creative side, strategy side, media side, etc., you have to be able to draw on a wide base of knowledge. 

Learn (some of) the analytics. It's important to know what your clients and others are judging a campaign on at the end of the day, and I can tell you it's not *just* how cool the ad is. If it's not profitable in the long run, it's not worth it. Learn the KPIs and develop around them. To that point, ""branding"" is a cop out. There is always a more specific goal for every campaign. 

Learn the media. Not just what each media generally works well for, but how it works. The digital space is a perfect example. On the surface its roses and sunshine, but pull the wraps off and it looks like the wild west. Do you really know where your ad is running? Do you really know who you're targeting? Is this too much retargeting? Too little? Are vendors competing for the same inventory, driving your costs up? Is your creative built properly for the inventory you're accessing? Ask these questions, even if it's not necessarily ""your job"". 

Respect the differences between the media team and the creative team. Advertising is art and science, and the industry doesn't survive without both. Everyone has their differences, but don't let those differences become a blindness. I can't tell you how many times someone has complained about ""shitty media planners who sit on their ass all day and only work hard when its to arrange a lunch, dinner, or go to an upfront,""  OR ""siloed creatives who only care about their pet project even though it doesn't fit anywhere in the actual campaign."" It goes both ways, and all it does is show how naive someone truly is when they make statements like this. 

Appreciate your agency. They invested a lot of time and money in you. It's easy to get a big head in this industry and chase dollars. Let me save you the suspense-- it's much easier to get underpaid to work with people you love than take home big paycheck and hate where you spend 40-70 hours of your life each week. 

I could probably write a lot more, but I'd rather everyone throw in some of their own advice. Positive advice.

This is my first post here, but I'd like to suggest an idea. How about we make an advertising contest between us ? 

Every then and now, a topic, brand or product would be proposed to us and we submit commercial scripts. The idea is to have some fun and try to train ourselves a bit !

I'm working now in an agency specialized in fiction that also does some brand content and advertising. For the first theme, I'd suggest to create a commercial about something that can't be on TV or never appears on it. For instance, cigarettes. I made a small script about a commercial I wrote a few days ago, that's way I'm suggesting this.. (feel free to comment it!). 

What do you think ?

1332948848.0,49,self.advertising,rhnau,"An ad oldster with some thoughts for ad youngsters. Also, AMA. ",gregtmills,54,5,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/rhnau/an_ad_oldster_with_some_thoughts_for_ad/,"So, I like the subreddit. I like that there's people asking questions and getting answers. I feel like I'm probably on the outer limit, age-wise, of people participating here. So, indulge me while I pretend to be wise. 

Background: I'm 42. Been in and around agencies of different sizes for... 16 years? I'm old/young enough to be of the first ad generation to be exposed to the web as an ad medium. My first job as a junior copywriter was to be 'digital'. At the time that was banners and text-links.

**How to look for an entry level creative job**: Find out who the CREATIVE SERVICES MANAGER is, or if that person doesn't exist, the RECRUITER. Deal with that person. Creative Directors, unless they're nice people, will kick your stuff to them anyway. They can be a great ally and the best ones are genuinely interested in cultivating talent, especially in 'ad towns'.

**PRINT and TV, if not dead, are very, very ill.**: Don't worry, there's still plenty of opportunity to go on shoots and eat craft services. The media models are crumbling into the sea. Magazines and TV are still part of the pool, but their share will get smaller and smaller, thus their ROI for clients will get smaller and smaller. The networks are starting to get that, and are just now taking online content development seriously.
If you really want to make yourself useful, steep yourself in the digital landscape. There are still plenty of older ad folks who really don't get this stuff. Until these fine folks have left the scene, digital literacy is going to be a premium. Use it to your advantage.

**NOT ALL AD SCHOOLS ARE THE SAME:** Creative Circus, Miami Ad School, Weiden's program - good. ""Art Institute of Creative Arts New Media University College"" or whatever, are usually a rip-off. (Have you noticed how crappy their ads are? QED, mfer.) If you're interested in design, go to a four college - Rhode Island, Cal Poly SLO, Cranbrook. Note that design and art direction are complimentary disciplines, but a lot of great conceptual art directors can't design their way out of a paper bag.

One thing about ad schools is graduates' books tend to look the same: great headline, great visual. Fine work if you can get it, but the reality of the world is that's a reasonable solution in about 40% of the work.

Art Directors: learn how to deal with words.

Copywriter: Lean how to write longer chunks of copy. And become familiar how journalism works. Advertising copy is a highly corrupt form of journalism.

**IS AD SCHOOL ESSENTIAL?**: Handy, but not essential. It's handy because you become familiar with how briefs work, and you get to work with a partner. It's also handy because GOOD ad schools can help get your work in front of people who can get you jobs. Before you enroll in ad school, find out what sort of interaction they have with the local ad community - portfolio reviews, speaker series, whatever.
Personally, I'm more interested in people that have a little weirder grain. If you can think like a story teller and you're smart, you can learn the rest of the junk. Other degrees are good too.
If your program offers MFAs in copywriting or art direction , you are being ripped off.

**KNOW HOW BUSINESS WORKS**: Take a few courses at your local college if you're out of school. You're actually aiming to be a type of business consultant, literally an ad agent. And once you're attached to a client, do as much research as you can stomach about their category, and their company history - if for no other reason than to not confuse their rival's CEO with their CEO, and then blather on loudly and self-importantly in a meeting with said client, like I have done.

Have a rudimentary understanding of merchandizing, supply chain stuff, marketing beyond advertising, packaging, etc.

**DOES BEING AN MBA HELP?** Helps if you're on the account side, or the planning side, and you want to progress at a big shop. But I wouldn't say it's essential.

**IF YOU AREN'T INTERESTED IN BEING STUCK IN A COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALITY, HOLD OUT FOR THE JOB IN A GENERAL AGENCY** Direct mail, business to business, events, pharmaceutical -- OOF. If you want to do general advertising, hold out until you can get a job at a general agency. It can be tough to get good, universally relatable work out of a speciality shop, so your ambitions are different, avoid these places. It can be difficult to switch out.

**CAN I BE FAMILY ORIENTED?** Some agencies are better than others hours wise. I worked every day for about five month straight at one point, leaving at midnight three times a week on average. This was an unusual situation, admittedly. It was a new shop and there were a lot of pitches. But advertising can be very demanding. It can take you out of town for a month, it can be financially annoying when you're loaning money to the agency so you can go on a trip just to do your job, it doesn't care about kids' bdays and wedding anniversary. It's not a universal truth, and different agencies have different cultures, but anyone who has been in the ad business for a while has a horror stories.

**WHAT SORT OF PERSON THRIVES IN ADVERTISING?** Curious people. People who spend a lot of time reading, watching, listening to media. People interested in culture. People interested in how other people think and perceive. People with extremely broad interests.

**ONE MORE THING: THE CONTENT SPECIALIST MAY BE GOING AWAY:** I mean like in ten years or something. Brand agencies will start to evolve more toward branded content studios, with more emphasis on creating entertainment.

That's all I can think of for now. Please don't hesitate to ask questions.

I'm an art director, I work at a ""big name"" agency in London and have about five years experience under my belt. I've won a couple of awards (nothing big though), graduated first place at [Award school](http://www.awardschool.com.au/index.php?p=28) in my state (Sydney) and studied graphic design at university - plus done extra courses along the way in web, idea generation and social. 

Yet, on average, most days at work I feel like a fraud. A creative imposter. One who has somehow been caught up in an accidental career, managing to be in the right place at the right time. I also feel that every ""success"" I have at my craft is just a close shave, a relief that I wasn't exposed for the hack that I am.

**Is this normal?** Am I just lacking confidence? (I'm not a naturally confident person fwiw) Can anybody else relate to this, or at least offer any advice?

My main issue is the lack of a work/life balance - there are so many things I'd like to do with my life that I can't ever set out to do because I lack a consistent schedule...or even more simply, its impossible to live a healthy lifestyle with the hours and the stress of agency life.

I'm 24 - I want to date, get a dog, be able to actually use my gym membership, be able to eat dinner before 10pm for once, just live a normal and healthy life - is this unrealistic?  

Yeah, I can wear whatever to work and there is beer on Friday, but at what cost? 

How does anyone raise a family with these hours?

This year has gone by very very quickly, and all I have to show for it is being out of shape, energy deprived, and miserable with a slight substance abuse problem - I'm terrified that I'm going to blink and be 30 sitting in the same studio apartment alone and the only thing to show for it being a better job title and a few more grand in the bank.

Does anyone in this industry work 9-5? 

Am I being unrealistic?

Really? You couldn't put a sticker? Instead, you had to waste materials and create a permanently obnoxious cry for attention. 

I work in advertising and even though I found it annoying, I felt I had to cap it and see what level of disappointment awaited me on the other end. 

I was not let down. After the 45 seconds it took to actually cap the damn thing, it was just a page that informed me about the type of materials used to create the hat, and that some of them were recycled. Brilliant. Such a wasted opportunity. As are 99.9% of QR codes used in advertising. They are rarely effective, and more often than not, only used because a client has heard about them and wants to try out the new hotness - even though it has nothing to do with the creative execution or messaging.

Go ahead, put it in a headlock, give it a noogie. I'm going to start my hunt for a junior position/internship this summer. I hope to be sending links off to some people in the next few weeks. Before I do, I'd love to hear what /advertising has to say.

Also, I'm a bit timid to make my jump into the big city (Toronto). I feel I'm a pretty smart dude with versatile abilities. I want to make the right first moves, not pouncing on whatever moves. I seriously want a mentor, from what I've heard a lot of places nowadays don't really foster that environment—advice there would also be great.

**[Everything is Obvious (Once You Know The Answer)](http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B004T4N672), Duncan J Watts**

Watts explains why most planning is bullshit and most of our explanations for results are just post hoc rationalizations.

**[Connected, the Surprising power of our social networks](http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B002V18B3E), Nicholas Christakas and James Fowler**

Book is about network science and explains how almost all of our actions are unwittingly affected by people we know and people we dont know

The OG book on Network Theory. It's a bit dated, but is a good starters guide to the subject

**[Bursts](http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B003KWH13O), Albert-Laszlo Barabasi**

An update to Linked. It seems like part 2 of a 3 part series. It starts to connect a lot of dots

**[Subliminal](http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B007NKZ1RW), Leonard Mlodinow**

A great book on how our emotional brain is responsible for almost all of our decisions. 

**[Predictably Irrational](http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B002V0GCE0), Dan Ariely**

More on the nuncios/emotional brain. A lot of good research that adds to the theory that our emotional brain is at the core of our decisions and our rational brain is just good at rationalizing those decisions.

**[You're Not So Smart](http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B006K4GN56), David McRaney**

Really easy/quick/consumable read. Each chapter is a new common misconception (e.g. The Misconception: We think when we lean something new we remember that we were once wrong about it. The truth: Due to the Hindsight bias we often look back on what we just learned and assumed we knew it the whole time)

**[Grouped](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_10?asin=B006C258Z2&amp;qid=1361979247&amp;sr=1-10), Paul Adams**

Very consumable, short book that touches on network theory and why/how people spread information. Paul is not a scientist, he works at Facebook and is a pretty smart guy, but the book is more of a synthesis of other peoples research (not that that is a bad thing).

**[The Righteous Mind](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B008O8964Q&amp;qid=1361980538&amp;sr=1-1
), Jonathan Haidt**

Haidt opens with the idea that moral intuition is the basis of our decisions and rational thought is just justification of that intuition. He then goes on to describe his moral foundation theory - the idea that our ethics come from 6 basic pillars. 

**[Strategic Truth Lies and Advertising, Jon Steel](http://www.amazon.com/Truth-Lies-Advertising-Account-Planning/dp/0471189626)**

First off, it's an easy read-entertaining and amusing. More importantly, it's a thorough explanation of strategic account planning.

**[Mythologies by Roland Barthes From 1957](http://www.amazon.com/Mythologies-Roland-Barthes/dp/0374521506)** is a collection of essays around myth creation in modern society through semiotics. Some of it gets a little abstract but I really enjoyed the chapter on soap powder and detergent packaging.

**[Propaganda by Edward Bernays](http://www.amazon.com/Propaganda-Edward-Bernays/dp/0970312598)** If you've seen the Adam Curtis documentary Century Of The Self you'll know all about this guy\book (If you haven't it is a MUST for anyone in media). From today's perspective Propaganda very much on the dark side of mass media\mass persuasion but the dark side is always useful in defining the entirety of a subject. Goebbels loved this book! (OP Comment: Awesome book. Really amazing stuff)

**[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles Mackay](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B003C20SZU&amp;qid=1362448046&amp;sr=1-1)** First published in 1841 this book is surprisingly relevant if you're at all interested in the social psychology behind viral campaigns, fads or any other twenty-first century hysteria.


***Creative***

**[Hey Mr. Whipple, Squeeze This, Luke Sullivan](http://www.amazon.com/Hey-Whipple-Squeeze-This-Creating/dp/0471281395)**
Pretty much an industry standard that will stand the test of time. A must read for any new creative.

**[Made To Stick, Chip and Dan Heath](http://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others/dp/1400064287/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361993100&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=made+to+stick)**
From Amazon: In this indispensable guide, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds–from the infamous “kidney theft ring” hoax to a coach’s lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony–draw their power from the same six traits.

**[A Smile In The Mind by Beryl McAlhone and David Stuart One](http://www.amazon.com/Smile-Mind-Beryl-McAlhone/dp/0714838128)** of the best treatises on humour in the communication arts I've ever picked up. More of a design book but the core insights are just as relevant to copywriters. It's also beautifully designed. 

***Client/Business***

**[Running Lean, Ash Maurya](http://www.amazon.com/Running-Lean-Iterate-Works-OReilly/dp/1449305172)**

From Amazon: Ash takes you through a strategy for achieving a ""product/market fit"" for your fledgling venture, based on his own experience in building a wide array of products.

First, I just wanted to thank everyone for the response we got yesterday. I got a lot of feedback- that's really going to help in determining where to take this subreddit.

There seems to be a lot of energy and interest in building this community up, and that makes me pretty damn excited. So, with that in mind, today I'd like to approach 2 things:

**Building a Better Sidebar**

*Similar Subreddits*

We got a few recommendations for similar subreddits yesterday. We will be adding those(r/AdPorn, r/AdGeek, r/Marketing, r/Media) to the sidebar. If there's any others, please leave a comment for those. 

*Blogs, Magazines, Etc*

There seems to be demand for a lot of different types of content here. If you guys have any websites that put out exceptional articles on advertising, please comment here with them. There's a lot out there in a lot of specialties, and it would probably help a lot of people find better content to submit if we had a running list of places it's likely to be.

I'm going to be reviewing each of these by hand before they go up. Please resist the urge to submit blogs that are run by the company you work for or clients, unless it's truly out of the ordinary in terms of quality.


**User Flair/Specialties**

We had some people who were kind enough to share their job titles yesterday, and someone had the idea of incorporating that into flair. I really like this idea. I will go through yesterday's thread to add flair for the people who gave me enough information, but if you would like your specialty/job to appear next to your username, please post here with the information.

We're looking for things like ""Graphics Design"", ""Creatives"", ""Media Buyer"", and optionally the company you work for. Allowing the company name is kind of an experiment; hopefully by giving people a way to comment with that added we can help make posting here something that is actually constructive for business we can avoid spammy and self-serving submissions. If you're like me and would prefer not to have the company listed, that's also fine.

Thanks a bunch everyone!

So the family needed a loan for the camera?

Some background: I've been in the industry for 3 years now in account management. In this role, I've helped lead the way for a couple of campaign, product and initiative launches. However, despite some of the small successes I've had in this area, I've always had becoming a planner/strategy person as my final goal. My passion has always been coming up with a big idea that helps a client towards their goal. The main thing is that I honestly don't know how to get there.


Any planners/strategists want to give their 2 cents on how to get into that aspect of the industry? Thanks in advance.

I'm getting sick of it, but trying to figure out if it's the job itself or just my agency.

How do you spend a majority of your time?  Here is how I spend mine:

-  5% media strategy, brainstorming, research
-  15% media buying process/vendor relations:  writing, sending, tracking rfps and rfp responses from potential vendors, meeting with vendors, talking with vendors
- 80% administrative bullshit and data entry in some for another:  creating insertion orders, signing them, keeping track of them, tweaking/editing them, creating media plans in excel, tweaking/editing the media plan, pulling performance reports and formatting them, getting media authorization forms signed by the client, billing and invoicing reconciliation, etc etc etc.

I guess my question is, how is your day broken out?  What do you spend the bulk of your time on in media?

Also, how many media plans do you ""oversee"" at once?  2?  3?  12?

I'm a strategic planner at one of the largest ad agencies...been thinking about the likes/dislikes of working in an agency. **What are yours?** 

Mine, from a planner's POV:

**What do I like about it?**

I love talking to people and getting new insights and behaviors from them. Things that might be painstakingly obvious that I brushed over, and things that might be completely new to me. I love finding the connections. 

I love brainstorming. Getting to hear ideas from other people and building on top of each other. I love the teamwork aspect. I love the respect that comes out of a good brainstorm. (On the dislike part, there is also a lot of disrespect. Sometimes more than respect.)

I like the excitement when you see a good creative work from an idea. 

I like the pitch process (I know, I know) -- the freshness that comes from it. The different perspectives. The we’re-all-in-this-together mentality.

I like understanding business issues and how to answer to that. I like the reminder that we are in this not only for creative purposes, but for building brands and businesses. 

**What do I dislike about it?**

I dislike the bullshit factor. I knew that when I was going into this industry, there would be a lot of bullshit spewing about in advertising. And while that is half true, quite a bit of it irks me. Makes me feel wrong. 

I dislike the egos. We’re in an industry that straddles art and commerce, and oftentimes at the end, falls on the latter. People forget that we’re still a business. 

I dislike the judgment. We’re also in the business of judging. Not simply judging ads and creative work, but judging people. People are expected to talk, even when they have nothing good to say. People are remembered for the one slightly-less intelligent comment that they make.

The heartbreaking de-motivation when an idea becomes scratched and re-written to its skeletal core. What was something beautiful with great potential is unappreciated. While I understand that ad people sometimes are too “creative” and become dis-engaged with general public, it is heartbreaking to see something you get so excited about become something you dread to look at.

Advertising is prostitution."" -Todd Ziaja",Ledatru,17,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/m15n5/art_is_masturbation_advertising_is_prostitution/,"On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to hear [Todd Ziaja](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/todd-ziaja/4/170/b47) from [Razorfish](http://www.razorfish.com/) talk about his life, his agency, and his work.

Towards the end of his presentation, he shared with us a quote that he personally came up with: **“Art is masturbation. Advertising is prostitution.”**

At first, it just seemed like a silly quote. But on second thought, it’s actually very true.

Art is something you do to please *yourself*. Advertising is something you do to please *others*.

Todd says we all need to have that personal outlet where we make shit however *we* want to make it, without worrying about what anyone else thinks.

Advertising, on the other hand, is coming up with shit that *other* people will like.

For me, my art is my music. My art is my drawings. These are things that I do for me and me only. I don’t care what anyone else thinks, because I do it for me.

In my portfolio class, my job is to make things that other people will like. It doesn’t matter at all what I like. I might love the color blue, but if it doesn’t appeal to my target audience, I won’t use it. I might be in love with a new font that I created, but if no one else likes it, I’m dropping it.

I like both. I like pleasing myself, because it’s genuinely fun and I can do whatever I want. I like pleasing others, because it gives me a satisfying feeling.

-  Google keyword tool - The standard for free keyword research tool
-  Google Trends (previously Google Insights) - See a brands interest level over time through an index based on search volume. Great for preliminary research

I can't help but roll my eyes whenever I hear/see one on the radio or on TV. They all seem extremely obvious and the context of how they make the segue into their product makes ABSOLUTELY no sense at all. The commercials all seem confused too. Theyre all shot cinematically, in a serious way, but the context of the story seems to be trying to be ""funny"". It's the type of ""funny"" that makes any disney channel show with its canned humor seem like Jim Gaffigan or Louis C.K. stand-up.

 Here's your typical McDonalds commercial: Random un-related dilemma between main character and other character. ""I just bought (item) for a buck on the McDonalds Dollar Menu. So I must be smart! DERP DERP"". Main character then solves said problem.

....Wow, not only am I embarrassed that a marketing exec from the worlds largest fast food chain said ""Welp! Thats good enough! Lets put it on TV!"" but I feel almost insulted that they think anyone is dumb enough to say ""Whoa Im a genius because I bought small frys and a shitty cheeseburger for 2 dollars"". They must think we're idiots, I mean seriously who would not get extremely annoyed by these commercials. I know some of you will say ""It doesnt matter if the commercial annoys you, its the fact that youre thinking about it"".  Bullshit. I rarely eat fast food but I must say, McDonalds makes some tasty shit, THAT is the selling point for me not some quirky little bullshit scenario that makes absolutely no sense. McDonalds should be emphasizing more on describing the taste and quality of their product, NOT coming up with a shitty [""Oh You!""](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/oh-you-show.jpg) exchange between two nimrods.

The thing that really made me realize they've hit rock bottom, was a recent radio commercial they put out. It starts with two people talking. The guy goes ""ELLO GUVNUH"" in the most obnoxious forced cockney accent i've ever heard. The commercial then continues with: ""Whats with the accent?"" ""OH LUV, JUST TRYNA SOUND SMART I IS"" ""oh well then why dont you just try THE MCDONALDS DOLLAR MENU TO FEEL SMART"" or something along those lines. At first I thought, okay theyre capitalizing on mainstream America's recent asphyxiation with british accents (seriously wtf is up with that). But further analyzing I realized the irony of using the cockney accent because I'm pretty sure that a cockney accent is the british equivalent of an american southern accent or heavy new york accent (working class) which doesnt really coincide with the stereotypical ""smart"" accent. Not only that but they are stereotyping the british accent as a sign of intelligence. Not to say that british citizens arent intelligent, but it would be like him using a New York accent and saying ""im trying to sound like I'm in the mob"". All this commercial has done is ruin my fuckin day, I dont want mcdonalds at all, I just want these awful commercials to stop.

* It's long hard work for little pay - where is the dream job I thought I would have?

* People don't like my ideas or respect me!

* How long until I get a promotion?

* Are all agencies full of meanies?

So here is a bit of advice. Now it might sound cruel, but sometimes you need to hear a bit of a reality check. 

Advertising is fucking tough. You either have it or you don't. Time and tenure doesn't earn you respect, being fucking good at your job does. I've worked with 60 year olds who were ""Ok"" at their job, and subsequently relegated to working on the small little churn and burn work. And I've worked with 25 year old ECDs who won awards more often than most creative took a shit. 

The point it, Advertising isn't like any other industry. You don't earn your stripes through hard work and determination. You earn your stripes through being good. 

Now, that's not to say there isn't a place for people in this industry that a just good solid employees. In fact, the industry relies on them. If everyone was a high-flyer then none of the real work would get done. Everyone would just sit around thinking up Cannes Lion campaigns and rolling joints in their $100 bills.

What I'm saying is that if you watched Mad Men and thought ""I want to be DON!"" or ""I want to be Peggy"" well here's a reality check. These are the 5%ers. And people can tell pretty damn quickly whether you are in this category or not. 

As for respect, or handling criticism - I'll give you the same advice my first CD gave me. After pinching my arm he said ""Seems thick enough. You'll need it. Because mate, if you don't have a thick skin, there's the fucking door."" Seriously. If you're feelings get hurt because someone didn't like your idea / headline / layout / brief / strategy - perhaps you aren't cut out for this gig. 

I once had an ECD say to me, ""This TVC is the single worst ad I have ever had my name attached to."" How did I respond? Did I cry, did I get hurt feelings? Honestly, yeah - it stung a bit. But I pulled my shit together, nodded my head and said ""Yup - she was pretty bad."" And I moved the fuck on. 

Honestly, if you need to turn to a Reddit forum to ask advice, I would start seriously considering a career shift. 

The number of people who were in my year at Ad School and are still working in the industry is 3. 3 Out of 30. 

**TL;DR - ""If you don't have a thick skin, there's the fucking door.""**

3. Years of industry experience?

The thing is i see a few of my old colleagues winning cannes awards and i feel such a failure.

They have that lion on their book now. They have done it. 

 I know I have strong ideas and am a decent writer but feel shit. 
 I suppose partly I feel my choices have let me down as I haven't worked on anything cannesworthy in a while. 

I feel happy for my mates who have won but also massive burning jealousy and an additional vibe that I have been left behind.

I even have a salary to match it. 

But this last year or so, I've become depressed. I've centered my life around work for so many years that I now feel empty and pointless. None of my coworkers seem to notice, and I'm scared to death that they will. I have no idea what I could do to turn my life around. I think of going for client side, or just do execution at a production agency like B-Reel or Stink. Just to get breathing space and get my life in order.  Long term I still want to work in the industry, but I want to work at a place where I love my coworkers, rather than one that helps me win awards. Right now, going to work sucks. That's not how I want my life to be.

Basically, I'd like to be more involved in campaign development and execution, something which most PR agencies are only now starting to get their heads around. I also want to get involved in business development; I enjoy client-facing roles in which I can manage accounts and present ideas.

Does anyone here have any experience in making a similar transition? I'm putting together a basic portfolio, but is there anything I can be doing in the next couple of months to better prepare myself for a potential interview? Anything I should be reading? Anyone I should be reaching out to?

Great subreddit: a really good mix of sharing between up and comers and veterans alike. I'm an active redditor and an HR manager specializing in recruitment at an ad agency. Throwaway because my main account has too many personal identifiers and opinions. 

I am currently at a large 'traditional' agency, and have also worked with smaller boutique shops and at an ad-focused recruitment firm (though this was not for me, I prefer in-house). I have acted as a general HR manager but my main focus is on finding and recruiting top talent for the agency. I hire in creative, accounts, strategy, production, operations, everything.

Help me do my job better and I'll answer any burning questions you might have. Here are mine:

1) Large shop, or boutique: what are your perceived pros and cons?

2) What was the best/worst experience you had while interviewing in the ad world?

3) Who is doing it right? Which agency seems like an amazing place to work?

4) What is the best way to get a feel for an agency's culture? Do you ask around? Check out the website? Let their work speak for itself?

5) Like I mentioned, I recruit for every role here, so I have to maintain a basic level of knowledge about all of them. However, I can't be an expert everywhere. In your specialty, what is the best question I can ask you to get you talking passionately about your work?

6) What is the best way to approach you with recruitment information? Have you had any really positive or negative experiences with recruiters?

Thanks for your time, and feel free to ask me anything related.

Story inside.,dolphinlemon,12,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1irxrp/really_need_some_advice_story_inside/,"So I went to college in 2006-2011 for Humanities (Popular art/Philosophy) and Spanish. I had no idea what to do so I chose what interested me. Fast forward to Summer 2011, and I moved to NYC with no real plan other than to figure out what I wanted to do. I worked at a few different clothing stores in retail, then I got a lucky break to work in an entry level job in a boutique creative agency.


I never had any experience, but the person who recommended me knew I had a huge interest in how advertising, trends, and the flow of knowledge and communication worked. I was hired for something involving ""Social Media"" for a client who was basically a rich guy trying to advertise a new product that wasn't even out yet. The budget wasn't that high so I figured out ways to make a little buzz on the internet that were sucessfull, but the product still isn't out yet. And, the pay is way down (I won't even be able to pay rent soon). 


I'm very grateful for working there. I learned a lot about advertising. I even helped them come up with an angle for another product they were working for that they actually used! (Didn't get payed for that, just found it interesting) But, I don't know how to write my experience down on paper. I don't have a portfolio.

Questions:

1. In NYC, how would I be able to even make myself sound hireable on paper? I think I'm a very original thinker, but have no way to prove that. I don't even know what to call myself? I think copywriting would be interesting, as I definitely dabbled in that. I kind of dabbled in everything. Do I need a portfolio? What would be in it?

2. What can I be? I'd hate to become a ""social media"" person. I love being a part of the whole creative process. Involving art direction, copy, events, etc. Is there a junior version of anything like this?

3. I have a year worth of experience of a payed position in a marketing agency. I was hands on and around a lot of meetings, etc. How much will this help me get another job?

I know that's a lot, but thank you so much.

I've noticed as of late that some commercials say outright that their product Brand X is better Brand Y, but for some reason I've always thought mentioning a competing brand by name in an ad wasn't really legal or allowed. I suppose it's because I'm more used to seeing ads that don't directly mention their competition by name but instead beat around the bush by saying something like ""we're better than that *that other brand*"" in a way that leaves little question as to which brand product they're talking about. 

  So I guess I'm wondering what leads some products to mention their competitors by name while others go out of their way to avoid mentioning the competition by name, yet strongly allude to the product.  Are there criteria that allow direct brand mentions in some cases (e.g. if their claim is proven to be true), or do these companies feel it would be beneficial enough in the long run that they're willing to pay the fine that would result in doing so, or is it not a legal matter at all but rather simply frowned upon within the industry?

A little background: I'm a young professional on the publisher side, digital, based in the US. I work closely with marketers and outside agencies to help build and execute their campaigns (mostly banners). 

Overall, I like what I do and feel fortunate to have a good job in a tough economy. But recently, I've been curious about life on the other side, and think it would be cool to help create multi-channel marketing plans, either at an agency as a planner or working directly for a marketer as a brand manager. 

I've been thinking about moving to NYC to pursue this, but am worried about making the leap, specifically due to the competitive nature of these jobs (it seems everyone in this subreddit wants to be a planner...). 

So here is my plan: I think I have a good resume and good experience, but would like to get my individual certification in Google Analytics to help bolster my resume. As a marketer, I feel like this is a requirement. Am I wrong? If so, which software do brand marketers/managers use? Also, as much as I don't want to, I could move home for a few months to save money. When I move to NYC, presumably without a job, I would hit it hard everyday and just look for jobs. 

R/ads: Am I over thinking this, or am I way off? I'm still in my twenties and am in a pretty good spot in my career, and at a company I could stay, presumably, for a long time. Am I dumb for wanting to jump ship?

&gt;Making an ad requires constant trashing and editing. When you're starting out, you really have NO idea what's a ""good idea"" or a ""bad idea."" You really need an experienced person to tell you these things. ""No, that's been done before."" ""No, you're trying too hard."" ""No, I don't get it."" ""No, that's a long way around."" ""No, that's not surprising enough."" ""No, you're not thinking of the business problem.""
That feedback (the instruction) is, in my opinion, extremely valuable and each time you get feedback your brain grows another inch.

I think it would be cool if we put together a list of the questions we ask ourselves while doing creative advertising work. Here are mine with DatLe_ArtDirector's included:

Edit: Updates 8-9-2012

* Has it been done before?
* Are you trying too hard?
* Is it easy to ""get it""?
* Is it the shortest ""route""?
* Does it ""pop"", surprise, or make an impact?
* Does it solve the business problem?
* Does the viewer have something to take away, talk about later, or return to?
* Is it cool or interesting enough to share?
* Is the product synonymous with the activity?
* Is there relationship or identity with product depicted in ad for others to recognize?
* Do ideas match copy (vice versa), are ideas topical, is there reasoning between them?
* Is the ad ambiguous? It shouldn't be!
* Does it work without brand familiarity?
* Does it make people think too much?
* Does it quickly communicate the idea?
* Is it obvious what to do/buy?

Break some things down for me..,thisonesforthebooks,12,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/smyo9/you_arewere_a_copywriting_student_break_some/,"... I was a copywriter at a network agency myself, but I never really had any formal advertising or copywriting education - I just got really lucky.

So besides formatting, what else would one learn on a copywriting track in school?

When I often brainstorm with other ADs and other ad creatives, they would look at my headline/tagline/any line and dissect its meaning word by fucking word and extrapolate on entirely new meanings that each word would contribute to the message. Which WOULD make sense since writing up copy comes getting a limited writing canvas. But when they draw out these other-worldly concepts I'm often thinking to myself, ""Where the heck are you getting this? I came up with it because it's on-brief and it sounds nice.""

Not to try to muscle out a whole curriculum from you guys but I'm trying to get a bearing on what is actually taught so I myself, can stay afloat.

So I'm offering up some rambling advice based on my experience* in interviewing a lot of people. I hope this is helpful and others can add more in the comments.

-

**THE WORK**

What I'm looking to see in your work:

**1** - You can come up with ideas that exist in the intersection between 4 spaces: the brand, the communication task, real-world practicalities and engaging people. With juniors I am much more interested in the first and last things - the middle two are a bonus.

**2** - You can bring these ideas to life, using your craft (art or writing or whatever it is).

**3** - You can sell these ideas to me.

I guess some CDs are only looking for #2 in juniors. For me, that's the least important.

#3 is big. Don't leave me to flip through your portfolio in silence, or present every page with a mumbled ""Um, this was just this thing I did…"".

Work out in advance the best way to sell each piece very quickly. Some work is best presented as ""ta-dah!"", in which case focus on the strategic build-up then reveal the ad. Other work needs to be explained. Make it snappy and fun. Focus on what is great about the work. Do not talk about all the restrictions you were under - that is a truism of every ad ever made. Instead talk about the opportunity. Mention results if you can.

Don't bring too much work. Bring 5-6 ideas and only present enough so I get the idea, get why it's cool, then move on. I don't want to see all twelve print ads in the same layout making the same pun in different ways. The best one is enough.

Invent fake work! If you feel your work does not show ideas as described #1 above, then invent stuff for fake/fantasy clients to show you can do it. How else will I know? Just be honest about what is fake.

If I offer constructive criticism, don't immediately defend yourself. Take the criticism on board graciously, even if you think I'm wrong. Defensiveness is an alarm bell for CDs identifying one of the worst types of creatives.

Don't limit it to print ads and TV/radio scripts. I want to see you understand modern advertising - ideas that go where the audience is and engages them.

Include other things that are not ads but show you understand engagement and/or cutting edge technology. I interviewed a guy (through this subreddit) who was a world-ranked gamer. He wouldn't have told me if I hadn't asked. It should have been in his book! Made a minecraft level that 100,000 people have liked? Run a YouTube channel? Have 500k karma? These are all very relevant and are often representative of the things the senior guys lack that they hope to get from juniors.

Don't be negative - about your work, people, past jobs, other agencies. Again, an alarm bell goes off.

-

**THE PERSON**

I don't care what you wear or look like. I don't care if you're shy or confident. 

I DO care that:

- You are a stable, nice, upbeat person - not a flake, downer or asshat. I gotta work with you every day.
- You listen, think, then speak intelligently. This is a communications business. Shy or quiet is OK, but you must be able to communicate intelligently.
- You are really keen. Show me you've done your homework about me, and my agency. Who's the CEO? What was our last best piece of work? What's the history of the network?

Don't bullshit. Don't present ideas that aren't yours, fake results or lie on your CV. This industry is too small.

Please add more or ask questions...

-

(* I've been in this industry for eons, currently working as an ECD at the global level of an average ad network. I don't have any jobs going, sorry. And yep I know getting the interview in the first place is the toughest part.)

I could go to another college just so I get a useless college diploma but I don't want that.

I was not good at first but I like to believe that I got better. But how do I make a living out of this mind of mine? Writing is not the best way.

Need advise please.,JoshPftw,12,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1i7veu/so_i_want_to_work_in_the_marketingadvertising_of/,"So I've discovered in recent years that I really want to work in advertising.  The company I work at is family owned, so if I want I can pitch an idea all the way up to the top with no problem.  The only issue is that the owner is a penny pinching individual who usually tries to run everything on minimum standards, but expects maximum profit...like all owners, right?

I won't disclose the name of the company, but its a major mattres and bedding retailer, and the ads make me cringe.  I've been working on marketing research on and off for the past several months, but I don't have a formal degree in advertising.  What I have is a degree in Entrepreneurship, and most of the electives I took had to do with marketing.  My research includes marketing to different age generations, and demographics.  The importance of having a good advertising campaign.  And what companies didn't really take off until they sunk some big cash into marketing campaigns.

I feel like the company has a lot of potential, but he barely advertises in two of his major markets, and the quality of the ads sound like every other mattress/bedding retailer.  I know I have what it takes to make us stand out, but I don't want to pitch any ideas if I don't go in armed with the best knowledge/advice.

TL;DR - My goal is to pitch to the owner that I would be a good fit in our marketing/advertising department, but I don't know if I have what it takes to convince him to hire me/expand the budget even though I know he has the money to do so.",,False,self,t5_2qhvy,False,,,True,t3_1i7veu,http://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1i7veu/so_i_want_to_work_in_the_marketingadvertising_of/,

Other Side of Amy’s Baking Company Controversy in Scottsdale To Soon Be Told

SCOTTSDALE, AZ. MAY 15, 2013 -- Amy’s Baking Company will host a Grand Re-Opening on Tuesday night, May 21, following unflattering portrayals on national television.

Customers will be able to decide who is correct: a famous celebrity chef or the marketplace that has supported the small, locally-owned business for six years. 

When re-opened, a portion of proceeds will benefit a charity organized to bring awareness to cyber bullying. 

Seating is limited. Reservations may be made by emailing sjones@rosemoserallynpr.com. 

Diners will also have the opportunity to meet, and judge for themselves the character of owners Amy and Samy Bouzaglo, who have devoted their lives to and earn their living from their small restaurant. The Bouzaglos have been married for 10 years, after Sammy emigrated from Israel. 

The owners will likely be holding a press conference before the Grand Re-Opening and answer falsehoods depicted on a reality television show, including assertions that the restaurant confiscates tips from servers. 

In fact, wait staff is paid $8-$14 per hour, two and half to nearly five times the standard hourly wage for servers. 

Questions will also be answered about what happened to their Facebook page. 

Amy’s Baking Company was recently featured on the hit PBS show “Check Please” and has received A+ reports from CBS 5 for kitchen preparedness. 

“We are very upset by what has taken place, apologize about the acrimony that has ensued but now must fight back to save our business. We hope and believe much good can result from what has transpired. We ask the public to keep an open mind as we begin to tell our side of the story,” Samy Bouzaglo said.

Anyways, what do you think? A huge part of me wants to move to Los Angeles, but everyone keeps saying how awful it is. But I kind of like the idea. I don't know. I know people say it is expensive, but is it really that bad when you have an actual job and aren't trying to ""make it"" or something?

How is the job market for advertising at the moment? I know a lot of people are complaining about not being able to find jobs;however, I am wondering where they are living. Like, good luck in Idaho.

Last time I got great insight into things to correct, change and delete. I've worked really hard revamping things and would love to get feedback. Having moved around a bit recently, I kind of work without any feedback so this helps. I'm aiming for a Junior Copy role.

[Portfolio](http://cargocollective.com/MarioRamirezReyes/)

And I guess one of the questions that I would like answered honestly is: would you hire me for a junior role based on this? 
(I understand opinions vary from person to person, but I would like to gauge where I am at).  

Edit: I just wanted to say thank you very much to everyone who gave me an opinion. Obviously, I'm not closed off to more feedback, I'd actually love it, but I do appreciate a lot of you taking the time out from your busy schedules to look at my work and comment on it. 

Edit 2: I've spent the past day reviewing the pieces, looking over the feedback given in this thread and the previous one and I've come to some conclusions:   

* I've been confusing the forrest for the trees. In cases like the Energy Porn and Fifa (both) they would probably work as *part* of a bigger concept, applications of this, but on their own they lack and even bore. I'll work on bigger ""worlds"" that can work down to applications... kind of like the difference between a conceptual five-course meal vs. cutting a sandwich in five pieces.  
* I need to integrate the design from the get-go. Someone noted it needs work and I believe this came from a convoluted process where design was an afterthought. It takes me longer, but it's the right way.  
* I should start using known brands. This will probably help me create cleaner copy since I will be working with a previously established mythology of sorts (culture, icons, etc). This doesn't mean the cluttered copy is *because* of using unknown brands (that would be a cop-out), but it will be a better exercise at the moment.   
* Proofread, proofread, proofread. Pretty self-explanatory.

I currently work for a major agency on a durables client where I work on the account service side. I enjoy working with clients, helping with strategy and creative direction-- but I miss the creativity of previous roles as a copywriter.

In my current role, I jump at the chance to write copy or do some quick design work, but I'm by no means great at Adobe CS and I don't have a portfolio of my writing. I've been working to write more (volunteering for non-profits, etc.), but I don't know how strong my work really is since I don't have an art director giving me feedback. The fact is though that I'm capable of copywriting (I sometimes fill in if our writers are too busy) but don't necessarily have the confidence/skill built yet.

At the same time, I believe that I'm good at account service and do enjoy it most days. I've been mentored by a few account directors who've been impressed by my work and ability to handle clients. The idea of pitching for new business is really exciting and fascinating to me since I enjoy sales.

I'm currently in Ohio but am moving to NYC in about a week and a half where I'll be job hunting. I'd like to try to figure out my career direction, but I'm torn between my creative mind and experience/skill for account service. 

Is there a role or a type of agency that I should be looking into to satisfy what I need?

TL;DR: Torn between account service and creative. Experience in account service, but more passion toward creative work. Internal debate ensues. OP asks for input.

Thanks everyone!

1. Is advertising a viable career? Is the degree versatile? Is there place for advancement? will it be difficult finding a job?(I'm in CA)?

Any of you majored in advertising but doing something different?

2. What sorts of things do you study in college as an advertising major? What sort of things do you have to do in your classes?

3. What's the difference between a degree in marketing, or a degree in business with an emphasis in marketing and a degree in advertising? Are they paid differently? Do they get different jobs/tasks? Which one is better? Which one is more versatile? I hear marketing is not a great degree and has lots of competition, is this the same for advertising?

4. What's your typical day like and what's your position, what sorts of duties do you carry out? 

5. Do you enjoy your job?

6. how much is your salary?/how much experience do you have /how long have you been working?/What's a starting salary like and what will I be expected to do? As I get more experience what things do I get to do? What's a ""senior"" position?

I've done my research on the major however, I don't know any actual person who does this for a living that I can speak to, so it'd be great if you guys can help. I'm done with all my general classes and I'm currently tied between three majors(business, public relations, and advertising). I'm currently a business major but I'm really liking advertising because I like business, I'm good with people, art, and creativity. 

I'm an ENTP and I love creating ideas and I like business and I know these sorts of jobs are great for my personality, for me it's important that I have a job that I enjoy and one that I'm passionate about, so I've come here to ask these questions.

Some background:  I'm not a marketing/PR/ad guy, and I have some social anxiety problems that get in the way of communication, but I'm always working on independent, small-business projects, so learning to advertise is essential.  Delivering on products is never a problem, but letting people know they exist is a *huge* bottleneck.

Here are some of the issues I'm struggling with during this Kickstarter campaign:

1. How can I translate my own enthusiasm for my product into something that makes others excited as well?
2. How can a maintain a good volume of promotion without coming off as ""pushy""?
3. What tone should an ad take when looking for backers?
4. What's some good reading material for someone interested in studying advertising (or marketing)?

The problem is, I currently have no portfolio to show them. I am currently working on a marketing plan for a local small business, but this text report is all I have so far. So my question is, where can I start to build a portfolio?

I'd really like to get into working creative, but I like the idea of working accounts as well. Should I demonstrate in my portfolio a preference for one or the other? What sort of things can I include? I've seen people doing 'mock' ads for products, is this a good move? Should I do them for the firm I'm applying for?

I’m trying to get to know the industry better, and so far I think I may be interested in copywriting, account management or strategy.

My question is, what are some of the general requirements of the field, or of the individual positions? Basically I can write well, enjoy working with people, have a few years of soulnumbing customer service under my belt, can use photoshop on a beginner level and (almost) have a BA in Media, Culture Technology from a good uni. I have read that many people have more broad experience ranging from DreamWeaver to HTML and advanced photoshop skills.  

Thanks in advance. P.s. I’m based in Sydney although I do want to move to London at some point in the future.

Here's a question for the old-timers: what should you chase early on in your career, in your opinion, to achieve the greatest success later on?


Experience?

Big clients for your cv (or portfolio)?

A good mentor?

A well-respected agency?

Good training/knowledge?

Heck, money (reasoning: greater monetary worth, greater perceived worth)?

Have at it!


I'd also like to use this occasion to thank the community. Not everyone in advertising has regular access to brilliant minds like yours, so to people like me your advice, insights and opinions are invaluable. 


For anyone who's interested, here's why I'm asking. I'm in the enviable position of having a dilemma over which should be my next career move. In my (small) current agency I work with a wonderful group of people, but the work is a bit meh, the client list meagre, the pay miserly and I'm the sole planner (with only a year or so experience in another agency). 

I've been approached to work at a large agency for a huge global account under a planner with 30+ years experience, but I've been told not to expect a wage hike nor the opportunity to work ""by the book"".

I'm getting ready to graduate from Rochester Institute of Technology soon. I was a Game Design and Development student, but decided that it wasn't for me and switched to our Advertising and Public Relations (APR) major. I'm loving the switch and just completed my first full year of classes in the major back in May. I've got roughly a semester and one or two additional classes left and I'll be able to graduate in August.

I'm interested in creative, mostly copywriting since I don't have artistic drawing ability or anything. However, I feel as though my school's program prepares me more for media buying and campaign management in general. From what it seems, the program is mostly trying to get students to dabble in a bit of everything. If it matters at all, I do manage all the social media for the school improv club (mostly Facebook at this point).

Anyway, to the point of this post, I want to develop a good enough book to apply for jobs at agencies and not look like a complete joke. I've got a few creative briefs under my belt from school projects, and some basic ads, but what I'm looking to you guys for is possibly steps or a reference to use in order to start creating ads (again, I'm mostly interested in copy). Something similar to /r/sketchdaily could be all I need, or if you have better ideas, I'd love to try.

I would think that I should start by learning graphic design tools, at least so I can start doing fancy typeface stuff and being able to put logos on a picture without it looking horrible. I appreciate any guidance you can give me.

So I got this summer job at a local museum, and every August (this year the 16, 17, and 18), the town does this big thing called Jamboree Days, we are on the outskirts of town and do our own thing that coincides with that called Harvest Days (we're a hick town, this used to be a tractor club and was converted into a museum).

**For Background:** This museum is a non-profit thing run by old people who used to be farmers and love tractors. There are plenty of buildings on site (old school, church, train station, etc.), and many antiques of all kinds. 

**What I do:** I'm one of their first ever hired employees, brought in for the summer to get things a bit more organized. They don't really have anything written down, so I'm trying to talk to everyone involved to get all the details on everything and make up a booklet so that if something were to happen to anyone, there would be a place for someone to go to see what was done, and how it was done. Part of this job, which my boss asked me to do because I'm ""young and probably more savvy with all this news and computer stuff"" was to advertise for any events, the main one being Harvest Days.

**What I've already done:**

* Contacted the two local news stations about getting on the news to promote it, they have these little segments after the weather where they profile certain people, and also one, longer one, after the weather where local, small-time people can speak about events and things that they're doing (ex. new band playing at a local bar). I've only e-mailed today, and I have 9 weeks, so I figure that's a start at least. 

* Talked to the guy who does our posters, told him what we kind of want. He does this for free and is the president's son though, so it's tough to put in too much of my input because he does things how he thinks. Like he wants everything super modern even though this place has all antiques. But he says that's what attracts younger people, so I guess I can't contradict him if he knows what he's talking about. 

**What more I plan on doing:**

* distrubuting all our posters all over town and to any tourist places in the area
* contacting the local newspapers to place ads, and maybe a story (?)
* There's another town nearby that has a newsletter instead of a paper, so I'm going to place an ad in that. 
* Some how on the internet, I'm not sure how yet. 

**My main questions for you:** 

* Is there anywhere on Reddit where I can advertise for this thing? Like I said, it's a non-profit place run by old people, so if we can bring in lots of people and of all ages, it would really help out a lot.

* Are my ideas so far on the right track? Is there anything more I should be doing, or is there anything I should be doing in a different way?

* What kind of timeline should I be using for this? I have 9 weeks right now, but at what points should I be actually promoting things?

* Are there other ways I could be promoting this event that is low-cost?

* I'm seriously open to any advice you guys have, and would great appreciate anything!

So I'm a year out of college and have been working at a known, global agency on a national account as an AAE for a year. It's an opportunity I know many people looking to break into business would kill for. I am really thankful for the job, but after a year of long hours, just enough pay to scrape by in a city, and doing mostly... paperwork, I'm questioning if this is really the dream job that I had imagined. 

I guess I assumed that even the account side would have a little more creative input, but mostly its just piles of tedious paperwork. However, even the creative team doesn't really seem to have it that great. Get your ideas shot down and then... paperwork. Is this the industry as a whole or is this just common in the big agencies? How about the bad pay and hours (I do about 11 hours a day)? What are realistic expectations?

Does advertising ever become the dream job? You know, the job that people not in the industry think you have? I'm just having second thoughts about the industry as a whole.

Right now, it looks like I'm either going to be going back to agency in a strict accounts role, or stay in the client world, which is an 'all or nothing' risk, depending on whether they want to embrace digital or not (everyone says they do, few actually invest)

I'm doing my best to learn code (not to be a programmer, but to be able to work with devs and know their processes) and I'm taking continuing ed in digital management, but I feel like my momentum with print is taking me further and further away from relevance, and I'm SO passionate about digital.
I'm open to going down to a coordinator tier in a digital agency to add to my skillset, but I'm not sure if the step back is worth it in the long run. Is there anything else I can do to demonstrate interest and understanding?

I need to move. I’d be willing to put up with the perennial late nights, the terrible pay and the lack of job security if it meant learning how to do my job well, but I’m being encouraged to do exactly the opposite.


As the sole planner of the agency (I have around a year’s experience and was promised a mentor, but none seems forthcoming), my job consists of coming up with strategies in little more than a day or two. I call them strategies, but they are anything but – any quantitative and qualitative research I use consists of stuff I can scrounge off the internet; whatever strategic direction I suggest is brought into a group meeting of creative directors, executives, VPs, you name it, to be ignored and replaced by a one-word strategy made up on the fly to justify the consensual creative direction. The latest “strategy” was “we care”. My job has essentially become making the creative executions backwards-compatible with said “strategy”, then sugarcoating the entire thing for client consumption.


I love my job when I’m allowed to do it well, I wouldn’t want to do anything else. Working like this, however, is demeaning and frustrating. I’ve brought the issue up with the head of the agency, who just told me to work “less by the book”.


Rant over. 


I’ve decided I want to move away from Italy (where I am currently) and look for opportunities elsewhere, but I simply can’t afford to move to Australia, Canada, the UK, etc. (I’m pretty open as to where to go) to look for a job – I have to hunt from here. 


Any advice on how to best go about it? Any countries/cities/agencies you think would be forthcoming?


TL;DR: Unhappy where I’m working now, need advice on job search and where to go.

I guess i'm wondering, has anyone ever worked on these types of accounts before even though you were morally opposed to it? How did it turn out for you? What were the benefits and what did you get out of working on this account?

and lastly, how will I be able to turn this experience around and get the most out of this experience? (as you can guess, i've just been placed on one of these accounts, but as a summer intern I dont exactly have the freedom to say I want a different one, especially since I need this experience)

You're right, I'm barking up the wrong tree with print media, and will work more on the online aspect where my prospects are likely to hang out.

There is a local business journal, and it goes out to everybody, but from personal experience (both mine and seeing what happens to it at client locations) it just goes right into the trash without being read. 

Direct mail also sounds like it's worth a try, since there's very little of it, and the number of locations I'd need to hit is relatively small.

Circumstances have changed here with acquisitions and I feel that this is my opportunity to get out of this small town where advertising doesn't ""flourish"". For example, ""Ask the Expert"" is one of the only things that passes for ""creative"" in this market. 

I didn't go to Miami Ad School. I studied advertising and have a passion for it. I adapt very quickly and really want to succeed in this business. I am currently updating my resume to include all of the national agencies (McCann, Horizon, OMD, etc.) that I work with in broadcast television daily, projects I have started/completed, etc. in the past 2 years I have been working in ad sales here. 

I just wanted to get some feedback from people who are either in larger cities (Chicago is my first choice) or have come from smaller DMAs and got into the advertising scene. I have the confidence that I can do anything the big city has to offer and just thinking about the opportunities is putting a smile on my face. 

Let me know your experiences and what you all have been through in order to break into the big city agencies.

Or would it make any sense to split up my buy to place some of it myself and some of it with an agency to see what works best? For what it's worth, I enjoy working with (most) ad reps. I could do a better job with tracking and reporting, but I haven't really been pressed for this-- although that could definitely change.

I'm a creative person, and I don't deal well with people (I'm not really able to sell or persuade people), so it would be good if I could do something creative. I like writing, so something with writing would be good.
