While I hate everything about the outcome of the game...it's worth noting that Cards fans are, by far, the classiest and most knowledgable fans I've ever had the joy of watching a Rangers away game with.  From all the folks pregaming at Paddy O's to the all the people crammed in the MetroLink train afterward...nothing but courtesy and class. 

No matter how this thing shakes out...this has been a helluva series that both of these two fanbases, and baseball as a whole, deserved.  Here's to Game 7.

Now that majority of the October Fans have left, just wanted to reach out, and offer others as well, to say thanks to our Moderators who did a fantastic job this past season. Between keeping the sidebar relatively updated during the season, to playing to our superstitions during the post season, and most of all, helping keep things clean when we had visiting teams to our sub. They have done a great job, and they deserve the recognition. 


Also, I enjoyed the season with all of you, and i'm certainly looking forward to the next.

Its good to see him back.  I remember when he went out that some were saying it could be a career ender with the surgery and all.  He proved em wrong and thats not just good for St Louis, but good for baseball as a whole.

Hes been a Reds-beater since his early days in Houston but Ive always loved the way the big guy plays the game, all out and always having fun.

Anyways, cheers to that and a good 2nd half of the season!

I don’t even know why I am a giants fan. You are clearly the most talented catcher in MLB right now. To watch you in the squat behind the plate is a beautiful sight, and it makes me weak in the knees. Every time a ball slaps your mitt I can only think about how I wish it was my balls in your big masculine hands. 

I can’t even begin to describe how much I love you. I tune into cardinals games on television just so I can get a glimpse of the perfection that you represent. There is no greater thrill than watching you swing the bat, opposing pitchers don’t stand a chance against such a beautiful swing. I wish I could have one night with you to show you that I can handle some wood too. 

How could anyone ever deny your greatness with 2 world series rings, 5 gold gloves, a 4 time all star, and over 1,000 career hits? I’m sure you’re not gay because what woman could resist such a strong and powerful individual, but if you were I would love to take you out on the town and then we could go back to my place where you could have your with me until the sun came up.

Yadi, you are beautiful and I love you!

He led the league in batting average (.376), runs (135), RBIs (131), hits (230), OBP (.450), extra basehits (103), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702).  These were all also personal highs for him.

Notice the conspicuous absence of the homeruns stat.  Well, the new thing I learned has to do with that.  Musial hit 39 bombs in 1948, his personal high.  He actually hit more homers than he had strikeouts--he struck out just 34 times that season.  However, had Musial hit one more homerun to reach 40, he would have hit two milestones:

1) He would be the only player in MLB history to lead his league in batting average, hits, doubles, triples, homers, RBIs, and slugging in one season.

2) He would have won the Triple Crown, becoming one of a very elite group of players to have won the coveted award.

Well, according to Musial, he did hit that homerun.  A few sources credit Musial as recalling a lost homer on August 3rd playing at the Polo Grounds, a game that got rained out and the box score was tossed and never posted.  Since Musial was one of the most honest and straightforward guys to have ever played the game, it's very possible he tagged a homerun in this game, thus giving him claims to a legitimate (although unawarded) Triple Crown award.

Just something I thought was remarkable that I had never actually known until today, and I thought I might as well share it.

RIP, Stan the Man.",,False,self,t5_2r7tu,False,,STL,True,t3_1id999,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cardinals/comments/1id999/til_something_new_about_stan_the_mans_legendary/,

Petition to bring it back.",zaphod_85,79,20,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cardinals/comments/11cgxh/today_the_world_champions_watermark_was_removed/,"~~Yes, I agree that the watermark was often annoying, and made it quite difficult to read things in this sub. Had it been removed before the postseason began, I would have had no complaints. But that was not the case.~~

~~Instead, we waited until today, the day of a potential series-clinching game, to make a large stylistic change to this subreddit.~~

~~Now, I don't know about the rest of you, but when it comes to my Cardinals, I am incredibly superstitious. I feel that this change, in the middle of a postseason series, imparts a great deal of bad mojo to the team that we all love.~~

~~Thus, I would propose a temporary reinstatement of the ""World Champions"" watermark, at very least until the end of this series, preferably until the conclusion of the postseason. Please upvote and message the mods if you agree; I feel that it is imperative that we correct this egregious error before first pitch tomorrow.~~

**Go Cards!!**

~~Edit: We now have only 4 hours until first pitch. As it stands, the voting on this submission is 83% positive. The justification for removing the watermark was that the subreddit overwhelmingly supported such a move; it seems that the opinion has now done a complete 180, and the readers of the subreddit overwhelmingly support reinstating the watermark. Hopefully the mods will choose to listen to the wishes of the readers of this subreddit. Keep upvoting, commenting, and messaging, everybody! There's still time to fix this!~~

**FINAL EDIT:  IT'S BACK!!** Thank you to everyone who helped spread the message, and **especially** thanks to the mods for being so understanding, and for accommodating us with our silly superstitions. I can't express how much I appreciate it. And with that, I will leave you all with one final message;

I have always been interested in baseball, heck I even played some during my teens in my local team here in Sweden. I love the game but I have never gotten into the MLB. I have always rooted for the Blues in NHL, the Rams in NFL and I feel a strong connection to the Cardinals. 


So my question is, what is some of the most important things to know about the Cardinals, where can I purchase some sort of streaming service to start watching the games. What days are usually game days and what time? 


How is the season going? 


Sorry if I ask stupid questions and so on, but I really want to be a dedicated fan of the MLB and of course the Cardinals. 


Thanks for reading!

**UPDATE:**


Just wanted to say thanks for the support in this thread, you guys are awesome, really! I'll be watching some of tonights game, can't watch all of it because of work in the morning. 


And again, THANKS!

Overall, who wouldn't consider this season a success?  I was **psyched** when they announced Matheny as the new manager.  He was, without question, my favorite Cardinal at the time he played, and probably in the top five of my lifetime.  I'm partial to great defensive catchers with a laser arm.  [And super bad-asses who can take a 93mph fastball to the face and not fall down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIQOsJhcr6s).  For a rookie manager, getting your team to the NLCS is fantastic no matter what they did the previous year, and a guy like Mike Matheny - a true student of the game with a ridiculous work ethic - will only get better.

Game Seven was tough, yes.  Ugly.  Hideous.  Not a fun experience for any of us, unless there are Cards haters subscribed to this subreddit.  If so, why?

However meager they may be, there are two silver linings I have drawn from the stormclouds of pain and disappointment.  The first one being that I honestly love seeing a (non-Yankees) home team win a huge game.  The reaction of the crowd and the sheer joy of the players in that first minute or so?  That's what we all hope for every season with any team we root for in any sport.  That initial sixty seconds or so of complete unadulterated **YEAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!**  I believe these few short moments... before the initial shock wears off, and you start talking about it, or even thinking about forming any words other than YES... that's one of those very rare times in life in which a person feels absolute joy and contentment.  Happiness untainted by self-consciousness and doubt.  Those moments don't come along very often.  By the end of this game, I'd almost completely resigned myself to our collective fate, and actually looked forward a bit to the celebration.  I wouldn't be celebrating along with them, but I would be witnessing more than 40,000 people all experiencing that feeling together.  So on two outs, I turned the volume way up and waited for the nail in the coffin.  (And tried not to have overtly murderous thoughts about Tim McCarver.  YOU SUCK TIM.  SERIOUSLY GO AWAY.)  I won't say it put me in a good mood, but it was definitely better than it would've been seeing this game happen in St. Louis, when I would've been sharing in the bitter disappointment of 40,000 fans, and thereby increasing my own.  I can almost imagine how much fun it was for those Giants fans at that game.  I was at a playoff game against the Braves when the Cards trounced them and Mark McGwire hit a pinch-hit home run, and that's still one of my favorite memories.  So much fun.

The second silver lining is just one of those special baseball moments that most of us have once in awhile.  Those things you see in a game that just remind you how special this game is.  The slow-motion shot of [Hunter Pence's broken bat](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1603885/slomowood.gif) was one of those things.  Due to the circumstances, I obviously couldn't appreciate it at the time.  All I could do was curse that stupid bleeping bat and bleeping maple bats in general (seriously WHY DO THESE STILL EXIST?) and Tim McCarver (seriously. I'm sure you're a nice guy and all... but your announcing skills are garbage and I can't understand why you keep getting gigs.) and initially Descalso for looking like an absolute fool.  However, having had several hours to calm myself, and then watch the replay again, I realize that it's simply amazing.  The ball hit the bat **three times**.  It almost sounds physically impossible, and I certainly have never even heard of anything like that, let alone seen it in such crisp, clear, beautiful video as was provided to us all via the awe-inspiring technology of the high-speed camera.  Whoever decided to point those at pitchers and batters, just... thank you for that.  It's another one of those things that reminds me... this game is just... *great*.  It's such a great game, and I just love it.

The past two post-seasons have been two of the greatest in Cardinal history.  I honestly don't believe I will live long enough to see another one like 2011, and while that is a somewhat disappointing thought, I feel very lucky to have witnessed it.  This one obviously doesn't come close to last year, but still.  The last month has been quite a ride, and (at the risk of sounding like a Cubs fan) I have nothing but optimism for next year.

1362146988.0,40,self.Cardinals,19gnlq,Cards top ESPN Future Power Rankings,amadeus219,45,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cardinals/comments/19gnlq/cards_top_espn_future_power_rankings/,"Story is found [HERE] (http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8967507/mlb-future-power-rankings-2013-nos-15-1), but since its Insider access only I've posted the meat and potatoes of it below. 

The Overview:
The Cardinals are sitting in that sweet spot where they have a strong big league club, an elite farm system and plenty of long-term payroll flexibility. This club has a knack for developing excellent role players, such as David Freese, Allen Craig and Matt Carpenter, which allows it to spend for free agents (such as Matt Holliday) when the need arises. -- Buster Olney

The Dilemma:
As Albert Pujols knows, the Cardinals are not afraid to let a superstar walk as a free agent. Adam Wainwright is set to hit the market next winter, and the Cards must decide if they want to sign him to an inflated market deal now or let him test the market. -- Jim Bowden

The System:
The Cardinals have the top farm system in baseball heading into 2013, featuring impact prospects up top, plenty of depth in position players and pitching and enough help close to the majors to push them ahead of the Twins, who have as much depth but most of it further away. -- Keith Law

The next few years are definitely going to be fun...

**GAME NOTES**
#
* This is the 18th year there has been a Division Series. The Cardinals have appeared in 10 of them.

* Washington was 4-3 head to head against St. Louis this season, winning three out of four at Nationals Park before dropping two of three at Busch Stadium in September.

* The Cards hosted the Nats in the next-to-last series of the season and won two out of three at Busch Stadium, winning the opener, 12-2, and the series finale, 10-4. Washington needed extra innings to win the middle game.

* Believe in the hot-team theory in the postseason? The Cards went 12-4 to finish the regular season before winning Friday night's Wild Card playoff at Turner Field. The Nats, by contrast, were 9-10 down the stretch.

* Wainwright was 1-1 with a 7.27 ERA against the Nats in 2012.

* Gonzalez won his only start against the Cardinals this season, pitched a five-hit shutout at Nationals Park on Aug. 31. St. Louis, on the other hand, had the third-best record in the Major Leagues against lefty starters at 31-17.

Thank you all for an awesome, classy series between what I honestly believe to be the two best teams in baseball. You guys (whether in reddit or real life) were nothing but cool that I noticed. I have mad respect for the Cardinals because of the way their organization is run, with the farm system, the front office, the lovable bullpen (holy shit rosenthal can pepper the zone with that fastball) and you have some of the classiest players in the game. Going into the series, I didn't expect anything less than 7 games. I hope to see you next year, and I know that Matheny (an ex-giant!) will lead you to many years of greatness! so hold your head's high St. Louis! And keep being awesome.

In the position I would probably argue that Jay should win it, but I definitely don't see why he shouldn't be a finalist.

Drew Stubbs is a finalist, .982 fielding percentage, 5 errors, 2.05 range factor, compared to a perfect fielding percentage, 0 errors, and a 2.52 factor for Jay. 
The only argument I can see against Jay is the time he missed, but whereas Bourn has somewhere around 340 more innings than Jay, Stubbs only has 110.

More so that it is theoretically a ""coin-flip"" to decide the winner. I would prefer a three-game series to decide it. Let the weekend be for the wildcard, let the division winners get a few extra days to rest. I'd think they deserve it. 

Without diving into that,, I'll just say that I'd like to apologize for how the fans in Atlanta acted in the 8th inning. That was TOTALLY uncalled for. I was watching from tv, and yes I was upset with the call, but became more embarrassed at what unfolded. It shouldn't have gone down like that. Could say alcohol had an influence, but I don't want to search for excuses. 

Secondly, we could debate if it was infield fly or not. And who knows what would have happened if they didn't rule it the way they did. But, the fact is, it wasn't the play that hurt the Braves. It was the 3 errors by Chipper, Simmons, and Uggla that hurt. It was the runners left on 2nd and 3rd in the 7th and 9th, and the bases loaded in the 8th that hurt. 

Regardless, this game will be labeled with that infleld fly call. And will define the Wild Card game, until something more monumental happens.

I'm sad to see the Braves season over, and Chipper walk off into the sunset. It's not the way you'd want to see a guy of his caliber go out. I think the only way it would have been proper if he went out on top. We're not entitled to the storybook endings though, are we?

Anyways, without rambling more, I want to congratulate the Cards for winning a game by any means possible. Good luck against the Nats, and in the rest of the playoffs. I do have one request though....

Can you guys seriously stop knocking us out? 2 years in a row now. Try it next year, and I can bet we'll come out on top. 3rd time's a charm! ",,False,self,t5_2r7tu,False,,ATL,True,t3_110xt1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cardinals/comments/110xt1/from_a_braves_fan_i_first_want_to_apologize_and/,

Statistics aside, he really appears to buckle down and makes great situational pitches during dangerous innings, and he hustles like mad to first base when he needs to (on offense and defense).

-------------

No essay.

Nolasco performed well against us last year. The K doesn't need defense.

The Marlins generated momentum in winning Friday, which we all know as powerful in baseball. We also all know that most teams, and especially bad teams, play harder against the Cardinals than any other team, because it's *that big of a deal* to win against them.
 
I considered this possible Friday, probable yesterday, and absolute today. Mo and Matheny instructed the players that this series was not important, and that they were to use it as a breather. Should the players give their best effort against a team around a month away from being mathematically eliminated, when we still have **50** games left against the Central, each one being a game we *actually* have to win? 

What cemented my considerations? Were there any shred, any *modicum* of importance attached to this game, Yadi would have started. If Yadi doesn't start, the game doesn't need to be won. It's as simple as that. 

Also relevant: Of all the teams in the NHL last year, the team that finally ended the Blackhawks' win streak was the Avalanche. You know how the Avalanche ended their season?

To my dismay, I knew of no such drinking game. So I thought of one:

Before the game: Take a drink for however many games the Cubs are back. If, by some miracle, the Cubs are ahead of the Cardinals, take a shot for every game they are up.

Take one drink when: the Cardinals get a non-RBI hit, the end of every half-inning, every time a Cub gets out.

Take two drinks when: any player strikes out, a commentator says something stupid

Take five drinks when: a run is scored, a web gem happens (open interpretation).

Finish your drink: a home run is hit, we reach the most serious of numbers (6)

Take a shot: each inning the Cubs are in the lead.

Any other rule ideas? (I know I will be wasted from the 17th to the 20th)",,False,self,t5_2r7tu,False,,cardinals6,True,t3_1g36ee,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cardinals/comments/1g36ee/cardinalscubs_drinking_game/,

http://www.reddit.com/r/Cardinals/comments/12ewvy/official_rcardinals_offseason_rules_thread/

Based on this thread, and a discussion amongst the mods, we have decided on three basic new rules.

1. Image Macros have been banned as posts of their own.  An image macro is any basic picture with text added on the picture, such as [this](http://i.qkme.me/3piyl7.jpg).  You may still post image macros in comments.

2. Memes have been banned as posts of their own.  Memes are anything that can be found in /r/adviceanimals or whatever stupid internet fad is going on at the time.  Memes can still be posted as comments.  **SIDE NOTE**: If an actual Cardinal player is involved in a meme (maybe a video of the Cardinals doing a Harlem Shake), then it is fine to post, since it is actually relevant to the Cardinals.

3. Low quality content have been banned as posts of their own.  Low quality content is very well defined by the mods of /r/NFL [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/qm0hx/new_guidelines_for_rnfl_please_read/).  A good example of low quality content can be found on the front page right now, a picture of Colby Rasmus with the title: ""So glad we got rid of this fucker"".  This contributes nothing to the subreddit and is also in bad taste.  Low quality content is still allowed in the comments.

There will be a link to this post in the Sidebar, as well as in the Sticky at the top on the front page.  If anyone has any questions, the mods will be happy to answer.

Last but not least, happy Spring Training everyone!  Baseball is finally back!

Also I want to mention YOU. Yes the subscribers. I like the topics we have here. I like that our sub isn't watered down with crap like a ton of meme's and just obvious karma whoring.

As of right now, Cliff Lee, Jake Peavy, Jesse Crain, and other trade targets the Cardinals have looked at are still out there amongst talks.

Cliff Lee is definitely on the block but he's going to have a steep price (top 3-4 prospects plus the remainder of his salary, apparently).  I don't see us pulling the trigger on that.

Rzep is listed as a likely trade candidate, which makes sense since a few teams are looking for a lefty reliever and we have three decent or better ones.

Here is the abbreviated version pertaining to the Cards.,Timofeo,23,1,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cardinals/comments/153k02/most_and_least_favorite_team_results_are_in_here/,"There is a lot of really interesting information in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/151xop/most_and_least_favorite_teams_survey_results/) in /r/baseball  by [thedeejus](http://www.reddit.com/user/thedeejus). I read through a lot of it but I just want to make a shorter version for those of you interested in how the Cardinals fared in the poll. For those unaware, 2,606 surveys were completed in which each person chose one favorite team they ""love,"" and assign a value 1-4 to each other team. 1 is ""hate,"" 2 is ""dislike,"" 3 is ""indifferent,"" and 4 is ""like.""

**The Cards finished 4th in the ""most hated"" list with an average rating of 2.33. This was behind the Yankees (1.42), Red Sox (1.96), and Phillies (2.20).**

What interests me most is the ""rating"" given to the Cardinals by fans of each individual team. In the original post, OP made a giant table filled with the average rating given by each team's fanbase to each of the 30 teams. If you don't want to read the entire table, I made a [simple image](http://imgur.com/lanfO) of the average rating of the Cardinals given by fans of each team. In parenthesis below is the rating given between 1-4.

*The Cardinals are most liked by* 

**White Sox fans (2.86)**

**Yankees fans (2.81)**

**Dbacks fans (2.77)**

**Marlins fans (2.75)**

**Blue Jays fans (2.74).**

*St. Louis is most hated by:*

**Reds fans (1.42)**

**Brewers fans (1.54)**

**Cubs fans (1.62)**

**Rangers fans (1.83)**

**Royals fans (2.03).**

Additionally, here is an idea of what Cards fans think of other teams:

*Cardinals fans hate most:*

**Yankees (1.61)**

**Cubs (1.66)**

**Reds (1.71)**

**Red Sox (2.06)**

**Phillies (2.13)**

*Cardinals fans like the most:*

**A's (3.65)**

**Orioles (3.5)**

**Rays (3.47)**

**Blue Jays (3.34)**

**Twins (3.14)**


Surprisingly, it would appear that those of /r/Cardinals  hate the Yankees and Red Sox as much as our divisional rivals. Likewise, we seem to like scrappy American league teams that have overcome a lot.
