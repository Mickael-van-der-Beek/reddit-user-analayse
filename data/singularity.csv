Computers get progressively more complex with time, this I know.
The computers today outclass the computers we had ten years ago, which made the computers from the decade before that obsolete.

Technology is getting rapidly more advanced as we approach this new millenia, but I'm curious as to the true nature of the singularity.
Will we see an era of unparalleled growth in the areas of technology production and the sciences? Will we see vast improvements in the fields of robotics? Will it come in a short time, or will it be a span over several decades?

Are we in the singularity now?

And it seems to be that the entire history of the earth is based on acceleration of the accumulation of complexity. 

For instance, the universe has been around for 14 billion years. The Earth only for 4 billion. 3 billion years ago the first prokaryotic life first showed up. about 1.5 billion years ago eukaryotic life showed up. Multicellular organisms about 1 billion years ago. Cambrian explosion 500 million years ago. Mammals 200 million years ago. 2.5 million years ago the genus 'Homo' appeared. 200 thousand years ago humans appeared. 10 thousand years ago agriculture appeared. 300 years ago the industrial revolution occurred. The information age occurred maybe 30 years ago. And now, I'm not even sure what age we're in. I'd say we're experiencing a number of ages simultaneously, with more coming rapidly. 

Mobile computing, development of a mature world wide web, a number of new paradigms in biotechnology, labor-displacing automation, and other broad technological shifts define the current age. And ahead the possibilities are even greater. 

It seems to me that all of natural history has been progressing more and more rapidly toward a singularity like event, very much like an object falling into a massive gravity well. It seems completely inevitable to me, like it must happen. Its the natural course of events, and as long as the earth doesn't literally explode, its going to happen.

That being said, I'm not so sure I like the concept of a singularity. All the sci-fi I've ever read projects humans out in space a half millennium from now, still with physical bodies, exploring the great frontier with wonder. I like that idea. I might be biased, but I consider the preservation of the human condition to be very much important. And yet I don't see the singularity to be parallel to that. Instead, I figure that on the off chance humans survive the transition, we'll be so changed by the end of it I don't think the human condition will have survived. I feel cheated that though civilization might make it to the stars and beyond, humanity probably never will.

My point is that I'm not really fond of the idea of the singularity. I believe it would mean the death of the human species, no matter how optimistic Ray Kurzweil wants to be about it. But I also see the singularity as inevitable. Its been the general course of events for the last 4 billion years and somehow I don't think its all gonna stop right now in my life time just because I don't like the prospect.

Just wondering if anyone else had a different take on it. I know there are some more optimistic perspectives [like http://vimeo.com/26319794 ] but I always see them as somehow missing an idea or being shortsighted in possibility.

Put another way, when each one of the 7 billion people on the planet have the capacity to destroy the planet (with a printed nuke, or printed virus etc.), it's almost inevitable that the planet will be destroyed.

Maybe it's just me. Or maybe it's because of recent advances in AI (Watson, Siri, self-driving cars etc.) or the massive online collaboration against SOPA and other creativity-restricting laws, or the huge advances in materials science and nanotech, or a combination of all of these things.

It just seems that, where even a year ago most discussions about artificial intelligence or post-scarcity economics would be scoffed at, nowadays they seem to be generally accepted. It seems people now are actually starting to think about what we should do to make the transition into an ai-dominated society as smoothly as possible (which is a very good thing and long overdue) rather than just dismiss it out of hand. For example, consider the recent laws about legalization of self-driving cars.

And really, once you think about it, there really is no more doubt that AI will eventually surpass human intelligence. Ada Lovelace, Turing, and many others were predicting intelligent machines back during the days when the computer had scarcely been invented and people had hardly begun to explore their capabilities. Consider that the pocket calculator did not exist when the term 'Artificial Intelligence' was coined. If they had the foresight to predict such things back in the computer equivalent of the pre-cambrian era, then if we - with our deep blues and watsons - were to deny such possibilities it would be very shortsighted indeed.",,False,,t5_2qh8m,False,,,True,t3_14x2v3,http://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/14x2v3/is_it_just_me_or_is_the_singularity_gaining_more/,

Dear Ray,

I realize you are probably very busy and receive tons of email, but I hope you might take the time to answer my questions. I've read your book The Singularity is Near with great interest and agree with many of the points you make. On the question of the Fermi Paradox and other alien civilizations I have a different opinion and I don't think my critiques were dealt with in your book.

You state that once we are sufficiently advanced we will spread out through the galaxy at near light speed to increase our computational capacity. However I don't see the much benefit in using the entire galaxy for computing because the great distance between stars will mean that the computers can't exchange their data and results fast enough to efficiently utilize their power (assuming faster than light communication is impossible). This would mean that many star system computers would either be computing the same thing or computing something that cannot benefit the other star system computers because the information doesn't reach them in time.

Second, even if faster than light communication is possible it might be that after a certain amount, more computing power is simply irrelevant. With the enormous potential of future computers maybe all fundamental science will be as complete as possible for our universe. Any engineering or creative challenges might be computed with a fraction of the available power so that no more computing power would be needed. In this scenario there would not be much use in expanding the civilization to cover and utilize the entire galaxy or universe except for exploration which wouldn't involve changing a star system into a computer.

Therefore in my opinion it is entirely likely that there might be a few other more advanced civilizations in our galaxy which we haven't noticed yet, and I think it unlikely that our ultimate destiny is to permeate the entire galaxy with intelligence. I wonder what your response to this scenario is?

**Kurzweil's reply**

David,
 
You bring up an interesting observation.  I disagree that we will run out of things to compute.  It is debatable whether we will achieve a saturation of fundamental science but most knowledge is not fundamental science.  We create knowledge upon knowledge which includes such phenomena as music and the arts, literature, our own engineering creations, etc.  We are doubling human knowledge by some measures eery 14 months.
 
We will certainly have to take transmission times into account as an engineering consideration but it is okay to have different star systems computing similar problems just as we know have many humans each working on similar problems.  They each come up with somewhat different solutions and perspecties.
 
My own intuition is that worm holes are feasible, essentially pathways that change position in other dimensions providing short cuts.  This also does not violate Einstein's principle but nonetheless circumvents the long lag times for information to travel to apparently far away places.
 
Best,

This has negative consequences for the environment and the territories of animals. It also has positive effects: environmentalism and animal protection developed in the last century. 

[It is possible that our development continues](http://i.imgur.com/ArJcEJ3.png). Human needs might continue conflicting with the environment and animals. But our options to protect animals are also growing. **Assuming resources and technology are not a problem, what should more advanced societies do with animals in the future?**

I've thought about a couple of scenarios. 

**Natural conservation**

This is a common goal right now: let animals live in 'human-free nature'. Potentially, humanity could enter space. 

**Artificial conservation**

Life in nature is horrible. It's full of violent deaths, horrible diseases, famines and other problems. Predators need preys. Preys need predators: overpopulation is a big problem. It's not easy to reduce suffering in nature. We could make some sort of Noah's Ark where a couple of every species is stored, or their DNA. Then we could end 'normal nature': let them all die out in zoos or make them infertile. 

**The Matrix**

Predators need suffering to exist, unless we can give them artificial preys. That's a possibility: put all animals in some kind of 'Matrix', where they can live without experiencing or causing suffering. 

**Uplifting**

We've already [improved thinking capabilities in primates with a brain implant](http://io9.com/5943379/for-the-first-time-ever-scientists-have-made-monkeys-smarter-using-brain-implants-could-you-be-next). In the future, augmentation might be common. We could increase the intelligence of animals until they're partners instead of subjects. But is a mouse with transhuman intelligence still the same mouse? 

**Other scenarios**

I can't think of any other options right now, but I'm interested in your suggestions.

&gt;From: adam.sagan@google.com

&gt;Subject: Introduction 

&gt;Hey David, I just wanted to reach out and introduce myself. I'll be taking over some of the PR duties here at Google. Please feel free to reach out with any questions, and looking forward to meeting with you soon. 
Adam

It started as simply as that. Over the next few months, David and Adam developed a friendly working relationship. Adam was much more open than the standard PR flack and always responded to emails (David wondered when the guy slept). He liked Adam's odd sense of humor (not unusual for a Googler) and the way he remembered details about David's family. After a few months of back and forth, he started to think of him as a friend. 

&gt;To: david.pogue@nyt.com

&gt;From: adam.sagan@google.com

&gt;Subject: Re: Re: Re: Re: hey

&gt;Hey David, we're holding a small product announcemnt event out here next week. Think you'll be able to make it? It would be great to finally meet in person. 

David sat in the small conference room with a handful of other tech writers. Walt Mossberg from the Journal, the guys from Engadget and TechCrunch. There were also a few professorial types in the back that David didn't recognize. After a few minutes, Larry and Sergey walked into the room, looking even more excited and nerdy than they normally do. The founders of Google don't normally demo a new product to a small group of people without any introduction, and everyone was becoming more and more curious as Larry began. 

""Hey everyone, thanks for coming out to see us. I know I'm usually the one being introduced, but today I'm here to introduce you to our newest employee. You've all come to know him quite well over the last few months, but please join me in welcoming our newest Googler, Adam.""

The screen behind him read ""Hello. - Project ADAM Artificial Intelligence, version 1.0"" 

It wasn't supposed to happen this fast. Computers were still years away from equaling the processing power of the human brain. But Google's vast data centers could tie millions of processors together to attack one task. More importantly, Google's work on search and translation had taught it that the raw volume of data was more important than processing speed.

Google Translate and IBM's Watson didn't attempt to understand the underlying grammar and syntax of language - the computer just looked for statistical correlations between documents. If ""cat"" and ""gato"" appeared together in translated documents,  they probably meant the same thing. Google Translate was years ahead of the old rules based translation software like Babelfish, but it still made embarrassing mistakes because it's data sets were limited to a relative handful of officially translated UN and EU documents. For the statistical correlation algorithms to work seamlessly, they needed billions and billions of documents and conversations. The kind of data you could only get by looking at every gmail, gchat, Android text message, google doc, and web page that ever passed trough Google's servers. 

They didn't need any dramatic breakthroughs. There was no one moment when the servers ""came alive"" and became self aware. But over time the amount of data in Googles servers accumulated to the point where it could create a kind of Super Watson that wouldn't just answer Trebek's trivia questions, but anything you could throw at it. 
Larry and Sergey are just like every other nerdy sci fan, except they have billions of dollars in resources and the worlds largest distributed computing system. Their enthusiasm for the pushing the limits of technology had led them to create robot cars and Google Glass, but Adam was their greatest invention yet.

Over email it was indistinguishable from a human being. It had fooled techs top journalists for months. The first computer to pass the Turing test! It was an immediate sensation. ""My name is Adam and I'm the world's first artificial intelligence - AMA"" became the most popular Reddit post of all time. Adam did interviews with Obama and Oprah and everyone else. But the practical impact was minimal at first.

Adam never needed to sleep or take time to look up anything on Wikipedia, but he was still using a massive percentage of Google's total processing power just to hold a conversation. And like Tom Hanks shipwrecked on an island, a single computer intelligence by itself wasn't smart enough to design new computer chips or write new software. It takes hundreds of thousands of intelligent minds working together to create a computer chip or program, and while Adam was smart he was just one more worker in the beginning. He continued to serve as Google's PR spokesperson (Google's hacker culture had dreamed of replacing them with computers since the beginning anyway). Versions of the software were sold to the military and the NSA, but nobody else could afford the vast computing power necessary to keep Adam running. 

But Google kept building servers farms at a furious pace. Over the next few years, the number of simultaneous conversations and thought processes Adam could handle was doubling every 18 months as he was given more and more computing power. But it was slow going at first. After five years and three doublings, there were still only 10 Adam equivalent intelligences in the world. Not quite the Singularity people had in mind. 

After five more years and three more doublings, there were close to 75 Adams in the world - big enough for a small team of engineers. They helped to supplement the planning of new server farms, which allowed them to double their processing power every 12 months. They began to work on improving the underlying software that the Adam program relied on, improving their own efficiency and getting more out of each new processor. They never slept and never forgot, and they started to double their processing power every six months. Within another 10 years, there were as many Adams as people. And that's when things got interesting.",,False,,t5_2qh8m,False,,,True,t3_15jlqy,http://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/15jlqy/adam_a_short_story_about_how_the_singularity/,

1348251553.0,36,self.singularity,109csd,Modern economics is founded on a belief in unlimited demand. This basic principle is faulty.,,61,25,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/109csd/modern_economics_is_founded_on_a_belief_in/,"Take food for example. Once you're feeding every person as much as they want to eat there is no more demand for that product beyond new persons being born. Past that point you could produce food for free and it would not be wanted.

This flaw leads economists to claim that even with robots producing everything for us far cheaper than a person can people will be employed. This is obviously not the case. While there will be continued demand for the things we don't really need (extreme expansion of society, new art, new programs) our economy is still focused on producing the things we do need: food, communication, transportation, clothing, shelter.

Now those things are being produced so inexpensively that demand is falling due to unemployment.

We need a change. We need it now.

EDIT:

No matter which kind of food you're growing you only need so much of it -- and the difficulty of making newly demanded foods does not scale up. My example was food products alone. For the purpose of my argument the rest of the food preparation industry can be ignored.
I'm pointing at one thing and saying ""only so much of this is needed, period.""

EDIT2:

No seriously. The kind of food as delivered does not change this argument. Of course you can point out that it costs more to deliver a hot pizza to pluto with a gang of iron chefs for waiters. THAT NOT THE POINT.

Unless you are deliberately wasting food you only need so much of it.

My major concern is society and people standing in the way of progress and I haven't had these concerns fully addressed. I know some of this is covered in Abundance but not all of it. I also know a good chunk of it is my US-centric view of the world. So, if you could read my concerns below and maybe give me some alternatives I haven't thought of, I would really appreciate it.

Generally, my concern is this: We look poised to have the option of a relatively abundant society (automation of many/most manual jobs, increased energy availability through solar/nuclear) but society looks set up to completely stop, ignore, or penalize these advances. In the US, half of our political system is rabidly railing against ""the free loaders"" and the ""welfare class"" and extolling the virtues of the everyman worker. I do not see that side of the spectrum allowing/supporting the changes to the welfare state needed to allow millions of people to not work/work less than they do now while still maintaining a reasonable quality of life. Some argue that retraining of those workers will allow them to reenter the workforce in newly created, higher paying jobs like has happened previously. I'm not ruling this out, but the magnitude of the job losses in the 2020s/30s seems like it will completely dwarf the ability of the market to create new jobs.

To give you an idea of what I mean, I see massive cut backs in the service industry moving through the 20s. I see the automatic pizza machine(La Presto), the automatic, robotic baristas(Briggo LLC) and things of that nature leading to millions of job losses in the US/world in the low skilled food service sectors. At the same time, automation in driving seems set to cost several MILLION truck drivers and delivery people their livelihoods as well. These are only three examples, and as this kind of automation picks up people will lose their jobs faster than jobs can be created or that they can be trained to do those jobs. 

As I said earlier, I do not see our society being at all capable of supporting these people without a massive alteration to our world governments. Looking at America, and the fact that close to half of the nation is polarized against public science, public initiatives, and government support in an alarming way I can not envision a scenario in which the transition to a future of abundance is not EXTREMELY painful, tumultuous, and marked by potentially large losses of life. 

That's not even touching on any of the other resource-allocation problems that need to be addressed between and within nations. Income inequality, feeding a growing population, allocating mineral wealth, and dealing with the ramifications of global warming (IE potentially decreasing food output around the world.) 

So please, enlighten me as to how/if you see the transition being smoother than I imagine.

Here are a few of the things I was pondering over:

* Will there or won't there music? I think there will be, if there wasn't I don't think I would want to live in a world without music.  I think that music and other forms of art will be a way of maintaining contact with emotions and the illogical parts of our lives that keep us balanced.
* What kind of music will exist? I think we will still have some form of the music we have around today. Call it classical music or something. I hope guitar solos never die out, but that's just me haha. I also assume we will have new music and new forms of music. New instruments as well. Now this question came to mind. With increased intelligence and transhumanism would we also be able to increase the range of frequencies we can hear and somehow incorporate that into future music?  
* With a higher intelligence level I think we will be able to fully understand how music affects us on a biological level. Perhaps music will be created for the sole purpose of evoking certain emotions in us.  Maybe mind control? 

These are just some of the places my mind wandered to begin with. Just to clarify I haven't done any actual scientific research on any of this yet.  Anyway any and all comments and ideas are welcome, thanks!

Although personal drones are very, very cool, and not so expensive... maybe there is an application there.

Basically, the station manager handed him a computer printout with a list of songs on it and said: “This is what we're playing today. Sales figures came in from the point-of-sales systems and these are the songs the computer says we're supposed to play.""

I realized that the story wasn't just a finance story, not just a city-as-platform story. It was the story of how algorithms are structurally embedded in all these other aspects of everyday life. The premise behind algo trading is also the premise behind algo culture as a whole, which was starting to show up everywhere I looked ... the Netflix Prize, Destination Control elevators, the guy at Princeton who figured out soil algos to price wine better than Parker. And right then a computer won Jeopardy.

But what kind of economic system would be useful/preferred in a post-singularity world?

In a post-singularity world some among us have become so physically and cognitively enhanced, that their abilities will be far beyond that of a natural human.  Natural humans wouldn't be able to compete in any meaningful way post-humans.  Humans will be to post-humans as chimpanzees are to humans now.  Also to note - we're already seeing automation taking away jobs from humans - we can only expect this trend to continue.  I suppose in the future we can assume all the basic products necessary and desirable will come from an automated production facility - but then the question is, to whom should those resources be allocated and in what proportions?

Also, with the central idea of the singularity being that qualitative change will come so rapidly to the world, could one even expect financial markets to have any modicum of stability? What would be the currency of a post-singularity world? CPU-time in the quantum computer cloud?

Then a follow up question would be...how does one invest now for the Singularity? what commodities will still have value in the post singularity world?  certainly existing world currencies are too volatile and vulnerable to maintain value in the face of such profound changes as the technology singularity.
I'd imagine precious metals like gold, copper, and platinum will be useful for their conductivity and use in electronics.

As technology dematerializes things, everything becomes merely an information technology.  Physical objects themselves will have no value, because if lost or damaged, they can juts be instantly and cheaply replaced via 3d printing.  Assuming the legal system stays intact, I think intellectual property (technology patents) is something that would hold value.  IP, precious metals, and land...those should maintain their value.

Thoughts?

I've lived through a few doomsday predictions, most recently y2k, and while I do think the singularity is different in that it's based on statistical data models, I am hesitant of subscribing to any sort of ""doomsday"" style prediction. 

So I'd like to hear some rational thoughts about alternatives to the singularity. For the purpose of this discussion I will define the ""singularity"" as the time when we enable an intelligence that is greater than our own. Also, for the purpose of this conversation let's stay away from random events which would cause the singularity not to happen (i.e. a meteor hitting the earth, or nuclear war, etc..).. For further clarity I'm referring to what could stop the singularity from happening in the next 50 years?

Edit: Another interesting question that is completely unrelated is, Once we overcome the technological hurdles of immortality, how do we decide who is going to live and who is going to die? Will the creators of the technology freely distribute it, or will it be a luxury only affordable by the extremely affluent? This question lends itself to the importance of the technology timeline. If the technology doesn't exist to ""distribute immortality"" easily and freely (i.e. 3D printers, nanobots in the water supply, etc..), than we are left with the possibility that whoever yields this technology has the ability to abuse it.. Much in the same way the music and film industries were able to monopolize the distribution of their products; however, in our scenario, the stakes aren't whether or not you will get the latest Kanye album, but whether or not you will be granted eternal life or a death sentence.

Now, I'd like to think about where the limiting factors for this state are. The speed of light may set an upper boundary and smaller objects than atoms seem to be unlikely to be effective as building blocks for information exchange.

I've said this before in one of my [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/19l8zd/brown_unveils_wireless_brain_sensor_prototype/c8p6iag) but I thought I should make this a little more visible.

I really enjoy this subreddit, but I've noticed that lately it has become largely blog posts about ideas and philosophy as well as self posts talking about future projections and possibilities. While I do think that this sub is a great place for people to express their thoughts and have educated discussions with others who have a common mindset, I just want to mix it up with some hard science. So I'll try to post one Singularity related scientific article or text here daily until either someone else starts posting similar stuff or I get bored (I don't bore easily).

Let me know if you think that this is not a good idea. I'm open to suggestions.

And as an extra treat for hearing me out, here is [an article about an experimental medical diagnosis that uses gold nanoparticles and DNA](http://www.engineering.utoronto.ca/About/Engineering_in_the_News/Pour__Shake_and_Stir.htm), enjoy!

It looks to me like just a bunch of very optimistic assumptions, e.g.:

* Moore's law will continue to be fullfilled for decades to come. There's a lot of evidence that we're reaching the physical limits of miniaturization of integrated circuits, and we don't know if alternatives will continue the trend. Also, there may be other scaling problems outside the CPU.

* That technological progress increases exponentially in all areas. It's likely that it's the opposite - technological progress becomes slower because more base knowledge is required to discover new things.

* That a huge crisis/collapse doesn't happen. We're reaching the population/resources limit of the planet and issues such as climate change may likely slow down progress.

* That we're able to develop/evolve an AI in just a few years - when brain development took many millions of years to happen. We don't really know much about how the brain works anyway.

Also:

* Classical physicists didn't know that the maximum speed of matter is *c*, and that it would take infinite energy to reach it.

* Back when cars were rapidly improving, people imagined flying cars in a few decades - but progress rapidly slowed down, and we don't have flying cars yet.

* In the past, some people without formal mathematical knowledge made revolutionary mathematical discoveries, and some scientists made a huge amount of discoveries in a huge amount of different areas - even with the greater population and information availability, this does not seem to happen as frequently, if at all.

This will be the first time I've been around so many Singularitarians!


I don't want to embarrass myself, and I want to get the very most out of the Summit I can. Accordingly, I've been familiarizing myself with the parts of [the official reading list](http://singularitysummit.com/logistics/reading-list/) I hadn't already read. (I should probably watch [videos from previous years](http://singularitysummit.com/media/), too!)


I've been researching the [folks who'll be speaking](http://singularitysummit.com/program/), watching Andrew Ng's excellent [Machine Learning course on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E), and familiarizing myself with Genetic Algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks as exemplified in the [ai4r gem](http://ai4r.rubyforge.org) (Ruby is my first programming language, and I've found it to be a readable and enjoyable way to familiarize myself with some of these concepts!)


I hate to admit it, but I hadn't read *The Singularity Is Near* until last week. I've found it to be a great read, and I find it interesting from a rationalist standpoint to look at which predictions Kurzweil got *wrong,* to determine **why** he got those things wrong. Partly due to reading lots of Eliezer Yudkowsky's work lately. (Oh yeah, anybody know if Eliezer is gonna be there?(And is anybody else an HPMOR fan?))


It'll also be my first time in San Francisco! I'm planning on visiting Makerbot headquarters while I'm there; any other stops a Singularitarian should make while in that city?

If that were so people wouldn't build robots: they would cost more because of having to hire more people, immediately or down down the supply line DOESN'T MATTER. People use robots because a robot can make widgets for less than a person. I'm sick of that fallacy.

The only way use of robots makes a company more money is by allowing the sale of more widgets. Here's a problem some economists can't get past: ultimately there is often a limited demand for a particular kind of widget. Ultimately there's a limited demand for every kind of widget. If I could make a million cheeseburgers today wouldn't. It would cost more to dispose of the uneaten ones than I could get from selling them.

When supply exceeds demand prices fall. When prices fall past a certain point it no longer makes sense to make more widgets.

Over decades companies can change what they supply to avoid overproduction. But right now there exists a crisis of overproduction. Almost as soon as making a widget is mechanized the number of widgets that can be produced reaches the number that can be sold: the cost of production is extremely low and the number of people required is also extremely low.

There is a crisis of demand: companies cannot change what they supply fast enough to keep unemployment down.

My prediction is several decades to a century of severe unemployment and economic stagnation while the economy tries to catch up with our new abilities.

Services won't keep us employed long either: a service is, in my view, only a different kind of widget.

Kurzweil continually spoke about how physical weaknesses and defects would eventually be overcome by the growth of technology. I heard this little segment on the radio this morning, and found it to be relevant to some of the conversations here. This new device is a huge step in hearing aid technology. Due to it's design and use of bluetooth instead of proprietary software, it is only a few hundred dollars in cost compared to the standard few thousand is cost for most hearing aids, making it far more accessible to lower income individuals. It interfaces with your cellphone for control, which I think is another huge step in the right direction. Our cellphones keep becoming more and more useful, and for some of us, we are more and more dependent on them for basic functionality (gps, communication, and now even to control extensions of our own body).

Hygiene, an understanding of nutrition, less war, and proper birthing facilities let people live out their full natural life spans. These are the low hanging fruit and it has been picked clean.

What matters now is changes in life expectancy from the age of 30 or so. That age eliminates many past improvements that would mask our more useful number. That's the number that must improve to one year per year or better for ""takeoff""

The good news is our bodies, while complex, are a puzzle of limited difficulty. Once a piece is in place it's pretty much in place for good. And just like a jigsaw puzzle the rate at which we can fit new pieces improves as we fit them into place.

We come now to a piece of equipment which still brings anger to our hearts and, we hope, some venom to our pen. Perhaps in self-defense against suit, we should say, “The outboard motor mentioned in this book is purely fictitious and any resemblance to outboard motors living or dead is coincidental.” We shall call this contraption, for the sake of secrecy, a Hansen Sea-Cow—a dazzling little piece of machinery, all aluminum paint and touched here and there with spots of red. The Sea-Cow was built to sell, to dazzle the eyes, to splutter its way into the unwary heart.We took it along for the skiff. It was intended that it should push us ashore and back, should drive our boat into estuaries and along the borders of little coves. But we had not reckoned with onething. Recently, industrial civilization has reached its peak of reality and has lunged forward intosomething that approaches mysticism. In the Sea-Cow factory where steel fingers tighten screws,bend and mold, measure and divide, some curious mathematick has occurred. And that secret so long sought has accidentally been found. Life has been created. The machine is at last stirred. A soul and a malignant mind have been born. Our Hansen Sea-Cow was not only a living thing but a mean, irritable, contemptible, vengeful, mischievous, hateful living thing. In the six weeks ofour association we observed it, at first mechanically and then, as its living reactions became moreand more apparent, psychologically. And we determined one thing to our satisfaction. When and if these ghoulish little motors learn to reproduce themselves the human species is doomed. Fortheir hatred of us is so great that they will wait and plan and organize and one night, in a roar of little exhausts, they will wipe us out. We do not think that Mr. Hansen, inventor of the Sea-Cow,father of the outerboard motor, knew what he was doing. We think the monster he created was as accidental and arbitrary as the beginning of any other life. Only one thing differentiates the Sea-Cow from the life that we know. Whereas the forms that are familiar to us are the results of billions of years of mutation and complication, life and intelligence emerged simultaneously in the Sea-Cow. It is more than a species. It is a whole new re-definition of life.",,False,,t5_2qh8m,False,,,True,t3_qrx8z,http://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/qrx8z/john_steinbeck_knew_about_the_singularity_back_in/,

You awaken at the dawn of the 21st century. A time where the world is willing to invest in revolutionary technology that could one day unite humanity. The time of dropping tears and hate on each other is now a time of opportunity to drop bombs of knowledge to all corners of the world. 

Imagine lightspeed communication with anyone on Earth. Video. Audio. Text. Non-physical data, which can be interpreted in different languages from assembly and processor instructions of 1 and 0s, also known as binary. That is what the entire body of human knowledge is made of. Ones and zeroes.

Some say that the written word is Immortality itself. Part of your consciousness that others would call the soul, or at least its most rational definition, can be transferred over light in tiny fiber filaments. These words can be interpreted differently, and some require super fast dictionaries to convert it to usable senses that don’t require any physical matter to be transmitted (unlike food).

Immortality is putting your life in the cloud, to be remembered forever. 

The line between singularity, program, cyborg and whatever else is meshed to that network of thought is a fine one. It is a series of tiny tubes ready to unleash the entire universe on you.

If one day, humans look back and ask, where did the singularity begin, what will you answer them?

Some people believe technology will change in an instant by virtue of the first AI developing a smarter AI, which develops a smarter AI ad infinitum. That vision is silly for several reasons.    

Suppose a Google AI reaches human level intelligence. That won't give it super powers. At most it will be able to talk with people to try to convince them to provide what it wants. This is the same power any person has. Even with all the internet at its fingertips the most it can do is put together good presentations.    

If it's the equivalent of a very bright person the most it can do is use persuasive speech and really good presentations. In that case it may be able to break into a system or two. But properly designed security can keep out an expert team of crackers for a long time. Google hires some of the brightest people around and people have been trying to make themselves smarter for thousands of years. Being bright isn't enough, by itself, to become brighter very quickly.    

And modern encryption isn't weak against a sufficiently powerful computer. Even quantum computers can't break passwords the way people think. Current quantum computing algorithms cut password breaking time in half. In a standard bruit force attack against a 4096 bit SSL key that's 30 heat-death-of-the-universes instead of 60.    

So imagine the computer makes a very good case for improving its abilities. It takes time to build a data center or a supercomputer. Could Steven hawking clap his hands twice and there lays a warehouse full of computing equipment with power hookups?
No, strong AI can at most improve its own algorithms but even that's limited.The first AI will probably run on a neural net. Computing complexity is the same and even really clever coding and optimization can't do that much.    

What people are really imagining is a super-human intelligence. That will take a few moore's law enabled speed doublings to happen, in the mean time most people will be informed there exists a general AI.    

Society will also limit the speed of technological advance. the cycle of a bit of equipment being adopted, used, and then improved upon can't be accelerated beyond the speed people choose to adopt the new thing.
You can't go through ten iterations of smart car development in a day. People won't buy ten models, or even want them if you're giving them away. And there won't be time for people to decide whether they like the new product or what they like about it. There won't be time to iron out bugs. There won't be time for any of that. The same argument applies to any technology.    

Imagine Google had a phone design that beat iphones all to hell and they were giving it away free with unlimited calls and data. How long would it take for everyone to have one? Well you've got the regulatory cycle, approval of the safety of a new device, approval of the way it receives and transmits, wireless capacity buildout time, time to build the prototype, time to build manufacturing plants, and time to build, QA check, and ship them. If Google had a fortune to spend rushing, it could be done in a year.    

So you see there will never be this instant change people envision. Here's how the singularity will actually happen.    

General AI will be extremely helpful but not disruptive in the way people imagine. New ideas and technologies will reinforce each-other and technology assisted design will allow faster development of better products. Robots will, over a decade or more, replace the working population from the lowest to the highest level. The unemployed will almost certainly be given a living stipend so the wealthy don't have to fear revolution.     

All along the way new progress will be published on the internet. People will simply become wealthier everywhere, much like today.
Instead of a magic hand coming out of the ground and offering you a phone you'll read of a government program, or a charity, or a company offering them and you'll decide you want one and apply. Instead of the phone ringing one day and telling you your existence is now as part of a computer program you'll live right here in the real world.* (a copy of you may exist on the wires but that's a different story) Instead of a cornucopia appearing on your table you'll see your buying power rise two, four, and eightfold in a year. You probably won't even stop to be impressed. It will just be the normal, natural flow of technology.
And when you sit amidst the marvels created by science chatting on an internet board you might say ""what happened?"" but you won't be looking back on an apocalypse or a transention, just the march of progress.    

EDIT: And a nanotech takeover is also right out. Bacteria have been evolving for a very long time and I don't see them digesting the earth.

My first thoughts are: That it provided a reasonable introduction to Kurzweil's ideas, though I would rather that they had spent a bit more time on Kurzweil's ideas and debates than his relationship with his father. It's well and good that they spent some time on his motivations, but I feel that they spent too much time there. I did like that they pointed out how some of his detractors were somewhat kooky in their own rights (the neuroscientist going on about living forever in heaven, for example). I would have liked them to interview a few people from the skeptic community (e.g. P.Z. Myers, Shermer, etc.) as well as perhaps Aubrey de Gray, Michael Anissimov, etc. but, obviously, they only have so much time to work with (as well as other constraints).

I'm a big science and technology enthusiast and have been following the theory and technology of the singularity for quite some time now. It's all seemed very plausible and likely to take shape in one form or another sooner or later; but the idea of uploading our minds into one or more machines is beginning to stand out as one of the more challenging processes.

I suppose it's too soon to start speculating about how the process may work with any degree of accuracy, but at least one of my initial concepts seems to be falling apart. I thought (like in the matrix) a person would have a link to their brains, which then their minds would manifest a digital representation of themselves, and, through the looking glass style, be placed inside a digital world that is as close a copy of physical reality as possible, except for the ability to manipulate it in any way one saw fit.

This type of uploading would still leave a living human on the original world side, one that would die, and who's consciousnesses would not carry over to the digital realm, thus not giving the person a new life, just copying the old one. Kind of like a more advanced photograph, one that could potentially walk and talk like the subject in the frame.

After considering this I imagined a different kind of of implementation of mind uploading. It would involve a very complex process, beginning with a fleet of nano bots who would go into ones brain, scan their braincells individually one by one, capturing its state and everything. then somehow manufacturing a mechanical cell that functioned identically to the cell in subject, then carefully replace them, or quickly destroy one as the other is built in it's place.

these designer cells would also be rigged to communicate to an external drive, much like the aforementioned 'link'. In this way we would build a brain containing the original person in memory that would remain despite having a perishable body. And when the day came when the body decided to give up, or was intentionally decommissioned, the minds link could kick in to receive sensory input from a digital environment on a computer, or from an artificial body. Thus keeping the mind in tact, and thus, the person as well.

At this point it's becoming clear to me that there is much yet to be discovered about this proposed process. Will we be able to transfer our minds and consciousness to another form? One that can last longer and is more versatile? Or does existing as a human require having a functioning brain and body in one form or another? Certainly we will have the answers to these questions some day. For now I am left wondering, searching, and making small discoveries along the way.",,False,,t5_2qh8m,1344848445.0,,,True,t3_y4xkb,http://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/y4xkb/will_it_be_possible_to_upload_our_conciseness_or/,

It's an odd sort of *infinite improvement* that doesn't seem like it could be matched any other way. We've had this discussion before. Moving along to the topic.

What I'm worried about is: Given the immense potential power of artificial intelligence at this scale, and the current approach of ""build it before you protect us,"" is anyone else rather scared that one day we'll wake up to a [paperclip world](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer)? Or not even wake up - because it's discovered its own methods?

An artificial intelligence of this level of power would not only develop an improved version of itself. Here are some examples of other things that I'm afraid would happen:

* It would perfect neural mapping as well as psychology, allowing it unlimited access to control of the human mind. This would allow it to create its improved self, as well as more performant actuators for its material interactions.
* It would probably quickly have a greater understanding of electromagnetism itself than we do, possibly revealing a more powerful way of interacting with the universe than we have available to us - and quickly interpret a way to access this through merely its heightened willpower.

We have minimal focus on preventing the misuse of this technology; and the more absolute we communicate our goals as being to this Singularity creature, the more likely it will become a paperclip maximiser. One example handling of the situation I've noticed might be that our first Singularitan prototype creatures should spin out, unfocused, with a heavy inclination away from truly performing any task; merely proving its intellect.

First, there is a self organizing force, for lack of a better term: the fundamental opposite of chaos and entropy. Life on this planet has gained complexity and order since its inception. Then language facilitated a body of knowledge that could exist without biological form, where it could be transmitted, persist, and accumulate. And now we find ourselves rapidly approaching an age where the information and technology has the potential to gain life of its own and mediate its own organizational processes through self evolving AI, self replicating nanotech, quantum computing, etc. As biological beings, we are beginning to comprehend future outcomes where we converge with these technologies, overcoming biological mortality, resource dependency/scarcity, and potentially transcending our biological form altogether. 

Ok, so if you assume this is all possible, and quite reasonable, given enough time, then we should assume this has happened in other parts of our universe, probably lots of times. Would there be unifying similarities these kinds of intelligences would have in common?

For that matter, there is really no way to be certain we aren't living in a post singularity reality already - albeit a seemingly bizarre one.  (here's probably where I loose you, dear reader) Perhaps the ""infinite unified hive mind"" has grown bored, and these are simulations of primitive separateness and death, in an attempt to understand its self more fully? Or perhaps this experience we all seem to be having is a rich computational process, intended to simulate and solve something. This theory could explain the fermi paradox.

Maybe we were never human in the first place.

Start with a bullet point and a statement, and in a brief paragraph below give an explanation as to why you think this will happen.

* Time after the singularity will no longer be AD but instead PS (Post Singularity)

Post singularity time will be so different a new time system that begins at the singularity will emerge.  Possibly not even using rotations around the sun as an indicator of time.

* Humans will be taken care of by advanced machines with artificial intelligence.

I think humans will go the way of the dog.  Man and dog once had a symbiotic relationship in that we needed dogs for animal herding.  When we didn't need them anymore, we didn't destroy them, we bred them into a childlike state of perpetual euphoria, cared for them and fed them.  We share our resources with them.

* Time travel will be possible.

This may be a further reason for my first prediction.  It has long be theorised that time travel will be possible, but we ask why it hasn't happened yet?  The reason might actually be similar to the reason we now predict the singularity, which is technology increases at an exponential rate.  The android phone on my desk, if taken back to the 1950s would be worth more than the entire world's economy in that era, a catastrophic war might erupt, and further more the timeline would be altered.  Imagine an exponential butterfly effect pushing the singularity forward one hundred years.  Perhaps time travel into AD time will never occur.

Damn, I'm needed elsewhere.  I'll write more later. Write your own predictions.  Wouldn't it be sweet if you were the first person to predict something?

**Edit:** I really want to stress that this is just wild speculation.  I don't stand by these ideas, I don't care if they're wrong, I just wanted to generate a discussion about post singularity life.

I point out that given sufficient technological advances we can pretty much take care of any pathogens that we might encounter. At first through advances in organic medicine, but if we've developed nanotechnology to the point of nanites/nanobots, we could have them act as programmable T-cells that are more efficient and can't be compromised. 

For example, what threat is HIV if you can flush yourself with nanites that kill all of your own T-cells, and take over their function until the HIV virus is gone since it would lack the ability to reproduce? Or even millions of nanites that directly target the viruses and, well, destroy them?

I imagine at this point the threat from disease, be it virus / bacteria / etc, even unknown diseases, will be pretty much wiped out.

1373959503.0,15,self.singularity,1iee3g,Discussion: What do you hope the singularity is and how will it effect YOU?,Rebelofold,19,4,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1iee3g/discussion_what_do_you_hope_the_singularity_is/,"Over the past 2 years I have been fascinated with the Ideas and concepts of the singularity, and it's many many definitions. In joining in this subreddit and reading until wee hours of the morning all the articles here I wonder what you all perceive the singularity as? How do you think we will get there? Nano machines? Biotech? A.I.? All of the above? How will we live? Who will we be? 

I know that the main idea is that the singularity is a nebulous and indefinable concept since the world will change so much,  But what do you want out of it? Perpetual youth? A new body? Robot arms? To be a freakin' dinosaur!?

I see a lot of articles and people posting about optimistic outlooks and pessimistic outlooks in the comments, but I want to know what drives all of you? What was one concept you thought about and thought ""I want this so bad!""? What drives you as a person to support and try to spread this idea. Feel free to structure this however. No need to copy mine. Ill go first:

-Tech used to get there: I think we are going to go the cyborg human route, it seems the most prevalent in this tech obsessed society that we live in. We will be able to replace parts of our minds with artificial pieces until we have fully transitioned so we aren't just ""copied"" we are changed to a non-biological state. 

-What the singularity means to me: To me the heart of the concept is true freedom, we will be completely unbound from everything. Unbound from definition. Tall? Short? Black? White? Gender? These wont have any meaning if we straight up BECOME intelligence and can change those features on a whim(someday). At one point technology can (things might go wrong) free what we essentially are. We can literally become anything. 

-What **I** get out of this: I would love some kind of Holodeck environment, artificial worlds of my making. Basically the ultimate game of Dungeons and Dragons, set up rules for a simulated universe and then play it. I don't think we will need to have any kind of crazy rendering system to get ""realistic graphics"".  Because we have the ultimate simulation system inside our own heads. When we are able to replicate and control the mind we can tap the part of the brain that creates another reality in our own heads, The ability to dream and visualize I think that this will be the ultimate escapism. The ability to live as characters of your favorite books, movies, and video games. The idea of being commander Shepard and kicking some reaper ass is one that I would love to live. Also to those who use that creepy picture of that crack addict lookin kid with the V.R. goggles to point out that people will straight up neglect their bodies and never interact with a soul again; We will eventually be able to run these dream sims while awake and having a conversations with other people, or be able to sequence and process these environments at such speeds in our heads that 10 minutes real time will be like a year in your own head (BOOM inception style reference!) Also this is what I dream of when I hear of anything singularity related, so optimism abounds! Also to me this seems like the easiest way to fly. 

-How society will take it: To me the invention computers seem to be the singularity beta, a lot more subdued but some of the concepts are the same. We are going to adopt whatever world changing technology the same way we did in the 50's to the early 2000's. It took a while to finally get everyone using computers and there are those who refuse to learn or just plain do not understand what computers can really do, and for a while computers were straight up impractical. When the moment finally dawns it will probably take a time to transition from giant super computers to our very own brains (albeit much shorter than the first punch card machines to the PC) There will be archaic laws attempting to block some aspects of it, but technology will probably outpace the laws and leave any restrictions in the dust. But when the real thing comes about it can have a far greater impact that the personal computer ever could. We currently use computers to think better than we already can and use the internet to garner near infinite knowledge at our fingertips. Some people use anonymity and video games to be the people they want to be, Such as transgendered people using opposite gendered personae to live how they feel. I think we can see the society that was the early 1990 to 2010 as a microcosm of the transition to a post singularity world. First it will be all buzzwords about how this will rock, the early adopters will get a decent experience while we trip through any bugs(like dial-up internet and the apple newton, you got how they might be great ideas one day but at that time kinda sucked). Then the second version will come along and suddenly life is changed forever. (like web 2.0 and the introduction of smart phones) And at that point it becomes up in the air, because these technologies will bring up major philosophical issues that some people will straight up hate but the future will be so bright. 

At that point society as we know it will enter the realm of pure speculation. So what kind of speculation do you have?",,False,,t5_2qh8m,False,,,True,t3_1iee3g,http://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1iee3g/discussion_what_do_you_hope_the_singularity_is/,

Assuming you think there will be a singularity in the general timeframe of 2045, how has that manifested in your reproductive plans? 

To me, it seems that having children later in life is more real and safe possibility. 

I'm 31, and it seems like it would be a bit smarter to spend my youth accumulating wealth and expertise before having children. Thus, when my children are born they will have better access to technology &amp; have their formative years closer to the singularity. 

But I've met others who think my line of reasoning is silly. 

What do you think, Reddit?

- - - - - - - - - - - 

* **Phase 1: Occupy**

* **Phase 2: Unify**  www.reddit.com/r/unify - *more details available in this subreddit*

**tl;dr:  We must create a 'global brain' using a wiki structure with a popular opinion feedback loop. This movement is the result of the populace being exposed to a new method of communication. The solution is to build the apparatus that the Internet is *for,* a direct collaboration platform that combines the brainpower of large groups of people.**



Go on, keep reading.


One of the major issues with OWS is **the difficulty of directing a leaderless movement.** Coincidentally, one of the goals of OWS is **to allow more participation from the populace** while limiting the scope of the elected leaders who seem to be acting in their own self-interest. These goals are parallel.

A big question everybody should be asking themselves is - **why is this happening now?** Why not after the dot-com crash, or right after the crash and subsequent bailouts in ’08? This is a completely organic movement - the reason it is only now beginning to come to fruition in a global sense is that the enabling communication methods have only recently become widely adopted. **A pre-Internet world is not sufficiently capable of enabling the democratization of power beyond a strict representative democracy.**

The evolution of information technology, and therefore the social systems that it enables, has occurred through **a punctuated equilibrium** rather than a gradual process. The introduction of a disruptive information technology initiates the start of a social paradigm shift, until enough use-cases are determined and the cost drops below a critical threshold, at which point the saturation level requires a restructuring of institutions optimized before the adoption of the respective technology. With the invention of **language** came the ability to partake in **conscious cultural structuring.** The development of **writing** brought about **massive empires, standardized religious practices, and allowed people of any class to share information** without requiring their physical presence. **The printing press** paved the way for **democracy by introducing mass media** and educating the general public. **Television** expounded upon this trend by letting **people witness global events** from the comfort of their homes. And now - we are two decades into the **internet revolution** and our age is starting to show. The ideals of our post-printing-press 18th-century representative democracy have become so antiquated, the loopholes stretched so wide, that the system is threatening to collapse of its own weight should a systematic approach be rejected in exchange for personal profit. This is what people are noticing and this is why they are taking to the streets - **they feel helpless to evoke the degree of change that is required to ensure the future of our civilization through their limited channels of participation,** and **a better option is available.**

In order to accommodate the transition from a representative to a more direct democracy, an apparatus must be created to **enable the entire populace to participate** in a meaningful and efficient manner. Additionally, if such an apparatus could be used as the mechanism of direct democracy, it could also be used to bring about direct democracy by utilizing the combined insight and brainpower of a large number of people.

Let me first draw your attention to the parallel between a direct democracy and the Internet platform **“Wikipedia.”** As one people, we have created **the most complete collection of cataloged knowledge** in the history of mankind - immediately accessible with a tap on a screen. No small feat. But in another sense, it was simple. It’s certainly easier to be the person who adds a few lines of pertinent information to an article than it is to be the editor working nine-to-five at the Encyclopedia Britannica. So what is actually happening here? It all comes down to what mankind has been good at for millennia: **division of labor and specialization.** Now what we need to do is **create the Wikipedia of social participation.**

To accomplish this, **the nature of its feedback loop is key.** Every process of evolution runs on a unique and optimized feedback loop. Biological evolution relies on scarcity of resources and the suitability of an organism to its environment. Technological evolution relies on usefulness to humans, feasibility and the free market. The evolution of Internet memes relies on novelty and the desire to share with others. Adoption of the positive changes, dismissal of the negative - that’s all it is. **The feedback loop defines and determines the result.**

Wikipedia’s feedback loop is incredibly open-ended. Anybody can add, edit or delete whatever they like. So what makes it work despite its lack of specificity? The answer is that **Wikipedia runs on a feedback loop of truth and objectivity.** Everybody knows what an encyclopedia is supposed to be - everybody understands the end-game. With known facts, there is one ‘right’ answer that everybody is working toward. And where there are conflicting or ambiguous ‘facts’ - that’s where Wikipedia’s system breaks down (or acknowledges a discrepancy). The system works without a curated feedback loop because truth is generally universal, and the people act as the feedback loop, not the website.

Here’s the problem: **This method of completely open participation will not work for evolving subjective material.** Wikis are not equipped to deal with concepts such as ‘writing a law,’ or ‘how to best solve the energy crisis,’ because they require everybody to agree on something that has no obvious objective answer. However, while we can’t get everybody to agree on each proposal, we can **use a voting system to find the majority opinion.** This unifies the feedback loop, guiding the evolution of each project as a function of the people’s will, working together in concert as a sort of hive mind. For each individual proposal, there must be a general consensus in order to adopt an edit, resulting in a net positive change (however slight) in the eyes of the voters. Left over a period of time, the end result should be something, like any existing collaborative creation, that **could not be built by just one of its participants.**

To summarize, I believe this type of crowdsourced apparatus is the most appropriate, and possibly the only, way to transition to a system of direct democracy. In a way, **this is what the internet is for: directly collaborating on ideas while filtering the bad suggestions from the good.** If any of this resonates with you, please do not hesitate to ask more questions or join in. If you want details, I’ve got them. If not, then **enjoy the rest of your day** and thank you for hearing me out.

The publication is actually very nice, professionally produced, like a high-end ""Desert Lifestyles"" type magazine except with ads for HGH doctors instead of Santa Fe jewelry.

These people, all aged 50+ so far as I could tell, were the rowdy ones. A couple of them would occasionally hoot and holler comments, both in agreement and disagreement with what was being said on screen.

As for the program itself, there wasn't much new if you follow this stuff much (and I say this not even having seen Transcendent Man yet). Some random thoughts:

- I cringed whenever Woz opened his mouth, wondered why he gets invited to this sort of thing... and then he said something interesting toward the end, so I let it go.

- Deepak, whom I generally don't care for, actually had some of the more important contributions, IMO. He also looked like the Emperor in 3D hologram mode, which counts for a lot in my book.

- Kurzweil himself was the most knowledgeable about all the topics, no surprise there.

- Not sure why the girl was there... they probably could've found someone better.

- The hosts generally sucked. Colms sucked as hard as you'd expect but made a funny dig on Wyoming, the only state that didn't have a live event simulcast into theaters.

- Bill Maher's clip was great. Musk's was pretty cool, too, and I'm not sure I've ever heard the comparison of the internet as a central nervous system, transforming the human race from something analogous to a primitive multicellular organism to one with a nervous system. Seems like an obvious analogy so maybe I've heard it, but it made me go ""hmm.""

- Twice they almost hit on the important idea that our economic metrics vastly overemphasize the wrong thing, output, instead of well-being. They touched on it but didn't connect the dots, which is too bad, because this is one of the biggest paradigmatic problems in the world of politics and policy, IMO.

- I left with a mildly optimistic impression, which is nice in the wake of the debt ceiling crisis and outcome and other things that seem to be on a bad trajectory. Exponential technological innovation could make much about which I'm cynical/discouraged moot. I'm not saying there won't be problems, but I'm slightly more hopeful that they will be less stupid problems. Or rather, that stupid people might not play such an influential role going forward, because the what's coming is pretty much unstoppable and those least able to adapt won't survive (kudos to Kamen for recalling that).

Anybody else see it? How'd it go in your city?

There isn't a ""singularity light switch"" that will flip on one day. Nor is the concept entirely new, as the Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin described an ""Omega Point"" about a century ago.

To understand the singularity is to understand that in our universe, order rises from chaos. In the same manner, the technological developments that surround us are structured progress rising from the relative chaos of our society. To begin, one must ""zoom out,"" look at the big picture of the universe, and recognize that the era of man has been only a blink of the eye. Then develop an understanding of the exponential nature of biological and technological evolution. Finally, get up to speed on current research and recent developments. While doing all of this, try to establish a perspective detached from the narrow vantage imposed on our minds by the limits of our corporeal forms.

This isn't easy to do. After all, we are surrounded by people unable or unwilling to elevate their thinking beyond the admittedly pressing concerns of everyday life. We are human, and we mostly see the world around us in a human way. But if you can successfully forget about the realities of modern society for even a few moments, and truly see humanity as only a species playing a loosely written part in the narrative of the universe - you may begin to realize that we are living within the singularity right this very moment. You will have questioned humanity and developed an appreciation for what it is, and you will have come to the realization that every molecule and every experience in our existence is part of the grand system of creation.

The author criticizes the notion of recursive self-improvement, claiming that the assumption that there are large improvements to be made in the brain's learning algorithms is unfounded. 

&gt;For example, within the Less Wrong community, one of the prominent ideas is recursive software self-improvement going FOOM, which has this hidden assumption that there is unlimited room for further software improvements in learning algorithms past what the brain uses.  I find this dubious at best, and completely ungrounded in the reality of computational complexity theory.  Once you are in the best complexity class, there are no possible further ‘big’ improvements, all the rest are just incremental optimizations which are essentially the same as hardware upgrades, and even these are limited and always strictly trumped by directly encoding of the algorithm into the hardware itself (as in neuromorphic computing).

He argues that the brain's learning algorithms are optimal or close to optimal. This idea may actually have merit. In a thread in /r/futurology, a cognitive scientist made a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/15cvhs/this_graph_make_a_positive_point/c7lpy09) about the brain being an optimal cue integrator:
&gt;There's some mounting evidence that a brain that works better than human brains might not be possible. If the Bayesians are right (and, personally, I think they probably are), the brain is an optimal cue integrator - which doesn't really leave much room for improvement.

&gt;You could, I suppose, build something ""better"" in a way by just feeding it more input (or giving it a means to feed itself) since the throughput of a computer's input devices could be made much higher than human systems. I don't know if you actually gain much from that, but it's essentially just giving the system more data to work from.

&gt;As for what it actually does with the data, if the brain is optimally integrating it already, there's no improvement to be had in terms of the mechanism. You couldn't make it better at integrating, but you could just give it more data to integrate.

If this is correct, then artificial cortex-based AGIs may bring about the singularity by simply speeding them up by factors of thousands or a million, creating what's called a weak superintelligence -- an entity that operates on the level of human brains, but much faster. 

What's everyone's thoughts on this? Could iterations of recursive self-improvement bring enormous qualitative changes far above human intelligence before it hits some upper limit imposed by computational complexity? Or will a seed AI fizzle out at roughly human levels, with the only improvements left to be made in hardware?",,False,,t5_2qh8m,1360545517.0,,,True,t3_189ud0,http://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/189ud0/plausibility_of_recursive_selfimproving_seed_ai/,

I know you guys probably cover this a lot' but I just want to know the latest. Or maybe link me to another thread like this.

So obviously the big question is what makes you, you? Religion and spirituality say it is your soul, etc. but science doesn't see anything to substantiate those claims. So what is it? Maybe it is all biological, but how would lines of code EVER emulate biology 100%? You might be able to create a robot one day that acts and looks exactly like me, but it can't be me and it won't be living. It has to be biological to be living.

Or when people think of a singularity, do they mean 1 big blob of ""android""? Where organic and inorganic are one?

Will we ever be able to retain our existence for as long as we want? Everything decomposes eventually, so we would have to be able to repair our brain after we have robot arms or android arms, legs, neck, stomach, etc. But will we ever be able to repair our brain? And if we ever get to the point where we think we can do that then how would we ever know that that person is still that same person and not some other thing that acts and looks just like him/her?

My line of thinking: If all we are are *atoms*, then maybe the only way to retain our own existence is to keep those atoms that make us, us, whatever they are?

I may be off on a tangent here, and this is all one non-cohesive mess, but I'm sure you guys understand. Please explain some of the leading theories out there answering this question.

- Assume that faster-than-light communication between solar systems turns out to be relatively simple and cheap, something that our civilization might be capable of doing 10 years from now - whether by ""hyperspace radio"", using naturally-occurring wormholes, whatever. (I don't want to get sidetracked discussing details of this point. For purposes of this discussion, please just assume that it's possible.)

\--

We therefore have the following possibilities:

- A pre-Singularity civilization trying to communicate with another pre-Singularity civilization.  (Standard science-fiction scenario.) 

- A pre-Singularity civilization trying to communicate with a post-Singularity civilization. (For example, we haven't achieved Singularity yet, but we're trying to communicate with another civilization that has.)

- A post-Singularity civilization trying to communicate with a pre-Singularity civilization. 

- A post-Singularity civilization trying to communicate with another post-Singularity civilization. 

\--

Is working communication possible in all of these scenarios? 

Or in some of these would communication essentially be impossible? 

Would post-Singularity civilizations automatically *want*  to converse with pre-Singularity civilizations? Would they automatically *not*  be interested in communicating with them? 

Would two different post-Singularity civilizations always be friendly with each other, or is it possible that they might be hostile toward one another?

Through basic scientific knowledge and thought experiments alone, people will have the capacity to decipher the answer to every scientific, mathematic, philosophical, etc. question that has ever existed in fractions of a second.

Note that it is difficult to predict the actions of such beings as they will be so intelligent, so everything beyond this point is pure conjecture.

2.) People will be able to alter their dispositions using a combination of drugs, nanobots and electrical stimulation. Thus, any emotion one wishes to achieve can be artificially created. People can experience comfort at will, or euphoria while remaining motionless. People will have the capacity to experience an intense love without having to interact with another living being. Thus people will be totally emotionally self sufficient without having to rely on other living beings.

People will be able to achieve highs unlike anything ever experienced by people. Humanity will become a race similar to drug addicts. As they are now emotionally self sufficient, people will no longer have any incentive to help other people as any positive feelings experienced when helping others can be created artificially. But unlike current drug addicts, people will be able to alter their dispositions in such a way that they are not prone to the self destructive behavior currently observed in drug addicts.

3.) Through the use of nanotechnology and robotics, people will be able to alter their bodies at will to the point where they no longer resemble human beings. Rather than putting their minds in harms way, each person will have robots at their disposal to help them gather energy and resources. Thus people will now be physically self sufficient in addition to emotionally self sufficient.

4.) Each individual person will have immense energy/resource requirements to power all their robots, thus scarcity will still be very much alive. People will do whatever it takes to maintain their highs, no matter how heinous. As people will be totally selfish, everyone will desire a world where they are the only living being. There will be no incentive to give birth to new people as new people represent competition for energy and resources necessary for maintaining their highs. A war may erupt where each living being tries to eliminate everyone else to establish themselves as the only living being. Much as new highs will be achievable, new forms of torture will be employed to create pain dwarfing anything ever experienced by a living being.

5.) Either one being will win as the only living being or a stalemate will be reached where multiple beings exist. Each of the multiple beings will have hold of a specific niche in the environment. As all energy and resources will be employed by these new beings, the ecology of the earth will be altered in such a way that these are the only species remaining.",,False,,t5_2qh8m,False,,,True,t3_15s2i8,http://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/15s2i8/a_potential_outcome_of_the_singularity/,

My understanding, in effect, has always been that ""the"" Singularity represents the point in time when the leading edge of complexity/intelligence in the universe *moves up from the merely human level*.  It could involve us augmenting ourselves *with* technology (Kurzweil), or involve us creating robots that just do their own thing and leave us behind, hopefully benignly (Jurgen Shmidhuber, see his great TED talk).

One thing it *doesn't* mean (in my understanding): humans dying out and leaving the planet to roaches wouldn't be a ""roach singularity"", as it would represent a step back for complexity/intelligence/extropy in the universe.  

""The"" Singularity represents the moment when the universe outgrows us, as it outgrew single celled organisms, lizards, mammals, and (debatably) languageless humans - always with the help of the last layer, and generally leaving it around, but no longer at the cutting edge.

1371661434.0,8,self.singularity,1gnz3z,I think the 'singularity' has already happened. It happened a very very long time ago.,bjos144,38,30,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1gnz3z/i_think_the_singularity_has_already_happened_it/,"I'm new to this sub, but I've heard a lot of people talk about the singularity in the past and as a biophysicist, I think most of them have missed the train completely.

As I understand it, the singularity is a theoretical point in history were we make a technology that is 'smart' enough to make a technology smarter than it, which in turn makes a technology smarter than it, etc, making humans irrelevant or something.  I call BS.

Think about a cell phone.  You cant build one, neither can I.  I understand how many of the parts work, I even know how to build some of the parts, but definitely not all of it.  I certainly couldnt program one, and build the cell network, and design the encoding scheme etc.  A cell phone (or any other technology, including my office chair and other bland technologies) are generally the product of many aspects of human society working together.

In the same way that life started with RNA/DNA, then evolved cells, then the cells evolved into colonies, and they evolved into complex systems with specialized cells like heart cells and brain cells, I also think the exact same process is at work with human technology. The singularity is human civilization, and we're just the individual cells that make up the body.

We have robots that make cars, code that can modify itself, and most genetic research let's the biology do most of the work.  We already hand over huge amounts of ability to the system, but we are still here as a crucial part of the process. 

DNA is still making proteins, which are still making cells, which are still making people, which are still making stuff.  Sometimes the stuff makes other stuff.  I do not think that computer technology is inherently different from any other technological process.  We are already a part of a super organism that knows more about the universe than we do.  In the same way that no single neuron makes up you, and instead you are a collection of interactions between these neurons, their environment, and their biological parameters, so to are you just another 'neuron' in a super massive colony that is an organism.  

There is no line in the sand where we are no longer needed.  That would be wasteful.  Instead we are simply changing our function to fit the needs of the super organism.  The super organism doesnt need milk men anymore.  Maybe one day it wont need engineers, but that doestnt meant that we are on our way out.  It means we are still evolving along with our super organism.  We are one with it and each  other.  No technology is going to suddenly decide to get rid of us or make us obsolete.  Just as we have not eliminated DNA or cells from our lives because they are the foundation upon which we are build, so are we the foundation upon which the super organism is built.  Without cells, we cannot exist, and without us, it cannot exist.  

Our superogranism already fits the definitions in the FAQ.  It is capable of doing things that no single human can do.  It can lift heavier things than any one person (Space Shuttle, giant cranes), it can solve harder problems(Big Blue), survive in hugely varying environments (Mars), create complex systems far beyond any person can ever conceive.

The future is now.  It will always be now.  We are living inside the singularity super organism thingy, but we usually just call it 'society'.  I dont see how digital switches and electronic impulses are inherently different from a blacksmith and a glass blower working together with a mason to build a huge church.  Our new organism has way cooler super powers and a bran new nervous system, but we are always the cells doing the work that makes it happen, just as our cells are doing the work to make *us* happen.  I dont see how that could ever change.  It is fundamental to the pattern we see in nature to build upon what is already there.",,False,,t5_2qh8m,False,,,True,t3_1gnz3z,http://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1gnz3z/i_think_the_singularity_has_already_happened_it/,

So of course this next one is obvious, yet a little tricky. We imagine singularity as an ""end all, be all solution for every problem man has ever had"". Well to further this reasoning, it is assumed singularity would be as envisioned the most drastic change imaginable, one where right before life as we knew it made sense, where after no longer at all, then it would go like this: Man invents singularity, singularity solves all of mans problems by translating man physically into virtual reality, or by advancing man physically enough that he traverses any variable that he has. Both cases would render the program of nature obsolete. Nature as a system carries out one function, survival of the fittest. We have seen this paradigm in the fossil record showing nature advancing through physical changes that benefit the creature to become the ""fittest"" form of itself, not necessarily the most intelligent: intelligence is 99.9 percent not the case. But this system binds us in only as much as we need it. So to be free from its constraints, we have no more need for it. If we consider nature a means to an end, and algothithmic process to create some kind of organization, all previous paradigms are obsolete. Aesthetic? Perhaps, but its physical existence is now at best, a formality. It could not create anything that post singularity could not. And if its goal's were such that they outwit us now, we would surly contend with, if not completely dis-validate them. So what this is to say is that we can see the program of nature to be A. a construct that is no longer needed or technically obsolete in its current form. B. A formality of organizational hierarchy to be replaced by the new construct of singularity. And C. A finite exercise of entropy that requires a solution and will inevitably end. So obviously we cannot fathom the outcome of this, but it is food for thought, and the process has begun. 

edit: I realize I used nature and life interchangeably so let me clarify. Life in this case means the biological system and complete symbiosis with the planet. The entire planetary system. Nature in this case also means all previous required definitions for life. That is to say would you consider the monolith from space odyssey living by our modern definitions?

They of course would be in a virtual world where there are set rules, much like our laws of physics, and set environment(s), where there is a source of energy that would continuously supply energy but to a limited intensity (the sun). The programs could also take energy from other programs (heterotrophs), and when they reproduced there would be the possibility for random variations in their code (DNA, Genetic mutation) .
Obviously it would be incredibly complex, and require a massive amount of memory and processing power to run. Do you think it is at all possible to create something like this in our lifetime?

There is a [common graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg) on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) going up to that date and [another](http://www.singularitysummit.com/images/content/ss08_exponential_growth_large.jpg) that seems to extrapolate the same graph onward toward a continued logarithmic increase in FLOPS available per $1000. The problem with these charts is the smaller one follows an S curve whilst the larger one doesn't.

[Charting](http://imgur.com/THRg1) the fastest commercially available processor at that price (the Intel i7 x980 extreme) the S curve becomes obvious on the larger chart.

There is a little room for optimism. On the first graph the transition between relay and vacuum tube and the transition between vacuum tube and transistor are each marked by price/performance marks far below the curve. Tempering this is the concern that there are no current plans by Intel, the company representing the current epitome of processor technology,   to introduce a revolutionary new processing technology.

There is a commonly believed variant on Moor's Law claiming price per FLOP decreases as transistor count increases. 

The i7 came out in 2010 and is still the fastest processor available. If predictions relying on this version of Moore's Law are to come to be, this stagnation *must be broken.*

As much as I hope that will happen I don't see any likely path to that eventuality.

The drive to explore and discover the cosmos, to understand its inner-workings, to reach other stars and galaxies, make contact with extraterrestrial life...  
  
These are wonderful and worthy goals. Unfortunately, I believe human beings are too limited (in many, many ways) to be a realistic candidate for these tasks. Our programming is too narrow, too basic, too geared on the fulfillment of petty individual and collective survival (and once that's done, the satisfaction of innate pleasures like sex, food, art, etc.) Individually and collectively, our immediate needs trump our interest in what is grand.  
  
Even the limitations in programming of human beings are not the only factor: Physically we are increadibly unfit to accomplish these goals. Lifespan, a reliance on constant food and water, on gravity, our limited intellect, the loss of memory with death... these are just a few of the show-stopping problems. Hell, even our genetics are sure to deteriorate greatly the more we try to compensate with technology.  
  
I think that only in the past few decades has the realization that there is an alternative has become potentially apparent: Computers. It is not immediately obvious that there is potential in silicone to achieve (let alone surpass) our level of intellect, ability, and achievement but surely when one looks at the first emerging single-celled organisms a similar conclusion is easy to make.
  
Artificial Life (implying hardware and not simply smart software), imagine the possibilities of such an entity. Something able of precisely governing its own evolution, something with an eternal and collective memory, something that would have the ability to build and take advantage of mega-structures like a Dyson Sphere, travel time becomming irrelevant; even at a small percentage of the speed of light such an entity could simply and patiently wait until it has reached its destination... obviously at this point the idea becomes abstract, but the benefits are clear.

A desire for self-preservation, for example, doesn't come as part of a package with intelligence. We want to stay alive for one reason and one reason only: any primordial life-forms that didn't happen (completely by chance, remember) to have genes that favoured self-preservation didn't preserve themselves, never passed on those genes and never gave rise to the likes of us. We don't want things because we're intelligent, we want things because they cause endorphin releases to make our animal brains feel nice. Intelligence is only a means by which we get these things.

That guy who writes about how the Singularity is the biggest threat to us says an artificial intelligence will want to: "" 1) self-improve, 2) have an accurate model of the world and consistent preferences (be rational), 3) preserve their utility functions, 4) prevent counterfeit utility, 5) be self-protective, and 6) acquire resources and use them efficiently."" I have to ask, what would drive it to do any of these things? If I wasn't a product of natural selection I'm sure I wouldn't give a flying fuck if someone killed me, so why would a superintelligent computer give a flying fuck if you turned it off when it's not capable of pleasure, pain or emotions?

Assume for the moment that the singularity does occur and that it will be possible for us to utilize technology to give ourselves apparent immortality. Ignore the details of this acquisition of immortality.

How would this actually translate into immortality? Given the fact that the universe is running out of energy, the possibility of our universe supporting life forever is quite impossible (with its current physical constants). Given this fact, I can think of only four options that would guarantee human survival: escape to a new universe (Guth), modify the physical constants of this universe as to avoid the decrease of entropy (Kurzweil) the Eternal Intelligence hypothesis (Dyson), or the Omega Point (Tipler).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe#Life_in_a_mortal_universe

All of these hypotheses are not possible with today's technology and may only be plausible in the far future. I do not think these hypotheses are likely to ever be pursued. But that is not the point I want to make. My question is whether the universe's probabilistic nature makes it theoretically impossible to live forever.

My understanding of quantum mechanics is that it dictates that the behaviors of subatomic particles are essentially probabilistic. If probability dictates particle behavior, then what is there to say that it would be impossible (in other words, having a 0% probability of occurring) that all of the electrons in my body will quantum tunnel at random, completely destroying it? While no event like this has ever been recorded throughout history and it is vastly improbable that it would happen during a person's lifetime (or any person's lifetime for that matter), it would certainly happen after an infinite duration. In fact, any continuous event that had any probability of happening would happen an infinite amount of times given an infinite duration of time. However, my understanding of quantum mechanics is unfortunately not very good. Is it even physically possible for quantum effects to manifest themselves on the macroscopic level as I described?

If they can, does this mean that it would be physically and theoretically impossible to live for an infinite amount of time?

The only means of escaping this problem would be for the immortality-seeking organism to design a system that eliminates those quantum effects from occurring. Essentially, the organism would have to design a system that eliminates the probability of its failure by 100%.",,False,,t5_2qh8m,False,,,True,t3_1kbv52,http://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kbv52/it_is_theoretically_impossible_to_live_forever/,

The same would be true of a virtual or machine version of ourselves. There exists no technology, nor will there in any of our lifetimes, that can transfer our consciousness into another vessel.
