Out of nowhere my HM2 (E-5) threw open my door and was wondering what was going on.

""Oh sorry Sir, I thought Fluty was in here goofing off"" the HM2 said

""HM2 you dont have to worry about me.. Im squared away like sponge bob"" I replied

well... the Colonel thought that was the coolest thing he heard in a while.. so a few weeks later, much to my surprise, I get called out by my Commander (0-5) for something before the clinic opened... I thought I was in trouble.

She proceeds to hand me this red Marine Corps award packet and inside it was my award.

I displayed it with pride on my desk for months and got a lot of positive feedback from other officers (i was in charge of retirement physicals) until a new hotshot HM2 came to the clinic and thought ""it didnt look professional""... so i had to remove it.

If you are or plan on being a military SO/spouse or whatever, keep in mind a couple of things:

1) The military ALWAYS comes first. So acting like you are the top priority is laughable. You can be replaced and most likely will be if you act like a constant twat.

2) If you can't deal with early mornings, long days, late nights and random ""lock downs"" this isn't the life for you.

3) You have no say in your mans day to day at work. Don't act like you do. You have no business at his company unless you're dropping off cookies.

4) If you can't keep your fucking legs closed. Fuck you. Deployments happen. TDYs happen. VIPs happen. Get a fucking vibrator or get a divorce.

5) If your man complains about being treated badly at work chances are you're with a shitbag. Complaining to his chain of command will only make him more of a laughing stock. Shut your fucking mouth.

6) Get over yourself you're just making his life more difficult by creating issues that should never be fucking issues. STOP BEING A CONTROLLING TWAT.

For fucks sake support your man and he will in turn support you.

/end rant

*This was brought on from hearing a couple stories last night from my SO who is an NCO about a few wives who cant seem to wrap their heads around the lifestyle they married into. If this isnt a proper place for this then please let me know.

Edit: #5 is a personal rant that applies to my SOs company. I've seen it so many times in other units as well and does not apply to everyone. Didn't mean to offend.

Extra special edit: to those with their panties in a wad. This is a personal rant. It's a generalization. It does not apply to every single spouse out there and isn't aimed at anyone in particular. Being pissed at me for ranting when I clearly labeled this as a rant is just silly. To touch on male dependents. I spoke about what I know. I don't know male spouses so I didn't mention them sorry I left you guys out. I wasn't trying to be demeaning or insulting. 
Also: I'm a 30yr old with two jobs and a prior military marriage. I'm not new to this life nor am I ignorant to the exceptions out there.   ",,False,self,t5_2qh8y,1350448041.0,,,True,t3_11kzrx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/11kzrx/a_rant_from_a_military_so_to_other_military_sos/,

Mind you this theater is about 40 minutes from post. Guy's got his feet all over the seats, about fourty pounds overweight, acting an ass, and being loud, so I got fed up and decided to correct this dude. I walk down the aisle and sit beside this dude and try to be tactful but stern about it. The exchange went something like:

Me: Hey private, what's wrong with this picture?

Him: What?

Me: You're dead wrong right now. So what's wrong with this picture?

Him: Dude, who the fuck are you? I don't even know you. (*Still trying to look cool in front of his friends; they look like they're probably also privates, but in civilians*)

Me: I'm a guy who's trying to give you a little professional development because *clearly* nobody's taught you that you're fucked up right now. Why are you in uniform outside of duty hours at the movie theater? Help me understand why you thought this was a good idea. 

Him: Man, fuck off. 

Me: Let's try this a different way. I'm 1st Lieutenant Jhb2wr; what unit are you with.

Him: I don't fucking know you, man. I don't care who you are. Get out of my face. 

Me: Do you really think that's the right answer? 

Him: *ignores me and just stares at the pre show commercials*

Me: What's your name?

Him: Pssh, whatever.

Me: It only gets worse from here. Standby. 

After that I went back to my seat. Finished the movie and left. I've got his last name from his uniform, his face, and his licence plate number, (We left at the same time). But that's all I've got. His unit patch was the same division patch that almost every swinging dick on main post has. I've never wanted to choke slap somebody so hard in my life. So here's my question. How can I follow up on this, because there's no way I'm going to let this go now. I'm planning on seeing my S1 on Monday to hunt this guy down. Any thoughts from someone who's dealt with something like this before?

**Update: As of COB Friday 1MAR13, still no results. Post adjutant couldn't find a PFC of his name, vehicle was unregistered on the installation. Its looking likely that this dude was a faker.

So anyways, this resume says ""Green Beret 3 tours in Iran"" and further on he explains his division and unit and so forth, once again says 3 tours in Iran. He also put ""Helped shut down any terrorist organizations, protects convoys, and completed many extractions"" under the heading of ""The United States of America Military""

My question is, does this seem legit? I might be super ignorant to the subject but I didn't think there was any US military in Iran over the last 7 years. Plus the way he describes his MOS is odd, (""Combat and weapon specialist""). Like I said, I would love to hire more vets, especially in this field (Security), but I just wanted to find out from you guys if this seems legit. I plan on asking my assistant when I see him tomorrow, but I kind of want to find out right now.

EDIT/UPDATE: The problem solved itself, he also listed two college degrees from two different institutions, neither of which offer courses in what his claimed degrees are in. Straight up liar, the fact that someone would be willing to make up a bunch of military experience sucks when there are so many vets looking for work, thank god this guy isn't a better bullshitter.

FINAL UPDATE 5/22/13: So my assistant scheduled the interview with this guy for today at 1100 hrs. He told him to bring his DD-214, DL, Social Security Card, and everything else needed. As of 1220 today, we have not heard anything from the Green Beret.

If you don't have said balls or ladyballs and really must come on reddit, there are plenty of existing threads.  Use the search feature.  It's there for a reason.

Step 2: Those with balls/ladyballs: Tell said recruiter of your past medical issues, juvenile delinquency, reformed drug habit, floppy ear holes from being ""rebellious"" and stupid in high school and show him your GED, diploma, or college degree.

Step 3: Ask said local recruiter to take the ASVAB (note: Do not share your results on this forum looking for us to tell you how smart you are...holy shit... we don't really care and you got a 47.  Not all that good, dude.)

Step 4: If you are enlisting for anything other than the Basic to OCS (except current ROTC/USMA/OCS folks) option because you earned your bachelor's degree already, stop talking about becoming an officer.  Seriously.  Go to basic and AIT and focus on your job right now.

Step 5: Actually ship to basic and don't go AWOL/DFR.  It sucks.  Get used to it.  The thing that unites you to 237 years of military heritage is that it fucking sucked, and continues to suck, for everyone at times.

Step 6: If you actually do something way fucking cool or take a cool picture, share that with us.  If your buddy gets hurt or worse, we're here for you (and him/her).  If you are thinking dark thoughts and have demons from your experiences haunting you; let us know and we'll talk you through it.

Warning: I'm a Marine. I swear a lot. If that's going to hurt your precious little feelings (*looking at you, Air Force*), go back. It's just some broad rambling on and on about sexism or some shit anyway...


*


**Background:**

We just had a young Marine caught with female underwear he had stolen from the barracks laundry room over the course of a few months. 

Just another pervy, misguided dumbass kid... Fuck, I haven't lived in a barracks or gone a deployment yet where my bra &amp; underwear supply doesn't shrink with every trip to the laundry room. It just fucking happens. As awkward as it was gathering the females in my battalions to see if any of them could claim for certain if any of the items were theirs, none of them were surprised, either. It's just kind of something you get used to.

I was taken aback, however, that the men in my unit were surprised by all of this. SgtMaj couldn't look me in the eye when he called me into his office to see if I'd talk to the girls about it, but not just him, none of the highers could deal with it. Sure, guys joked and made fun of the kid, but most of them seemed genuinely surprised that this was happening and even more so that their female counterparts were so blase about the whole thing.

*

**What's going on:**

So, I started thinking about the crazy sort of shit I've gotten used to over the years... We've all become accustomed to rape jokes and sexist comments. Most females have gotten used to drunken facebook messages proclaiming love or infatuation or asking for sex. I've at least come to resent 2/3 of the head shed for being pervy assholes and have grown to resent the slutty opportunists that make higher-ups think their behavior is acceptable. I know that if I'm around any number of drunk male Marines, at least one will try to grab either my tits or ass, that if I didn't make sure to shut my door all the way when I lived in the barracks, some drunken idiot would burst in while I was sleeping and try to climb into my bed. I've heard of male Marines getting a hold of the master key and letting themselves into females' rooms to ""talk"" or ""hang out"" or whatever. As females, we act like it's no big deal. Nobody wants to be the uppity bitch who cries wolf. As a community, we laugh about this shit like it doesn't affect anyone.

It *is* funny, but only to an extent. After that extent, though, man, it's not okay. The fact of the matter is that it blows to spend every day hearing comments about who wants to fuck you, to have guys leer at the gym, to dread seeing 1stSgt because you know he'll say something weird as you're leaving and to not feel safe in your own damn room.    
I'm kind of embarrassed by how alright I've become with this nonsense... and this is just the easy stuff. I'm not even going to get into how rapey the military gets. (CMC is working on it, so we'll see.)

* 

Anyway, what is this crazy old broad going on about? Female servicemembers are all bitches, dykes or whores anyway... well, first of all, sometimes they're bitches or whores because they join young and don't know how to deal with this shit- they either fight back or give in. That doesn't make it okay, but we'll talk about that in a bit.  
This post is for that 1/8th of females that you're cool with. Stop thinking about that uppity, cuntish S-1 clerk. I'm sure you know some chick that's quiet, hardworking and sweet. Think of her. Grunts, fucking think about your sister or something because you're probably going to have to deal with this shit soon enough. (Thank congress, but don't bother bitching about it here. Write another post if you're feeling a diatribe coming on. This is my soapbox, holmes.)

*The point of this is that there's a fucking problem in the military and it's not going to get any better if we don't fucking acknowledge it and talk about ways to fix it.*

**What the fuck can I do, and why should I bother?**

If you have a new female in your unit, she's more than fresh meat- she's an opportunity to stop this cycle from repeating itself. Get her into the gym and PTing hard early on (obligatory warning to ease into and not overtrain or haze). I've noticed that females who work out are far less likely to get their kicks playing twenty toes at the barracks. If she's shy, encourage her to be tactfully assertive when people say inappropriate shit to her. Keep situational awareness. Is she surrounded by a group of guys? Doesn't mean she's a whore- it probably just happened and she doesn't know how to handle it. Dudes are like moths to a flame when a new chick shows up. Get home girl out of there. Introduce her to the few good females you know, and ask them if they'll take her out during off time. Most importantly, if you hear or see some guys talking trash about all they're planning on doing with her or betting on who'll fuck her first, nip that shit in the bud. Sorry to ruin your fun, boys, but there are *plenty of other women in the world*. You don't have to dip your pen in company ink. That's just pathetic... It can't be so hard for you to get laid that you have to prey on some clueless boot, and if it is, you have some personal development to get on with before you drag someone else into your dysfunction.   
Bonus, if you treat her with respect and have her back, she'll have yours. You should know by now that it's good practice to get in tight with supply and admin anyway. Same thing with everyone else in your battalion. You never know what you're going to need or who you'll have to work with in the future. If you don't think that matters, well, I'm writing pro-cons at this point in my career and it's hard to overlook some Marines' conduct when they're jackasses to their peers. I try to be objective, but... yeah, it's hard to overlook. 

We're brothers and sisters in arms, man. We should have each others' backs. Your females shouldn't feel uncomfortable all of the fucking time. Keeping your timid little mouth shut isn't enough. Keep situational awareness. If a female (or fucking anybody, for that matter) looks uncomfortable in a situation and you notice, you can help. Be that simply being there to make sure nothing escalates or finding an excuse to get them out of their awkward conversation or whatever. 


*

Some of you may think this isn't a problem because you don't hear the females you know talk about it. We don't talk about it because a.) some people consider complaining about unwanted attention a humblebrag, and b.) we've been led to believe if it's happening, it must be our own fault. The girls in your life may not say anything, but military or not, they've been harassed and molested at some point, if not constantly. I guaran-fucking-tee it.

1313152554.0,235,self.Military,jgph1,"In 2002 me and a few Sailors　prevented some horrific shit.

",HasheedMajoors,276,41,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/jgph1/in_2002_me_and_a_few_sailors_prevented_some/,"Thought you guys might like to hear about this.

In 2002 the John C. Stennis battle group was steaming towards the Middle East.  We stopped in Changi Naval Base Singapore for a few days of port call.  My duty day was the last day.  That morning when I reported to watch I pulled bus rider for 8 hours.  My watch was to ensure that everybody riding the bus from downtown Singapore had military ID and the proper sticker on their ID Card.  I could only get off the bus at the Naval base and had to stay on for the entire ride into town.  I did however get to wear civilian clothes (khaki pants with a polo shirt tucked in wearing a belt, lucky!!!)

The Bus route took us to someplace downtown where we would park for about 30 minutes and pick up Sailors and Marines.  Everybody getting on the bus had to show proper ID.

This happened at the half way point waiting for Sailors and Marines.

Middle eastern bus driver wearing full Arab garb sans Keffiyah, ""My friend, why don't you go use the bathroom or get a drink.""

Me with headache needing to use bathroom and probably thirsty, ""No, I can wait.  Thank you any ways.""

For the 30 minutes we were parked, he would ask me once or twice if I was ok and if I needed to get off the bus.  My response was always what I had just said more or less.  This continued for my entire watch.

Anyways, it's my second to last ride with the same bus and we are parked at the rendezvous.  He asks me again if I am ok and I respond I am good. 

At this point a guy tries to get on the bus.  He is dressed like any other Sailor and has a backpack, he looks like he could be Filipino.  I ask for his ID and he just looks at me.  Doesn't say anything.  I ask him again, same thing.

Bus driver, ""It's hot outside, let him on?""

Me, ""I can't let him on without ID.  Hey man, did you lose your ID, go tell Security, cause I can't let you on.""  

Again nothing, this guy is outside the bus, just looking at me.  That's when the bus driver starts speaking Farsi or something to this guy and he takes off his back pack and shows it to the bus driver.    He walks away and sits in the shade.  At this point my heart is beating like crazy.

Bus driver is quiet and starts smoking.  I remember I wanted to get off the bus and find a CDO or something but I can't, nobody comes by while we are parked.  I was worried that guy would get on the bus with his bag.

Sailors start coming back and getting on the bus.  I check all their IDs in turn.  We fill up and the bus driver takes us back to Changi.  I get off the bus and find a CDO and tell him everything.  

Angry CDO, ""You're just paranoid!"" He said something like that, I remember walking away nonplussed.  

So I confided in the other bus riders.  And they all told me that had also happened to them during their watch.  At this point we were really freaked out and told the CDO who in turn said this.  

""I can't wait to get off this watch, all of you shut up, you get off watch in an hour and a half!""  He walked away pissed off.

I remember telling all of them to make sure they don't let anybody on the bus without ID and to never leave the buses.  Also we all agreed to pass down what we had all talked about.  

We finished the last bus ride without incident and upon returning to the ship I saw the CDO talking to another Khaki doing passdown.  I remember he was angry when he saw me I actually felt embarrassed.

The next day they secured liberty and we set out to sea as normal.  I was sitting in the shop telling my shipmates about the crazy bus drivers for a while. 

We were watching CNN when it broke the headlines a few days later that something like 27 people were caught in Singapore in a foiled plot to commit terror while the John C Stennis Battle Group was in port.  All the bus drivers were arrested along with some of the security.  They confiscated maps and explosives.

No one ever came to talk to me.  I never saw any paperwork, I was never talked to or thanked.  I never even got to see the guys I stood watch with and congratulate them cause our crew was so big, I was night check.  We spent another 6-7 months in the gulf dropping bombs in Afghanistan.  It was in the back of my mind what we had did, but I was so busy working I never really had time to talk to anybody else.

Years later I tell my guys when they are on watch to be as paranoid as they want to.  

This is a throw away account, I just wanted people to know it happened.  That even if no one is watching, you gotta do the right thing.

TLDR:  It's in the title.

Now first I do not get how he is a former soldier since he never got past basic. The thing that is pissing me off is that people think this guy was in for a long time and then got kicked out for saying he is gay.

While waiting at the gate for my flight to ****, I noticed a young (aren’t they all!) Marine sergeant, wearing the Corp’s dress uniform.  He cut quite a figure; young, trim and fit, proud.  I figured that he was traveling home for Christmas, perhaps a bit early due to schedules, as so many service people do this time of year.  A moment later I noticed both pilots of our flight speaking with the man, and I was immediately overcome with a sense of anxiety.  Was he escorting a comrade? I almost lost it.

 

The Marine was allowed access to the aircraft before the general public.  On boarding, I saw him seated in the first-class section of the “75.”  It did not bode well.  I almost lost it.

 

Upon completion of the safety briefing, the Captain made his welcoming announcement just after the cabin door was closed.  His comments were followed by an announcement with a request that at the completion of our flight in **** all passengers remain seated as a sign of respect for the Sergeant was indeed accompanying a fallen, fellow Marine.  I almost lost it.

 

During the announcement, a bone-headed, self-absorbed excuse for a citizen of this country, sitting in the center seat in the row in front of me just couldn’t pause his cell phone conversation for even 30-seconds.  Stifling my growing disgust, I had to lean forward to ask him to put the phone down for a few moments to pay attention to the Captain.  Thankfully I didn’t reach forward, yank the phone from his hands and stick it “where the sun don’t shine;” but I was a good boy and only used a stern voice to admonish this loser to chill for just a moment.  Nevertheless…I almost lost it.

 

Exiting the plane in ****, I stopped to ask a flight attendant to thank the captain for me for his respect.  I almost lost it.

 

At the top of the jetway, I realized that it wasn’t just the captain, but the entire crew who were taking care of the escort, so I asked the attending gate agent to thank the entire crew for me.  I almost lost it.

 

In the terminal, at the window by the gate, were 12-15 people standing, looking out and down at the ramp next to our aircraft.  I can only assume that they were family and friends of the fallen soldier, meeting him for the last time.  I almost lost it.

 

These days may seem dark, but we must not let despair prevail.  Take comfort in family, friends and faith.

 

I almost lost it, but the strength I have gained from the above 3 pillars of life sustains me and gives me the confidence to know that we will all come through this trial we call life.

 

Thank you.

 

Merry Christmas.

 

God Bless.

I wanted to share it as a small way of saying thank you to all the military personnel and families out there serving and sacrificing for their country. **There are** still folks out there who know, and very much appreciate, what you guys do.

Subject: MRE DATE (UNCLASSIFIED)

This is long but really funny. It will have you crying.

Ever eat an MRE? You'll love this one. In fact, I think you'll love this
one even if you have to learn what an MRE is. According to the sender, it's
from a Marine gunnery sergeant -- who should know. And this introduction
should let you know the subject matter gets pretty, well, basic.

The MRE Dinner Date

I had a date the other night at my place. On the phone the day before, the
girl asked me to cook her something she's never had before for dinner.
After many minutes of scratching my head over what to make, I finally
settled on something she has DEFINITELY, definitely had never eaten before. 

I got out my trusty case of MRE's. (Meal, Ready-to-Eat) Field rations that
when eaten in their entirety contain 3000+ calories in each meal.

Here's what I made: I took three of the Ham Slices out of their plastic
packets, took out three of the Pork chops, three packets of
Chicken-a-la-king and eight packets of dehydrated butter noodles and some
dehydrated/rehydrated rice. I cooked the Ham Slices and Pork Chops in one
pan, sautéed in shaved garlic and olive oil. In another pot, I blended the
Chicken a-La-King, noodles, and rice together to make a sort of mush that
looked suspiciously like succotash. I added some spices, and blended
everything together in a glass pan that I then cooked in the oven for about
35 minutes at 450 degrees.

When I took it out, it looked like, well, ham slices, pork chops, and a bed
of yellow ""poop"". I covered the tops of the meat in the MRE cheese (kinda
like Velveeta) and added some green sprinkly things from one of my spice
cans (hey, if it has green sprinkly things on it, it looks fancy right?

For dessert, I took four MRE Pound Cakes, mashed'em up, added five packets
of cocoa powder, powdered coffee cream, and some water. I heated it up and
stirred it until it looked like a sort of chunky gelatinous Sh** , and I
sprinkled powdered sugar on top of it.. Voilaanger Pudding.

For alcoholic drinks, I took the rest of my bottle of Military Special Vodka
(yes, they DO make a type of liquor named ""Military Special""...it sells for
$4.35 per fifth at the Class Six) and mixed in four packets of ""Electrolytes
- 1 each - Cherry flavored"" (I swear, the packet says that). It looked like
an eerie Kool-Aid with sparkles in it (that was the electrolytes I guess...
Could've been leftover sand from Egypt). 

I lit two candles, put a vase of wildflowers in the middle, and set the
table with my best set of Ralph Lauren Academy series China (that stuff is
EXPENSIVE... My set of 8 place settings cost me over $600 on sale at the
Lejeune PX), and put the alcoholic drink in a crystal wine decanter.

She came over, and I had some appetizers already made, of MRE
spaghetti-with-meatballs, set in small cups. She saw the dinner, saw the
food, and said ""This looks INCREDIBLE!!!"" We dug in, and she loved the
food. Throughout the meal, she kept asking me how long it took me to make
it, and kept remarking that I obviously knew a thing or two about cooking
fine meals.

She kind of balked at the make-shift ""wine"" I had set out, but after she
tried it I guess she liked it because she drank four glasses during dinner.
At the end of the main course, when I served the dessert, she squealed with
delight at the ""Chocolate mousse"" I had made. Huh? Chocolate what? Okay...
Yeah... Its Chocolate Mousse. Took me HOURS to make... Yup!

Later on, as we were watching a movie, she excused herself to use my rest
room. While she was in there, I heard her say softly to herself ""uh oh"" and
a resounding but petite fart punctuated her utterance of dismay. Let the
games begin. She sprayed about half a can of air freshener (Air Freshener,
1 each, Orange scent. Yup. The military even makes smell-good) and returned
to the couch, this time with an obvious pained look. After 10 more minutes
she excused herself again, and retreated to the bathroom for the second
time, I could hear her say, ""What the hell is WRONG with me???"" as she again
send flatulent shockwaves into the porcelain bowl. This time, they sounded
kinda wet, and I heard the toilet paper roll being employed, and again, LOTS
more air freshener.

Back to the couch. She smiles meekly as she decides to sit on the chair
instead of next to me. She sits on my chair, knees pulled up to her chest,
kind of rocking back and forth slightly. Suddenly, without a word, she
ROCKETED up and FLEW to the bathroom, slammed the door, and didn't come out
for 30 minutes.

I turned the movie up because I didn't want her to hear me laughing so hard
that tears were streaming down my cheeks. She came out with a slightly gray
pallor to her face, and said ""I am SOOOOOO sorry. I have NO idea what is
wrong with me. I am so embarrassed; I can't believe I keep running to your
bathroom!!"" I gave her an Imodium AD, and she finally settled down and
relaxed.

Later on, she asked me again what I had made for dinner, because she had
enjoyed it so much. I calmly took her into the kitchen and showed her all
the used MRE bags and packets in the trash can. After explaining to her that
she had eaten roughly 9,000 calories of ""Marine Corps Field Rations"" she
turned stark white, looked at me incredulously, and said ""I ate 9,000
calories of dehydrated food that was made 3 years ago?"" 

After I admitted it, she grabbed her coat and keys, and took off without a
word. 

She called me yesterday. Seems she couldn't shit for five days, and when she
finally did, the smell was so bad, her roommate could smell it from down the
hall. She also told me she had been working out nonstop to combat the high
caloric intake, and that she never wanted me to cook dinner for her again,
unless she was PERSONALLY present and supervising.

It was a fun date. She laughed about it eventually and said that that was
the first time she'd ever crapped in a guy's house on a date. She'd been so
upset by it she was in tears in the bathroom while I had been in tears on
the couch.",,False,self,t5_2qh8y,False,,,True,t3_13sdcz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/13sdcz/mre_date_night/,

My Email:
Hello, my name is 1LT XXXXXXXXXX, an Infantry Platoon Leader with the US Army deployed to Afghanistan. I called today attempting to resolve an issue I am having with a Collections Agency which claims that I failed to pay a debt which was paid with your Bill Pay service. To resolve the issue on my end, I called to get the address, account number, and any other associated info with the payment, but was told that it would be a ""security issue"" to disclose that info to me via email or over the phone. Despite having knowledge of the account itself, as well as my own SSN, I was told that I could not verify my identity over the phone and could not be given this info. My situation does not permit me, for obvious reasons, to meet your standards of identification, and was forced to have this info sent via USPS to my parents. This will of course not only delay me resolving this issue for another 7-10 business days, but also arises the question of how you will resolve the issues of my Soldiers who may find themselves in similar situations, with no alternate contact. I am very displeased with your accomodations to deployed Soldiers, and I will refrain from doing business with you in the future.

Their Response:
Thank you for contacting Wells Fargo. My name is Ashley, and it is my 
pleasure to assist you today.

I appreciate the time you have taken to provide us with your comments. 
Your concerns are important to us as we strive to better serve our 
customers. I apologize for any inconvenience regarding this matter.

On behalf of Wells Fargo, thank you for your business. We are happy to 
have you as our customer and appreciate the opportunity to assist you 
today.

Sincerely,

To start out some facts: I served in Iraq and was returned to drill status right before the new year. I was in the wonderful city of Mosul and if any of you have been there then you know just how wonderful it was. I served with the army and would proudly do it again any day.
After coming home and returning to drilling status, I had my plans all laid out. The only thing that was missing was ambition. I did what alot of vets did, I sat on the couch and did nothing. Now this is normal for a week or two but then you go out and start doing whatever it is you have to do. The problem was i just never got up. I stopped working out, I stopped talking to friends, and I basically just fell apart. My fiance was starting to get frustrated, more so then while I was gone. There was a  indentation in the couch, friends stopped talking to me out of frustration, and i was putting on weight.
My fiance finally kicked me out of the house one day and said ""Take a walk and don't come back to you have something to do""  At this point i was so depressed i didn't know what to do with myself. I started walking, just wondering really. I spent most of it thinking that i should get help and then coming up with reasons why I shouldn't. I finally looked up and found myself in front of the local SPCA.  I don't know what pulled me in there but i opened the door and walked in. I found myself in front of a dog pen, holding this one year old boxer/lab/pitbull mix. I opened the door and sat down and instantly he was my friend. He brought me his toys and sat in my lap. We played for maybe 3 hours and it was the happiest I'd been in a long time. 4 days later we brought max home. 
Now that we have Max things have turned around. He workouts with me and runs everyday. He follows me everywhere, even to the store. If i sit to long on the couch or on the computer he comes over and will take the controller or slam the computer shut and bring me a toy. Even when i lay awake and cant sleep he comes up and lays next to me and everything just seems that much better. I owe him more then hell ever know. 
Ladies and gentlemen please give it up for Max, my hero and best friend. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/SsdGP)",,False,self,t5_2qh8y,False,,,True,t3_pa0y7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/pa0y7/how_this_dog_saved_me_after_my_deployment/,

1. Infantry: Snake smells them, leaves area. 

2. Airborne: Lands on and kills the snake. 

3. Armor: Runs over snake, laughs, and looks for more snakes. 

4. Aviation: Has Global Positioning Satellite coordinates to snake. Can't find snake. Returns to base for refuel, crew rest and manicure. 

5. Ranger: Plays with snake, then eats it. 

6. Field Artillery: Kills snake with massive Time On Target barrage with three Forward Artillery Brigades in support. Kills several hundred civilians as unavoidable collateral damage. Mission is considered a success and all participants (i.e., cooks, mechanics and clerks) are awarded Silver Stars. 

7. Special Forces: Makes contact with snake, ignores all State Department directives and Theater Commander Rules of Engagement by building rapport with snake and winning its heart and mind. Trains it to kill other snakes. Files enormous travel settlement upon return. 

8. Combat Engineer: Studies snake. Prepares in-depth doctrinal thesis in obscure 5 series Field Manual about how to defeat snake using countermobility assets. Complains that maneuver forces don't understand how to properly conduct doctrinal counter-snake ops. 

9. Navy SEAL: Expends all ammunition and calls for naval gunfire support in failed attempt to kill snake. Snake bites SEAL and retreats to safety. Hollywood makes fantasy film in which SEALS kill Muslim extremist snakes. 

10. Navy: Fires off 50 cruise missiles from various types of ships, kills snake and makes presentation to Senate Appropriations Committee on how Naval forces are the most cost-effective means of anti-snake force projection. 

11. Marine: Kills snake by accident while looking for souvenirs. Local civilians demand removal of all US forces from Area of Operations. 

12. Marine Recon: Follows snake, gets lost. 

13. Combat Controllers: Guides snake elsewhere. 

14. Para-Rescue Jumper: Wounds snake in initial encounter, then works feverishly to save snake's life. 

15. Quartermaster: (NOTICE: Your anti-snake equipment is on backorder.) 

16. C-17 Transport pilot: Receives call for anti-snake equipment, delivers two weeks after due date. 

17. F-15 pilot: Mis-identifies snake as enemy Mil-24 Hind helicopter and engages with missiles. Crew chief paints snake kill on aircraft. 

18. F-16 pilot: Finds snake, drops two CBU-87 cluster bombs, and misses snake target, but get direct hit on Embassy 100 KM East of snake due to weather (Too Hot also Too Cold, Was Clear but too overcast, Too dry with Rain, Unlimited ceiling with low cloud cover etc.) Claims that purchasing multi-million dollar, high-tech snake-killing device will enable it in the future to kill all snakes and achieve a revolution in military affairs. 

19. AH-64 Apache pilot: Unable to locate snake, snakes don't show well on infra-red. Infrared only operable in desert AO's without power lines or SAM's. 

20. UH-60 Blackhawk pilot: Finds snake on fourth pass after snake builds bonfire, pops smoke, lays out VS 17 to mark Landing Zone. Rotor wash blows snake into fire. 

21. B-52 pilot: Pulls ARCLIGHT mission on snake, kills snake and every other living thing within two miles of target. 

22. MinuteMan Missile crew: Lays in target coordinates to snake in 20seconds, but can't receive authorization from National Command Authority to use nuclear weapons. 

23. Intelligence officer: Snake? What snake? Only four of 35 indicators of snake activity are currently active. We assess the potential for snake activity as LOW. 

24. Judge Advocate General (JAG): Snake declines to bite, citing grounds of professional courtesy. 

25. Signal: Tries to communicate with snake...fail repeated attempts. Complains that the snake did not have the correct fill or did not know how to work equipment a child could operate. Signal Officer informs the commander that he could easily communicate with the snake using just his voice. Commander insists that he NEEDS to video-conference with the snake, with real-time streaming positional and logistical data on the snake displayed on video screens to either side. Gives Signal Corps $5 Billion to make this happen. SigO abuses the 2 smart people in the corps to make it happen, while everybody else stands around, bitches, and takes credit. In the end, General Dynamics and several sub-contractors make a few billion dollars, the 2 smart people get out and go to work for them, and the commander gets what he asked for only in fiber-optic based simulations. The snake is forgotten.

Taylor, Dale T., Lieutenant, USCG  
Date of Action: 9 December 2003  
Date of Award: 12 March 2004  
  
Lieutenant TAYLOR is cited for heroism on 9 December 2003 while serving as aircraft commander of HH-65B helicopter CG 6523 during the rescue of two survivors from the S/V JA'DA, located 47 nautical miles south of Key West, Florida. Launching from Naval Air Station Key West, the crew encountered 45-knot winds and 15-foot seas exacerbated by heavy rainsqualls. Lieutenant TAYLOR flew to the last known position of the distressed vessel and located the 27-foot sailboat helplessly adrift and violently pitching and rolling in the heavy seas. Unable to establish communications, the crew delivered a hand-held radio, by which--in broken English--the two survivors revealed they were sinking and pleaded to be rescued from their vessel. Despite numerous hoist attempts, the sailing vessel's instability and rigging precluded any type of basket hoist. Confronted with a sinking boat and no other reasonable rescue alternative, Lieutenant TAYLOR recommended to the survivors to enter the water for rescue basket recovery. After the successful hoist of one survivor, the second survivor's flotation device was swept away by the wind-whipped waves. Overcome by fatigue and unable to climb into the rescue basket or return to the sailing vessel, it was evident this 81-year-old survivor would surely drown in the crashing waves. With no rescue swimmer aboard, Lieutenant TAYLOR determined to rescue the otherwise vanquished survivor, quickly but methodically briefed his crew of his intent to vacate the copilot's seat and to be hoisted into the tumultuous seas. Lieutenant TAYLOR, fighting heavy seas to remain afloat, reached the remaining survivor just as he was going under the surface. Despite jeopardizing his own safety, Lieutenant TAYLOR grabbed the victim and with all his remaining strength, swam to the basket and lifted the exhausted survivor to safety shortly before the survivor would have surely succumbed to the seas. Only after this last survivor was safely aboard the helicopter was Lieutenant TAYLOR hoisted aboard. Lieutenant TAYLOR demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and bravery in spite of imminent personal danger during the rescue of two survivors from the S/V JA'DA. His courage and devotion to duty are most heartily commended and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard.

I'm not discounting their service just talking out what I've seen. 

As a private I was never invited to lunch or dinner by a senior NCO or officer yet I seem to see most females with an E6 or higher. Military baring seems to be relaxed when dealing with superiors. 

From what I've seen the living conditions, even when deployed, seems to be better with a smaller volume of people. All of these have very nice locks and even a NCO can not come into them without announcing themselves.  

It seems there are cases where leaders are afraid to punish or discipline females because of the blowback from a harassment or EO claim. 

Let's be honest, the body weight standards for females are a joke and need to be modified. Physical conditioning is being set below what a woman can do. I understand upper body strength is an issue but I also believe women are capable of much more then they're asked to do. When I was with the 82nd we had females performing at the men's physical standard, both for general PT and rucking. 

I don't believe pregnancy should be a factor in a service members term of service. Becoming a father is a life changing event and we don't allow males to leave because of it. Women are put on light duty and removed from deployment requirements, as they should, but being able to leave the service seems wrong. 

A MUCH lower of risk of seeing actual combat. I believe the average percentage of KIA who are female is around 2%. 

So these are the things coming off the top of my head. I would like to have an honest conversation, with female soldiers if possible, about what I may be missing. I have known women where just as or more hardcore than their male counterpart and I'm not trying to disparage anyones service. I'm simply saying from where I'm standing it would be a better term of service as a female than a man. 

EDIT: NIGHT IN AFGHANISTAN - I would like to thank everyone for the new points of view. Especially the females who spoke of personal experience. It would seem there is still room to improve gender relations in the military and any person, man/woman gay/straight that is unable to perform their job because of these issues have my sympathy. It's been a wonderful conversation that I'll be thinking about this evening. Feel free to continue without me and I'll be asking more questions later.

Three years ago, I wanted to join the Air Force, but weighed too much, and read /r/military to build motivation while dropping about 70 pounds. Then in recruiting I asked you guys questions, and /r/military kept me from making mistakes when it comes to taking ""whatever job"", and helped me build realistic expectations of the process. Then, in DEP for 13 months, I stayed here to discuss DEP, read posts about what to study, and feel connected to a community. Then my AF recruiter screwed me (long story), and I decided to take some more /r/military advice and try for a commission, even if it was reserve instead of active. 


Fast forward to now, and I'm finally shipping next month for BCT, then on to OCS for the Army National Guard.

What I'm saying here is I've been here a lot trying to join.

 I don't know if I could have gotten through this process of joining without you guys' advice, humor, and sense of community. With that in mind, I want to give something back. Reading /r/military I noticed that several questions come up repeatedly, usually focused on eligibility, recruiter, job selection, DEP, and Basic Training. Over the last three years I've been bookmarking threads and sites related to these areas of questions, and I present them here (hopefully formatted correctly) in an easy to reference post that can be linked when others ask these questions. So here goes: the /r/military FAQ.

**GIANT FREAKING DISCLAIMER: Currently, this list only applies to the United States Military.** 

If anyone wants to contribute some stuff for other nations, PM me or comment here and I'll add it.


**Joining the Military**

**Which Branch is right for me? I am a ______________.""**

There are several opinions on this answer, and no one will be able to tell you what is exactly right for you. You should weigh out quality of life, type of work you want to do, and types of deployments. Regarding quality of life, it is generally agreed on this subreddit that Air Force has the highest, followed by the Navy, then Army and Marines. I haven't seen any discussions on life in the coast guard, but comments below may help. 

Regarding deployment, **do not join if you do not want to deploy**. All volunteer military, time of war, etc. etc. However, deployments will have much more to do with your job than your branch. A marine in certain jobs may deploy less than an Air Force combat controller, for example. Please do not think that there is any *safe* branch to join, including the coast guard.

Regarding types of jobs, there are a variety in each branch, but generally speaking the Air Force or Navy have the most technical type jobs, Army and Marines have more combat oriented jobs. There are numerous exceptions to this rule. 

In the last couple of months, the following discussions have been had on this topic.

You may also wish to research each branch's website or about.com's website for each branch, linked below.

[Marines](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/marines/United_States_Marines.htm)

[Coast Guard](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/coastguard/United_States_Coast_Guard.htm)

**I want to join the military, but I'm ________. Can I still join?**

When you've talked to a recruiter and you are sure you want to join, you'll be sent to a facility called MEPS. At MEPS, they will preform a physical, take a medical history, and perform a height and weight check. About.com has a website that can answer most questions about eligibility, including height, weight, age, ""moral standards"", and physical illnesses, etc. It's linked here.

[Eligibility for enlistment](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/joiningthemilitary/a/enlstandards.htm)

**I don't fit the above standards, can I get a waiver?**

Maybe. No one here can tell you for sure, because that changes from day to day, month to month, who you are, what your other qualifications are, and a million little other things. However, waivers are granted, and are granted often. Don't lose hope, work with a recruiter, but have realistic expectations.

** I'm ready to talk to a recruiter, are they lying to me about _______?**

Maybe. Think of recruiters as car salesmen. They will tell you enough truth about the car, and what they say will be true, however, at the end of the day their job is to bring you in. Some advice that's been given here if you want to check on things your recruiter said: do a search here, or of the internet. Call a recruiter in another area of your state and ask them. If both of those things fail, feel free to post here and ask others.

**BASIC TRAINING**

There have been many discussions on basic, whether it be Army, Air Force, Marines, Navy, or Coast Guard. Here's some links on those.

**Army**

[Here's a comment on BCT that has generally been upvoted](http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/h6aaa/leaving_for_bct_in_9_days/c1swehu)

Here's a [blog](http://bankingtobootcamp.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2010-11-22T08%3A08%3A00-06%3A00&amp;max-results=700) that was kept for one person's day to day experience at BCT at Ft Jackson

Each training location also has a website relating to training there. They are

[FORT KNOX has a shitty website, but the packing list is there](http://www.knox.army.mil/information.asp)

[FORT BENNING](https://www.benning.army.mil/basictraining/)

[FORT JACKSON](http://www.jackson.army.mil/sites/bct/)

[FORT LEONARD WOOD](http://www.wood.army.mil/wood_cms/252.shtml)

**AIR FORCE**

Air Force Basic Military Training for enlisted is all done at Lackland Air Force Base in sunny San Antonio Texas. Here's some [advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/id23s/leaving_to_af_in_40_days_looking_for_some_advice/) from here but make sure you check out about.com's excellent guide to Air Force BMT, linked below.

[LACKLAND AFB](http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/airforcejoin/a/afbmt1.htm)

Make it into Air Force OTS? You lucky son of a bitch. Here's some info on [that](http://www.afoats.af.mil/OTS/BOT/index.asp), but if you made OTS you probably don't need someone googling things for you.

**NAVY**

Ah, good old Great Lakes Naval Base. Again, about.com has a guide for [YOU](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/navyjoin/l/aanavybasic1.htm) which does a pretty good job, according to some seamen.

Make navy OCS? [Here's a documentary on that.](http://www.projo.com/extra/2008/ocs/)

**MARINES**

You guys will ship based on where you live. west of Lake Michigan goes to San Diego, east goes to Parris Island. [Parris Island](http://www.mcrdpi.usmc.mil/training/)  and [Marine Corps Recruit Training Depot San Diego](http://www.mcrdsd.usmc.mil/), which is Spanish for ""A whale's vagina"".

Here's a guide to [surviving](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/marinejoin/a/marinebasic.htm) your training, good luck. 

**Coast Guard**

Coast guard does one location for training, [Cape May, NJ](http://www.uscg.mil/hq/capemay/) Here's your [guide
](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/cgjoin/l/aacgbasic1.htm) which should answer many questions.

Hopefully this should answer your frequently asked questions /r/military, and I will happily update this post with anything you guys feel would make it better. This is my gift to you, a link which will reduce the amount of time spent answering these questions again, and again, and again.

Thanks again, seriously, for everything the community has done helping me join over the last couple of years. I've still got six weeks to basic, so I'll update this with more frequently asked questions as they are suggested.

**You guys rock.**

1338522452.0,161,self.Military,uf2xp,The Day I Decided To Kill Myself,cookie-cutter,187,26,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/uf2xp/the_day_i_decided_to_kill_myself/,"In September of 2009 I was a fresh faced and naive specialist on my very first tour of the big, bad Iraq. I was a medic working in a small clinic on the outskirts of downtown Baghdad and was in the most ideal circumstances one could be in during their first deployment. 

Prior to heading out I was a young man from a small town who was chasing an American Dream of sorts. I pictured myself as this glorious super-soldier who aspired to be the Audie Murphy of my generation, this unstoppable and insurmountable force of American military might and the swift hand of Democracy swinging in to ""save the oppressed"". I had gotten engaged to my high school girlfriend of 2 years while I was in Medic School a few months before and we'd planned on a longish engagement so that we could both work our way through college (cute, I know). Then the word came down, ""SPC. Cookie-Cutter your unit is getting deployed, being that you're in college you aren't required to go (I was in the Army National Guard at the time) but if you were so inclined I know they could use an extra set of boots on the ground..."" Well that settled it. They wanted me to go, they NEEDED me to go, they wanted me to act as a force for good and go live out all of those glorious moments I had seen in my head since I was a kid. ""I'm in.""

Flash forward to 7 months in country; I am sitting alone in a dark room, the taste of gun oil in my mouth is sort of relaxing and it gives me something to focus on other than pulling the trigger of the M-9 that the gun oil is coating. A thousand thoughts are running through my head and each one seems to last a lifetime. I still have no idea how long I sat in that room. 

I was getting deployed so I did what any young All-American young man would do, I got married. 3 weeks before I shipped out we said our ""I dos"" and that was that. My wife and my mom didn't get along very well and I didn't do a very good job of trying to mediate between the two. My dad and step-mom were sort of hippie types and weren't all that thrilled about my joining the Army and much less so about my volunteering to go into ""an unjust war that is only trying to exercise control over minorities that YOU are helping to fulfill!"" so there wasn't much talking to either side. I deployed and did my job, enjoyed all of the learning I was doing (I had a crack team of medics that had been in for a lot longer than I had and they were always seeking to better me as a medic and as a soldier) and I was enjoying the idea that I was doing something for the greater good. 

The wife and I would email fairly frequently and we had the occasional phone call but the contact became less and less frequent to the point where the only time we were really talking was when she wanted me to transfer money into her account ""for school"" (she was a college student at the time) or ""for gas"" or something like that. I was more than happy to provide for her and did what I saw to be my husbandly duty. When I would ask her to start chatting more frequently she woud say she'd been busy and she was so sorry and then set up a time for a phone call or the rare Skype session and then miss it with claims of how busy she got and restart the whole cycle. This had me fairly down but I threw myself at work and started counting down the days, weeks and months that I had until I went on leave when I could see her and we would all be happy and lovey and unicorn farts (rainbows, BTW). 

Then came the day she made one of our phone call appointments. ""I'm not happy, I don't love you, I want a divorce. I am going to get a lawyer tomorrow and will have the papers to you soon but I need you to send $2,500 to pay for it."" I was in total shock (I shouldn't have been but I was rather dumb at the time) and couldn't do anything more than stutter and say ""Uh...okay."" I didn't tell any of my unit what happened, I couldn't, I didn't know how. I was this young ""hot shot"" that was the ideal soldier, young, tough, hardcore and bullet proof. I worked through my shift, went back to my quarters and then let everything hit me. I chambered a round and placed the barrel of the gun into my mouth.

Like I said, time slows down in these situations. I let everything replay and I let everything fall into place, the distance, the missing the phone calls, all of it. She was cheating on me (later confirmed) and I was powerless to do anything. I wasn't angry, I was just sad. I had failed to be a good husband and had no one close to me to talk to about it. I was alone, 9000 miles from home, in a dark room, ""depressed"" and with a loaded gun in my mouth. A bad combination to say the least. 

I've learned that the most dangerous thing in the world is a kid with a gun but I never realized this is true in cases of potential suicide. I almost did it, I heard the click of the weapon going into a half-cock and suddenly something sprang into my mind (not a bullet), a limerick:

There once was this kid in Iraq,
Who got too much sand in his crack.
When Sarge yelled, he ran 
and then friction began
and now he's got burns on his back.

Not very funny but it had me in stitches. I had to share this silly thing I created with someone, with EVERYone in fact. I was at a fairly small post and spent the next few hours telling everyone I thought might listen. It got some chuckles here and there and a good number of sighs in between but with every re-telling I would guffaw and applaud my creativity. It was the link in the chain that kept me tethered to not killing myself. It worked. When I returned to my room later that day I had no intentions, no desires and no thoughts of killing myself. I was ready to get home and start all over. 

Point of the story: In my young and seemingly lonely state I allowed myself to almost make some insane decisions. I've since made up with my mom, set aside all differences with my dad and am happily enjoying dating (and NOT looking to get married). If you are ever in a situation that seems bleak and lonely, talk it out. Tell your battle-buddy. Let your Team Leader or Squad Leader or Platoon Leader know. Seek out Combat Stress or Psych Docs. There is always a better way. I got lucky that some shitty bit of rhyme popped into my skull but I am always going to laugh when I hear that because it literally saved my life. To the young soldiers (and there are a helluva lot of those out there) don't be rash. Life is ahead of you, keep going for it.
