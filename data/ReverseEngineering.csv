After looking at the [javascript file](http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2777139) and some traffic files that people have uploaded as they went to the backdoored onion site (such as [this](http://jsunpack.jeek.org/dec/go?report=fcb1f83ffd0f27bd9db52459f1a445f4688d15c6) and [this](http://jsunpack.jeek.org/dec/go?report=d68f00b4a5a4a21c6caf9c88b231a195a24204e0)), I quickly threw that into IDA to get a basic idea of what it is doing.  ~~I've pasted it [here](http://pastebin.com/BNqMk5qy).~~ 

* /u/moyix [has posted a better annotated IDA output file that he found](http://pastebin.com/fjkEnfgD).  Functions used by shellcode (so far in the analysis) include

* /u/Borgbox has posted the Mozilla [bug report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=901365) for this vulnerability.  So far it looks like it was targeted at Windows but can possibly affect Linux hosts as well.

EDIT: So far it looks like most basic shellcode, just grabbing the PE header (fs:[30]) and probably also finding locations of dependencies (I see a hashing function for that)

If you have any articles/web-pages that could explain the basics, like what tools to use, methods etc. please do post them. 

Edit: 

I'll start making a list of things I find and if anyone would like to add.

[What is reverse engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering) - Wikipedia article

[Introduction to Reverse Engineering Software](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/sigmil/RevEng/) - An introductory online book on reverse engineering which is very helpful according to [Accuria](http://www.reddit.com/user/Accuria) who PM:ed it to me.


**Tools:**
===========

[The Collaborative RCE Tool Library](http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/tools/index.php/Category:RCE_Tools)

[Disassemblers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler)
--------------

- [IDA Pro](http://www.hex-rays.com/idapro/idadownfreeware.htm) - The Interactive Disassembler. It's used to reverse engineer executables and according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_pro) there is a plugin which can decompile c/c++ executables. This is the free version. I'm not really sure which features are missing or if they are important. Probably depends on what you want to do.


- [SwfScan](http://tools.securitytube.net/index.php?title=SwfScan)

- [Jad](http://www.varaneckas.com/jad) - Java decompiler

- [JD-Gui](http://www.varaneckas.com/jad) - Java decompiler

- [Uncle Hextor Hex Editor](http://www.weirdkid.com/products/unclehextor/)

- [Woodmans Reverse Engineering Tools](http://www.woodmann.com/crackz/Tools.htm) (Are they old? Feedback on these appreciated)

**Programming Languages:**
============

- [Assembly Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) - A [low level language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language). Not really sure when it's appropriate to use but it's vital when you are reversing software. Unless you find a really good decompiler, which i doubt exists. Here is a [tutorial](http://www.securitytube.net/video/208). It's for hackers so how could it be bad ;p

Zero owned and paid to host the site, that can't be argued. But the site itself was all user donations. We crafted the crackmes. We polished the solutions. We moderated the queue.

I feel bad his site is facing viruses or legal trouble or whatever. But its been 8 months, and I feel that holding the community in this stand-still is wrong. I've made numerous requests for a simple tarball of all the crackmes so that a proper mirror could be made until crackmes.de gets back up, but every reply amounts to an evasive ""no"".

If you agree, please send a kind email to Zero (Dr. Thorsten Schneider) making your case. Maybe if he just knows that many are waiting, it will spur him to yield our material. If you see it differently, or there's a perspective I'm missing, then let me know; I'm open to opposing viewpoints here.

Crackmes.de slogan was the ""Reversers' playground"", but Zero has taken everyone's toys and gone home.

    geohot: then i create a virtual segment with the htab overlapping that piece of memory i have
    geohot: write an entry into the virtual segment htab allowing r/w to the main segment htab
    geohot: switch to virtual segment
    geohot: write to main segment htab a r/w mapping of itself
    geohot: switch back

For example, I read that VAC3 would be able to detect illegitimate DLLs even if they were unlinked from the module list. How does it do that? 

QueryVirtualMemory is an obvious method, but those results can be spoofed easily. Would it actually be feasible for the game to step through it's whole 32 bit address space and touching every 4kb page?

It pisses me off when I cannot grasp something so I've decided to devote myself to mathematics.

I am going to be teaching myself advanced math and would like recommendations on what to learn from people who are able to understand reversing and security from a mathematical standpoint.  Right now I have refreshed myself on discreet math and basic calculus and will continue with more calculus.  What other topics should I branch out into?

Trying to make sense of an old AGFA xray image format (contains xrays of cats!),nrpe,54,7,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/s7sdl/help_trying_to_make_sense_of_an_old_agfa_xray/,"My girlfriend works at a Vet clinic, and they have an old hospital xray machine, the server runs an old version of solaris with oracle db, and we found a partition containing all of the data files.

These xrays would be much more useful to the vet if he could email them around to specialists, or even put them on USB stick. Currently he has to print them to get them off the machine in any decent resolution.

There is no technical support for this machine, it was installed around the year 2000 in the hospital and came to the vet in the last year or so, with no maintenance contract.


I've had a few attempts now of trying to decode the image formats, and got a little way, but not the full resolution image.

* Each xray taken has several files associated; DBU, MSK, PYR, STS, HIS, IMG, MSK, PRL and RED
* Only three files look like images with any amount of data: IMG, MSK and PYR. The others seem to be metadata.
* The MSK looks like a bit mask, so not too interested in that.
* The IMG is a thumbnail of the full resolution image. It is a plain greyscale bitmap. A basic header with dimensions and 8 bits per pixel.
* The PYR is the unknown format, the full resolution image (it's the biggest filesize!). I can read some of the headers, and have a bit of info on the contents, but couldn't figure it out enough to convert into an actual image.


Here are the source image sets:

* Set 1: http://jebus.geek.nz/xray/AGFA_REDDIT_SET_1.rar (3MB), 'JUPITER' xray files of a cat(omg reddit loves cats!?). ([decoded thumbnail png](http://jebus.geek.nz/xray/JUPITER_0_1.png))
* Set 2: http://jebus.geek.nz/xray/AGFA_REDDIT_SET_2.rar (24MB), Collection of 10 xray sets, take note of the image RINTOUL_SOLO_1(overexposed, entirely white image)


I'm hoping Reddit will be able to help me figure out the format of the PYR's. They don't look compressed, and are almost bitmap, but none of my bits-per-pixel calculations worked out properly.
Sorry for the long post below, I'm just dumping what I've worked out so far, hopefully it's of some use to those playing the game. Thanks for any clues!


---
This is what I know of the **AGFA header**, and it seems to be consistent across multiple xrays and the image files:

* 32 bytes of ascii header format identifier. Always ""AGFA MEDICAL IMAGING #0001"".
* 4 bytes of ascii filetype identifier. Can be ""IMG"", ""PYR"" or ""MSK""
* 4 byte integer, 'unknown_1'
* 4 byte integer, 'unknown_2'. I believe this refers to the number of 'blocks' in the header. PYR has more than IMG.
* 4 byte integer, 'data_content' This is the size in bytes of the data content. Does not include null footer before EOF.
* 4 byte integer, 'width' in pixels
* 4 byte integer, 'height' in pixels


**IMG file format:**

* After the basic header, the content starts at 0x80 and each byte is a greyscale value. This makes it easy to read and write a PNG so I wrote a converter.
* Converter cpp code: http://jebus.geek.nz/xray/img2png.cpp


**PYR file format:**

The PYR header has 3 more 'blocks' in it than the IMG, here is the JUPITER example:

    unknown_1 = 5
    unknown_2 = 5 (header blocks?)
    data_content = 4,479,372
    width = 2040
    height = 2570
    unknown_3 = 274
    unknown_4 = 274
    unknown_5 = 843
    unknown_6 = 3358
    unknown_7 = 3
    unknown_8 = 13
    triplet_1_1 = (pointer)0x42AA2F73 = (int)1118449523
    ??? = (float) ???
    triplet_1_2 = 0x416c34bb = (int)1097610427
    triplet_1_3 = 0x40D92B78 = (int)1087974264
    triplet_2_1 = 0x3F477121 = (int)1061646625
    triplet_2_2 = 0x3F30B659 = (int)1060157017
    triplet_2_3 = 0x3f0a3715 = (int)1057634069
    unknown_9 = 0x4012F1AA = (int)1074983338

I can calculate some values from this:

    width*height = 5,242,800 pixels
    actual_filesize(disk) = 4,479,744
    actual_filesize-pixel_count = 372 = non_data_size
    header_size = 320
    null_footer = 52 bytes
    header_size+null_footer = 372 = non_data_size

In all PYR images of size 2570x2040, data changes at 0x35a0e to a different style. Don't know what this means, yet.

    0x140 to 0x35a0e = 219,342 bytes (style 1)
    0x35a0e to 0x445acc = 4,260,030 bytes (style 2)		
    style1 and style2 are multiple of 16, minus 2 bytes.
    style1 seems to be 16 bit aligned

PYR files of pixel size 2570x2040 are 4375KB, but 2040x2570 are 4262KB. Same pixel count, different data size.

1356125495.0,38,self.ReverseEngineering,158xy8,Rdis: A binary analysis tool for linux,rednovae,51,13,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/158xy8/rdis_a_binary_analysis_tool_for_linux/,"Hello r/re. Long time lurker, first time poster.

I just GPLed a project of mine I've been working on for a while now named rdis. This is a binary analysis tool for linux. It is in a semi-form of completion, but I have used it successfully for disassembly tasks and believe it provides utility in its current form.

[Website](http://rainbowsandpwnies.com/rdis/) - [Screenshot](http://rainbowsandpwnies.com/rdis/ss18nov2012.png) - [Github](https://github.com/endeav0r/rdis)

Rdis does not *currently* debug executables. I'll comment more on that if there's interest.

While rdis currently supports ELF/PE 32/64-bit x86, you can write custom loaders in lua that provide most of the functionality available from the C loader. An example is available here: http://rednovae.blogspot.com/2012/11/writing-custom-loader-for-rdis.html . Of course, now that it's GPL you could also write your own loader in C.

Reachable functions (I'm betting someone will ask) are functions which rdis believes are currently reachable. I implemented this after disassembling Go binaries which statically link their standard libraries and provide symbols for each function. Instead of searching through every function in the binary, you can search through just the functions rdis believes are reachable.

*My main goal behind releasing rdis is feedback. Please let me know what you think (post-runtime). Consider it a transaction, code for feedback :). This reddit post is fine for feedback.*

**Other notes:**

* Click on an instruction in the graph and hit semi-colon. You are now typing a comment for that instruction. Return ends the comment input.

* Click on a node/vertex in the graph. Hit 'p'. Predecessor nodes/vertices are highlighted.

* The first window you are looking at when running rdis accepts lua. Incomplete lua documentation available [here](http://rainbowsandpwnies.com/rdis/lua.html) . Rdis will look for and run ~/.rdis.lua each time you load an executable.

* You won't be able to save executable loaded with a lua loader. This will have to wait until I find a way to package the lua code used to load the executable in with the saved rdis state.

* Rdis saves its state in JSON, so you can pull information out of the json with your own tools. The json is a bit funky and mirrors rdis' object/container model; However, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out. You'll probably want to compress your saved rdis files.

* From the hex view, right click a byte and select, ""User Function,"" to tell rdis to recursively disassemble from that byte. This is also available from instructions in the graph.

* Call graphs for functions are available from the menu on right clicking a function in the function view.

* References are built at runtime by map/reducing over the graphs holding instructions. c: is for constant, s: is for store, l: is for load. The IL (see src/rdil) isn't complete yet, so this information is only complete for the independent instruction in which the address was found.

* Rdis is threaded. Your cores will help. It also makes healthy use of memory. The beefier your machine, the happier you will be.

*I've added some basic documentation to the rdis site which covers most of the details above: http://rainbowsandpwnies.com/rdis/docs.html*",,False,,t5_2qmd0,1356625240.0,,,True,t3_158xy8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/158xy8/rdis_a_binary_analysis_tool_for_linux/,

I need you to help train more people like yourself.

More likely than not you're ""self-taught"". Except, when you were teaching yourself you were probably actually relying in large part on the help of others. They freely posted zines, articles, and blog entries. They and answered questions in forums, email lists, and in person. Eventually, once you were confident enough to believe you would be right more often than wrong, you might have tried to pay it forward and share your knowledge back to others.

If so, you're the type of person who is needed. We need people who want to make an impact by more rapidly helping educate those who want to learn. We all know that things like certifications and most college curriculums set a fairly low bar for the expectation of what people should know for security. Certainly in the area of reverse engineering there is almost nothing. Paid training classes can be good, but the cost can prevent people from getting all the training they really need.

I believe what's needed are many more people teaching trainings in person, while encouraging their top students to eventually also become instructors. This brings down costs, provides a well-structured learning environment with instant feedback, and results in the education of many more people. If you're a person who already knows the material, becoming an instructor should be a snap. All you need are class materials, and a venue. Finding venues is up to the instructors, but now there is a place that lesson plans and class materials can be stored:

www.OpenSecurityTraining.info

This site is meant to act as a repository for class material that have been used in computer security classes at least a day long. The material must be released under an open license to allow the most possible instructors to utilize and adapt the material. It can then be used by new instructors as-is, or piecemeal to enhance or speed the creation of other classes. I didn't want to widely promote the site until we had enough seed content, and now I think we're there.

But we need more content, and more instructors. If you have classes on any security subject that you currently or have previously taught, and you would like others to use the material, please consider contributing it. And if you're one of the people who already knows a great deal of the material currently posted there, please start thinking about how you could take the material and start teaching others in person, at your job, at conferences, or elsewhere. For more about why you should contribute, and why you should teach, please read this page: www.OpenSecurityTraining.info/Why.html

Thanks

I'm currently studying Computer Science and I've always known about debugging (but on a simple level).
I've been reading a lot about reverse engineering lately because I know almost nothing about software protection schemes and would like to know how they work, how to build my own (etc) and how to defeat them.
After doing research (even if small amounts), I haven't been able to find many resources that are modern (except for a few books which I plan to get). I realize assembly language is the standard, and I'm attempting to understand as much of it as I can, but would like to know if any of you have suggestions or resources I should check out in order to get into this field.

The only tutorials I can find online are extremely old and un-helpful, things like ""Open the exe file in IDA and search for the string blablabla, and then just change it!"" or things that haven't worked since the 90s.

Because of the fact that I can't find any college classes on this or anything else like that, I haven't been able to find a place to learn Reverse Engineering. Would anyone here be able to help me?

For example, these days there are often high-profile exposés in venues such as the New York Times about state-sponsored malware; sometimes a member of the security community has his or her (who am I kidding, his) research detailed in mainstream media sources; our industry might be the subject of political discussions, e.g. whether exploit sales should be regulated; and so on.  I hesitate to post these articles to /r/ReverseEngineering due to my desire to maintain the technical focus of that subreddit, but at the same time I feel as though subjects like these may be interesting to readers of /r/ReverseEngineering.

Therefore, the solution to this problem is to create a new subreddit specifically devoted to the ""non-technical"" side of reverse engineering.  Hence I introduce [/r/RELounge](http://www.reddit.com/r/RELounge).  The charter for this subreddit is fairly nebulous.  If it's in the mainstream media, post it to RELounge.  If it's ""technical"", but does not involve assembly language, low-level system programming, compiler internals, or mathematics (for example, writeups from the anti-virus industry which don't involve any binary analysis), post it to /r/RELounge.

For people who like to read /r/ReverseEngineering in either ""[new](http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/new)"" mode (i.e., only seeing the most recent submissions) or ""[comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments)"" mode (i.e., viewing only the most recent comments), you can continue doing this for both subreddits at the same time with these combined [new](http://www.reddit.com/r/RELounge+ReverseEngineering/new) and [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/RELounge+ReverseEngineering/comments) links.

Thanks for your attention and I hope /r/RELounge can become as worthwhile a destination as /r/ReverseEngineering.

The binary takes one argument and reads data from STDIN.
here is a commented version.

     0x00000000    cmp    sp,0xb139   ; ? why this compare
     0x00000004    jb     0x0000004a  ; jump below to exit 
     0x00000006    mov    bp,0x5d     ; ? why move bp after code segment
     0x00000009    mov    dx,0x152    ; buffer address for data
     0x0000000C    mov    cx,0xad39   ; max read length = 0xad39
     0x0000000F    xor    bx,bx       ; read from STDIN

      ...           ...    ...
     0x00000051    ret

later in the code, they make `lods` and `stos` from `dx (0x00000152)`.
`bp` is used like this in calculations `WORD PTR [bp+0x0]`.

**Please correct my following assumptions:**

 * The `cmp sp,0xb139` is like a check if it's a compatible DOS version or something like that?

 * I assume that DOS loads the binary and places the *command line arguments* behind the code segment? Maybe at `0x00000052` is `argc` and beginning with `0x0000005d` is `argv[]`?

 * I assume that DOS makes a data segment available for the code at `0x00000152` which can be used to read and write data.

 * This is an instruction in the code `lods ax,WORD PTR ds:[si]` (`si == dx == 0x00000152`). Let's assume it reads the arguments and at `dx` is the string ""ABCD"" located. `ax` should be `0x4142` afterwards, right?

Thanks for any help and information about DOS stuff :) I am happy with any URL, paper, ... what could help me :)

I thought CreateRemoteThread() works pretty much all the time, but it simply doesn't. The simplest test case is packing notepad with UPX and then trying to inject a DLL after calling CreateProcess(""notepad"",CREATE_SUSPENDED). You always end up with a zombie process, no matter what.

What I'm exactly trying to do is injecting a DLL in a hooked CreateProcess function. I know Detours offers CreateProcessWithDll, but I don't want to use Detours. For once, I hate the detoured.dll marker and I'm sure patching it out isn't trivial at all.

So I'm stuck with homemade solutions. Googling suggested using WaitForInputIdle() for GUI processes to make it work, but in the end even this didn't launch an UPXed notepad.

My current approach: CreateProcess(CREATE_SUSPENDED), retrieving the OEP, overwriting it with EB FE (infinite loop) so I can let the process run and let Windows do its thing with initialization. After a small timeout, I suspend the main thread, inject my DLL, restore the OEP and call ResumeThread. In theory this works, but for one reason or another, UPX-notepad wins again.

Any ideas?

Edit: I feel stupid, but I made a mistake and now that it's corrected, the EB FE injection technique actually works. I run the target suspended, find out the OEP, write EB FE and let it run. This enables Windows to do its initialization. A generous Sleep(1000) later, the process should be looping as fast as it can. I then inject a LoadLibrary into the running process, suspend the thread, restore the OEP, call FlushInstructionCase() on it so there are no cache-related errors and then I resume the thread, unless the caller requested a suspended thread.

[Script to derive the WPA key for a Thomson/SpeedTouch router from its SSID](http://www.korokithakis.net/node/107)

--------

So, I have a router that includes telephony using SIP. The router connects to my phone company and converts my normal phone to a SIP phone.

The thing is, my mobile phone supports SIP over wifi as well and I would like to use it as a cordless phone when I'm home, but the company won't give me the SIP password or the password to the router, even though I bought it, so I am trying to reverse-engineer it.

The router is a Thomson TG782 (a.k.a. SpeedTouch). It uses some sort of encryption to encrypt my password with the router's serial number. I guess I could reset the router, log in as admin, replace the config with the encrypted password and read the decrypted one on the web interface, but it is too much of a hassle and I would not have internet access or phone during that period. Can anyone help me with the decryption?

I tried getting the router to encrypt some strings just to test, and this is what I got (the table is crypttext: ""plaintext""):

    C45B052831543A08 ""5""
    C2A118E2B5C4B516 ""55""
    4240563093758E0A ""555""
    84A52E4E314D35B9 ""5555""
    CE74F5ABBD788355 ""55555""
    646CFB9FB705CCC1 ""555555""
    0AD7529A3F317E1A ""5555555""
    3ECBA425474E3AFC ""55555555""
    3ECBA425474E3AFCC45B052831543A08 ""555555555""
    3ECBA425474E3AFCC2A118E2B5C4B516 ""5555555555""

I know this isn't XOR, but it doesn't look like AES either... Any ideas?

**EDIT:** Well, I just had the bright idea to use the telnet interface (where I've been dumping the encrypted config from all these days) to set the dyndns hash to the SIP hash and just see it decrypted in the HTML. It worked, I have the password. Why didn't I think of this earlier? :/ It would be nice to have a general way to decrypt all Thomson routers' passwords given the serial, but I can't find anything about the encryption algorithm...",,False,,t5_2qmd0,True,,,True,t3_algth,http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/algth/i_have_a_small_challenge_for_you_guys_if_youre_up/,

In that capacity we need someone to help us build our anti-cheat platform. Someone dedicated to writing the client-side and server side portions of anti-cheat. Preferably a senior windows programmer. The client scans memory and protects files and reports violations to the server. The server tracks those violations, elevates them to customer support and is also responsible for verifying the integrity of the client application and auto-updating that on a regular basis. We need a low level windows programmer with a passion for games.

What's great is that these devices are super simple; just a coil and a resistor that go to the iPhone's microphone line. The movement of the credit card induces a current in the coil, which gets picked up by the iPhone.

Now, my Macbook uses the same microphone setup, so I was able to record the credit card swipe onto my computer. Looking at the waveform, it's easy to see the binary data. I wrote some sweet code that automatically detects the ""bitrate"" (which can change depending on swipe speed) and converts the audio data to binary, as well as some other nifty stuff. As far as I can tell, my code works very well. The results correspond with what I see in audacity. There is only minimal error in between swipes (which would probably be fixed by error checking algorithms in a real reader, or maybe more complex sampling algorithms)

Even when I swipe different cards and do a visual diff of the results, I can see that there are big sections of data that look exactly the same.

What I noticed was that the similarities in the data from different cards occur in multiples of 7 bits. This leads me to believe that I am reading track 1 of the card, which uses the DEC SIXBIT + odd parity format. However, the 7-bit samples I'm picking up don't seem to be of a consistent parity; some are even, some are odd. Track 1 is supposed to be odd parity. I tried shifting all 7-bit values by 1-6 bits (in case I dropped some bits somewhere), but this still didn't make it proper parity.

I also tried searching for individual letters (from my name), but I could not find some of them, and none of them in order. Again, I also tried shifting all 7-bit values. Also tried flipping byte order, polarity, etc. but with no success.

So, TL;DR

**I think I'm getting accurate binary data from a credit card, but it doesn't seem to match up to what wikipedia says should be there.**

Anyone have any advice or experience?

Also, I'm not trying to be a credit card skimmer or anything; If I wanted to, I already have working card reader equipment. This is just an attempt to make a very cheap POS platform on a normal computer or a raspberry pi or something.

**EDIT: Looks like the square readers might have recently been given built-in encryption hardware. Thanks for the tip torvold. I will take a look into that.**
It looks like there is some juicy microcontroller business going on in the Square readers now, which explains why my received data is not at all what I expected. 

The encryption being used doesn't seem to be very strong (extremely low or no cascade effect, very small sub-byte repetition, and low entropy of approx. 5.5 bits per byte). This is turning out more interesting than I thought. 

**EDIT 2/3: I am making some good headway with the audio port protocol. I've figured out the encoding scheme, and have figured out how to get good old 8-bit byte data from it. I have some theories to test, but it does look like the credit card data is encrypted, with what may be a randomly generated password. Every time I swipe the card there are a few small sections of data and one big section of data that is different. There are also a few sections that stay the same for any given card, so I know I'm reading it correctly. Anyway, it looks like some card details are sent cleartext, some encrypted. Figuring out the encryption is on the todo list.**",,False,,t5_2qmd0,1347401480.0,,,True,t3_zkzae,http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/zkzae/help_parsing_raw_binary_data_from_magnetic_credit/,

My problem is, there don't seem to be too much papers/articles that help you get started.

Don't get me wrong, there are of course lots and lots of papers/articles that explain how buffer overflows work, how format string vulns work, how to bypass ASLR or maybe DEP etc. The thing is, these are technical details and I've probably read 400 papers on how to overwrite the return address in the numerous exploitation papers/tutorials but this is not what I'm interested in. I've done reverse engineering and understand how BO and the rest of the usual suspects work, but I don't know how to do anything with my knowledge.

Is there anything that might go into detail regarding the actual workflow? I've read others sometimes grep sources for something, or maybe people actually read the whole source, or do people stumble upon most of the vulns by accident? Is there something that might kickstart my own research, maybe some paper/video of another beginner that explains how he found an actual vulnerablity (maybe wrote a fuzzer)?

My try at an analogy: It seems like everyone is teaching me how to build a motorcycle, yet no one thinks about telling me how to race one, but in the end, this is what matters and I'm having a hard time applying all the theoretical things I know.

Maybe someone has some links to hook me up, much appreciated!

Edit: What triggered the post was the recent article about beginner exploitation of MiniShare in this subbredit.

I had to manually set my `vm.mmap_min_addr` to 0 using `sysctl vm.mmap_min_addr=0` and I tried to figure out kernel symbol information using root privileges.

    $ sudo grep prepare_kernel /proc/kallsyms
    c10761f0 T prepare_kernel_cred

    $ sudo grep commit_creds /proc/kallsyms
    c1075f80 T commit_creds

Now I have a couple of questions at this point: -

 1. `rasm2 -a x86 ""call 0xc10761f0""` gives me ""e8eb6107c1"". Why is it not ""e8f06107c1""? The case is similar with the address for commit_creds.
 2. When I wrote the exploit I noted that using ""e8eb6107c1"" always ended up jumping to ""prepare_kernel_cred+5"", on inspecting /var/log/syslog. I adjusted it to ""e8e96107c1"" and it suddenly works! Here I have a couple of doubts, why am I having to adjust the address of `prepare_kernel_cred`? Also, why is it that I dont have to adjust the address of `commit_creds`

I considered asking this at SO but then couldnt find an 'exploit' tag, so thought I'd post here.

We live in Portugal and our town has it's own bus system and they use RFID for the tickets (magnetic tickets were replaced recently).

Our plan is to understand how this system works, what information is stored on each card and how can we hack it for learning purposes.

Right now we're at information gathering stage and we need to learn everything we can before we jump right into it.

**Information about the tickets**

- Rechargeable (if we need more rides they recharge the ticket, we always keep the same one) -&gt; Read/Write?

**What we want**

- Read and decrypt the information (all the ticket content, not just the TAG or what it might be)
- Modify the information on the ticket (add more trips, valuable information the ticket might contain)
- Clone a ticket

**What we need to know**

- How can we detect the ticket frequency?
- How to know the tag (Mifare, ISO 14443, etc..) prior to buying the reader/writer?
- Ignoring the frequency, using a reader can we extract all the content from the ticket with no efforts? (talking about password, encryption, etc...)
- After we got the frequency, is it easier/cheaper to buy a RDIF read/writer or to build an arduino one?

Hope you guys can give me some information, I've already started looking around a lot of websites and I'm doing the best research I can before starting this. Thank you!

As you can see, they're pretty flexible, it's just a piece of paper


------------------------------ **EDIT** ------------------------------

Good news everyone! So we found out that my town's bus system publishes a monthly magazine and in one of them they explain how the system works!

**Protocol:** ISO 14443B

**Frequency:** 13.56MHz

Tag: It might be Calypso............ :(

They have two types of tickets: a personal ticket, which has the name and photo of the person (for regular passengers) and a paper one (the one in the photo) for occasional passengers. Both have the same chip (and antenna) where **client data and transportation contracts are stored.**

**Under the Hood**

* PoS: There are stores across the city where we can acquire and recharge the tickets.

* Inside the bus: there's also a PoS working the same way as the stores. The on board ticketing system connects with the geo location system to acquire data about all the tickets inside that specific bus. The information acquired on board is automatically collected, over WiFi, in the central garage where the buses are stored (possibly at the end of the day) and that information is sent to the central system where all the data is processed (financial, operational, statistics...). Using the same communication method, information about rates, users etc.. is sent to the on-board system.

* Central System: system with high availability (24x7). The database contains all the necessary information for operational, accounting and statistic management. All the data corresponding to the transactions created from all across the ticketing network, are stored in the database where all the information can be analyzed with different purposes like client management, auditing, maintenance management, complaint management and fraud management.

I would greatly appreciate if I (and all others) may query your experiences about this topic. Even a single query is appreciated!

After one has obtained the basics in x86 ASM, familiarity with tools such as [ImmDBG](https://www.immunityinc.com/products-immdbg.shtml)/[WinDBG](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463009.aspx) and some knowledge on types of vulnerabilities,

* *how do you pick your target?*

Reward programs such as [ZDI](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/upcoming/) and [EIP](https://www.exodusintel.com/eip/) are not clearly stating as to what products to aim for. Surely we can deduce a bit from the published advisories, but only very high level.

I see two flavours of targets:

* Browsers and their addons/extensions (such as Flash/Shockwave)
* Others

Especially the latter category is huge. Without any evidence and just based on gut feeling I feel that programs such as MS Word/Excel/PDF readers are targeted by allot of researchers. I'd rather go for some less known products, but 

* *which ones?*
* *Am I seeing monsters under the bed by thinking the odds of submitting a duplicate bug in those big programs is high?*
* *How often did you experience this?* 


**Slightly unrelated to the original question**

Anyone followed one of these courses/workshops and willing to share their experience? What was your entry level knowledge wise? What did you learn/gain most from it?

* [Exodus Intel - Breaking Binary Applications](http://blog.exodusintel.com/2012/12/17/exodus-intelligence-2013-training-courses/)
* [Attack Secure - Ninja Skills](http://attack-secure.com/index.php/ninja-skills/)
* Others?

Just got around to looking at the docs again and it looks like the picoChip baseband processor is based on the ARM 926EJ-S processor, so that has a JTAG.

I've tested the resistance from Vss to various JTAG I/Os and this [photo](http://i.imgur.com/fljbN.jpg) is my guess of the JTAG pins.  The resistance information was based on the presentation by Gerrit van der Bij, ""[The Embedded JTAG interface HOWTO](https://har2009.org/program/attachments/127_JTAG-v2.0.pdf)"" :

&gt; •JTAG only has one output pin.
&gt; 
&gt; –The TDO pin: when JTAG is inactive, the TDO pin should NOT be driven.
&gt; 
&gt; –The resistance of the driver transistors when they are NOT driven is very large (&gt;10MΩ) to both power supply and ground.
&gt; 
&gt; •JTAG has 3 ""interesting"" input pins.
&gt; 
&gt; –To prevent drifting voltages on these pins, they are terminated via a resistor to either ground or the supply voltage. It is a very low resistance compared to that of the output (&lt;10KΩ)

It looks like a PCB pads for a regular 14-pin header socket found on some ARM-based boards.

Gonna get some newer USB JTAG connector to see if this is correct.  The [Segger J-Link EDU](http://www.segger.com/cms/j-link-edu.html) seems cool and is [pretty cheap](http://www.segger-us.com/jlinkjtagemulator.htm), $60.

Will also order a couple [four-wall headers](http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&amp;name=S9186-ND) to solder on the two 14-pin pads.",,False,,t5_2qmd0,False,,,True,t3_dlzh0,http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/dlzh0/i_believe_ive_found_the_jtags_for_att_3g/,

This subreddit needs more contributions.  I'm thankful for everyone who does contribute, but as it stands I submit the vast majority of the entries.  We'd all benefit from multiple perspectives on reverse engineering, not just my crusty cracking/academic one.  There are 2220 subscribers to this subreddit at this moment, so I refuse to believe that none of you out there have a useful link to submit.

Remember to up-vote if you like a submission:  this subreddit is small enough that a single down-vote can doom a submission.  Much of the stuff I submit gets 1-3 upvotes and 1-2 downvotes.

As suggested by sanitybit below, we would have more of a community if people commented more on things.  I'm thinking also about an IRC channel?  Anyone interested?  Let's say EFNet #rereddit?

Amber, if you still read this reddit, contact me somehow.  I've fallen out of touch with you this year and I want to talk to you.

Here's where I am, where to next?",Z3tta,29,5,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1a68vq/so_i_got_a_uart_and_cracked_open_an_arris_wbm760a/,"So, being someone who can't resist picking up $1 embedded devices at yard sales, I came across an [Arris WBM760A](http://www.amazon.com/Arris-WBM760A-Touchstone-DOCSIS-Cable/dp/B006UK3K06).

Two visible screws on the bottom, take them out. Then the foot to the right of the LEDs covers a warranty sticker and another screw, take that out and you're home free.

Once you're in, you'll notice something beautiful. Four pinned headers, in a line, all giving out TTL voltages. I couldn't have done it without the help from [this tutorial over at dev/ttys/0](http://www.devttys0.com/2012/11/reverse-engineering-serial-ports/).

So the pins in order from RJ45 connector to the LEDs are [VCC, Tx, Rx, Gnd].

I hooked up a cheap $9 UART I got off of eBay, and set off to find the baud rate (I just manually guessed with putty), which turned out to be 115200. No parity, 1 stop bit, 8 data bits... seems standard. Anyhow, I logged my putty connection and was excited to get some output: http://pastebin.com/ScQ1YaP6

Now, what I've noticed is that there's a very short window where input is allowed. I hooked my multimeter to the tx line from my UART and noticed that at certain period of the boot cycle, I could type and it would display on putty, and you would see the change in voltage on the multimeter. However, after a point in time the tx line will just stay at a constant 1.625v (This could be off, I forget where I write things). So this lead me to test two.

Test two was the putty-paste test, where I reset the putty console, unplugged the modem, and loaded my clipboard with ""paste!\n"", with the \n not being literal of course. So I plugged in the modem and to my hearts content I right clicked that putty window, pasting input as quick as I could. What I found was input is allowed after 

    line 135: Freeing init memory: 76K

until the ending line.

I tried running processes, I tried things like 

    echo `cat /etc/passwd &gt; /dev/tts/0` &gt;&gt; /etc/scripts/z_arris_check.sh

I've tried, perhaps even crazier. Anyways, this is where I'm at. I wanted to write up my findings, my adventure (this is my first adventure with embedded device RE-ing), and hopefully I can get some feedback or insight where to head next.

I am a CS student, still in University trying to find an academic research project and I am looking for ideas.  I am interested in reverse engineering and program analysis.  I have some basic experience in re and malware analysis.  I am specifically interested in applications of theorem provers, SMT/SAT solvers, symbolic execution and model checkers, so I figured this is a good sub to post in.

Long story short, Company of Heroes 2 had a -dev mode s few patches ago. They removed shortly before release because it because it could be used to hack Steam achievements. Understandable. They promised mod support eventually but who knows when.

I'm the creator of the persistent COH1 mod Europe In Ruins. I'm trying to get started porting it to COH2.  I have no interest in Steam achievements.

I have opened the EXE in Hopper.app and found an Misc_IsDevMode offset that is set to 0.  Changed it to 1 and patched the EXE. But it doesn't seem to do anything. Trying to attach a debugger is caught by the Sega DRM DLL and it's using more sophisticated methods than IsDebuggerPresent.

You can run mods without -dev if you package them.  I've also done this but there is some sort of CRC checks because my changes are read and I can see them in 1v1 skirmish vs AI, but the game abruptly ends around 30s into the match.

Anyway, I'm in over my head and would like help and willing to pay if someone could complete the task.",,False,,t5_2qmd0,False,,,True,t3_1hn6pr,http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1hn6pr/thoughts_of_hiring_someone_skilled_in_re/,

1371086775.0,21,self.ReverseEngineering,1g8kzc,HDD Firmware: Where to Start,Habstinat,26,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1g8kzc/hdd_firmware_where_to_start/,"    
As the owner of a Lemote Yeeloong and an ardent free software supporter, I won't lie: I like [free software](https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), and I want all the software I run to be free. I've done some research on the components of the Yeeloong and, contrary to what most might think, I've discovered that even the Yeeloong isn't completely free, although it's still the closest thing we've got to it as of yet. There are two components which still contain nonfree firmware on the Yeeloong:

0. The embedded controller, and
0. The HDD (320GB SATA).

At least there's a start for the embedded controller, as a project to replace it ([OpenEC](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OpenEC)) already exists and the gNewSense developers are working to port it to the Yeeloong. So let's make this post about HDD firmware.

After asking around a little, I was very suprised to find that not only do *all* HDDs and *all* SSDs require firmware, but also that not a single company has released or leaked their hard drive firmware source code, and not a single person has made any notable attempt to replace their hard drive's firmware with a custom-hacked-up-version of their own firmware. The effects of designing a free software HDD firmware replacement will not only be ethical, though; others have thought of a few pragmatic consequences:

* Prevent problems like [this firmware bug, which essentially bricks your HDD unless you have a serial adapter](http://hackaday.com/2012/07/30/recovering-from-a-seagate-hdd-firmware-bug/) from happening ahead of time
* Make data forensics easier by providing more detailed debug commands

I'm sure there are other practical benefits as well; you can think them up yourself. 

So what I'd like to do is reverse engineer current HDD firmwares to develop a free (as in freedom) replacement firmware for HDDs (and maybe also SSDs). The craziest part: Going into this, I'm so clueless that I don't even know the extent of the ambition in this project.

My question is explained in the title of this post -- Where do I start? Here's a brief description of my technical background so far:

* I own the ""The C Programming Language"" by Kerninghan and Richie (2nd edition) and I've read through and understand the basic core of C, although I haven't gotten into the later more in-depth chapters on pointers and other features yet.  
* I know the basics of GNU/Linux (Debian and Arch-based).
* I once tried to learn MIPS assembly via a Wikibook, but I was only able to grind through so much before getting confused and moving on. I think the book was designed more for those who already know another assembly language.

For those that don't know, the Yeeloong is a MIPS machine, so I don't know how valuable learning x86 assembly would be.

Am I correct in assuming that my first step would be building or buying an [RS232-to-TTL adapter](https://sites.google.com/site/seagatefix/) and testing out sending commands to my hard drive? Does anyone here know any information about the role of firmware on an HDD? What exactly does firmware need to do, and what can it optionally do? I suppose a large part of the job would be downloading, extracting, and decompiling firmware updates from WD's website; what machine language would you suppose they would be written in? Not x86, right? Has anyone had any similar experience and advice to share? 

I'm only a sophomore in highschool, so any pointers would be great. I anticipate myself having a lot of time to work on this throughout the school year; I already have allocated a lot of my schedule next year to an independent study, and the more I think about it the more I'd like to spend it working on this. 

Here are some random statistics on the HDD in the Yeeloong, if they're needed:

I also apologize for the formatting; I haven't figured out how to paste blocks of fixed-width font...

I have a basic Hello World program in C (./hello), and I'm trying to add a section of code to it. My goal is to add code that will execute before the original program does.

I'm using objcopy to do this - first, I wrote assembly instructions (jump.s) to represent my added code (currently just a jump to 0x8048000), and assembled this with gcc -c jump.s. I then called 

    objcopy --add-section mysection=jump.o --set-section-flags mysection=alloc,code --change-section-address mysection=0xXXXXXXXX

where XXXXXXXX represents the largest address I see if I run ""readelf -S hello"" plus the size of that section (so the last section that has a nonzero value in the Addr field).

Unfortunately, if I change the entry point of the program to the beginning of mysection, the code that's there is not at all what it should be, even though if I look at it under gdb before running it, the proper instructions are there. Thus, something is happening before jumping to the entry point that overwrites the memory in that location.

Unfortunately, the only documentation I've been able to find of objcopy is a list of the command-line options (which are rather unclear to someone of my experience level), and I feel like I just have no idea what's going on anymore.

I slowly started programming and reverse engineering on my own time about five years ago and I have learned that I have a true passion for these activities. However, even though I love programming, my true love is for reverse engineering. When I want to grow up, I want to be a reverse engineer.

The problem is that I have no idea how to get myself into that industry. Unlike programming in which programmers are literally everywhere, reverse engineers are rare. I have never met anybody who has interest in low-level code such as assembly, let alone a reverse engineer. I have searched for reverse engineering job applications and internships, but as you can imagine, these applications are rare and have high requirements. I simply do not know how to find an internship or entry-level job that can give me experience with reverse engineering.

Another problem is that I am not sure how to display my reverse engineering abilities. I have had a couple of programming jobs in the past and while I am sure that experience will help me find any type of job, I do not feel like it is enough to show employers that I am a competent reverse engineer. Most of the things I have reverse engineered include games, anti-cheats, a few viruses, a few applications, and a few crackmes. Apart from reverse engineering viruses, I do not believe any of the things that I have reverse engineered can be looked at as professional because my activities can be viewed as immoral or even illegal. Everything I have reverse engineered was primarily to learn and to practice something I enjoy doing, but also because I wanted to hack/crack an application or because I wanted to satisfy my curiosity. If programmers want to have something truly professional on their resume, they can always contribute to open source or start a project that can help people. I was wondering if there was something similar that a reverse engineer could do.

I was wondering if a professional within the industry could give a young reverse engineer some advice. Thanks for reading,

Since code analysis helps developers to detect buffer overflows, stack overflows and other similar defects, an intruder can also do such things. By studying weak points of software, a hacker can choose an object for attack faster. That is, he does not need to review a huge amount of code - a static analyzer will do a part of work for him. It will tell him where the code is especially vulnerable so that the hacker may go on to the next stage of his work, i.e. estimating if he can use the code defects found for his purposes and how.

It seems to me, many of the errors, described in these articles are vulnerable:

The positions require some reverse engineering skills.  That makes /r/reverseengineering a good place to search for candidates.

We're a small consulting company based in Baltimore, MD.  Moving to Baltimore is supposed to be required, but you never know.  If you only know Baltimore from ""The Wire"", don't discount it yet.  Send me an e-mail if your only hold-up is Baltimore.

The job is quite diverse.  Over the last year, this group has done a handful of binary DRM audits for consumer devices, a few desktop binary audits, some binary mobile application audits, a few source audits (C/C++/C#/Python) and 2 web app audits.  The ability to get into and understand an unknown codebase quickly is useful.  We also do some vulnerability discovery stuff, if you're into that.  The company was started by a Johns Hopkins professor and his students, so there is a focus on research and learning -- you will have some time each week to dedicate to research and publishing your work is encouraged.  A large majority of the jobs we get are interesting enough and weird enough to hold my fleeting attention.          

Feel free to send me an e-mail and we can discuss ISE further:
dion@securityevaluators.com
I'll also respond to comments on this thread.     

Much of the work we've done recently has been ""embedded"".  Lots of ARM, but we've done MIPS, SH4, and other weirder things in the past.  As an excuse to learn more about the Atari 2600, I created a crack-me to help you figure out if you'd like the kind of work we do.  It also lets you work on something that isn't locked into your preferred platform (unless you're some kind of weirdo).

The challenge can be found here:
http://pastebin.com/CtPKn9bp

NOTE: This little challenge isn't a required part of the application process to ISE.  I just wanted an excuse to spend my research hours playing with a video game system :)  Additionally, if you like the crack-me, then you should like the job.

Ops, I assume job postings are alright.  If not, no hard feelings when you delete the thread.

I set a conditional logging breakpoint on the function I believe is responsible for printing the chat text on the screen. I noticed some extraordinarily strange behavior regarding its parameters.

Sometimes, when the username or message of the speaker are short strings, pointers to the strings themselves are passed to the function. So the stack appears to be something like 

    RETN to Address
    UNICODE ""User""
    UNICODE ""Test""
    ...

So far so good. Except that I noticed that sometimes I didn't get this parameter format. Other times it looks like this...

    RETN to address
    0xAABBCCDD ; pointer to some memory structure
    0xEEFFGGHH ; pointer to some other memory structure

Yeah, just some totally arbitrary pointers. Except that I investigated more closely, and following those pointers gives me a structure that's about 0x30 bytes in size (IIRC), the first four bytes of which is typically a pointer to the unicode string, or just some garbage bytes. About +0x24 into the structure is a DWORD that has the string length, and zero is a valid value for it (which is why that pointer can have garbage in it I guess). I am pretty certain that this structure is a C++ STL string (it's using the MSVR100 runtime). 

So here's the question:

Why does this function receive C-style strings when the strings are &lt;8 characters long, and otherwise receive pointers to structures that represent strings (probably STL)?

Is this an optimization in the MS runtime? I guess a 7 character + one null character string would take up exactly 16 bytes, and anything longer than that seems to be shoved into this weird string structure. Maybe it reallocates things from heap memory into larger pages after a certain size? It's confusing because I don't understand how the code can tell when it has received one parameter type over the other.",,False,,t5_2qmd0,False,,,True,t3_13e7zm,http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/13e7zm/why_do_my_strings_look_like_strings_and_not_like/,

We are a fully-funded startup building a web-based service for analyzing and searching code. You will be in charge of building a large, distributed computing system for parsing and indexing code for our search engine. We've been creating the code analysis tools for existing customers, and we need you to build the automation framework to help us scale.

This is not yet another project to mine social networks to create ads! Some of the capabilities you will implement are:

* Nearest-neighbor search in high dimension (or knowing how to avoid this by projecting to a lower dimension)
* Classifying code by various metrics
* Map/reduce deconstruction of complex queries
* Distributed computing design, cluster management, software deployment, load balancing 

**Requirements**

Exceptional at:

* Python or Ruby
* C/C++
* Unix programming (Linux and/or FreeBSD)
* Working independently to solve problems, manage time, and be self-motivated 

Good working understanding of:

* MySQL or PostgreSQL
* Key/value stores, especially Riak and Redis
* Cluster management and Unix admin (Fabric and Chef)
* Compilers, linkers, and language toolchain internals in general 

Strong interest in:

* Low-level computing (assembly language, linkers/loaders, compiler optimizer design, intermediate languages)
* Using the right algorithm and implementation for the right problem. Knowing how to do profiling and basic statistics to make that choice.
* Machine learning: clustering, classification (locality-sensitive hashing, SVMs)
* Distributed systems and fault-tolerant computing (BigTable, GFS, Dynamo, and similar designs)
* At least one assembly language (x86 preferred)

We're only interested in people who produce working code and deploy it. This is not a research position involving modeling and R. We're a fast-paced company -- if you run into a problem, it's often best to come up with a heuristic and continue around it. You don't have to implement program analysis tools yourself, but you'll be building tools in Python and C/C++ that analyze the data we've extracted from the code.

Interested? Email a resume and links to code you've written to engineer-job@rootlabs.com

I was wondering if anyone on here has done any hardware reverse engineering and would have any advice where to start or if they know of anywhere I could learn how to do it, hardware/software I should have, easy devices to start on, tutorials, anything would be amazing.

I've been dabbling with many things and tools but somethng spark my interest in RE again.

So my question is, would it be possible to get good at REing without being good at programming? I can put together some basic scrips and I am still learning more but the thing is, I have more of analytical mind. I like to analyze data, research, and put the puzzle together. I don't know a lot about REing but it seems like I am more inclined towards braking things and messing with existing code base rather than making something on my own from scratch. I have more difficulties starting a project or writting a paper, I could spend hours on the way I want to express my idea and how to present it but I am pretty quick on extracting data, understanding underlying concepts and etc. Would it be safe to say that maybe RE, malware analyst, pentest, etc. would be a better fit for me? Any of you guys who are not stellar programmers doing RE work for a living? I am not afraid of some C code or whatever, I'd just rather not write it. If I do need to write something, I prefer high level language like Ruby/Python and libraries.",,False,,t5_2qmd0,False,,,True,t3_1i1hjx,http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1i1hjx/is_it_possible_to_become_good_at_re_without_being/,

So i just finished writing a sample ida processor module for a small VM. I have implemented all the parts(ins,reg,ana,emu,out) and successfully build the .ilx. However, I cant get IDA to display my module in the processor drop down menu. Reading the IDA Pro Book, Eagle says that IDA needs a description string within the module to be able to load the processor module. A utility is supplied with the IDA SDK(I am using 6.2), called mkidp.exe which is supposed to insert this description string within the PE header of the module. Yeah, PE. But I just built an ELF module. How else do I get IDA to recognize my module? TLDR; First time IDA(6.2) proc mod writer in Linux, cant get IDA to recognize module in dropdown, What am I doing wrong?
