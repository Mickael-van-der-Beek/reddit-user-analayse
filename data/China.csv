1360318513.0,364,self.China,184ifa,So You’re Going to Your Girlfriend’s Hometown for Chinese New Year:  Thoughts on Making the Best of It,mjwd,419,55,153,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/184ifa/so_youre_going_to_your_girlfriends_hometown_for/,"Having a long-term relationship with a Chinese woman can have its challenges.  You’ll often wonder what language you should speak together, whether or not you should hold hands in public, and why she hasn’t uploaded any pictures of you to her social media profiles.  Those were the easy parts.

When you step through the front door of her relative's house down in the provinces, you will be warmly welcomed.  Introduce yourself in Chinese.  Everyone will be amazed, and then they will ask your girlfriend if you can speak Chinese.  It will take awhile before they ask you any questions directly.  Your answers will probably have to be re-stated word-for-word by your girlfriend before they understand.  At some point during the introductions one of her uncles will say the transliterated version of Hello, “Hā luó!”  Laugh, and tell him his pronunciation is perfect.

You will be offered something to eat and a glass of boiling water with loose tea leaves.  Tell them you already ate, and put the glass on the table before your skin melts off.  You will now go through an endless barrage of questions about your home country.  If you are British, all of the questions will start with “Nǐmen Yīngguó…”.  All of your responses should start with the phrase “Wǒmen Yīngguó…”.

You will be asked if Spring Festival is celebrated in your home country.  Saying that the West stopped using the lunar calendar in the 16th Century might sound like a criticism of China’s 5,000 years of continuous development, so just say you celebrate Christmas.  Chinese people are interested in organized religion, but China as a whole has never really gotten on the bandwagon.  Purgatory must be crowded.

Hopefully you brought unique gifts from your home country, such as food items.  Anything bought in China will not be considered expensive enough for their liking.  There is no modesty in China, so try to avoid letting them see that you have a Nokia brick, not an iPhone.  Do not mention that you flew on Spring Airlines.  You should probably throw the airline luggage tags away before you get there.

At some point the Diaoyu Islands will be mentioned.  (Next year it will be some other territory.)  There are two options to deal with this.  The first is to completely dodge the issue.  The best way to do this is to say, “I love that band!” and start humming a tune.  Confusion will ensue, and hopefully you can change the subject by talking about Jay Chow.

If drinking has already started when this issue comes up, you have an opportunity to start a round of competitive drinking.  Raise a glass to Chinese sovereignty.  Take a large gulp of baijiu, and then accuse the other male relatives of being pussies.  Be sure to pick on one family member the entire time, offering to switch orange juice if he can’t handle alcohol.  The goal is to have him be the first one to quit drinking.

Here is a list of territorial disputes you can drink to:

* Socotra Rock (中国苏岩礁, *Zhōngguó Sūyánjiāo*), “administered” by the Republic of Korea.
* Spratly Islands (中国南沙群岛, *Zhōngguó Nánshā Qúndǎo*)
* South Tibet (中国藏南, *Zhōngguó Zàngnán*), “administered” by India.
* Macclesfield Bank (中国中沙群岛, *Zhōngguó Zhōngshā Qúndǎo*), claimed by the Philippines.
* Paracel Islands (中国西沙群岛, *Zhōngguó Xīshā Qúndǎo*), claimed by Vietnam.
* Scarborough Shoal (中国黄岩岛, *Zhōngguó Huángyán Dǎo*), claimed by the Philippines.
* Trans-Karakoram Tract (中国喀喇昆仑走廊, *Zhōngguó Kālǎkūnlún Zǒuláng*), claimed by India.
* Maritime Province (中国滨海边疆区, *Zhōngguó Bīnhǎi Biānjiāngqū*), “administered” by Russia.

By the time you get to the Paracel Islands, you should probably excuse yourself to go to the bathroom to vomit.  You should do this multiple times throughout the night.  You are outnumbered, and have no chance.  When you get the idea that everyone is pretty drunk, declare that you hope there are no Japanese products in the house, because you are boycotting them.  There will be a round of cheers, assuring you that they have all boycotted Japanese goods.  Ignore the fact that you were picked up from the airport in a Toyota, the elevator in the building was made by Mitsubishi, the television that will be on all evening is made by Sony, all the kitchen appliances used to prepare the food were produced by Sino-Japanese joint ventures, and the poster in the oldest cousin’s room is of [Sola Aoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_Aoi) (SFW).

During the dinner, only about 20% of the food will look appetizing.  Half of that will be white rice, and the other half will be the dishes you can't reach.  Eat everything you are offered, but spit it out into a napkin if it is inedible, like the chicken skull.  Don't ask what it is called.  You don't know the Chinese word for ""duck vagina,"" anyway.

If you have planned ahead, after the dinner you can use what I like to call ""fuck you treats.""  You know when a Chinese person offers you a piece of chicken with gristle, an artery, skin, and a jagged bone sticking out of it?  That's a fuck-you-treat.  A fuck-you-treat is something one culture finds appealing, but another culture does not.  The Western World's most formidable fuck-you-treat is Blue cheese.  Offer everyone a large piece, and then remark how good it smells.  When everyone has reluctantly swallowed and is trying to keep it down, tell them how you let it sit on your balcony for three weeks before it got this good. 

At some point in the evening, an uncle will produce a catalogue of the products produced by his company.  He will be interested in doing foreign trade.  Tell him you are intoxicated, but you know quality bicycle tires when you see them.  Ask him about pricing on units in the millions.  Tell him that is a damn good deal.  Put the catalog in your backpack, and tell him you will give it serious consideration after the holidays. You know the phone number you used while studying abroad here that you still remember?  Give that to him.  It was an honest, intoxicated mistake.

You will notice you have not seen your girlfriend for a long time.  The men and women have separated.  The men are trying to see how much alcohol you can drink before dying, and the women are interrogating your girlfriend about marriage plans.  Go find her.

Stumble into the room, sit down next to grandma, put your arm around her, and start acting like you have confused her with your girlfriend.  This will either be met with laughter and the grandma will accept you, or you will never be invited back again.  Both outcomes have their benefits.

At night, you will be told you are sleeping on the couch, or on an air mattress on the floor of a cousin's room.  Bring extra warm pajamas for the night.  Despite everyone in the family having an iPhone, they will turn off the heating at night to save a few yuan.

Hopefully you brought some snacks in your backpack, because you definitely did not get full from dinner.  The next day will sort of just be a repeat of the first day, because you don't remember anyone's name, nor their relation to your girlfriend.  ""Is she the *dàyí* or the *sānyí*? Shit.""

From then on you just act like a sport and take cues from your girlfriend.  You only have to go through this for a few more days, at most.  You can then use this experience of cross-cultural understanding against her when she refuses to wash your socks and underwear together.",,False,,t5_2qh2v,1360318693.0,,,True,t3_184ifa,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/184ifa/so_youre_going_to_your_girlfriends_hometown_for/,

I'm sure it's going to be common knowledge to some, but I guess some others are completely ignorant of this entire world.

*50 RMB: you have to be in a really podunk city, and find some back alley basement with nongmings. The women are prob like 40+ and completely disgusting.

*100-150 RMB: BBS (which stands for barbershop). Full sex, one time, prob 20minutes ish, condom on. I think the name comes from fake barbershops that have a really bare ""fake barbershop"" first floor. It's super obvious bc there's like all of one chair, like no hair products, and just a bunch of skimpily dressed girls standing around. You then get led to the second floor for the sex. I don't see many of these anymore though. Now the telltale sign is pink lighting, and frosted glass doors. Often the frosted glass will have a clear strip so you can see the girls inside. They're typically sitting on a red couch doing absolutely nothing. Works the same way though. They're practically on every other street in every single city.

*500 RMB: Outcall girls with agencies. When you sleep in a two star hotel and get stuffed those small notecards under your door, that's what you get. You text the guy what kind of girl you want, and she comes over in like half an hour. Full sex, prob 40ish minutes. The girls in general are pretty mediocre and look like they just got off work at the factory. You are technically allowed to turn her away at the door if you don't like her, but usually you gotta pay roundrip cabfare.

*700 RMB: solo prostitutes. They do their own advertising, and you contact them on QQ. Just use google to find a forum for your own city, an you'll find reviews of various girls. Ofc, the reviews are written by themselves (ie advertisements). Ask for a picture, cam if you're lucky (but usually no cam), and ask for the rate. Don't bullshit around about getting to know them and shit. They don't want to waste time. If they do waste time, it means they're desperate for business and not in demand.

One pop, prob for about 20mins-60mins, depending on how much they like you. Anything goes if they really really like you. These girls are pretty good looking. They tout themselves as ""part time"", but we all know that's not the truth. It's some silly mythos of the poor university girl trying to become a doctor and being short on rent. They can be bitchy though, since there's no oversight agency.

*600-1500: Sauna prostitutes. Any sauna building with a bright billboard and flashing lights, which is NOT a franchise chain, has these services. [Optional part: go in, shower, change out of your clothes and into their PJs, then hang around the communal level. There's TV, pool, food/fruit, drinks, movies. Also normal massages. Just chillax time]. When you're ready, you go to the hookers floor. A supervisor will greet you and ask you what kind of girl you want. I advise slipping him 50-100 RMB so that he brings you quality girls. They'll send anywhere from 3 to 20+ girls and have them line up in front of you. When they introduce themselves, see who is bubbly and makes eye contact, and who is dismissive. (Pick the former, obviously). Then you guys get to it. Specific rules will vary with the establishment. In general, you can either let them take the lead, or you can tell them what you feel like and orchestrate the whole thing (what's up let's get to know each other and chat, ok now i feel like having sex, ok now i feel like a blowjob, etc.)

*1500-2500+: KTV prostitutes. Any KTV building with bright billboards and flashing ights, which is not a frnchise chain. You go in a room, and the whole supervisor interaction thing goes down. Then you guys can sing ktv and play drinking games. Groping optional, depending on how much she likes you and how strict the place is. Sitting fee (they chill with you, flirt with you, etc.) is usually 300 ish. Also gotta hit spending limit for the KTV room (500 RMB ish), and tip the DJ (person who operates the KTV system so you don't have to yourself) and shit for another 100-200. You can take them back to your hotel for one session (so like 3hrs) for an extra 700, or take them back for the night for 1000+.  Anything goes if they really like you.

10,000+: Be extremely rich and/or powerful. Anything goes, or you'll have everyone fired bc the owner is your bitch.

That's a reaaaally quick overview of prostitution in China. AMA I guess.

**Edit for those who are offended**: I'm sorry that you are offended, but I'm not sorry for having offended you. You should have known better when you clicked on the thread. I only made this thread because /r/China has been talking about prostitution a lot lately. I hope you found the information interesting, even if you are against the practice. Common sense time: /r/China isn't JUST about prostitutes; China is not just about prostitutes; expats in China is not just about prostitutes.  

**Edit 3**: blanket response to some common objections

* *""You're supporting sex slaves.""* Human trafficking *in regards to Chinese prostitutes in China* is greatly exaggerated. I've heavily cherry-picked my quotes. Please read the entire link to get the full picture.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China#Prostitution_after_1978

&gt;Over the past decade, there has been a recognition that the majority of women who enter prostitution do so of their own accord.[39][40] The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options. There also seems to be a growing acceptance of prostitution. 

* *Prostitutes are abused, coerced, pressured, etc.*: yes true.

&gt;Apart from incidences of violence directly associated with prostitution, an increasing number of women who sell sex have been physically assaulted, and even murdered, in the course of attempts to steal their money and property.[47] There have also been a growing number of criminal acts, especially incidences of theft and fraud directed at men who buy sex, as well as bribery of public servants.

Also in this bag is any form of financial/psychological coercion.

Unfortunately that is rampant across all industries in China. If you keep up with news in China at all, you should be aware of this. Yes, it probably happens more in this industry. I don't feel that I am condoning or supporting those behaviors. I still attended school (I'll only pass you if you sleep with me), I still eat at restaurants (I'll only hire you if you sleep with me), I still go to the bank (I'll only promote you if you sleep with me). 

* *""Okay maybe you are nice to prostitutes, but others are not.""* Yes, and I don't feel guilty about that. I also drink alcohol, even if there are abusive alcoholics.

* *Everything you wrote is anecdotal only*: the whole ""well that's just your personal experience man"" is too commonly used. If I've visited a number of establishments in various cities, and talked to those girls and also chatted about their friends, that's a very varied sample group and not something to dismiss automatically. Everything I've read from the accounts of others to academic and professional reports on these things also line up with what I've said. If you have something to offer for the opposition, please link it.

* *This is bad for /r/China*. One single thread should not and does not represent a whole forum, nor does it represent an entire group of people or a country of people. We can acknowledge and discuss a topic without condoning it.

* *You are fat and lonely and can't get laid otherwise*: I mainly see expats picking up prostitutes in bars. I've never seen them in saunas. I see them in KTVs very rarely. 99% of customers I've seen are natives. People visit prostitution for so so so many reasons. They might be unattractive (physically or personality wise) and can't get the companionship otherwise. They might be out of town on business and can't put in the time to get laid the traditional way. They might be husbands who are tired of their wives. They might just be seeking the new experience for the thrill of it. They might be virgins who can't overcome their sexual anxiety. (And lastly, prostitution plays a huge role in business and government relationships. Not sure if this is true in other countries, but the other reasons all apply internationally). The more you know :)

Not sure if anyone's actually interested in reading this- but it might prove useful or amusing to someone somewhere out there. I'll highlight three guys I've had the pleasure of seeing in my time in China- who are as follows:


**The Controller, The Fu Er Dai, and Mr. Popular**

---


**The Controller**

The Controller was the first guy I dated here, who I started seeing not too long after I stepped off the plane into my 4-th tier university town. You can probably tell by the nickname I gave him that this particular story does not have even a remotely happy ending. A piece of advice to the ladies out there who are freshly-off-the-boat: be *very* fucking careful of who you see and who you trust when you first arrive.

See, there's special circumstances to consider when dating men in a new country and culture- especially when you don't know the language. If I had known more Chinese at that time- I probably could've saved myself a lot of trouble. When you first get here it's like you're trapped in a bubble. You have no support system, no friends, and no knowledge of what “proper” (according to Chinese culture) social interaction consists of. Your knowledge of the things happening around you is limited to how you perceive them through the “western culture” filter in your mind, and since there is a huge language/communication disconnect between you and everyone around you- the truth is *so* easy to manipulate.  

As I got more and more fluent in Chinese, I slowly started realizing certain things didn't match up about my boyfriend. I eventually learned that he absolutely *loved* to lie. He'd lie about everything and anything- from big things, to things that didn't even matter. Sometimes he'd lie just to see if you were gullible enough to believe him. And when out with friends- he'd like to talk *for me*- put words into my mouth. Seemingly whatever words the listener wanted to hear the most. By the end of the night, he'd have every Chinese person at the party raving about how amazing and inspirational our “love story” is- even when his version of the story wasn't even half true. He would also constantly “mis-translate” things I would say- and when confronted about it- he'd claim it was an accident. 

He also had me convinced that several of our mutual friends were no longer interested in hanging out with me. But of course, when I worked up the language skills to confront the friends myself- I learned that my boyfriend had told them it was *I* that wasn't interested in meeting with them. He had successfully cut off a large portion of my support network this way, and prevented me from making many friends. I guess guys like him just need a woman to control- and they see a FOB foreigner as perfect opportunity. Small support network- easy to manipulate because of the language barrier- and they can get away with almost anything and then blame it on “Chinese culture,” regardless of whether or not it actually is.

So piece of advice number 1- **learning Chinese** is absolutely paramount to successfully avoiding a situation like mine. And if you find your date “mistranslating” for you or encouraging you to rely on him to the point of being socially handicapped- take that as a huge red flag, and question everything he tells you from then on.

---

**The Fu Er Dai** 

This guy was an almost comical caricature of every fu er dai stereotype there is. He loved everything western- luxury brands, cars, food, alcohol, and women. In the short time I was seeing him, he went through about 3 or 4 cars, bought closets full of brand name clothes, and seemed to be constantly jetting around the country, spending almost every other weekend in Shanghai. He was also the kind of rich where if he called you up and said, “Come over to my house,” you'd have to ask, “Which one?”

But the weird thing is- he was actually one of the best guys I've ever had the chance to meet. Not only was he honest, considerate and open-minded, but he was an absolute blast. He's the kind of guy a western girl could really relax around. He never made you feel self-conscious about speaking your mind, being loud, drinking beer, messily eating 串 by the roadside or smoking in a public place. And after doing so many things that would make you an irrevocable “bad girl” in the eyes of most Chinese- he'd tell you to “do whatever makes you happy” and not to care about the opinions of close-minded assholes. The two of us together could make almost any situation fun- grocery shopping, aimlessly driving around, taking a walk or exploring the city's deserted apartment complexes at midnight.

I started dating him at the point where my Chinese was pretty good. Which is lucky- because he couldn't string a single fluent English sentence together and wasn't about to apologize for it. Although he could manage a “fuck you” every once in a while, and thought it was amusing to pull out a 100 RMB note and curse Mao ZeDong's portrait at the top of his lungs. Which brings me to piece of advice number 2- please **give the non-English speakers a chance**. Some of the nicest guys I know here also happen to be the ones that don't speak a lick of English. Remember The Controller from above? His English was excellent- and look where that ended up. Also, dating a guy with zero English skills is going to force you to learn Chinese at a light-speed rate, and that's never a bad thing.

So where did my relationship with Fu Er Dai end up? Well- he's a busy guy with a fast-paced life, and it just so happened that I didn't fit into it as well as we'd both previously thought. I was chained to whatever job or school gives me a visa- and he wanted to be able to do breakfast in Beijing and then lunch in Xi'An and come home just in time to hit the clubs.  

I never asked for or accepted a single material possession from him in our entire relationship- but before parting, he forced me to accept a gift to remember him by. Maybe I seem overly romantic about the notion- but the white jade bangle hangs on my arm in remembrance of the guy who taught me so much about living life and accepting yourself. So I say this in the most loving way possible- 下辈子见, you rich asshole.

---

**Mr. Popular**

Mr. Popular is my current boyfriend. I gotta say, he's a good guy. But goddamn- he is so fucking *popular*. Almost annoyingly so. Every time we walk around campus together- we bump into maybe 3 or 4 of his many friends within 15 minutes of heading out the door. Almost every night of the week he's outside eating or drinking with a different group of buddies, and he keeps himself very busy with university clubs, competitions, and activities.

So it seems great, right? He's charismatic, loved by practically everyone, his academic achievements will go down in our university's history, he's involved with many hobbies, and he has a huge support network and safety net. And last but not least- he's also slightly locally famous for dating *me*. What could possibly go wrong? 

Almost everything could go wrong. See, he's an amazing guy- but he really jumped the gun on our relationship. Like many relationships with Chinese guys- ours developed at light-speed. We soon became the talk of the campus- and there was practically a waiting list of friends who wanted to meet me or take me out to dinner. And when word got around that I met his parents over Spring Festival vacation, it was considered by everyone to be serious. Like, on-the-fast-track-to-marriage kind of serious.  

So what would happen now if I decided I didn't want to settle down at the tender age of 21? What if, like many young people, my priorities change and he no longer fits into my vision of my ideal life? Here's what will happen- I won't be able to get a job in this town ever again. There's something a little dangerous about dating a Chinese guy whose guanxi runs far and deep- and that's if he ever decides to punish you for leaving him or breaking his heart- he can make your life so miserable you'll have to flee for the next province over.

So the final tip- tip number 3. **Make sure your relationship is somewhat secret until you're absolutely sure you're serious about him.** Once it becomes “serious”- he is going to brag to every single friend and distant relative he has about his beautiful 爱情故事 of borderless love, sacrifice and overcoming hardship. That's a *lot* of people who now view you as some kind of angel and shining beacon of selflessness and morality. You now have the potential to disappoint a lot of people- and the second you decide maybe the relationship isn't going the way you want it- you revert back to foreign temptress up-to-no-good whore status. Times one thousand. And especially since if you can't speak Chinese- he has the power to spin the story any way he wants it and you can't tell them all otherwise. 

So what to take away from this one? **Be very aware of the development of your relationship with a Chinese guy**- because it can go from “just friends” to “betrothed” before you even have time to notice it. Chinese social circles seem to be a lot bigger than western ones- and that's a lot of people who at best, will be disappointed at your break-up, and at worst, will vilify you. This is most true for those of us who live in small cities- in Beijing or Shanghai- you ladies are lucky enough to probably get a free pass on this one.

I'm now humbly asking for some advice on my particular situation, which is this:

I'm graduating with my BA this June. I'm sick of where I live, and I love to travel and want to work abroad for at least a year. I've been researching teaching ESL abroad and have decided that China is where I would like to go because it's such a diverse country, very historically and culturally rich and, because one of my best friends is currently teaching in Dalian and his experiences there have been resoundingly positive. His contract is up in September and we plan to travel together a while (2-3 weeks) before we go our separate ways and I settle down somewhere and start looking for work. I've saved up roughly $10,000 which should last a while and cover start up costs and all that.

I've dealt with recruiters online, but from what I've read they just seem to be unnecessary middlemen and I should be able to find work on the ground. Am I correct in assuming so? I'm a native speaker (caucasian - I know this matters, it is what it is I guess..), with a Bachelor's Degree and from what I've read, that should be ample qualification to find a teaching gig. I'm hoping to find work in a ""2nd tier"" city, if my understanding of the tier system is correct - from what I've read and heard, Dalian, Nanjing, Qingdao and Xiamen all sound like awesome cities. I'm not entirely sure where I'll end up, given that I have no absolute set itinerary for travel, but I plan on visiting some of these places and connecting with the expat communities there and hearing some firsthand accounts of what it's like to live there before I make up my mind definitively. Is it realistic to expect to be able to find employment in said cities, given my limited experience? I have been volunteering through a local ESL program for the past six months to gain some classroom experience, but it isn't much, I know.

I want to work legally, on a z visa, but I'll be coming to China on a tourist visa. From what I understand, I should be able, with a letter of invitation from a potential employer, to covert my tourist visa to a z visa via Bangkok or HK or possibly through Mongolia. Is this correct? I want to be patient and find a respectable employer to work for legally. I don't want to get roped into working illegally for a shady employer on a tourist visa. Ideally, I would like to work for ~20 hours a week. What do you suppose a reasonable salary to expect may be? I realize this answer depends largely on which city I'll be working in, but I'd like to make at least 6000RMB per month. Is this realistic?

What do you think of my plan? I know I'm young and naive but I'm just looking for something different; I realize that living in China will have its challenges, but I refuse to be discouraged by some of the more cynical comments I've read on here and on other expat forums. I'm really looking forward to getting away, to traveling through a beautiful country, to dedicating my time to my interests and living humbly and for all of the interesting people I'll undoubtedly meet.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I appreciate any and all comments and critiques. Please don't be too hard on me.

1367821619.0,178,self.China,1ds29v,For female expats looking for info/resources/personal experience about having an abortion in China.,,212,34,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1ds29v/for_female_expats_looking_for/,"I just wanted to share my story in case (like I was) there is another female expat out there looking for information on the experience of having an abortion in China. I was frantically searching the web for information on this when I found out I was pregnant here and found next to nothing, so maybe my story can help someone or put another worried expat at ease.

I found out I was pregnant while doing May Day vacation with my (Chinese) boyfriend in Beijing. I live and study in a small town in northern Shaanxi province, a tiny city where practically everyone knows me and my boyfriend, so in Beijing at least we could go to the store and buy a pregnancy test at Watson's without risking seeing someone we knew.

We did the test back at our hotel and it was positive. 

Our time in Beijing was running out and I accepted the fact that we'd have to wait to go back to our small, 4th tier city and get it done there.

We came back on a Friday night, and set out for the hospital the next morning. For those who are wondering about the specific hospital I went to, it was 榆林第一医院 in 榆林 city of Shaanxi province, and I highly reccomend it. Very modern, clean and (somewhat) professional.

The first order of business was to check in (挂号). We filled out a simple paper with my name, sex, age, and handed it to the clerk. She formatted and gave us a special card (looks like a credit card with a barcode) that electronically tracks the proceedures you do and the perscriptions you get. That was kinda cool. The check in proceedure is simple and any expat with basic Chinese skills can do it alone. The card and check in cost 10 yuan.

Next we go upstairs and find the women's health/OBGYN area (妇产科). It's important to note at this particular hospital, there's a 2 hour period in the middle of the day where the doctors are off work. So the day is divided into two parts, morning and afternoon. I suggest checking out the hospitals hours or calling beforehand to find out when you can see a doctor, because waiting in the OBGYN area for so long was a little awkward, especially when all the Chinese people around are going to be asking you questions/trying to talk to you/find out why you're there.

When all the doctors got back from lunch, we had to go into a small office where there were two doctors with computers. They're the ladies you go see and tell what you're there for and what you need. We told them I hadn't had my period in a long time, and they asked for specific dates and if I had any symptoms of pregnancy. After that, they typed up some things on the computer, scanned our card, and printed out a slip/form (单子) for an ultrasound. Before doing each procedure or test, you have to pay. So we paid downstairs, got a receipt, and took the receipt back upstairs to the ultrasound place.

I'm not sure why they do ultrasounds to check for pregnancy rather than a typical pee test, but this way you can actually see the results instantly and it's kind of cool to watch the screen and see your insides. This is called a B超 or 超声. 

I waited my turn and went into the room. They had me unbutton my pants and tiny bit, squirted on some gel, and did the test. Just FIY, they have to press really hard to get a picture and it was a little uncomfortable, but it doesn't really *hurt*. On the screen, they highlighted a part which I suppose is the fetus, and confirmed I was pregnant, and then they printed out a page with two pictures of the results. The ultrasound cost around 60 yuan.

After that, we had to report back to that little office from before. When we showed them the results and confirmed we wanted to terminate the pregnancy, they sent us off for more tests. Next up was an ECG (heart test) which they call 心电图. Like before, we got a slip they we took downstairs to pay with and then headed up to the testing room. I think you can see by now that there's a lot of running around in this process. The whole shibang takes an entire afternoon, so plan accordingly. 

The ECG is my least favorite because you have to (partially) take off your shirt, bra, and expose your legs. I had forgotten to shave my legs that day so that was embarassing, but quite frankly the least of my problems at the time. It was a simple test that took less than 2 minutes and cost about 40 yuan. It's the same ECG test you probably got after applying for a job/to a university.

We ran back to the office and got another slip for the next test- a blood test. This cost about 65 yuan and was simple, the results only took 3 minutes to get. It's just a standard blood drawing thing. I noticed the lady who drew my blood wasn't wearing gloves though, and had my boyfriend mention that to her. She looked embarrassed and sheepishly said- ""Um... It's just easier to do without gloves."" Um, okay.

So by this point we had done an ultrasound, ECG, and blood test. The final test was the worst part- the internal exam. I was led into a room with two gynocological chairs with a curtain between them. At your hospital it's likely similar, they have to get many people done in a short amount of time so they do it assembly-line style. My boyfriend couldn't come into this room with me so I had to communicate with the doctor myself, which really isn't a problem. She gave me a little blue sheet, told me to put it on the chair, remove ONE LEG of my pants and underwear then lie on the table. 

There are a lot of girls going in and out of and around these rooms, but I was still a little shell shocked when I saw another girl (patient) basically walk in and decide to watch me take my pants and underwear off. I stood there looking dumb for a few minutes before the doctor caught on and told her to GTFO. So don't be surprised if there's very little privacy while getting your tests and exams done. This is China, afterall. 

At this time there's another girl behind the curtain beside me and she's getting undressed too, but I make it onto the table first so the doctor inspects me first. I should mention now that I have never gotten a gyno exam in my life, so I was feeling really embarrassed and awkward. The doctor tells me not to be nervous and she pulls out a sterile, disposable, plastic speculum from its package. 

The attitude and method they use while conducting this exam is similar to how some people feel that ripping off a bandaid as fast and as violently as possible will get it over sooner and with less suffering. So she shoves (there was actual shoving going on) the speculum into my vagina, wastes no time turning and then expanding it as fast as possible. Ow. Ow. OW. My eyes widen and I'm seconds away from complaining about the pain (I have a somewhat high pain tolerance, but this was pretty bad.) and then it's finally over, she pulls it out after mentioning it's all normal down there. The next step was to, as she put it, ""摸一下"" where she put two fingers inside me and pressed down onto my abdomen with the other hand. That wasn't pleasant either but it was leagues better than step 1. She 摸'd in 3 places, each time asking, ""疼不疼?"" to which I answered 不疼. Then it was over and I could finally get up and put my pants on. 

As I was wrangling with my jeans and boots I could hear her move on to examine the girl next to me, who made a *very* vocal protest about the pain during her examination. I don't blame her, it wasn't fun, but the sounds she made sounded Japanese AV-esque and was really disturbing.

So with the last examination over we could go to the office again and get the final verdict from the two ladies. They looked over all the tests and said I was fit for an abortion. 

There are two options. Medical abortion (药流) and surgical abortion (人工流产手术 which is abbreviated as 人流). Before you jump on it and immediately choose the medical abortion, like I wanted to, you should consider the facts. The lady told me that overall, the medical abortion only has an 80% effectiveness (not sure if that's true), sometimes causing incomplete abortions. Also there's a much longer recovery period and many nasty side effects like vommiting and nausea and excess bleeding. 

Also it's not as if you can just take the medication and go home to abort in peace, the pill comes in two steps. You take pill number 1 first when at home, and then a day or two later have to come back to the hospital and take pill number 2 under the supervision of a doctor, who will watch you bleed out for what can be up to 3 hours. They have to ensure that the fetus is completely aborted so I imagine there's some inspecting of the stuff coming out of you going on.

It's not at all as pleasant or non-invasive as it seems at first. So I chose surgical abortion, the cost of which is 1500 yuan. When I made my boyfriend question the lady about anesthesia during the procedure, at first the lady wanted to write me up for a friggin' *epidural*.  Apparently this option is cheaper than getting full anesthesia (going to sleep) so she figured that's the one we wanted. But I made a big fuss to my boyfriend about getting a needle in the spine so we got it changed to the full anesthesia. This part is *really* important. Make sure you're clear when selecting anesthesia options, because I was still worried even after going home about them accidently misunderstanding and changing it back to the epidural option, getting an injection in the spine is not something anyone looks forward to.

So the day is over, the appointment is set for Monday (they don't offer the surgical abortion service on weekends), and I get to go home. They told me to not eat or drink water the morning of the operation. 

The morning rolls around and I go to the hospital bright and early. We have to walk around and find the doctor who for some reason wasn't in his office at the time (the only male doctor in the entire process you will meet is probably going to be the one who does the actual abortion). So we find him, talk for a bit, and he writes up a slip that we use to go pay. After payment we go up to the ""abortion theatre."" It was a very nice, clean looking room with lots of equipment and everything was all ready for me. I take off one leg of my pants and underwear and mount the table. I was surprised that so many doctors (5 or 6) were present for the operation.

I'm in the room without my boyfriend so I chat with the doctors while they're preparing. They put an IV drip in one hand and a heart moniter on the other. It was the first time they discovered I could actually speak Chinese so we all had a laugh while the female nurses compliment my skin tone and looks. They strap my legs onto the table, but the straps were soft and very elastic so it didn't feel confining or horror movie like at all. For some reason, at that point I wasn't scared or in a bad mood. The doctor puts a 氧气 (oxygen) mask over my face and turns on the IV drip with the sleepy stuff in it. My last words to the doctor before completely blacking out were ""瞌睡了...""

I woke up feeling very drugged and dazed. There were nurses struggling to put my underwear and pants back on and suddenly my boyfriend comes out of no where and picks me up and carries me to a bed on the other side of the room. I was half out of it and decided I wanted to get a pad from my purse and put it on, but I soon realized that the doctors had already put a thick wad of tissues into my underwear to catch the blood. 

At that point, I felt no pain at all. In fact, it was really alright. I'd even go as far as to say it was nice. If you've gotten your wisdom teeth out, just imagine the feeling of waking up all happy and loopy in the dentist's chair. Not bad at all. Also, my boyfriend informed me that he had only been waiting a little more than *seven minutes* for the operation to be over. At first I didn't believe the doctor when he said it'd take less than 15 minutes, but it seriously does go that fast.

So a few minutes pass and I can finally stand. Still feeling good. We walk into the hall and find a place for me to sit while my boyfriend goes off and gets all the perscriptions filled. They give us two different antibiotics to prevent infection in the uteris and something called ""motherwart"" in English which supposedly helps ""replenish blood."" Not sure about the effectiveness of the last one, but the doctors told me to take it, so I'll do it. After a total of half an hour I'm feeling pretty sober so we get a cab and go home.

And that's it. So here I am now, sitting in my dorm, only a few hours after having had the abortion done and I'm not feeling bad or painful at all. Honestly the experience was not bad, despite being slightly panicked and worried throughout the process. I'll give some final important notes/tips for those who are considering getting an abortion done here in China.

1. Bring a Chinese friend. Preferably a female friend that you trust. There wasn't much hard vocabulary I came across except the names of medicines and the description of the operation procedure. But you're going to want someone to give the doctor *clear* instructions about your choice of abortion method and the anesthesia option you want. 

2. Be aware of the time. The first day, you'll be doing a lot of tests and going back and forth between floors, paying and then running up to do various tests. For the test day, you'll need an entire afternoon. For the operation day, you'll need just a little more than an hour, with the actual procedure being less than 10-15 minutes. Get there early on operation day so you don't have to wait long.

3. Bring a lot of money. It wasn't too expensive, but you won't want to be caught without enough to finish all your tests. The entire two days cost me about 2300 yuan, including the operation, perscriptions, tests and various other fees.

4. The testing is way worse than the actual abortion. Seriously, I promise. The abortion itself is nothing to worry about and you will feel next to no pain at all afterwards. It feels kind of crampy and bloaty, just like a period that's slightly worse than normal. The testing process, however, was stressful, a little scary, and the internal exam was painful. 

5. You can't have sex for a *month* afterwards. At least that's what the doctors said, so I'm sticking to it. Also don't forget to take your perscriptions.

6. My final piece of advice, *get the surgical abortion option*. It sounds scary at first, especially with the word ""surgical"" in front of it, but honest to God it wasn't a bad experience at all. I would much rather do this option than be all nauseous for days and have to bleed out for hours under the supervision of a doctor. Also the success rate is so much higher this way.

So that's it. I sincerely hope my retelling of my experience can help another girl like me who is scared of doing an abortion or similar procedure here in China. I hope someone can find this information valuable and wish you the best of luck.

His father likes me but on multiple occasions has commented on how other black people are lazy, stupid, or destroying America.  This makes me seriously want to reconsider my major, my interests, often times my feelings for my Chinese friends.  I have on many occasions experienced colorblind racism from white or even other black friends, but never such blatant, unapologetic disdain or racism toward blacks.  I just want to know why.
TL; DR  I've faced a lot of blatant racism from Chinese people, moreso than from any other group, why is this?

EDIT:  So the actual racists of Reddit have come out now and this has devolved into me trying to prove something about black people... Sorry if I wasn't clear before as I'm getting some well deserved flak for this.  The Chinese people who I have encountered who acted this way towards me were prejudiced... most likely they were not racists.  My experiences with Chinese people are not accurate reflections of the Chinese populace as a whole so don't take them that way.  Nevertheless other people have had similar experiences with prejudice from Chinese Americans and Chinese people in China, I'm sure people have also had significantly uncomfortable experiences with whites, blacks and other races as well.  These are obviously not related to genetics, DNA, intelligence, or anything else that is inherent.  We have pretty much concluded that these are learned behaviors... I will list some of the more popular conclusions later tonight.  Thanks for contributing, giving me criticism, advice, and speaking your mind.

So what do you want to know about me or my life here or the situation of Chinese in africa.Just ask anything.

Thanks for all the feedback.....Hope my thread could help you somehow.

EDIT1: If you are interested in sexual life of Chinese here.....Here's my answer:

 1,Most Chinese live a puritanic life. 

 2,Some of them bring their partners.

 3,There are Chinese prostitutes.

 4,Only very few of them would have hooked up with locals.

EDIT2: In my spare time I write novels. Fantasy,Sci-Fi. Only to amuse myself. Maybe one day they would be published. And I spend a lot of time online. 

EDIT3: Mostly we don't care or try to attend in local politics.What I know about their government is some names of ministers we have to contact with in business and the name of their president. My boss survived a riot in 2005 during the chaos caused by the death of former president. It's very scary according to his description.

EDIT4: About myself. I love reading and wring fantasy and sci-fi. I am a fan of russian culture and literature. And of course I love American culture. The best fantasy and sci-fi is written by amricans. Hope one day I could travel to US.

EDIT5:Something I am planning. Week ago I was suffering from depression. I feel better now but I don't think I would be completely well until I go back to China. But I was bonded by my job here that I can't leave for now until end of this year....I'm not a traveler at all. Perhaps a lot of you foreigner have been to more places in China than I have. So I'm planning to have a trip in China or euriope. I love Serbia and Russia. So Mostly I would travel to these two countries in the winter. Winter in Moscow, I just love it.

EDIT6: An interesting fact. TOGOLAISE PEOPLE and other africans DO wear DOWN JACKETS and COATS !!! Unbelievable, right? They seem to have very little tolerance to cold(cool) weather. 24 degree and a little wind or rain means very cold to them.....Especially those motorbikers who have to drink fast in the wind.

EDIT7: The major public transportation here in Togo and many other african countries is motorbike. Cheap motorbikes are their taxis. Most people take motorbike to move to another place. Thanks to chinese merchants who sell cheap Chinese motorbikes here. A lot of people could afford this cheap vehicles and make a living from it. Though I have to say the Chinese bikes have quite low qualities. Very polluting, very noisy, not very comfortable, high failure rate(which motivate the spare parts market).....

EDIT8: An redditer pointed out my ignorance generalization and prejudice shown in my speech toward African people. I realize I am wrong or generalizing about many things. I'm not going to erase it but if it offended you, I apologize.

I also think it's ridiculous that so many Chinese people are getting all worked up over them... in my mind they don't care about the islands but rather just venting their anger towards Japan. I went to the protest to take pictures and observe. 

It was a *really* racist protest. Chants of ""日本鬼子""... lots of banners calling for Japan to be flattened, for China to go to war with Japan, another one that said ""Japanese People get the hell out of China."" There were a few thousand people there, all decked out in Chinese flags and wearing red and stuff. In front of the embassy people were throwing rocks, eggs, and trash at the building. 

There were *hundreds* of police and military there to keep the peace. They weren't interfering, just standing on the sidelines watching and keeping things in check. I was only there about 10 minutes before a cop grabbed me and interrogated me about if I was a reporter or what. I forgot to bring my passport or any sort of identification, and I told him so, but he didn't mind... I guess I'm lucky because they probably could have arrested me for not having my passport on me. 

Then the cop told me that I had to leave, ""for my safety"". I didn't want any trouble, so I left. He took me behind the police lines and I left through the back... while I was leaving (on a near-empty street), a group of protestors were walking towards me, eyeing me, and I heard them say something about ""外国人"". With all the anti-foreigner sentiment in the air, I thought it was a good idea to say ""中国加油!"" to them... they laughed, and I went on my merry way.

A little bit scary but definitely one of the more interesting experiences I've had in China. I have a bunch of photos and videos, I'll get them uploaded soon and edit this post.

**Edit 2:** Another thing I forgot to mention is that I believe the police may have been using cell-phone jamming technology. I know that they were having buses skip the stops nearby the embassy to control the amount of people coming it, it wouldn't surprise me if they were jamming phones to prevent people from organizing. After I was ejected by the cop, I tried calling some people but my phone kept telling me ""network busy""... once I was a few hundred meters away it worked fine again.

He lived in 河南 during the famine depicted in the recent movie ""Back to 1942"".",mkdz,135,13,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/149774/any_interest_in_an_ama_with_my_granddad_he_lived/,"EDIT: Put the questions in this post and I'll have a new post sometime tomorrow evening.

Edit 2: Going to go see him now, I'll ask him the questions! They're all great questions!

I can take a bunch of questions here, ask him tomorrow, and then post his responses in a new thread.

Here's some background about him:

He was born in 1928 in [叶县, 河南](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_County). He lived there through the 1942-1943 famine. When the Japanese came, he fled to the west. 

After the Japanese surrendered, he came back to 河南. He graduated from high school in [安阳](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyang) in 1947. He was going to go to college, but the Communists surrounded 安阳 and he was unable to flee the city. After the Communists captured the city, he went to 开封 in 1948 to try and apply for college again. However, the Communists surrounded and then captured 开封. After this happened, he decided to join the Communist Party. 

After the civil war ended in 1949, he was sent to 长沙 to work for the government there. In 1952, he was appointed Vice-Mayor of the North District of 长沙. In 1958 he was appointed Mayor of the North District. This was when the [Great Chinese Famine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine) was occurring. 

He was purged and removed from this post in 1963 during the [Cultural Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_revolution). He was then put in charge of managing the [上山下乡运动](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_to_the_Countryside_Movement) for 长沙.  

After the Cultural Revolution, he was assigned to manage the 长沙 Bus Company. He was forced into retirement/purged again in 1982 because the government wanted younger people to be in charge. He still received an official salary, but didn't have to come to work, so he ended up travelling a lot during this time. He officially retired in 1993.

Here are some other anecdotes/stories he's told me about:

During the 1942-43 famine, he was in middle school. He said in the morning all the students would go out and pick wild plants and bark so that the school cafeteria could make them soup for lunch. He would see dead people on the side of the road every day. 

He said the early late 1930s and early 1940s Henan had the ""Four Big Disasters"" (四大灾害): 水, 旱, 蝗, 汤. 水 is the [1938 Yellow River Flood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_Yellow_River_flood). 旱 and 蝗 references the famines of 1942-43 and 汤 references [汤恩伯](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Enbo) who was the commander of military forces in 河南. He said that the military didn't do anything to help out with the famine and as soon as the Japanese showed up, the Nationalist forces all ran away.  

At the time, when a person died, the family didn't bury the deceased because it was too much work. What they did was to take bricks and build sort of a burial mound over them. 汤恩伯 wanted to build a military academy in 南阳. He said people would carry bricks from where he lived all the way to 南阳. Since everyone was so weak from the lack of food, there wasn't a lot of brick production, so they would steal the bricks from the burial mounds to take to build the military academy.

He puts a lot of blame of the [Great Leap Forward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_leap_forward) on the Communist Party. When peasants were ordered to make steel and iron in their backyards, crop production dropped; however, the leaders still reported normal grain production to the state. The state would take their share of grain which left very little grain for the civilians because of the false reporting.

In the 1960s, China was very poor. He said everyone was given ration coupons. Every person received between 27-33 斤 of grain, 1/4斤 of oil, and 1/4 斤of meat per month. One 斤 is a little more than one pound. The yearly ration of cloth was 2.5尺. My grandmother worked at a market, and when fruits and vegetables started to spoil, they would have to cut off the spoiled parts and continue to sell the good parts. She would buy the spoiled parts of the food for a lot less than the unspoiled parts to take home to have more food. 

Additionally, if you wanted to buy electronics, there would be coupons for them. When he was mayor, the entire office only had one telephone. He didn't buy a telephone himself until the 1980s when he was with the bus company. He said he was the first person at his work to buy a telephone. He said the ration coupons stopped sometime around 1990.

He has some resentment towards the Communist Party because of the Great Leap Forward and his purging during the Cultural Revolution. I think he feels that if he wasn't purged, he could have become governor or another high ranking official. He also doesn't look too favorably towards the party because of the rampant corruption. 

So that’s the story of my granddad. If you have anything you want to ask him, leave a comment here. I’ll compile a list and ask him and then try and post the responses tomorrow.

TLDR; My granddad lived through tough times in China, ask him anything

People who are mentally unbalanced. And People with bizarre get rich quick schemes. So I want to know, who was the shadiest person you've met? I'll start:


One guy I knew came to China as a secret missionary years ago. I believe the idea was that he would proselytize while teaching English. But instead of him converting the Chinese it sort of went the other way. He became one of the most depraved people I've ever met. I've never know anyone to start more stories with, ""I woke up in a bathhouse."" He used to go around saying that ""there is no reason to ever masturbate in China since you can always get someone to do it for you."" He would come to a 100 minute class 15 minutes late, leave 20 minutes early and be either hung over or drinking during the class. He once through a toaster through a window when he thought a party was too boring. And after he left, when they cleaned out his apartment, they found dozens of pill bottles that didn't belong to him, and so much trash that it looked like a homeless person lived there.",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,t3_15tir8,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/15tir8/whos_the_shadiest_person_youve_met_in_china/,

Fugui and Jiazhen endure tumultuous events in China as their personal fortunes move from wealthy landownership to peasantry. Addicted to gambling, Fugui loses everything. In the years that follow he is pressed into both the nationalist and communist armies, while Jiazhen is forced into menial work. They raise a family and survive, managing ""to live"" from the 40's to the 70's in this epic, but personal, story of life through an amazing period.-- IMDB

I tried to find other artists today but I couldn't. So I came back and expected them to price gouge the hell out of me.

To my surprise, he had already done it. I was certain nothing had been lost in translation in our previous conversation, yet here it was, completed, even though I could have never came back and found someone else. The artist wasn't there but his wife and child were, and as it turns out he wanted to give it to me for free. After much reluctance, I gave in and accepted without paying.

The wife asked me to sit down and stay for a while, so I obliged. We must have talked for about an hour, which is always great for me - it makes me use words I learned a few months ago but never use in daily conversation.

Leaving, like every other Chinese family it seems, she gave me a bag of fruit for home.

In the last week I've had 6 different students who have told me that American exchange students in our school are asking Chinese English students for help and once they have them in a situation where the students have promised to help they spend the entire time preaching Christianity and pushing the students very strongly to convert. 

My students are very unsure and very shy and don't want to be rude and I would say most students here are the same when it comes to interacting with foreigners, stop abusing that kindness! I've had three different students today tell me that they feel very uncomfortable but have no idea how to respond because they have been told repeatedly that talking about religion is rude so instead they just smile and feel bad. 

If you are religious, great, enjoy your religion, but don't push it on shy, insecure students who don't know how to tell you to piss off when you're being a pushy ass. You are making us all look bad.

If you are religious and don't push it, like most religious people I meet, please don't take offence. This is not directed at all religious people, just at the fanatics who come to China to learn and decide it should be their right to push religion down other people's throats all around the world.

Beijing: Roast the hot dog for hours. Take thin slices of the casing and discard the rest. Serve on warm pancake with hoisin and scallion.

Sichuan: Stir fry chopped up hot dog in a spicy sauce consisting of bean sauce, rice wine, chilis, cumin, anise, cloves, cinnamon, black cardamom, ginger, garlic and Sichuan peppercorns until it tastes like every other 麻辣 dish you've ever eaten.

Xinjiang: Rub hot dog with cumin and MSG. Skewer and roast over an open fire. Say it's lamb.

Jiangsu/Zhejiang: Braise hot dog in red sauce until it is perfect and tender... then ruin it by adding sugar.

Cantonese: In a large pot, boil hot dog all day with lotus seeds and 20 other flavorless ingredients. When done, throw hot dog away and drink soup. The ""essence"" of the hot dog has already been imparted to the broth.

Taiwan: Stir fry chopped up hot dog with basil leaves. After the meal, pour sweetened condensed milk in the bun and call it dessert.

We all spent the next couple of weeks with visions of sitting by the pool with a cool drink in our hands. 


The day finally came for our trip to the resort. We all showed up at our school at some ungodly hour in the morning to wait for the [bug of a bus](http://i.imgur.com/glkl2Gg.jpg) that would take us to our destination. [We had beer](http://i.imgur.com/a024ziU.jpg), so the trip was already off to a good start. We said goodbye to the [Daqing countryside](http://i.imgur.com/fwYBM1c.jpg), and drifted through rural Chinese villages. After a couple of hours on the bus our manager broke out the very phallic snack combo of cucumbers and sausages. Some of the Chinese ladies put their [cucumbers in an interesting place](http://i.imgur.com/5UBk15p.jpg).


After a million piss stops we arrived at [our destination](http://i.imgur.com/YBZ9YZA.jpg). It wasn’t the posh destination we were expecting, but it wasn’t without its own charm.  We were given cabin assignments and everyone scurried off to put their things down and take [their pictures next to the paintings of Chairman Mao](http://i.imgur.com/k2b2gZs.jpg) on the wall of each cabin. 


The first activity of the day was [boating](http://i.imgur.com/anJfkdo.jpg), which was[ pretty fun](http://i.imgur.com/uXz3Oek.jpg), but the boats kept being [blown into the weeds](http://i.imgur.com/7DalTKS.jpg), and needed to be rescued by one of the Chinese workers. 


Next up was [paintball](http://i.imgur.com/sM5QoXP.jpg). Not the typical paintball where you run around shooting each other, instead it was more of a [carnival game](http://i.imgur.com/ykRbhz7.jpg) with [real ducks trapped](http://i.imgur.com/ykjiU6M.jpg) in a small netted area. No one in our group was able to more than graze the birds, but later an employee in another group was a little luckier and the [duck became dinner](http://i.imgur.com/5lLyPUG.jpg). 


Once paintball was done, we rolled up our pant legs to do some fishing. A resort employee carrying a pail full of live fish led everyone to a shallow space filled with water. He tipped the bucket pouring the fish out, and everyone was [given nets and set loose](http://i.imgur.com/hqVjHev.jpg).


The big finale was the obstacle course which unfortunately was to place where the all the [piss, shit](http://i.imgur.com/pPGUJMh.jpg), and [trash](http://i.imgur.com/HNsaZCa.jpg) drained to.  Some of the obstacles  [were impossible](http://i.imgur.com/p1Zf6h1.jpg), others could be done while [holding onto your sunbrella](http://i.imgur.com/XfFGCxT.jpg). 


With everyone’s day drunk winding down it was time to pile back onto the bus and head home. It wasn’t what we had imagined our day to be like, it was a lot better. The day ended with some [puppy holding](http://i.imgur.com/n2ZpcnI.jpg), and pizza from a place that gave you plastic gloves to pick-up the pieces.

I'm from the States and we have our fair share of assholes, delinquents, and uneducated poor. I've sat in theaters in Maryland where people were loudly commenting on the movie, throwing popcorn at the screen. I've walked through Manhattan a dozen times where people bump into me and try to pick a fight.  In DC at night, I've seen fights break out over nothing and bottles being thrown around. Or in the Wal-Marts where people wear less than their pajamas to shop for food and double park cause they're lazy. When my service is poor at a restaurant in Seattle, I don't criticize the entire society for the server bringing my food an hour after I ordered it. When any of these problems occur at home I don't for a second think ""wow Americans are assholes"" or ""America is uncivilized.""  Why should I think differently here?

Yes, the pollution is terrible, traffic is even worse and there's too many people. But your AC breaking down and needing 2 days to fix? That's a problem you'd have back at home. Someone almost hit you while crossing the street? That's everyday in New York. Taking an hour to register an account at ICBC? It took me just as long in Seattle when I had to create and account and find proof of residence.

What I'm trying to say is, 95% of my time here in China, things go smoothly. Yes, there are times where something major happens and fucks up my entire day but those things can happen to me back at home. It's really easy to become disillusioned here in China and develop an us vs them mentality.  When you start seeing common everyday problems as China problems, you're only going to become more angry and disillusioned. Don't let other disillusioned expats bring you down to their level.




Edit: Uhh, oops, the title of the post wasn't suppose to end in a question mark...It's not really a question. Bad proof reading on my part.


**Edit 2**: Wow, a lot more responses than I expected. I think many of you have very valid reason to be frustrated or angry. But I would like to make one more point. Most of us are here because we see China as a place of economic opportunities. I know the reason I'm here is because the economy is shit in the US and I couldn't do what I do and make what I make back at home. Too much competition and not enough jobs. Not so for me here in China. I think about this everyday and really appreciate the fact that I'm here.

I also realize part of the reason I have so many opportunities is precisely because China is a developing country with all sorts of serious issues. Pollution, lack of service in the service industry, corruption and shoddy craftsmanship are all real problems here. But I remind myself that if these problems go away tomorrow then millions more expats will come flooding in, driving the rate and demand for our services we provide lower. It's precisely because there are so many problems here that we are able to succeed and thrive here. Our opportunities exist because China is still a developing nation with serious issue. Take away all of the serious issues and I think you'd find the Chinese would have very little use for many of us.

But, it does have its set of unique advantages, especially the deregulated aspect of it. 

Basically, what I'm thinking is to go to China for a year, teach english, earn monies and use that money for a masters somewhere else. As I'm sure many of you are aware, it is difficult to take large sums of money outside of China, unless you want to go through a ton of paper work, and (I guess, but I'm not sure) some pretty heavy fines/taxes.

What I'm trying to say is, has anyone used bitcoin to transfer large amounts of cash outside of China eg (£10,000, 100,000RMB+?). 

Problems I can see

- Suspicion of money laundering when transferring money back into my UK bank account. How can I explain to the bank manager that the money was genuinely earn't teaching and not for example from selling drugs? If anyone has experience with this then that'd be great!

- Finding a reliable bit coin exchange in China.
https://btcchina.com/ -Is apparently reliable, does anyone know of any others?

- Bitcoin market fluctuates wildly sometimes - I'm not really interested in speculation, so I would probably wait to the point when the market is stable.

I've searched /r/china about posts on this and found very little about it, making me think that it is not really a possibility. In a reddit post I saw that d9-thc had organised a meeting in Beijing which had high attendance, but there was not much more information about it.

Walking around in the Oriental Plaza mall on Wangfujing Rd (just East of Tiananmen Sq.) I was approached by two Chinese girls. The were studying English and wanted to talk to me to improve their language. They were very friendly and being polite I started to talk to them. They were ""window shopping"" in the mall (too expensive for them they explained) and soon we were walking around in the mall talking. I explained that I needed a hair cut and they lead me to a nice salon in the basement where I got a nice hair cut.

Afterwards, we went out on Wangfujing Rd. and the girls helped me to buy a Beijing map. We were also looking for glasses for me. At a certain point the girls asked if we should go for some tea and if I was familiar with the tea house ceremony. I accepted, and went with them to a nearby tea house, which was on the 2nd floor of a Chinese mall (at the left side and the end of Wangfujing Rd.) We were greeted by a Chinese host who lead us to a small room where she explained the various tea making, the various kinds of teas. Of course we tasted them all. It took more than an hour.

Actually, it was very interesting and I learned a lot about Chinese tea. I was asked to buy some tea and I agreed to buy two jars. When the bill for the tea came, one of the girls started looking at it before I got a chance to see it. I asked her ""how much will it be?"", and she said ""I'm gonna need about tree fitty"".

I'm going to share my limited experience about jobs in China, and feel free to add or comment on anything that you feel I'm missing.  Hopefully, we can make this a pretty comprehensive thread and nag brennnnz to put this in the sidebar.

First up, education.

**I just graduated, I'm looking for a program to take me to China!**

1.  Firstly, I'm not a big fan of these ""programs"".  Speaking as someone who's done some international recruitment for a training center, fresh grad recruitment programs are created primarily as a way to save money - typically someone out of a fresh grad program will make about half what someone could on the ground here, plus housing, visa, and (sometimes) a plane ticket.  The best program there is called a ""plane ticket"", as the supply/demand dynamic for English teachers is simply absurd.  When you get your feet on the ground here, go to a bar and talk to other teachers to see where's hiring, check the local classifieds, or just walk into a training center and see what their hiring situation is like.  You'll get a job in 2-3 weeks, guaranteed.

2.  If you simply **must** find a program (you don't have the money to pay for a plane ticket or a security deposit on an apt), check out [Dave's ESL Job Board](http://www.eslcafe.com/jobs/china/).

**What do I need to teach English here?  Is a TEFL required?**

1.  In most cities, you need two out of the following three things to get a teaching job: (1) Be a good teacher (2) Be white (3) Be a native speaker of English.  At some training centers, one will suffice.  

2.  EF, Wall Street, and some of the bigger schools like to require a TEFL certificate, mostly to weed out the backpackers who won't take the job seriously at all.  I like to recommend getting a TEFL certificate, mostly for the same reason, but the fact of the matter is that for most schools a TEFL is pretty unnecessary.  Just remember, people are dropping a half month's salary to take your class, so *please* for the love of the industry don't be a dick and goof around.  It reflects badly on education and foreigners in general.

**What can I expect to get paid in China?**

1.  For education, in Shenzhen, market rate for foreigners is RMB14,000 per month for full time and RMB200 per hour for part time.  I know that in other parts of China the pay is usually less, sometimes dramatically.  Hopefully other people can chime in with different cities.

2.  Outside of education, pay varies but in general you can expect roughly the same salary, often less.  RMB10,000 is a good salary for someone under the age of 30 in China, so there always reaches a point where it makes more sense to hire a local over a foreigner.  That said, for the most part I've always stuck around in education (although I have friends in other industries), so if anyone has anymore information on that front I'm sure it'd be useful.

**I want to get rich in China.  I'm white, if I learn Chinese I should be able to secure a really good salary, right?""**

1.  The media, with all their ""go east young man!"" news stories have lied to you.  First off, know that there exists a whole army of Chinese people (called ""海龟"", or sea turtles), who have spent time studying and/or working abroad and are coming back to China.  They know English, they know how things work in the West, and they know *Chinese*.  Fluently.  Not this bullshit ""I can stutter and mutter for a couple hours to a girl at a bar"", but a native with an actual mastery of the language.  What real advantages do you have over such a person, besides being a white dude? (*hint*: people have companies to run.  Being white matters a lot less than many think it does)  

2.  China, with all of its growth and potential, is at its core still a poor fucking country.  Salaries are just plain not what they are in the OECD.    Sure, locals can get rich here, but it's largely from either proximity to the government-sponsored-fixed-asset-bubble-corruption machine, or from luck.

3.  So how can a foreigner make good money?  First off, you could get an ""expat package"" from a company back in the States - a company is opening a branch in China and needs to lure its employees to transplant themselves halfway across the world, so they give an American salary, plus some.  If that's you, congrats, but you're likely someone with experience who's developed well in a company back in the States, not a young guy looking to develop in China.  Also, from what I've heard, these packages are drying up as companies are increasingly turning to local talent that can actually... get things done in China.

4.  Secondly, you could open your own company.  Most foreigners do this in education, trade, or perhaps a restaurant/bar, as those are the industries that most foreigners have experience in.  Now, note that owning a company is never easy, requires your blood, sweat, and tears, and will quite possibly still fail unless you are lucky.  That's the nature of entrepreneurship.  That said, China has one enormous advantage over the United States - seeing as the financial system is so crazily fucked up (making the bubbly real estate market or a bank account the only investment opportunities for wealthy locals), there's an enormous pool of capital available in China to start your own business. In that sense, it's like Silicon Valley, only not just for tech but all industries. 

**Ok, I'm plateauing as an English teacher and ready to get out of education.  Where next?**

1.  Yep, that's the crap thing about EFL: pay is largely (but not completely) independent of experience, and it's tough to develop professionally in China.  That said, if you stay in China, the choices aren't necessarily phenomenal.  

2.  Firstly, you could make the education --&gt; trade jump.  I've met a number of people who have done this - go to the Western bars, network your ass off, and you should be able to find something entry-level.  Yet be warned: the pay isn't necessarily better than education.

3.  Secondly, you could know Chinese and go work for a Chinese company.  Now, as I alluded to before, you need to *actually* know Chinese (could you read a report in Chinese with minimal frustrations?  Could you participate in a meeting in Chinese?  Could write a tactfully worded email in Chinese?).  If you are actually proficient in Chinese (here's a test: write a cover letter for a job, in Chinese, with no help from the internet or Chinese friends. Then show it to a friend or teacher. How many mistakes did you make?), it's incredibly easy to find a job as a foreigner on 51job or whathaveyou. Companies are sifting through piles of resumes, they get one from a foreigner - they're likely going to call you in for an interview. But be warned: the money isn't necessarily better than teaching.

**Christ, it sounds like you're a downer.  Who pissed in your cereal?**

I know what this might sound like.  But as many Chinese people are quick to note, we've all seen many foreigners who come to China with ""some sort of dream"" and then get disillusioned when they see the reality of it all.  Yes, there's success stories here or there.  Yet this is honestly just why many people end up going back to the States - China can be a lot of work for not that much pay. 

Now, I don't mean to discourage anyone.  Come to China!  It's a wonderful place, filled with great food, hospitable people, and a comfortable standard of living for foreigners.  Explore the world, live abroad - it'll open your eyes and your mind.  But just don't delude yourself into thinking that this place is an easy place to make money just because GDP is growing at a clip of 10% annually.",,False,,t5_2qh2v,1341032741.0,,,True,t3_vttkj,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/vttkj/the_final_post_jobs_in_china_feel_free_to_add/,

about the different phone company and SIM card options available in China, so hopefully it isn't as much of a hassle for non-Chinese speakers and travelers to figure out what they need.

**EDIT** This was not meant to include every single possible phone plan or option available in China. I work for a U.S. mobile phone company, thus I know more about the technology aspect than anything, and that information IS correct. As far as plans go, I simply listed a comparison of the most common ones, yes, other options for plans are available, but the ones listed should suit the vast majority of people. Thanks :)

First off, let's break down the 3 major Chinese mobile phone carriers, starting from the 
largest:

**China Mobile, 中国移动**: By far the largest carrier in China, with an estimated 70 percent market share. You will find at least one China Mobile retailer in every town, village, and backwater
market anywhere in China.

**Coverage**: Basically everywhere/anywhere.

**Network**: 

* 2G GSM Service compatible with any quad-band unlocked phone. 
* 3G service is based on a Chinese-made TD-SCDMA standard, which is not compatible with any phones from outside China. 

**China Unicom, 中国联通**： The second largest carrier in China by market share, and the only one with both a 2G and 3G GSM network based on international standards.

**Coverage**: Unicom has a bit of a bad rap with locals as far as coverage goes, but that mostly
seems to be based on old experiences/loyalty to China Mobile. The bad coverage is no longer the case. 3G coverage now
covers more than 90% of the Chinese population, which basically means you will probably never
go anywhere that you don't have coverage.

**Network**: 

* 2G GSM Service compatible with any quad-band unlocked phone.
* 3G UMTS compatible with any unlocked phone that supports 2100mhz 3G, which covers most modern
smartphones. HSPA+ 21.1 service recently launched in most major cities, which again, just 
requires any 2100mhz smartphone. 

**China Telecom, 中国电信**: The third largest carrier in China by subcribers, using a CDMA network
which is incompatible with most if not all phones purchased outside China.

**Coverage**: About the same 2G coverage as Unicom, with 3G being limited to cities.

**Network**: China Telecom is using variant of North American CDMA technology that adds a SIM
card to the standard. As such, the only phones that will work on China Telecom are phones
that have been specifcally designed for the standard, which will most likely only be sold
in China. 

**Coverage TLDR**; For absolute best coverage, 2G GSM only for non China-Mobile phones,
go with China Mobile. 

For great coverage with 3G service covering 90% of China's population, 
go with China Unicom. (personal recommendation)

If you feel like purchasing a phone that will only be useful in China, go with
China Telecom. Read: No reason to.



**Now, onto the plans**:

**China Mobile**: Basic SIM is a 50RMB prepaid SIM card. 

If used in the same city where purchased, 0.29 RMB/minute for local calls, 0.39 RMB/minute
for long distance. All incoming call free. 

If used outside of the city of purchase, 0.49 RMB/minute for all outgoing calls in China,
and 0.39 RMB/minute for incoming calls.

To buy: Any China Mobile/mobile phone shop. Write down ""50RMB SIM"", and they will know what
you are talking about. 


**China Unicom**: Basic 3G Voice/Data SIM, 66RMB/monthly prepaid. Billed the same regardless of 
where you are or where you are calling in China.

66RMB/month buys you 50 minutes of outgoing calls, 240 outgoing SMS, and 300MB of 3G data.
Incoming calls and SMS are free.

Additional outgoing calls are 0.2 RMB/minute anywhere in China. 

Additional data is billed at .3 RMB/MB, or 30RMB per 100MBs. This is deducted from whatever
balance you have loaded onto the SIM card. 

To buy: Any China Unicom shop, many mobile phone stores/vendors. Ask for ""3G Plan A, 66RMB"".
If you go to an official China Unicom store, usually someone will speak English, or just 
point to the brochure where it lists ""3G Plan A, 66RMB"". 

**China Telecom**: Don't know, don't care, as you need to buy a phone
specifically designed for the standard, and their doesn't seem to be a convincing reason to.

**TLDR**; China Unicom is generally cheaper, just as reliable, and includes 3G data. Personal recommendation from a few years of use all around China.

To alleviate this I wrapped myself in two massive layers of duvet and an electric bar heater. Turns out, the latter was not a good idea.

I woke up suddenly coughing, and discovered the duvet smoking more than an Amsterdam cafe. Opened the windows, turned off the heater and figured everything was A-OK. Went for a shower and checked my email. Next thing I see when I open my bedroom door is a massive meter-high fireball has already consumed my double bed, taking my Kindle and brand-new iPhone with it. When I close my eyes I still see the unbelievable flames. It's when your thrust into this kind of situation you realise there are absolutely no smoke detectors, or sprinklers, or even a fucking fire extinguisher. Although by that point it was raging out of control anyway.

Long(er) story short and a month later after Spring Festival I'm told that the local fire department has ruled it ""not an accident"", and therefore I am liable for all fire damage - which, to be succinct - is extensive.

To pay this back I'm going to have to give up half my salary. The owners are clearly trying to milk this. According to the inventory, they're charging me for stuff that's not damaged, and in some cases for stuff I have already replaced (like bedding). 6000RMB for a new bed? 5000RMB for ""compensation""? I could get no extension on what that means.

So basically, I'm looking for some pretty serious advice here. I am incredibly tempted to just run for the hills, cross the border to HK and never look back. How much of that makes me a total asshole? Oh, I have no Foreign Expert's Certificate, Residence Permit or even a Z-Visa - the agency just made me buy a new Tourist visa in HK. Still haven't been paid back for that. Whole other story.

EDIT 28-02: Thank you for all comments and solid advice. Overwhelmed but taking in every word. Just been informed by my agency I have to move out the apartment tomorrow into a hotel on my own expense for *at least* a month.

Shangrao in Jiangxi by way of Shanghai to be specific. Anyway, I’m at the hotel restaurant in Shangrao when one of the female staff gets friendy, comes and sits with me and has a quick beer during her shift. 


She says she wants to practice her English (I live in Japan so have had many experiences with English leeches) so can she come to my room after she finishes work. I said sure, thinking she could be genuine, maybe she wants some of my two minute special action or perhaps she wants to drug me and steal my valuables.

  
Around 9pm she arrives at my room still dressed in her waitress uniform and I am thinking this could be my first real porno experience. “Room Service” “Maid in China” “I’m Here to Collect your Laundry” . I digress. We get to chatting for about half an hour and she tells me she wants to marry an Englishman. I’m thinking hold on there pet I don’t even know your name. She tells me her name. I still don’t know it. 

She gets a phone call and says she has to go out with her friends drinking so I think none of it and say goodbye. I was fucking knackered so I went to bed (had a wank). 


Around 1am she turns up at my hotel room again, ringing on the doorbell for what seemed like a good two minutes before I realised where I was and what the fuck was going on.  When I answered the door, she was stood there crying saying she had a terrible time and could she come in. Wahey! Here we go I thought, shoulder to cry on and all that, good job I had that wank.  


From this point on she would only communicate in writing via the hotel room notepad. Thusly, “You are handsome. You can regard me as air. Please go to sleep”. Now as you can imagine, going to sleep was the last thing I wanted to do now, if only through fear of getting murdered or ripped off. I said no it’s ok, I don’t need to sleep (one eye open, drool stringing down my chin), why don’t we just have a chat. Still hoping for a shag like. Takes more than the possibility of her being an insane murderer to put ol' Professor_Fuck off. 


After standing at the foot of my bed for 5-10 minutes, she writes me another note. “You are very handsome. You have nice feet. Goodbye”. She then proceeds to help herself to the two bottles of complimentary water, one of my pillows and promptly leaves. 

I love China. 

Has anyone had any similar experiences? Thoughts?

Now I don't know the Chinese equivalent, because he told me this in English, but if you do know, please let me know.

I've complied a list of stereotypes of people by province. I've been told that many of these are politically incorrect, but I think we can look beyond that. 

Feel free to edit or add to these. I'm doing this for my own knowledge, not to showcase my own.

Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning: Blue Collared workers who have a strict mentality. They tend to keep to themselves and get their work done.

Hebei: ???

Beijing: I personally have the tendency to think people here are very strict, in-line with the communist party. I'm not sure if it's because it's the capital, or if its true.

Tianijin: ??

Henan: They will try to trick you and swindle you. This one came from someone I know from Henan, he mentioned it so non-nonchalantly. When I later asked another girl from Shanxi, she was like ""SHHH, we never speak of this...but yes, this is our stereotype"" 

Shandong: Smart

Shanxi: Frugal 

Shaanxi: Historical

Hubei: ???

Hunan: ???

Jiangsu: ???

Anhui: Full of businessmen

Shanghai: Cocky mean people. Manipulative women and rich men.

Zhejiang: ????

Jiangxi: ???

Fujian: ??? 

Guangdong: Rich

Guangxi: ???

Hainan: ??

Yunnan: full of people from different ethnic groups (i.e. not Han Chinese)

Guizhou: ???

Chongqing: ??? (same as Sichaun?)

Sichuan: Hot girls and spicy food

Gansu:???

Qinghai: ???

Ningxia: ??

Nei Mongu: Strong Farmer's boys

Hong Kong: Hates mainlanders, kinda.

Macau: Gambling

Tibet, Xinjiang: Want to be free from China

Taiwan: Doesn't consider themselves to be from China.

Being of the ""Taiwanese side"" I would also like to hear your argument if you think Taiwan is a part of China. I don't want to argue with you, I want your opinion. I know opinions vary a lot, even among Mainland Chinese.
I live in the US, and despite being born and raised here, I interact with a lot of ""FOBs"", thus am not completely ignorant of what goes on in China. Most of my friends are straight from Taiwan, and I additionally know many Mainland Chinese: and know people from about half of these provinces. I just hadn't have the chance to ask all of them, as I didn't really think about this until last night.

Yesterday we went to the Forbidden City, etc., and then went to the Wangfujing street food markets.

We all know about the tea shop scam (we got approached four times yesterday) but there appears to be a new street food scam. Or at least, it's new to me, so it may be new to some of you too!

It goes like this:

* I ask how much the dumplings/whatever cost.
* Seller points to a sign behind him with prices listed like 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 15 yuan. Basically, cheap prices.
* I tell him I want these dumplings and he puts a sauce or whatever on them and hands them to me.
* I hand over 20 yuan.
* Seller tells me the price is 50 yuan. Obviously this is bullshit so a mini argument begins.
* During the argument people who clearly work for stall/market start buying the exact thing I ordered (but don't get a topping so the food can be reused) and do a terrible acting job to make sure I see them paying 50 yuan and that 50 yuan is the normal price.
* Seller gets very aggressive. I speak a bit of Chinese, explain I am not a tourist, and start ringing the police. They back down and charge what money had been handed over (my confused/worried brother had given them 30 at this stage). As I live here obviously I am used to this sort of shite so knew how to deal with them, but I would imagine most tourists would be intimidated into paying the 50 yuan.
* Two out of the three stalls we bought food from tried this scam.

As I said, I don't know if this is a new scam, but please warn your family and friends if they are visiting Beijing.",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,t3_zi114,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/zi114/scam_at_wangfujing_street_food_market/,

- Me and three laowai friends decided to hike one of the hills behind where I live. None of us retards thought about bringing water, so when we reached the top we were all pretty parched. Thankfully, there were a few Chinese people up there, who climbed all the way with their Jeeps and even set up a little tent, and after asking politely they gave us some water. Of course, they insisted to give us two large bottles, not just one, and refused payment. 

As you all know, Chinese generosity is awesome, and quite unmatched. So what *really* surprised me is what followed: they started packing, and one of them pulled out a large plastic bag, put on surgical gloves, and started picking up some of the trash left by previous visitors. His little kid was also running around, saying 垃圾！垃圾！and enthusiastically retrieving some pieces of rubbish from the bushes. That kid rocks. 

- I went to the bank to do a money transfer. I braced myself for an afternoon of waiting punctuated by the dumbest bullshit, like every time I have the misfortune of setting foot inside a Chinese bank. But no. I walked in there, the security lady talked to me like a real person, helped me fill out the forms, and when it was my turn (I was second in line), the girl behind the glass stood up. I thought she was going to hide in the back, but no, she stood up to bow to me! Startled a bit, I clumsily bowed back, then proceeded with the transaction. It was a bit slow, of course, but she did what she had to do competently, then stood up and bowed again. I thought I had been teleported to fucking Japan or something, but no, I went back outside, and was still in the same Chinese cow town.

- And just now, I came back from town on my bike. There is one intersection I have to go through that is a bit tricky, as there are no traffic lights, is surrounded by trees that block the vision, is right after a curve on one side, and is really fucking dark. I started going through, and out of the side with a curve comes a taxi, going at 400 km/h. I hit the brakes, knowing damn well he won't stop, but he actually did, and yielded the way.

I don't know if there's been a lot of discussion about this, but I looked around this thread, and some relationship ones, and couldn't find it. I'm 29, female, African American, and living in a Changsha in China. I've been here for about 3 years. My Mandarin is poor to middling. 

Full disclosure: I'm am overweight, but I am working on that. I've lost about 40 lbs since I came here, and am still working out several times a week, butenoughaboutthat...

I want a Chinese boyfriend. I definitely have a thing for Chinese guys, and I would love to end up with one. But a few things are standing in my way. 1) I don't go out much, I don't drink or go bar hopping, and I don't know that many available guys my age. 2) This year I may be leaving China for a while, and once I come back I'll have a job that's going to require that I (and my SO) move every few years. But, I want to give it a try.

I know most of you are guys, and it's possible that you have Chinese guy friends (if you're living over here). So, I'm throwing myself at your mercy. Other than 1) Getting in better shape and 2) Learning more Mandarin, what can I do to be more active in finding a bf? Being an American, and speaking English makes me a bit more popular, but being black doesn't help.

I just figure out of over half a billion people I should be able to find someone.

Trying to make sense of the Diaoyu",Hopfrogg,63,6,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1000g4/potsdam_cairo_san_fran_taipei_trying_to_make/,"Thought I would post some documents for people interested in learning more about the Diaoyu Islands controversy.

In 1943 during the continuing conflict with Japan in WWII, the Pacific Allies (President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, President Chiang Kai-shek) issued the [Cairo Declaration](http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/shiryo/01/002_46/002_46tx.html) which basically stated that the three allies agreed to stop Japanese aggression and that all lands taken by Japan from China during the war, would be returned to China.

Following the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan agreed to surrender under the conditions of the [Potsdam Declaration](http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/etc/c06.html). This declaration created in cooperation with the US, UK, and China defined that ""Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine."". Pretty vague with what appears to be a cya disclaimer at the end. 

Later, without the involvement of China, the [San Francisco Peace Treaty](http://www.taiwandocuments.org/sanfrancisco01.htm) was entered into by the US and Japan. This treaty, in Article 3, appears to give the US the authority to administer the area that the Diaoyu are located.

China would also enter in a peace treaty with Japan a year later, [The Treaty of Taipei](http://www.taiwandocuments.org/taipei01.htm). This document has Japan relinquishing several territorial claims and islands, but nowhere is the Diaoyu or its location mentioned.

Just putting those out there for people who might be interested in learning more about this. What follows are my own opinions and questions.

The U.S. clearly agreed that all territories taken by Japan during WWII would be returned to China and if the Diaoyu were indeed China's prior to WWII, then the U.S. has no ground to enter a treaty, without China, in which it would control any territory that previously belonged to China. So from my perspective, it's quite simple. Under whose sovereignty was the Diaoyu prior to WWII and here is where it gets tricky.

From what I gather both cultures identify the islands on their maps going back hundreds of years, but the pertinent information per the treaties and agreements made, is who owned the islands prior to WWII?

The Japanese government annexed the islands in 1895. Is there any formal denouncement or contention made from China? From 1900 to 1940 a Japanese fishing company operated a processing facility there with 200 workers. If this was Chinese territory, exactly why would this be allowed to happen?

Going back to Potsdam. Did the allies ever ""determine"" that the Diaoyu were among those ""minor islands"" to be part of Japanese sovereignty? If not, then Japan's sovereignty seems pretty defined by the treaty and an omission is not an assignment of ownership. It's a disclaimer allowing for future definition of sovereignty which doesn't seem to have ever defined the Diaoyu as Japan territory.

Confusing and would appreciate any further insight with supporting links/documentation instead of just opinion. On the one hand I can see Japan making a claim that it was not a territory taken by force during the War and as such they have no reason to relinquish it per the declarations. On the other hand, the treaties and declarations (the ones in which the Chinese agreed), clearly defined Japanese sovereignty and the Diaoyu are not part of it. I don't see how the U.S. is entitled to later agree to administer the islands in an agreement with Japan, when they previously agreed to define Japanese sovereignty with China and it did not include the Diaoyu.

I'm an Australian born Chinese, who has been in China for half an year already, taking a year off from university.

I have previously been to China numerous times throughout my life, 19 now and this would be my 12th time here. The trip before were just for the Spring festival to see relatives and only lasted for at most two weeks. This time, things have really opened up my eyes.

Double standards is a thing I'm beginning to cope with. Firstly would be language. My Mandarin is fluent, as in nearly local fluent, this is because my family in Australia can barely speak English so I grew up speaking Mandarin. My English is still better but locals cannot decipher if I was born overseas until they see the way I dress and do things. That's great really so I thought people in China would accept me easier, but it turns out being overseas Chinese entitles you to a life of purgatory here. If I was to make one single grammatical mistake or spelling error using Chinese, something simple that even locals get wrong, they will rib it on me for days. Hm, well that's a double standard for locals and me I guess, another problem is probably my own jealousy. My laowai friends speak completely broken Chinese and they love him for it. I'm usually fine with that, Chinese is a hard language.

Pay and employment, perhaps this is down to jealousy or not. I know I have no degree and only a high school diploma and a few other certificates that are not really of note so I cannot be asking for much. I have experience, having tutored ESL kids for many years in Australia and also used to translate important documents for pretty big companies (family relations). Bear with me though, I've been working as a translator and English Teacher around Beijing. Living on the usual 3000-4000 a local Chinese earns. I see similar unqualified people from Europe, not even from a English speaking country such as Russia, getting paid 10 000 a month. In fact I was a recruiter for a English company for a while, the interviews made me cringe, here I was interviewing someone for a position that is better than mine, when I am the one more suited for it. Most of these non-English foreign expats can speak English but not well enough to have a good conversation or write an essay. After a dozen of these, I quit that job. It's because they were white, the parents want someone that is white. This just keeps drumming in my head, I'm not wanted in this country. 

I posted a while ago on here, about a domestic abuse case about my neighbours. One thing the male abuser said was ""你觉得你变了国籍，就能欺负我了?"" ""You think you change your nationality and you can bully me?"" (Despite the fact, he was the bully) This kind of sums up what I think Chinese locals think of me. A Chinese pom, like a guy who thinks he is better than everyone because he is of another nationality now. I know why, many Chinese leave the country and get foreign nationalities and come back proud. Except, I've never done anything proud. I tell everyone I'm a Huaren and I have read the classic Chinese texts, know my dynasties off by heart, studied countless hours of Chinese history and even go to karaoke and other events mainly locals enjoy. Everywhere I go, if I speak English to a laowai friend, people will have second thoughts about me. The fact I'm Chinese and I'm a politics major, people think I'm stupid. 

A common situation that arises when I teach English is the student I have, will generally be concerned by my standard of English is not up to scratch. For instance with the word 'theatre' one of them accused me of faking my English. This is because in American English, it is 'theater'. Not matter, how much I explain that in Australian and British English it was different, they just assumed I was lying that I knew English since their previous 'laowai' teacher from Ukraine taught them otherwise. The other thing they always say is ""My REAL laowai teacher told me this, or why do you charge SO much when you are a Chinese second language learner?"" I charge 50-100 a hour...This isn't a matter of being right and wrong, this just causes identity problems within me. What am I? 

I quit my first translation job because i was getting 4000 a month compared to the 5000 another guy was getting. Difference was, I had to come in every single weekday, he just had to come in once a week.

Going on, a night out in Wudaokou or Sanlitun can go good or bad. Depending on the crowd really. Sometimes I can hook up or other times I just get rejected. I'm fine with that, it's the same in Melbourne and everywhere else. The major problem is, my laowai friends can always pick up on the girl that rejected me. Every single time nearly, perhaps Vics isn't the best place. I must either be the total opposite in terms of a guy to my laowai friends or there's some type if innate racism within these girls. I always try to use Occam's Razor and think of the simplest explanation but once this happens so much, that statistically, the complicated explanation makes more sense, you get a real pain in your chest, knowing that girls from your own ethnicity are not interested in you. 

There are of course, awesome people and not so awesome people everywhere. Many of my students really appreciate the hard work I put in and my ability to explain classes bilingually. Some Chinese love it and understand that I have tried my best to understand China. 

Just putting my story out there, I'm coping fine, I'm helping out with the unfortunate during Spring Festival still. Celebrating with the relatives that look down on me. It's really depressing but life goes on and shit happens. I actually prefer getting called 'small dick' and 'no eyes' calls in High School. Those people are kidding at least...I think, haha. 

TL;DR  

Overseas Chinese guy finds out that in China, he isn't constituted as a Chinese nor a foreigner but something in between. He has identity crisis.

Yes they are uncouth, uneducated and uncool. But if you get to know them you will realize that a lot of those guys have hearts of gold and a sense of justice and equality that is entirely lacking in some other parts of Chinese society. 
 
The bulk of the waidiren workforce are men aged 45-60. These guys have been through shit that none of us can know. Stuck at the bottom of a harsh ladder, their education prospects and dreams pulled out from under their feet during the cultural revolution, their backs and hands exploited ever since. 

They are uncouth because they were cheated out of their chance at self improvement when Mao shut down all the schools.  
  
I know it ruins your day when a dirty labourer is standing, like, right in front of your window at starbucks, but seriously, get the fuck over it. They are the poor saps upon whose backs the wealth of this country is being built, show them a little respect.  

  Everyone should try to spend a few days chatting to these guys and trying to understand how they view the world. It would be good for them and good for us.  
 
Edit: To qualify this post, I should say that my main meaning was migrant workers. I probably should have just used migrant workers from the start. 
  
I think that foreigners are generally quite relaxed about migrant workers but still I see a lot of negative attitudes towards them, or misunderstandings. This post was also directed at the Chinese people on this board though. I am pretty tired of hearing moneyed Chinese people bitching about the peasants that built their houses and roads, especially those rich people who are rich only because labour costs are so low. 
 
A lot of people are having a go at me because this is apparently a ""meta"" post. This is not meta. I will happily admit that my post the other day ""Scumis has been here so long..."" was ""meta"", but I think most people here also thought it was amusing. I used scumis as a point of reference because he is kind of the epitome of the jaded ""lifer"" these days. I should point out that I did not remove Scumis' drunken rant, and I am not going to say who did. I will say that I completely understand the reason for the removal. That post was 110% chinacirclejerk material. Nobody who reads the post will disagree.

First of all, I want to say that I share your general sentiment on the subject. That said, as parents of a 1 year old, we often find ourselves out of other options. Yes, my wife is of farmer stock so to her it's perfectly fine -although she does go behind a tree or something with our son on my recomendation now. Our kid wears a diaper most of the time of course but my wife tries to limit it as much as possible, which is often a source of heated arguments between us. 

I wonder though, in 6 months or so when he's trained and won't be wearing a diaper anymore, what can we do? I'm thinking hard where there's a public restroom anywhere we usually go, but right now I can't think of any. Where we lived before, I can remember 2 but they were both so unbelievably dirty and covered in urine and a foul stench that I'd only ever go in there again if my life depended on it. There aren't any McDs or KFCs around here so that's out, and virtually none of the shops or small restaurants have bathrooms (at least not any where customers are allowed into) so what's left if you have a 3 year old dying to go? The truth is, there isn't anything you can do apart from jumping into your car and speeding home, something that's definitely not an option for most Chinese parents. 

It's an accepted practice for many Chinese and I can understand why you (childless) expats hate it since I feel the same way, but we're clearly lacking viable alternatives. ",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,t3_yp5b7,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/yp5b7/as_a_father_in_china/,

1354719395.0,48,self.China,14bofc,Responses from my granddad,mkdz,55,7,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/14bofc/responses_from_my_granddad/,"&gt;My question is: In the film Xi'an was the 'safe haven', did your Grandfather try to go there or somewhere else? How did he travel?

In 1942 he attended昆阳中学 until when he graduated in 1944. Before he could take finals, the Japanese invaded so he fled to 内乡河南西北. At the time, 安阳高中 had fled to 内乡 so he enrolled in that school. 

In March 1945 Japanese invaded Western 河南, so he followed his high school as it fled towards 陕西. 西北中学 was a school in 西安, 陕西 that was opened by 河南 people. He lived there temporarily. In August, the Japanese surrendered, so the school moved back to 安阳. He said he had walked everywhere at this point. In reality, he only had about 2-3 months of school in 1945 because of all the movement.

When he went back to 河南, he decided to go back home. When the school opened, he went back to school in beginning of 1946 after New Year’s. 安阳高中 location in安阳 was the old home of 袁世凯’s north of the city walls itself called 垣上村. There was a Nationalist Airport behind the school. 袁世凯 was also buried there. Currently, it’s the site of a museum.

Around March of 1947, the Communists surrounded安阳. The school fled into the city inside the city walls. They stopped having classes because of the constant fighting and gunfire. The railroad was cut off; there was no transportation, no postal service, and no communication. 

Around June 1947, the Communists left. They never got into the city. They started using the airport by the school to send supplies to the city. They started shipping out students on the return flights out of the city. They flew him to 新乡 then he went home. 

All the colleges had already found students, so he couldn’t go to college again. So he went to 开封 to retake class so he can go to college next year. In March 1948, the Communists attacked开封. This time, they actually invaded the city so he left in June. The Communists retreated in July-August and then the Nationalists came back. He went back to check to see if school would start up again in August, but he couldn’t find anything. He met an elementary school friend while walking on the street and they decided they would go to 南京 to go to another school opened by Nationalists.

&gt;Can you find out what his feelings were, and what other people at the time thought about the change of power from the Nationalists to the CCP?

&gt;Was there ever any ideological basis for your grandfather's joining the Party?

In early 1949, the Nationalists left南京. At this point the students needed to decide if he wanted to flee with the Nationalists or go with the Communists. He along with nine other students decided that they would try and find a school started by the Communists because they were sick of trying to stay in school with the Nationalists. All they really wanted to do was just go to college. So they decided to go back to河南 to try and find a Communist school.

When they got back to河南, the Communists wanted them to join the army. In the end two of them went to military, two went home to see their family, and the other six went to 开封 to find a school. They found a 中原大学 in 开封, but they didn’t think it was good enough. They also found that in 徐州 to the east of Kaifeng there was a school that would offer an associate degree. They decided that this was better than nothing so they wanted to go there. Before they went to徐州, they went to the education department in开封 to talk to an old teacher of theirs that ended up being the head of the education department. He said to not to go to the school offering the associate degree. The Communist Party needed people to work for the government and 中原大学 was the best choice for that. So they decided to enroll and started on March 12. He said he was there for six months and all he learned about was Communist ideology. He said he took everything with a grain of salt, and just wrote what the teachers wanted to hear so he could graduate and get a job. He said there were two things they learned none of the students believed: the Nationalists didn’t fight the Japanese and the Japanese surrendered because of Communists fighting for 8 years not because of atomic bombs or Soviets. 

&gt;How did he end up in the Mayor position, what was the power struggle like to get into those positions?

After he graduated from this “college”, the Communists sent him to 长沙. At first, he was assigned to the south district for a while. Apparently he could get stuff done really fast and independently. His superiors trusted him a lot. Eventually they made him vice-mayor of the North District. I want to be clear, he was not vice-mayor or mayor of the city. He was vice-mayor and mayor of a district in the city. 长沙 at the time had something like eight districts. He was appointed to his position by the Communist party head of长沙. He said at the time, there wasn’t a whole lot of corruption or power plays compared to now and they would crack down on it pretty hard. He said he remembered the 天津 mayor got executed because of corruption. 

&gt;My question is, if he had no ideological reason for joining the party, if he knew that the over reporting of grain figures was killing peasants, and if he was happy to sit back and take pay checks from the state coffers to do nothing, is there any chance that he was part of the problem, not part of the solution, and would he still feel resentful if he was on the gravy train right now, or would he be happy to ride it all the way?
Does he ever feel guilty about his part in all of the above?

&gt;What was it like to be a vice-major during the Cultural revolution? I mean was he scared during that time? And what was the '' purging '' like? Just an order from Beijing or more like a violent replacement?

He was mayor in the city so he never oversaw any farms. At the time, the farmers would send their allotments of grain to the party and then the party would redistribute it. Everybody in the city had food rations since they didn’t actually produce any food. Everybody knew that the rural leaders were lying about the production, but there wasn’t anything anybody could do about it. He oversaw a bunch of factories in his district and he said that most of the factory leaders gave him false reports about factory output as well. He said he couldn’t really do anything about that either because he couldn’t get rid of all of the factory managers. 

In the late 50s, the Chinese Defense Minister 彭德怀 toured the country to see how the GLF was doing. He realized that it was not going well and started criticizing it and trying to stop it. Eventually, 毛 removed him from his post and put him in jail where he died in 1974.

At the time, the party instituted a policy that intellectuals were counter-revolutionary and farmers were the most politically correct. The party said everybody needs to learn from the farmers. A lot of his former classmates were purged because of this. They were removed from their posts and sent to the country side to farm or sent into a factory to work there. He said one guy was purged because he praised American toothbrushes. Eventually he was purged as well. He said one day they just shut his entire office down and sent everybody to the labor camps. Officially, he was at the camp for 17 months. However, he was good friends with a doctor and had him write notes that said he was too sick to work so that every few months he could come back to 长沙for a couple months at a time.

If he wasn’t purged, he doubts he could have advanced. The government wanted non-intellectuals to be in power. His resentment is more from the lack of respect for intellectuals and the GLF and the Cultural Revolution. 

&gt;According to western history books, up to 30 million people died in the GLP while a 1 million died in 1942 (yet the Chinese government allows a film about the latter but not the first). How did he perceive this? Which was worse where he was?

He said that the GLF was worse overall for the country than the famine. He said in WWII, if you were in Japanese occupied areas, it really sucked, but if you were outside those areas, you were ok. In the GLF, everybody was suffering.

&gt;Was wondering what type of impact does he feel the famine in Henan and The Great Leap Forward had on the mentality of the Chinese people. Does he feel the famines may have played a role in the money obsessed mentality associated with modern Chinese?

&gt;Was wondering, if he could describe how both of these events impacted Chinese society, and if there is one or the other that had a greater impact on Chinese culture/mentality?

&gt; Can you ask him what long-term impact the famine period and the GLF had on his personality and his general outlook on life? Also you mention that he feels disdain towards the CCP relating to the rampant corruption that exists. With his insider knowledge it would therefore be interesting to hear his opinion on how corruption will hold back future political reform in China. Thanks for this opportunity.

He said the GLF and the Cultural Revolution created a big distrust of the government and party. The government would say things, and they would have to follow because there was nothing else they could do. They had to take the government’s word for everything, but it all ended up being lies so eventually everybody just didn’t trust the government. He thinks that the materialism and lack of politeness is a result of being poor and the lack of education. In the village he’s from, there were around 300 people and only about ten of them received higher than an elementary school education.

He thinks corruption is the biggest issue facing China and if there was more than one party, the Communists would be kicked out of power. He’s optimistic about习近平 because in his address to the country he also said corruption is the main thing holding back China.

1334767799.0,50,self.China,sg8uc,So I got into a pretty dangerous situation in Beijing,gusenbauer,57,7,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/sg8uc/so_i_got_into_a_pretty_dangerous_situation_in/,"I came to China 6 weeks ago and was working most of the time, so I didn't do any sightseeing until last week.
I had a day off, so a rumanian friend of mine and I decided to visit the forbidden city.

On our way home we approached two ""students"" asking a russian girl to go to a tea house with them. I know the language a little bit, so I explained to her what was going on and that the friendly guys are just trying to pull a scam.

We walked away, still talking russian, but the guys followed us and didn't stop to invite her to come with them. I told them the girl was with us and that we are going to leave now. A few steps farther we started to introduce ourself to the russian girl, the chinese guys saw that and realized I wasn't telling the truth.

They ran towards us and pushed me from behind. One of them screamed at me cholericly, asking me what I told her. I said that i told her about the tea house scam and that I know that they are just trying to get money out if this naive girl.

They continued to push me and screaming that it's none of my business. I didn't swallow this and pushed back, starting to scream and curse myself. One of the guys said I didn't know who I was dealing with, I answered that they don't know who they're dealing with and was prepared to fight those bastards.

I told the girl to leave and that we are going to do the same, when she's gone, but she was just standing there, obviously not understanding what was going on.
They said that I will not leave and that I'm in big trouble now. After a phonecall from one of those guys a few more of their friends showed up and surrounded me.
My friend tried to intervene, but they pushed him away, telling him to get the fuck out and that they only want to deal with me.

In the end I was surrounded by 6 guys and one of them pulled a knife out. At first they wanted money and tried to put their hands in my pockets. I pushed them away and just said that I don't have money anyways and that my cellphone is pretty crappy too.
The guy who pushed me at first said he didn't even want my money, all he wants is to kill me now. I don't know how serious he or this situation were, but I was really scared at that moment.
I managed to squeeze out of the ring of thugs and started walking away with my friend. They continued to run behind us kicking me, but stopped when we approached the next big street crossing.

Oh and yes, the girl run away, as things became really heated. We saw her on the other side of the road, walking towards her hotel, I guess.
Not sure if she still didn't understand the situation, but she saw us and didn't feel the urge to talk nor thank us...

The average is about 18k/month when removing outliers.

Range is 2,500 to 300,000 per month. 

Teaching ranges from 6,000-24,000. I think this is pretty representative of pay ranging from universities to international schools.

White collar ranges from 2,500 (intern) or 6,000 (F/T) to 200/300k.

IT and Creative industries are most popular according to the data.

Same old story...
What's not normal to me is her mother/family, who I still have to meet. 

The cut and thrust of it is, ever since she told them about me over a year and a half ago, they flat out refused to meet me. Because I don't have any assets as such. No house etc.

So until I could afford the down-payment (100k) on a house in this city, they would not give their blessing. Of course my girlfriend listens to them.

A lot of saving later, using my emergency savings, and borrowing from everyone I could I'm close to getting the deposit money ready. We were checking out some places, and she hit me with it that the house needs to be in HER name, not mine.

I work hard as an English teacher doing 50+ hour weeks and earning not much more than 14k a month (the wages are pretty low - 3rd tier city) So I'm just worried about what will happen in the future if I need to pick myself up from nothing. Her parents have money, apparently, so its not like theyre looking to move in. Dunno why this is so complicated

Advice please... thanks guys




Edit: Thanks for all the replies. Good and bad. I should probably add that this isn't the best city, but I've been here a while I don't exactly want to live in this city (let alone buy a house).

Just a brief and overwhelmingly appreciative note to say thanks to everyone who has subscribed to this sub.

* January, 2012: 3,000
* April, 2012: 4,000
* June, 2012: 5,000

However sometimes the lack of personal connections really starts to grate on me. Customer service mentality is not the same here as in Australia, and being ignored by people (or the other extreme, being treated as a tourist attraction) can be difficult to cope with. 

What keeps me sane is that every day as I head out of my apartment at 6:50 am, a man in my building is returning with his granddaughter in his arms. He and I always exchange a smile, a nod or a ""ni hao"". Just this basic act of recognition, of connection with someone I don't even know the name of puts a smile on my face.

Fubar is what he refers to as his ""baby""--from decor to drink menu, the vision was all his. 

Like many foreigners who open businesses in China, he opened with Chinese owners; he and his Chinese wife being part owners, with two other Chinese people.

Well, fubar's Chinese owners have just decided that they don't need the laowai anymore; Chad built it up, built the clientele, made it into a popular venue, and now they don't need him anymore.

Chad knew they were trying to push him out but remained firm until earlier in the week they accused him of stealing money and effectively pushed he and his wife out of the business.

Anyone who knows Chad knows that he's a trusting, trustworthy person, which unfortunately in Chinese business are flaws. He has very little legal recourse since he cannot afford a good lawyer (he realized the irony in being accused of stealing cash and not actually having the money for a lawyer), so basically Fubar as we knew it under Chad is over.

The Chinese owners hired six thugs to sit around the bar making sure he doesn't come in, and had his foreign bar staff all fired. 


So Fubar has gone the way of Kro's nest (the same thing happened and the old Kro's outlets now go by Tube Station). Except in Fubar's case, Chad WAS on the contract, hence being accused of stealing rather then just being pushed out like Kro was.



What I'm asking is to please tell your friends what has happened. Anyone who will listen.

Sitting with Chad last night and hearing him tell the story was heartbreaking...and a big reminder to everyone to protect yourselves and not be too trusting in your places of work.

 Though I did something every stupid to screw everything up. 

But from my sad and short romance I found American girls have a fasinating and independent personality which attracts me very much. I don't mean I've made up my mind to find an American wife and I probably don't have a chance to know an American girl in my real life.  But somehow look forward it. However I am a little nervous and unconfident about myself. I want to know if I had chance to improve myself into someone who would attract an American girl which direction should I go?

What I would like to know is what you expect from a boyfriend or husband. 

EDIT: I forgot to ask one important thing. How and where could I get to know an American girl? Moving to USA is a way....But I don't feel like to move there. So how and where could I get to know an American girl in China? I had never and probably will never go to a bar or club or something....I am already out of school and college. 

Thank you all.

Appearance? Body fitness? Personality? Please tell me. Thanks very much....

Oh please tell what I should avoid if I would like to date an American girl. I always goes the wrong way in relationship I guess...

I filled in some of the Google &lt;&gt; Baidu counterparts. Rest of the Chinese wangluo is uncharted territory for me. I feel pretty giddy about this whole thing, I hope you are as excited.

EDIT: this is what the [Baidu Browser](http://i.imgur.com/pqigN6e.jpg) looks like! That UI font is horribly small.

EDIT2: put more links to the list, karma for everyone ITT! keep it up. also for 4chan equivalent I'm looking for a genuine large traditional 2ch-style imageboard and that's all there is to it. Vimeo is also simple: video site with 99% quality OC by small independents and communities.

EDIT3: ditched that horrible Baidu browser and trying 360 later. Using [Opera](http://i.imgur.com/k0FG7qA.jpg) in the meanwhile because it allows easy search engine and localization changes. As a additional bonus Chinese font looks really crisp and legible in that one, compared to the bit fuzzy Chrome has.

EDIT4: 360 is horrible and demands system locale to be changed to chinese. Not as bad as Baidu Browser, but still bad. I strongly suggest using **Opera** as mentioned before. Opera also has this bookmark alias feature: set alias ""reddit"" for mop.com and then every time you type ""reddit"" in address bad it goes to mop instead! Nice. Added more links. **Douban** is raising questions. What exactly is it? Nobody has yet suggested comprehensive sports site like ESPN.

One of the interesting things is that there has always been this dynamic where barbarians come into the kingdom and very quickly assimilate into the society and become ""Chinese"". It worked for the Mongols, the Manchus and many Western tribes who maintained their religion and some ethnic identity but assimilated almost completely in other ways.  
 
As scumis joins the lofty ranks of the mod team here, I wonder if anyone has seen the analogy. Scumis is the barbarian who stormed these boards about a year ago and claimed them as his own. At first his rage was murderous and his greed for power insatiable, but over time he assimilated into the board and became (in some ways) a normal contributor. With his elevation to mod status, I wonder if he will become even more normal, maybe stop chugging erguotou every day, stop professing his love for Riceagain, maybe stop  calling people faggot.  
 
Keep in mind, I am not betting on this outcome, just commenting on an interesting sociological experiment in action.

To be fair, thought I did the same about Natives like all Objibwe folks back home had teepees and smoking pipes.  Anyhoo, there was once when my Chinese roommate fucking pissed the shit out of me... something annoyingly irritable.  The guy would bring his gf over and literally have sex with her with the door open and she'd make sheep-like bleats and shrieks... and being the nice guy that I am, I would close my door and act as if it didn't happen.  You know, common sense.  I had hoped they noticed they let the door open and feel all salty, but nope... weeks of this.  Anyhoo, I was ripe with revenge and used his stereotypes of Miao people against him.  I poured table salt in a line outside his door and made knots out of toilet paper and hung it on his door knob.  Then I arranged this impromptu altar on the kitchen table, it was made from junk knick knack gifts I got from hawkers and lit a candle of left it there.  After all of that was set, I waited in my room and soon enough the sheep GF made a ""Whaaaaaaahhhh!"" and closed the door.  The roommate opened up came up to me and asked me if I did it.  I told him ""Yes, I noticed that everytime your girlfriend comes over, there is a spirit following her.  It likes to stand over her when shes eating and I notice it stands between you two.  I did that 'spell' to keep it away from you.""   Needless to say, the roommate's conjugal visits were minimal since.

http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/20/lenovo-ceo-spreads-the-wealth/

By Terrence O'Brien

The list of CEOs and other execs in the US that have accepted multi-million dollar bonuses for lording over the crash and burn of a company (or even an entire economy) is staggering. And we can guarantee you that most of that money went towards fancy cars and golden toilet seats. Lenovo's Yang Yuanqing, on the other hand, received a sizable $3 million bonus for actually being good at his job. The additional bonus was a reward for steering the company to record shipments and profits despite a weakening PC market. And what did Mr. Yuanqing do with that money? He gave it back to his employees. That second bonus was broken down into 10,000 discrete chunks and dispersed to line workers, assistants and other lower-level employees. I think that officially makes Yang Yuanqing our new favorite CEO in tech.

Edit: The skeptic in me wanted to check this guy out some more to see if this was some kind of publicity stunt or if he was the type of guy that would do this sincerely. Found a profile of him done by Bloomberg back in '06. http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-12-10/chinas-first-global-capitalist  Seems to be a pretty down to earth guy. Son of two surgeons who were dirt poor during the cultural revolution and suffered through re-education. 

One anecdote in particular says a lot about the guy imo: ""Yang's only toy was a bag of marbles; if he wanted to play ball, he'd scrunch up a cast-off cigarette package. His mother, Wang Biqin, gave him a tiny allowance each month, but he rarely spent it because he knew that she might have to take it back to buy food.""",,False,,t5_2qh2v,1342814592.0,,kr,True,t3_wvmbu,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/wvmbu/lenovo_ceo_spreads_the_wealth_distributes_his_3/,

I am fluent in Japanese and I started picking up Mandarin last semester. I have also been active in couchsurfing.org for a few years and have hosted nearly 100 people from around the world. Last semester I shared a room with a Chinese girl (let's call her X) in my dorm and we became close friends... or so I thought.

X and I wanted to continue living together so we found an apartment with her friend and their current roommate. I am the only one with US citizenship, so I needed to sign the lease and whatnot. I thought this would be a great opportunity to learn about Chinese culture, immerse myself in Mandarin, and teach English, which is what I want to do after I graduate.

I had too high of hopes.

X no longer speaks with me. She doesn't even want me to help her with her English homework. Her English abilities have atrophied, and one of my roommates is an absolute beginner. I offended the beginner quite deeply by cleaning the kitchen and touching her things and then moving them to a place she couldn't reach. She has a very bad temper and is constantly upset with the one roommate who speaks to me when they invite me to do things with them. This has pushed me out of their group.

My roommates spend hours having a good time in one room eating snacks and watching programs. They have never invited me to join them. They don't seem to like it when I bring snacks to them and try to talk to them. They don't like entering my room. I just sit alone, wondering what the hell has happened.

I've recently learned they don't want to know English and that they paid people to write their college applications. I also learned this weekend that two of them left for Las Vegas without even telling me let alone saying goodbye. They don't say hello to me. They don't even answer me when I tell them I'm leaving and I'll see them later.

**tl;dr: I'm being ostracized by the Chinese people I'm living with. I'm desperate to figure out how to interact with them and why they dislike me so much.**

EDIT: Why yes, I am a girl.

UPDATE: Thanks to all of your help, I understand my situation much more clearly. These girls looked up to me when they needed my help. Now that I'm useless to them, they are quick to anger at my presence. This is not the kind of behavior I should allow. The beginner at English is manipulating my other roommates so that they don't talk to me. She and I are not going to be friends no matter what I do for her. She is not going to listen to my advice on why materialism and dependence are worth letting go of. I'm going to ignore her from now on.

UPDATE: Finally, my roommates and I were all put into one room together. The princess who I offended so deeply, I'll start calling her Y, made lots of excuses as to why she couldn't talk to me. But... We finally had a discussion and I'm here to let you know what's become of us.

First I talked to the landlady since she stopped by while I was waiting for X and Y to come home. I asked her about the lease and to my surprise, yes, we are all on it. This was a grave misunderstanding that I began to realize after posting this. I knew we all signed, but I was under the impression that they had no way of being on the lease here... However, they can leave after they find a replacement. They don't want to do that though.

When everyone got together, Y had a hissy fit. She started throwing things and yelling. The roommate who likes me, J, had to restrain her. She really doesn't want anything to do with me. Y and X (my roommate from last semester whom I was really good friends with) were wearing matching $300 Juicy Couture outfits. To which I commented on: wow, Y has really turned you into a different person. Maybe you should give me back that friendship bracelet and the gift I made for you when we were living together. She promptly brought both of these things back as if she were bringing me a pencil to write a grocery list. This hit me really hard. She has changed. Or maybe she's just more of who she wanted to be before. Now she's just somebody that I used to know. *breaks into song to lighten the mood*

Y explained to me that she never wanted to live with me. She doesn't like Americans. She doesn't want to be around me because I don't have a 100% Chinese cultural identity. Yeah, sorry for having lived around the world and found it's better to accept everyone than be a pig-headed nationalist. 

J really feels for me here. X has abandoned me, Y is a real bitch who I found out brags about the fact that she gets everything she wants, and I'm kind of off to the side here. I really hope J doesn't end up disliking me for some superficial reason, leaving me completely isolated in this house.

Neither Y nor X want to move. They will stay here. We will share the same common space. We will live separate lives. This will continue until July (or May if they move back to China for the summer). May I gain and keep wu wei during these months...

i am married but i do not always wear my wedding ring. i rarely get hit on here in china so wearing a ring is not big deal. a good day for me is having the siji tell me i'm ""hen piaoliang!"" so just hanging out eating and talking with our new friends. i excuse myself to go piss on some stairs. as i am walking back to our table one of the guys we were talking with chases me down. thinking nothing of it he grabs my arm and we start walking together back to the table. there is a hotel that is right in front of the bbq joint. you can walk around the hotel or you can walk through the hotel lobby to get back to the bbq joint. so, again thinking nothing of it, we walk together through the lobby to get back to the table. instead he starts pulling me towards the elevator. i give him a ""are you fucking crazy"" look and he is still pulling me to the elevator. i asked what he was doing. he just looked at me and smiled and continued to pull me towards the elevator. the guy was trying to take me upstairs to sleep with him. i was incredibly creeped out, left him and went back to the table to tell my husband what had happened. the dude we were ""gambeiing"" with and being buddies with just tried to drag me upstairs to have his way with me. we were done. no good bye and friendly banter. wtf? 

like i said not my first time. at the intercontinental hotel i was having an after work drink. again, some friendly chinese guys ask me to join and have a few beers on them. before you know it ""Mr. liu wants you to join him upstairs..."". i quickly said my good byes and headed out. the guy walks me out and then grabs my boobs. GRABS MY DAMN TITS!!!

so ladies, has this ever happened to you? i do not ever feel unsafe here in china but chinese men proposition me with sex whenever i go out. even when i with my husband. i am not wearing anything sexy or giving them any idea that i hook. i am friendly and buy beers or ciggies and have a nice time with the people around. i in no way shape or form give these guess the impression that i want to have sex with them. i would like to think that i am not the only one this happens to.....

**EDIT: a couple of you guys are victim blaming. saying that because i drink beers i deserve what i get. i do not smoke but we often carry cigarettes with us because my husband smokes. wtf is wrong with some of ya's?

I've been giving it some thoughts recently, what are some of the customs you can just not accept and will not do no matter it hurts your in-laws or friends?


I'm not talking about kids shitting in the bus or groups of youngsters who shout ""Hello"" from 2 kilometers, but about things your chinese friends or family expect you to do.


For me it would be:

* Fighting like crazy for the bill. If you invite me I accept it, if I invite you I will go pay for it before you get the chance to argue. It just annoys me and it's useless...

* Carrying my girlfriend's (now wife) bag. No way...

* Calling everybody aunt/uncle/sister/brother. I do it with my in-laws because I'm not that rude. Otherwise it just annoys me.

* Parents in-law who treat you like you are two years old. They are the reason for my wife being a lazy/not capable person, it annoys me and I let them know (in a polite way).

Why is swinging so taboo?  It seems well known and practically accepted that men have their mistresses and women have their misters outside of marriage.  So why the shame on playing together in China? 

Question 2:

Where do like minded people meet in China?  We are in Shenzhen and all we have to rely on are foreign websites which are very limited in their user numbers. The couples we have met tell stories of (swinger) bars in other countries with hundreds of people. Is there a Chinese system in place that we haven't discovered yet?

I've lived in India for a total of nine months. It's significantly more crowded than China, many people are from rural areas, and yet they are *great* at walking through crowded urban environments. It's very rare that someone bumps into you walking in India, whereas in China it happens all the time.

It's particularly bad when people are carrying something (especially luggage), and especially near escalators where people just abruptly stop at the top and the bottom as if they were genuinely unaware of the existence of other human beings.

We always play pool there and the four girls in our group were playing pool and had a few balls left when an obviously drunk chinese man around our age in the early twenties comes up and starts racking the balls. The girls in our group got really angry and they were yelling at each other when the man ran across the table and punched our friend in her face. We freaked out and pushed them out of the way and got out of there because our chinese friend told us they were calling more friends to come, I guess defend his honor. 

Fast forward to the next day and just the guys in our group go out for a beer or two and we head back home around midnight. Well turns out nine chinese men were waiting in the park across the street, one had a bat and they walked past us and we didnt notice them as we were getting a taxi, and went in the bar. I turned around five seconds later and three of them were jumping on my friend and two on me. My other friend punched one and i pushed one and they ran off after hitting my british friend the most because he pushed the man the night before and I helped break up the fight so they came after us mainly. None of us were hurt just a few bruises and scratchs but nothing big. It was just a crazy experience.

Help plz! ,AnonymousForeigner,47,10,141,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/xr0yx/my_husband_has_been_living_in_china_over_a_year/,"My husband and I are married over a year now. I am from China, he is from the States. Because of my visa issue, I had to come back to China and spend two physical years after I have worked in the States. My husband came back to Beijing with me in 2011 and that was when his nightmare began. One culture shock after another and he became depressed. After finding a decent job early this April, he felt better. He has been fighting with the inconsideration in China and many other things, such as the lack of privacy in daily life, rich people can do whatever they want in China and of course also the traffic. 

Going to the gym is his only way out. Not to mention he has to deal with the weight dropping, loud singing and half naked dudes in the gym. Yesterday a personal trainer in the gym suddenly stood behind his back and tried to spot him when he was doing his working set squat without saying anything. It was extremely dangerous and the whole thing just lit him on fire. 

He is so tired of Chinese start doing something without asking and many other things. He feels he has no way out as long as he is in China. I think he needs to go back to the States for a while to decompress, but he cannot do it right now because of work. So he is very depressed from being in China, to the point where he does not want to talk or do anything. 

He and I went through a lot in the past year. China is not a easy place to live and I know he sacrificed a lot moving to China with me. I told him how he feels is normal and he is not alone. He loves reddit and I think this might be a nice way out for him. I am open to any suggestions or comments. I know he is not the only one who feels this way, please share your story or advise. I appreciate it!!!!!

I eat Chinese food for probably 70% of my meals.

I realize generalizations are difficult (and dangerous, on occasion), but there are times I feel like many of my Chinese friends have absolutely zero comprehension of what makes up a healthy, nutritious diet. This comes in contrast to my Western friends (some who are unhealthy/fat), but, if pressed, could at least come up with a reasonable list to delineate what foods are healthy and what foods are not.

Despite claims about the heat-alleviating benefits of fruit, most of my friends don't drink fruit juice or eat any fruit or vegetables whatsoever (outside of the occasional oil-doused dish at dinnertime). High-starch carbohydrates (noodles, breads, pastries) make up most of my friends diets, along with preservative-laced milk teas, instant food, and all manner of other preserved junk. There are also massive quantities of salt (and MSG, of course) in virtually all of the dishes. 

Of course, one might raise the counterpoint - ""but they're so thin!"" To which I would respond - yes, many are, but obesity is rising in many areas, and I feel like the level of general health I see is in many cases is extremely low - people are thin, certainly, but even taking stairs or sprinting across a street will completely exhaust many of my friends (cigarettes might be a factor in that as well).

Anyway, the reason I bring this up is because I have some questions. One of them is related to the topic of 拉肚子 - ""pulling the stomach,"" or getting the runs, as it were. I'm convinced that the reason this is such a common topic of discussion is simply because of the stuff people put into their bodies - of course your digestive tract will go into revolt! If there's someone with a medical/digestive scientific background I would appreciate some insight on this (obviously unsanitary food practices and food safety scandals/ fake food play a role as well).

The other odd thing about my impressions regarding food is that - it's almost a cliché to say - this is a culture completely obsessed with food in many ways. The preparation of  food, the metaphors and culture of dining and banquets - it's a religion in some ways.

So - can someone help me unravel the paradoxes of this uniquely Chinese perspective on nutrition? I realize it's a big question, but I would appreciate some clarity - or at least other perspectives.",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,t3_xcc4q,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/xcc4q/the_chinese_diet/,

1374670436.0,39,self.China,1iyba0,"Some true stories. Update of""I am a Chinese who works in an African country...What do you want to know about me or my life here or the lives of Chinese who work here?""",valentine_rocky,48,9,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1iyba0/some_true_stories_update_ofi_am_a_chinese_who/,"The AMA:http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1invi9/i_am_a_chinese_who_works_in_an_african/

**Story1**, A sad story: I saw two girls around 7 or 8 years old wearing team shirts of Barcelona begging money from every car stooping by the red light on Boulevard du 13 Janvier, a main street perpendicular to the coast line where our garage was located before moving to the new location here one year ago. I noticed them from a lot more children beggars here because they were not africans-at least not pure africans. They were like mixed blood of black and white or maybe just arabs, I don't know. It's hard for me to tell the difference from Arabs and Whites. To my personal view I thought them very pretty and cute though always dirty on their faces.--Ok, DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT FACE, I'M NOT A PEDOROSIS Freak, my appreciation of their beauty had nothing related with sexual desire. I was curious about them and asked our local driver. He said maybe they were abandoned bastard daughters of some white man(prick). Some Chinese told me they are refugees of Afghanistan or Libya. I gave them some money several times.

Then one day I found them disappeared. I haven't seen them anymore. I mentioned them one time when chatting other Chinese online and one told me in a tone of joking: ""Maybe they were sold to some rich black or white. Their virginity is much more expensive than black girls."" I was disgusted by his speech and shocked of his speculating. And that reminded me I was in an poor african country. I mean even though Lome is somehow an big international city and this kind of tragedy even happened in my own country so why would I be shocked? What am I expecting? A happy fairy tale ending? 

And I felt ashamed of myself when I realized I cared about them only because they are pretty little girls and  not locals like many other children beggars on the streets. Was there ONE TIME I care about other black children beggars? Maybe one or two times when I noticed them rather than losing into my own thoughts while driving by. Even my Messiah complex was so picky. And that's when I truly and fully understand the famous quote from our 《道德经》: A real saint show no mercy or sympathy to anyone or anything. The sky and the earth show no preference to anyone or anything.""(天地不仁，以万物为刍狗；圣人不仁以万物为刍狗。）


**Story2**: ""Chinese Dream"". Our driver whose name is Samuel once asked me questions like:""Is it true that you Chinese don't need to pay money for hospital?""or""Is it true that your government will give you free houses?""or""Is it true that education in China is for free?"" I answered ""no, no and partly yes."" One of his brother(I don't know if he's his real brother because they called every male brother) lives and works in Guangzhou China and from his description China was like a paradise where everything is super cheap and have plenty of opportunities to make a fortune. Samuel asked me several times if I or our company could help him get a Chinese visa. I said no and he seemed very disappointed. 

I fully understand their fault images and expectation of China. We had similar ones about USA back to 10~20 years ago. Watch the famous TV series ""Beijinger In New York"". I never thought there would be one day when China would be destinations and homes for foreign immigrants. I was growing up with being told that everything was better in 外国. This 外国 can be USA, Russia, UK, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, or Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Egypt, Congo... And when I was grown up and know better about foreign countries I found that they are not so good. This kind of feelings grows into overconfidence and extremely nationalism for some people. Some people refuse to believe that and insist their inferior complex about their own country. And some people (young generations) like me just go between them. Inferior? No more. Confident? Yes, but not extremely and blindly. 

I read news about the black communities AKA ""Chocolate City"" in Guangzhou and the riot after a Nigerian illegal immigrant's death when he was chasing by local police. If lives in China were really that good like Samuel's brother's description then this riot would not happened. 

Samuel's Chinese dream would continue for a long time I guess. Maybe someday he would get to chance to go to China by legal or illegal ways. What are the Africans lives like in China? What are they thinking about? Are they planning to settle down permanently?  I don't know. No one knows and few care. 

**Story3** :Politics. I mentioned in my AMA that most Chinese including me are not interested in local politics. But more or less we have to be affected by it. For example, tomorrow will be the day of election of their parliament so we have a day off. This is the good influence we expect. And there is bad one.

In 2010~2011, the president Faure，son of former president, won the election again, the opposition party organized a series of demonstrations before and after the election. This is democracy.Although I don't really believe in multiple-party democracy, I have nothing against Togolaise people to realize it until I was struck in the streets several times when it's occupied by the demonstrating people. Hmmmmm....Maybe I was too selfish, after all they were fighting for their own rights( But I doubted most rights-fighters were just paid by the opposition party). 

Then in April 2011 the peaceful demonstration turned into something violent. The angry youth(like those in China) began to use violence to ""express"" their demand. They began to smash the foreigner shops( most are Chinese owned) and facilities. Unfortunately our new location was on the main road to Lome Airport on which there is a Korean Wig factory which employed hundreds of local workers and became the main target of those unemployed angry young men. On that day we didn't close our garage because we didn't expect it goes so far. When we heard the crowd it was too late to flee. So we close our doors and hide inside. I missed wholes situation because I was too scared to go outside to see what's happening. Luckily we weren't their target and were rarely influenced. But it's not so lucky for the Wig factory. When we finally got our chance to leave I saw broken doors and blooding people. Days after, one of our employees told me that more than one people were killed. Sorry for them.

And then the opposition party used some other ways to express their ""legal"" demand like organizing a ""WOMEN EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR CONSTITUTION AND OPPOSITION PARTY BY REFUSING HAVING SEX WITH THEIR HUSBANDS"" movement....You can google it....

My experience of their politics is scary but far from dangerous. However what my boss told me about his horrible adventure in 2005 was a completely different story. 

In 2005, the former and beloved president（sorry I don't know his name) died for disease and the striving for the power of presidency caused brutal and violent riots especially when foreign scoundrels were involved. Google it if you are interested. 

My boss and his wife and cousin were there and were not planning to escape for the hope of better situation. However their scariest nightmare came one night. Mobs from Ghana came through the borderline to ""join the party of riots"". On that night, their mansion was on siege by a crowd of mobs and they were shouting and throwing rocks into the yard. Some mobs tried to climb the wall but were pushed back by my boss(who is very strong) and his cousin with a steel rob and a machete. My boss told me he was ready for killing to protect her wife in the mansion. I can't imagine what would happen to them if they failed. Several foreigners were killed in that riots and fortunately my boss and his family were not among them.

**STORY 4** The spoon. I had to go to our garage early this morning and when my errand's done I decided to walk home because the air in the morning after whole night's rain is (this story happened only 30 minutes ago) so fresh and cool and our mansion is only ten minutes walk from home. The street was almost empty. Most men were gone to polling station and those who stayed were mostly women and children. 

I felt hungry when I passed by a food stand. These food stands, offering simply cooked rice, spaghatti, macaroni, eggs, beans and sauce can be found in every corner of every street in Lome. Most people buy food in the day instead of cooking at home-I've been to a poor local's home, and found their homes are somehow like 四合院 in Beijing, a big yard live four of five families, share the same public space. They don't have a kitchen but cook their food outdoor in the yard with rock-made oven and big iron pot. 

I bought some food including the rice. Though had food in these food stands for thousand times I never tried their rice. I came from the ""Home of Rice"" in China and am very picky with rices. But this time I decided to try it.After giving me the food I commend the salesgirl turned to other guests who were staring at the white(yes we Chinese are also white in their eyes) man buying their food. She forgot something- the spoon. I tried to find one on the desk but didn't find it. It wasn't a negligence for her because most Africans eat their food with their fingers. So I asked her to give me one spoon and she said:y'a pas. C'est finis. (no spoons, they are finished.). 

I was wondering if I should try my fingers or just give the food to someone and leave, a elder woman sitting aside with her own plate of food called me and handed me her spoon. I didn't want to be rude so I took it. She said she hadn't use it yet. I noticed her food in the plate still remained untouched so she told the truth. I thanked her but was still hesitating about whether use it. She was looking at me as if she's waiting for my answer. 

Then I remembered my knowledge of biology. Very few pathogenic bacteria could survive in the air after leaving human body. Using this spoon she haven't used would not get me infected with communicable disease. So I thanked her again and finished my food with it.

To my surprise, the rice was not that bad(though it's still under my standard). ",,False,,t5_2qh2v,1374743383.0,,cn,True,t3_1iyba0,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1iyba0/some_true_stories_update_ofi_am_a_chinese_who/,

I've noticed here on /r/China that people who aren't English teachers have a tendency to look down on those who are.  This is whatever, but I see a lot of commenting about how if someone's an English teacher trying to get their foot in the door elsewhere, the people already in other business have no respect for them.  

I've personally backed myself into a corner rather unwittingly: I assumed good Chinese would be worth something, and after coming here have realized that it's not, unless paired with another skill.  I haven't really got that, aside from some minimal HR experience.  My degree is, of course, irrelevant.  

My questions are as follows: has anyone here broken the English teacher cycle? Does anyone have any advice as to how to escape it?  

What I'm not interested in: You telling me what I should have done instead.  That's already over.  Also not interested in the general English teacher slander.

I'm an american born chinese gal in her twentysomethings, and was happily living in NYC. I was bartending, planning to finish my last two years of college (had to take a break due to extenuating circumstances), with a great circle of friends and a really awesome dog. Things were going gravy, and I started sharing an apt with a friend. I was finally out on my own, and out of my parents house! Things started going downhill very quickly from there. 

Mind you, I have very old school, traditional, Chinese parents. They had already disapproved of me working at a bar, but me leaving the house seemed to be too much for them (I believe they want me to be married with a solid career before I go off living on my own). I had also made it clear to them I had no intention of moving with them to China (which they plan to do within the next few years), and that I'm fully capable of being on my own in the country I was born and raised in. They didn't expressly fight me on this, which in hindsight, should have alarmed me. For years, they've wanted me to at least visit China - but I never had the time due to the constraints of school/work. This year though, my father bought himself and I a ticket to Hong Kong without even first telling me about it. They said they just wanted me to open up my worldview, and see things from a different perspective- And, that it would only be for 3 weeks AT MOST. I was reluctant, but then I decided it would be nice to spend some time with my father, since we haven't had any family vacations in over a decade. 

As you may have guessed by now, my ticket was one way. They never intended me to leave. My father had bought a condo in Zhuhai, Guangzhou, where we've been staying. They also enrolled me in a TEFL course, and are adamant that I'll have a perfect future and career as an english teacher in China. The problem is, it's THEIR perfect little future for me, and they set it up without caring or asking what I WANT. They have straight up said they don't want me to go back to the States, and that if I want to, I'll have to find my own way back. 

What can I do but to walk this road now that they've so haphazardly thrown together? I have no savings, so I'll have to find some kind of work if I ever want to have a chance to get back to the home where my heart is. Though, what kind of chance in hell do I have to find work in a place where I can't read/speak the local language?! I can speak cantonese, but not a lick of mandarin. I feel so strange and alien, walking around not even knowing what the shop signs say, or read a menu, or tell the difference between the shampoo and conditioner in a store. I feel like an awkward, mentally challenged local, since I look just like them, but can't answer them when they spew out mandarin in super speed to me. 

Also, I have an L-visa, and my Dad seems to think I can just pop in to Hong Kong and back to renew it every 90 days. I know schools offer Z-visas to their English teachers but that's making the giant assumption that I'll even find someone that would hire an ABC english teacher. The thought did cross my mind to get myself deported back somehow, but that sounds just *kinda* risky and reckless. Unless one of you has a brilliant idea that could prove otherwise...

Any other foreign born chinese in China that can share their experiences (in China and/or as an English Teacher)? Or anyone that can give me some advice, words of wisdom, encouragement? My father will be returning to the states next week, and I'll be alone in this strange foreign world with no friends, job, or any idea what I'm doing.

I am now in grad school and there are a lot of international Chinese students. I am fluent in both Mandarin and Cantonese so I live with 3 such students and a lot of my friends are also international Chinese students. To them, I am American apparently.

What I don't understand is why they complain about everything in the US and how everything in China is better. I just don't get that sentiment. I mean, there are a lot of things I prefer in the US and a lot I rather have it done the Chinese way and vice versa. I don't go around trying to bash down China whenever I get a chance so this topic almost never comes up from me unless someone talks about it. I am not even sure if I count as American or Chinese so I remain neutral in most issues unless it's something I dislike because I dislike it.

But most my friends and roommates just go on non-stop about how China is superior. I understand their nationalism (but don't agree with it since it's a bit too fervent) but it's just really uncalled for. I don't understand what kind of response they want out of me, and I really don't understand why most of them are studying in the US and are trying to find ways to stay in the US when everything is apparently so much better in China.

This happens a lot when I go visit relatives back in China too. People in China go on and on about how the US is terrible, yet the same people are trying to find ways to either get there or get their kids to go there.

The hypocrisy is way too much and frankly I am really tired of it. I've lived with international students from other countries as well as Americans and I've never seen this kind of attitude. I am Chinese and I can kind of see where the nationalism is coming from and even then I am annoyed by it.

But there's one thing, that I don't think is necessarily a bad thing, is just an interesting quirk of daily life in China that I can't get an answer about. 

Chinese people are totally and utterly un-phased be repeating sounds/music/whatever.

Some anecdotes.

* Before I got out of teaching, my school played ""Lemon Tree"" by Fool's Garden, on repeat, for 70 minutes each day at lunch. 

* In the morning, the same three songs were played every day before school started

* A teacher I shared an office with played the same song on repeat once, for FOUR HOURS.

* Da Ning Life Hub, a mall near the Shanghai Railway Station, used to play only one song on their speakers, on repeat, all day. I saw it on a report on International Channel Shanghai. The manager didn't see a problem with it.

* I can't count how many cafes and shops I've been to that only have two or three songs on loop. 

* But then there's also the people with bullhorns riding their scooters around town selling stuff with the same shouting message on a 2-3 second loop, for HOURS. 

* At the bank, the TV had a 30 second commercial playing on repeat. 

* Even a taxi ride last night, the GPS system for the driver binged and bonged and whistled every few seconds.


What is it that allows people to tune out what otherwise is maddening repetition?

We all wish the best of luck to the author of [a certain post on this thread related to this subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/17petc/chinese_bf_update_day_42/), but it sounds like the setup to a Chinglish snuff film.  Maybe it is true love.  For everyone else, though, there needs to be some sort of way to compensate for this treatment.

First, the moral argument.  If you live in a country, you should learn the language, and adapt the culture.  Similarly, the host country should welcome outsiders dedicated to assimilating.  This is not the case in China.

Second, assumptions.

* Let's say an English tutor costs ¥100 per hour.
* Assume a married couple will probably spend five hours a day talking to each other (starting at 17:00 after work and then end at 22:00 when they fall asleep).
* There are an average of 30.4 days in a month, so tutoring time comes out to costing ¥15,200 a month.
* Renminbi deposits currently yield 3.25% per year.

Everyone knows the medium of exchange in China for marriages is a house.  The key here is to discount the present value of the total estimated free tutoring time over the span of the marriage, to calculate the minimum acceptable value of the house.

Assume the marriage lasts fifty years (from age 25 until you die at 75).  That house needs to be equal or greater than ¥4.5 million, to make it worth your time.

A divorce makes it trickier.  If you split the value of the house in half at the time of divorce, the original purchase price needs to be double the present value of your tutoring at the time of the divorce.  For example, a house along the Third Ring Road would cost about ¥2 million, or ¥1 million after the divorce.  The present value of your tutoring at six years is ¥993,089, so six years is the cut-off point for your marriage.  Otherwise you are losing money.

Here is the Excel equation if anyone would like to do their own calculations:

    =PV(3.25%/12,[YEARS]*12,[MONTHLY TUTORING FEE])

**EXTRA CONSIDERATION:**  Most countries offer permanent residency to foreign spouses of nationals.  China does not reciprocate.  In the case of Americans, a Chinese spouse could get a green card.  The other option is the Cash for Greencards Program (otherwise known as the ""Immigrant Investor Program""), which costs about $500,000.  If the purpose of the marriage is improving English *and* emigrating from China, an extra sum should be added, either as a larger house or in cash.",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,t3_17qv4m,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/17qv4m/so_youre_going_to_marry_a_language_rapist/,

He was amongst the hundreds (or thousands) arrested but never formally charged (family not informed, embassy also not informed).
The case has dragged on until now and despite having made numerous trips to China, we were unable to meet him. 
Shortly after he was arrested he was transfered to a bigger holding station of Fujian but a month ago the charges were dropped and he was transfered back to NingDe with other charges. The lawyer told us that the best we could wish for is for his case to go on trial, but that the officials holding him would not sign his case off to court. And if he isnt sent to court after the 30th of July, his case will be sent back again to be re-investigated and the whole process repeats itself. 

What should/could we do? it is all so frustrating and we are all so helpless after nearly a year of my father being held in custody which seems endless and of course, against human rights. 

I must also add that my father was of course not part of the crime ring but he was arrested because of abnormal transactions in his accounts which the authorities mistaken as money laundering.
He is currently being charged for illegal operations.

A new food policy from the CEO himself (a white man).  Previously, we could eat lunch at our desks.  Now, we will be banned from ordering/bringing *Chinese* food to our desks to eat it.  Why, you ask?  ""It smells"".  But surely we can eat it in the break room, right?  **Wrong again.**  There will be no break room.  My boss actually told me --- and this was backed up by another *laowai* employee who sold his soul to this company ages ago --- that we should get used to the idea of eating our lunch in the hallway, if we want to order in Chinese food.  He justified this by reminding us that employees in another city's office already do this.  As if that makes it okay.

Furthermore, Western food *will* be permitted for desk consumption.  Sandwiches and burgers were the provided examples.  Because burgers don't smell, obviously.  Does anyone else find this highly, highly offensive?  If I were a Chinese employee and my white CEO told me that my country's food is so stinky, it's unfit for office consumption, while a steaming hunk of beef is totally fine, I'd explode.  I'm close to exploding as is.

It gets worse.  Our options for food now are either getting (expensive) Western food, or going out to some of the (few) Chinese restaurants in the area.  The only problem is that my company comprises three entire floors' worth of people.  Not to mention the glut of other office workers (there's a whole office park across the street) who also have lunch from 12 to 1 and will also be rushing to these restaurants.  I'm familiar with the area, as I used to work there at my previous company, and so I'm quite well aware of the lack of cheap food options it presents.

Let's hear your horror stories.  Please make me feel better.

**TLDR**; My company's new food policy bans Chinese food in the office, while permitting Western food.  They offer no place in the building to consume an affordable Chinese lunch other than in the hallway.

(you have to create a account to read the article, I copied and pasted the text below.)




Here's how it would happen. Children playing along an urban river bank would spot hundreds of grotesque, bloated pig carcasses bobbing downstream. Hundreds of miles away, angry citizens would protest the rising stench from piles of dead ducks and swans, their rotting bodies collecting by the thousands along river banks. And three unrelated individuals would stagger into three different hospitals, gasping for air. Two would quickly die of severe pneumonia and the third would lay in critical condition in an intensive care unit for many days. Government officials would announce that a previously unknown virus had sickened three people, at least, and killed two of them. And while the world was left to wonder how the pigs, ducks, swans, and people might be connected, the World Health Organization would release deliberately terse statements, offering little insight.

It reads like a movie plot -- I should know, as I was a consultant for Steven Soderbergh's Contagion. But the facts delineated are all true, and have transpired over the last six weeks in China. The events could, indeed, be unrelated, and the new virus, a form of influenza denoted as H7N9, may have already run its course, infecting just three people and killing two.

Or this could be how pandemics begin.

On March 10, residents of China's powerhouse metropolis, Shanghai, noticed some dead pigs floating among garbage flotsam in the city's Huangpu River. The vile carcasses appeared in Shanghai's most important tributary of the mighty Yangtze, a 71-mile river that is edged by the Bund, the city's main tourist area, and serves as the primary source of drinking water and ferry travel for the 23 million residents of the metropolis and its millions of visitors. The vision of a few dead pigs on the surface of the Huangpu was every bit as jarring for local Chinese as porcine carcasses would be for French strolling the Seine, Londoners along the Thames, or New Yorkers looking from the Brooklyn Bridge down on the East River.

And the nightmarish sight soon worsened, with more than 900 animal bodies found by sunset on that Sunday evening. The first few pig carcass numbers soon swelled into the thousands, turning Shanghai spring into a horror show that by March 20 would total more than 15,000 dead animals. The river zigzags its way from Zhejiang province, just to the south of Shanghai, a farming region inhabited by some 54 million people, and a major pork-raising district of China. Due to scandals over recent years in the pork industry, including substitution of rendered pig intestines for a toxic chemical, sold as heparin blood thinner that proved lethal to American cardiac patients, Chinese authorities had put identity tags on pigs' ears. The pig carcasses were swiftly traced back to key farms in Zhejiang, and terrified farmers admitted that they had dumped the dead animals into the Huangpu.

Few Chinese asked, ""What killed the pigs?,"" because river pollution is so heinous across China that today people simply assume manufacturing chemicals or pesticides fill the nation's waterways, and are responsible for all such mysterious animals demises. The Yangtze, which feeds Shanghai's Huangpu, has copper pollution levels that are 100 times higher than U.S. safety standards, and leather tanning facilities along the river have notoriously been responsible for toxic waste, including chromium. And across China -- especially in Beijing -- air pollution was so bad in January and February that pollution particulate levels routinely peaked at higher than 10 times the U.S. safety standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. When I was in Beijing in late January, the air pollution was so thick that it visually looked like fog, obscuring all sunlight and even skyscrapers located less than three city blocks away. So, hideous as the pig carcasses might be, Shanghai residents tended to shrug them off as yet another example of the trade-offs China is making, pitting prosperity against pollution.

But 12 days after the first Shanghai porcine death flow was spotted, pig carcasses washed up along the shores of Changsha's primary river, the Xiang -- also a Yangtze tributary, this one located hundreds of miles west of Shanghai. Known as ""the Sky City"" for its 2,749-foot-tall central tower, Changsha is home to more than 7 million people and capital of Hunan province. Along with some 50 dead pigs, authorities collected a few thousand dead ducks from the Xiang on March 22 and 23.

Two days later, another mass duck and swan die-off was spotted, this time along the Sichuan River hundreds of miles to the north, near Lake Qinghai. The lake is the most important transit and nesting site for migratory aquatic birds that travel the vast Asia flyway, stretching from central Siberia to southern Indonesia. In 2005, a mass die-off of aquatic birds in and around Lake Qinghai resulted from a mutational change in the long-circulating bird flu virus, H5N1 -- a genetic shift that gave that virus a far larger species range, allowing H5N1 to spread for the first time across Russia, Ukraine and into Europe, the Middle East and North Africa -- it has remained in circulation across the vast expanse of Earth for the last seven years.

On March 25, Chinese authorities seized manufactured pork buns that were found to be made from Zhejiang pigs that had died of the mysterious ailment. The possibly contaminated pork was in the Chinese food supply. By the end of March, at least 20,000 pig carcasses and tens of thousands of ducks and swans had washed upon riverbanks that stretch from the Lake Qinghai area all the way to the East China Sea -- a distance roughly equivalent to the span between Miami and Boston. Nobody knows how many more thousands of birds and pigs have died, but gone uncounted as farmers buried or burned the carcasses to avoid reprimands from authorities.

While environmental clean-up and agricultural authorities scrambled to remove the unsightly corpses and provide the anxious public with less-than-believable explanations for their demise, a seemingly separate human drama was unfolding. On Feb. 19, a man identified by Xinhua, China's state news agency, only as Li, an 87-year old retiree, was hospitalized in Shanghai with severe respiratory distress and pneumonia. On March 4, Li went into severe cardio-respiratory failure and succumbed.

On Feb. 27, a man identified only as Wu, a 27-year-old butcher or meat processor, fell ill with respiratory distress, was hospitalized, and died on March 10. The day Wu succumbed a third individual, a 35-year-old woman identified as Han, was hospitalized in the city of Nanjing, though she came from distant Chuzhou City, in Anhui province, about 300 miles northwest of Shanghai. Han is reportedly in critical condition, in intensive care. To date, no connection between the three individuals has been found.

The elderly Li may have been part of a family cluster of illness, as his 55-year old son died of pneumonia in March, and another 67-year-old son suffered respiratory distress, but has survived.

On March 31 -- Easter in the United States -- China's newly created National Health and Family Planning Commission (which includes the former Ministry of Health) announced that 87-year-old Li, Wu, and Han all were infected with a form of influenza denoted as H7N9 -- a type of flu never previously known to infect human beings. The commission insisted that Li's two sons (one dead, the other a survivor) were not infected with the flu virus -- their ailments were reportedly coincidental, though they occurred at the same time as the elder Li's demise.

So much for the backstory: What is going on?

According to Chinese authorities, some of the dead pigs tested antibody-positive for circoviruses, or PCV-2, and samples of the virus were isolated from Huangpu River. The implication was that the Shanghai pigs died of PCV-2, a type of virus that is harmless to human beings, as well as birds. Photographs of the carcasses reveal that the animals were large adult hogs, but PCV-2 does not kill adult pigs -- it is lethal to fetuses and newborn piglets.

The Chinese health authorities have to date offered no cause of death for the ducks and swans, failed to describe any unusual genetic features that might have turned the PCV-2 into an adult pig-killer virus, and insisted there is no connection between the pigs, people, and birds. Though the surviving woman, Han, had some contact with live chickens, according to Xinhua, neither Li nor Wu had any known contact with birds. Wu has been identified variously as a butcher, meat processor, and employee of a meat plant -- all of which might imply he had contact with pigs.

Influenzas are named according to the specific nature of two proteins found on the virus -- the H stands for hemaggluntinin and the N for neuraminidase. These proteins play various roles in the flu-infection process, including latching onto receptors on the outside of the cells of animals to transmit the virus into their bodies. Those receptors can vary widely from one species to another, which is why most types of influenza viruses spreading now around the world are harmless to human beings. As far as any scientists know, the H7N9 forms of flu have never previously managed to infect human beings, or any mammals -- it is a class of the virus found exclusively in birds. It is therefore extremely worrying to find two people killed and one barely surviving due to H7N9 infection.

One very plausible explanation for this chain of Chinese events is that the H7N9 virus has undergone a mutation -- perhaps among spring migrating birds around Lake Qinghai. The mutation rendered the virus lethal for domestic ducks and swans. Because many Chinese farmers raise both pigs and ducks, the animals can share water supplies and be in fighting proximity over food -- the spread of flu from ducks to pigs, transforming avian flu into swine flu, has occurred many times. Once influenza adapts to pig cells, it is often possible for the virus to take human-transmissible form. That's precisely what happened in 2009 with the H1N1 swine flu, which spread around the world in a massive, but thankfully not terribly virulent, pandemic.

If the pigs, people, and birds have died in China from H7N9, it is imperative and urgent that the biological connection be made, and extensive research be done to determine how widespread human infection may be. Shanghai health authorities have tested dozens of people known to have been in contact with Wu and Li, none of whom have come up positive for H7N9 infection. Assuming the tests are accurate, the mystery of Li and Wu's infections only deepens. Moreover, if they are a ""two of three,"" meaning two dead, of three known cases, the H7N9 virus is very virulent.

""At this point, these three are isolated cases with no evidence of human-to-human transmission"", the WHO representative in China, Dr. Michael O'Leary, told reporters on Monday. But, O'Leary added, the possibility of a family cluster of illness could not be ruled out, and, ""We don't know yet the causes of illness in the two sons, but naturally, if three people in one family acquire severe pneumonia in a short period of time, it raises a lot of concern.""

But Hong Kong authorities, smarting from years of outbreaks spread from mainland China including H5N1 (1997) and SARS (2003), have put the territory on health alert. ""We will heighten our vigilance and continue to maintain stringent port health measures in connection with this development,"" the Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong stated in a press release on Monday.

The Chinese National Influenza Center has posted the H7N9 genetic sequences of viruses from Li, Wu, and Han on the WHO flu site. A number of H7N9 sequences found in birds over the last few years are also posted: The human and bird strains do not match, though none of the birds strains were obtained from animals in 2013.

The mystery is deep, the clock is ticking, and the world wants answers.

If we were imagining how a terrible pandemic would unfold, this could certainly serve as an excellent script.

TLDR: Dead animals in river could have created new strain of influenza or not...",,False,,t5_2qh2v,1364923856.0,,,True,t3_1biyfk,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1biyfk/its_just_the_flu/,

I'm really happy about the enthusiasm that the new mods have shown for taking r/China in new directions. We still have the wiki/FAQ to sort out, as well as the sidebar, what we 'allow/disallow', 'encourage/discourage' and how the overall tone of the sub is moderated. I hope you can see and appreciate the interest they've shown in the future, and their commitment to continuing to keep this one of the best China-related boards around.

Being a mod is a wholly volunteer job and I'm really satisfied with the output of the work that's been put in on this sub. When I took over in 2009, this place had basically been abandoned, hovering around 2,000 users. I'm happy to see that we now have nearly 10,000 users, lots of voices and opinions and tons of interesting content to read daily.

As of today, I'm turning the reigns of /r/China over to riceagain, lordnikkon, TheDark1 and loller (edit: not that the reigns weren't already 4/5ths theirs!). I'm sure they'll continue to do a great job and I look forward to participating more as a user (not as a mod) and can't wait to see how this place grows.

Their English was just lousy. They couldn't hold a 10 minutes conversation in English. Some of them did not speak English at all. But they really wanted to marry to Americans. BTW, they were not poor at all. That private English center was very high end. 

There was one 30 year old woman who didn't speak English but had an American boyfriend who didn't speak Chinese. He came to China for the first time and she brought him to the school. They needed an electronic dictionary and ME to communicate. She was asking questions about salary, houses, and green card and I had to translate for them. They got married two months later. 

There was another woman who was already married to an American but couldn't get a visa because her English was so bad that she could not handle some simple questions for a visa interview. So she asked me to write down the answers and she would just memorize the answers. 

Why do Americans marry Chinese women who hardly speak English? Seems quite pathetic to me.

http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTEwNjc1NjU2.html

It's about a primary school that has an election and it is hilarious. 

So, I decided to show it to my college freshman class. They enjoyed it and we ended up discussing what democracy would actually look like if it developed in China. 

I have been teaching for awhile in China now and I was surprised at how well thought out and considered many of thier opinions were. Usually, they have little to nothing to say, but on this topic they perked up.

So, I decided that we would have election. The rules were simple. Since there are 50 people in the class, they can organize themselves into parties of thier own choosing and nominate one person for President from within thier party. They must campaign on ideas for improving China. 

Each person gets one vote and they cannot vote for thier own party. This point proved fatal later.  

So, they milled around with some positions. The strongest or most vocal or in one case the richest students taking a leadership roles. 

They essentially dividied into three parties.

The Force Party: Whose platform was to build up the military, take back Taiwan, fight Japan and eventually...They wouldn't say.

Thier motto was, ""Force! Force! Strong as a horse! Take back Taiwan!""

The second party was The Money Party. Thier platform consisted of economic reforms that would allow a greater majority of people to prosper. Those are my words. They just said, to get rich is great. 

Thier motto: No money, no talk.

The third and smallest party was The People Power Party (PPP). There  platform was to bring Democracy to China. They didn't really understand the ""lesson"".

So, we had a debate. The Force Party candidate dominated with brute strength and patriotism accusing the others of insufficient love of the mother country. 

The Money Party attempted to appeal to people's self-interest but was brutally attacked as a lackey of ""outsiders"".

The PPP had no luck. They had no clue what they were doing. 

In the end, we had a vote. 

Everyone voted for themselves. 

So, we had a revote after explicitly saying that you cannot vote for your own party. 

Everyone voted for themselves. 

Then I tried to do a Proportional Representation system where they all  got two votes. One they could vote for themselves and the second vote had to be for another party.

I got confused with all the ballots and decided that the Force Party won.

Nothing was learned today.

Posting guidelines: post in English which has never been enforced, silly irrelevant stuff about rediquette and upvote/downvote that is not unique to /r/China. If we don't have rules specific to /r/China, then don't have a rule section.

Frequent topics missing the MOST FREQUENT TOPIC OF ALL, itinerary requests. Blocked sites/VPNs have separate listings what??? Links are only to search terms? Why not just link directly to a thread?

Alternatively, let us look to our Japanese brethren I mean blood foes at /r/japan. Shiny green warning at top redirecting translation requests.

1. Travel stuff to /r/travel (is this really a good rule? We seem to welcome these posts as long as they are well thought out). Translation stuff to /r/ChineseLanguage 

2. Check the common questions listed below.

3. Search this subreddit and google.

4. Still have questions? Write your question in a clear concise manner, providing all relevant details. 

Common questions:

1. Interested in visiting China? Give us some information about yourself, including your age, with whom you're traveling, for how long, and what you like to do. It would help if you told us what you've found already in your research, and what holes are still missing for you. You may also consider /r/travel, or perusing through these classic threads:

2. Want to come to China long term? Have a question about visas, work permits, or getting a job? Tell us your education background, what you want to do in China and why in particular China, and what your qualifications are. You may also consider /r/chinavisa, /r/chinajobs, or these classic threads:

3. Want to discuss Chinese culture? Be mindful of any cultural biases you may carry, and be prepared for people to disagree with you. Watch out: some posters might troll you with completely false information.

4. Concerned about the great firewall? Want to learn about VPNs and torrenting? China blocks youtube and facebook, among other websites, and you cannot reliably circumvent that without either money or a lot of time and effort. Usually it's not worth it if you're here on vacation. Still can't live without your addiction? Read these classic threads:

This sub is often accused of being negative and I understand why that happens. We need a place to bitch and rant about life in China and we can all relate to some of the problems that happen here. Better to rant here than to our friends / colleagues / co-teachers!   
  
But I don't believe that the negativity truly reflects our experiences of China. We all have numerous stories of joy and love and sharing. Let's share them for christmas.  
 
The first year I was in China it was cold. Damn cold. Those who have been around a while will know that of course I refer to the winter of 07/08, the coldest year in China for 50 years. Even in my mild town the snow was heavy and I was staying in an ancient apartment with a single air conditioner which hardly worked. Being Australian I had very little warm clothing so it was tough for me. It was really a rough few months and the thing that kept me going was support from my students and friends. I remember in particular I was wandering the campus one day trying to get out of the cold and a boy I had never met came up to me an thrust a big santa doll into my hands, said merry christmas with a big smile and then walked away. I never saw him again. I don't know if he can possibly know what a difference that made to my day, week and month. The kindness of strangers is indeed the true spirit of christmas.

As such, I'm kind of interested in what young Chinese people know or think about it.  
  
You can be in China (I'm not sure if you can visit reddit over there) or living in a foreign nation, but born in China.  
  
  
Here's a few questions I'm wondering, and feel free to branch out:  
  
(1) What did you learn in China about the Cultural Revolution? How much do you learn in schools? Do your parents talk about it? Is there much discussion on the internet within China? What are the impressions you get from these sources?  
  
(2) What do you think about the Cultural Revolution? Was it good, bad, neither? Have you had any foreign (non-Chinese) education on the subject? Has that changed your views?  
  
(3) How do you think it's affected China? Is China handling it well? How should China (as a government or a country) see the Cultural revolution as it becomes a modern state?  
  
Anyway, it's pretty open-ended, but these are some of the things I was thinking about. Thanks!

Her daughter died from a waist fracture after she jumped out of a second-story window in their home during the quake. The second floor of Lu Jinkang's house collapsed during the main jolt, and the first floor in the subsequent aftershocks, burying all her belongings. All she has left now is her son's daughter, Qing Qing, who was two months old when her father died.

Many redditors in [/r/China](/r/China) are foreigners, and often I see a lot of people trying to answer translation questions here by using Google.

Most crime isn't widely reported so the scope of an expanding problem in modern China is hard to access. This took place 2 days ago close to where I live:

A family wanted to build in a shared area between two houses. The neighbours refused due to building regulations and the fact that they would lose valuable space. The Builders family sent 2 people over to 'negotiate' with the husband, who ended up in hospital with a broken nose. Builders were ordered to pay a 4000 kuai compensation. Most of this stuff happened last week.

2 days ago, the husband of the Builders family comes back on behest of the wife. She tells him to go get the 4000 kuai back (lovely woman, clearly) and some other stuff which I guess was mainly made up to get the husband into action. He walks over with a hatchet, kills the family's 4 year old daughter -according to the witnesses who came running when the screaming began she wasn't even identifiable since her head was virtually chopped into little pieces. Then the Builder spots her 10 year old brother and proceeds with the same hatchet-to-the-head approach. While he's at it the mother comes running out and he kills her as well. Now the neighbours are all alarmed and to find the Builder husband searching the house for more people to kill, but due to the man still being at the hospital with his face injuries, he can't find any more. He runs off covered in blood. One day later he goes home to pick up some clothes and food where the police arrests him. 

I don't really know why I'm even writing this but I'm shocked to the core and have no place to vent really, also I can find no news story about this anywhere. 

So, fellow foreigners and Chinese. Take care, it's not always as safe as it's made out to be so try staying out of trouble and be aware that there are people who are willing to go very far for a few measly kuai.

EDIT: Prsquee found what seems to be a story on it. Some facts were slightly off but considering my crappy Chinese, what my friends told me pretty much was the gist of it. The article doesn't mention the woman sending for this man to come to Tengchong and do whatever she wanted him to. I hope she rots in jail for her part in this shitty story.",,False,,t5_2qh2v,True,,,True,t3_rr5rk,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/rr5rk/unbelievable_triple_murder_around_the_corner/,

Recently, Reddit has introduced Flair -- a little specialized tag next to your username when you post... For the sake of our subreddit, where so many people are in so many places, and from all around the world, we'd like to use flair to help us know a little about each other. 

Here's how it will work: 

* We will use ⌂ for your home and ✈ for where you live now... 
* You don't have to be specific if you don't want to be, and you don't have to include both if you don't want to. Your privacy is up to you, and we don't want to encroach on that at all.
* You can use Chinese characters if you feel so inclined
* For example: ⌂ Boston ✈ Shanghai; ⌂ 山东省; ⌂ China ✈ UK; etc...

- The area of Wanshang County is being removed, leading the residents to lash out, especially against the change in/disappearance of their social welfare
- About 100,000 people fighting, ""thousands"" of police
- A few people have died (1 man, 1 child)
- Teargas, batons, hot water, tasers, etc... have been used
- Student rallies blocking highways
- Mobile phones and online news are down

A few weekends ago we met up with a few Redditors (and friends) to make the ~2 hour journey out to Wonderland. It was a foggy day, which made the trip even more ominous. It took two trains and a long bus ride, but was definitely worth it. 

We'd heard rumors of security guards, but there was nobody and the front gates and multiple ways around the side to get in. There were a few other people strolling around taking pictures as well, and we even ran into some school children.

The park consists of the wall / gates buildings, which are long and very creepy inside. Behind those are a few empty buildings, filled with graffiti. There was some pretty cool terraces, and  we could even get onto the roof. Then farther back past some old corn fields is a huge unfinished metal structure. And all the way in the back is the concrete castle most photos show. You can walk around behind the castle and explore the lower area, but it was dark and there were some kids inside so instead we scaled the front wall. From there there are two spiral staircases that go all the way up to the top. The view from the atop spires was amazing.

After we got married, we moved back to China. We have been living in China for two years and it has been very challenging for both of us. I have worked in the States for two years and have to come back because of visa issues. I have posted here asking for advice of dealing with depression for my husband. Unfortunately, living in China is just too challenging for both of us and we have built resentment towards each other. As it is right now, my marriage is falling apart. He thinks Chinese don't think on their own and it is pure laziness in thinking. He thinks I am very Chinese, just like the rest of people he has to deal with outside of home, which makes him sick. He said he cannot take this, therefore he want to divorce with me. 

I will be very honest and say Chinese in general are lack of critical thinking ability. I spent two years in the States, but is wasn't enough time for me to really learn the cultural and thinking. Part of the reason I left China was because I want to learn more about western thinking. Coming back to China is a very big reverse culture shock to me and I have been avoiding to deal with my feelings. 

With this divorce coming ahead, I decide instead of mourning for my divorce, I would like to look into what I can improve on my part.

I guess I'm just looking for good stories... Don't know if this thread will take off or not but if you know some nut job let me know. 


I'll start, I knew a guy who claimed:

*His uncle was a star goalkeeper for Liverpool

*He worked in politics back home

*Was a former detective

*He could ski jump 

*He lost a relative to the Haiti earthquake

*Lost a relative to the Japan tsunami

*Lost multiple relatives in a Bin Laden overseen airplane bombing (No specifics)

Self-diagnosed with:

*Pre-heart attack symptoms

*Liver failure

1359741815.0,27,self.China,17petc,Chinese BF Update -- Day 42,Browncoat101,49,22,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/17petc/chinese_bf_update_day_42/,"Now that I'm thinking about the title of my first post, it does seem a little off. Anyway, some of you asked me to keep you updated, and in fact, things have changed a bit since I wrote my first post [found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/176g7w/working_my_way_to_a_chinese_bf/). I'm now going to pretend I'm an anthropologist studying a lost tribe. Or a woman, looking for a boyfriend.

The only reason I post this here is because it's a followup to my last post, and it has to do with someone with a Mainland mentality. As opposed to an ABC or person living in the States. I'll happily move it if it's in the wrong place. Or you guys think it's dumb. You know, which ever.

Anyway, so, there's this guy, but I'm not exactly sure if he's interested in me. We met at an English corner of all places, and then lost contact, and then a few months ago, I was looking into buying a Nook (didn't), and he offered to help me. From there he invited me to a few more English corners, and a weekly game night. Usually he picks me up from the bus stop (which is not weird, or romantic at all, Chinese people are awesome to guests, usually). And we talk as we're walking, or at the English Corner or whatever. The other thing is that we text a lot. Sometimes I initiate, but more often lately, he's initiated. We just talk about whatever, life and stuff, and that's pretty normal. 

I think he's a great guy, but I didn't think he saw me as relationship material. Just because he was inviting me to English corners, I didn't bother getting my hopes up. And once afterward it was late, and I suggested we get dinner, and he told me he'd ""rather eat alone."" Again, I didn't think too much about it, but I was a little disappointed. We talk on qq pretty often, and I introduced him to Quentin Tarantino, who he really liked, and Jackie Brown which he loved (I watched it a week before he did, and I loved it, too). 

Wow, this is getting long. Anyway, earlier this week we went to ktv (which I think actually fun, so bite me) and he was hanging out with a bunch of teachers and students who are out for the New Year, so he had to leave early. He didn't say goodbye to me, so, I figured, it's cool, we're just friends, no biggie (yes, I got all that from him not saying goodbye. Curse my female mind!) But later he sent me a text saying goodnight and goodbye, and he hoped to see me the next night (game night). 

Cut to last night. We had a great time with a bunch of other people. I was adorable as usual :P At one point he asked me what kind of body shape I like in a guy (because one of the Americans that was with us was super swole), and I was like, just regular (because it's true), and I thought the question was kind of random. I also invited him (the whole table, honestly) to come to my campus to see it (because it's actually really pretty with lots of natural features), but in a vague ""you should see it"" kind of way. And he basically was like, ""Yes! As soon as you're back in town, I'm going to come."" with an enthusiasm which seemed more than usual. Then it was about midnight, and everybody started heading out. I was exhausted because I went to bed at around three the night before (ktv), and didn't want to move just yet. Then I told them I'd leave when {name redacted} left. I started to get up a few minutes later, and he said no rush, we could leave when I was ready. We proceeded to chat until three in the morning. About relationships and family, and our pasts, and stuff. Just the regular getting to know you stuff. At one point he asked me how many guys I hang out with, and I answered (truthfully) only the guys at the game nights, which were him, two Americans, and an Indian guy. So, I looked at my watch at three, and was like, ""Don't you have to work tomorrow? Why did you let me do this?!?!"" (laughingly). And he was like, ""Well, you're going out of town for spring festival, so I won't see you for two weeks..."" And I was really touched.

Then he sent me a message tonight wishing me a good journey. We chatted a little more before I told him I had to go to bed.

If this were the States, I'd have no doubt that this guy had something going for me (if he weren't gay, that is, {name redacted} isn't. At least I hope he's not). So, I'm going to see how it plays out. I don't know what signs I should be looking for or whatever, but I feel like something is happening. He's texted me a couple times when I was out of town wondering when I'd be back in, and even my girlfriends don't do that. So, maybe, the advice to just be myself, and put myself out there won the day? We'll see. Anyway, it's just pure speculation and nothing remotely official yet, but if you've read this far and still care, I'll probably update something in the future.

**TLDR;** Lady issues, does he like me?, This is China, advice plz, etc. ad infinitum.

**Edit 1**: {name redacted} is the name of the guy I'm crushing on. (Yes, that's so nineties a box of Ecto Cooler just appeared in your pocket. You're welcome.)

**Edit 2**: I'm thinking on enlisting the help of an American guy who's our mutual friend. Maybe doing the subtle, ""Sooooo, does (friend) have any thoughts about me?""",,False,,t5_2qh2v,1359790509.0,,us,True,t3_17petc,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/17petc/chinese_bf_update_day_42/,

(Here's the [link](http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2012-11/china-mittelschicht-lebensplanung), however it's all in German) The article is talking on the one hand about the ""American Dream""-like possibilities that the next generations of young Chinese could have, basically making it from poor peasant life to upper middle class level through their own hard work (sort of a Chinese 'rags-to-riches'). Giving as an example the story of a young guy whose parents were too poor to pay for his school, but who eventually passed his *gaokao* through working by day and studying at night and thus opening up all these opportunities to himself. However the article makes the point that success stories like these are mere exceptions which are promoted by the government. In reality, the author says, this ""Chinese Dream"" is more or less a big lie because there are too many factors that keep people from actually pursuing their goals, saying that *hukou* keeps them from moving to the big cities and getting good jobs, that *guanxi* favors those with the better connections not those with the better grades or best qualifications, or that in general there is to much pressure and competition out there, which makes most of young Chinese people actually afraid and insecure as to what they actually can achieve.
I found the article pretty interesting but I'm wondering now about whether the article is exaggerating about both the existence of a ""chinese dream"" on the one side and its governmentally promoted 'fake-ness' on the other side.

Today when approaching a crosswalk in Wudaokou (Beijing) I saw a man laying in the road near the corner, I watched as 20-30 people made a big circle around the guy and pretended not to see him and a bunch of cars also circled around the unusual obstacle in their path. 

I got to the corner and still no one had even so much as stopped to see why this man, big bag splayed out on the ground beside him, had fallen and not gotten back up. Admitedly he was pretty 'migrant worker'  looking and my first thought was ""Probably drunk..."" but still...

I went over and squatted down, he had some scrapes on his face so he must have fallen down and not just laid down nicely. I tried shaking his shoulder gently and he was completely limp and no movement so I checked his pulse and he was still alive, I shook him again gently and I saw his eye and nose twitch, after a couple more shakes he came to. 

I said in Chinese that he was in the road with cars everywhere and he couldn't stay there. He moaned and looked around dazed, barely able to lift his head. I told him I would help him up and he groaned. wasn't sure if I should so I just stayed squatted beside him to see if he was functional. Saw a couple pairs of legs appear near me so I looked up and the police had showed up. I stood up and told them he fell and seemed injured, they continued glaring at me and the one guy made a ""move along"" motion, so I moved along. I was already pissed that the police were kind of dickish but whatever I figured, did a good deed today. 

This lady stops me while I'm crossing the street and I am ready to say with great humility ""oh no, it was nothing!"" and she glares at me and tells me I should never help people like that. The guy fell onto the pavement in the middle of a busy street corner, is laying there in the middle of winter on the freezing bloody cold cement for who knows how long, and she's bitching at me that I'm an idiot for checking on the guy. 

And Yes, I know all about the Nanjing incident with the idiotic judge, In the Billions and billions of times that people have helped each other in public, you are bound to have a couple idiots, that doesn't mean you stop helping each other... What if that man had been her grandfather?

And no, I'm not saying all Chinese are bad or anything like that, most Chinese I meet are very wonderful people, just very frustrated right now, I think the lady afterwards just made it that much worse. I can understand not helping the guy, it happens all over, but to then come up to someone who does help him and tell him not to do it again... 

Then if that wasn't enough, I went to an Ice Festival in the South West of Beijing. Good bit of fun and brought two of my friends little cousins who had never been sledding and such before. To go sledding there you have to walk up the side while dragging your sled, not a giant hill but a decent size slope anyway. Mostly I stayed at the bottom and took pictures but went up with the one cousin and in front of me was a big line of people waiting to go up who weren't moving, I looked at the front and there was this 6 or 7 year old trying to pull their sleigh up but it was caught on a chunk of snow and the kid couldn't pull hard enough, there was an bloody line of people standing there, getting angry, one actually said ""Kuai dian..."" to the kid... and not one single person had the decency to walk up and help the child. I had to push my way to the front, getting many angry glares, and help the kid. 

Second time I went up a lady, a couple places in front of me had her child in her one arm, and was trying to focus on the child, her feet (very icy and hard to walk on) and pull the sleigh while everyone watched... She just about fell twice with the child in her arms.. I picked up her sleigh and carried it up to the top for her. 

Again. I know not all Chinese are this way... but fuck me... today was apparently the ""Fuck Everyone Else"" day and no one told me... I've seen a lot of frustrating shit over the past 8 years but today just killed me, what I wrote here is only 3 of just repeatedly, blatant ignorance towards each other I saw today.

tl;dr: Today killed me with repeated incidents of people being just dickish to each other. Very frustrated.",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,t3_p0hsq,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/p0hsq/be_excellent_to_each_other/,

""Mmmm Boy,"" I thought, ""Delicious Asian pastries, complete with fancy packaging."" 

I was new in China and wanted to assimilate. Surely there was no better way to absorb a foreign culture than to eat its food. So I delicately and respectfully opened the gold inlayed red packaging. Inside, resting in red faux-velvet bunkers, sat four round and golden mooncakes each covered in intricate and mysterious pastry-fied calligraphy. They were so beautiful I'd just as soon cherish them as keepsakes; but, I was hungry and pastries, no matter how beautiful, were meant for eating. 

I lifted up one of the velvet treats and brought it close to my face for closer inspection. It was heavy and golden brown. I spun it front of eyes examining as closely as an appraiser might inspect a piece of valuable antiquity. No smell, I noticed. 

I brought it to my mouth and nibbled at the crust. Butter? Sesame? There was some sort of white paste, thick like Marzipan!
""Mmm, Marzipan!"" I could resist temptation no longer, opening my mouth wide, I bit half way into the mooncake. 

Surprise rankled through me. Where's that wonderful almond flavor of the marzipan? What's that slight oily flavor crawling up my nose? Fish?!? FISH! The glory of the pastry had been defiled, corrupted. In my mouth sat something vile. The old fish permeated the marzipan like paste. I tongued something. Something hard. It was a fish bone. 

My stomach roiled and I gagged. The mooncake slid from my mouth into my hand leaving behind a thin bridge of saliva.

""Welcome to China,"" the fancy mooncake box seemed to say with a wrinkled brow and sly, oblong smile. 

My eyes narrowed and I crossed my arms. ""Alright,"" I said to myself, ""no one said cultural immersion would be easy. Challenge accepted.""

I discarded the slop in my hand and tossed the rest of the fishy mooncake into my mouth. It was foul, but I forced it down anyways, paste, fish and bone. 

I breathed heavy and puffed out my chest. Three more to go. I pulled out another mooncake and gave it a thorough examination. It was lighter in weight and color; the calligraphy atop was different. But when I bit in once again there was that same flavorless paste. But wait, it was slightly sweet. My eyebrows raised in question. I chewed slowly and examined the hole that my bite had left in the moon cake. My teeth had left marks through the paste. In the center, in place of the fish and bones was something yellow. I scooped a bit out with my finger and looked closer. I smelled it, and licked it. Egg yolk. I happily finished the rest of it, almost enjoying the flavor.

The third mooncake was the same as second, but in place of the yolk was a sour plum like fermented fruit.

My stomach had turned to lead. I feared for my bowels as I went fourth and final mooncake. With a breath, I lifted to my mouth and bit in. Nut and dried fruit sensations and textures filled my mouth. A sugary salty combination of joy. Despite the flavor each bite was a labor or love and determination. 

Afterwards, I was constipated for three days. But now, as I approach every Mid-Autumn Festival I look forward to the mooncakes and the surprises they always bring.

Maybe it was just that Hong Kong seemed too neat and orderly and clean. All the well-dressed people rushing around at near running pace. That without all the Asian faces many places in the city could look like a typical American city's downtown.

first, ive had thousands of cash transactions in the past few years, and this is only my second fake bill. youll probably get targeted more as a foreigner, but in general don't think that there are fake bills everywhere.

second, the sketchier the situation, the more likely you'll get a fake bill. people who look poor, people at small street stands, blaxis, taxis in second and lower tier cities, be on the lookout. first tier dept stores will never give you fake cash

ok, so how do you tell what is fake cash? chinese currency has a number of security features, but some of them are difficult to notice unless you are really familiar with the currency or if you have a fake and a real to compare. by far the easiest way is to scratch mao's collar. turn the bill to the side of mao's portrait. his collar is colored in with raised parallel lines. those grooves you're scratching indicates a real bill. now scratch the left side where there's a blank white space. that's smooth, and it's how fake bills will feel when you scratch the fake collar. this is by far the most expedient way to check for fake bills. 

dont assume that only 100s and 50s are faked. for me, it was a 20 and a 10

finally, there's a well known scam where the salesperson takes your real cash, switch it out for a counterfeit, and return the counterfeit to you and demanding a real bill. watch out for that. just keep a close eye on the money until the transaction is complete.

o right, what if you get stuck with a fake bill? if you notice in time, you're well in your rights to request a change. if not, your best bet is to pawn it off in quick and busy transactions. mopeds, kfc at rush hour are good choices. altenatively keep it as a memento. don't go to the police: they won't be able to do much, and you're just inviting the hassle of police forms.

Im 20, Taiwanese, and work at a KTV bar in 常平鎮，東莞市，深圳. Dongguan is the sex capital of China, btw if u didnt know alrdy.

My family was pretty rich i guess, like upper middle class. When i was 14 they sent me to a boarding school in the UK bc they cant control me in TW, Halfway thru I dropped out and flew back to TW, and then eventually Shenzhen when I was 17. Then i have like no fking money left so I basically live in 网吧s (internet bar) all day. No fking clue how but i got a girlfriend even wit my poor ass and i moved into a tiny aparttment with her. We lived on mantou all day and just fucked.

Okay eventually I got a job as a webcam performer. http://www.6.cn/ No naked ro anything just chat and flirt with a bunch of girls and a bunch of gay guys lmbo. But if ur funny and cute and u got a good program people buy you presents, which r like little pictures that flash up for 3 seconds. AND YES they pay 100 yuan or even 1000 yuan for this kind of stff lol. So eventually I started mking like 10000 yuan a month, which is a LOTTA money for someon who just eats baozi and mantou all day. but it was FCKING HARD to earn that much bc most are girl hosts and guy watchers. but i did it.

Neway, thats when I started going to KTV and partying a lot. I guess Im a pretty face and tall so a lota girls liked me, shenzhen is so close so i went alot. My gf...we broke up obviously.

Neway wth the webcam job I meet a lot of guys and I get them tocome KTV party with me, and then also saunas, and then i realized eeverybody I know is either prostitute or visits prostitutes or is a prostitute manager. Neway one of my regular girls tells me I should just work there as a manager, and bang Im in lmbo. Plus they think taiwan accent is hawt

So Ive working as KTV manager for last 6 months. Everything is commission and its basically just making connections and getting sales and getting the 关系. Its having been hard work but its fun too.

The girls are mostly nice but they get fucked up in the head rly fast but cant get out bc theyre used to the money alrdy. Its not all nice ahd happy like that 老外 said lmbo. Can he even talk Chinese LMBO???

1350885056.0,27,self.China,11vtlf,Can China really follow the Singaporean development model?,whocares65,31,4,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/11vtlf/can_china_really_follow_the_singaporean/,"Another day, [another article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/world/asia/many-urge-chinas-next-leader-to-enact-reform.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=world) about China's upcoming power transfer and speculation over future development. In short, future president Xi Jinping has given indications that he supports reform.

What I'm surprised by is the use of the term ""Singapore model"". For a long time now the (Western) media has been talking about a ""China model"". Even China's leaders have, since the 2008-09 financial crisis, trumpeted the failures of the Washington Consensus and contrasted it with the successes of China's own path of development. During this time it's been tempting to believe that the Chinese had figured everything out, and in any case the term ""Singapore model"" was rarely, if ever, used. ""With Chinese characteristics"" seemed to be the preferred catchphrase, whether used seriously (by the government) or jokingly (by netizens). Therefore, I'm curious as to what the renewed focus on a ""Singapore model"" means. 

China has been fascinated by Singapore's success story [since Deng's time](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/09/weekinreview/the-world-china-sees-singapore-as-a-model-for-progress.html). Beyond economics, Lee Kuan Yew's idea of ""Asian values"" was just the ideology China needed to counter international criticism. The Chinese public is particularly fond of Singapore, with many Chinese celebrities (e.g. Jet Li, Gong Li) becoming Singaporean citizens; many netizens viewed the Singaporean prime minister's [warning about Chinese perceptions of the US](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/world/asia/singapores-prime-minister-warns-china-on-view-of-us.html) as a ""betrayal"", indicating that the Chinese believe Singapore to be on their side internationally.

So it makes sense for China to admire the Singapore model. But can China really emulate it? I'm not convinced. China finds the Singaporean model attractive because of

1. De-facto one-party rule
2. Economic prosperity
3. Tough laws and regulations leading to a clean, orderly society
4. An ethnic Chinese majority

But here's the thing: I don't think the Singapore model scales up well. The methods used to govern a city-state won't all work when applied to a country of 1.3 billion. 

For example, it's easy to keep tabs on opposition parties within a single city and make sure they don't gain too much support (even though this seems to be [getting less effective](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-05-26/singapore-opposition-wins-by-election-to-retain-parliament-seat)). It's a whole other thing to do it in a huge country. It's easy to police a city to the extent that public spitting and bubblegum-chewing are banned, it's completely impractical to do it for a larger territory since you're bound to meet opposition somewhere. 

Beyond that, Singapore has many traits that China is pretty much the opposite of:

1. State support for cultural, ethnic, and linguistic diversity
2. A robust legal system
3. High immigrant population (~42% non-citizens)
3. High public salaries and correspondingly low rates of corruption

In short, I think China's talk of aping Singapore is a classic case of not seeing the flip side of the coin (光看贼吃肉， 没见贼挨打). It's akin to the  American public's admiration of Nordic countries. Nice to think about, but completely unrealistic to implement.

Some of the characters I stumbled across: a part time architect/bicycle shop owner, a girl who works just enough to finance her next travel adventure and is perpetually broke, a guy who spends his days in coffee shops making music with friends (and not the child of wealth), a med-school and communist party dropout who was saving up as a hostel employee to open his own, and on and on.  All happy, content and hilarious - not apparently soul crushed by the burdon of Chinese society.  So many interesting people, living a life which westerners would find very familiar.  
  
  
Where are stories of Chinese people like this?  I would love to read more about people like these.  If anyone has a source on articles, blogs, books etc. send them my way.

This response makes me feel like she a) doesn't think it's a big deal and/or b) expects me to read what she put together, analyze it, and summarize it....in other words, do her work for her.

The internet seems to be suggesting that plagiarism is not taken as seriously in China.  How true is this, and how can I diplomatically tell her that what she has done is unacceptable/career-ending here?  How can I tell her that however bad she thinks her English is, she has to read, analyze, and summarize different sources, without spending the rest of my semester basically teaching her how to write a research paper (which I don't exactly have time for)?

I'd like to be culturally sensitive, but when she says, ""I did it that way because I am not good at writing,"" it makes me feel like she is just slacking off and hoping I will do her work for her, and my American/New Jersey attitude starts to drown out my cultural sensitivity.

The assignment is due in about 12 hours, so I might just end up leaving her sections blank.  (It's a draft submission, so that won't be a huge problem.)  But this is the first of several assignments in this group project, so any advice you guys have will definitely still be useful!

Thanks!

**UPDATE**: I sent her an email that said I couldn't use her contributions in the report because she sent me blatant plagiarism and we could all get expelled.  I then went on to explain the concepts of plagiarism, paraphrasing, quotation marks, proper citation format, etc.  Finally I told her that luckily, because it was only a draft version, I just submitted it without her sections and suspect that won't be too much of a problem, but that she needs to fix her contributions for next time.

She replied, and her first sentence was, ""Thanks, yes, of course its not allowed to copy.""  So, maybe that is an encouraging sign?  Then she went on a big explanation that sort of just went into more detail about how she expected me to do her work for her.  ""I copied that because I was worried I would explain it wrong."" and ""I sent you that passage of 2 pages so you could read it and pick out interesting facts when you are writing the report.""  She did however end by saying  ""I feel sorry that I didn't do more things in this part:(...But I will do more in next step!""

Of course, I won't get too excited until I actually see what she does in the next step, and I'm going to run anything suspicious through Google, but all in all, this is probably the most encouraging response that could be expected.

Thanks for the advice, and sorry that all of you looking for blood don't get a juicier ending (....yet).",,False,,t5_2qh2v,1354546569.0,,,True,t3_145rkw,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/145rkw/my_chinese_groupmate_is_plagiarizingadvice/,

http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/chinas-limits-reducing-tensions-japan

**Summary**

Some 1,000 Chinese fishing vessels are reportedly on their way to the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands after the end of a Chinese ban on fishing and an announcement by the Chinese fisheries administration that it will provide protection and assistance for Chinese finishing boats around the disputed islands. The boats set sail as large (and at times violent) anti-Japanese protests spread throughout Chinese cities, leading several Japanese companies to announce at least temporary suspensions of operations in China.

To make matters worse, this event is taking place just days ahead of the 81st anniversary of the Mukden Incident, which triggered Japan's invasion of Manchuria in the years leading up to World War II. But as the Chinese government rallies the population and stirs nationalist fervor to distract the public from domestic affairs, Beijing may soon find itself unable to back down from the dispute.

**A Useful Distraction**

Beijing quickly seized upon the Japanese government's Sept. 12 decision to buy three of the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands (there are five total) from their private Japanese owner in order to shift national attention away from China's domestic problems. These include the upcoming generational leadership transition, slowing economic growth, increased public awareness of corruption in the Communist Party and government and growing international criticism of China's assertive actions in the South China Sea. Keeping Chinese citizens focused on the perennial Japanese ""aggressor"" helped to distract them from the numerous issues at home.

**The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands Dispute**

Anti-Japanese protests quickly broke out in Chinese cities, often with the assistance of the local governments and security forces. The demonstrations grew to massive proportions over the weekend, affecting at least 85 cities across China. In major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing, protesters marched outside Japanese diplomatic compounds amid a heavy security presence, which largely prevented violence. In Xian, one of the cities that led anti-Japanese protests in 2005 and 2010, tens of thousands of people marched to the city's center on the morning of Sept. 15. The protest turned violent as Japanese-made cars were overturned and smashed and Japanese restaurants and shops were attacked. In the southern city of Changsha, protesters set fires in the streets and attacked and looted a large Japanese-owned department store. The scene was similar in a number of other cities, including Qingdao, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.

Although the government and official media outlets have maintained the steady stream of strong, patriotic and at times inflammatory rhetoric, the government is now trying to regain control over the protests. The official Xinhua news agency published an article Sept. 17 entitled ""Wisdom Needed in the Expression of Patriotism,"" which warned the public to be rational and obey the law during protests. Some local public security bureaus are also beginning to take a stronger approach to dealing with the protesters. Guangzhou's public security bureau announced Sept. 17 that at least 10 rioters had been detained by police forces after they smashed Japanese vehicles and vandalized Japanese shops. In Xian, public gatherings, demonstrations and marches lacking official approval are now strictly prohibited. But the state continues to make numerous statements concerning its rights to the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands and highlighting Japan's purported violation of Chinese sovereignty.

**Problems with Backing Down**

A major problem for China is that the government has framed the Japanese move not as an administrative action that simply shifted ownership of the islands from a private Japanese citizen to the government (which had already been renting the islands to ensure that nobody was allowed to build or land on them), but rather as the Japanese taking something that was under Chinese control. In fact, the islands have long been under Japanese -- not Chinese -- control, but portraying the issue in this manner served domestic political needs. Chinese officials, who have stirred up the protests and declared that they will defend Chinese sovereignty, now find that their ability to de-escalate the situation is limited since any de-escalation could be seen as weakness and capitulation to the Japanese.

Beijing has already warned that there will be economic ramifications if Japan does not back down on its claim to the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. Nearly a quarter of all Japanese overseas non-manufacturing enterprises are in China, and Japanese exports to China in 2011 amounted to $161.4 billion. Additionally, Chinese tourists account for more than 40 percent of foreign tourists to Japan. However, China would not be unaffected by a serious economic conflict with Japan. China had a $22 billion trade surplus with Japan in 2011, while Japanese firms account for 4 percent of incoming foreign direct investment in China and Japanese businesses directly employ one million Chinese workers. Attacks on Japanese cars and businesses also harm the Chinese citizens who own and operate many of them, and several Japanese companies are now considering temporarily suspending operations in China -- or worse, reducing or ending such operations, which could lead companies from other countries to follow suit.

Another problem for Beijing is that, as in previous waves of anti-Japanese protests, the protests may begin with patriotic fervor but they can quickly take on a mob mentality or provide an opening for demonstrations against other issues, such as government corruption and social grievances. Already there are signs of this -- though sporadic -- in the current protests. Anti-government forces or citizens looking to bring their own issues to the table can exploit the mass of individuals on the streets -- something Beijing is much less willing to tolerate. Attempts to rein in protests, if too aggressive, can quickly shift attention away from Japan and the island dispute and toward the Chinese government itself.

Beijing knows Tokyo will not change its administrative control over the islands, even if Japanese officials attempt to reduce tensions by seeking fisheries and other economic talks with Taiwan or China. And both sides have, at least thus far, shown some restraint by sending coast guard and fisheries administration ships to the islands instead of naval vessels. For China's leadership, there is a benefit to keeping the patriotic protests active and keeping the Diaoyu/Senkaku issue front and center, at least until the leadership transition is complete next March. But the longer the protests are allowed to go on, the more likely they are to change focus and the more likely Beijing is to lose control of them. Yet, by framing the issue as one of active Japanese usurpation of Chinese territory, it is difficult to see where and how Beijing can step back without being seen as weak by the Chinese people. And at a time of political transition, being seen as weak is not something the Communist Party can allow.",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,t3_1029ll,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1029ll/chinas_limits_in_reducing_tensions_with_japan/,

What can Japan and China do to ease tensions in the East China Sea?  What is China’s biggest challenge with U.S. relations? These questions and many more were addressed in a Feb. 13 talk by Kenneth Lieberthal, one of the world’s leading China experts and a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan.

Lieberthal’s lecture was part of the Policy Talks series at U-M’s Ford School of Public Policy  and was co-sponsored by the International Policy Center.

From 1983 to 2009, Lieberthal taught political science and business administration at U-M.  He also served as special assistant to President Clinton for national security affairs and was senior director for Asia on the National Security Council from 1998-2000. He is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. His latest book, Bending History: Barack Obama’s Foreign Policy (co-authored with Martin Indyk and Michael O’Hanlon), was published by the Brookings Press in March 2012.

A video of Lieberthal’s entire talk  at the Ford School is available here.

Here are a few edited excerpts from his wide-ranging presentation:

China and the latest North Korean nuclear test

“What constrains China is two things in regard to North Korea. One is that it’s very, very difficult for a big state to tell a little state what it should do and how to do it. Just think of Cuba. Forget Cuba, think Haiti. We have these itsy bitsy places, very near the U.S. southern border that have not lacked U.S. attention over the years, and we’ve never been able to get them to do what we want them to do.”

“In addition, China is constrained because, while we don’t fear instability in Cuba, China does fear instability in North Korea. Big time. And what they fear is that what they will end up with is a unified nuclear Korean peninsula in bed with the United States. That’s a terrible outcome from their perspective.”

“I think in fact there are some things China can do, but they aren’t exactly what we’ve been calling on them to do. We tend to focus on U.N. resolutions and imposing more sanctions on North Korea. Frankly, we’ve run out of sanctions. We’ve sanctioned everything in North Korea. It doesn’t make much difference because they don’t do much with the rest of the world. But I think there are some things China can do.”

“In the U.N., they (China) should support a resolution. It won’t be quite as harsh as it otherwise would have been. Get the Chinese to sign off on it the best they can and praise them for doing it.”

Three things China can do

“Quietly say to them we have two big asks. One is: The North Korean nuclear and missile program – my understanding is – is organically tied to the Iranian nuclear and missile program. The two nuclear programs have been joined at the hip for years. So when North Korea tests a nuclear weapon – I don’t know this for sure – but I think there’s a good chance the data are going to Iran, so they don’t have to do the test. That’s a huge threat. My sense of geography is that you can’t fly from North Korea to Iran without landing in China or at least crossing Chinese air space. So suppose we go to the Chinese and say, ‘Don’t let any North Korean or Iranian planes fly from one country to the other across Chinese air space.’ That would be one way to kill two birds with one stone. You don’t have to make an announcement. But it would wake up leaders in both countries big time.”

“Secondly, China should begin delaying and disrupting Chinese supplies to North Korea. Not by joining any sanctions. Just things don’t show up. Having problems with the rail system. You’ll just have to wait. No problem. It’ll come. North Korea will get the message in 24 hours. If they continue, you ratchet it up a little bit. No one’s face is involved. If you do it publicly, there’s face involved.”

“The third thing I would do is see if the Xi (Jinping) administration is willing to sit down with us and South Korea and talk about what we do if there is a dramatic contingency in North Korea. Not that we need to act together. But we should know what each other is thinking about – what are our plans. For example, if there were a real collapse in North Korea, you could be sure the PLA has contingencies to move into parts of the country, to pacify it and to try to identify where the nuclear materials are and to prevent mass refugee flows into China. Well, guess what. The U.S. and South Korea have similar plans. It would not be surprising to learn that there are parts of North Korea that both militaries would have operational orders to seize and hold. If we’re not talking to each other, we could end up shooting at each other, which is not an outcome anyone wants to have. We have never had a conversation with China about long-tern contingencies in North Korea. Never. ”

Easing tensions between Japan and China 

“I don’t think China and Japan are going to start shooting at each other as an act of conscious policy. Both of them realize if there is a real conflict, their economic relationship will tank, and that will have dramatically negative consequences for both of them. This is not like dealing with the Philippines and the Chinese economy. This is huge and the Chinese are very sensitive to that. But they now have a situation around these islands – called the Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese.”

“The danger here is that there are enough boats and enough planes increasingly challenging each other, just by their presence, that there could well be an accident or an incident. If that occurs, this will turn instantaneously into a whole different problem.”

“I think what they have to do is – it’s too early to try to get governments to negotiate this; there’s too much face and too much passion – to get some of the elders from each side who have known each for many years and trust each other and who have commanded respect from the current leaders in each of their respective countries. Have them get together and not work out a final resolution but work on steps that each can take unilaterally to pull back, to get these boats farther away from each other and not have planes over there at the same time, so that you reduce dramatically the chances of an accident and create the space necessary to begin to engage government to government, to try to get some workable agreement. It will not resolve sovereignty. Sovereignty is very  difficult to negotiate.”",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,t3_18urca,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/18urca/lieberthal_on_china_north_korea_us_and_japan/,
