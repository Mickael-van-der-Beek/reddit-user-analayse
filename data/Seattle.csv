Also, the racism in their IRC channel is disgraceful.   ",dictator_careless,692,210,558,http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/11l6z9/the_moderators_of_rseattle_consistently_allow/,"Don't just take my word for it. Take a look at their user history or pop into the IRC channel on the sidebar. radpanda, pretendperson, and their friends make fun of Mexicans, African Americans, and Jews very often. It's ridiculous.

This post will likely get a series of immediate downvotes by the trolls that hang in IRC all day, and I wouldn't be surprised if the moderators ban me. (Which is why I'm using an alt account for this)

Suggestions:

* remove the IRC channel from the sidebar. It just serves as a place for upvote and downvote brigades.

* remove the rules from /r/Seattle and just follow the [reddiquette](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette). If the moderators and their friends don't have to follow the rules, why do the rules exist for everyone else?

EDIT: Sorry I've been working all day. I am glad this post received attention. As you can see in the comments our friends careless, radpanda, and pretendperson are doing their usual thing: /u/careless is defending his friends and censoring those who disagree with them, while /u/radpanda and /u/pretendperson are continuing to be insulting and racist like it's just a big joke. Look at their user history for more proof of their abuse and misuse. And see [this](http://i.imgur.com/2tUQh.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/wyXf2.jpg) too.

EDIT2: Someone private messaged me and said she has been harassed and name-called by radpanda at a past Reddit meetup. I won't say anything more about her story because she probably doesn't want to be ID'ed and that's why she didn't comment. But please everyone, if you have stories to share, do it now!

EDIT3: Even the people in the comments defending the IRC channel agree that radpanda and pretendperson are odd fellows, but they say the racism is just a joke. No, it's not. It's still racism. And /r/Seattle should not be supporting it by linking to it.

EDIT4: I received some private messages about more radpanda and careless antics. Here they are, with identifying information removed.

I know the SPD (very deservedly) gets a lot of flack for being violent and/or racist.

Today while we were walking through Pioneer Square she saw a mounted officer. She doesn't make it into the city nearly as much as I do and had never seen a cop on a horse so we stopped for her to geek out for a minute.

There was a black man who appeared to be just this side of homeless selling things laid out on a blanket on the street corner. The cop rode up to him and said something I couldn't make out. I assumed he was asking for some sort of permit, about to tell the street vendor to move on. Instead the black man chuckled, said something about a smoke to which the officer pulled out a pack of cigarettes and instead of just giving the man one, he handed him the rest of the pack, said something in a friendly tone and rode off while the street vendor replied with an enthusiastic thanks.

Of course there are no news cameras rushing in to get this interaction out to the public. It doesn't vindicate any cops who've committed crimes against civilians for any reason. It's just nice to be aware that some of them aren't out there to kick every minority in the ribs they can get to the ground for any reason.

1306848695.0,418,self.Seattle,ho7n6,I wrote the Seattle Police Department for clarification regarding the legality filming police officers. This was their response.,,473,55,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/ho7n6/i_wrote_the_seattle_police_department_for/,"This was my letter:

Firstly, I would like to thank everyone at the SPD for all of their hard work and dedication to the city of Seattle. Our streets are safer because of you. 

The reason I am writing to you is because I have a question I would like to have definitively answered: are citizens allowed to film police carrying out their duties? 

1) If filming an officer carrying out his official duties is unlawful, could you please cite the Washington state RCW so that others like myself may better understand our rights and responsibilities? 

2.) If filming an officer carrying out his official duties is lawful under Washington state law, how should concerned citizens respond to police officers who unlawfully ask them to turn off their cameras or delete images? 

And this was their response:
 
In a public place, generally there is no legal prohibition to filming officers performing their duties, just as there is no prohibition to simply observing officers in the same situation.  However, whether filming or observing, the activity cannot interfere with the officers duties.  For the officers safety, the officers attention should not be distracted from the person or situation they are dealing with so the officers can tell you to stay back a reasonable distance.  This  can vary depending on the circumstances and the risk of the situation they are investigating (e. g. move back several feet, across the street or down the block).  Failure to do so could constitute Obstructing a Public Officer (see SMC 12A.16.010). The officers request must be reasonable, but it may be based on information about the situation that you are not aware of, such as the possibility of a weapon –  so the request may be for your safety, but that may not be apparent at the time.   Also keep in mind that any audio recording you are making could violate the privacy right of the citizen being contacted (see RCW 9.73.020).
 
I cannot think of a reason you should be asked to destroy a recording.  However, if the recording could have evidentiary value, the recording could be requested as evidence and your destruction or deletion of any part of it could be destruction of evidence under the Obstruction code cited above.
 
So in summary, filming officers while on duty in public is not prohibited.  But, the officers do have a right to maintain an appropriate and reasonable safety zone that may involve reasons that they may not be able to explain to you immediately. Also, my answers only address the specific activity of filming the officers.  Keep in mind that other words, actions or behaviors by the person making the recording have a direct relationship to how much disruption or interference is being created and the size of any safety zone the officer can reasonably demand.
 
I hope my answer has been helpful.  Please let me know if you have any further questions on this matter.

I've been on Reddit for about four years and like the dialog that other officers' AMAs have opened up. Figured we could use some of that in r/Seattle.

I was so close with everyone who was injured, it's so hard to believe. I would have never expected this, the day before my graduation of 8th grade, a shooting at Cafe Racer, our favorite place to eat and enjoy ourselves. It seemed like such a peaceful place, a place that was so comforting and reliable, we went there anytime it was a special occasion and we knew everybody there. My parents even established an art show there, the walls were covered with bad art. Our close family friends were shot by a man named Ian Lee Stawicki who later shot himself in the head while surrounded by cops, he is alive and currently at the hospital. He went to Cafe Racer and shot five people many times. Two were immediately dead, two great guys who are in a great band, Drew, better known as Shmootzi, and Joe from God's Favorite Beefcake. They were both great men, I grew up listening to them and watching them preform, every time I saw drew we caught up and hugged. A third person died later in the hospital, she is unidentified, but we are worried it's drew's wife. Two others were wounded, one identified, and another man who is a chef named Leonard Meuse who was truly a great guy, he served us drinks every time we went to the cafe, he was shot three times, once in the jaw, and twice under the arm, they are both in critical condition. Ian, the shooter is suspected to be the same person who later shot a woman while hijacking an SUV on First Hill. I think it's sickening, I couldn't even imagine why someone would do this, to kill someone, without motive, even with motive, life is the most precious thing anywhere. Our family is afraid that the peace of Cafe Racer is destroyed, that we may never be able to enjoy Cafe Racer again, it would be too hard with the memories. We are afraid it may be shut down, and we have put so much into the cafe and all the people there. This week is a crazy, unbearable week, I am leaving St. Joseph's, my school of 11 years, I will never forget my time there, tomorrow is my graduation and last day. This has been a day of ups and downs, truly. I can't type any more.

I like beer and a bit of red wine, both of which you have to deal with bullshit to buy where I grew up, so I knew it was the right thing to vote to end liquor stores, even though at the end of the day I give no fucks about liquor.

Now, I realize the majority of you give not that many fucks about pot, and that's okay, but in the spirit of doing the right thing, will you please make an effort to vote yes on I-502.

If it passes, which it is currently polling at about 50/50 last I heard -- and that is not a good sign for an issue that a relatively small percentage of people actually feel strongly about -- it will be a giant troll move in the face of the federal government, and it will immediately go to the Supreme Court, because even though the 10th amendment is around (is that the right one? Sorry, I'm smoking weed), I think the whole situation is so entrenched that I'm more interested in the legal war that will erupt if it passes than being able to buy shitty weed at Safeway.

Anyway, **TL;DR**: I don't drink liquor, voted to end liquor stores anyway, and some of you seem very happy about that today, so please throw the potheads a vote for I-504 this Nov.

PS: Gays, come on, work with me here, you know I'm voting yes on getting gay married. That is a no-brainer. Help the stupid stoner in your life out too.

Thank you /r/Seattle and enjoy your booze.

We met up at 9:30am-ish outside of Uptown Espresso and headed to The Bicycle Pull-Apart to meet up with Eric. Eric however was not at the shop yet so the two of us headed to 5 points where we sat on some benches and talked for three or four hours. In that time people inside of The Five Points Cafe would come out and join us. We would strike up conversations ranging from Freemasonry being creepy as hell to the sexual fetishes of a certain policewoman. 

In the afternoon we parted ways, the two of us heading back to the shop where I was introduced to a variety of characters as well as Eric, the owner of BPA. We talked about bike options and for price within my budget I rode away on a very nice, very comfortable bicycle that I feel secure on. 

The best part is that it wasn't just business, it was community and I'm glad to be a part of it. You should be too. 

So thank you to Loquacious for all of his help, and thank you to bpaseattle.com for being so fucking rad. ",,False,self,t5_2qhad,False,,,True,t3_suner,http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/suner/this_is_why_seattle_is_so_popular/,

Once you knew a guy who sold you purple haze for $20/eighth and it was amazing. But if you're like me, you also paid $40-$60 for other stuff which dealers would often claim was pineapple express or jack herrer or whatever. Sometimes it was, sometimes it became clear that actually they just had a good sense of marketing and knew you'd pay more for 'AK47' than you'd pay for 'some green marijuana with decent trichromes and orange hairs.' If the legal weed market ends up anything like the medical market, you'll have places with lab-certified strains that you can reliably say 'This is X strain. It'll make me bounce off the walls and laugh and stay up. This other one is Y strain. It'll make my back stop hurting and I'll be asleep in an hour.' That right there is fucking awesome.


The real nail in the coffin lid for me: I'm willing to pay slightly higher prices for never having to listen to someone's shitty playlists, never have to sit there while my guy plays videogames for an hour before finally weighing some shit out, never having to go to some random location at a specified hour only to be kept waiting for an ungodly amount of time, never having to keep track of an ever-changing cell phone number for my guy because they use disposable phones, and never having to stand around talking to a dealer for an hour and a half because they're confused about whether I'm a customer or a buddy, even though the prices they're giving me clearly put me in the customer category. For not having to deal with all that bullshit, I will happily buy a $40 or even $48 eighth instead of a $30 or $35. 


We just did something amazing, and we don't know yet exactly what the effects are going to look like. Stop the kvetching, smoke a bowl of that shit which you can now own without fear of losing your student loans or having a criminal record or paying a fine. If you're stingy, I'm sure there'll still be a black market for you to buy from, but for fuck's sake, at least appreciate the awesomeness of what happened to us all last week.

1364400828.0,229,self.Seattle,1b47ix,Seattle do you recognize this car? They side-swiped me this morning and took off!,NiftyPistols,316,87,252,http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1b47ix/seattle_do_you_recognize_this_car_they_sideswiped/,"This morning the person driving [this car](http://i.imgur.com/mdF4wkh.jpg) had a vendetta against me!

The only reason I can think is that I honked at them when them cut me off (nearly running into me a first time) as I-5 merged with 520 (heading east towards Kirkland/Bellevue). They flipped me off, I flipped them off, such is the usual back and forth of the morning traffic.

I started to change lanes from the right to the left, he instantly changed lanes in front of me, so I just stayed where I was and *backed off*, I was not trying to pass this person, I honestly did not want to be anywhere near them. They were driving too erratically. But then my lane proceeded to go faster than his. I waited. I shit you not I waited, I waited for him to change lanes before passing him because I knew that he, for whatever reason, did not want me in front of him, therefore I did not want to be in front of him. But he stayed, the other lane nearly came to a stop, so I started to pass, as I did he shot out in front of me, nearly side-swiping me, again, and then slammed on his brakes! I had to hit the brakes so hard I swerved a little, but did not hit him.

So I backed off. I had several car lengths between he and I. I am not going to lie I really did not want to be anywhere near him.

The lane to my left started to slow down again. I thought 'Just my chance, I can get into the slow lane, several cars can pass on my right and I can get back over and be done with this fellow'.

Nope. The left lane started moving again. Well, he was behind a bus, so it wasn't moving quickly. I figure, I can get past the bus, get back in the right lane and be done with this fellow.

NOPE again! I should have known better. But oh well, such is life.

He straight up just changed lanes right into me as if I wasn't even there. Then shot out in front of me, changed over the right lane, which had started moving faster again and took off into the sunset. But not without allowing me to time to snap [this pic](http://i.imgur.com/mdF4wkh.jpg) (that I had the presence of mind to do so boggles me still).

I called the state trooper and gave them a description of the vehicle, that it had no plates, and the best description of the driver I could come up with. (Short black hair, I believe male).

So it is a red Subaru hatchback of some sort with black rack on top, there is (or at least there was) a handy cap tag hanging from the rearview mirror. There is likely damage to the front/side driver-side of the car.

I am still shaken up. I never would have thought that someone would throw themselves into someone else. Driving is not a game. It is not about winning and losing. We are all just trying to get somewhere.

**edit** I guess I did not make it clear, the Subaru did connect with my car on that last lane change. They did cause damage. They then took off. They were stuck to me like glue up until purposefully hitting my car.



**Update** 

Thanks for your comments and suggestions, and to many of you that have actually helped me to be calm and to remember that I am ok. I am alive, unharmed, and this could have been a lot worse. 

The State Trooper was just here. He took pictures of the damage and has started a collision report for me and filed a hit &amp; run report and everything so that I can call my insurance company and get all of that sorted out. 

He said that the chances are slim of catching this guy, and even if we did catch him you have to be sure that he was the one driving, it will likely be a he said vs she said kind of thing etc. so it is hard, he wanted to make sure that I knew that, especially since my description of the guy was vague, as I didn't get as good a look at him as I would have liked. But that he would still put the description out there and he would keep his eyes/ears open and would keep me posted on any developments.

He did say that this guy might try and call to file his own report for his own insurance and that would be the most likely way to find him.

But, I do have insurance. I am alive, I am calm, I am way behind on my work and feel like I have had several double espressos, but in good health none the less.

If, by some chance, anymore updates are warranted I will definitely post them here. I will also continue responding to questions and comments as they come in.

Thanks again!

**edit**  also someone has proceeded to downvote every single one of my comments, perhaps the Subaru driver in question is a Redditor? Or someone just really doesn't believe my story.

I was in the group marching at mid day.  There were maybe 200 people total and we accomplished what I thought was the surface level goal- we blocked traffic, we 'owned' the streets, and the police were happy enough to let everyone chant and march.  Then, as we turned up Seneca (I think) street I saw 'protesters', dressed in black, smash the windows of a Bank of America.  Next it was Wells Fargo, then another building, then Nike Town and American Apparel; the violence even engulfed cars, trashcans and signs in the vicinity.  Tear gas was dropped by police prior to Nike Town/American Apparel getting smashed and graffiti-ed, but it wasn't until those business were hit that the police started running at the crowd, quickly dispersing us into fragmented groups.

What I want to emphasize here is that the 'protesters' dressed in all black were a group within the group.  I know because I was walking next to them and was able to hear them coordinating with each other as they addressed each other by name.  They wore black pants, black shoes, black tops, black hats, black face masks, black goggles/glasses, which made them indistinguishable from one another, and while they were walking amongst the May Day protesters, they never intended to be a part of them.
They were there for the violence, clearly demonstrated by the black flags they held attached to thick, 1.5"" diameter dowel rods at nearly 4' in length- these, among other things, were what were used to cause the damage to businesses.

So thanks, assholes, for giving the message behind the entire protest a black eye and proving once again to the world that Seattlites are incapable of acting calmly when in a large group.  It's you that the MSM will cover, it's you that will be the gruesome face of this day, and it's because of you that the ignorant and the still uninformed will take that much longer to become active and aware, because they won't want to side with violent groups seemingly determined just to fuck things up.",,False,self,t5_2qhad,True,,,True,t3_t2c4u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/t2c4u/the_protest_riot/,

Cyclists: Whether you ride year round or just during the summer, please be careful. Remember to yield to cars, use your hand signals, and err on the side of caution, and be smart. When riding on the road, you must follow the same laws as cars do: especially stop signs and red lights!

Drivers: please pay extra attention. Some people riding tomorrow might a bit rusty. We always try to make ourselves seen to you, but sometimes we slip up. Triple check when making a turn over a bike lane, and remember to use your blinkers. If you have to pass a cyclist, please give them at least three feet of space; don't speed up behind them and then merge into another lane: the extra space is appreciated.

See you out there,

A good friend of mine is close with the moderator careless. This is how I found out. He said careless uses his botnet sometimes (not always) to upvote the things he likes so they make it near the top of the /r/Seattle frontpage, and he'll downvote things to knock them off the frontpage.

Unfortunately, it is very likely that enough signatures will be gathered, and Referendum 74 (and proably I-1192 as well) will end up on the ballot.  This is the tricky part though; because of the way the Referendum is worded, **proponents of gay marriage must vote YES on R74.**

In Addition:

I-1192 is not worded in that way, so **proponents of gay marriage must vote NO on I-1192.**

TL;DR

**If you support gay marriage:**

**Don’t sign Referendum 74 or Initiative 1192**

**But VOTE YES on Referendum 74**

**And VOTE NO on Initiative 1192**

This morning, I came upon two women running next to each other in the Ravenna bike lane. They were running with traffic and didn't see me coming up on them, which is why they were so startled when I passed them and shouted ""BIKE LANE!"" In turn, one of them instructed me to perform an anatomically impossible act. I understand the motivation for this response -- I was kind of being a jerk. That said, people really should not be running in bike lanes, particularly when they can't see whether they are blocking traffic.

And I get it. Really. The sidewalks are uneven. The roads are smooth. Cars (generally) stay well away from bike lanes, particularly the ones in Ravenna on the left side of the street. The bike lanes are inviting, particularly in the morning when nobody is outside. If you really must use a bike lane to run in, though, please run against traffic -- just like you're supposed to when you run on any street -- so that you can see oncoming bikers and get out of the way. Please tell your friends to do the same.

Oh, and in the interest of avoiding some sort of tribal battle, yes, there are cyclists who are idiots. They run red lights, they blow past pedestrians on the sidewalk, they almost run over kids on the Burke-Gilman trail because they're too busy checking their Strava.

Sadly one of my dear friends has gone missing since 7/14/12 at 4pm. Her name is Meagan, and she's Caucasian, has a pale complexion with brown eyes, and just turned 20. She is about 5 feet 4 inches tall, pink/purple hair past her shoulders (I have no recent pictures of her current hair), she was wearing a white see through dress and a white shirt underneath, knee high socks, along with colorful accessories in her hair. She was last seen on 8th and Spring, her shoes were found on the sidewalk so she should be barefoot. She looks younger for her age as well, I'll post a link to a picture below. She left her cell phone at home, no friends have seen or heard from her. Hospitals/police have already been called, no luck there.

Any tips on how to find her would be welcome as well.
PM me with any details you may have of her whereabouts, if you have seen her, or have any information.
Thank you.

Pictures of her below:
Edited out.

**edit**: A missing persons report has already been filed.

Her family are going to call the medical examiner in a few short minutes. Waiting for any updates.

**9:00pm**;; Still no word.

**UPDATE** The body was confirmed. 
Rest in Peace Meagan Bly.

Thank you everyone for sharing the posts and spreading around her picture.
Sorry for the grammar errors in advanced.


**Edit 2:** Thanks for all the words guys.
I'd rather not explain her death over this post just in case any other friends wander across this thread.
I don't want anyone else finding out her death like I had to do. Thank you in advance for the words of comfort. ",,False,self,t5_2qhad,1342453504.0,,,True,t3_wm6aq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/wm6aq/missing_friend_in_seattle_last_seen_71412_at_4pm/,

1361479703.0,184,self.Seattle,18z55d,"A couple nights ago I got my phone stolen by some guy while on the 522. This morning, he uploaded a picture of himself to my Facebook. Can any of you great people help me identify him?",Romo1794,209,25,181,http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/18z55d/a_couple_nights_ago_i_got_my_phone_stolen_by_some/,"Story time!

I was on the last 522 en route to Woodinville after a concert at Showbox.
By the time the bus gets to the 61st and NE Bothell Way stop, I see this guy reach down and swipe my phone from my hand. I run out after him, chase him down 181st Street, but ultimately lost him. 

I've reported this to the authorities, but without some kind of phone tracking app, there is almost no way they could actually find him.


So, accepting the fact that my phone is a lost cause, I woke up this morning to see that the guy had uploaded a picture of himself to my Facebook.

 I realized that he probably hasn't logged me out of my apps, since the picture went to my ""iOS Photos"" album, which I only upload pictures there when I'm using the Photo app on my iPhone.

**ANYWAYS TL;DR** [Here is his face](http://i.imgur.com/9WMbLSI.jpg). I'm hoping someone on this Subreddit can help me identify him. Thank you all for reading, wish me luck!

EDIT: Sorry mods, here is the incident number for the crime - **13-039040**
as well as the phone number for the kenmore precinct where I reported the crime - (206) 296-3311

~~EDIT #2: So I was diddling around my Facebook, when I found the Activity Log with all this information. Can anyone make anything out of the IP address?~~

EDIT #3: I got the call from the Officer that I filed the police report with, emailed him the pictures, and pretty much all the information I had on the guy. He said he was going to take a couple days before he figured out who the punk was, but I'd like to thank you all wonderful people for helping me out! Yesterday I thought getting my phone back was a lost cause, but today I feel like I might get it back. I'm not keeping my hopes up, *but I totally am.*

EDIT #4: Hehe, *""lost cause.""*

EDIT #5: I removed the Activity Log picture at the request of the mods, just because I don't want anyone trying to take vigilante actions against this guy. The cops should be able to sort him out sooner or later anyways. Thanks to everyone that's been trying to help me out with this though!

EDIT #6: Whoa so I'm totally a celebrity now -- except not. I was featured on Komo and Q13, so that was cool, at least this incident brought me my fifteen seconds of fame. Anyways, I'm updating this with some new information. According to a guy who added me on Facebook, he said that the kid is 16/17, hangs out at a local public library, and his first name is Damion. I sent this information to the police, but I haven't heard back yet. I'm hoping they can finally identify him though.

**EDIT:** So after reading the Anarchists thread it seems they have no interest in self-policing and are trying to brush off any accountability for vandalism. It's obvious that it's encouraged. Another post essentially said *any business owner* is a ""capitalist"" so they are a legitimate target. It's ridiculous. 

**To the Anarchists**
If you really hate these corporations, why don't you actively work at taking their business away? There are so many methods to hurt them in *real* ways. At this point, all you are hurting is the working class that you claim to stand up for. Your message is completely lost when people see destruction because as a group *you have control* over it. Seeing this type of behavior doesn't help anyone, not your cause, not the working class, *nobody*. **We love our fucking city** and you treated it like shit just for the sake of being destructive and your love of chaos. Now, I fully support your right to PEACEFULLY protest and that means not taunting the cops for an excuse to start vandalizing. If you don't want to be associated with chaos then make an effort to stop it before it gets out of hand. Then maybe people will start listening to you.


**Next year, we will make sure every vandal will be held accountable for their actions.**

BYOB and BYOM (meat.) Or bring lots of beer and trade it for meat. Or vice versa.

We need some people to sign up for BBQs so we don't end up with tons of hungry redditors and no BBQs, so please do so in the comments. Some people bringing wood for a fire would also be most welcome.

Brings games and whatnot! I might bring a speakers + portable amp so we can squabble over what music to play.

**Time:** I'd say target food being cooked and ready for consumption around noonish, so plan accordingly for set up. 

Lets make this one to remember, we can put r/Seattle on the map with this one!

*Disclaimer.* I took initiative on this one and created the thread, too often to meetups get discussed and then nothing comes of them. If you have any suggestions/things I should edit in add it in the comments!

Facebook event: http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=174505849271885

**EDIT:**

This blew up! Thanks guys! There's been talk of a lot of things such as reserving a shelter or even the bathhouse. I've got finals coming up so I can't effectively coordinate such an event, but if anyone else is willing to either straight up pay for reservations or coordinate the reservation please let me know! This is looking to be the biggest meetup yet, and with the social lubricant that is alcohol and dozens of people even the most socially awkward should have a stonking great time.

**EDIT 2**

Picture time at 2PM, as suggested by PapaTua. Bring your cameras and wide angle lenses!

**EDIT 3**

Tables 20 and 21 are OURS for the whole day! Thank you The_User_Abides, someone buy that man a month of gold. Keep your eyes out for the orange balloons!

Sad news. The wedding is off. I am not sure of the specifics, but as of now, there will no longer be a wedding on the 15th. 
I want to thank everyone for the tremendous support displayed. I was amazed and overwhelmed by the response of this community and am sorry we won't all be able to share this event together.
