I think it's pretty sad to see. I love smite and I have bought gems and the god pack. I've played it for quite a long time and have been 30 for ages.

I still don't want hirez to monitor my programs and what I do, while I'm NOT in any of their games. There have even been reports of bans handed out for ""cheating"" while no hirez games were running. it's a pretty serious violation of privacy and I hope hirez responds.

Bettering the community can be done in one, very simple step:  **Report the people who act like jerks.**

Some calls you a fag?  Mute them, report after the game.  Someone tells you that you're garbage?  Mute them, report after the game.  Someone says ""get raped loser,"" after they beat you?  **Block them and report.**

If you're having a bad day and you play badly, say that you're sorry, try to tower hug and support, and do your best.  But it's never your responsibility to be the victim of someone else's shit because they're cranky about a loss.

Now, if you're having a bad day and you start flipping out on someone, then you have no reason to be around the company of others.  Like in court when people say they had a bad day and went off and beat the hell out of someone.  You still go to jail.

These reports work, trust me.  HiRez is reading these logs, and taking appropriate action based on each case.  I know people who have been banned for years because of disgusting behavior.

Don't pass it off, don't let it slide.  If someone is acting in a way that makes you uncomfortable, it is your responsibility to make sure said player is punished.  Most players who face one or two day bans are unlikely to continue acting in such a way.  

Keep in mind:  Going 0/15 isn't intentional feeding all the time.  In fact, most of the time it's just someone having a bad game.  It's gonna happen.  I went 0/8 last night.  Sev went 3/16 a few days ago.  Shit, top players go negative ALL THE TIME.  You can not win every game.

If someone on your team isn't doing well, tell them what you need from them.  If you're up and they're down, tell them to tower hug and you'll try and rotate.  If they keep pushing, tell them to be patient.

It's up to all of us to make sure the rotten eggs are separated from the bunch, and to encourage people to behave in a way that makes the game more fun for everyone.",MISC,False,,t5_2stl8,False,fluff,arachne,True,t3_1ki5oi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1ki5oi/psa_the_report_button_is_not_a_feature_it_is_a/,

*Hello everyone, I am CtrlAltDefeated, and for if you haven't seen me around, I recently joined the mod team on this Subreddit. In cooperation with the other staff on this Subreddit, we've laid out plans for the near future, so here they are. 't would be awesome if you could click the little arrow pointing upwards to the left, so we can make sure everyone on the Reddit sees this post. I'm not taking any karma for it anyways. Now, back on topic. We have news to discuss!*

As /r/Smite has started to grow more rapidly over the past few weeks, there has started to be a need for certain changes on the subreddit. This is mostly to clean up the slightly chaotic setup and to create more usable structure. This wasn’t really a problem a few months ago, but because of the recent growth and popularity of /r/Smite (100k+ unique hits in April), we have to change certain elements. A brief list of what is going to happen over the coming weeks:

* Rules and Protocol: the main point. There will be a much more detailed rule system coming up, and there will also be a succinct version of it displayed on the sidebar, with a link to the full protocol and rules list. In the new rules section, we are going to try to cover up all grey areas in between what is allowed and what is not. We will not be inhibiting your current constructive posting habits however.

* FAQ: a Frequently Asked Questions section will be made, containing a lot of questions (and answers!) regarding mostly the subreddit itself. It is not 100% definitive, many of the answers might already be included in the new rule and protocol section. Posts that can be answered via the FAQ will be removed in the future citing a link to the FAQ.

* New Subreddit layout: getting rid of the outdated theme that is currently in use. 

Other Sidebar improvements, such as

* Improved Match of the Day information. Not just the official description, but straight-to-the-point facts about the match.

* Links to Patch Notes threads, and the Official discussion threads, which are explained right below this.
Condensing the sidebar and using the wiki to help clean it up. (ex: There will be a “Community Fansites” link that goes to the wiki and lists all the fansites. It helps condense the sidebar and keep it clean).

* “Official” discussion threads: Threads made by moderators and used as the official place to discuss new gods, features, items, and gamemodes. Will be done mostly per patch, unless the patch is big enough to be split up in two or even three different threads. This will allow us to declutter the subreddit and allow HiRez one central place to view feedback on Reddit.

* Wiki Improvements: In its current state, the wiki is far from complete, and we will be trying to at least provide basic information about each god and Gametype, and slowly work our way to adding links to guides and more extensive descriptions of each God and/or commonly used terms in Smite (e.g. CC, GF, etc.).
* Flair Cleanup: The way flair will be distributed is going to be changed.
- Free for all God flair (White, god faces) is still going to be available for everyone, like it currently is
- /r/Smite Moderator flair (green) is, obviously, reserved to staff members. 
- HiRez Studios flair (orange) will only be available for HiRez representatives and will not be accesible for normal member  (it used to be possible to actually use the flair logo, even though it had white text).
- Top Tier Gaming Team flair (White, team logos) will not be usable by normal memers anymore, as was previously possible. This flair can only be gotten upon mod mail request. If you are part of any of the teams and visit this subreddit regularly, please send us a mod mail. 

So, to clarify again, your normal god flairs will not be removed, altough it might be subject to change. We'll give everyone a heads up if there are any major changes. This is more aimed at the extra flairs that have caused some confusion and hurt feelings over the past few weeks, such as the gaming team flairs. 

If you have any feedback please feel free to leave it in this thread and we’ll read every post and take it into consideration as a moderator team. And if you would like to help with the Wiki or the FAQ, feel free to drop me a PM and be sure to add a link to your article (use Google Docs, Pastebin, etc. for pasting long bits of text, not the PM itself). Credit will be given.

The guys said I could make up some bull crap excuse and say I needed time away from the game or personal stuff or whatever but... I always keep it real. 
That's one of my biggest issues is how blunt and forward and bad manner I can be. I was raised that way and even if it's mean I say it. I can't do much about it, but I'm going to try to change that in my upcoming streams and what not.

People either love me or hate me and my greatest quality is my worst quality. It's funny how things work out like that sometimes.

This post is pretty much just a heads up dealio because I know how the SMITE community gets with drama and rumors.
They are still my boys for the most part. I will probably keep my distance because in all honesty I feel betrayed in a way, but it's a business to them and I respect it from a business perspective. 
A team to me is more then business, it's a bond, friendship and a brotherhood and some people don't see it that way and there is nothing wrong with that, it's just how things go.

I will still be around in the competitive scene and still stream on SMITEPRO and see where it takes me. I'm sorry for letting my team down and my fans and other competitive players in the scene. I can be a real douche sometimes. I just wear my feelings on my sleeve, whether its rage, happiness, bad manners or chicken.

It's a big reality check and I hope you guys stick with me through my bumpy road. I just brought so much real life stress into the game and it's not gonna happen again. 

Sorry I'm rambling and sorry for letting you guys down.

I would like to propose a change in the way supports receive ELO in the ranking system. The change I would like to have made would not only encourage players to want to play the support/tank role, it would also allow persons who play support to give the kills to the proper person; the carry (a win win situation).

The support player should receive ELO per assist and major objective HoGd (ie GF, FG). As of right now, the ELO system seems to be based off of two major things: 1) Kills 2) Farm. Both of these major things are something a support certainly does not get much of if they are doing their job properly (Supports should always have less kills/farm then their carries). A support is only noticed by how he helps his teammates, which is mainly seen in assists through good CC/positioning. HoGging objectives is another way that supports can really sway a game into their teams favor, which is why I feel it should also be rewarded. I personally have had several games where I've stolen FGs and GFs for my team and it's something that should be rewarded. Rewarding good habits is how a player learns, since they are more inclined to perform proper actions if rewarded accordingly for them. Suggested numbers for ELO gains would be 1 ELO per assist (or make it equal to a kill) and 3 ELO per major objective HoGd. *Assist and HoG benefits should only be given to Support/Tank specific Gods.

An example of how poorly the ELO system works right now for supports/tanks: https://account.hirezstudios.com/smitegame/match-details.aspx?match=14868505. A 57 minute game in which I HoGd many objectives and received 33 assists and yet only gained 11 ELO. SMH!

If there is anything that I would like Hirez to do for me it would be this. Please Hirez, show me that you care about the community and me and that you recognize support players existence!

*God Icon: http://i.imgur.com/85y3juY.jpg*

**Unknown [P]** - From icon looks to be some type of minion mechanic. (Icon: http://i.imgur.com/XLKqYOB.jpg)

**Scroll [1]** - Creates entity in the game world. Most likely Zhong Kui's hand and marks a select target for 4 seconds. (Icon: http://i.imgur.com/e3vejJN.jpg)

**Fierce Glare [2]** - Deployable in the world. Has a delayed heal attached to it and interacts directly with Bag of Demons. (Icon: http://i.imgur.com/OF7e7R7.jpg)

**Exorcism [3]** - Charged up damage ability with countdown mechanic on use. (Icon: http://i.imgur.com/NQANT14.png)

**Bag of Demons / Recall Demons [4]** - Interacts differently with friendly and enemy gods. Has a two step on use effect and can also interact differently with the marked target from Scroll. Has some type of stacking mechanic which may be linked to Fierce Glare. (Icon: http://i.imgur.com/zhnMjYq.jpg)


##Guan Yu V2

**Fortified Defense (?) [P]** - Passive gains stacks and acts as a healing multiplier (with a max cap on stacks) for Tranquil Gift.

**Tranquil Gift [1]** - Works similar to the live version. Hitting friendly gods with your heal will reduce your other cooldowns.

**Warrior's Will [2]** - Works similar to live except that it records how many enemy gods you hit and has a mechanic that plays off of the max number hit.

**Unknown [3]** - Taolu Assault is still missing from Guan Yu's kit. Instead his third ability in version 2 is titled ""TripleJumpSlam"" which leads me to believe a toned down version of his current ultimate will replace Taolu Assault as his new 3.

**Gallop [4]** - Rides a warhorse (we know this already). Ultimate will have 3 phases each ramping up with increased speeds (P1 - 1x, P2 - 1.5x, P3 - 900 movespeed). Will have a turning mechanic similar to Vamana's dash known as ""Lean Aim Mode"". Appears to max out the stacks on his passive when ultimate is used.


## New Gamemode / Map

There are several mentions of a new Capture and Hold (single control point) map in the game files. It is mostly prefixed with ""Norse_"". Instances of 10v10 Joust, 10v10 Arena, and 10v10 Domination have also been added to the game.

##VIP Status

The VIP status icon has been added to the new interface's files. It would be safe to assume since these are new files for the new UI and the VIP icon is present that it more than likely has an intended use in the near future.

##PVE and VS Modes

Loads of new icons appear in the new interface files. All of them are prefixed with ""PVE_"" or ""VS_"" and depict various images such as swords, crossed arms, and a few more.

##EDIT: Olympus Map Replacement for Conquest

Found a fair amount of new map assets for Olympus. All focusing around the current objectives for Conquest. Here's a gated entry way to the minotaur's arena: http://i.imgur.com/13mqTOK.jpg

##No Upcoming God

Jumong is the only unreleased god besides Zhong Kui to appear in the game files. Jumong has been in the game files for months now, so don't get your hopes up on this being the next next god. From browsing the files it looks like HiRez is focused on launching the new gamemode, reworking GuanYu, Hel, and Sun Wukong, granting graphical updates to nearly their entire lineup of gods, and restructuring most of the game for launch. From what I can piece together from the files I would expect a **MAJOR announcement at Gamescon** concerning the future of Smite and major changes.

*As always this information is subject to change. Just like always and it almost always happens.*

It's not just viable, it's so mandatory its sickening. If a team doesn't have a jungler and the enemy team does? Auto loss. The solo lane will simply get more exp than the duo lane and should they push him to his/her tower, they risk getting ganked by the jungler. So they shouldn't push? So much for making this game less passive. Not having a jungler leads to free reign to roam the entire map with Fog of War for the enemy side. The lanes are much shorter and if you back, you risk losing a tower very quickly on account of that. The jungle itself has so many invisible walls it's difficult to chase a jungler as well, who already has a trumendous advantage over side laners. I honestly hate Bumba's Mask and the jungling more than the Tank meta and even Focus. Yeah I said it. So far, I had a whopping ONE Conquest game where both teams had no jungler. It was the most fun match I've had since Bumba's was introduced. I don't understand why they're trying to hard to enforce jungling into this game. I'm running out of things to say at this point without needless rambling, perhaps I already have, but I'm sure people understand what I mean. Whenever I'm about to queue for Conquest, I  ask myself.

– Listen to audiobooks. While they are expensive to buy and lengthy to illegally download, I've found that my local library has many available on CD. Switching out disks after dying to a gank is easy to do while I ponder what will happen next in Game of Thrones.

– Perform basic hygiene tasks. Do your nails need trimming? Forgot to brush your teeth this morning? All of these things and more can be easily accomplished if you just play your lane extremely passively, as you should. Just remember to VVK before you go shave.

– Do sit-ups. Motivation for physical activity can easily be found from the hatred that taunt-spamming smurfs inspire. 

– Prepare food. Another way to cope with loss.

– Watch streams of people playing junglers. They look like they're having a good time.

This is going to be a **REALLY long post**, full of personal opinions, so be prepared to be annoyed.  

I've noticed recently, especially within the last week, that the amount of ""toxicity"" (bad manners) in SMITE has been on a steady increase. This includes sources such as reddit, streams, tournaments, players, etc.  

Now, this isn't a surprising turn of events; the more people you get into a community the more likely you are to have ""BM"" or ""toxic"" individuals. I'm sure everyone is at least aware of this. Drama is bound to come up in any scene, and **people are in no way obligated to like or support any sort of community member in SMITE**.   

I'm about to pull some BS that the inner teacher in me wants to shove in peoples faces...   

  *....if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.*  

Now of course there's stipulations to this, some ""negative"" comments are still constructive and helps build us as individuals. And of course, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But, I find it BEYOND baffling, that some people make a conscious decision to watch streamers/players they don't like, and in return, post a slew of slanderous comments. It is also astounding when people hear a comment about a player or a team, and immediately jump on the witch hunt band wagon. 

I'm sure many of you think this is a post only about myself (and I definitely do get hate) but I want to make it very clear that there is a very, very small portion of myself that cares about the negative comments I get. I'm a female gamer who has been streaming for over a year, negative comments are a dime a dozen. I do take the time to listen to those that are constructive, and try to better myself off of that.

I do however, get **INCREDIBLY ""butt hurt""** when I see amazing community leaders such as DMBrandon, Drybear, and the array of other streamers, players and teams, who put their all into this community, get trashed.

I'm aware that we can be annoying, trust me, I annoy myself far more than I should, but are you really doing the community any good by being hateful? 

I don't mind trolls, those are people that are simply bored with their own lives and do it to any community they see fit at the time. However, I do **cringe** at other members of the same community, reaching for what I believe to be the same goal, attacking each other.

My opinion is in no way the correct one, this is simply how I feel and I am aware and prepared for the people who have differing opinions of my own.

So I suppose what this all comes down to is...

**I want to hear YOUR opinions on the subject and how you think its affecting the community**  

This is in no way going to change how anything is run or operated, I am simply genuinely interested to see how other people feel about the subject.

Sorry for the long post, I seem to ramble even when I'm typing. And to the people that don't like the way I carry myself or my stream, I send an open invitation to e-mail me at klink@hirezstudios.com to discuss ways that I can represent the community better.

A temporary solution improved the situation greatly yesterday, but what we hope is a final solution for the issue was put in place with a server restart this morning, Saturday August 10.

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the data loss, we cannot accurately recreate everything needed to properly give back all rewards.

I will attempt to convey it to everyone who could not make it for any one of the many valid reasons -- whether it was a financial constraint or geographical or anything in between. I truly hope this little post explains the **one thing** that is standing out to me thus far at this unique exposition set in the epicenter of pop culture for Texas.
&gt;

I do not presume to know why you like SMITE as much as or more than any other game on the market. I can guess that it might be the notable perspective difference for an ever-expanding game genre. It could be the observance of various mythologies that expands with every update to the character roster. Or maybe it is the social aspect of gaming with friends and participating in live streams. No matter what your reason for enjoying Smite, there is **one thing** that keeps coming up here at RTX that I cannot sleep tonight without sharing with you.

&gt;

What is the **one thing**? Have I lost you yet? I sincerely hope you have stuck with me to this point. It is imperative that you grasp the point of this post, so please read on. The **one thing** is expectation. Players and content creators we are meeting are not wishing that Smite will succeed. They *expect* it to succeed.

&gt;

From new players creating an account at the booth to people with eFame that makes Bart cry himself to sleep, people I talk to keep giving me the impression that they want to hitch a ride on the Smite train to see exactly where it is going. And they cannot contain their obvious and overwhelming expectation for Smite to succeed.

&gt;

Although [The Creatures](https://www.youtube.com/user/thecreaturehub) experienced a new level of stardom with the success of their first ever panel discussion, they came to cheer us on at the booth as well as the [after-party tonight](http://instagram.com/p/baXPPStIZ4/). Why would a group of young, ambitious dudes who keep gaining notoriety by the second among their peers be hanging with a skeleton crew from an independent game developer from the southeast? Is it because [Bart is such a great man-kisser?](https://twitter.com/Mamasp00n/status/353377224059146240) According to some brief words I have had with SlyFoxHound, it is because they not only want to see us grow, they *expect* us to grow.

&gt;

And then there is the legendary [SirScoots](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=236041). While he may not have gotten in line for [Bart's kissing booth](http://imgur.com/a/C2TrG) just yet, [he's staying in the firing line](https://twitter.com/SirScoots/status/353326290922766337). Tonight, he made sure that plenty of us knew he saw the potential of Smite. I got the impression he was looking to help the Smite eSports community move forward in a serious way. Bart can fill in more of those details of course.

&gt;

My point is not to name drop and image bomb in this post. I just want you all to realize that people are noticing this game that you enjoy. They sincerely identify with many of the same reasons you enjoy it. And they genuinely expect it to grow and succeed. Keep that in mind the next time someone asks you, ""Hey, what game are you playing right now?"" Be proud to answer, ""I play SMITE. And you know what? You should too!""

I think most of the people here are either people that cannot make it due to time problems or lacking in a team into the competetive scene so they try to make it worse than it actualy is.


And people that just dislike the competetive scene or the game for whatever reason.... because when you count 1+1 together that we have already a EU scene with about 22 teams that want to play there every week in a game that is fairly unknown to anyone still is a good thing.


People always expect too much because they have a standart from LoL or DOTA but this is not the case in SMITE.. SMITE is completely different not jsut that its 3rd person and hard to spectate also like people said ""PRO"" players are not innovative enough with lets say the 2-1-2 lane setup.... believe me we try to find the best META at any given time and right now it is the 2-1-2 .. jsut as an example!


Also the competition in EU is very tight SK/ViCs/BLGEU/and elemon now with badgah and youngbae playing there anyone of these called teams have the same chances to win this tournament ( i don't want to say that other teams don't but this is how i se it right now)

Also yes CW disbanded and i'am really sad about that but this is how it goes and if they lost the joy to play the game that's jsut how it will come down....


Also to pick on hirez a bit now yess i know that people saying stuff doesn't get paid out but as it goes for me and my Team we never had any problems whatsoever with getting paid out i don't know if this was a one time thingy or whatsoever but as for us we never had any problems with that!


Next up people complaining about ""PRO"" players don't play smite that much... that has probably something to do with the players itself not soo much the game (also the game a bit ) because for my part iam playing and streaming the game about 10 hours every day to get better and better and i know for myself that i'm far away from being at my own best that i could be mechanically or overall mobawise so i will play and practice till i reach this goal for me and my TEAM!



On the other hand the NA scene they also have SNIPE/ROOT/CURSE right now that are top the only thing is that ROOT just shines out right now because they really have every driving memeber from the older teams (RG/CURSE) so obviously the other teams get weaker if the core member is leaving and root will get stronger probably!


And all the whining about the scene is bad or the community is not there where you guys want it to be because of this and that but that is not the case because of this and that .... that is the case because of us all !
You guys want to the scene to be good and friendly and fair but yet still you pick and post and whine about every small misstep someone makes or has done in the past... and yet still people complain and complain and don't do anything about it to change it!

GUYS it is up to us the community to make this a better place not anyone else so if everyone of you guys just ask yourself what they want for this community and do whatever they can do make it happen it will get a better place sooner or later... but always complaining and hoping someone else will fix it won't fix anything...


I have to say and admit yes the scene is from time to time bad with admins doing stupid stuff or whatever there is but you have to say that everyone even the casters are new to the whole thing more or less so it is still a learning experience for both the players and the community casters admins ect to behave the right way and to do stuff the right way... hell even for hirez they need to see what they can do when they can do it and how it works out...



So after everything being said what i have to say hopefuly i haven't offended anyone i just said what i had to say after all the drama (which is not that much people tend to make it more than it actualy is) happening!

(ALSO MY GRAMMER and my wall of text is op don't blame me i just write down everything i have to say i don't wanna sell it as a book!)

Every time you kill an enemy they are worth 80% less gold until they get a kill for themselves, when it resets back to 300.

If they enemy gets more than one kill without a death, they are worth 300 + 10% gold for each kill in the killstreak.

Thats all fine and dandy, but 90% of these things are scams, hell all the game downloads are keyloggers. And no, this wasnt a phishing attempt by some people, this is legit. However, the sites, and the things on them, are not. So if you're too cheap to spend money on the game, and would rather get all sorts of shit on your computer feel free.

What I'm asking for isn't anything incredibly difficult as other MOBAs (I'm looking at you DotA 2) have executed most of this before.
 A lot of the things that I'm bringing up have also been complained about before, I'm just trying to make a collaboration.
Please feel free to comment with your opinions on this and what else needs to be added to this list.

* The toxic community in both casual and ranked matchmaking.

I know you're thinking that this can't be solved and I agree with you on that, but it can be improved. DotA 2 has this system that allows you to either report or commend people, in addition to just straight out blocking them. This way you can not only discourage people from being jerks, but encourage them to be nice. The report system has been largely the same since the launch of the Smite Beta and, let's be honest here, do any of us really see it to be working well in its current state? We still get toxic players in almost every match we play. Something really needs to change whether it's more severe and accurate reporting, telling us when a player we reported has action taken upon them (like in DotA 2), the implementation of a commendation system, or something similar.

* Matchmaking.

Casual: ""dn't wnt 2 play wit us bad plyers go play rnked""
Ranked: ""OMG YOU PICKED HERCULES INSTEAD OF THOR REPORTED UNINSTALL""
Yeah, something really needs to change here. I totally get that Casual is more casual than ranked, thus the name, but these are two extremes right now. I would like a shot at winning without everybody insta-locking assassins and then not talking until they die from an uncalled missing, but I would also like to play some Gods that aren't in the Ranked Meta without being flamed for it. Games should be fun and Smite is when you get two balanced teams, but that virtually never happens. I constantly get matched up with level 18 players just learning not to buy Meditation on every God flaming everybody else for their mistakes. I'm not going to go into what needs to be changed with Ranked because I sort of have already. With a better report system, we'll see less people going in and flaming and/or trolling. The ""Trueskill"" system obviously isn't working at the moment, and I (and most people) would totally be fine with increased queue times if it meant we got  more balanced match. Hell, I'd even settle for something that isn't a timed queue even though I have a strong sexual attraction to them.

* God Balance.

Everybody knows about this one. Power creep has become a huge part of Smite. While this isn't terrible, I actually sort of prefer Gods with crazy kits because I think it adds a higher skill ceiling, the older Gods really need to have something happen to them. You might argue that certain Gods will always be better than others, and I do agree with this to an extent, but all or at least most Gods should have their place with counter picking or situational picks. In DotA 2 (Yes, I'm going to compare this game to DotA 2 a lot, get used to it. It's a fantastic game.) Heroes hop in and out of the meta, but it doesn't really have that much to do with balance patches. It only takes someone picking them up and doing well with them for others to follow along behind them, so the meta is changing very often, even if IO and Batrider and almost always first paick/ban. The point I'm trying to make is, we need to have a ton of God variation in this game and those Gods actually having a chance at an equal bracket against the other Gods.

* Item quantity and balance.

Currently in Smite, there's pretty much some divine best builds. These builds and items are generally accepted as the best and simple math can prove that they are, indeed, the best. In DotA 2, this isn't the case. Literally all items on all Heroes are situational, there aren't any items that simple calculations can refute as being worse than others, there's an incredibly high amount of variation. In Smite, we have around 5 items for each purpose with some passive abilities that benefit the user, but generally there's one that's just better than all of the others. We're never like ""Oh, they have Anubis as their main mage, let's get this magical defense item or attack item instead of this one"". It just doesn't happen when it probably should. We need more situational items and general item balance.

* Region Locking.

I was going to put this under matchmaking, but I feel like this is so big that it needs its own point. We need the ability to choose a region, not just a preferred one, and lock it in. With a game that requires so much precision to succeed, I can't believe that we don't have this anymore. I've gotten matched up with either EU players on my team or on the enemy team, and either them or I are getting the short end of the stick with the latency issue. 200 ping vs 50 ping makes an incredibly large difference as you all know and a game can be lost right from the start if you're playing someone that requires precision and you have terrible ping.

* Random weird small issues.

There are too many to really record and write down, but that's the point of this. A lot of really small things that collectively make a big difference need to be changed. We have these weird little inconsistencies and quirks that shouldn't be in a professional and serious game. I'll give you guys a couple examples so you see what I mean:
No ability to sell back actives after a misclick, at all. I think we at least need a 10 second rule for those, or the ability to sell them back within something like 5 minutes if we haven't used it yet. 
Various UI glitches and overall a very underwhelming system. I feel like HP5 should either mean health every 5 seconds all at once or just constantly being shown refreshing every .1 seconds or so.
I'm sure you guys can think of more of these little things. They aren't a big deal, but the game would feel a lot more polished and well-thought-out if this was the case.

* ~~Private~~ Public Test Servers. 

We used to have this magical place where things were tested before release to avoid game breaking bugs and crazy unbalance. This place has vanished, so we just get broken stuff every once in a while (I'm looking at you, release Bumba's) and have to deal with it until we get a patch. I feel like we should get these servers back as it helps players have a more personal effect on the game's development and overall increase the balance and fun of the content in the actual game.
(Edit: Fixed point subtitle, wasn't thinking. Thanks, theskulls!)

* Disclaimer

These are just things off the top of my head. Like I said earlier, please comment with your opinions on what should be added to this list and I'll do my best to keep up with the additions. I don't want this to be a simple complaint thread and rather a guide of exactly shat the community wants now and in the future so that Hi-Rez can make the best game possible. You can post things here a year from now if you want and, if it's a good idea, I'll edit with the point.
I also want to make it clear that I'm not saying that I don't think these things won't be in the game, just that the game would be much better with the improvements.

I would also love it if you guys didn't just vote either up or down but also gave either a positive or negative comment based on your opinions. Thanks!

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; only the one you already have

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Ideally we have a few working meta's that counter each other, but it's hard to get to that balance

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; 2-1-2 can get very stale if it's the only meta

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; If you just want to sit and lane 2v2 we can probably make a game mode for that

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; all magic gods will move to magic in-hand

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; next patch should have a bunch of tier 3 item choices

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; freya will be all magic

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; then we can make in-hand items for magic

&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; Erez, any plans to address the ranged physical carry being typically the lowest minion gold earning role in the game?  As it stands, the support in their lane with midas will earn more gold than the carry, even if the carry last hits all the minions.  Couple that with the new item, and the carry falls even further behind.

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Will look over the ranged ad

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; going to test some major changes to domination

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; it will look very different then the current mode

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; We are betting everything on Smite :)   some big announcements coming at Gamescon

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; no smite MMO or anything weird

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Smite is not going to fail, it's already doing well and only growing.  Something only about 1% of games do

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; PTS does not give us enough feedback

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; PTS is only good for testing bugs, but we need a much larger user base to test features

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Elo will probably get reset in the next couple of weeks

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Probably a hard reset in ranked to see how it goes

&lt;xxxxxxxx&gt; everyone starts at 1k elo

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; 1500 is avg

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; support are fine with the elo rating, it's a K+A to death

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; DId you guys know that the frame for Level 10 mastery looks a bit different then normal gold frame?

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; The icons on the left also glow

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; They are for prestige

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; next patch is a lot of new tier 3 items

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; that's next week

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; week after that is another new god

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Hel remodel is moving forward, but it's a lot of work since it's more then a single model

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; blue beams is a nice idea

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; new model and some changes to her abilities

&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; Erez, i heard there will be a sort of hotfix regarding some kind of through the world thing, when is that?

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I think the hotfix is tonight

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; 70+ people working on Smite now

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Smite started with about 15-20 people

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; It was actually started as another GA game mode that I was designing before I knew there was something called a 'MOBA'

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; We had 2 bases, and NPC streaming while you tried to take the other base.   I was told to go play Dota/LoL since there was already a game mode like that

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Smite will be getting a lot more servers around the world over the next few months

&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; Erez any hints on who the next god will be?

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Support god

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I don't know where the servers will be based, Stew does that

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I don't really have a favorite god

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; One of the first games I made was for the Atari 2600

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Actually is was a 'kind' of lunar lander but not the original

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I wrote games in Assembly 6502 before going to college

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; My first program was on a punch cards computer, lol

&lt;xxxxxx&gt; Erez I liked neiths old bow better :(

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I have no idea why we changed her bow

&lt;xxxxxx&gt; Erez Will we ever be able to buy the skins like ra alienware and kali red one? I'll be super sad if I miss out on those

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; No idea if we will sell those skins, that's Todd department

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I really want to stay away from a pure single meta like LoL

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; when you get hit there is a red out line we are testing

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; RTS games have multiple meta

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; 2-1-2 was just getting too boring to play and watch

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; 2-1-2 should be a valid option

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; All magic Gods will move to magic in-hand soon and more items to support them

&lt;xxxxxx&gt; what language is smite written in and what DB are y'all using on the back end (curious because i'm a dev myself)

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Unreal 3 engine and C code

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; you will be able to play something like an AD ra but with magic damage

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; no crit for mages

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I think there will be a god with a jetpack at some point

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; as a skin

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I think we talked about a jetpack apollo

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Smite is really the only game we are focused on now

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; GA2 when we have time

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; We put a lot of work into Tribes but we can only take it so far.   99% of games decline in users (Including Tribes) but Smite is one of the few games to actually be growing (very rare)

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Voice chat is just another way to troll

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; There is not going to be all chat

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; There are a lot of voice chat options available already

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Domination is getting a big change

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; We are about to start testing it, it's going to be changed a lot in game play

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; The theme is staying the same, the map is very different

&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; Erez, what do you thing about a MOBA tower defense game mode for Smite with giant minions, etc.

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; We actually tried that a few months ago, kind of a PvE mode

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Next path will let you refresh the buff you have if you get the same one 

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; No drops of buff, you need to decide which one you want

&lt;@hirezkabir&gt; what Chronos 2 gllitch?

&lt;@hirezkabir&gt; Chronos accelerates over time then decelerates

&lt;@hirezkabir&gt; where gonna put in som ebetter feed back for that soon

&lt;@hirezkabir&gt; i'm 100% it works, it's not immediate like most buffs, but this is intentional

&lt;@hirezkabir&gt; not sure the exact timeat full

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; The jungle buff stacking makes one player happy and 4 players pissed

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; Smite always gets optimization changes, some work better then others

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; FG does not count as a jungle buff

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I don't really know the timing on skins and voice packs since I focus a lot more on the design

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; assault will get a new graphics pass after conquest is done

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I'm slightly above average elo unless I try really hard

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; I never cheat, it ruins any video game

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; The conquest map graphics are getting a huge overhaul

&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; do I need to write something in that field or blank is just enough to report a troll?

&lt;@hirezerez&gt; better if you write something

&lt;@hirezkabir&gt; we're looking into why some players are unable to load into new Joust

HiRezTodd:
Sun WuKong will be getting an entirely new treatment in a future update. 
He will have different abilities, a completely different graphical model, sounds, &amp; visual fx. 
Our goal, consistent with community feedback, is to make the new Sun WuKong more fierce in both presentation and abilities. But this new Sun WuKong is still many weeks away. 

At the same time we know some players enjoy the current monkey-god and playstyle. 
With the next release we will transform the current Sun WuKong into the Mayan monkey god Hun-Batz. Compared to current Sun WuKong, Hun-Batz will have a different look, different fx, but very similar abilities. And Shoalin Monkey skin will remain usable on new Hun-Batz.

Additional details to be provided on smitegame twitch stream starting next week.

As many of you will know, there are a handful of gods who could do a sustained jungle route and gank lanes, as seen in other popular moba's like League of Legends and DoTA. However, there has never been a full-time jungle role in Smite, despite many of these gods (Arachne) being available from the very beginning. The reason why jungling isn't viable has never been a case of bad gods or bad items; it's because of the jungle layout itself.

In current sidelane meta, the most important factor between success and failure is the timings that you and your lane partner have for clearing buff camps and minion waves in order to ensure the maximum amount of experience and gold possible. Because of this meta, side lanes are VERY quick at taking down their own sides buff camps meaning that against any competent lanes, you will not be able to take their camps without assistance.

In addition to this, as a full-time jungler, you would have to deny your own team from the experience, gold and buffs available to them from these said buff camps. If you factor in that the enemies of that lane will be taking their own buffs, you'll realise that you're actually causing one of your sidelanes to get behind their opponents due to your desire to jungle. The end result of this is that you have a one side lane that is behind their opponents due to lack of jungle creeps, another side lane that has been sitting under his tower in a best case scenario, getting zoned or feeding in a worst case scenario, and a jungler who, yes, has a lot of gold, but is still behind on experience because of the FACT that there is not enough experience available in the jungle to make up for the experience you're missing in lane.

So please, please, please don't be that guy who decides to call ""JUNGLE ARACHNE"" tomorrow; it's not viable, and you're just going to screw over your team.

So I had deserter on my main account because of a client crash, and I remembered I had a low lvl account, so I logged on that and joined conquest novice queue, where I met this guy, he politely asked if he could lane with me, I chose Zeus and he was on He Bo.

He played really well, despite being a completely new player, not making stupid mistakes, overextending etc. So I kept on complimenting him and he did the same with me, which was really nice! After the match he added me and told me Smite was his favourite game right now (because of that match) and that he actually really loved it, so he asked me how he could get favor fast, I told him he just needed to play conquest, but after two more matches where he had rented Agni, he said he couldn't wait to buy him with favor. Then I thought ""why wait?"" then I told him I was gonna get him a present, he didn't understand at first but when he saw he suddenly had 1500 gems, man was he in heaven he was so happy he barely could accept them! He asked if he could return them to me, but of course I told him no, it's his gems, so I really think I gave this guy a good introduction to Smite, because he already asked if we could play tommorow, so that he could practise Agni. So in the end I'm happy and he's happy, things can't get better. I really love the feeling of making someone happy, and this was just awesome!

Sure we fixed ddos issues in SK, but previously Denial suffered and now we suffer.

The reality of online gaming is DC's can and will happen, electrical power cuts, internet connectivity issues or even a family member unplugging the router. We need a pause feature to ensure the best team is winning and that matches are fair.

Today we played vs VenG, it was a very close and good game. Gold was level, everything was good. Ghortak dc'ed and instantly we have issues. Sure you can win 4on5 against some worse teams, but the reality is when you are playing a team like this you cannot simply win 4on5 in such a close game.

Every game I know has a pause feature, League, sc2, CS:GO for example. This can even happen at LAN events, if a players PC crashes etc.

Simply this feature seems to be on the back of Hirez's agenda and its actually critical for this game as an esport. When 8000+ people are watching the ESL stream and someone dc's and we cannot pause, the game will look extremely amateur.

Can we please get an ETA on pause feature, lets spend less time developing Shard/OP items and more time fixing the current things wrong with Smite!

2. A New UI, mostly visual

4. ALL Magic gods have magical basic attacks/inhands (including Tanks)

5. 2-3 new Gold Skins. ""One for a spider"" ""1 for someone small"" and ""2 ranged ads"", so with this *smokes Sherlock Pipe* one can deduce Arachne, Cupid, and then some Ranged AD without a Gold yet

6. Freya and Ymir passvies changed to Magic to go with Basic Attack change

7. Magi Blessing is ""Changing""

8. Erez says the Guan changes are not for a few more weeks. Will feature a change to him being Physical, as well as him riding a horse (Not sure if constant or only during Ult. There are other posts in more detail of Guan's changes).

9. ""Hel is still being worked on (she is a lot of work to redo)"". 

10. Sun Wukong is in about 6 weeks
 
11. New Conquest Visuals are coming in about 2 weeks. 

12. NEW Game Mode being shown at Gamescon (""New game mode is funny and frantic""). 

13. New servers are being announced at Gamescon 

14. There is a new Smite cinematic trailer being created

This would include several types of aiming practice:

Moving target practice: Try to hit a bot programmed to juke. The current bots kinda do this already so it can't be that hard to implement.

Shooting course: Similar to a gun shooting course, you have to go though and hit targets that pop up while trying to make it to the end. Time trial based.

Twitch shooting: Surrounded by targets, they highlight to indicate an active target. Good to train snapping at specific degrees such as right behind you, ect. Kinda like the simon says toy if you need an idea of what I mean.

Assassin slayer: A melee bot is attacking you, you need to keep on him. Melee range being the bane of radc, this would be awesome to have.

These are just some ideas of modes, but it would be cool if it kept a score and would deduct for misses and whatnot. Very similar to the exact aiming training on the below site, but more Smite specific.
http://aim400kg.ru/

Perhaps even a leaderboard so you can show off your mad accuracy, but mostly to keep track of your progress. 
Anyways, I feel a game that's all about skillshots should have a way to practice them.

Secondly, it would be cool if you could queue for matches while in a practice mode, this would encourage players to make use of their queue times while still improving, don't know if it's possible here, but its been done in other games, so it would be cool to see here. It would make practice modes much more practical for players.

First off I would like to say I am generally new to ""Beta"" games, but I have been playing Smite since just after it came out of closed Beta.  Also this is not a post about the new meta.  

The game has changes multiple times since I started as Hi-Rez tries new things out.  It seems to me that they pay close attention to the community as should be apparent by the changes.  There has been a ton of complaints about the current state of the jungle and they are already looking to make a change.  New gods come out as do new items to constantly change the game. They have updated the map several times, including bringing in new effects and visuals.  There are still bugs, but they are constantly working those out as well.  The community is constantly growing and changing, and with that what people want out of the game is changing and all in all Hi-Rez is trying to keep up with demands.

At a given moment we came to the idea of an army apollo skin.



***Abilities:***

**Passive:** When apollo's passive activates he starts using a double pistol.

**1st ability:** He shoots with a shotgun 

**2nd ability:** He throws a stunbomb and puts a gasmask on.

**3rd ability:** He rolls over the ground and shoots around him.

**Ultimate:** He calls for a spitfire with a walkie-talkie, gets picked up by it and when he goes down he jumps out of the plane while the plane is shooting at the ground. 

Please give feedback, cause I thought it was a pretty good idea :)

The skin itself is Odin wearing gardener clothes (Like those that a farmer would wear). Instead of his spear, Odin would be wielding either a pitchfork or a giant shovel. 
His leap doesn't have much that can be changed. 
His AS steroid can show a flower instead of the purple ring. 
The Gungnir's Might can spread out leaves and flowers like how the feathers go about in his 400 gem skin. 
For his ultimate the rings can be white fencing like the ones you see at any garden. And maybe flowers inside the fencing as well.

1370691240.0,82,self.Smite,1fx6yz,Let's talk about Xbalanque,Kobrokai,98,16,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1fx6yz/lets_talk_about_xbalanque/,"In this post, I will be showcasing a major flaw that is present for Xbalanque which is almost certainly a bug. I'd like to preface this by saying that Xbalanque isn't a bad god, however, he is at a severe and frankly unfair disadvantage due to this flaw/bug I'll outline, particularly when compared to other gods.

The  point I wish to bring up I believe is a bug rather than a design choice, that lies with Xbalanque's second ability, Poison Darts. I spoke briefly with Bart about it in the twitch chat for this weeks Deicide show, and he did state that it was intended, however I'm not sure he understood what I was saying. 

So, the issue. Most gods in the game can have their instant cast abilities (note: not channeled) interrupted before damage is done, and rightly so. It's an important part of competitive games to be able to react and counter what your opponent has in store for you. It's why crowd control exists. However, Xbalanque is the ONLY god in the game who can have his instant cast abilities interrupted AND lose the cooldown. Essentially, with both Xbalanque's 2nd and 3rd skills, he can be interrupted while casting, thus not technically activating his ability (no projectiles or damage), however the cooldown is still taken. 

This is best illustrated by the following video created by Fest and Safari: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh6c1sa9P0E

Now, those who pay more attention to the details will notice that Xbalanque has a bit of a lead up with his Poison Darts animation, he has a quick animation before any darts are released. There are many gods with this same sort of build up before they deal damage, the most obvious that comes to mind is Wukong's Overhead Smash. That skill has a massive wind up time, and it's very easy to tell when to interrupt. However, if Wukong is interrupted, he never loses the cooldown. This is consistent across all gods with wind up animations; all of them except Xbalanque. Is this fair? Is this necessary? Personally, I think not, Xbalanque already has a ton of problems (easy to avoid ultimate, the multiple issues with his 3) and adding this one, which occurs far too frequently and is easy to exploit, just weighs down further on an already non-competitive god.

The same issue also lies with Xbalanque's Rising Jaguar, however I believe this is an intended design choice. I don't feel it's necessary, especially when there are “luxury” dashes (not essential to their success) like Agni's, which are CC immune, yet Xbalanque's is vital, and easily interrupted before any damage or mobility can be gained. As players, what do you guys feel? Do you think it's necessary that Xbalanque can have his core skill interrupted to easily without any beneficial effects whatsoever? Should the damage be guaranteed? Should he have CC immunity?

Once again, credit goes out to Safari and Fest for doing the leg work and providing evidence for Xbalanque's unfortunate situation.",MISC,False,,t5_2stl8,False,fluff,manticore,True,t3_1fx6yz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1fx6yz/lets_talk_about_xbalanque/,

Therefore I believe we have had enough time to evaluate this item and therefore lets discuss what the thoughts of the players are.

I personally feel like the item was a really good idea but I honestly don't think its fitting into the Smite that I (and others I know) love.

The mask has resulted in there being 2 lanes where its 2v1 during all laning phase. This has resulted in laning phase being the most boring aspect of the game and now the first 10 minutes of the game is absolutely boring and you just wait for a 3v1 or 2v2 situation on lanes where you have the advantage due to element of surprise.

Additionally there is no structure anymore since you can't call the guy missing. Sure you will be able to ward but the opponent team is able to ward aswell so you will almost never know where the junglers is. Additionally I see in a lot of matches people grouping up after 5 minutes since the laning phase has been completely neutralized anyways.

In short I think this item is really bad for smite and the fast gameplay I loved about Smite is gone and all you do now is PvE without even trying to PvP until you reach the 15 minute mark or so.

I just wanted to start a discussion about god kits and problems going forward. At the moment when you watch a tourny the god selection is very predictable indeed.

Lets look at a few regular picks;


Anhur - ADC, has a slow, a knockback, a stun, a leap, cc immunity on his ult.

Apollo - Has a dash, a Mez and an ult to easily escape.

Athena - Has a dash, a taunt, a global ult to escape

Sobek, Has a dash, a heal reduction, some disruption and cc immunity in ult.

Thor - A stun, A teleport, huge aoe damage, an ult that can initiate/escape.


The main concern I have is that in order to see different gods in high end play they have to have comparable kits or they won't be picked.

Hi Rez simply can't release gods with similar kits to Artemis/Anubis (perfectly designed gods imo) as they will be bottom of the pack and never picked.

So what Hi Rez has to do is release abominations like Tyr, with a leap ult, two charges that both cc, a heal all along with huge dps. He will be first pick first ban mark my words.

The only way Hi Rez can introduce more gods into the competitive scene is to bloat their kits. People are already complaining about mobility/cc but surely the only path Hi Rez can take is to add more mobility and CC, if they don't the pool of gods used in competitive play will forever stay the same.

Is anyone else a bit worried? I don't see too many options for god design going forward at the moment

1376098854.0,76,self.Smite,1k2cw0,Suggestion Game Mode: The Maze,Ramrok,95,19,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1k2cw0/suggestion_game_mode_the_maze/,"Oooooooooo, ok here's my pitch:
Have a maze map with walls you cannot see through or past unless you are using flying ultimates... you can still blink or jump past walls as well.
A minotaur spawns in the map and roams around, automatically agroing to the closest player and breaking through ability obstacles (similar to regular minotaur) HOWEVER, this minotaur is unkillable and walks slightly faster then standard movement speed (+35% or 40%) so that he can gain on gods unless you use dash, jumps or gain additional movement speed from items or god abilities.

Objective:
The first team to reach 20 kills on the enemy team wins. Minotaur killing a person gives the other team a kill point towards their goal to get 20 kills.

Simple objective, however since everyone starts at level 3 or 5 you will be very weak and will have to farm from the many jungle camps to gain level. EXP and Gold gain is high like in arena/assault (whichever is highest) so that players do not have to spend too much time farming and get time to gank enemy teams around the map or by camps and at the same time avoid the minotaur.

Wards, Eye of Providence and Sprint are restricted from this game mode to allow the presence of the Minotaur to cause the necessary amount of fear and teamwork to deal with both the enemy team and stay clear of the minotaur.

This game mode has no minions or towers and no gold fury or firegiant just an intricate maze with paths both wide and narrow to provide various traps or strategies. Smart teams will use the minotaur to their advantage to keep the enemy closer to him as the minotaur will have no allegiance to any team and will kill whatever is closest to him. Discuss, chip in, MAKE IT HAPPEN.

Another suggested idea for the name: The Labyrinth.

EDIT: Other points that have been brought up in comments below are:

Random select god, to avoid cherry picking gods with best mobility and best visibility and aoe's.

Certainly the Minotaur would have his own weaknesses so hes optimal and not overpowered... I said slowing down around the corner, maybe every 5 swings he stops moving and attacking for a few secs (fatigue?) then resumes.

Maps could varry, and likely Hi-Rez will put their own spin to it as they always do but it would be great to have some variations to it certainly. Some suggestions where to have some paths close, and walls open...

I would say the Minotaur to start in the middle of the map... players start on the side much like in Domination, but the Minotaur cannot be lured inside the spawn and will loose agro on players that are inside their spawn. Shop is only available inside the spawn.

Recalling and Shielded Recall are also prohibited in this game mode like in Assault, however you can certainly walk back through the jungle to your spawn and access the shop to buy stuff.

Minotaur could deduct a point from the team of the player that he has killed instead of giving a point to the enemy team, urging players to be cautious.",SUGGESTION,False,,t5_2stl8,1376178588.0,suggestion,ares,True,t3_1k2cw0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1k2cw0/suggestion_game_mode_the_maze/,

Labyrinth mode, so basically what you do is 3v3 or 5v5 teams that go up against each other in a completley hidden map with random buffs and minion spawns, the sight radius is reduced and you can get lost easily. This part of the mode encourages players to buy wards, you can go back to base unlike assualt but you lose your place on the map. It encourages close tight knit groups and the goal of the mode is to defeat the minotaur who does slightly reduced damage (just so if you accidently   see him you won't get hurt too bad) and can be found in the center of the map. I would love if Hi-Rez could get a few maps and rotate them randomly so no one can fully map out the environment and just win like that with all the buffs. I really like the idea and my friend and I are excited about it. Maybe if someone from Hi-Rez can see it then they could pass the message along? Ik its a long shot but never hurts to try right?

Now that Hi-Rez is going to let social media platforms handle their player and moderator interaction this topic needs to be brought up again.

There is absolutely no argument that can be given against giving players the options to select if they want to region lock the servers they play on. I am not saying force NA and EU players to only play on their own servers but to give players the ability to pick that option if they want to.

I live on the west coast and server pings are already bad enough. I know the NA servers are on the east coast but compared to other games I can get better pings on east coast servers in those games then I do in Smite.

When I get stuck on an EU server it becomes almost impossible to play effectively. I have no way of knowing what server I am going to be on until after I pick a god and trying to play a god who relies on skill shots becomes an exercise in futility when on an EU server.

The servers in general also have horrible lag compensation as it is. I don't know if they are simply no powerful enough to handle all the traffic but at no time should I see my spell animation, hear the voice que that goes with that spell but the spell does not actually go off. 

I have the CPU and GPU power to run Smite 5 times over so it's not an issue on my end and it's not my ISP either with speeds of 50Mbps down and 10Mbps up. I've tested my internet numerous times with excellent speed results, and no packet loss or jitter.

You obviously need more servers and more powerful servers in general but at the very least give us the ability to region lock so we can avoid servers outside our regional area.

1375932154.0,72,self.Smite,1jxkn7,Let's talk Anubis... From a High Ranking Masochist with Rank 10,ScythemanCT,85,13,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1jxkn7/lets_talk_anubis_from_a_high_ranking_masochist/,"(Warning: Wall of Text Inc)

So as the title states I am a player currently in the top 100 of the leaderboards, and I've found myself playing an unbearable amount of Anubis (to test my awareness and such). And, after torturing myself like this for a few weeks, and with all the talk of reworks lately, I've decided that a post is in order. So tonight, I'm going to lay out not only why i believe Anubis to be in need of change, but ways that I believe he could be changed for the better.

With that said, I'd like to start with where Anubis stands in comparison to other mages and about his role in general. Anubis serves the joint role of mage and assassin, by design leaning towards the latter. Right now, his primary (and truthfully only) job as a character is to CC and demolish a single carry with damage beyond comparison. The problem here is that ultimately he is lackluster in both roles. While his damage is high, it is ultimately unreliable due to an increasing amount of counters to CC and the ability to sidestep most of his damage by simply alternating A and D keystrokes. Conversely, he doesn't bring nearly as much team utility or safety than most other mages currently in the game. These factors ultimately lead to a character that can pubstomp and take advantage mistakes or miscalculations, but is quite easy to shut down. So the question becomes how to we address this issue while maintaining the intended playstyle of the character? Well let's start from the top.

Sorrow (passive): All of Anubis' abilities steal physical and magical protection (7 per tick) from the target. In addition, Sorrow grants Anubis an additional 30% reduction to all crowd control durations and 33% bonus magical lifesteal per stack. Max 3 stacks.

Now this ability really is the bread and butter Anubis. It provides him a fair amount of defensive stats while also weakening any enemies hit. This is what makes Anubis damage so scary, but in reality the extra defenses don't do much to discourage aggression because they are relatively unsafe to build up given his current kit. Overall it's a good passive that supports a 'stand and deliver' style of play. The only thing i would change here is the lifesteal numbers. I would like to see them reverted to a 5% flat per stack. Anubis struggles most with early game pressure and ganks, so reverting this to a flat number allows him to be slightly safer by keeping his HP pool up. Moving on...

Plague of Locusts: A plague of locusts bellows forth from Anubis' mouth, smothering all enemies in the area and doing damage every .5s for 3s. Anubis is stationary for the duration of the channel, but can not be knocked up.

The description I've put here lacks some important information so I'm going to describe a bit more about the skill. The range is quite small (about 30 meters if memory serves) but it has a very wide arcing area. It also does an absurd amount of damage (enough to clear archers at level 1 with standard items) and scales really well per tick (40% i think). The thing that makes this skill problematic is the fact that it makes you stationary, meaning that you are an easy target for EVERYTHING for an entire 3 seconds. Not only that but it's very easy to cancel. Now, would making him able to move (even at reduced speed) or cc immune for the duration be balanced? Probably not, nor would it be fun or satisfying. This is the only skill that I think needs a full retooling to make a more fluid character. For an example, I present these changes. 

Plague of Locust: Anubis sends out a swarm of locust, smothering all enemies hit applying a DoT that deals damage every .75 seconds for 3 seconds. At the end of the duration, or upon death, the affliction spreads to any unaffected enemies within 20 feet. Enemies can only be afflicted once per cast. Range remains the same, arc is tightened (to be more like Water Cannon). Base damage and scaling remain the same, cooldown perhaps adjusted.

So let's look at what this does. First of all it solves the major problem of a stationary channel that makes him nothing more than a target, allowing him a safer time in lane as well as team fights. It also allows him to keep up his passive both on himself and enemies. Additionally, it gives him a surefire way to apply stacks to both aggressors and gankers, making him scarier to simply engage on. Now, I can't simply make the skill better without taking away, seeing as the original was balanced yet fundamentally flawed. The first con here is that I removed 33% of the damage from the skill, which in reality could still not be enough. I've also shrunken the AoE, but kept the low range, in order to preserve the sense of danger while making the skill slightly harder to hit. I'd also like to mention the idea of a short cast animation, as another form of balance without hitting the numbers too hard. Overall the goal was to make him less of a sitting duck and more useful in a fight, without adding the traditional derpy speedboost/steroid/get-out-of-jail-free-card. Ultimately forcing you to be aware but allowing you to be scary to engage on, something I'd also like to address with mummify.

Mummify: Anubis fires a bandage projectile, mummifying and stunning his target.

A simple yet satisfying skillshot, or at least it would be if every other mage didn't have better CC that's easier to hit. Now I say that, but I wouldn't want to alter the nature of the skill itself. It has always been one of the most satisfying skills in the game to land, and altering that basic idea could possibly ruin all fun in the character. So instead I choose to add a bit to the skill text that adds depth and makes even scarier to engage on too hard. 

Anubis fires a bandage projectile, mummifying and stunning his target. If the target has 3 stacks of Sorrow applied the protections reduced are doubled, and the cooldown of Mummify halved.

Now i know you guys will probably think I'm crazy but hear me out. The biggest thing people complain about with Anubis is a lack of escape. However, instead of outright giving him one, why not make him a god that is incredibly scary and intimidating to simply jump on? This mummify change is a step in that direction. The most important thing to note is that this only occurs when a player has 3 stacks already applied, meaning that you would have already had to done some form of damage. Now, with the previous change to Locust I made it possible to do damage reliably on the retreat, and grasping hands can already be used both offensive and defensively, so this change is targeted to make people thing about their approach on Anubis. The reward being an obvious swing in survivability, as well as the impending threat of another wrap. Of course, none of this matters if you miss. Alternately, I'd like Hirez to think about other bonus' that could be given under the 3 stack condition... If mine seems too off the wall, that is.

Grasping Hands...
To be honest, I'm not going to bother with this. My wall of text is already huge and I think that this is pretty balanced. Kudos to Hirez for this one.

Death Gaze: Anubis focuses all of his energy into a piercing gaze, doing damage to all enemies in the path, every 0.3 seconds for 3 seconds.

Now, I'm gonna be blunt here. There's an obvious problem with this skill but I'm not quite sure what the best solution is. The issue is that the ult is too easy to sidestep. Period. It's the only ult in the game that can be completely countered by using the A and D keys. The problem is that the skill itself feels good on the character. It fits the kit and the design, and changing it would have the same feel as changing Mummify. So the best I've been able to come up with (and it wasn't even my idea) is to change the skill tick every .1 seconds. Simply put, it allows for more adjustments made with less damage gaps to take advantage of. Obviously between his passive and other changes made the overall damage of Death Gaze would have to come down for balance sake, but to be able to hit more reliably it's worth it.

So that's what I have for you. For anyone who read through it all thank you for your time, and I would love feedback. For everyone else...

TLDR: Anubis bad please change.

EDIT: I'd like to thank everyone for taking the time to read and post responses. At some point I'd like to see some Hirez faces chime in as well but that's wishful thinking. 
I also came to another conclusion for Death Gaze. Perhaps make it a long range cone with a tiny width, and make damage dealt to subsequent enemies mitigated by 30-50%? This way it becomes easier to hit reliably, but is still punishable by poor positioning or teamplay. Just spitballing here of course.

1365158593.0,70,self.Smite,1bq4te,Advice on how to lose a lane without feeding,fabric9,83,13,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1bq4te/advice_on_how_to_lose_a_lane_without_feeding/,"**1. INTRODUCTION**

I feel like this is something that a lot of people fail at. Even me, occasionally, though I've started analyzing this a bit closer lately, and thought I'd write down some conclusions I came to, and maybe people will appreciate it. There are a lot of parallels to draw here with other MOBA's, such as League, so a lot of this will be ""common sense"" to a lot of you.

Assume that you give up first blood, double kill to their carry. It doesn't matter what kind of lane you're in, that's a bad start. It doesn't matter why it happened - be it bad luck, bad decisions, whatever. **ASSUME** that it happened. How do you deal with it from that point onwards, without dying every time you come back to lane? That's what this document is meant to address. It's mostly aimed towards side lanes, as they snowball a lot easier than midlane, and midlane is typically a lot easier to play defensive in.

**2. STAGE FIVE OF LOSING: ACCEPTANCE**

Jumping past a few stages of grieving, you need to arrive at the final stage of losing as soon as possible; acceptance. The trick isn't to turn the lane around and win it, it's to win the *game*. Noone cares if you lost your lane (except you maybe), if at the end of the day you're able to win the game anyway.

The first step is to accept that you can't fight the enemy straight up in a fair fight. They are ahead of you in gold and experience. They can take fights in bad situations and still win. They can fight in minion disadvantage, maybe even in a 2v3, and still get out of it even, or ahead.

Play defensively. Don't let them catch you in a fight, ever. Don't ever engage on them. If they attempt to engage on you, use your abilities defensively - not offensively. This becomes literally impossible for some lanes, as the CC advantages may lie heavily in the favor of the opponents, and in those cases you should simply not be in lane any longer when the enemies are there. Which brings us to...

**3. KNOW YOURSELF AND KNOW YOUR ENEMY**

In the immortal words of Sun Tzu, if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles. In other words, if you know precisely what the enemy can do to you, and how you can counter it, you will survive every time.

Look at their items and abilities whenever they come back to lane. Realize that Ymir built Boots of Celerity and got a Heavenly Agility *before* he sprints at you with them and forces a fight that you could've avoided. Get abilities to counter their hard engages when possible. For example, get Aegis and Beads *before* that Ares hits you with ultimate, not after he killed you with it.

If Bacchus stun is a threat to you, then save your stun/mez to interrupt his burp. If Ares chains your carry, bodyblock the following chains for your carry. Smart plays like that will save the engage and allow you to escape. Think about what their skills are, how they'll use them to force a fight, and how you can use yours to counter it.

**4. WARDS AND VISION**

I see this all the time in games. Lets say you're losing a lane so hard that the only thing stopping them from killing you over and over is that Tier 1 tower at your back. They push the lane, and then leave through the jungle. You stay out of range of them when they're in the lane, call missing when they leave, and then you push it right back to their tower. They return to the lane through your jungle, and force a fight on you. You die.

Another alternative I see often, but not quite as often, is when they are losing a lane they *don't* push their lane when their opposition leaves. They literally freeze the lane at their tower, allow their opposition to roam freely (unwarded), and they end up ganking both other lanes, snowballing the whole *game* instead of just their lane. I've even seen them try to counter-roam, which just ends up poorly (the opponents bring more to the gank than they do to the counter-gank, as we've already established their opposition is *ahead* of them).

The trick here is to know when to push and when not to. If all they're doing is dipping into the jungle to take a buff and coming back, don't bother pushing. Just stall the lane, wait for them to come back, let them push, and then take the safe exp/gold you can get. As soon as you see them roaming for a gank, however - push, and push hard. You need to get the tower if they end up ganking another lane, to make it an even trade.

The *only* way to make these calls safely is to use wards to gain vision. You may have to counter-ward actively to accomplish this as well. As long as you are able to keep your opponents from leaving the lane, you are losing the lane, but you're not losing the *game*, which is the important thing.

**5. TOWER DIVE. WE MUST TOWER DIVE.**

When it gets to the point that they're eagerly waiting to tower dive you, there are a few things you can do to prevent extra losses. First, if their mid is missing, just give up the tower. You can't survive a 2v3 tower dive when you're behind. Give up the tower, let mid push their lane, and defend at the T2 tower instead. One T1 tower is not the end of the world, and it won't set your team far enough behind to snowball the enemy team to victory.

If on the other hand they get two kills and *then* get the tower, that might just be enough for them to get other objectives (gold fury / mid t1 tower / your t2 tower), and *that* might be enough for them to snowball the game to victory.

Second, you need to recognize when this is about to happen beforehand. A counter-initiation from your opposite lane is probably the best bet. Ask them to push their lane real fast and have the carry from that lane go back and roam to your lane through the jungle. If done right, he'll be there in time to counter-initiate the tower dive and you might just get a double kill out of it.

If your teammates aren't willing to help you, there's nothing you can do about it. Don't blame them for it - there may be attenuating circumstances, they might be losing their lane as well, etc - but if they can't help, there's nothing for it. Give up the tower as lost, and let them know beforehand. Hopefully you have ward coverage to protect mid, who will now be extremely open for ganks from your lane, as you'll have a much harder time to keep pressure on your lane opposition.

**6. SUMMARY**

I hope this helps a few of you guys out there who are new to the game and find themselves feeding their lanes way too often, and want to improve. Also, if you feel like adding something, let me know! I'll try to squeeze it in somewhere in this wall of text... :)",[TIPS &amp; TRICKS],False,,t5_2stl8,1365170832.0,,athena,True,t3_1bq4te,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1bq4te/advice_on_how_to_lose_a_lane_without_feeding/,

In every online game I've ever played, language ends up being a significant barrier to teamwork and friendly play.  But Smite can circumvent this quite easily, with some very, *very* simple changes.

As it is now, the Voice Command System makes the announcer say the command while a pop-up appears on the screen.  I would think it would be very simple to allow players in the lobby to select a ""preferred language,"" and then have the command pop-up appear in said language.

Voice recordings in the other languages could come later... the important part here is the text pop-up on screen being translated.

Imagine how much easier it would be for English speaking players to cooperate with Spanish, Russian, whatever else speakers when pressing [VSAA] announces ""I'll Attack"" to each individual player in their native language.

This seems like such an obvious idea to me.  And the ease of implementation should make it a priority, in my opinion... hell, the community could band together on this and use Google Translate to do the bulk of the work.  Some simple QA after that and then some text-replace in the code, and ta-da.  No more language barrier.

After playing DotA and then HoN and then DotA2, I'm hoping Smite can be the game that ends the hate towards foreign players.

*Generally, if you wipe the enemy team, it might be preferable for you or your low health allies to suicide under a tower -- without giving kill credit to an opposing player -- so that you can buy items, respawn with full health, and be back in time to defend against your opponents. But remember, be weary of those ""tag"" timers! If you were recently hit by an opponent, you might give kill credit accidentally.*

**2. Stacking items are a fine pick-up; just avoid Doom Orb and Heartseeker.**

*Only snowball items were banned in LoL ARAMs; not all stacking items. Moreover, those banned items only stacked off of kills and assists, so they reached maximum potential very easily if a player just stayed passive and survived while everyone else died (commonly referred to as ""abusing assists""). There are no similar items in Smite. This is a common misunderstanding in our community (and I have no clue where it started).*

**3. Communicate about who is going to build Bracers of Replenishment.**

*It's an item that is absolutely essential for this game-type. Don't be the team that misses out on the powerful early sustain. Additionally, don't be afraid to take advantage of other aura and debuff benefits!*

**4. Build based on your team comp and the enemy's team comp.**

*This isn't conquest and you don't have a say in how your team will be composed -- character selection wise. If you and your allies random five magical characters, it might be smart to have one of you build for physical damage. In a Conquest game, this would most certainly be ""trolling."" But, trust me, it's not in this game-type.*

**5. Have fun!**

*Assault is not meant to be a competitive game-type. And while some tips (like what I've posted above) may improve your experience, you should really use Assault as an opportunity to relax, try new things, and meet/learn about your fellow community members.*",[TIPS &amp; TRICKS],False,,t5_2stl8,1365704636.0,,caster,True,t3_1c5etl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1c5etl/assault_queue_aka_aram_launches_tomorrow_here_are/,

Since Bumba's came out I just don't enjoy it anymore. The gameplay it promotes just isn't doing it for me.



The problem with Bumba's is that it promotes new roles that I don't enjoy, couple this with the fact that i'm a solo queuer and there is a problem.



Because of the terrible matchmaking system i'm always chucked in with semi premades. Usually two two man teams or a four man team. This happens in 50% of my games.



As soon as this happens i'm told to mid. I have no choice. Now I used to enjoy mid, win the lane gank the sides etc etc. Now I have to sit near enough to my tower so that when jungle fenrir/ne zha/thor etc etc pops out to gank I can survive. IT IS BORING.



Actually to clarify what is boring in my opinion;



Solo lane is BORING



Two man lane zoning out the solo laner is BORING



Mid is BORING (due to jungler threat)



Jungling is fun for the Junger alone. I've got 900 wins on Smite and was aiming for 1000. I don't see myself making it as I've played maybe 10 games since Bumbas came out and due to not enjoying it am playing less and less each day.

I know this is probably a regurgitated post covering whats been covered before on these forums but i'm just so disappointed with how the game is heading I just had to :(

Right i'm gonna play some games. Might play some scrolls/neverwinter/van helsings - I won't be playing Smite. :(

I've played countless matches, and spent a fair amount of money on the god pack and gems.

The entire reason I liked it so much was because of the constant give and take in an action setting.  I also really enjoyed the relative balance, the idea that no single player would get so far ahead of everyone else unless they actually beat their opposition fairly thoroughly.

Now you have introduced a total PvE meta in which one player is virtually guaranteed to become a machine of death unless the opposing team has the cohesion to counter it.  Which simply doesn't happen very often in public matches where the players don't typically share voice communication.  And to top it all off you've also forced an individual to play a lane solo, which is about as much fun as watching paint dry.  Perhaps less so, since at least you're accomplishing something if you've been painting.

Stop trying to copy every other game in the genre...  SMITE is NOT League of Legends...  SMITE is NOT Defense of the Ancients...  SMITE is NOT Heroes of Newerth.  If we wanted to play those games, we'd be playing those games instead of SMITE.  

Given the reaction of the /r/Smite community, the request to remove the item has been overwhelmingly popular.  So you are left with two choices...  listen to the individuals who actually play your game and will ultimately determine whether it is profitable or not.  Or you can ignore them. (The second option tends to fail spectacularly).

**Edit**:  Folks, the problem isn't in the high-tier play...  but it's a problem in pub matches where you can't rely on having the teamwork to counter such a silly item.  It forces extremely passive play, or extreme snowballing, in the vast majority of pub matches featuring a single competent jungler.  If you design the game solely around high level play with an overly complex meta, you're going to end up with fewer and fewer of the new players sticking around long enough to become high level players.",MISC,False,,t5_2stl8,1370832269.0,fluff,reason,True,t3_1g073g,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1g073g/hirez_specifically_erez_read_this_post/,

As far as I know, Smite isn't as a big of deal as LoL, but you guys still continuously pump out a better experience. By all means I am not saying I don't like League of Legends, it's just there are some things to note here.

*Hi-Rez has a daily different game type (among others), it takes Riot years apparently to make just one. 

*Hi-Rez has reskinned their maps multiple times, Riot refuses to do anything but holiday themed ones.

*Hi-Rez offers really, really cool character skins (some free) and voice packs, Riot does only skins, for anywhere between 5-30$

*Has amazing player stats and god ranks, among many other neat features out of game. Riot has only ELO.

Again, I like both companies and play League a lot, but I just wanted to say how much more I'm digging Hi-Rez's approach to everything. Especially considering it's still beta; which I guess doesn't mean much because Dota 2 is still beta!

Thank you for bearing with us these last few days as we get everything set up and are moving towards this new theme, rules, and system in general.

First order of business. We are looking for a few extra mods to help us out. We really want to get a full fleshed out mod team so that we have a full team for the future of the subreddit, and to help lessen the work load on each individual mod. 

The application will be through the google doc below. Make sure to fill out all questions the best you can to be considered. 

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lWzt3d65_rM9znklSpXVPnZYxdK9zkXrlfDyBg0D5wY/viewform

There are a few other things to discuss. 

Flair: With the new theme, we ended up getting rid of the old flair. Right now we have God Flair, Hi-Rez and Mod flair, and team flair. Team flair is given to the teams that consistenly place top 3 in either of the tournaments. I believe we are missing Snipe, but that is about it. (If we are missing another let me know).This is to keep the flair from getting cluttered like it was before. 

Rule Changes: We may still be adding rules, so please keep checking up. Remember, the main focus is to keep the subreddit constructive and to promote discussion. If it is not, it may be subject to removal. We now have /r/gank for memes and /r/smitelfm for ""LFM"" (looking for more) posts. If you post either of those, it will be removed and we will tell you to post it on one of those. Some of the new rules include: No bug posts, no complaining/bragging, no memes, no lfm, and no selling.

Again, thank you very much for bearing with us through all of this and I wish you the best of luck if you are applying for a moderator position!

Edit: We will be closing this at the end of today, so make sure to get your application.

1369557193.0,66,self.Smite,1f2oau,Need to get this off my chest...,Styruhfoam,86,20,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1f2oau/need_to_get_this_off_my_chest/,"I apologize that there is a wall of text incoming, but I quite need to get this off my chest, and I would greatly appreciate it if you took the time to read it. Thanks in advance.

I know that what I'm about to complain about can't be effectively dealt with without a lot of effort; as such I'll accept the possibility that it might never be dealt with to begin with. Perhaps my plight is a niche problem; maybe there are not enough people suffering from this issue, and thus won't garner the attention needed to fix it. But I'd like to bring a shred of attention to it if not to express my own frustration as a personal outlet for venting.

For a while now, I've been playing with 300+ ping in Smite thanks to living in South East Asia. If not for my love for this game I would likely have quit long ago. But I pushed through it. It was a painful process learning to adapt to lead my skill shots, landing hooks and stuns and walls. My stats suffered quite greatly for it because of the early phases of my involvement in Smite, which was riddled with loss and defeat. But after much practice and pain, I broke even, and did decently. My stats still aren't great, but I use that as motivation to improve them. I still miss that Aegis by a second and get blown up by a Kraken, and I still miss that one auto attack needed to snag that kill; it fills me with frustration when they get away or I die not because I don't have skill, but because of something I can't control like internet connection. It does disappoint me knowing that no matter how good I get, I'll never be as great as I know I can be if I had better ping, but it's something I dealt with.

But now, for reasons I have no understanding of, merely speculation, my ping has become wildly out of control. I go from 200 - 1000 ping in seconds. And it happens far too frequently in critical moments where team fights were lost because I went from frozen in place in one moment, to a flurry of dead teammates in the next. I've learned to play with that 1 second lag from click to auto-attack by leading targets, but I simply can't learn to adapt to this. Moving in one direction for a second, and moving endlessly forward even with my hands of the keys, and then dying to the tower I just walked forward to. It's not possible. The thought that the effort I've put into the game to adapt to my unfortunate circumstances would be washed away by an insurmountable obstacle pains me. It really does. As I've said before, I don't know where this problem stems from; be it Hi-Rez's own unstable servers or something that went wrong on my end. This uncertainty compounds my frustration, showing to me that I have no control over this problem.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying my life is over thanks to this. Life goes on, man. However, it still disappoints me that I might have lost another element of my life that I enjoy and put a good amount of effort into. I understand it's not Hi-Rez's responsibility to accommodate every single player out there, I don't blame them. If they made the servers stable, or even better, start a SEA server; I'd be grateful. But if they can't or they won't; there won't be spite, just self disappointment. I know there are a lot of people who have it much worse than I do, and please don't reply in saying so. What I'm saying doesn't discount that fact, this is simply my own means of expressing my personal perspective.

I'm sorry that I can't be the best teammate to you guys because of this. It frustrates me just as much as it frustrates you. I've had experiences where I've done well but my teammates don't and we lose because of it. And I won't hesitate to admit that I'm guilty of blaming them. And it's a fact that I am greatly sorry for. It's only recently I've learnt that there are things that we can't see going on behind that person's screen, and maybe it's not all their fault they're doing badly. I've burdened my teammates before with incompetence, and if it wasn't for that stage, I wouldn't be the player I am now. It's only fair that I should allow them the liberty to push through that phase as well. For every bit of frustration that comes with a bad team, there might be even more that comes from the other person.

As far as I can tell there are currently four gods in development (two new gods and two reworks). I'll detail information pertaining to each of these gods below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Tyr**

Tyr is a physical melee god. His gameplay mechanics will revolve around stance switching (assault/aggressive and guard/defensive stances).

Passives - Tyr will have a seperate passive in each stance. Passives will grant Tyr an on-hit buff proc which will then go on cooldown for a set amount of time before the passive proc can be used again. Tyr wields a sword in one hand and a cannon for the other.

1. **Charge* / Self Buff* (Aggressive / Defensive)** - Charges enemy god and added debuff effect. / Tyr applies a defensive buff to himself.

2. **Horizontal Hit (Aggressive / Defensive)** - Knocks any god into the air and additional bonus effect based upon which stance Tyr is currently in.

3. **AA Buff* / Cannon* (Aggressive / Defensive)** - Applies an auto attack buff to Tyrs sword for X seconds / Fires a medium ranged nuke projectile in a line in front of Tyr.

4. **Ultimate** - Switches stances, but also has a leap attached to it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Zhong Kui**

Zhong Kui is a physical ranged god. His gameplay mechanics will revolve around buffing/debuffing and potential demon pet mechanics. He will be heavily themed around orbs, scrolls, and demons. Will also have an entity attached to him (a scroll) which will take up physical space in the game world. His projectiles will be orbs.

*Order of abilities unknown at this time. Some of these abilities may be toggles or two step abilities, so more than five will be shown).*

**Book of Demons** - Marks and removes mark on enemy and friendly gods.

**Expose Evil** - Projectile based attack.

**Exorcism** - This ability builds charges and has a potential phase shift attached to it. This phase shift may only be cosmetic however.

**Fierce Glare** - Deploys demon entity into the game world. 

**Recall Demon** - Usable on both enemy and friendly gods. Brings some benefit back to Zhong Kui upon use.

**Ultimate Demon** - More than likely Zhong Kui's ultimate. Shoots out a massive demon projectile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Guan Yu Version 2**

Fortified Defense, Tranquil Gift and Warrior's Will all seem to work the exact same or very similar to how they work currently.

Taolu Assault is not mentioned in his updated kit, but instead appears to have been replaced with a ""mini"" version of his current ultimate Tactician's Advantage.

*Wanted to add some clarification to this section. Taolu Assault is not mentioned with a V2 tag like the rest of his abilities are in the files. Instead we have his new ultimate and his old ultimate both mentioned with the V2 tag. This lead me to believe that Taolu Assault has been replaced, but may NOT be the case. Don't freak out.*

4. **Gallop Away** - Guan Yu's new ultimate ability involving his trusted warhorse. Gallop Away has three phases. Each phase lasts for a set amount of time and has a corresponding and scaling movement speed buff attached to it. Seems to function similar to Vamana's dash in terms of turning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Hel Version 2**

Jingle Hel is getting reworked as part of V2 and will launch alongside the release of the new default model.

Stance switching works just like it does on live.

Has a healing beam as one of her new / altered abilities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Other**

The furies show up in the game files as named NPCs (Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone).

**Any ability marked with an * is for placeholder name purposes only.**

If you are a youtuber, streamer, a website, or really any content creator, please try and keep the posts down to about a week per post. It is hard for us mods to keep track of every post you make, so its not always possible. Just when posting, use your best judgement in the matter. If you have already posted this week, but say you have some huge announcement, then ok, we can be understanding. But we don't want every few days with basically the same stream/tourney/video/ect...

We want to promote community content. Everyone should have a chance to post their stuff, so we want to help get rid of some of the clutter so some of the streams that say aren't seen as much because they aren't upvoted so much have a chance to be seen. We also want reddit to be a place where you can get a decent viewerbase and then sustain on your own. Where eventually you can get the point where you don't need us, and other people can have their turn to shine.

Sorry for all the text, just wanted to make sure that everyone out there understands why we are trying to do this.

tl;dr Please keep self-promotion posts to about 1 post per week. Use your best judgement. We can be understanding if say you have a really important event/announcement. 

If you have any other ideas how we can maybe promote content creators without posts, feel free to let us know in the comments section.",MOD,False,,t5_2stl8,False,mod,mod,True,t3_1j9vjm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1j9vjm/psa_on_self_promotion/,
1373228320.0,58,self.Smite,1hti04,Smite as a community,Ashyko,92,34,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1hti04/smite_as_a_community/,"With my husband and two of my three children out-of-town, I've found time to think and write down my thoughts on Smite as a community. Please pardon the some what meandering nature these thoughts presented in here.

I first came to Smite because of my best friend. Competitive play had just begun, and owning a MacBook, I had never actually played. I watched the tournaments and read the HiRez forums. I found that the casters were knowledgable and presented information in a very accessible form for those who don't already know the game mechanics well. I found most of the community in the forums to friendly and full of ideas and love for Smite. This eventually all drove me to purchase a computer so I could play Smite, brought me to Denial eSports, and eventually, to reedit.

I don't know why, but the community seems to be changing dramatically - or maybe it isn't and reddit is just full of complainers. I see so many posts each day about what HiRez does wrong. About how some one acted on stream, who has conflicting interests, how so and so must be cheating... the list of complaints and criticism are fairly endless. Why, I now ask, is this the case? 

It all reminded me of an episode of The Guild (another thing Kaeyoh introduced me to). I'll link the episode here, but the general idea is that people (casters, players, developers) put their heart and soul into a game. For people like DMBrandon, MattyPocket, Qvofred, Bart, and all of the developers, Smite is their life and their passion.   

For us watching tournaments and playing, the game is fun. Smite fans are as devoted to their favorite teams and players, and we as fans are quite vocal about how we feel each week. Still, this game is someone's life. When you bash the developers and give no positive feedback at all, when you bring a swirling vortex of hate and misery with you to this game, it's as bad as telling a new mother that her baby is ugly and going to fail at life because she does. When you post in the smite twitch chat about how a player shouldn't be allowed to be on that channel because he's a liar or steals (and you have no first hand knowledge or evidence of either) you're slandering someone and costing them their life (and income). When you accuse people of cheating (for themselves or others) and you haven't witnessed it first hand or have substantial evidence, you call someone's life fake. When you accuse casters of being biased, of purposely trying to get teams disqualified, you're accusing someone of slander and again, could cost them their LIFE. 

It's very easy as an online sports fan to slander and slur others. It's easy, from the comfort of your home and the anonymity of your user name, to put down others and say things you would never have the courage or poor manners to say to their face. I understand that many of Smite's fans and players are young. Maybe some of them have difficult lives and putting down others makes them feel better, but our community as a whole should be filled with more positive than negative. We should be supporting those who love eSports. We should be cheering on every team that comes to competitive play.

As our community grows, we need the foundation of it, those of us who have been here since Beta, those who have been here since Alpha, to be the positives. So many negatives will come in as Smite grows, and it's highly unlikely that everyone will always agree, but if we can, from the beginning, establish this as a community of thoughtful individuals rather than hateful ones, then Smite will be a bigger success over all. Teams will want to compete each week because, win or lose, everyone is cheering for exciting matches and content. 

We all love Smite. We might not all love each other, but we are a community, and communities that support each other grow and flourish. Let's be that community.

The very second I show them a video of the real gameplay, they fall in love. This has happened about 12 times with my friends and I was confused into why. My friend told me it's because of it's appearance at first.

If you go through the Twitch page and see smite, you only see a benign picture of Odin and Arachne, so it won't catch much attention. At least some bright colors :D.

As a new player, my friend was in Low resolution mode and had no idea. He said the game looked unappealing because it's dark color. Maybe when a new player enters the system for the first time, have a window show allowing them to change it.

One final thing that's a turn-off from Smite, the coming from other MOBA's. Smite is a MOBA like no other, and you should show it off. People don't know that the minions will punch your face in. There's a great video showing people how SMITE has very subtle, but overwhelming differences than League or Dota. Not everyone will see that video, so possibly make one of your own. It will truly help the game overall. I love this game and can't bare to see it be hidden.

At the moment, the current system is flawed and needs changing. No one wants to play on a server that is across the world from them. This is my constructive criticism of the game, and explaining that this needs changing.

Sorry if you were expecting a full item guide for tanks, but this is not the case as I'm bad at that, this is mostly a code-of-conduct for tanks and (some) items useful overall.

This idea came up after reading some posts of people that aren't left with anything to play but tank, well this is for those people or those that play dedicatedly TANK.

Anyways, I will list here what I think tanks should do...

*1) Tanks are important for ANY team composition, no matter what, teams with no tank are gonna have a hard time in teamfights.

*2) If you're going to tank, be dang CORAGEOUS, grow a Norse beard and TANK LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.

*3) As a tank, your priorities are NOT to get kills yourself, but to HELP your team setting them up

*4) You must protect your carry at all costs or until he manages to get away

*5) When you build tank, keep in mind your tank's strengths and weaknesses: for instance, Vulcan has no real ""escape"", so expect to be caught in the middle of teamfights all the time, so for advice, BUY PLATED GREAVES, WALL OF ABSOLUTION and I found a really good idea to buy Creeping Curse, as coupled with the Thumper, people have a hard time getting away from it.

**Other useful items are ALWAYS Mark of the Vanguard, Sovereignty, Magi's Blessing, Bulwark of Hope, and one I really love, MIDGARDIAN MAIL... and if you're not getting Reinforced Greaves, try to leave a spot open for Hide of the Leviathan**

*6) Most tanks have CC and craploads of armor, if you have to body block, DO SO, if your carry is getting chased down, USE THE CC TO STOP THE ENEMIES... most of the time all that effort is thanked.

*7) (this taken from Allied's guide on Odin) You rotate wherever the AD carry rotates in lane, in other words, chase him down.

*8) When teamfights start going on, you're EXPECTED to take the brunt of the force as it is your JOB as a tank.

*9) This.. I can't get enough of this one because I love how it sounds... you're a TANK, you're THE FIRST ONE INTO A FIGHT AND THE LAST ONE TO LEAVE, you can't chicken out mid-fight and leave teammates behind to die, if YOU die but helped set up amazing plays, you know you did your job right.

*10) Tanks should NOT be afraid to be solo laners, they're the best ones for that role hands down, followed by bruisers. This DOES mean though that you should WARD THE JUNGLE, that way you'll help both your jungler and yourself. 

*edit: Let me explain this one as there seems to be lots of confusion going on around it: When you're solo, you gain experience and gold that should otherwise be shared with your lane partner, and since that one is going to be jungling, he's getting all that experience through ganks and buff camps, HENCE, you'll (a lot of times) overlevel the opposing lane and become harder to take down. Also, you're not trying to get kills, OR trying to push. You push the lane when your jungler/mid/any other teammate helps you zone out the opponents, OR when you KNOW YOUR ENEMIES ARE BACK IN THEIR BASES AFTER RECALLING

*11) Actives are always helpful but I find the best one is by far Purification Beads, more so than Aegis.

edit: 

*12) TANK TOWERS IF YOU CAN, don't wait on minions, a tank is a tank and as such is supposed to get hit by things of both small and great damage and come out alive or try to do so (most of the time at least). (thank you Treius for this one, I missed it)


That concludes my ""guide"". If it gets downvoted to hell then so be it, but I got that off my mind. Hope it helps people understand more of the tank role and why it is important, and *saving people always gives a sense of damn great satisfaction*.

GG!

1361641401.0,57,self.Smite,1934zp,Suggested Change for Hades,Booman61,65,8,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1934zp/suggested_change_for_hades/,"When playing Hades, you generally look for a big cluster of enemy players and minions standing together to dive into, applying Blight and hitting them with Devour Souls for maximum damage. Of course the more enemy units you cover in Blight and hit with the nuke, the more explosions you'll trigger, thus the more damage you'll put out.

The problem with this comes in mid/late game. It is encouraged to level up Devour Souls first, as it is the main source of damage, healing and wave-clearing available to Hades. After this, it would be desirable to level up Death from Below, as it deals pretty good damage at higher levels and needless to say would benefit Hades' damage output significantly.

However I find myself reluctant to put points into Death from Below until last, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. This dash sets up Hades' nuke combo perfectly, but then ceases to work late game as the dash will kill the minions instantly, leaving no blighted enemies to bomb. So Hades is unintentionally losing damage as he levels up.

How to fix this? I would suggest altering the Blight mechanic slightly. So imagine you have a minion standing here, and Hades dashes into him with the intention of applying Blight. This dash is leveled up and proceeds to kill the minion. Now imagine that instead of disappearing (despite the minion being dead), this Blight lingers around on the ground for the rest of its duration (remembering that Hades' Passive makes Blight lasts 5 seconds when applied). Like when Neith kills an enemy god, a Broken Weave drops in the dead god's place. I think it would be good for Hades' Blight to linger around in the same manner until its total 5 second duration has been served.

This way, Hades will actually be rewarded, instead of punished, for upgrading his abilities. Also to clarify, this wouldn't just apply to the dash, I'm using it as an example. Another scenario would be Hades auto-attacking a few enemy minions to apply Blight, but then 2 seconds later your Wukong lane partner clears the whole wave with his Overhand Smash. Normally your Blight would be wasted, but with this suggested change, you would still have another 3 seconds to use the lingering Blight on the ground before its total 5 second duration has run out.

TL;DR - Any application of Blight should not disappear with the death of an enemy unit, and instead should linger until either consumed by Hades' abilities or its 5 second duration has expired.

I'm of course talking about gods like Tyr and Anhur. There's no excuse for gods like them to have two damaging skills that chain into each other due to hard CC and leave the victim stunned at the end so they can land additional auto attacks.

Take Anubis for example, his stun allows him to combo into his skills. That's great! Why? Cause the stun itself doesn't do a crap ton of damage. You can beads out of it and hope to live.

For the two previously mentioned gods. Even if you use beads you still just took a ton of damage and will probably still die from their follow up attack. 

Long story short, don't make brusiers tanks with a crap ton of damage (Odin and Tyr.)

Yes, we were gone for awhile but we are re-launching a 24/5 Stream starting tomorrow August 5th at 12AM EST.

We will also be hosting a 2 day Charity stream on August 8th - August 9th Starting at 12AM EST ending Saturday Morning (Thursday and Friday)  to raise funds for Autism. We already have the donation link so you guys can donate up to the day of the stream and even past it! 

Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/smitefire

Donations: http://events.autismspeaks.org/tributes/smitefiretv


Also a bit of information on why we choose Autism Speaks for this charity event. 

I myself am affected by Autism, my little brother was born with this disorder. He was told to be a moderate case, but it was still very hard as I was the one watching him most of the time. His behavior was different from others of his age group, speech was delayed and being able to use his words instead of his teeth, hands, or feet was a problem. Through much therapy and learning about this disorder him and our family were able to help out and give him the attention needed. So this charity event means a lot and I appreciate everyone that helps support, donate, or even spread the word of Autism, so we can also end the bullying of the special needs children. 

Fact : 1.6% of the world have Autism.
 60% of the world are gamers. 
About one out of every 88 children in the United States currently has autism.

**Succubus Aphrodite**

This is a skin for Aphrodite. This skin comes with a skin, and small animation reworks.

**Skin Description:**

Aphrodite engulges in the dark side of beauty as a Succubus. She shows she dark side by dressing in a black and purple corset, skirt, and leather boots. Her hair is black and long, and flows with the wind. She wears black lipstick along with dark, sharp mascara and long, black nails. To top it all off, she now has devilish red eyes.

**Customized Aesthetics:**

To embrace the darkness, she has a set of black, bat wings and a silver staff with bat wings parting at the top, harnessing her dark magic.

**Basic Attcks**

Her basic attacks are altered to have a dark purple effect.

**Love Birds**

Her birds are now Vampire bats. Harming enemies and healing her soul mate.

**Kiss**

Her kiss is altered to have a dark purple effect. (along with the link)

**Back Off!**

Back off is altered to have a dark purple effect.

**Undying Love**

Undying love is altered to have a dark purple effect.


**Shiru's Note**

That's all there is for this skin, of course this COULD be made into an epic skin with some changes, but its just not needed. I feel like skin is a must have for Aphro as it fits into her character so perfectly, being the goddess of beauty.

I suggest some changes go to gods like the ones i mentioned. i have a few ideas, and tried to keep them related to the god and bring them to the level of more recent gods.

**Bastet**: Maybe giving her a bonus combo, much like ne zha and now isis, would make her on par with other assassins.

her passive is laughable at best. I feel like it is a big reason she doesnt get much attention in both competetive and casual play.


**Zeus**: I feel like making his AAs travel 25%-40% faster would be a neat little addition, not game breaking, and works as lightning really should travel faster than a ball of water, fire or wind.

He really does not have a true passive, Overcharge is crucial to his other abilities, yes, but feels like something is missing. 


**Hades**: A small solution was to make enemies killed with blight leave a small mark (like neiths weaves) on the ground for a few seconds, still being able to be detonated.

someone has mentioned this before, His passive is great early game, and if you get a whole lane, gives amazing healing. but late game when a dash will clear some minions, it feels almost better to not level his dash at all to maximize the healing. 


This is just my thoughts, some other gods might need a little buff as well, what are some suggestions you guys have thought of?

~~ **Disclaimer:** Running this program may result in a ban, since it is a third party program that modifies game files. BUT I have contacted HiRez about it and [Here](http://i.imgur.com/R1S39lW.jpg) is the email response I got. TL;DR you should not get banned for this as it is not a blacklisted program. Of course use at your own risk though. 

.

So there have been lot's of people uploading custom Smite Launcher skins recently, and I saw some people wanting a way to have them randomly change each time you run the launcher, so I made a little program to do that.

It was made with AutoHotKey, but as far as I understand you do not need that program to run it.

Also personally my smite skins folder doesn't need administrative permission to edit, so I don't know if it will work for everyone who has it installed to their C:\ drive, you might just have to run it with administrative permission.

If you have any problems getting it to work let me know, I'll try to fix it.

If your skins file isn't in the default place, go the to config.txt in there and change the first line to the correct skins location. Also the second line in there is the update time (in minutes), so by default it will switch the background every 5 minutes.

### Anyways, here is the download [link](http://www.mediafire.com/download/d6pam292oddgcrh/Smite_Launcher_Background_Switcher.zip).

If everything works right, you just have to run the Switcher.exe.

EDIT: Just realized there is a glitch, if the picture file name comes alphabetically after ""config.txt"" it won't be in the mix. For the time being just rename it, I may fix this later.

One of the main reasons for this is the 3v3 Joust and Arena game modes.  I've been able to recruit around seven (!) of my former WoW arena teammates to join Smite, and many of them have been completely hooked- been playing nonstop.

One of the main reasons for this incredible popularity is that there is a huge community of ex-WoW Arena players that simply have no other game to play right now.  WoW Arena has fallen off since TBC/WotLK, and now is pretty much dead.  Forge isn't the same.  The most logical progression for many players is LoL (LoL pro Vileroze was also a top Arena player), but it just doesn't ""feel"" right.  GW2 didn't ""feel"" right.  Smite does, mostly due to the skilled nature of the 3rd person camera and skillshot-centric gameplay.

I implore HiRez and the rest of the community, please support ranked 3v3/5v5 Arena.  Balance for it, feature it, what have you.  There is a massive MMO PvP community that just doesn't have a good arena game right now, and Smite can offer them that.

Hello Smiters,

Besides the Balance and visual overhaul patch that is happening tomorrow and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFnAB8fwXYzK1yaxkQEpYhSwn0v5bh0eneQ6V9o8TI0/pub), the flairs on /r/Smite received a small update.

##Pantheon Flairs
Every pantheon now has its own flair. These are based off of the in-game flags you see when selecting a god. 

An image with all of them can be found [here](http://puu.sh/41si3.png) and their respective order is Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Hindu, Mayan, Norse, Roman.

##Ao Kuang and Xbalanque flairs
The flair names of Ao Kuang and Xbalanque have been renamed (aok -&gt; aokuang | xbla -&gt; xbalanque), which should not be noticable since it is only back-end, however, this caused both flairs to dissappear. If you had either of those as a flair please reselect them and you're good to go. Apologies for the inconvenience.

##Artemis flair
Artemis received her new picture snapshot instead of the outdated one.

##\#RememberTheManticore
Due to high request we decided to also implement a Manticore flair. He will always be in our minds!

This flair can be selected just as any other one, by looking to the right of here and clicking the ""(edit)"" button to the right of your own name.

*In case you are not familiar with thise joke/memory, it's a long running gag on /r/Smite. In Practice Joust, you used to fight against a monster called the Manticore rather than the current Ra. He had a different skillset and a different model. He was bugged as hell (he could recall while walking, and his ability cooldowns were rather.. anarchistic), but people still loved him for the fact that he was something mysterious, as he could not be found anywhere else in Smite. When Hirez removed him, people were saddened to see that Ra took his place instead, and vouched for the Manticore's return. Hirez noted that he will possibly eventually reappear in the game, but they did not say he would return as a playable character. Recent datamining lead us to the discovery he will most likely just be a piece of the scenery, as a non-interactable NPC, while most people would rather see him as a new buff camp monster, a boss, an opponent, or a playable character.*

##Wiki News
Acces to the wiki editing was bugged, but should be fixed now. We are unsure if this is still the case, and we'd like to receive feedback on this.

Currently you require 50 combined (link, post, or a sum of those) karma gained on /r/Smite and an account age of 30 days to be able to edit the wiki.

Seeing as the wiki is really unorganized and we basically have to start blank, there will be a vanity reward for major wiki contributors and early birds as soon as the wiki is of decent proportions and contains a fair bit of resource and information!

It's a promising item with good stats, yet I never see anyone purchase it. Why? Consistency.

The biggest problem with Magi's is how wildly inconsistent it is with the treatment of abilities. The way it blocks things that we feel it shouldn't, or doesn't block things that it should. Then there are times where it just acts weird in general, like where Freya's Banish will not only go through the blessing, but *also* clear it as well? Yeah. It's weird.

So, in a nutshell, Krett and I went through and did all the testing for you. Every ability, every situation, every technicality we could think of. Will it ever dethrone Bulwark as the primary go-to magical defence item? Probably not. Though, with this, hopefully we could see this item used just a bit more often.

* -- The admin granted a regame and allowed the substitution of Pixard.
* -- Pixard entered the game playing Ra and rotated another player (Lawbster) onto Anhur.
* -- The game was played and Bipolar Method killed the enemy's minotaur, winning the game.
* -- The admin team reviewed the game and realized the BM had breached the rules, specifically providing for substitutions : *Substitute Players are available to be used (subbed) between re-games. However, God selection/bans MUST be the same with the subbed Player, who must use the same God of the player that was rotated out. Any substitutions during a re-game MUST be approved by an Administrator.*
* -- The game was decided to have been forfeit by BM.

Since the release of the Devil Skin skin for Cupid, HiRez started to not only change the looks of a god, but also the looks of the ability. Yay! Pretty cool stuff. Recolored/remodeled abilities are badass. If you aren't exactly sure what I am talking about, have an example, such as Freya's Frost Maiden abilities or Ymir's new Cacodemon abilities (heck, the reskin is the reason why everybody wants to play Ymir again, all of a sudden! [Just. Look at it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Hb0yPm-Pg)) 

So yeah. Awesomesauce for the new reskins. But, aren't we forgetting something? What about the skins (and I'm especially talking about the 300+ Gem skins, not the recolouring skins) that came before this whole happening? Why does my Obsidian Shard Ymir not create a huge dark wall instead of a lump of ice? And how come my Gravehound Anubis breathes the exact same as the default one?
To clarify: Why not give the ""old"" skins a little patchup, too, and give them custom abilities aswell? I know it can be a bit of work, but sometimes it isn't too hard. Just a different colour scheme is already cool. Altough, sometimes it may be a little harder, just a colour scheme change can do the job. 

The other issue is with specific gods that have a ""cheap"" skin (200 Gems / 11000 Favour), such as Agni's Incinerator or Hades' Blood-thingy. It is just awful to see Hades with red particles and then using purple abilities. Same counts for Sobek's Death Dealer, Ra's Alienware, and many more. Just imagine how cool the Alienware ult would look: I be firin' mah lazooor!

When I bought the Blood Eagle skin for Thor after seeing the little ad in-game, I expected the skills to be recoloured to a more blue-ish scheme (if you look at the little trailer, you will know what I mean). You can imagine my face after I found out it was not the case. Sad panda. So I figured I could make a suggestion. If lots of other peeps out there agree, we might get some petition done, or at least send some emails to anyone working at HiRez Studios. Who knows.

1) I've changed the spawn areas to help prevent an exploit. I apologize for this escaping notice before release &lt;3


2) Work has been done around lighting and textures in the lane, to hopefully make it less confusing/bright yellow on some monitors.


3) I've done a pass to try and help people who run on lower-end machines. I can't guarantee that this will improve frame rate for everyone, but I'm trying.


4) THE BIG ONE: There's been a lot of call to have some underlying code work put in to make the game mode be a bit less ""random,"" and ensure some loops in the mode: ie, if there is a tank on one team the other team should also have a tank, etc. While this DOES take a way from the ""All Random"" aspect of the game mode, I'm interested to see if/how people are willing to deviate from tradition and put something in place to help this issue. Thoughts?

**EDIT** so after reading some forum threads and feedback, another discussion I can bring up is having some sort of code to keep it so that you don't get the same god you just played. What are thoughts on that? I don't know how doable it is, but that also seems to be an issue folks are having.

I know I heard it somewhere else and it could quite possibly on this subreddit. So if you said this first, you deserve all the credit.


Anyway the idea goes like this: Smite has 5 (-roman) pantheons. Right now, the Arena of the Gods is very heavily Greek themed. Why not have a different Arena theme for each pantheon? Imagine a snow-swept, mountainous Norseland of an Arena. Replace the minions with vikings. Replace the fire giant with a frost dragon, and the volcano with a huge icy mountain. Ideas could be worked out for all the other pantheons, but that is the one which comes to mind easiest. (Damn, the Egyptian Arena would be sexy).


As for which arena could go into, it could be decided by the majority of the gods in the match. For example, if 4 out of the 10 gods in a given match are Greek (and all the others are less than 4), then it would go to the Greek arena. This isn't perfect because then the pantheons with less gods would naturally be chosen less, but it is a first thought idea. 
Anyway, food for thought. Let me know what you think?",,False,,t5_2stl8,1348498258.0,,agni,True,t3_10e6pk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/10e6pk/an_idea_which_could_bring_some_aesthetic_variety/,

1) Clans/Legions/Guilds - these would be your social groups. they would have unlimited size (or maybe a very large limit like 100). these, like in MMORPGs would be there for players in the same guild or clan to meet up, hang out, chat and be able to form groups in order to play together much more easily. These Clans/Legions/Guilds can be given a name but this name will NOT be displayed in the match itself. However on the stat pages you would see the Clan/Legion/Guild name.


2) Teams - These would be used for the competitive scene, these would be the clans as they are now. Limited to 9 players and they would show the name or abbreviation of the Team


As a player you would be able to join 1 Team and one ""Social Group"" (aka Clan/Legion/Guild).


so for example I am a part of a fairly large Clan/Guild. Since they have quite a few people that play casually, what they have done is create multiple ""teams"" in order to facilitate the Guild function of MMORPGs (where they are originally from). however it doesn't work very well since you can only have 9 people in your team. Since they have 30+ players that play every new player has to put quite a few names on their friends list.


now while it works it would be nice to just click on the guild or ""social group"" tab and see everyone who is online at the moment. instead of ""do i have you on my friends list? what is your ingame name, is it the same as it is in &lt;insert VOIP&gt; or do you spell it differently"" and all that other good stuff.

&gt;Noxious Fumes duration reduced to 5s.  (To prevent Gem of Isolation from controlling areas near objectives for 10s)
&gt;Path of Flames damage increased by 10% scaling.  Path Duration reverted back to 4s.  
&gt;Meteor damage decreased 15% scaling, and 10 damage per rank.  
Passive now applies on Path of Flames.

The goal here is allow Agni to get a bit more use out of Path of Flames, as it's only currently used to secure or escape.  This allows Agni to be a bit more aggressive; rewarding him for using PoF offensively.


**Anhur:**
&gt;Desert Fury:  Now reads damage as:  65/95/125/155/185

This will make his death sentence of an ult a bit more manageable early game, and a tad more useful endgame.  The rest of his kit is fun, damaging, and is in a great place.


**Anubis:**
&gt;Plague of Locusts:  Damage reduced by 10 at all levels.  Anubis can now move during Plague of Locusts, and will not incur a backward movement penalty during.  If the final tick hits, the enemy is slowed by 30% for 3s.  
&gt;Death Gaze:  Will also now reduce damage taken by 30% for the duration.


**Ao Kuang:**
&gt;Passive increased to 10%.

The goal here is to make him a tad more bursty.  This should also make Book of Thoth (Which is still slightly overlooked) a more appealing option.  Coupled with Gem, and a few other mana/hp items, should make Ethereal popular on this character as well.

**Aphrodite:**
&gt;Loving Embrace increased to 45%.

The 15% increase should make it more viable for aphro to get blue, to allow left lane to sustain longer, or to make invasions on right more appealing.  Couple this with someone who loses mana quickly, and the major effectiveness of meditation, Aphro will be become an onslaught in lane.  Ymir has a large stun area, while she only has the option to stun one, and has very limited escape mechanics when linked.


**Apollo:**
&gt;The Moves:  Damage reduced at all level 1 by 10.  Scaling reduced to 50%
&gt;Across the Sky:  First 2 seconds of riding are free.  Subsequent seconds are now 65 mana.
Serenade:  protections given are reduced to 10/15/20/25/30

Apollos damage right now is a tad too high.  His passive, and So Beautiful make him insanely bursty, and with the recent buff to Serenade, he's become very tank.  A lot of people have overlooked the fairly insane damage that The Moves puts out.  As of now, it's been a pretty brain dead decision to level the ult last, so by allowing the moves to be a tad bit weaker, and buffing the ult cost, the builds might not be so cookie cutter.  This will also encourage more ganking.

Serenade has made him far too tanky, coupled with two escapes, a mesmerize, and protection buffs.  The protections have been nerfed to encourage him to not kill everything he sees for free.



**Arachne:**
&gt;Cocoon:  The web shot can now be used  to latch onto walls and enemies alike.  When holding the mouse button down, it will pull you to the wall or enemy.  Upon press, it will pull the enemy to you. (Obviously doesn't work on walls.)

This change does a few things!  First off, Arachne now has a real escape mechanic.  Something she has been dying for since release.  But, that will also allow her to gank more, and much faster, using that 30s cooldown to move around the map freely, and far more easily, the ganks and jungling become a much more realistic thing.  (Thanks to the reddit users who posted this idea!)


**Ares:**
&gt;Shackles:  Duration reduced from 4s to 2.5.  May now apply four.

This does two great things for Ares!  First, it increases the skill of the character.  If you hit two shackles before, you could last them up to 7.9~ seconds, which did close to absurd damage.  No, it did absurd damage.  What's beyond absurd.  It did that.  But now, you're going to have to be smarter with the shackles.  Applying 1-2-1-2, instead of 1-2-1 allow him to be a tad more dangerous, but he must be quicker, and more accurate to get the full damage off.

Overall, the damage gets decreased single target, but he gains a bit more control, especially in teamfights!


**Artemis:**
&gt;Calydonian Boar: Stun is now 1.5 seconds at all levels.  Boar health now scales with leveling as well. 300/600/900/1200/1500

The boar is great early, and now it will be better.  But late game, it will shine like a thousand stars, as letting roam free will no longer be an option.  Teams will have to coordinate to be able to get that boar controlled, while Artemis has the chance to use taps more effectively during major fights.


**Bacchus:**
&gt;Drunk-o-meter:  Now empties 15% faster.
&gt;Chug:  Mana cost now scales: 40/60/80/100/120.  Meter increased by 20/25/30/35/40.  Protections increased 20/25/30/35/40
&gt;Belly Flop.  Animation made slower, adding 12 frames (.2 seconds) until the landing animation.  Must be smashed to apply slow.

This forces a more mana intensive Bacchus.  By reducing the costs of Chug, but increasing the rate at which the meter empties,  Bacchus will be forced to have to make decisions between popping chug before a fight, or keeping the mana to use for abilities.  Chug will be more vital in his gameplay than it was before, making it a more appealing choice when leveling.


**Bakasura:**
&gt;Eat Minion:  Protection buff is now 8s.  Minions eaten are no longer lost upon death.  Minions may be eaten from allied team.

Regurgitate will now be a tad more viable with minions not being lost.  The now 8s buff will also allow Baka to eat from lane and join teamfights in jungle with a tad more survivability.  Giving him the option to eat his own minions, be it Roman or one of his spawned minions increases his survivability greatly, with a heal and protection buff. (Gold awarded to enemy team as if the creep died to the enemy team's creeps.)


**Bastet:**
&gt;Nine Lives changed to Leader of the Pack:  15% physical Power Buff for each spawned Cat alive.  When all die, she enrages, gaining a 30% Damage Reduction Buff for 5s.
&gt;Cat Call:  Spawned cats now take 66% less damage from God Abilities.  Hand of the Gods functions as normal.  Damage now 20/30/40/50/60.  Cats no long despawn when Bastet is killed.

Stop dying!  These changes will allow Bastet's ult to be a more prominent feature of how she's payed.  The protection buff and damage buff will completely change how pounce is used in team fights, and the damage reduction on the cats will force Bastet to get her hands dirty.  Luckily, the cats now take reduced damage, so to stop Bastet's onslaught of damage reduction, power boots, and cc immunity, you're gonna need to get those cats down.


**Cupid:**
&gt;Share the Love:  Mana regained when allies pick up hearts now scales with cost.  Two hearts worth the cost of placing.
&gt;Flutter:  Attack speed buff increased to 5/15/25/35/45.
&gt;Fields of Love:  Slow reduced to 25%

The change to Share the Love ensures that you're not always going to choose to level flutter.  Flutter's attack speed buff will now play well with his passive.

But, it won't be free.  Fields of Love is a tad too controlling the way it is, so while the passive will see more use, people will have to really work with their lane partners to ensure the stun or mesmerize off of fields of love!


**Fenrir:**
&gt;Ragnarok:  At full runes, he gains a 25% movement speed increase for 4s.  No protections gained.

The protection buff initially was designed to save him, using the ult as more of an escape mechanic, or allowing him to dive a bit more freely.  Most of the time, the runes were saved for insane healing, a stun, or splash damage.  This movement speed increase will allow him to have a better escape, or a better initiate.  It will only last 4s though, to not allow fenrir to pull people farther than he really should be able.


**Freya:**
&gt;Brisingamen's Blessing:  Conversion increased to 33%.
&gt;Valkyrie's Discretion:  Base damage reduced to 100/130/160/190/210

The idea here, is to lean away from the nigh-on full magical Freya we've seen control everything, and allow her to have more of a hybrid role.  Items like Qin's Blades, Executioner and more will see more of a varying playstyle in Freya.


**Guan Yu:**
&gt;Tranquil Gift:  Healing Increased to 60/90/120/150/180 + 40 % of your magical power.  (Up from 30%.)
&gt;Tactician's Advantage:  Magical Scaling decreased from 25% to 20% 

Guan's 1 is generally used as a last resort, more than a bait that the other healers can abuse.  This should increase Guan's early game presence, and ensure hit late game healing can be closer to support.  TA had a slight damage nerf, to put him in line with other supports as well.


**Hades:**
&gt;Blight: 1, 2, 3 will now apply Blight if it isn't already present. to allow for stronger combinations of abilities.  Enemies that take basic attack damage from hades when blighted will be slowed by 10%.  Duration increased to 6s.

This gives hades more freedom of application and use of Blight.  Slows from attacks, slows from dashes, all allow Hades to have better control of his lane, keeping it safe for his partner. This also allows hades to set up kill opportunities for himself in midlane much, much easier.


**He Bo:**
&gt;Water Cannon's Scaling reduced to 75%.  (Down from 90.)

It does too much damage. Come on.


**Hel:**
&gt;Cleanse:  Cleanse now functions at frame 6, to account for latency.
&gt;Hinder:  Slow now 10/15/20/25/30.

This makes the 2 a more attractive option early game, to lean her more towards slight support, and a tiny bit away from pure damage.  The cleanse buff will ensure almost always that it properly actives, due to the small duration of the immunity.


**Hercules:**
&gt;Due to recent changes to the character, more testing will be needed before changes should be made.


**Kali:**  
&gt;Enrage:  The 25% lifesteal will now activate upon reaching 50% HP, as opposed to 25.  

This will allow her to sustain for a bit longer in major team fights.  Generally, if Kali reaches 25%, she's either about to die, or is going to be retreating.  Either way, not a good way to utilize the passive.  As it stands, the passive is only useful in a 1v1 or 1v2 scenario, when no CC is available to the enemy team.


**Loki:**
&gt;Decoy:  Enemies in the area of Decoy will incur a 10% movement penalty.  Enemies who take damage from decoy will have a 3s 25% slow applied to them.

Loki can only kill one person at a time.  Little CC in a game full of hard CC is a death sentence.  This Small buff to his least used move for team fights should allow Loki a bit more freedom in both chasing and escaping.


**Ne Zha:**
&gt;Due to recent changes, further exploration of the character is needed before judgment can be made.


**Neith:**
&gt;Broken Weave:  Weaves can now be seen from 25 feet farther.
&gt;Unravel:  Diameter reduced by 15%.


**Odin:**
&gt;Lunge:  Now reduced protections of enemies who are hit by Lunge by 5/10/15/20/25 for 4s.

Odin's jump is the only jump that doesn't have an added effect.  This jump passive would make blink less of a viable choice, and encourage him to use jump as an offensive move, especially later in the game.  As it stands, most people use Lunge to escape, or plainly to initiate for the ult.  This change will enforce a slightly more thoughtful Odin, to maximize the damage.


**Poseidon:**
&gt;No changes!  Poseidon is in a great spot right now.


**Ra:**
&gt;Celestial Beam:  The beam now has the ability to ""double tap,"" based on enemy movement and hitbox placement.

Ra's damage has been very low as of late, and offers little besides the heal.  His presence has been weakened singe the change, and this should revert him back to an extremely viable mid mage.


**Sobek:**
&gt;No Changes!  Sobek is in a great place.


**Sun Wukong:**
&gt;Somersault:  Damage increased to:  70/110/150/190/230 + 80% scaling.  (Up from 70%)

A small increase in damage should help Wukong's fading early game.  Early in the game's lifespan, Wukong's damage was far above anyone else's, and the amazing CC from Year of the Monkey was unmatched.  Since his nerfs, and the addition of over a dozen gods with brilliant CC, Monkey needed a small boost in damage!


**Thor:**
NO CHANGES!  ODIN BORE *MANY CHILDREN!*


**Vamana:**
&gt;Colossal Fury:  Healing per second reverted back to 5%.  Movement speed increased when giant by 25%.

Big Baby needs to get in there and get things done.  With the extra healing, Baby can jump in to the fight and really control the way things go, like other supports/tanks/bruisers have been able to!  To the same end, the movement speed will allow his ult to do damage outside of those cluster**** team fights.  Chasing is important with baby.  His kit is generally applied to be a chaser.  The frisbee toss is a slow, an AOE cone damage, and the baby dash, he needs a way to stay in the fight.


**Vulcan:**
&gt;Volcanic Overdrive:  Using Volcanic Overdrive will cause Thumper and Inferno Cannon's cooldowns to be refreshed.

Nothing sucks more than popping your ~~xfactor~~ Volcanic Overdrive, right as your turrets die.  This will ensure his Ultimate is never wasted, and increase his control!


**Xbalanque:**
I honestly can not come up with anything that won't just inherently break this character.  Changes to anything, no matter hwo slight, could turn him from slightly below the top Phys Carries, to far, far beyond, due to his scaling, and branching bolas.  SORRY!


**Ymir**
&gt;Glacial Strike:  Now actives in a wave.  Frame 6 at the start of his feet, to frame 36 at the tip.  4 hit boxes.
&gt;Shards of Ice:  SoI can now be canceled at any point for 1/4th the damage.  (Does not increase with time, unless the full duration is met.

This will given Ymir a real option for fighting in a 1v1 scenario, and should increase his damage with his basic attacks even more!  As it stands, it's mroe of a compliment to freeze than it is any real threat on it's own.  This should make it more beneficial to level early, and in major damage lanes, could even pass freeze at certain levels.

The SoI change again works with the passive, applying frostbite if activated early, Ymir can chase with more attacks for extra damage.

**Zeus:**
&gt;Overcharge:  Three stacks now electrocute an enemy, reducing an enemy's magical protection by 20, and do 10+10% of your magical power per second as long as three stacks persist.
&gt;Aegis Shiled:  Reduces CC duration by 30% while active.

Zeus's passive is plain.  Like, milk plain.  So, I spruced it up.  I want him to constantly be doing damage, instead of waiting on detonate.  This makes a lot of things more attractive.  Fatalis/Frostbound hammer late game to keep stacks up and slow to wait on detonate?  Gem of Isolation second to keep people in the ult and keep stacks up as long as possible?  Yum.

Zeus' real issue lies in escapes.  So a simple CC reduction of 30% on Aegis would allow him a bit more freedom of movement.  Thanks to the buff on the ult, he can afford to build a bit more tanky with maybe early Voidstone/WoA and stay in the fray a bit longer!

Hello everyone! I went through and took all the data from Day 1 of the monthly finals today to see what was being the most contested and what was having the most success. (Will also update this for tomorrow's data)

Day 1 : http://imgur.com/YowXFAF

Day 1 + 2 : http://imgur.com/FsqiBtK

While we don't have the largest sample size and it isn't the most accurate data as to how powerful everyone actually is, this does give us a good idea of which gods are being heavily contested during the picking and banning stages. So now a couple of notes :

1. Currently teams are favoring a heavy tank style of play. Gods like Bacchus/Hercules/Sobek/Vamana/Ymir/Guan were all huge picks that teams were getting. Ra who can also be considered 'tanky' was also hugely sought after. Another common strain is that these tanks have a lot of CC, generally more than 1 form. Tanks are currently dominant.

2. Hel fell out of favor hard. With one patch she went from a must have to not even worth fighting over.

3. Ranged AD seems to not only have fallen out of favor, but is a liability. In a current Tank/CC heavy meta Artemis wasn't picked once, Anhur lost every time, and the only Ranged AD that was picked consistantly was Xbalanque.

4. Currently Wukong/Thor/Hercules/Vamana are the Melee Carries of choice. Kali/Bastet/Baka/Arachne were not picked once, and for similar reasons as the AD ranged. Wukong/Thor/Hercules/Vamana all bring good CC/Disruption/And Tankiness while Baka/Bastet/Arachne/Kali are all build squishy and bring little to no CC to the table. (Edit: Vamana/Herc are more tanks but they do provide a significant portion of Physical Damage as well)

5. Agni/Ra are pretty much the only two mids atm. While Ao/Anubis were also picked, this was likely due to Agni/Ra being unavailable due to picks and bans or to work into very specific comps. While Ao/Anubis can definitely hold mid Agni brings lots of fast AoE and CC while Ra bring lots of fast AoE and Sustain. In other words, these picks are more for later team fights than because they are currently so dominate mid there is no other choice.

These are just some of the things I noticed from collecting the data and participating in the tournament. If anyone has questions about the graph or wants to discuss my points/add onto them I am gonna be checking this thread a lot. This is a good chance to get a discussion going :)

I gave her a guitar and bass as weapons since I couldn't think of any other instrument that would be suitable for a punk rocker that imitates her scythes.  Maybe someone else has a better idea?

###Jörmungandr, Midgard Serpent
----
* *Passive:* **Godslay Venom** - Jörmungandr's auto-attacks apply a debilitating poison, slowing foes.  Capped at [X] stacks, Jörmungandr's damaging abilities will supercharge the venom and explode it for [Y] damage per-stack. (Non-scaling slow, additional stacks does not increase slow.)

* *1:* **Ouroboros Wheel** - Coiling into the shape of an Ouroboros, Jörmungandr rolls forward at intense speeds gaining [X] movement speed, he tail slams the first enemy god he comes in contact with stunning and dealing [Y] damage.  Jörmungandr, knocks away deals [Y] damage minions in his path while under the effects of Ouroboros Wheel. (Fixed-duration stun.) 

* *2:* **Poison Peel** - 

&gt;&gt; * Passive: Jörmungandr covers himself with his venom, gaining additional [X] protections and applies of his venom to anyone who strikes him in melee. 

&gt;&gt; * Active: Jörmungandr sheds his peel, gaining additional movement speed, and damaging foes behind him with his venom.  Applies [Y] stacks of Godslay Venom.

* *3:* **Molt Puppet** - Jörmungandr molts and animates his discarded skin.  Any crowd control effects are removed and his dead skin now attacks the nearest enemy god for [X] seconds.  If it is killed or it's duration is up, it will explode applying [Y] stacks of his venom.  (His molted skin has a reduced version of Jörmungandr's current stats,)

* *4:* **God Eater** - Jörmungandr dives deep into the earth and explodes out of target location, entrapping an enemy god for [X] seconds constricting them for [Y] true damage, and knocking all other enemy gods away.  If a god dies under this effect Jörmungandr eats them, gaining additional protections for a period.

The event itself was drawing a lot of attention to the Smite booth and I talked to countless new players who loved the game, as well as people who have been following the scene and were excited to meet the streamers and pros.

The showmatch of us (SNIPE) vs. Dignitas was a blast. The hype for both teams was nearly even and the first two matches reflected how intense competitive smite matches can be. Sure there were some little technical issues that disrupted the set, but I still felt that our showmatch did exactly that, it showcased the feel and energy of high level Smite competition.

&gt;
&gt;That said, we do feel like the jungler role is a bit too strong at this point and we will be making some changes to it in the next patch to reduce it's influence on the game. Jungle/Roam will still be viable but we are still interested in making it either optional or at least more supportive for lane play.
&gt;
&gt;A few other small changes are coming to the map including making the side lanes a bit wider at certain areas and some improvements to the FoW.
&gt;
&gt;We are also interested in making mid lane a bit more important and may increase the gold value of those towers.
&gt;
&gt;Bumba's mask will also be revised to work with some of the jungle changes in the next patch.
&gt;
&gt;Lastly, thanks for the support. Smite is growing well and we continue to have new player records almost every day.

**And also:**

&gt;Over time we plan to move each God to one damage [magical damage or physical damage] type to make it simpler to understand and allows us to create more interesting items to support those builds.

&gt;Gold Denial:  You no longer get gold from minions that have taken damage from your tower.

This is AMAZING.  The game takes forever in its current state.  With this change it will do two things:  1)  Demands more aggression in lane, whilst 2)  putting pressure on the jungler.  

Aggression in lane means that people will be forced to fight more.  The passivity you've all been complaining about will be out the window, as gold denial will take precedance.  This will also take away from the overall late game team comp, and bring us back to the golden age of laning when having duo comps will be paramount.  Anhur/Ymir, Sobek/...anything, Fenrir/Aphro or Anhur, Freya/Ares.  There are a ton of fun comps.  This will also, after some short theory work, bring Arachne back to the lane.  (You'll have to tune into the stream tomorrow to see this.)

The Jungler's role will be scary now!  Because of the aggression, but less EXP if sharing due to the bumba's change, he/she will be forced to roam faster, putting an even bigger emphasis on speed buff.  Missed opportunities are going to hurt the jungler a lot, so expect less overall ganks opportunities, as falling behind is no longer an option.  There will be little room to make it up.

&gt;The ""Gold Fury Lane!:""  The space in between the tier 1 towers have been increased.  

It's all but guaranteed that this is where you'll see the duo go.  The extra room is designed to ensure that the two sets of opponents are fighting for creep pushes, and the extra room will be used to create lane freezes as defense.  

Wards. Wards. Wards.  Last hitting is gonna be very important to gain the biggest lead possible.  And watch your map!  If you see the enemy jungler in the opposite lane or in mid, start pushing hard and go for the denial.  Hand of the gods will probably help here, too, to stop from being denied too much. 

Watchers will be necessary on supports it feels in the duo.

Mana/Cooldown Camps:  The four corner camps will now have buffs that provide both Mana Regen and Cooldown Reduction.  A'la League's Blue buff.

A great change for right lane.  Cooldown was useless until 15-17 minutes generally, as you plainly risked OOMing too soon.  The extra MP regen should prove very useful.  I expect this was to ensure the duo lane on GF side would always have the option for blue. This means less fighting about who goes where.

**Items:**

&gt;Heartseeker/DoomOrb:  You now gain 2 stacks for god kills.;  On death, the item loses half its stacks.

Expect both items to start making a come back.  Especially HS, which was already on it's way in.  We've seen it a lot, and now with the major buff to stack loss, you can expect that with the movement speed attached, this will be the go to item for junglers.  Possibly boots1&gt;HS, for quicker stack gain.  Maybe even forgoing boots until HS is finished altogether.  Will need testing.  Movement is very, very important.

Doom Orb will have a major benefit on characters who can push quickly and safely like Ao and Ra.  Now those characters who were susceptible to ganks, will have less to worry about on death.

&gt;Shard: Tier 3 - Restoration Shard
Using this item gives you a health and mana heal equal to 4% of your maximum health and mana, plus an additional 4% per charge. Charges are gained when an enemy god uses an ability within 80 feet. Max. 9 charges. Cooldown - 120s.

&gt;Tier 3 - Static Shard
Using this item gives yourself a shield that reflects 2% of damage done to you back to the attacker, plus an additional 2% per charge for 6 seconds. Charges are gained when an enemy god uses an ability within 80 feet. Max. 9 charges. Cooldown - 120s.


Restoration really isn't all that different than Meditation.  Less mana, more HP gain.  Ultimately, won't change things too much.

Shard, on the other hand, has pretty huge potential.  High HP characters will restoration can act as sponges to casters and assassins, and then Regen.  Characters like Chronos and Baby who can get HP back very, very quickly can use this to help dish out damage.  Since Kali has built in CC immunity, this probably wouldn't be too terrible, as she can also heal up a bit.  Her high burst coupled with a 20% reflect on all damage could be pretty scary.  Obviously will need testing.

&gt;The Voids!:  Nurphed

Little to talk about here.  Slight nerfs to both items.  Better passive's for single players, as the aura doesn't restrict you to a certain length, but the overall usage of the items have been toned down.  This is a good fix, as these items were core on too many gods in almost any scenario.

Defense and pure damage is a dangerous, dangerous combination.  With that, we saw it on every single caster or Melee, including some tanks.  Pretty crazy.  Now, a bit more thought will go into when these items are purchased.  Maybe.  We'll see!


&gt;Shield:  This is a new 3 tier item with 2 top tier branches

Runic Shield is more important, in my opinion!  The idea of giving Physical Damage and Magical Protection at the same time is very, very dangerous.  It's something HiRez has leaned away from for awhile in fear of making Melee or Ranged too strong.  This is going to be a core defensive item, unless after major testing it shows bulwark being stronger due to HP.  Either way, there is a lot of potential! 

&gt;Gem of Binding:  New Gem tier 3:  Enemies hit by your basic attacks will move 25% slower for 2 seconds.

This is a HUGE pickup for characters like Vulcan, Ymir, and Sobek, who will gain amazing CC potential and HP.  Expect this going into late game, or the later stages of mid game.  On magical in-hansd, might come even sooner.  Freya will have slows permanently, Chronos's chases will be much more rewarding as well!

This is a very scary item.  Coupled with Poly, In hands are gonna be a very dangerous thing.  Expect much more aggressive mid-laners tomorrow!


&gt;Bumba's mask:  The full XP reward bonus for not getting the last hit has been removed.  You still get the full gold reward bonus when not getting the last hit.  

See the Map changes for laning to see my opinion how to approach the new Bumba's.

&gt;Teleport/ShieldedTele:  Teleport has been reduced in price by half, but may now only target towers.  Shielded Tele can target allied wards or allied towers.

A hefty price tag to go not very far, expect this to bee seen less throughout the game.  Shielded Tele has a lot more uses now, given that pushes will be more common in laning.  This will be a good pickup for Solo laner and Jungler to make more aggressive teams have to fall back.

&gt;Nemian Lion (As per twitter posts from Bart/Chris:)  Damage reflect changed to 30% to 20%

This will start to fall off greatly, as a result.  If the cost doesn't reflect, expect to see this item hit the bench in favor of Sov and Mark, permanently.

**Gods**

&gt;Ares:  Voidstone got nerfed.  

This hurts an already weak character. :(  No theorycrafting, just sad.  Flames of our Fathers.  :(:(:(

&gt;Isis:  Ouch.

Ult got smacked with the nerfbat.  Less Objective control due to damage reduction getting nerfed and longer cooldown.  Overall, sitll very, very powerful.  Damage is still insanely high.  Expect her to still be picked/banned a lot.  Puts her in line with Pos a bit more, though, which is a great thing.

&gt;Vulcan: Nightmare.

Forcing turret behavior is something players have wanted for a long time.  This could be massive, as he could place a turret in team fights backfire to mark someone, and force them to either take a massive chunk of their health or escape into a position that can amazingly advantageous for your team.  An extra 10% doesn't hurt!!  Solo vulcan will be pretty awesome, as he's super tanky, has a fair escape, and can push so safely!

But you guys want to make it even more viable. You figured tweaking the mask would help, but it doesn't. We still don't like it.

Edit: I get it, wards exist. But let's look at the matchmaking. When I solo que I usually go against a 2/3que that involves a jungler. My team usually gets unlucky and everyone's a solo. We can't suddenly become as quardinated as the enemy, have a jungler to counter jungle, then all ward when the enemy team can sucessfuly counter ward. I can't type ""go ward, they just dropped mine"" mid combat. Plus this SMITE map I fell in love with isn't suited for jungling. I'm not going to quit a game over one item.

If anything, it will promote more communication for the whole team because people will see you using it, and because you're amazing they'll be awed by your ability and want to replicate you. If you really feel you need to call specific characters, try something like VF1 (Enemy Missing Left) *god name*. 



Most importantly perhaps, is that the command is then read out for your whole team to hear. This means when you type VF1, not only does the message ""Enemy Missing Left"" pop up in the chat window, but your character also reads it out for your whole team to hear. This makes it amazing for pubs because you're able to still focus like you would while in vent/teamspeak/mumble/skype while being in a game with randoms. Pretty incredible imo



Depending on how terrible my formatting is, here is the VGS commands for those who are curious about it.

Simply Press V to start the sequence, then one of the following **Bold** Letters followed by a number/letter



**V**

&gt; **A** (attack)

    1 (left) - ""Attack Left Lane!""
    2 (middle) - ""AttackMiddle Lane!""
    3 (right) - ""Attack Right Lane!""



&gt; **D** (defend)

    1 (left) - ""Defend Left Lane!""
    2 (middle) - ""Defend Middle Lane!""
    3 (right) - ""Defend Right Lane!""      
      


&gt; **G** (gank)

    1 (left) - ""Gank Left Lane!""
    2 (middle) - ""Gank Middle Lane!""
    3 (right) - ""Gank Right Lane!""       
      


&gt; **F** (MIA)

    1 (left) - ""Enemy missing left!""
    2 (middle) - ""Enemy missing middle!""
    3 (right) - ""Enemy missing right!""  
      


&gt; **R** (retreat)

    1 (left) - ""Retreat left lane!""
    2 (middle) - ""Retreat middle lane!""
    3 (right) - ""Retreat right lane!""   
      


&gt; **E** (emote)

    J (joke) - &lt;plays joke&gt;
    L (laugh) - &lt;plays laugh&gt;
    T (taunt) - &lt;plays taunt&gt;
      


&gt; **T** (returned)

    1 (left) - ""Enemies have returned left!""
    2 (middle) - ""Enemies have returned middle!""
    3 (right) - ""Enemies have returned right!"" 
      


&gt; **I** (incoming)

    1 (left) - ""Enemies incoming left!""
    2 (middle) - ""Enemies incoming middle!""
    3 (right) - ""Enemies incoming right!"" 
      


&gt; **V** (other)

    H (help!)
      
    B (Be right back!)

    K (Steping away for a moment.)

    G (Nice Job!)

    T (Thanks!)

    O (Ok!)

    C (Cancel that!)

    Y (Yes!)

    N (No!)




Following this we can see how easy it is to not only give out a lot of specific information, but also how fast it is. With no command taking more than 3 key strokes, this is something everyone needs to utilize on a regular basis and try to promote others using.



&gt; Just a note raised by RaymondDash and a very valid one at that. This system will be next to useless for you if you're on a VOIP program while gaming. However, please keep in mind that even if there is 1 person in the game that is not talking with you guys, this will keep him in the loop and keep him informed. This is a system you want to become second nature if you solo queue a lot or only have a small group of friends to queue with (2 or 3 per group).

I though let's make again a list of things, which changed but weren't in the patch notes. Like always some minor things, things which haven't been finalized yet are already changed. 

*If you have an undocumented change, please share it (changes are faster noticed when people play their favorite god) and I will add it to the list for visibility. We can only find them all together and you notice for instance changes quicker to your favorite god, etc. Or changes to specific skins, god cards, etc.*

###Launcher splash art

*A reminder by Zaap005*

The game launcher for Smite also now has the updated Thor image. 

### Username and password typing sound

*Thanks to the good hearing of Geletin*

This sound is now changed and is less noisy (just listen for your self XD)

###No god cons

*Found by gruntmaster1*

The god tooltips don't have cons anymore.

###Fog of war in joust

Joust has now fog of war like Conquest. 

###Jungle practice mode (MAJOR ONE!!!)

Jungle practice has its art overhaul (maybe partly yet). Splash art didn't get updated for it, so I first overlooked it as not changed...

[Pictures](http://imgur.com/yWbyYIN,G5rQXvl,K3NWQ7x,F854I2C,D1AbCZc,N27L2qK,sTyjJCt)

The art style is now again in line with the new conquest map art style and features the new base, camps, gold fury, etc. 

###Arachne golden skin

*Thanks to Apoctis*

Arachne now has golden spiders on her gold skin

###Health and mana pots

*Thanks to OblivionKnight92*

The mana and health pots have again swapped places in the item store...

*Also Aegis (and other actives) are also switched places. Thanks to shadowpenguin29*

###Exp bar on top in the lobby

*Thanks to AeromaaX*

It's now completely filled after some complaints. 

###Minimize button 

*Found by JoeXL*

The minimize button has been added again when using borderless window mode.

###Teleport consumable

*Found by ExplosionNois*

The Teleport interface has been improved and towers now pop (maybe also for wards with active, confirmation needed though) when hovered over them. 

###Frostmaiden skin (Freya)

*Found by AeromaaX*

Freya's Frost Maiden skin has updated fx to match the previous Freya fx updates too. Her ult now also makes icy spikes appear up from the ground when shooting.

****

*This is just, because hubble-microscope datamined these pictures and because it's not much wanted to make a complete new post for it. So for anyone who is interested in it...*

Once again from NXeSports here bringing you an interview with Psiyo from SKGaming, with co-host WristyUK. First and for most, this video comes with an apology as the interview was done about a week ago, and given some hardware issues that I am still unable to solve have uploaded an interview without gameplay footage. The editing of the interview got delayed because of this.

My sincere apologies to Psiyo, the SKGaming team and Wristy. 
Interview link will be available after processing:

Furthermore, as the saying goes ""when it rains it pours"". Hardware issues not withstanding I have more sad news in my relation with the community.

Officially announcing that I'm leaving the Smite community and also eSports in general. Something personal and of professional nature has come up that will unable me to dedicate my effort, time and energy to keep the podcast going and quality. As I was looking forward to new content and improving the way it was being displayed. It is actually a life changing opportunity. 

My sincere thanks to HiRez for making such a beautiful game, the growing and embracing community and all my previous interviewees that have graced me with their time and energy. Wish my leave would be on better conditions (i.e. A better quality video).

Worrying about one person ganking wasnt enough so get ready to start worrying about two at a time.  Bumbas mask concretes the fact junglers receive no penalty when it comes to sharing experience so the ""assistant jungler"" roams the jungle with him while obtaining 66% of the total experience.  Well thats not too bad most would say, the ""assistant jungler"" should fall behind in level over time.  Sadly this is not the case...counter jungling, copious amounts of ganking, and the sheer amount of jungle camps allows them to not only sustain levels but instead they out-level most lanes in the game.  Solo lanes are in every lane and need only survive there for a short amount of time before their duo jungle comes out of the woodwork to devour his lane opponents.  I love jungling, I WANT it to be in the game but since its glorious introduction to this game ive seen repetitive God selection, reliance on single players, and of course the introduction to the most boring thing in the game...2v1 lanes.  Please understand Hi-Rez that the more you attempt to make multiple options viable the worse the meta gets.  Within days the community will find the best lane combinations and decide whether a jungler is more or less beneficial than the other.  If you want versatility focus on the items and Gods because at some point your going to have to decide on which meta to design the game around.  One thing I can absolutely admit to is that before the jungler was introduced I could play ANY lane and have a wonderful time.  Now I search for my jubilant adventures in either mid lane or jungle.

***Short Summary***: *This post is about helping new players by the teachings of experienced players so the community also improves and people are not driven away. This could be done from tomorrow on with the All-Chat function that'll be added to Challenge matches and just sheer good-will and experienced players posting IGN so new ones can add and learn gameplay and etiquette. Thank you.*

**THIS is the most important part of it**

Hello everyone, I'm writing this post because of the rising number of new posts on the reddit that I see with words like or relating to ""noob questions"", ""new to the game"", or the various questions regarding the basics of the game.

Anyways, there are (I think) more players than we are actually aware of trying out Smite for the first time each day, joining the MOBA communities for the first time or in the early stages of the game, frequently being paired with players that are levels too high for them to tackle at their current state, and that just destroy them and (in some cases and regrettably) drive them out of Smite, which just makes the Smite community fall short and the game not grow.

I think we should do something about that.

I've read, heard and discussed that **Smite has one of the best communities of players over the rest of MOBAs, at least when compared to League of Legends and Heroes of Newerth (never heard of a comparison with the DotA community), even when just being in Beta**. That being said, I think we should take advantage of that and help out the new players that are just trying to improve so we keep it that way.

Also, this is a shout out to all people that make smurf accounts, **IF YOU'RE GONNA SMURF, PLEASE HELP OUT NEW PLAYERS**. I'd hate to see people leave Smite and the community because they can't take on people that are smurfing and just beat them senseless everytime they play or that make it seem like they just suck at playing a certain God and demotivate them. This can be changed though, in the incoming patch, all CHALLENGE matches will have an option available for ""All-Chat"", this is one of the solutions. Why? Because I think it'd be a great idea if some people (if it's considered a good idea I'll make it public, if not, PM me for the IGN) that are in the higher levels could help out. Personally I'm a level 30, and I could post my in-game-name here so new players that want to can add me and play Joust Challenges or Conquest Challenges so they can learn, not just from me, but from everyone that wants to teach them. 
And not just teach gameplay, but etiquette too, such as not flaming, not DCing, no AFKing, no BULLYING, etc, because even though right now AFKing is not punished by more than 30 minutes of a penalty, it makes a whole team have to adjust itself to the lost-teammember and sometimes deal with constant rants, flames and bullying... let's face it, everyone of us started at Level 1 and a really big number of us started as a feeder and got flamed by the whole team.


I love the game and I'd hate for the community to eat itself up, or to keep on seeing bad-natured players out there that for whatever reason, don't help with this.

(**Tip: TrendKiLLv01 has uploaded -as to date- three beginner guides for new smite players, and as they're helpful and full of useful information, I think the real-time experience can help with that too, I'll post some links at the end... along with a video that explains it, people can IN GAME help explain the VGS for example**).

Last but not least, some people talk about the game dying because the competitive scene is low... HOW can you expect it to grow if there are constant flamers, trolls, AFKers, or just bad natured players out there that (if not punished directly by Hi-Rez) aren't punished or taught by more experienced players... keeping silent never helps against flaming. Those people really drive people out of the community and make it toxic, which is why the competitive scene doesn't grow, it doesn't have much to do with the game being in Beta stages (just watch streams by PonPon, Allied, Anatoliy, Lassiz, Zapman, Shing, etc... personally I'd love to join the competitive scene to play with them).

PLEA! let them configure the jungle, and jungling, before you go on your witch hunt... 

Edit 1: thank you all for keeping the comment section in a nice tone

I am currently getting matched up with players like Allied, Hero, SK-members and so on. So I am finally feeling confident with putting some content up and talk more deeply about the game. So what do you guys feel that we are missing? It feels like there is already guides on how to play gods and what items to get and e.t.c. So I have a couple of ideas on what I could make:
1: Casting. I feel like our community have a lack of casters. And I would love to take a step in that direction.
2: Items vs Items. So this would be a relativly short video where I would talk about two items that have something in common, and when you should pick one over the other. For example: souleater vs gloves, or magi blessing vs Bulkware of Hope.
3: Patchday show. This is where I would talk about whats new and how It's going to affect the game.

So In the end, I want to do some content for you guys who have played Smite for a while and wants to learn the ""advanced basics"" and such. I also want to help Smite grow bigger, and create some good spectator-content for you guys. But how do you feel? What do you want? What is bad, what is good?

More skill shots seem to be instant cast and have wider AOE. Like how can you even miss a Chang'e ult. You can beads it but still take damage or aegis it and be forced to stand still which was the point of the ult in the first place. Compare that to a Ra or Ao Kuang ult which can be dodged, aegis'd , or just plane mistimed be the one using it. Along with that , the newer gods can move while they use abilities. Take isis or chronos who can simply run a person down while using abilities. Agni and he bo need to stand still to use the meteor and water spout respectively. And then you have Athena's taunt which like ymirs frost breath, is a cone, but with Athena you can simply dash to your target, with Ymir you have to bait it or wall someone in both of which are harder to accomplish. I'm just worried that smite becomes less about skill shots which is what brought me to the game in the first place.

Sadly this post will have a huge ass text of wall and bad grammar (Sorry for that). I have a shit ton experience about how to DDoS (I am not saying that I am the guy who is DDoSing smite scene (Yeah that joke from Zapman about me was funny, but not anymore &lt;3)), how to prevent it and how to stop it.

Current most popular methods to get your IP are from **Skype** (Anyone can get your IP from skype even without adding you to contacts or call to you. All you need to know is skype username), **IRC chats** (yes twitch.tv uses IRC channel, but you can't get IP from there, because usernames are not unmaskable), **Mumble**, **Ventrillo**, **TeamSpeak**, **Raidcall** (You do not even need to be an admin on those to get someone's IP. Thank god it requires to have some kind of a skill to actually get the IP. To stop it you have to add proxy to them or use VPN), and **Tinychat** (Not even going to explain how people can get IP from it but it is hard as shit). Those are the most popular programs where your IP can be leaked. 

To stop people getting your IP from Skype there are few methods:

**A)** Proxy for Skype

Good explained tutorial on how to do it: http://imgur.com/a/NpFdW


**B)** VPN (Virtual Private Network)

VPN will work but it also affects your gameplay and anything else you do with your internet. Yes some VPN's has settings where you can just choose on where you want to use VPN, but also those are not free. So I am not really going to explain how to do it, since I believe you really do not want to pay for something that can be prevented for free.


**C)** Log in to skype via Microsoft/Facebook accounts

**---REMOVED--- because after new skype update which happened few hours ago, it doesn't work anymore (Thank you Skype, really appreciate your work).**


**D)** IMO.IM (http://imo.im)

This is a simple website which will allow you to use skype through their servers. Basically you go to that website, click on skype and enter your skype username with the password. Once someone will try to get your ip from your skype username they will get some IP which is registered with Amazon servers. There's still 2 downsides with it: 1. Web Based skype 2. Skype calls won't have the best quality. IMO is pretty trustful, been using it for a while and everything is totally fine.


So, basically currently these are the methods your IP can be gotten from: 90% it's Skype; 8% Public Mumble, Ventrillo, TeamSpeak, or Raidcall servers; 2% public IRC chats. 


**ALSO** Do not forget to change your IP once you either add proxy to skype, use VPN, or IMO. Because DDoSer still knows your real IP, and if you won't change your IP he can basically just target your real IP.

P.S. Once again sorry for the bad grammar. English is my 2nd language &lt;3

I am currently an 28ish level ex-smite player. Haven't played for a couple months, though I still watch the excellent twitch stream daily. Why did you quit, you may ask. Well that's because of the incessant harassment by players ranging from can't-play-the-game-worth-a-damn to professional smite players. There are a couple major problems I'd like to point out.

- Most people can only have fun the 50% +/- of the time they are winning. As soon as fellow players start dying they drag others down into their pits of pessimism.

- This has been covered but YELLING AT PEOPLE FOR NOT CALLING MISSING does not help any better then asking ""call mia next time mid, thanks"" Maybe think about if you overextended too much (unless you didn't). Also just because I called enemies incoming from mid or side lane DOES NOT GUARANTEE I'm going to follow them to your lane, so don't get mad about it!

- Complaining that someone misses a skill shot, or accidentally causes you to die. Humans make mistakes, or have bad days. Give people advice and tips instead of insulting them for how bad they are, EVEN IF THEY ARE TERRIBLE. Encourage, don't instigate. I've heard a lot of people counter this point with ""Well noobs don't listen to my advice"". Personally I can't tell you if this is true or not, but every single tip and trick another respectful player has given me I have used.

- Group harassment mentality… has only happened a few times but when it does, you feel like absolute crap. My connection dropped so I was late to the game, now I am shit on for the entire game…. Don't participate in this kind of behavior. If anything I'd love to see more players STANDING UP FOR OTHERS when they're being harassed. Not sitting idly by while someone with human emotions gets shit on by another player. If we stand against the trolls and ragers together we could drive some out of the game!

Now this is my first moba, I realize that these problems are inherent (unfortunately) to all known moba games. However I am not bad at this game! My win percentage is over 55%…. I play a decent carry, and an above average support (where I shine). YES there is a time investment element and snowball effect that cause people to rage at slightest hint of a ""feeder"", YES your anger is ""justifiable"" on occasion, and YES apparently there are ""more"" toxic communities then Smite. But do we want to be a better community or the best?

Sorry for the all the ranting. I know simply complaining doesn't change the game but my hope is people will start refusing to sit by and let rages pick on others. If there are any likeminded individuals who want to:

- Play with people that can have fun even when losing

- Never complain or blame others

- Always respectful to everyone unless picking on a friend as a joke

- Always positive and optimistic, even when frustrated

- Reacts to stressful situations with humor, not anger

- Doesn't stick to one role the entire time (carry instalockers I'm looking at YOU)

Then get in touch with me… I'd be honored to battle beside you and pick up Smite once again!

TLDR: There are people on the other end of the internet, you don't know what kind of effect you have on them or what kind of terrible life/day they had. We all deserve a chance to play this wonderful game without harassment. Stand up for others!! We can give Smite the community it needs if we all help. &lt;3

* *1st* - Can I play **every** Position in current meta? ....Well if you don't know what the meta is **YOU SHOULD** that means ask around maybe watch some *streams/tournaments* as of right now (08-29-12) The current smite meta-game is a Tank left with a jungler, a high mobility champ mid, and a double CC lane Right... 

* *2nd*   **Learn how to use and** **BUY** [HAND OF THE GODS](http://smitedb.com/ability/hand-of-the-gods/) **at the beginning of every game**.. doesn't matter your position, build, or god...FUCKING BUY IT....until its nurfed.

* *3rd* **Do not auto lock a god at champ select**...(*This will change with bans and draft picks but for now*) **do not call a position** simply ask if you can...It will usually get you what you want. 

* *4th* If you are struggling in lane aka Getting Stomped...**Ask for help** and don't blame your team for your bad play...don't say (ie ""NO HELP MID THAT'S WHY I'M GETTING CRUSHED"") just before you are to far behind just ask for help....stop and type for 1 fucking second that way you can't only blame yourself...the map is huge we don't know if your doing well or poorly....speak up...we are reading!!!!

* *5th* If your build isn't working don't be stubborn build something else next game....or **find a pro/really good player and ask them what they are building**....for instance a player in my bracket was building Bakasura wrong every game we played so if he was on the opposing team we won...on my team we lost....I politely mentioned to him that this is the build that I use....guess what...he is crushing this game now....and every game since that I have played with him...

* *6th* If someone is doing poorly...**help them** do not ~~flame them~~ it helps no one...**IT HELPS....NO ONE**!!!! if they are feeding ask them to play safer...if they are RAMBOING every fucking thing ask them if they could stick to the team and or go to them and force them into team play.......

* *7th* My most important point....remember this is a Moba...and In moba's its mostly a numbers game....**try and back out of any lopsided engagements** (ie a 2v4...or a 4v5 or if they have FG) you only want to **fight advantageous engagements** ie if you have 3 and they have 2.....you have fg and they have a man down.. or best of all if they have no ults and you do....

* 
For example Ares is marked as High CC and Low Damage. But he actually does quite a lot of damage.

Hitting Ares chains perfectly having full AP build will do more damage than Ao Kung's ult. That's a lot of damage.

*Besides his ult, only his chains offer CC and they are hard to hit, not like Ymir's freeze, Hades fear, even sobek/anubis wrap/grab. High CC is not something, IMO, would use to describe him.*

I guess I can concede that he does have good/high CC, up to 8s of slow/cripple on a single target. (4s for multiple ones)

* Artemis should have a Con as Low Mobility the only ADC without a dash/leap, (yeah her 2 gives her speed, but comparatively she has low mobility)

I would give Anubis/Arachne a ""Low mobility"" as a con, considering their peers have some sort of mobility.

* Bastet has 2 cons: Low CC, and Low Defense. 
But Kali is the only god to have absolutely no CC. And bastet has 2 forms of CC. While Baka has 1 form of CC. Why kali no has ""Low CC""?
 
* Hades, Guan Yu, Ares, Vulcan are described as Tank's. But I would refer to them as magical bruisers. I always build more AP items on them than say Sobek/Bacchus/Ymir/... Some times you mage Hade's mid and use your ult on less ambitious targets so you don't suicide.

It says Hades is support. but his heal is hard to control (to heal others like Guan Yu) and his CC is weaker than say bacchus or ymir. Hade's isn't much more of a support than Ymir/Bacchus IMO. But Ymir and Bacchus don't have support listed?

Vulcan is described as a pusher, but hades can have similar clear speed. Ao Kuang is a pusher, but Posiden isn't?

* And of course Tyr is marked as low damage. When he actually does quite a bit of damage. His #1 damage is between Thor's spin to win and Fenrir's brutalize your face off.

Vamana is described as low damage. But vamana has actually quite high burst and hitting his ult right can do shit tons of damage. But maybe with his CD's he has low damage overall.

Odin is given ""Low Damage"" but that is not something I would discribe him as. Against an anubis, he does like half Anubis HP with 2 moves at level 2. How is that ""low damage""? 

* And Freya I would discribe as a Ranged/Melee Magical, not just Melee, most people use her as ranged, and only on occasion use her melee autos.

* Since it seems like Junglers are in the game now, I would add the ""Jungler"" role to gods. Some none standard junglers I'd include: Anubis?, Hebo, Athena. Athena and hebo have shown to be successful junglers even Posiden. But for example its been shown that artemis is not a good jungler.

As far as I saw only Arachne was mentioned as a Jungler, but other gods got great jungling capabilities. 

* Thor is described as a bruiser. But I think he is also an assassin being able to ult from nowhere. Most people use thor to jungle and build him high damage.

If Arachne doesn't get super fed you have to build her bruiser/tank late game to survive team fights.

* Lastly I think another role to consider is solo lane or ""Solo"".

After the tech and presentation issues from Day 2, plenty of you may have found yourselves shaking your head at us. This post will hopefully ease *some* troubled minds and provide insight into our attendance at RTX.

&gt;

Ultimately, our intention was to [deepen our relationships with content creators](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BOgPgLTCAAAO6A-.png) while [showcasing Smite to some new audiences](http://www.twitch.tv/smitegame/c/2547126) (CAUTION: Extremely Harsh Language &amp; Blaring Audio). Our stated goals were realized; however, that is not the end of the story.

&gt;

While having these connections and new players for Hi-Rez is beyond significant, the community team is just as interested in getting their expertise directly to you on a regular basis. Within the next few weeks, you will get content from The Creatures and other industry folks that explains how to build an audience for you and your gaming communities. This is not going to be generic information. It will be catered to the Smite community as much as possible while emphasizing key areas of gaming media content creation.

&gt;

Of course, we would love for your content to be as Smite-centric as possible, but you get to choose what you do with the information they deliver. We are really looking forward to partnering with the community to continue branching out into new realms of content creation!

The matches were all entertaining to watch on the stream with commentary provided by Drybear and Squiddish. The level of play was also higher than I expected as well, especially considering teams were composed of five individuals who may not have ever heard of each other before, let alone played together.

   I wanted to enter myself, however sign ups filled up near instantly and I didn't have a chance. Which goes without saying how successful this tourney was. This tourney provides an introduction players who have no team to the competitive scene.


   The coordination and synergy some of the teams had, especially the winning team, Godzilla (lol) was absolutely fantastic, and I do hope those five consider playing more together and possibly even entering into the competitive scene together. 


   Overall, I highly enjoyed from a watcher's perspective, and plan on trying to participate in two weeks next time sign ups are open. It's a very healthy event to promote the competitive scene, and I'm for it. My only criticism, and this is somewhat of a joke, but allow teams to come up with their own names. At first I was laughing too hard at every team being named after a Godzilla monster. Eventually I rolled with it but hey, five people may form a bond of unity and play better should they agree on a name. So, I'm going to shut up now and end with this:

once again...

Today i want to ask you guys if you would like if hirez would add more competition in the competition.


What i mean by that is for example giving MVP votes for matches/tourneys for EU/NA 



Make allstar matches monthly EU vs. NA  (i know the ping difference sucks but w/e)
(zapman think's too early :(  )



For promotion i would like it if hirez would allow players / people from the community that create good content (wristy uk shoutcaster or inuki for making awesome content with high producion value) since at the tournament streams there are alot of viewers and it would help (my opinion) to frow the community and the competetive scene in SMITE!

1375730609.0,37,self.Smite,1jrc4i,A brief introduction to /r/Smite | Beginner's guide,CtrlAltDefeated,64,27,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1jrc4i/a_brief_introduction_to_rsmite_beginners_guide/,"Welcome to /r/Smite!

If you are new here, you may have a few questions, mostly regarding the flairs and how general stuff works here. Due to Hirez migrating to Reddit as their official community resource this guide might be useful for the flows of new people.

##What is /r/Smite and what are those other subreddits?
/r/Smite is a community-created environment for people to talk about nearly anything that is /r/Smite related. Even though we are not officially affiliated with Hirez, posts by Hirez staff may appear every once in a while. They are not suppported by us and we are not supported by them, but they are as welcome as any other visitor, of course.

Posts may contain nearly everything, however, there are a few exceptions. Memes/Macros are prohibited here to prevent karma whoring. We have created a small branch reddit for those posts: /r/Gank. If you're looking for a team, group, or one member to fill a team, please take a look at /r/SmiteLFM. If you like to suggest a god concept, you're welcome to post one here. If you desire to have elaborate and lots of feedback on it, we recommend checking out the independent /r/SmiteGodConcepts, where the mods will review each suggestion and give their commentary.

In case you feel like meeting other people who play smite and talking to them through voice chat, there is an official Smite Mumble server. More info can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1ivw5t/smite_community_mumble/).

##What is that cool tag behind people's names?
You may see people have a picture of a god or team logo behind their name, with a little custom text behind it. This is free for everyone and can be selected by clicking the ""(edit)"" button behind your name in the sidebar. Currently we are slightly behind on updating god flairs, but this will be fixed soon. Chronos, Chang'e, and Hun Batz are unavailable as of right now. The top 5 teams from NA/EU combined are slightly outdated as well, this will also be patched. Hirez employees and /r/Smite mods have special flair. They are a Hirez logo and a Bumba's mask respectively.

##How does my post get a subject tag?
As you browse on the subreddit you may notice the coloured tags in front of most post titles. This is post flair, which is manually assigned by the mods. If you have submitted a post, you will not have flair attached to it. Don't worry about it, as it will be there as soon as any of the mods has some free time to assign all posts a flair if they haven't one yet. The meanings of the flairs speak for themselves, of course.

##My post does not appear?
What happens if you submit a post and it's not showing up in the ""NEW"" tab after roughly 3 minutes? Well, it has most likely been caught in Reddit's automatic spam filter. It's far from perfect, and it may remove the wrong posts on accident. Nothing is lost though, just send us a moderator mail and we'll fix your post right away. Do not try to resubmit the same post, however, as it will most likely be removed as well and only make you more susceptible to post removal (the Reddit algorithm checks the likelihood of you being a spammer by looking at how many posts of you have been removed in the past).

##Err, the wiki seems to be abandoned.
The wiki is now open for editing! You will require 50 karma gained on this subreddit and an account age of 30 days in order to contribute.

##I have a question or suggestion for the mods of /r/Smite, /r/Gank or /r/SmiteLFM !
If you have constructive criticism or questions about the subreddit itself don't hesitate to send us a modmail through /r/Smite! In this way it is guaranteed at least one of the moderators will read your message. You are free to make meta-suggestions in selfposts here, but we cannot assure you that it will be read or responded to, as posts may be lost or missed by us.

##Whats up with these ""official"" subreddits
As of today, 5th of august 2013, Hirez announced they will no longer be maintaining their official forums but switch to Reddit instead. Patch notes are moved to /r/SmitePatch, and bug reports to /r/SmiteBug. /r/OfficialSmite seems to be private as I write this, but this may change soon. Patch notes will also be posted here on this subreddit by either Bart or one of the mods. Those three reddits are officially maintained by Hirez enployees, and not by the community.

Once again, if you have any questions/inquiries, feel free to send us a moderator mail, which can be done by blicking the big red button at the end of the sidebar.

**Enjoy your time!**

Fog of war however restricts your foreward vision by a ton. So much in fact that I would say that in the jungle right now you have much less vision than you would in dota or league because you're no longer compensating by seeing far in front of you.

To me at least fog of war makes the game look worse, makes people play more passively (nobody wants to go out in the jungle when they cant see) and is just an unnecessary addition that was adopted just because other MOBAS have it (similar to how jungling was reintroduced)

anyone else think it should go? or am I wrong?


EDIT: some other things that IRK me about fog of war.

1. The way its implemented right now means that if im in lane looking into the jungle, I can see far, but once I step inside I lose all the vision I had, very disorientating.

2. When leaving the jungle the fog of war effects stays for a second in the lanes, also disorientating.

Be careful what you wish for:

A year ago the devs played with the idea of ""offerings"" to be placed on ""shrines,"" which from what I gathered at the time was very similar to League of Legends' Rune Page system. 

For those of you unfamiliar: It's an out of game stat customization system. You would buy offerings with favor, and offerings had small stat boosts (I'm talking tiny, like +1 PP, etc) they could give to your god. Each God got one ""Shrine"" free, and you could buy two more. You placed the offerings on the shrines for each god, and that god would have its stats boosted by some small amount in game depending on what offerings were on the shrine equipped. These offerings last forever once bought.

Back then, (again, this was a year ago) they canceled the idea, I imagine because at the time it seemed like a needless timesink for a game so early in beta. For whatever reason, I can't find anything about them on the forums anywhere, but there's a video from forever ago where you can see them in game ""under construction""

[Here it is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Utkl5iCdo)

I honestly would like them back, although I see how they were cautious about it, seeing as how grindy the League of Legends version is (A full ""rune page"" in LOL costs about as much as three new champions in favor)

I know a lot of people are against them, and as such this isn't a ""Hey, let's curry some support for this""

I'm actually saying be careful what you ask for, I haven't seen one person mention these yet but I've seen three threads begging for a new thing to burn favor on. I have a strong feeling this will be what they offer.

Edit: Please don't downvote because you disagree with the concept, that's bad reddiquette, upvote so this is seen, I get no karma for it and people need to know.

**Edit #2: TheHotShot1 claims before the threads were auto-deleted that devs renegged on the favor costs, saying if they ever implemented such a system everyone would have full access to it on day 1, and a few people have confirmed his story to me.**

 * These are the problems with the current solo lane with some suggestions to fix it. Maybe it will help, maybe not :x Notice i didn't go too specifically into character balance, just more of general problems.

 1v1 lane has no trading blows, usually turns into a farm lane.

Here is the current ""Metagame"" in the solo lane. 

Mark of Vanguard - Mystical Mark - Reinforced Boots - More tank stuff

Meditation 3
Blink, Creeping Curse or something else as your 2nd active

The problem is there is no real ""trades"" that happen. There are matchups but however most of the 1v1 lanes happen between Guan Yu, Sobek and Odin vs each other. Each of these characters and many others are too tanky naturally (especially with some tank items) to even bother fighting with. 

If you end up 1v1ing usually both players start extremely Tanky and build into more Tanky items. After a certain point there is no trading what so ever, it turns into a complete farmfest making it undesirable to play for most. Especially with meditation(heals 40% of missing health, ya cool) the sustain is unbearable in lane and almost impossible to commit 100% to force them to back or kill them without jungler help. 

Possible solutions- Nerf tank items 

* Tank items are too strong to stack, it is also why the ""tank meta"" was such a problem when Hirez increased the global Gold per second. Overall tank items need to be toned down imo (i'm a competitive support player saying this too, no bias yo). 

Example. Hide of the Nemean Lion - 2250gold	 +80 Physical Protection	 +200 Health Passive - PASSIVE - Reflects 30% of all basic attack damage back to the attacker as magical damage.

Rushing this item alone, automatically puts the ranged AD carry at a huge disadvantage until they get lifesteal and extra damage to properly deal with it. Which is quite common in the solo lane to rush, this and mystical mark. This is just one example.

* Characters overall ""tank stats"" need to be toned down.

 Like Odin for example. No reason he should be so naturally tanky its absolutely absurd. At max rank Odin's Gungir's might gives 60 physical protection naturally, 20 hp5, does a AOE slow for 25% AND does 310 physical damage with 100% scaling. That is just 1 ability.

This is just 1 of the many tanks problems on top of doing pretty good damage and have insane utility. 


Ok i think that is it. Just some things i wanted to point out, feel free to add anything in comments. Just some gripes i had with solo lane. It doesn't feel like its a skill matchup, just feels like it is a farm lane and i don't really have to do anything except wait for my jungler  but not because jungling is **overpowered** but more of solo lane bruisers / tanks are **too tanky / strong**.

I think it's time for the inherited terms from LoL to be disestablish, such as ad carry and ap carry.

Let Smite's terminology be built on the game itself. For the feeling of independence!

Don't you others also feel it's time?
-

- ad (attack damage) carry is now pp (physical power) carry. Reasoning: Firstly, in Smite there is no attack damage stat. The most similair stat is physical power. 
Secondly, in LoL, attack damage increases your auto attack damage. In Smite physical power increases both basic attack damage and ability damage. This means gods such and Anhur or Hun Batz would fit with both terms ad and ap carry, due to them both relying on basic attacks and abilties to carry.





- ap (ability power) carry is now mp (magical power) carry. Reasoning: Similair reasoning as with attack damage. However, the term fit earlier, but lately more magic gods' basic attacks have begun to scale with mp, ultimately busting the term.





- aa (auto attack) is now ba (basic attack). Reasoning: basic attacks are neither self continuous nor automaticly hitting, thus making basic attack (also called in hand attack) a more fitting term.





I feel that there are many with the same opinion as I have. What do you say?
Let's hear what /r/smite thinks!

Me and a friend just moved from LoL, we really like this game and we hope in a great future for smite.
What we don't like is that we can't play together on a competitive level anymore.
That really kills the fun for both of us and we will probably quit the game if they dont implement the ""solo/duo queue"".
It has nothing to do with us wanting to ""cheat"" the system, its all about playing together like we used to do in the last few years on LoL.

Using common sense we can dictate that this was because:

A) New teams get stomped by the experienced ones, so why bother entering?

B) New teams that get dominated by the pro ones usually disband out of embarrassment, as discussed [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1fh9bw/na_tourney_bm/)

I propose that we have two separate tournaments for each region, one for pro teams and one for new teams.

Whoever wins the new bracket gets bumped up into the pro bracket the following weekend, and whoever loses their first round in the pro bracket has to fight it out with other first round losers to avoid getting relegated to the lower bracket.

This will of course require more management on behalf of Hirez but I believe it definitely be worth the effort as it will lead to more teams participating and the growth of Smite as a whole.

Thoughts?

1. Just wanted to say first and foremost that this mode is about taking and holding possession of the obelisks. Unfortunately this does not seem to be understood by some people.

2. Chasing kills is a sure way to lose towers. Most of the time you are being baited to leave your tower undefended. 

3. When your team is down and you only have one tower it is not worth having 2 people defending the one tower your team owns. Only have one defend and have the rest storm a tower. 

4. When storming a tower don't choose the one that they have 4 people defending.

5. Many like to start with a 0-3-2 but personally I think that a 2-1-2 is the best starting configuration this allows your team to easily take the unattended tower and it is easy to shift over once the unattended tower is taken, or even leaving only one to take the tower. Also if the enemy takes mid you just defend the other 2, with smart play and not getting baited they will have to storm one tower with 3+ people and then your team just shifts over and takes mid.

Because even tho 1 thing that is very important in MOBA's is your mana management. If you are having trouble with your mana then buying Meditation is not the solution. 5 mana pots costs you 250g, same price as Meditation. It just let's you fall into this trap that Meditation is a good ability(It can be useful on a handful of gods) And if you dont waste your mana on just throwing out random spells on nothing and uses a mana pot when you are at ~ 50% i highly doubt you will run out of mana in the early game. 


What i think should be on the reccomended tab for abilities are either Beads/Sprint or Aegis/Sprint. Sprint can be very good for new players that may have overextended slightly and find themself in a dire spot to get out.

Orginal Post on Hirez Forums - http://forum.hirezstudios.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=344&amp;t=94800&amp;p=1161655#p1161655

reposted on this forum section from general discussion

Introduction. (Patch 0.1.1288.8) Updated 1/18/2013

I'm *Allied* from Juice Gaming, my team consists of some of the top players right now and i decided i want to release what is based off most of our opinions a competitive tier list right now in the current metagame in 5v5 conquest. These are based of PICKS in competitive 5v5, not solo queue or ranked.



Tier 1 - Hel, Sobek, Ra, Ymir, Agni

Tier 2 -Bacchus, Wukong, Vamana, Thor, Odin, Hades, Guan Yu, He bo, Anhur, Ao Kuang

Tier 3 -Artemis, Freya, Zeus, Bakasura, Bastet, Ares, Cupid, Xbalaque, Loki

Tier 4 -Kali, Arachne, Anubis

Hard to place - Hercules


**Tier 1** - Right now the trend in the competitive scene is Healing and Tanks. Healing is way too strong and tanks are way too tanky. You noticed that Agni snuck back into Tier 1, thats because he turns into first pick material if Ra and Hel are banned, in my current opinion Hel and Ra are easily the 2 best mid gods atm mostly because of high burst damage, natural tankyness and healing. On Top of that Sobek and Ymir are top picks atm because of the Ymir buff (3 second freeze lol wat?) and Sobek's utility is off the charts with his insane passive (hits harder than some AD carries do at level's 1-5).

**Tier 2** - As you noticed bacchus is on top mostly because remember that ""nerf"" to his chug? well imo that ended up being a insane buff because now hes even tankier, not to mention his moveset hasn't been touched he remains such a solid tank pick if Sobek or Ymir are taken/banned.

Vamana is back now because of his insane buff (CC immunity in ult form and focus removed from his HP regen while he is in Ult form). Thor is just a super good AD carry now because of his really good utility while being able to dish out TONS of damage.

Guan Yu drops down because simply the constant abuse of being overnerfed patch after patch has really taken toll but its also amazing because i've never seen a character so overnerfed and still be a solid pick.

Ao Kuang Snuck on to Tier 2 because in situations when Ra and Hel are banned, you end up seeing a lot more Ao Kuang mid because hes the best stalemate solution when there are no other mid picks (Hirez needs to add more Mid gods yo).

**Tier 3** - Not too much has changed besides Zeus and Freya moving up, New items now make these characters even better and more viable so you will continue to see more of these two in competitive play (Demonic Grip!).

Why ares so low? even with the buff, many people have figured out how to get around Ares really strong laning phase and make it really weak, with other tanks being way more versatile and useful, Ares barely gets picked anymore. Hes still pretty solid just pretty lackluster compared to Ymir / Sobek, etc

Yeah i know, Loki is last place even though he dishes out insane damage. As i said before, The current theme atm is Tanks and Healing, and considering how tanky you can get without really trying, Squishy Loki has a hard time preforming his job of Assassinating, ESPECIALLY in a teamfight when you have Sobek and Ymir CCing you to death. Making him a EXTREME counterpick character, hes still really solid and you may see him occasionally but that requires the right circumstances for him to come out.

**Tier 4?** well heres the thing these characters just don't fit anywhere i feel, they have too many flaws and even though some teams may pick them, they just don't fit into most team comps and need buffs / fixes to make them more viable in certain areas that they are weak (Arachne horrible late game for example).

**Hercules?** well yes hes OP but no team has tried him out in a competitive scrim yet! hes auto banned because of tournaments, so i can't say yet! my personal opinion is hes strong and most likely you could see him as a top pick. Who knows though!



Explaination on Tiers

**Tier 1**- You WANT to pick these gods as soon as possible, they are game changing and bring the most to teamfights, they are extremely strong in what they do, they have really little counters - These are your 1st - 2nd picks

**Tier 2** - These are after the initial picks, you use these to fill up the slots as these are all extremely STRONG picks still but aren't as valuable as tier 1 picks. These are your 3rd - 4th picks

**Tier 3** - These are situational picks and counterpicks but with good team communication you can use these gods to make your team really strong, these are by no means horrible gods but they aren't tier 1 or 2 material. These are your 4th - 5th picks

(New)**Tier 4**- These characters are hard to place on a competitive team atm because they have certain problems or lack the qualities needed to compete with other good picks, they could be really good in Solo Queue but aren't as good in competitive play. You still could potentially see these Gods picked however with the right team setup

How about a God that uses his gold as a resource instead of mana?

So this is my idea for Mercury the merchant God.



**Accomplished Barterer**(*Passive*): Mercury receives a discount of x% when spending in the shop and receives a passive gold gain of x gp5.


**Bribery**: Mercury pays  2/3/4/5/6 enemy minions/small jungle creeps to fight for him for x seconds. At max level, Mercury can also bribe enemy gods.
Cost: x gold
Cd: x s

**Coin toss**: Mercury throws a shower of coins in an arc in front of him doing x/x/x/x/x damage.
Cost: x gold
Cd: x s

**Golden trail**: Mercury releases coins behind him as he runs leaving behind a trail of golden coins. Enemy gods on the trail will be slowed by x/x/x/x/x%. All gods collect a passive increase of gold per second whilst on the trail.
Cost: x gold.
Cd: x s

**Coin Shower**(*ult*): Mercury scatters gold around him in a circle causing enemy gods to run in a random direction to collect coins for x/x/x/x/x seconds. All gods will collect a passive increase of gold per second whilst in the circle.
Cost: x gold.
Cd: x s

1371308096.0,35,self.Smite,1gegkd,God Skin Ideas,LolSnowman,49,14,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1gegkd/god_skin_ideas/,"I've been playing Smite since the closed beta and have been around to see many changes to the game and the styles of play. Throughout I've compiled a list of god skin ideas just for fun. I'm mostly a lurker but I played so much yesterday I dreamed about Smite and for some reason couldn't get it out of my head. So I decided to dump them all for you all to critique. 

-**Cupid**
Cupid was the first god I played and eventually got very good at. You wouldn't believe how difficult he was being underpowered with his irritatingly useless ult. Since then he's come a long way, however, he has some pretty weak skins in my opinion. I always felt he needed a little more oomph. I would like to introduce, **Heartbreaker Cupid.** Styled after a greaser or maybe the Fonz, he'd sport a slick hairstyle with wicked shades and a sleek leather jacket. Rolling up, blasting people with his heartbomb. It'd be so appropriate... *swoon.*

-**Anubis**
When I decided I'd like to try improving and taking the game a little more seriously I thought Anubis would be the god for that... unfortunately he's one of the least viable gods out there now. I do completely destroy with him in solo queue conquest though. Since I think his Grave Hound is just a bit lacking I got his recolorization with the Nightwalker skin, which is sick. What I would like for our intimidatingly squishy friend is a figure almost everyone in the world knows, famous for countless movies and shows. I'd like a Scooby-Doo skin, motherfucking **Scooby-Nubis.** SCOOBY-FUCKING-NUBIS. Nuff said.

-**Agni**
Agni is a scary god, I don't like midding against him, I don't like people that play him. His kit is extremely irritating and I've always found him difficult to counter for some reason. Since I've played awhile I have learned to lead characters. Predict peoples movements and determine what to do from there, Agni is hard to predict because of his weird dance leap. It's... so long. Which made me think it'd be immensely appropriate if he had a jester skin. **Jester Agni.** I thought Loki might do well with a jester skin but HiRez might want to steer clear of the Shaco knockoff and give the more leapy god his jingle bell hat.

-**Loki**
Speaking of Loki, I was thinking an **Iron Chef Loki.** But it would be a toss up between him and Bakasura. Baka eats, make him the chef right? The image in my mind has Loki as the much cooler Chef though. Just think, he assassinates you with a frying pan in one hand and running away with his toque bobbing. Oh happy day, he cooked another feeder.

-**Ymir/Agni**
Ymir is a free god and I honestly don't care how many skins each god has. The game isn't even officially out yet and I imagine many more years for this game to grow and even become quite successful. With that, why not add another skin, I've always liked the reverse of elements so **Flaming Ymir** and **Icicle Agni** were two quick concepts I thought of. Again, these are just for fun and I like to imagine a giant flaming ogre who instead of freezing, turns people to a crisp or a huge frozen meteor smashing down... then I remember I don't like Agni and RELEASE THE KRAKEN. (Poseidon players represent!)

-**Fenrir**
Originally the next skin idea that I had was for Anhur, his physique, model and play style is better suited for it. However, I think it'd be hilarious if Fenrir was running up as **Dog the Bounty Hunter.** Get it? He's a dog? I'm still actually not sure about this one, because I still think Anhur would do better with a safari or outback type skin and for some reason I think bounty hunter and I think Australia.

-**Ne Zha**
I heard rumor that there might be a robo-Anubis in the making, as much as I like robots I think Digi-Ymir was a bit much and imo a bit of a stretch. The concept probably should have been used on a more appropriate god. Either way, I propose using the Scooby-Nubis skin and giving Ne Zha an Astro Boy skin. **Astro Ne Zha.** It just fits!!


Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read through this column of text. Skim if you'd like. I would also like to list skins I've read on this sub, I won't claim idea ownership. I'm also not going to hunt down every person who made up each idea but I figure a refresher would be nice.

-**Xbal**
Ninja Xbalanque, pretty self explanatory. (Fix his 3!!!)

-**Apollo**
Someone had a really great idea for a promotional skin for Apollo that I read sometime ago, it was in a comment thread I think and not an actual post. **Messenger Apollo**, something about email subscribing for HiRez and their poor choice of third party promoting. I forget, so don't quote me on that. Or that.

-**Sun WuKong**
Mojo Jojo.

-Gameplay, he is so plain also, he just runs after you, and he in-hand attack you to death. I mean even the Manticore had some abilities of his own, and it's something I would love to see the Minotaur have.

1367617317.0,34,self.Smite,1dn7lv,Re-balancing Ares - List of Buffs/Nerfs/Reworks Explained,Booman61,53,19,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1dn7lv/rebalancing_ares_list_of_buffsnerfsreworks/,"What I have in mind for Ares involves a LOT of change and reworking, so please take it ALL into consideration before judging any single particular buff/nerf/rework.


So I've been trying to piece together a way to make Ares a viable *support tank*, making him a solid pick for competitive play, but not a pub-stomping pain in the ass in casual play. That means:

- Granting him the ability to peel effectively

- The ability to handle creep waves

- Being a better protector towards his carry

- Making his Ultimate more consistent, yet still fair

- Rewarding the player for being accurate and consistent with abilities


I'm suggesting a small change to Bolster Defenses, a moderate change to both Searing Flesh and No Escape, and a large change to Shackles. This does involve removing his horrid cripple.


I'll start with Bolster Defenses, as it is the simplest change. To better protect carries (and perhaps present a small sense of peel / deter enemies from attacking), I think that adding a percentage of damage reflection would be a good addition. Mitigated damage that is, none of the Nemean Lion nonsense that ignores protections! Bolstered allies reflect 8/11/14/17/20% of basic-attack (post-mitigated) damage and 2/4/6/8/10% of ability-based (post-mitigated) damage back to the attacker as Magical Damage. The player damage should be credited to Ares and Bolster Defenses in the damage report. However I am not a fan of granting ""free damage"" without good player judgement, and would suggest reducing the lifetime of the Bolster Defenses buff to 4 seconds to accompany this reflection change. This means that Ares will have to skillfully time the activation of Bolster Defenses in anticipation of incoming damage in order to mitigate and reflect the best part of it back at the attackers.


I'll go with Shackles next, seeing as it is his signature ability and I can't explain the other changes very well without these first. So even when built full tank, this move deals RIDICULOUS damage! I'm sure we can all agree. In it's current state, Shackles does 25/45/65/85/105 (+15%) on hit, and also ticks for the same damage 4 more times over 4 seconds. And that's not including the fact that Ares can fire another 2 chains within 2 seconds of each other for even more hits/ticks... for 0 mana cost. If you focus the same enemy God with all 3 chains, you can get ~12 total ticks of damage over time. In a realistic situation (considering Ares' bonus Magical Power contribution vs enemy carries who generally don't build Magical Protection), Shackles will be hitting for around 90 per tick at Level 5 (and that is a Tank Ares with just a Void Stone contributing). Ticking over 10 times at ~90 per tick... and this is just one ability, potentially dealing over 1000 damage on top of a Cripple/Speed-Leech.

So let's not kid ourselves, this is an absurd amount of damage for any non-ultimate ability, particularly a tank's primary ability. I believe Shackles should be as much about utility/CC as possible, and much less about damage (I have Searing Flesh in mind as the primary damage dealer, but we'll get to that move later). So needless to say, I'd start by reducing the damage significantly. I also do not see why this needs to be a DoT. I agree that Shackles can be difficult to land, and Ares is almost useless if he misses the first chain, but I feel that this applies to any move in the game. Sobek doesn't get a second chance if he misses Charge Prey, so I don't feel that Ares should be exempt from this rule. However with this rework, missing a Shackle should not make Ares as worthless as he supposedly was before.

First of all; Damage. I suggest making Shackles deal 50/75/100/125/150 (+50% of Magical Power) on hit. No extra ticks, just a straight-up nuke. He can still follow up with up to 2 more chains as per usual for more damage, if he wishes to. This means that a pure-tank Ares will not undeservingly shred enemies, but building Magical Power items will reward him nicely with the +50% contribution. However with a realistic build, Ares would be dealing around 300-400 damage if he hits all 3 Shackles on an enemy, which is far more acceptable than in it's current state and is still a respectable amount.

The second change to Shackles; Crowd Control. Ares currently has almost no form of peel to protect his partner. He can slow them with Shackles or blow his Ultimate for a chance to Pull/Stun, which would likely be a huge waste just to cope with a little enemy harassment. The Bolster Defense damage-reflection is a small form of deterrence, but it will not prevent every fight of course. I suggest granting Shackles an interrupt. Like a 0.000001 second Silence, to break a move like Berserker Barrage, Drain Life, Taolu Assault, Plague of Locusts, Clear the Path etc... channeled moves. I don't want Shackles to actually Silence enemies like Hades can, just a brief interrupt that cancels enemies' channeled abilities. This does not make Hades' Shroud of Darkness inferior, as a 2-second Fear is so huge in a fight. This will simply give Ares a way to peel and defend his ally in certain situations.

Lastly on Shackles; remove the Cripple. It is unnecessary with all these new alterations in mind, and most of all... it is off-the-scales of annoying. Ares does not need it, and it is not a mechanic that should be handed out lightly.


Next up is Searing Flesh! This move is currently pretty awful early game, and will be particularly lackluster without the enormous ticking damage from the current Shackles. However, with the newly proposed Shackles, I had planned to make Searing Flesh a little more powerful vs Gods to compensate, and much better vs Minions.

The idea is to increase the damage of Searing Flesh to 30/35/40/45/50 (15% of Magical Power) per tick, keeping the same bonus damage based on a percentage of the enemies' max HP. Secondly, make Searing Flesh deal 50% extra damage to Minions, Jungle Creeps and Pets. This change makes Ares more capable vs creep waves, which he desperately needs. It also makes up for a small amount of lost damage from the current Shackles' ticking, without overdoing it and keeping his damage output from being ridiculous. Searing Flesh is now a little stronger than Taolu Assault, but Taolu Assault has more utility as it steals Protections, whereas Searing Flesh is purely intended to be a damage move.


Finally, No Escape. This is of course one of the most tricky moves that Smite has had to balance because it is SO powerful... when it works. No Escape is amazing but has a huge amount of counters and would be far too strong if it were not so counter-able. What's the answer? I think I've figured it out.

Firstly; Cooldown. Increase the cooldown on No Escape to 150 seconds. Why should most of the Ultimates in Smite be based around a 90-second cooldown? I look at Ra and Arachne, and I see fairly ""meh"" ultimate abilities. Arachne has a tricky single-target pull, and Ra just has a long-range nuke. If they were on 90 second cooldowns they would be pretty poor Ultimates. What makes Cocoon and Searing Pain function well in comparison to other Ultimates is the low cooldowns; Cocoon every 30 seconds, Searing Pain every 50 seconds. With this in mind, I believe making the cooldown on No Escape higher than average will better represent the tenacity of the Ultimate more, and will put us in a better place to discuss countering the Ultimate.

Secondly; Countering. No Escape is up there with Pillar of Agony as one of the most easily countered moves in the game, and is a real anti-climax to a brilliant Ultimate. Which in a way is understandable, as it is horrifying to be caught by Ares' Ultimate. However, No Escape can currently be avoided through Purification Beads, Aegis Amulet, Cleanse and a huge number of Ultimates that grant CC-immunity for their duration (e.g. Searing Pain, Shards of Ice, Death Gaze, Valkyrie's Discretion, Anvil of Dawn, Lurking in the Waters, Desert Fury... the list goes on and on). Between all of these counters, it is extremely unlikely that Ares will find a target who does not have a counter ready at his disposal, and it feels like Ares may as well just not even bother all game. I think there is a much better way to deal with this.

I suggest having an influence from Shackles play a part in No Escape's execution. Here's my proposed change; If Ares casts No Escape on a plain enemy, then the enemy may Beads/Aegis/Counter-Ult etc as we know it now. However, if an enemy is Shackled and Ares casts No Escape on him, he is silenced for the 2.5 seconds where Ares is preparing to pull. This means that the Shackled enemy cannot use any abilities, including a Counter-Ult and Aegis Amulet. The only way out from here is to use Purification Beads, a rare CC-breaker (i.e. Kali's Frenzy or Aphrodite's Undying Love) or for Hel to Cleanse you.

The point of this is to reward Ares for Shackling an enemy prior to Pulling, and granting him a better (but not 100%) chance to pull the targets for his efforts. You might only Shackle one enemy, but if you can Shackle 3 of them AND catch them in the Ultimate's AoE, I think you deserve a huge Pull. Simply put, if Ares doesn't make a good effort and just runs in to Ult and pull, nothing changes and he can be easily countered. However if he makes the effort and accurately lands his chains, he is rewarded by cancelling out half of the enemies' counters. Not only does this make No Escape a much more viable move, it becomes a rewarding ability if the players performs it well BUT it is kept in check by being the only Ultimate in the game with a 150-second cooldown.


That's it. It is quite a large amount of reworking but I picture a much, much better Ares with all of these changes implemented. I couldn't possibly TL;DR this because such a significant amount of buffs/nerfs/reworks need to be explained in great detail. I can summarize though:

Shackles is no longer a DoT that ticks, and is instead just a nuke that deals significantly less overall damage. Cripple is removed, but being linked still leeches speed. Upon connecting a Chain, any channeled moves (e.g. Berserker Barrage) are interrupted and cut short. Ares can continue to fire up to 2 more chains on a successful hit.

Bolster Defenses' lifetime is reduced to 4 seconds. Allies with the buff now reflect a percentage of damage (post-mitigated) back at the attacker as Magical Damage.

Searing Flesh deals slightly more damage than before, and now deals 50% extra damage vs Minions, Jungle Creeps and Pets.

No Escape's cooldown increased to 150 seconds. An enemy who is afflicted by Shackles is Silenced as Ares casts No Escape and cannot use abilities/actives. Players must use Purification Beads, CC-breaking abilities or must be Cleansed to avoid being Pulled/Stunned by Ares if Shackled.


So if you are able to picture this brand new Ares, how would you feel about him in comparison to the Ares of today? As a Support/Tank, do you agree that this is far more viable and realistic for competitive play, and do you agree this would be a much more likeable and fair God in casual play?

It could be a valuable tool for sponsored teams as well, allowing them to get the iconography of their sponsors onto the map in a more visible way than simply having an overlay to the game while streaming.

The remake focuses around his new passive, which will greatly weaken enemies and strength Ares in long term fights and also in lane.  Ares relies on dealing large damage over time and holding enemies still in combat.

**Feedback is greatly appreciated and encouraged.  Please tell me what you think about it and explain what parts are good/bad.  Don't pay too much thought to number balance as that can easily be changed.**


**Ares - God of War**

Role - MAGE BRUISER

Pantehon - Greek


**Innate - Scars of War**

*Ares marks enemy gods he damages with Scars of War, draining a small portion of the target's protections to Ares.  Scars of War vanish from enemies that stay far away from Ares for a short period.* 

* Each stack steals 1% of the target's protections and gives them to Ares (max of 25 stacks).
* Ares cannot gain more than 50% of his current protections from this passive. (if you have 100 base physical protection this passive can only give you an extra 50 physical protection)
* The debuff decreases by 1 stack for each second the enemy is away from Ares (more than 55 feet away)



**(1) Shackles** 

*Ares sends out a chain, damaging minions in a line and latching onto the first enemy god it hits.  A shackled enemy is crippled, slowed, and takes damage over time.  If Ares hits an enemy, he can re-use this ability up to 2 extra times at no cost.  When Ares can throw no more chains, the debuff timer of the shackles starts.* 

* Does 80/140/200/260/320 (+30% magic power) magic damage to minions
* Shackled enemies take 10/16/22/28/34 (+3% magic power) magic damage every 0.5 seconds for 2 seconds
* Shackles enemies are slowed by 15% for the duration, while Ares gains that movespeed as well
* Ares has 2 seconds between chains to re-use it before it goes on cooldown
* The Shackle debuff timer starts when this ability goes on cooldown (enemies Shackled beforehand suffer the effects for longer)


**(2) Bolster Defenses** 

*Ares strengthens the resolve of himself and his allies.  Battle-Scarred enemies also deal a percentage less to buffed allies and Ares.* 

* Grants 18/21/24/27/30% CC reduction to Ares and nearby allies (stacks with Resolve)
* Enemies with Scars of War deal 1% less damage to buffed allies for each stack they have on them
* Lasts for 8 seconds and affects Allies within 35 feet of Ares


**(3) Searing Flesh** 

*Flames pour from Ares' shield, burning enemies alive.  Does a flat portion of magic damage plus pure damage based on the target's max health.  The pure damage is amplified on small creeps.* 

* Does 15/20/25/30/35 (+3% magical power) magic damage every 0.5 seconds for 4 seconds
* Does an extra 3% pure damage every 0.5 seconds for 4 seconds (this damage will not double the stacks of Scars of War added by this ability)
* Minions take twice as much % pure damage from this ability (6% every 0.5 seconds).  This will not affect Gold Fury or Fire Giant, but works on buff holders.


**(ult) No Escape** 

*Ares throws chains out to all enemies gods around him, slowly dragging them toward him over a short duration.  Enemies that attempt to resist are damaged.  Ares can act normally and use abilities while this skill is active; he is not CC immune.* 

* Affects enemies within 35 feet of Ares
* Ares pulls enemies at a rate of 150 speed toward him (this is countered by the enemy's movespeed, meaning an enemy with 450 movespeed will feel like they are moving at 300 movespeed if they try to run [33% slow].  An enemy with 300 movespeed would be moving at 150 speed [50% slow])
* Enemies moving away from Ares take 30/45/60/75/90 (+10% magic power) magic damage every 0.5 seconds (this includes time spent using dash/leap abilities).
* Ability lasts for up to 4 seconds.  Using beads only negates the pull effect, not the damage.  Beads cannot completely remove the chains, only negate their pull for a few seconds.",SUGGESTION,False,,t5_2stl8,1375088753.0,suggestion,,True,t3_1j9l6k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1j9l6k/god_remake_ares_god_of_war_mage_bruiser/,

1373232713.0,37,self.Smite,1htn15,Let's discuss dodging.,Daekin,42,5,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1htn15/lets_discuss_dodging/,"I've recently been playing quite a bit of ranked after a lot of casual. I have gone from 1100 to 1600 Elo.

Now, I don't find this to be a high rank. Perhaps mid level rank. Yet, dodging is not just happening, it's happening **often**. Not only is it happening often, people will literally tell you straight up ""Anubis? Oh i'm dodging this"" then they proceed to do exactly that.

Now, the problem that this presents? Everyone has to wait 12ish more minutes to even get a Q for a new game. About 15-16 more minutes to actually be in0game and playing. The dodger? He misses 1 queue. Just 1. He(She) can go have something to eat, or whatever. Come back and q up for the second ranked match.

It's barely a punishment. Most people playing ranked don't care about the goodwill. Anyone dodging *obviously* doesn't care about goodwill. Mostly because goodwill is all but meaningless. 

My point of all this, is there needs to be a much stricter punishment for leaving a **ranked** game. Especially in lobby. In ranked you are expected to have the time, and connection required to last an entire match. If you have neither of those, or you dodge, you deserve to not be allowed to play another game (Or **atleast** ranked) for quite a while.

You messed up a game for an entire team, and wasted 9 other peoples time. You don't deserve to be allowed to play for a while.

Several days ago, I had 5 dodgers back to back. That is well over an hour of waiting to play a ranked *purely* because of dodgers, nothing else. Not DC's, or BM, or Rage quits. **just dodging**.

And again, I am only 1600 Elo. What is this like when I hit 2k+? 3k? I can't imagine it gets better.

So personally, i've stopped playing Ranked. I'd rather actually play the game, even if it's with shitty randoms in casual.

Better than hoping an over-lenient, borderline useless punishment system for dodging will deter the next person who doesn't like the picks/bans.

Am I wrong? Do you guys consider the punishment system in ranked for dodging to be sufficient? Am I crazy?

**Edit:**

So, this thread gained more traction than I thought, which I am glad. Perhaps it will grab the attention of a rogue HiRez employee.

What seems popular is the answer of ""*I don't want harsher punishments because I dodge for [reasons].*""

It seems like dodging is so easy, and such a useless punishment for it, that almost everyone does it. Most people on here admitted that if they don't think the game is favourable by the end of lobby, they would dodge, and gladly so.

This is why stricter punishments need to be in place. None of these people care about any but themselves, it's evident in every post. They're only interested in more Elo, and more wins. Since dodging doesn't effect either, it's the best choice for those selfish people.

Since the actions of Hirez and Curse are leading to a dead EU scene, we've taken it upon ourselves to simply 'kill' the EU scene temporarily.

1370418540.0,36,self.Smite,1fpjsx,Should we have that? A shopkeeper,LolaRuns,53,17,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1fpjsx/should_we_have_that_a_shopkeeper/,"Example Game: League http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atFhEUJaCoo 

Shopkeepers are a long tradition in various MOBAs. It would mostly add a face to the buying process, but imo their main function is the potential to add flavor.

**Pro**

(A) The shopkeeper could greet the player who is shopping adding additional flavor by using their titles, ""Good day Master Of the Oceans"" for Poseidon for example. 

(B) They could comment on bought items. ""Good choice"" or ""one of my finest items"" or ""this will invigorate you"" (on buying potions for example) or ""You know, you can't give that back"" for an active item

(C) When the god has finished shopping the shopkeeper could bid them goodbye and cheer them on (""Go give 'em hell!"")

(D) They could be an excellent candidate for voice packs with different flavors and different types of jokes. Or even skins for the shop keeper (greedy gnome, hulking smith, mythical monster, busty maid, sympathetic old guy, creepy old crone, or just clothes for every pantheon type). 

**(E)** Slightly different but related: when they have finished an item the gods could say the names of the items out loud ( example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv6eXuwFCLA )  or even say a line about it's functionality ""I dare them to attack me"" for Hide for example or ""this shall protect me nicely"" for a protective item or ""The jungle is not safe from me"" for Bumba's. Could actually have a learning benefit for people to remember the names of the items.  

**Counter Arguments**

1.) I feel it would be more hard to fit thematically why gods from so many different pantheons would shop at the same person's. There's also that the spawn area of Smite is really exposed compared to other MOBAs, so it would be weird to have an npc there. Wouldn't he call for help or run away when the enemy team is storming the base? 

2.) The buying process in Smite feels really streamlined and adding this could make it feel more clunky even if nothing about the process actually changes

3.) It's particularly pointless in Smite compared to the isometric mobas because you just buy from spawn and don't physically walk to a spot/click somewhere to get your items. 

4.) No reason to have it just because many other MOBAs have it/might even be a way distinguish yourself and give yourself a different feel. (though Smite isn't the only one who hasn't one)

5.) Any type of additional voice work probably doesn't come cheap. 

**My overall opinion**: Meh. On one hand I really like the chance for more flavor and/or to get some sort of audio feedback on your buying process. On the other I feel there are valid points against it/it is pretty superfluous. Maybe experiment by putting one into one of the side game modes. Or do the thing where the gods say the names of items first.

This is my idea for improving it.


[This a general mockup, my photoshop skills are not great.](http://i.imgur.com/m4u2Opq)


If the ability is available to cast (off of cooldown) the targeter is visible.

Still show the blue arrow for ranged gods, this arrow actually shows the range of your basic attacks and changes length for every god which a lot of people don't realise.

Remove the yellow coloring in the center of the targeters to make it less obtrusive.

Change the borders for every targeter. Make each ability for every god have a unique border, like He Bo's 2. Though this would take quite a bit of work so another option would be to simply change the colors, preferably making them uniform throughout all gods. Something like ability 1 is green, 2 is blue, 3 is red, and 4 is purple.

I feel like this would make instant cast immensely better and if implemented the other two cast options could probably be removed, though keeping them to give people options is okay. Any ideas to improve upon what I have come up with?

Poseidon's attacks cause his Tide mechanic to increase and casting abilities causes it to decease. When he at 0% and 100% his attacks deals 30% extra damage with some scaling amounts in between.

**WATER BLADE -**
Poseidon casts a wave that travels in a line dealing damage + magic power and pushing back all enemies in the path. Reduces Tide by 35.

**TIDAL SURGE -**
Poseidon charges his trident granting additional move speed and making his auto attacking spread out two additional shots which hit for 50% of his physical power, BUT cannot critically hit or apply on hit effects. Reduces Tide by 35.

**WHIRLPOOL -**
Poseidon creates a whirlpool that pulls enemies toward the center dealing damage + magic power and also dealing % of their max health every .5s for 4s. Reduces Tide by 30.

**RELEASE THE KRAKEN -**
Need I say more? Poseidon calls forth a mighty KRAKEN dealing a large amount of damage + magical power to targets in the center when it spawns, stunning for 2s, and bouncing them into the air. Enemies caught one the edge are slowed and take damage over time. Reduces Tide by 40.

(This is not a bash post on WOGL, i love the steps they are taking with trying to grow the Smite E-Sports scene.)
I myself am rather new to the Smite/Moba scene but that doesn’t mean I am new to the e-sports scene.  My name is Patrick, also known as my handle OctanePro. I have been volunteering my time and talent within the StarCraft 2 scene for a few years; with running and organizing tournaments to producing podcast and community content for several organizations:

Starcraft II RebirthTournament League
The StarCast Podcast
The Strategist StarCraft 2 Show
Several StarCraft 2 Casting Positions

So I have a decent amount of background in the Starcraft 2 e-sports scene, yet please correct me if I am wrong in any way.
Teamliquids main gaming community is Starcraft 2, with that said their website gets more viewers than the Blizzard Official Starcraft 2 forums, all because of what TeamLiquid has to offer the community. I think WOGL is on the right path, but there are a few things that might help jump start the scene even more; One being an event calendar for the WOGL Season 1 Smite Tournament &amp; Community Events.

My recommendation:
I think it would be a good idea for WOGL to setup some type of system on their website for when 2 teams decide on a time and date for their round match in the Match Comm. that you can sync it up with a Public Calendar. So at any time any WOGL/Smite fan can check the calendar for the upcoming matches.  In that same form a spot to put in a link to who is streaming would be excellent! I understand that WOGL is trying to cast/stream as many matches as possible, but the more community coverage the better for the Smite scene as a whole.

Link to TeamLiquid Calendar submission form picture: (You must be logged in to view the URL normally):
http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/3936/31655596.jpg 

Requirements to Submit a Calendar Event: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=158090
We (the Smite Community) could even take this further for WOGL and people could submit event request, like Teamliquid does.  So for example if two teams decide to do a scrimmage they can submit an event to WOGL. A staff member could approve it and bam it's listed on the calendar for all to see. It would be amazing to see Tournament Matches, Scrimmages, Giveaway Events, Charity Events all listed on one Smite Public Calendar.  It would be amazing to make WOGL the Smite HUB for the e-sports community. (I am in no way affiliated with WOGL)

I don't believe this is something Hi Rez (publisher of Smite) should be handling.  E-Sports grass roots communities are not successful when run by the publishers of the game. For a strong e-sports scene to survive it needs a strong community foundation to make any game a successful e-sport.  Anyways this is just my 2 cents, please feel free to add to this.
If this is already in place and I am not aware I do apologize for feeding the trolls.
If someone from WOGL wants help with this project please messages me on twitch, I'd love to help. My twitch streaming name is OctaneProscii. You should be able to catch me daily streaming gameplay.

As we all know, communication is EVERYTHING when playing Smite. I can't stress it enough - if you don't communicate you will lose.

Luckily Smite has an awesome built in voice system to help us all communicate. Sadly, not enough people use it. Now, the voice command system can look daunting, there are dozens of commands. What I'd like to do is narrow it down to the essential ones. If you memorise these commands you will perform better, you're team will perform better and you WILL win more. Here is the list of what i believe is essential, in this guide;

1 = LEFT LANE
2 = MIDDLE LANE
3 = RIGHT LANE
G = GOLD FURY
M = MINOTAUR
F = FIRE GIANT

VA 1 2 3 G F M- Attack - This helps tell your lane partner/jungler to initiate on the enemy.

VC 1 2 3 - Be Careful - This tells the respective lane there is possible danger and they should take care.

VD 1 2 3 G F M- Defend - This tells your team mates to defend - for example if a tower will be pushed defend that lane. Or defend the Gold Fury for instance.

VF 1 2 3 - Enemy Missing - This lets your team know your enemy is missing and you have no idea where they are.

VG 1 2 3 - Gank - This tells your jungler or lane partner to gank. Its more for junglers.

VH 1 2 3 - Help - Struggling in lane? you can let your team know you need help. being chased? same again.

VI 1 2 3 - Incoming - You have seen the enemy going in a certain direction? let your team mates know. It will save lives.

VR 1 2 3 - Retreat - Team mates in danger? out of position? tell them to retreat.

VT 1 2 3 - Enemy Returned - your enemy has returned, tell your team so they don't have to play so cautiously.

VVA - OK

VVN - No

VVY - Yes

VVX - Cancel That


There are other commands that are helpful, but if you use the above list and memorise it you should be able to communicate everything you need.

Its really not that complex, 1 2 3 F G M after a command always says the same thing. The letters also make sense when trying to remember. A = Attack, D = Defend for example.

Anyway, I hope this guide is of use to some new players as lack of communication is the number one trap I see new players fall into. It is also possibly the source of so much rage. Being ganked without warning drives people nuts. So let them know! VI!

If you have any questions please let me know.

1375797307.0,32,self.Smite,1jt7aw,A potential Mid gold harpy change for the better of the game.,The_Anamull,52,20,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1jt7aw/a_potential_mid_gold_harpy_change_for_the_better/,"This idea is coming from personal experience and is a judgement on the current ""flow"" of the game. I believe the mid lane furies are forcing large, game breaking teamfights a little bit too early. I find smaller skirmishes early/mid game and the large teamfights endgame to be more exciting. Yes Hi-Rez wants action, and 3vs3 or 2vs2 skirmishes IS action. It also allows more exhilarating plays such as Gold Fury and Fire Giant steals. Example: Skirmish at mid gold involving the Junglers and Mid's. One team comes out on top and calls for a gold furry. There are still enough players alive on the currently handicapped team to contest the objective for an exciting play.  So how can we take away the 4-5 man rotations on the middle camps but still keep it exciting and action packed? Here is my suggestion..

Middle camps are changed from 2 large furies to 1 large fury + 3 small furies. What does this change?
Currently the mid gold (if solo'd) is worth 90 gold and 280 exp,
with the changes (if solo'd) it would be worth 84 gold and 206 exp

Reasons why mid will still be contested with changes: it's free gold and exp, and with the addition of 1 more minion, it's 1 more stack on items. However, the reduction of 74 exp is QUITE significant to make the support tank/ ranged adc/ solo not want to rotate. 

Change number 2. Rotate the mid camps to face Northwest/Southeast. This will make invading the gold camps slightly riskier. Without wards, walking around the corner could be the biggest mistake of your life. Please view the terribly made image using Paint. 

http://imgur.com/C29vhRp

Benefits: Slightly safer to do the camps, still easily could be contested. However, you could be choked off by a flank from behind, with a narrow escape route this could mean inevitable death. I moved the camps to be a little more towards each side and not directly in the middle.

This is a lot to read, hope it was worth your time, please critique. I honestly believe if this change was made Smite would be in such an amazing place. Thanks guys!

My name is Chiyuri (*IGN: Chiwa*) and would just like to let you know that we are doing a **24hr Fundraising Stream for Bipolar Method** to help them go to Gamescom. We have been a big fan of this team ever since Smite started and honestly know that they deserve to represent their great gameplay on  the upcoming tournament.


As you know, they aren't sponsored by any organization or professional team right now so they will be paying their own expenses. We wanted to lighten up their financial strain by setting up a 24hr fundraiser stream.


Last 2 weeks ago, there were a lot of generous people that helped and donated to Psiyo to accommodate the expenses and be  able to compete at the Gamescom tournament. We hope to get the same generosity and help BM get to Gamescom too!


We will be randomly giving out **God Packs &amp; Gem Code Giveaways** for the viewers and supporters of this event! We need every bit of help we can get. To set a twist (*thanks to SK's idea*), we also thought of things to do when we reach a certain goal:


* **$100** - Youngbae does 20 push ups... topless.

* **$350** - Youngbae dyes his hair red

* **$500** - Youngbae dances to kpop

* **$750** - Youngbae kisses HirezBart on Gamescom stream

* **$1000** - Team Karaoke with all the BM Members (Poll on what songs to sing)

**STARTS @ AUG 2 - 10 PM CET / 4PM EST**

**ENDS @ AUG 3 - 10 PM CET / 4PM EST**


**http://www.twitch.tv/aimzzz**

(Other members from BM and friends would also stream but the main stream would be Youngbae's!)

**Where to donate:**

**Progress of the donation:**

1373678100.0,33,self.Smite,1i6yem,[Skill Set] Khepri - God of Rebirth (inspired by the artwork),Florburz,44,11,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1i6yem/skill_set_khepri_god_of_rebirth_inspired_by_the/,"INSPIRED BY [THIS ARTWORK](http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1i6jry/god_concept_khepri_god_of_rebirth/)

I saw this person's god concept for Khepri and I felt like designing a support/tank skill set for the god.  I feel the skills are really unique, and they might seem strange at first.  

**PLEASE: Give feedback about the concept, not the numbers.  Balance is secondary to hero theme and synergy.**

**Khepri - God of Rebirth**

* Pantheon - Egyptian
* Role - Support/Tank


**Innate - Scavenging**

*Being a scarab, Khepri is adept at utilizing the corpses of his enemies.  Walking over a recently slain enemy will heal Khepri and nearby allied gods equal to 0.5% of Khepri's max health.  Walking over the corpses of enemy gods heals a bonus amount equal to 10% of the slain god's health and grants Khepri a permanent boost to his protections.*

* Walking over creep corpses heals 0.5% of Khepri's health to Khepri and allied gods within a 30 foot AoE

* Walking over the corpse of an enemy god heals an extra 10% of that god's max health

* Creep corpses last for 5 seconds, god corpses last for 30 seconds (both allied and enemy gods drop corpses, not including Khepri).

* Khepri gains a permanent 2 to his protections for every god corpse he walks over.



**(1) Soul Link**

*Khepri sends a beam in a line, linking to the first enemy or allied god it hits.  Enemies have their movespeed and attackspeed drained into Khepri.  A portion of damage Khepri takes is transferred to the enemy instead.  If linked to an ally, Khepri shares all his healing with the ally and takes a portion of damage for them.*

* Drains 4/6/8/10/12% movespeed and attackspeed from the target

* Khepri takes 20% reduced damage, which is dealt to the target in the form of magic damage (meaning the original damage is reduced by Khepri's defenses as well as the enemy god's magic defense)

* If linked to an ally, 100% of Khepri's healing is added to his ally and Khepri will absorb 20% of damage for the ally (absorbed damage is dealt as non-lethal magic damage to Khepri, meaning it gets reduced by both Khepri's and the ally's magic protection)

* Lasts for 6 seconds when targeting an enemy (10 seconds on allies)


**(2) Scarab Swarm**

*Khepri surrounds himself with a veil of voracious scarabs, which devour the flesh of nearby enemies while also protecting Khepri.  While active, Khepri will heal based on the damage dealt by this skill.  If Khepri takes too much damage, the skill's effects end early.*

* Does 8/16/24/32/40 (+5% magic power) magic damage every 0.5 seconds to nearby enemies.  This ability has a passive 60% magic lifesteal (which is reduced to 20% because it is an AoE)

* The scarab swarm can absorb up to 75/150/225/300/375 (+50% magic power) damage for Khepri (calculated after protections)

* Lasts for 4 seconds


**(3) Latch On**

*Khepri latches onto the target enemy or ally.  While on an enemy, the target is crippled and disarmed (cannot make basic attacks).  While on an ally, Khepri adds his defenses to the ally and will block CC from the target.  Hitting the ally with hard CC will knock Khepri off instead of disabling the ally.*

* Enemies can be disabled for up to 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds

* Allies gain 60/70/80/90/100% of Khepri's protections and immunity from CC for up to 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds

* Hitting Khepri with a Stun, Mesmerize, Silence, Taunt, Knock-up, etc will knock him off early (applies to both enemies and allies).

* While Khepri is on an ally, he will block incoming shots which hit the side Khepri is on.

* Scarab Swarm can be cast while using this move.  Soul Link and Resurrection cannot be used.


**(Ult) Resurrection**

*Khepri attempts to revive the targeted ally.  If successful, the slain ally will have the option to revive where they died.  In addition, all other slain allies have their respawn times reduced.  This ability can be used while dead to reduce the respawn time of all allies instead.*

* As an AoE targeted skill (similar to using Loki's ult or Fenrir's 3), Khepri is CC immune and channels for 3 seconds.  After that, the target dead ally has a 5 second window to choose to revive; they revive once they accept the option.  If the ally declines, Resurrection goes on cooldown, but the timer is reduced by 50% (100~50 seconds)

* A directly revived ally recovers 100% of their health and mana and is CC immune for 3 seconds, but can be slain again for similar rewards

* Any non-targeted allies who are dead have their respawn timer reduced by 60/65/70/75/80% (of its current value).  This is also the effect if used while dead.

* 200/175/150/125/100 second cooldown.  If this ability is interrupted early in any way, the cooldown is reduced by 90%.

Again, please give constructive feedback about the concept.  I feel Khepri can play a unique support/tanking role for his teams, and can be extremely dangerous and hard to kill if played correctly.

**Changelog:**

*7/13: Increased Scavenging permanent buff per stack from 1 to 2.

* 7/12: Extended duration of Soul Link to 10 seconds for allies.  Soul link now causes Khepri to take 20% of damage instead of the linked ally.

Idea:

Once reached Mastery Level 1 on a God and the gold skin is purchased after every NEXT mastery level you gain an additional color to choose for the gold skin.

Example:

- Mastery level 2 = Green
- Mastery level 3 = Orange
- Mastery level 4 = Brown
- Mastery level 5 = White
- Mastery level 6 = Yellow
- Mastery level 7 = Purple
- Mastery level 8 = Grey
- Mastery level 9 = Red
- Mastery level 10 = Black

Once reached the mastery level you can choose the color you want to use for the match.

This would make the gods more customizable for the players.

-WARDS.  With teleport, you give yourself ample opportunity to get ganks in weird places.  Warding enemy speed or red give you a heads up, and possibly a steal and kill opportunity!  This is also a great reason to ward your **lane.**  If your enemies push a lot, ward behind them, and ask for a gank!  In this case, use regular wards in strange places for teleport opportunities, and sentry wards to fight for objectives!



-You can shoot firegiant from outside the lava range with carries and certain mages.  This will make the fights more frequent, as your team can take less damage from him overall.  Remember to counter-ward first!!  



-Every camp except for gold fury can be duo blocked as of 6/27.  Not sure if this is intended, but for now, start working on it!



-You can see certain particles through the fog of war.  Attacks and abilities.  If you see something spark in the distance, at a camp perhaps, then you'll have a steal opportunity.

She comes out of the jungle and 1 v 5s, 2 shots every body. This has happened in every single jungle Ne Zha game. Even after shutting her down early she becomes unkillable and out levels every player by 5-6 levels. Not to mention she has 2-5k more gold!

With most Moba communities giving smurfs a bad name I was wondering if we as a community could come up with some ""guidelines"" or etiquette for how to level through the lower lowers without hurting those new to the community and diminishing our potential player base.

So far I can think of:

1. **Be conscious of the fact these are new players**
   -These players can't be treated like they should know every god let alone even one god. These players are still new to the game and item builds might not be perfect.

2. **Try to help the new players**
   -Several times I've been asked how to do x or how didn't i die to y. Make sure to take the time to explain when you get the chance. Teaching them at lower levels will help to strengthen play at the higher levels. This also pertains to item builds, skill priority, etc.

3. **Be aware that the enemy team is also new**
   -If you can its probably best to try to play gods you don't know or play so well. This can be a great opportunity for both you and the new players to learn without blowing the enemy out of the water. Its important to remember there are 9 new players in a conquest game not just the 4 on your team and we would like to keep all of them interested in the game.

4. **Use and teach the VGS system.**
   -Far to often in low level games do I see people still typing in things like mias and even more often than that not knowing to call mias. Teaching someone the VGS system and when to use it can help them improve not only their play but the entire teams.

5. **Remember it is just a game.**
   -You are going to have people who rage, DC, etc at low level just like at high level. Try to keep things positive as a more experienced player. Letting people know that a rager or a DC isn't the end of the world is important. A lot of people get tired of the Moba community because of its acidic nature and hopefully we can help change that.

1361301192.0,35,self.Smite,18u0up,[MOD] THE BIG OL' YOU NEED TO READ THIS POST,LOWPOLYGOD,42,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/18u0up/mod_the_big_ol_you_need_to_read_this_post/,"Hello everyone! I'm LowPolyGod your new Lead Moderator here on /r/Smite. Sockless brought me in after stepping down as I manage one of the other popular MOBA reddits as well. Lots of things have been changing behind the scenes and will continue to change (hopefully for the better) over the coming weeks. The following are a few key points I want to touch base on:

1. **New Theme** — You should have noticed by now that the theme changed about a week ago. This is the new/minimal/less graphical theme here on /r/Smite. Sockless was working on this, but had to devote time to another project and didn't get to finish it. I've not finished it out and the light version will be EXTREMELY easy to finish.

2. **Updated Sidebar Information** — The MOTD, Free God Rotation, and FAQ are now located in the sidebar. These items have been made where they can be updated via text only. So this information should be up to date at all times. No more old MOTDs!

3. **Play For Free Referral Link** — We're running a test with the ""Play For Free"" button in the sidebar. It's currently using Sockless' referral link as a test for two reasons. One, I can ask him for the stats and see if it's even worth doing and how many referrals he's received in a month. Two, I kind of think he deserves it first for all the hard work he's done around here. The link will be changing monthly once we see if it's even worth doing. The new person's referral link will be chosen based upon our new Member of the Month criteria detailed below.

4. **Rules** — We've quickly revised the rules once since I've stepped in, but I've been further reviewing them and want to get them to more closely match the other MOBA reddits. For this reason I'm cutting them down even further and making some adjustments to how things run.

5. Be respectful, No personal information, Only one personal submission per day, No URL shortened links, No submissions where titles are the post, No images without blacked out names are being removed from the sidebar. Most of these are common sense and f all the offending posts I've reviewed none of these rules really come into play and they don't need to eat up sidebar space to drive the point home. (note: that your posts may still be removed for some of these reasons if it warrants it such as listing HiRezTodd's home address or something along those lines).

6. **Streams** — Do not link directly to your stream. You can post your stream once per day if you feel it's worth it to you to do so, but please make it a self post with the following information: link to your stream, your in game name, a brief description of who you are, what you play, and what kind of commentary will be discussed on the stream.

7. **Weekly Web Series** — As the rules stand now a WWS can make a single post promoting the show and then it goes in the sidebar. From this point on it's going to be a bit different. Each week you can make a post promoting your show, but again it needs to be a self post. It needs to detail what the show will be about, any special guests you may have, the time it will air, and a link to the show. The sidebar will be updated as needed according to these posts.

8. **Weekly/Monthly Tournaments** — The same thing applies to this as is does to the WWS above. Create a self post promoting your tournament detailing what teams will be involved, any prizes, time frames, link to the stream, and link to the websites / brackets.

9. **Wiki / FAQ / Guides** — We would like to flesh out all of these areas. We'll be allowing anyone to edit the global FAQ located in the sidebar. If you do so, please follow the contentions set forth in the FAQ and add your name after what you contributed like so (LowPolyGod). If you want to make a specific guide like ""Smite Terminology, God Ease of Use Guide, Dota 2 to Smite Guide"" please message the moderators and we'll set it up for you and link it in place. Doing any of the above will put you in running for the Member of the Month and prizes such as gems, skins, or giveaways.

10. **Member of the Month** — Contributing to /r/Smite via creating content for the FAQs, Wiki, Posts, or Comments will put you in the running for the member of the month. Each month the moderators will determine the winner. The winner will have their referrals link used in the sidebar allowing them to earn a small in game reward as well as; some type of skin or gem code for Smite. 

11. **Reporting Posts / Users** — We can only do so much. If you see a post you think violates the rules. Report it. See a user that is constantly toxic to the community? Report them. If you do report them send us a quick message so we know what's going on. We may not see what you see or if they get downvoted enough we way not see them at all. Help us by policing yourselves. If you don't see the [TAG] after the post that probably means a moderator hasn't seen the post yet.

12. **Looking for Team / More Posts** — We're working on a nice workaround for this. Until then we're allowing Look for Team posts to be made on /r/Smite. They will be amended with the [LFTeam] tags by the moderators. A LFMore post will be made daily by a moderator. Any informal LF posts should be made inside of this thread to find people to play with for the day.

13. **Vote Cheating** — A Reddit Admin has been making his rounds in the larger MOBA reddits condemning vote cheating. Which is the practice of manipulating votes via multiple accounts, getting friends to downvote a post, account bots, and a few other measures. This is a growing epidemic on Reddit and they are cracking down on it hard. If you're doing this please stop. You can view the posts on the Dota 2 and League of Legends Reddits. This is TL:DR version quoted directly from the Reddit Admin ""Vote cheating and manipulation of all types(as defined above) is becoming more prevalent in e-sports related subreddits. If you're doing this, stop now.""

14. **Team Flair** — Flair is getting revised soon. Team Flair will only be available if you finish in the top 5 in the Curse or MyRevenge tournaments. We'll use images we see fit to create the flair - if you're not a top 5 team don't bother asking for flair for your organization.

We'll be monitoring these changes to see how they are handled. If you have a problem with a certain type of post please report it. If you need to discuss something with us please use the ""message the moderators"" link in the sidebar. If everything goes well we'll see you guys at the end of the month for the monthly recap.",,False,,t5_2stl8,1361301589.0,,mod,True,t3_18u0up,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/18u0up/mod_the_big_ol_you_need_to_read_this_post/,

It only saved about a minute at the end (basically consisting of me kiting 2 enemies halfway across the map and my team cleaning up, although I did get a nice snipe kill), but, as I was on the Orange side of the map, the replay showed me using the Red version of Gold Ra, which I actually prefer to the Blue Gold version.

Now, with the backstory out of the way, here is my suggestion:
Have Gold skins change to either Red or Blue depending on if you are on the Insurgency or the Regime respectively (I don't know the official names for the sides.), instead of Blue for allies and Red for enemies. 

Obviously, this isn't a HUGE deal, and if my idea is ignored/shot down, I won't kick up TOO much of a fuss, but it's still something that I think could be considered, *at least as a toggle-able option.* I know a lot of people dislike Gold skins, but I know I, and others, like them.

This is going to be a weekly post for discussion. Mondays will be gods, Wednesdays will be items, and Friday is stupid questions (questions you feel dumb for asking but others can answer). Item discussion threads are for discussing when you should build said item, when you shouldn't, who you should build it on, who you shouldn't, counter to the item, and gods this item counters.

This is the first time I've done something like this so any feedback on what I can add to the OP will be appreciated. I would have linked something but couldn't find a proper site.

1363475965.0,32,self.Smite,1afnrx,Current SMITE Tournaments crippling the competitive scene for Europe?,Resterian,48,16,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1afnrx/current_smite_tournaments_crippling_the/,"[Possible jackass response detected: 'Team complaining they lost a tournament trollface.jpg'] 
No. Not at all. In fact, we haven't 'Won' anything.
No EU team has won for weeks.

Why is this the case? Are NA teams simply 'better'?

That's highly debatable, no-one can question the skill level of the current high profile European Teams such as Copenhagen Wolves and SK Gaming.

But they don't strictly 'Win'. We as EU competitors can sometimes pull off a 3rd or 4th place, but we don't get 1st or 2nd ; not in the weekly Curse or MyRevenge tournaments.

All anyone sees is ROOT or Curse scoring first place wins every week. Are they the best? They're good teams, no doubt worthy of their top-tier reknown, but as for the answer to that question, we can't know.

Why?

Because every time they're against a competitive EU team, the server is set to North American.

*""We havent had an EU server against any top NA team in any Curse tourney.""* - Sprayarn, Copenhagen Wolves

*""It's just such a joke that NA teams get favoured so much at the moment""* - Dradow, Team IIIII

*""I can't recall the last time I saw an EU team at the top of any tournament bracket""* - Vastrakal, Borderland Gaming EU

The way I see it, SMITE hasn't seen a significant rise in competitive European Teams compared to the American Circuit, which has far more teams vying for glory and, more importantly, those American Teams face far greater odds of performing well and getting the motivation needed to persevere compared to European Teams.

I see newly-formed European Teams take a shot at a Curse or MyRevenge tournament and two things happen;

One. As bottom seed they are placed against ROOT or Curse, who are usually #1 seed. As lower seed it is NA server.

Two. They're never heard from again.

And why should they come back? What is the point in even trying if new EU teams are set up only to fail due to impossible obstacles.

In a nut shell, NA teams are given the advantage every tournament which is affecting the end result. EU teams worthy of victory are constantly held back by 160-200ping.

I recall in the past in the early days of SMITE when you couldn't pick regions, NA teams would complain to a huge degree about EU server matches and, naturally, blame their losses on lag.

However, when us EU teams complain about this issue, it's more or less ignored or talked about with no action. 
And why would NA teams care? They're not in our position most of the time.

*""In all honesty I don't really pay attention to it.""* - Stermes, BLG NA

I suppose I wouldn't really expect them to be all that interested, it doesn't effect them afterall.

The point I'm trying to make I guess, is that European Smite is being crippled by the tournaments currently available, because realistically speaking, it's near impossible for an EU team to do well or even win.

I'd like to see region-based tournaments but sadly, because Europe is already crippled, the number of teams for a European Smite Tournament, don't even reach double digits.

*""It's so broken that NA teams are favoured.""* - Ephory, Worth It

Something has to change however, just -something- to even the odds because it's not fun for us EU teams when we always have to play our toughest matches at a big disadvantage.

Imagine a tall, skinny guy with an unreasonably large mane of curly hair, on his knees with his hands together;

However, it may mess up a few specific builds (Looking at you, Shielded Tank), or fun combinations for characters, such as Gem of Isolation on Thor (which surprisingly rocked in Arena).

This change is supposed to make it easier for new players to buy the correct items, however, this restricts more experienced players to use specific item builds as they can no longer buy those items. A possible solution would be to have an option in the settings where one can disable the ""only allow correct items to be bought"" feature.

This past weekend Hi-Rez Studios attended Rooster Teeth Expo, a gaming expo in Austin Texas based off of the popular group, Rooster Teeth!

However, my summation of the event is not why I'm here! There has been several comments about the event, both good and bad, as well as many posts showing concern, appraisal or criticism about the event.  Bart and I decided it would be a good idea to host an AMA (ask me anything) on the Smite game stream, twitich.tv/smitegame, starting at 3pm EST (i'll make sure Bart isn't late).

1368766935.0,28,self.Smite,1ei1jv,dmbrandon's Change Wishlist Part 1: Map Alterations and Mechanics,dmbrandon,69,41,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1ei1jv/dmbrandons_change_wishlist_part_1_map_alterations/,"Before we begin, I would like to note two items that must be considered for this list, before you begin reading:

1.  **Do not Cherry Pick.**  Do not go to your favorite god and read my change for him/her without reading the rest.  The changes are supposed to work in tandem to each other, and it's important that you take this in as a whole!

2.  I don't like nerfing.  Nerfing is generally taking away something that makes a character fun.  So, instead of nerfing, I will instead look to buff other characters in their weaker aspects.  Of course, some things need to be toned down, so I will address the major points.

(I have items to do, I know.  I'm just SO TIRED OF TYPING. OLOLOLOLO)  LET'S BEGIN.

    Map Changes!!

**Fire Giant:**
&gt;Fire Giant's placement and hitbox are moved up 10 feet.  Start up time on overhand smash increased by 18 frames.  (.3 seconds)

The movement does two things.  First, it allows Loki to get behind him for critical damage.  Importante!!  Secondly, it allows people to hide behind him and kite around him as an escape when being chased.  This will benefit players in two ways, itself.  First, more options of escape.  Two, AoE effects can't be used to burn players down near the unpulled Fire Giant, which makes Shielded Recall on that lane's players a more viable option when trying to escape in the jungle!  

The overhand smash was changed to allow gods to avoid the knockup damage and cc.  Gods lwith jumps may avoid, which will make them prime tanks for the initiation.  Odin comes to mind.

**Gold Fury**
&gt;Players tanking the Gold Fury will have their protections reduced by 20, and attack speed reduced by 25%.

It's a bit too easy for certain bruisers, and assassins to tank this god while sporting lifesteal, with no real threat.  This will ensure that tanks should be present before engaging. 

**Minotaur**
&gt;Minotaur will only regain 15% of his HP upon reaching his center station, and will only activate if pulled more than 20 feet from it's original location.

Stupid chain resets lololololo.


    Mechanics:

**Deminishing Returns:**
&gt;Upon third application of a CC of the same type (Stun, fear, mesmerize, silence, etc) within 6 seconds, the duration will be reduced to 50%.  That player will then be immune to that CC type for 6 seconds.  (This does not effect slow mechanics)

Too.  Many.  Stuns.  Fenrir jumps in, Aphro kiss, hand of the gods stun, Ragnarok pull's back into a Ymir...  The simple idea of DR should address this issue easily, and effectively, while keeping the core mechanics of teamfights intact.

**Basic Attack**
&gt;Mages now incur half the normal basic attack movement speed loss as tanks and physical Gods.  This does not apply to gods whose basic attacks scale with magic power, or are affected by magic power.  (IE:  Poseidon will lose this benefit when activating his Trident;  Isis will never gain this benefit.)

As of now, BA's are almost a detriment to mages.  That slow, especially when misclicked, and cost players lives, and sometimes games.  With this change, you'll be able to have a bit more control, and a tad bit more damage.

You can hold down spacebar by default and mouse over the items to see what was bought if you are using the autobuy.

* Similarly you can mouse over the skills and see all the stats (damage, cooldowns, cost, etc.). The relevant values are highlighted in a different color. if you hover over the picture of your god it will show the passive. These two tips are useful for quickly checking on stuff while not covering your screen with a big overlay.

* While you are mousing over you can move and strafe, making it nice to check on stats and skills while running back to battle.

* You must be in either the casual or competitive tabs to gain favor (in game currency). There is a first win of the day bonus worth 100 favor, and it is queue specific. Means if you get a win in assault, you can still get the 100 bonus for winning a game of arena or conquest.

My recommendation for new players is to play the tutorial, and then do a 1v1 against the bot. After that I would recommend either arena or assault. Assault will help you learn a lot of different champions kinda well as well as how to deal with towers and pushing and the like, while arena will let you focus on 1 champion in particular and also focus on teamfighting.

Also, I feel like a razer naga mouse (or other similar multibutton mouse) makes learning the game a lot easier, as it reduces the number of buttons your keyboard hand needs to worry about considerably. Right now all I have on the keyboard is wasd for movement, 1/2/3/4 for skilling up the appropriate skill, and q/e for active ablities. My skills and consumables are all on my mouse. If anybody wants to share a 2 button mouse appropriate keybindings, or any other noob answers please feel free to add them in the comments.

1364240082.0,31,self.Smite,1azpgh,God Idea: Zhong Kui - Chinese Vanquisher of Ghosts and Evil.,mBlakew,36,5,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1azpgh/god_idea_zhong_kui_chinese_vanquisher_of_ghosts/,"Was brushing up on my mythology and ran across this guy. Figured Smite is due for another Chinese God.

Zhong Kui is the vanquisher of ghosts and evil beings. He commands demons. His role in the Chinese mythology is to hunt, capture, and command all of the ghosts of Hell. More can be found on Google or wikipedia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhong_Kui

Here's my attempt to make him viable in Smite. Suggestions welcome!

Zhong Kui would be a melee role. Maybe bruiser / support?

His whole story / role is the pursuit of evil / vanquishing evil. Thus he kit includes a plethora of slows in varying degrees to help his pursuit. This may lean him more towards the support role than physical carry. 

Passive - After killing a minion the minion is resurrected as a ghost under the command of Zhong Kui. This can occur more than once every 15/25 seconds. Minions health / damage scale with game duration. Not applicable on Fire Giant / Gold Fury. Max of 4 minions OR minions last 10 seconds / until killed.

OR 

Passive - Killing a minion or enemy god grants Zhong Kui an apparition charge in his soul well. These apparitions enhance his abilities to do more damage / added effects OR are required to active his abilities.

Ability 1 - Ghost Wave - Zhong Kui summons a wave of apparitions from Hell to damage enemies in a circle around him, doing X damage and leaving behind corrupted soil, somewhat slowing enemies in it by % for 2/2/3/3/4 seconds. While on corrupted soil Zhong Kui moves % faster.

Ability 2 - Ghastly Sacrifice - Zhong Kui minions swarm around him. Anyone who hits Zhong Kui while Ghastly Armor is active is slowed by % for 1/1/2/2/3 seconds. A portion of the damage dealt to Zhong Kui is dealt back to attacking enemies.

Ability 3 - Blades of Hell - Zhong Kui summons two ghastly blades to attack his foes. Blades act independently of one another and can attack different foes. Each blades does X damage + a % of his physical power and slightly slowing enemies hit by %. Lasts 2/3/3/4/4 seconds.

OR

Ability 3 - Blade of Judgement - Zhong Kui lashes out in a cone dealing X damage to enemies and slowing them by % for 1/1/2/2/3 seconds. (Maybe corrupt the soil in front of him?)

Ability 4 - Hell's Judgement - The soil around Zhong Kui becomes one with Hell, allowing ghosts figures to drastically slowing enemy movement by % and reducing all protection by %. Zhong Kui gains % movement to pursue his enemies while moving on this ground. Lasts X seconds. 

This is really the first time I've sat down and thought a God out. Let me know what you think. 

Figured it would be fun to detail the changes of the God based on player feedback.

Edit 1: Changed passive to include a cap on minions / possibility of 10 sec duration. Reduced occurring duration from 20/30 to 15/25.

Edit 2: Reduced slow duration on Ability one. From 2/3/4/5/6 to 2/2/3/3/4

Edit 3: Added slight slow to Blades of Hell.

Edit 4: Changed name of Ability 4. From Ghosts of Hell to Fields of Hell.

Edit 5: Added possibility of bruiser support god increase of melee dmg god. 

Edit 6: Added an alternative passive that utilizes a ""soul well"". Did not change abilities to reflect this passive.

Edit 7: Changed Ability One from a straight line to a circle effect around him. Changed Ability two to have a slow when hit by enemies / reworked it to be more in line with his overall kit. Added a possible Ability 3. Changed name of Ability 4 to fit lore more closely.

Seeing as how the last ""Open Discussion"" topic I posted had a lot of feedback (and I loved reading all of it) I'd like to bring up another point of discussion. **Warning: semi-long post again**

Myself and a few others from Hi-Rez Studios recently went to QuakeCon where we partnered up with Alienware and had a booth for some casual tournaments and walk up play. During this weekend a decent amount of fans from Smite would walk up and talk with us, and outside of a few people that were around my age (23) majority of them had to still be in high school. 

It BLEW my mind that there were so many young SMITE fans that took the game rather seriously. When I was that age the only game I ever took relatively seriously was Soul Calibur 2 and Dance Dance Revolution (*yes, yes... I know*) and I never traveled for it, nor took a serious part in the community.

So that brings me to my main point of discussion...

**How does age impact the quality and quantity of competitive gaming?**

Do you think that age is no longer as restrictive as it once was? Do you feel that those that are younger are simply not as good as older competitors or vice versa? Or has gaming simply became a more accepted community in the general public to allow their children to focus on it as a **sport/hobby**?

When I was interning at a high school to become a teacher (*yes, yes... I know*) I visited a lot of classrooms to simply observe how the teachers managed their students/classrooms. In one of these classrooms they had to write/post on the wall what they were going to focus on after high school and why. Out of the near 70 pieces of papers posted I immediately focused on what appeared to be an image of MLG Orlando (which I went to previously). Of course I immediately read the paper to find out that the kids life goal was to be a competitive gamer or to work in the eSports scene. 

I was so confused but delighted that there was someone that was actively wanting to ""Grow up and be a professional gamer"" to the point that they'd write a publicly posted paper about it. Never in my years of high school did I ever see anyone post anything like that.

**I'd love to hear every ones opinions and stories of how age affected them in the Gaming scene.**

So as his ult is activated, pizza slices will be removed from the pan (same amount of slices just as the same amount of tiles).

It was started in March of 2011 by two friends, DrMath (James) and Legit (Stan), to be a gaming-centric community focused on a providing friendly atmosphere, a sense of family, and a team passionate for gaming free, of the drama of bloated structures and politics that often comes with it. Zealot Gaming was to be an open community where everyone had a say, where nothing was kept from members. In order to help ensure this cause was realized, a motto was adopted that stated the three core values that would be sought after in each member; Fidem. Integritate. Zelum.

The first, Fidem, is Latin for loyalty and fidelity. Zealot Gaming is a home for gamers who will not only be loyal to their game, but their clan and fellow clanmates. Fidem imparts a sense of honor and kinship to your fellow gamers within the clan that ensures a healthy environment where all members can learn, grow, and most importantly enjoy gaming. This is represented by the blue color of the dragon in the emblem, symbolizing loyalty and fidelity. It imparts a calm, cool, and collected attitude, something we wish the find in all of our members. It reminds us all that upon joining, we join not just some rag-tag bunch, but a community, a family, who we should pledge our loyalties too, fostering its growth and seeking to make it better where we can.

Itegritate, Latin for integrity, is a core component of members in Zealot Gaming. The highest standard of behavior is expected of our members both in and out of game. With our strict no cheating policy, our members are expected to maintain good standing in all games they play as well as with their fellow clanmates and the gaming community as a whole. Maturity is a key component in this value, and something we expect to see in our members. This is represented by the pearl the dragon surrounds, a symbol of purity, honesty, and integrity, our second value. A pearl start as a grain of sand in a mussel which is then built upon, creating brilliant layers around it until the strong pearl emerges from the mussel, fully formed. It is unwavering, and should be thought of as a symbol of our good standing with each other, as well as with the communities of gamers we play with everywhere. We hold ourselves to a higher standard of conduct than that of irritating players with child-like attitudes online. The pearl asks us to pause and reflect upon our own behavior to ensure we uphold the integrity of the clan.

Finally, Zelum, Latin for zeal, the value which our clan has taken as its namesake, conveys passion, fervor, and desire. It inspires our members to be enthusiastic about gaming and the clan, to be diligent in their endeavors, and to allow their inner fires to shine through, acting as a beacon for fellow gamers to follow their shining example and to imitate their arduous spirit. This is represented by the dragon, which serves as a powerful statement, and symbolizes fire, passion, strength, and zeal. It represents the ferocity we all have inside us, and our burning passion to find the fun in gaming and dedicate ourselves to it. In different cultures it has symbolized expansion and growth, as well as an ability to see the “big picture”, something we hope our members can all do. The dragon also symbolizes wisdom and longevity, two things we hope that the clan and its leaders possess.

Zealot Gaming is growing daily, and with over a year of experience under its belt and nearly 360 active members it promises to continue to grow. The clan has by now established itself as a home for gamers who will be loyal to its values and seek to embody them in their gaming experiences. The close bonds formed by our members speak for themselves, and speak to the quality and character of the community that has established itself here. The only question to ask yourself is will you become a part of its history?

1368828720.0,26,self.Smite,1ejm5s,"Can we please get player names ""released"" from inactive accounts?",asylumsaint,44,18,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1ejm5s/can_we_please_get_player_names_released_from/,"Hello!

I had recently tried contacting HiRez about this issue.  What issue you might ask?  Plenty of names are locked to peoples accounts who haven't played more then 1 game in over a year.  Why is this problem?  Some people much like myself, have specific gaming names they use from game to game.  For those of us who stream under these names, have friends under these names, and a reputation with the name. It makes it extremely annoying.

Assuming, a few things, I feel it should be easily possible to do this, while being fair.

Players under level 5, or evel level 10, who have not played in over say, 6-8months.  Probably don't plan on returning anytime soon.  (While I can't speak for all of them, we can assume many of them won't)  Some may be waiting for release.

I feel that, as long as the account hasn't had any gem purchases, is under level 10 or 5, and hasnt played in 6-8 months.  Their names should be ""released"" should a current and active player request it.

This practice isnt something new.  It's been done by a just about every single MMO (WoW, Rift, and others) its also been done by another Moba game.  League of Legends.   

This idea not only helps players like myself who are stuck using a different name, due to an inactive account. (in my case the account has 2 total matches played, and is a year old.  Only reason I didn't get the name was he joined 3 days before me)

This also generates money for HiRez. 

In theory, if 1 out of every 10 players, has a different name then they wanted, and say, 5 out of every 10 players who dont have their name, are lost to inactive accounts,  if all those players were to buy 400 gems for the name change, thats a good chunk of the total player base buying gems for the name change.

For me, that seems like a win win.

It makes more sense to me, to take care of, and cater to your current active players, then to gamble with the chances of a returning inactive player.

What are your guys thoughts on this?

Example:

This was from when I played World of Warcraft, here is a support ticket I did, one of many, to request names to be unlocked.

So apparently I need to clarify this since many people do not understand.

1365343299.0,29,self.Smite,1buost,PSA: This is how Trueskill works (matchmaking),fabric9,33,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1buost/psa_this_is_how_trueskill_works_matchmaking/,"Recently I've seen a lot of complaints about being matched against players with 2000 games played, etc, so I thought I'd try to make an informative post about why that's not really relevant (it is, it's just not the most relevant stat).

Trueskill tracks two numbers, lets call them μ and σ. μ is the average skill of a gamer (some might call this *elo* or *rating*), whilst σ is the uncertainty of that skill. As you play more and more games σ goes towards a minimum value. That is to say, the more games you play, the more certain the system becomes of your average skill actually being μ.

If you win, your μ rises. If you lose, your μ drops. How big that change is depends on the value of σ (bigger σ leads to a bigger chance in μ). Your σ *never* rises however, it only goes down with every game played. That is to say, your rating may fluctuate, but the system becomes more and more certain of your rating with every game you play.

[Source material from Microsoft](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/) - basically what I've rewritten in my own words above, what Hirez used to base their system on. There are some separate rules that apply only to SMITE (for example how parties work, and how the new μ is calculated with stuff like KDA in mind), but that's the basics to their matchmaking system.

**ADDENDUM: MY THEORY**

I believe this is the reason you see that gamer with a low amount of games played matched up with/against another gamer with a high amount of games played. The system thinks they have the same skill (the same μ), even though one of their σ is tiny whilst the other is still huge. Obviously the system *tries* to match a similar μ *and* a similar σ, but this is not always possible. The fewer people that queue, the more likely it is that someone with high uncertainty (σ) gets dropped in with someone with low uncertainty (σ), because the system puts priority on matching a similar skill (μ) first, when it has to.

Xbalanque used his jump to harass? (btw, that's why you should max 2) Well you can just Belly Flop on him and beat him up. Agni wasted his dash to farm? Now is your time to stealth and hop on him Loki.

After 50~ish times having to check trough every wiki page just to see the cooldowns of a god, I figured it might be just easier to put it into all-in-one bundle.

on today's menu: Item Cost -&gt; Benefit

=================================================

**A Brief Overview**

=================================================

* I will be referring to item upgrades as Tiers (total of 3 tiers) - T1, T2, T3. In the spreadsheet it shows L1, L2, L3.

* The new item from the last patch has not yet been added into this pool.

* All costs will be referred to as total cost unless noted otherwise. This means that if I say T2 = 1000g, that *includes* the price of the T1. (i.e. boots of Celerity T1 450, T2 1000, T3 1900)

* The average cost of a T1 item is 741. Low - 420g Magi's Blessing. High - 1010g for Book of Thoth.

* Weight refers to the stats allocated to a particular item - This helps for more direct comparisons because we can simplify the classes to certain stats.

=================================================

Link to Google Docs: [SMITE Item Averages](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvFUbNYB513mdDY0ckwtTU5SOGVGYnlhUnVrQWJLbGc)

If you see an error in the Items sheet, let me know. Otherwise, the sheet you want to be looking at is Averages.

=================================================

**In a Nutshell... (tl;dr)**

=================================================

* You pay *LESS* for a T2 than a T1. This means that the more T1 items you have, the more you are wasting your gold.

* You pay *MORE* for a T3 than a T1 or T2 (unless it has no passive).

* The game intends to reward you for fully upgrading an item (items without passives are less expensive than T1 or T2, items with a passive are more expensive).

* The stats on these items compared to their gold costs (on average) are somewhat justified. Some items give way too much of a stat comparatively (example: Reinforced boots give the absolute most HP5) If I can ever figure out how to do conditional formatting on Google Docs I could make it easier to see visually.

* The item design is not good for this genre. Builds are stagnant and the attempt to use Ability items to fill the void between expensive upgrades and mid game itemization is not sufficient.

* Unrelated but worth saying: Girdle of Might (Ability) is terrible in its current form.

* Sorry in advance if some parts of this don't make sense... Just ask a question and I'll clarify it. It's a long post and I wasn't able to get to everything in one sitting.

=================================================

**The Analysis**

=================================================

There are a few patterns we can identify in this data almost immediately, just by looking at gold cost and knowing how that T1 = low stats, T3 = high stats:

* You pay *LESS* for a T2 than a T1. This means that the more T1 items you have, the more you are wasting your gold. If the Average price of a T1 is *741* and the average price of a T2 is *1454*, you are paying *713* for T2 items. This upgrade to T2 is generally a substantial increase in stats. For example, a Book of Thoth (which has no passive @ T3) costs 1010g T1, 1970 T2. This item provides Mana (25&gt;75), Magical Power (30/65), and Mana regen (5&gt;10). You gain significantly more mana at T2 and 5 extra MP and pay 50 less gold for the T2 upgrade than the initial T1 purchase. This is a moderate example, but clearly shows the case for all T1&gt;T2 purchases.

* You pay *MORE* for a T3 than a T1 or T2 (unless it has no passive). A lot of other people have made the argument that the passive @ T3 makes it necessary to fully upgrade an item before making another purchase and I'm not really here to tell you any different. You should take the overall average with a grain of salt, however, because items with no passives seem to be less expensive at T3 than T1 or T2 (see Book of Thoth). All in all, you pay 2423 (or upgrade from T3 for 969) on average for a T3 item.

What does this mean? Well, it's clear that the design principle is to reward you for upgrading an item. However, in MOBA games (especially DOTA), item builds are very dynamic and necessary to change and adapt to the game. There are no active items in SMITE (Ability items do not apply in this conversation because their functionality / weight are different. They are basically LoL summoner spells that you can buy and mix up each game), so balancing comes down to novel/utility vs flat stat increases.

**Is it balanced, though?** This is tricky to answer. Some passives might need tweaking in the future, but if you're talking about total gold cost to stats, then yes, it's fairly balanced when you consider the resources necessary to complete an item. Some items are significantly better at a particular stat but cost is generally higher because they mix in below average other stats (except for Reinforced Boots which is waaaay too much HP5 or too cheap). But this isn't what I wanted to pose as a problem. I understand that items can always find unintended and wildly successful uses (re: Mystical Mark stacking in the early game), and nerfing those uses / tweaking stats can be challenging with more and more novel uses (*cough* I really hope they adjust Gem of Isolation and Frostbound Hammer). It's possible to get an idea of their item budget for each stat and how they picked their gold costs, but the intent of this post isn't to number crunch but rather to examine the design.

**Is it good design?** No. Well, at least I don't think so. Everyone is entitled to their opinion on this, but I'll try to sway you to my side with these words and numbers.

=================================================

**The Main Point**

=================================================

Part of the problem can be attributed to just not having enough items in the game. In fact, my main concern can be remedied fairly easily and I'll leave a few suggestions for it here as well.

We get 1500 gold at the start of each game - this is enough for T2 boots + potions, T1 + T1 + potions, or T1 + Ability + potions. Most people stick to items rather than abilities (unless they're jungling) because they want those stats early on. My guess is that the generous 1500 is given at the start so that players could purchase some ability items right at the start, that way they can have on-use items or just simply their LoL style Summoner Spells. If that was the design intent, they failed to create the items around it in a way that would make ability items attractive at the start.

In DOTA(2), there are a lot of items in the game that are considered 'early game' items that have significant use for low gold costs but are intended to be sold back as the game progresses, allowing the players to essentially always keep their inventory full. This is notably influenced by the gold penalties on death, but is still food for thought. SMITE took a different approach by borrowing the shop idea from Rise of the Immortals and using League of Legends for designing the stats. Instead of making any item for the early game, all items are meant to start of as 'early game' and then upgrade up into the rest of the match.

In LoL, there are only a handful of early game items (Doran's Ring/Shield/Blade) and then several mid-game items (Brutalizer, Hexdrinker, Hextech Revolver, etc). They put in some items that you cannot upgrade at all and must sell (Doran's + a small handful of low cost high utility, Chalice (before Athene's was added), Haunting Guise, etc) to get better items later on. Arguably, the only item worth selling back is Midas' Boots in SMITE. The boots offer no combat utility and the only stats on them are nearly insignificant.

**But why does this mean it's bad design?** Because once you buy a T1 item you are essentially stuck with it. The Cost -&gt; Benefit of T1 items vs T2 is clear. The most dynamic builds you can do are simply responses to what your opponents are building / who on the team will give you the most trouble. There are no temporary quick-fix items to help you if you're playing a squishy carry and you find yourself in need of some HP and damage quickly. If you have more than 2x T1 items by the 5 minute mark you are basically wasting gold that would get you to a T3 passive. If you have more than 2x T2 at any point you are simply wasting gold by not completing one of them to T3 first. The attempt to fill the void of mid-game utility items with Ability items is rough - Aegis and Purity beads are common mid purchases but are situational. I don't think T2 passives are the right way to address this, but something's gotta give. Every deity has some form of utility built in already (Another post in the future will discuss mechanics and how some **cough** jump/leap **cough** are broken), so the mid game becomes all about amplifying those through either damage or survivability.

Some items need to be nerfed hard because of their utility/stats being too useful/high (Reinforced Boots tops the list for stat to gold nerf when compared to all other items of its class). Some items need to be buffed because of underuse (read: they're not useful). But more importantly, the conflict of interest between buying Abilities and Items should be addressed because that is the logical place to look for why they chose to design all items as being end game items.",,False,,t5_2stl8,1342336907.0,,sobek,True,t3_wkayr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/wkayr/ive_been_putting_this_off_for_a_while_but_its/,

1373179386.0,28,self.Smite,1hsisl,Details about what happened during the showmatch at RTX. All opinions are my own.,davidsee,37,9,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1hsisl/details_about_what_happened_during_the_showmatch/,"Album from today here: http://imgur.com/a/zNwWR

Hey all, DavidC1 here. Let's get the first disclosure out of the way - I work for Alienware and I play a ton of Smite. I am writing this as a fan of the scene and as someone who was in attendance. What I write below are my opinions and in no way representative of my employer or HiRez.

Second, as a Smite fan, it was a tough match to watch today for both teams because it could have swung either way due to certain factors out of the control of any of the players or HiRez.

You probably didn't see this on stream but the DCs that you guys saw weren't actually DCs - the entire showmatch was riddled with technical difficulties from the beginning due to the computers that they were running. The match was played on the new Razer Blade 14 laptops which weren't equipped to handle an event of this nature. Razer was a premier sponsor for RTX so HiRez had no say in what equipment was being used on the main stage during the match. 

The Blade 14 is a sexy ass laptop - even I'll admit that. However, that thing runs way too hot considering the components inside that small frame. In this specific case, the laptops were driving each front display for the fans to see, the players' own monitor, as well as a third video capture feed for the stream/projector. Even for LoL, we provide Aurora desktops to maintain the level of performance expected of a professional match like this where $$$$ is on the line. Again though, I don't believe HiRez had a say in this. 

If you look at my album of photos from earlier today, from photos 3 to 4 the staff was already sorting out issues with the video display before the matches had begun. They were simply overheating from driving that much video - to the point where they had to prop up the notebooks just to help with venting. These GPU issues were what caused people to see all-black Sobek and hot-pink Neith, the GPUs were beginning to show artifacts and drop textures. 

Throughout the match, the guys had to deal with really choppy frame rates, which you all know makes a huge difference. On top of that there were issues with Windows 8 that kept bringing up the task bar randomly and even worse, the issues with ShadowQ and Shing getting stuck on the Windows 8 activation screen. Like I said, it was really tough to see the guys getting thrown off like this and the winner could have gone either way with a single poorly-timed crash. Unfortunately in this case, it happened to Omega at the start of match 3. His crash was the worst of the bunch as his entire system essentially locked up due to thermal throttling and actually did a full 90º screen rotation for some reason. It was honestly a crappy way to win and I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone in a match like this.

To those using this as an example for the need for pause - again it wouldn't have made a difference here. Even with pause, any of these guys' game clients could have crashed at any moment and everyone was really just trying to do the best that they could at the time. To those taking issue with the 10:02 concede from Snipe, yes it was unfortunate but I don't blame them. It was a poor experience for the players and while continuing would have been nice for the fans, it would have only continued to feature the hardware problems that plagued the showmatch.

Just my two cents here on the event. RTX was a big boost for Smite in my opinion and I hope it helps them take another step in growing the game. 

Looking forward to the NA tournament next weekend where these guys should be back in their usual setups without the hiccups.

Besides playing SMITE which he coincidentally works for, but has no clue how to play, he answered a few questions about the game. You can find them here (in German!) http://www.unabhaengige-tester.de/?p=5884

And I kinda guess that most of you don't speak it, so here is an english translation :) Please keep in mind that I did not ask the questions, but the viewers did. 

- HiRez is thinking about what you can spend your favor on. One of the ideas could be exclusive Skin-packs, only purchasable with favor.

- Every god will have a goldskin.

- In future patches a lot of items will have a expanded tier 3 setting. You can see it right now for Ankh of the bear which was included accidently in the last patch. It wasn't on purpose, because they are still testing around. But the community liked it and more items will have a new passive and other stats.

- It's not a priority right now, but you will be able to mute different voice packs, if you don't like them.

- After the games release there will still be new gods on a biweekly basis.

- The game will be translated in different languages, as you can see with Tribes (French, German, Spanish and so on)

- The elo system is getting reworked constantly and as of now you will probably keep your Elo when game is out of beta. But they are not sure on it and might do a poll in that regard.

- Level 30 is the highest level. You can now get Mastery Level.

- After release the maps will have different themes, like Halloween or Christmas seasonal and probably different ones alltogether, to mix it up.

- Bumba's Mask stays in the game. It will get reworked until we are satisfied with it.

- Since the last patch you are able to copy + paste stuff.

-  The game will be free of charge forever.

I wished to create this message to bring an issue that much people have noticed to the attention of the developers. However, before hand, I would like to clarify a few things, especially to avoid being mis-understood : I'm highly impressed by Hi Rez's capacity of creating new gods and new content in such short timespan, and of listening to the community on several different matters. It's not always an easy thing for developers, especially since feedbacks are often opposed to each other.

However, I noticed a problem slowly creeping up on the game since the last patches : glitches. Overall, the game seems to have gotten glitchier and glitchier during the last weeks/months. People always ask for more content, but fixing glitches is just as important, and with recent content, there has been an increasing number of bugs, that haven't been fully fixed and that stack up.

Of course, Hi Rez know what they're doing, but we've already seen in the past some ""huge"" glitches that they hadn't noticed during several weeks, that no-one talked about, despite their presence. Thus the reason of this post.

As for the glitches, I couldn't make a full list of them. Some don't affect me, some do, and overall I haven't noted them all of course, so please feel free to contribute to this post if you have some to point out, although the goal is not to make a list of bugs.

Some really ""old"" bugs are still present, and are in great need of being fixed. For example, Vamana's ult being unable to be cancelled if it lasts longer than its initial duration (via the passive that makes it last longer when hit). Bakasura's 2 not healing from time to time. And numerous others that I couldn't list.

Some other ""new"" glitches are also present, such as the many ""deserter status"" issues after the Isis patch, still not fully fixed from what I've seen, more and more lag issues (rubber banding, even with low ping, making you teleport on very short distances when you strafe quickly), the aegis delay that many people noticed a few weeks ago, given the feedback I had on my post about this, that has still not be resolved, and so on.

Other more weird bugs, certainly less reported, such as Odin's leap sometimes teleporting him directly to the location of the landing, without having the long animation for the leap, making it faster.

Overall, I'm not doing Hi Rez isn't doing anything : they do fix bugs, they do add content. But maybe they should add less content in the upcoming weeks, and focus fully on totally fixing all these issues. They are stacking up more and more, which honestly makes me slightly afraid for Smite's future, as I know how this can quickly escalate, being a developer myself.

It's been a busy time since the last update (mostly due to the holidays), but we've finally been able to refine and work on additional features to /r/Smite. Please read below for details about new features and a few new rules here on our little slice of Reddit.

**Dark Theme Revisions and Light Theme** — The Dark theme has undergone quite a few revisions making it 100% compatible with Reddit Enchantment Suite, as well as, a few minor tweaks to readability and flow of information. The light theme is in progress and should be finished soon (a theme switcher will appear on the sidebar when it goes live).

**Flair** — You asked for it and we listened (hard to believe right?) You can select flair on sidebar near the very top just under the subscribe/unsubscribe button. You can select from your choice of god, as well as, display your username or god name to the right of the flair. ***Any URLs or extremely long messages will be in violation of the flair act of 2013 and will be changed via moderation tools. We'll warn you a few time, but after that you might have to deal with harsher consequences.***

***Update:*** *Team Flair has been added - go support your favorite team! Let me know if I've missed any major teams.*

**Mode of the Day** — The current mode of the day is now displayed to the right. This should be updated each morning.

**Free Week Gods** — The 5 permanent and 5 temporary free week gods are now displayed in the ""This Week In Smite"" area of the sidebar. These should be updated every patch to keep everyone informed of which gods are currently free.

**Reddit Enhancement Suite** — I wanted to touch base on this again, because we actually installed RES and made sure all of the features not only work - but look nice while using this very popular Reddit addon (sorry for not listening last time).

**In the future...** we'll be adding even more great features. We're currently looking at ways to allow streamers to post their streams daily without cluttering up the frontpage of /r/Smite. We're also in the early stages of creating a LFG/LFM/LFT tool which any Redditor can use to find a group when needed. With the introduction of the new Reddit Wiki System we'll also be creating our own gods database here on Reddit which you can easily link to, as well as, find crucial information about any god.

***Minor tweaks to the theme, icons, and colors will be made over the coming days as bugs are brought to our attention.***

Thanks — /r/Smite Moderation Team

So I will be creating a new website to help support this game. I will give you the basis of what will be (or will be soon after release) all ready implemented and based on that I would like input of things you would like to see.

*Hero Builder (will be implemented)-
There are some sites out there now that have this, however I dont think they do it as well as it should be. Some added stats will be Effective/Magical/Physical HP among with other stuff.

*Game Mechanics (will be implemented)-
At what rate does Hades pull someone with ult? How much does 100 physical and/or magical protection protect me against? General questions people may have that really dont have a ""place to get all the answers""

*Fan section (soon after release, pending certain things)-
Art contests, video contests, ect. I enjoy creating a place where community ideas can come to life and people get recognized for thus ideas.

*Personal Section (will be implemented)-
I love creating items/abilities/""Gods"", I like it better when I actually explain the process behind everything and love going into detail. This is the way that game designers do this process. How it fits, look, ""feel"", sound, the whole nine yards

*Stat Page (soon after release, pending certain things) -
Another place to go to look at stats. This however is pending how I can gain this information (havent looked into this quite yet).
Damage charts of matches (graphs so you can really show off your e-pen...)


About Me - You can Skip this part and just comment on what you think should be implemented.

I have created Contests before that either I personally pay for, or get Developers in on. In Hon, I created contest for concept art for the heros I created. Back when I used to play Dawn Of War, I created many contests for other sites that even got backed by Relic. Most notably the Custom map design contest that the winner got their map implemented in the game itself. I have sponsored/got sponsored for lan parties in my local area (very minor sponsors I might add).

This will be the first site that I have ever created from the ground up, and for now I am the only one working on it. You will most likely see this site up and running more towards then end of Jan 2013.",,False,,t5_2stl8,False,,,True,t3_12xe35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/12xe35/new_website_want_input/,

I still think the game is amazing and addictive, but this is one thing I've wanted to say.

I feel each god should be built around a specific method of playstyle and there should be another god out there that can counter this god's playstyle. For example, Anubis is all about hitting like a truck, but he has to stay still to do so. Ra is all about high damage too, but requires a stationary target. What this means is that Anubis absolutely needs to face Gods which have more AoE+low dmg than gods that do high single target damage. They need to be balanced this way. But gods like Poseidon are too hybrid - high mobility, high single target damage, high CC and high AoE. He's not built for a specific purpose and is instead all encompassing. 

Take Odin for example. He's meant to be more for utility, a bruiser who can damage if needed while being sturdy as it is. His 2 and his ultimate do not directly damage anyone. Sure, they may trap people, but as anyone who's played Odin will know, people can come often come out unscathed after a full 4sec in the ultimate. He was meant to aid other players to land their hits or protect them. If he went up against Zeus, Zeus could just keep landing charges and can use his own ult to counter Odin's ult. Both of their ults should be used in the right place at the right time. Or else they're going to be wasted. NOW compare this to Tyr, who can knockback, heal, damage and has an AoE, CC immune, jump ulti that does nasty damage. All while maintaining a good amount of HP and being a jungler if necessary. He does not have a counter/anti-Tyr to him. 

Now take a solo laner for example. Vulcan is someone who can defend towers damn well (thank you boatmurdered for an awesome guide) and can dish out damage to most dumb players. But there is a clear downside to him. The placed turrets destroy minions and peel enemy gods who try to be daring and come close. But once your turrets are placed, your hand is revealed. So any god like Hun Batz, who can leap over the turrets, quickly throw a monkey to close the gap and start getting hits. But if he misses his jump or monkey, he'll take a beating from Volcanic Overdrive and Backfire. He can't do shit for melee attacks once he's in the Overdrive Thumper's range because of its slow. Now compare it to Fenrir. Missed his jump (which can stun)? Lol, let me use Brutalize then. Fuck, did he still get away. No problem, let me fetch him with my ult. The kit is just too damn diverse. Fenrir can't be built for monster damage AND monster mobility. He should either be high damage-low mobility or vice versa. 

My point is, the kits need to stop being so open and accommodating. They need to be more tailored to a specific playstyle. If you're playing Anubis or Zeus, you know that if you're caught out of position you're melted within seconds, regardless of your ultimate. But if you're Apollo or Fenrir or Tyr or Chang'e? Their ultimates will help them escape AND deal a ton of damage if necessary.

I just wanted to touch base on a few things in regards to /r/Smite.

##New Filters

We took the results of the poll from a few days ago asking what content you like to see on /r/Smite and created group filters. These new filters will allow you to see more of the content that is important to you while hiding some of the more boring and fluff pieces. To start using a filter simply mouseover the ""Filter Content"" link below the Smite logo and select your filter.

- **No Fluff** - This is for people who enjoy the more serious side of the game. It focuses on discussion and theorycrafting. This filter hides artwork, videos, streams, misc, help, and suggestions.

- **News** - This filter will only show you announcements, mod posts, and new content.

- **Competitive** - E-Sports! E-Sports! E-Sports!

- **All Media** - This filter will only show you artwork, videos, and streams. All other content will be hidden.

- **No Media** - Works the opposite of ""All Media"". This filter will show you the default listings minus artwork, videos, and streams.

- **Improvements** - This filter is for people who want to help Hi-Rez improve the game, as well as, improving other players experiences. This filter will only show help and suggestion posts.

*If you have a suggestion for a new filter, please leave it in the comments below.*

**Edit: Filters work with both the light and dark themes now. No more switching to light them when clicking them!**

##Team Flair

CtrlAltDefeated has updated the team flairs. Enjoy! We're sticking with the top 5 NA / EU teams per the E-Sports website for the moment.

##Sticky Posts

Sticky Posts should now be easily identifiable and fall more inline with the overall theme for all posts. We're also toying with the idea of allowing posters to assign their own link flair (we'll see).

##Newest God Added to Header

Something I'm playing around with. I've added the newest god to the header of /r/Smite. I'm not sure he's staying yet, but I might have a few nice ideas for the header.

##/r/Smite Stats

**Play-A-PUG / Demigod Challenge**

**What?**

Series of events in order to generate interest in competitive / high level Smite. Taking part in these weekly PUGs will allow you to take part in the Demigod Challenge.

**Who?**

Anyone. Yes, that means anyone... Veteran players, total noobs, mediocre players... we want you all to take part in this event.

**When?**

Saturdays at 9PM EST (starting ~~September 15, 2012~~ September 22, 2012)

**Where?**

/r/Smite Play-A-Pug Mumble (donated by tordana)

**Why?**

Why not? You enjoy this game? You want to see it do well? You want to see the competitive scene grow? That's going to take the effort of everyone. *Veterans:* We need players who have a firm grasp on the game - even if you just have one role or lane nailed down. *Non-Veterans:* Think you still have something to learn. Then sign up! We'll match you with veteran players to help you improve inside of the game.

**So what now?**

This is only going to succeed if everyone wants it to. We'll be matching two veteran players with three non-veterans. We'll then match you up against another team. Play as many games as you like, we'll even provide a mumble to chat in! Every week we'll be giving out prizes to everyone who takes part in one of the games. This week we'll be giving away several **PAX Artemis Skins**! In 4-6 weeks we'll be hosting the Demigod Challenge, a tournament for our Play-A-PUG players. We'd love to have players from the same team potentially against each other. We don't want one team that's played together for 500+ games to steamroll the tournament, so we'll mix and match the players just like our regular Play-A-PUG games. This will give everyone a fair shot a competitive play. Why take part in it if you're a veteran player? Wouldn't you like to have more competitive teams to play against? Don't you want to help build the community...? Then sign up and help us teach more players about the game, the meta, and high level play! You might just find some hidden talent somewhere in the mix...

**To sign up for our first Play-A-PUG event leave a comment below with your in-game name, skill level (veteran, mediocre, or noob), and preferred role / lane. We'll slot you into teams with similar interest, match you against a team, send you the game / password, and mumble information. All you have to do is show up!**

**! SPREAD THE WORD !**

Seriously, guys. I understand there are cases where surrender is needed -- leavers, trolls, etc. I'm not suggesting they take it out. I'm suggesting they devise some sort of incentive for players to stay.

http://pastebin.com/cvPC7r2h



Hello, my name is Sherb.
I've been streaming TF2 and other games for over a year now, and recently I started streaming Smite.
I may end up making this in to a video, for ease of use. Thoughts?

Recently I've noticed a large amount of Smite streamers showing up and/or people who want to stream smite who don't know how.
A lot of newer streamers, whom I've tried to watch, I just wasn't able to because it wasn't that great of a stream.
I don't claim to be an amazing streamer who everyone should aspire to be, but I at least want to help people out who aren't as sure, and pass on some of what I know.

First of all, the initial steps you want to take when you plan to start streaming.
There used to be a program called Xsplit, which in all fairness is STILL the best streaming softwarer, however it comes at a price.
Right now, the best option to take if you're not willing to pay a monthly fee, is a little program called Open Broadcast Software.

http://obsproject.com/

This tutorial will proceed assuming you're using OBS. Although a little headwork and clicking around will translate it to Xsplit easily.

Next we want to set it up.
Before you do anything, you need to configure your settings.

You need to keep in mind that streaming is VERY heavy on your Internet, the Upload speed especially.
Use http://www.speedtest.net/ to determine your upload speed. I'd personally recommend having 5mb/s or more, but it can be done from less, but won't look quite as good.
This becomes important soon, don't worry.

Next you want to click the settings tab at the top, and then click settings again.
You will be greeted by what appears a simple little menu... But then you want to click ""Encoding"".
This where your upload speed becomes important. It determines the bitrate (Basically overall quality) that you can stream at.

I have a 16mb/s upload and stream at 8000 bitrate, so use that as a rough template of what you can achieve. Obviously, the higher your bitrate the better.
Frankly, anything above 4000 doesn't really matter, I just like to show off.

Next click Broadcast settings. This is the part that will typically throw people off.

Mode: Live Stream

Streaming Service: Twitch/Justin.tv (Assuming you're using Twitch, why wouldn't you be?)

Server: Whatever is closest to you. For some reason I'm using US west which is stupid because I'm English... Let me fix that real quick....

Stream key: To get this, go to http://www.twitch.tv/broadcast and it will give you your stream key. This is THE MOST important step, also make sure that nobody else gets this.
The rest is personal preference.

Next, click video.
I stream in 720p, so I set my custom resolution to 1280x720. 
This is highly dependent on both your Internet and your computer speed.
The actual resolution you can stream at depends on your CPU speed (I use an AMD 8350 at 4.5ghz).
However, with Smite especially, your graphics card is extremely important in how well the game itself will perform during streaming.

Later, I'll suggest running a few tests for other things, when you do that you should test some resolution settings that will be comfortable for both you and your viewers.
TESTING YOUR STREAM IS VERY IMPORTANT. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS, IT CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LOT OF VIEWERS AND TOTALLY UNWATCHABLE STREAMS.

Next go to audio... This is all very self explanitory. Moving on.

Advanced: This tab isn't as important as the name suggests. Personally I've never changed anything and I leave it all default.


OKAY! So now we have OBS all set up and stream ready, now we just need to put our little bundle of joy together!

Start by right clicking in Scenes, and then clicking ""Add Scene"".
Now select your scene and click add and choose Game Capture.

Make sure Smite is running, now name your scene ""Game"" or ""Smite"" or something, and click OK.
On select application, find Smite and select it.
Now make sure you check ""Stretch image to screen"" and ""Ignore aspect ratio"". This allows for more flexibility, and as long as you're playing
in in the same format you're streaming (4:3 or 16:9) then it won't take away from the quality.
Then selecting Capture mouse cursor is purely optional. Keep in mind that when you're in game, and the mouse is hidden, then it also won't appear on stream (Unlike some annoying ass recording softwares).
Now click ""Ok"" and click ""Preview stream"". BOOM, there is your stream in your little window :3.

Now you can add customisation. You can add logos and such, and you can even make a neat little overlay to add to your stream.

You can find my overlay template here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1guzkx/stream_overlay_template/

Using a webcam is always a nice touch, since it adds a little to the personality of the stream and makes your viewers feel more connected.


-- From here onwards can also apply to people who already knew how to stream, but are new to it. --

Okay so now we have everything set up and you're ready to stream. Hitting ""Start Stream"" will make you go live and everyone in the world can watch! ... Assuming you set it up correctly.
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET. Now comes the part that really bothers me when I watch new streamers, because it's such an easy mistake to make and so many variables can affect it.
The microphone volume in comparison to the game volume. You will NOW want to start running tests.

Spending about half an hour on tests is very important, as it can make the difference between lots of regular viewers and a totally unwatchable stream.
You want to change your resolution until you find something comfortable, and also mess with volume of your mic and your game sounds. Being able to hear/talk to you is a very
big thing about streams, and will be the deciding factor in whether or not you succeed in streaming.

Okay so now you've finished running tests and you are TECHNICALLY ready to begin streaming.
But just a couple of little nitpicks now.

Make sure you have configured your Twitch page to have a catchy title, and the game listed as playing Smite. Otherwise you'll get no viewers at all.
Then make a nice banner/background. Of course that us purely optional, but first impressions count, and a nice banner will make people stick around.


So that's basically it. You are now ready to start streaming and meeting nice viewers! Have fun in streaming!


Disclaimer: Again I would like to make it PAINFULLY clear that I'm not pretending to be a successful/entertaining/amazing streamer who everyone should love. I am however trying to make a comprehensive guide for how to stream Smite.
Googling ""How to stream Smite"" brings up nothing for me, so it'd be nice to have it accessible to people I guess.

Thanks for reading, and feel free to drop your stream links in the comments below, I'll be sure to come by and watch some time!
Also ask any questions you have relating to troubleshooting etc, and I'll do my best to answer.

Ares is one of my favourites, but however, i feel he's completely lacking right now. You're thinking 'Damn it's Ares he's a pain in my ass' but when you play him, the tables turn and he's not comfortable at all and is totally situational. Here are a few advantages of playing him:

1) Excellent Aegis/Beads burner especially now you can blink ultimate with him - This allows your carries to focus down the enemy players with no actives left. 

2) Chains - You can absolutely melt any carry with no magical protection if you can combo 3 chains together, the cripple is also nice for bringing down God's with a lot of mobility and escape.

Consider these disadvantages:

1) He has absolutely NO pushing power. You can auto attack and searing flesh the wave but by the time it's dead the next full wave will be almost arriving. If you buy mystical mark it helps but that's a very expensive third item and useless if the enemy is magic heavy.

2) If you miss your first chain - what then? You're about as useful as a ham sandwich at a Barmitzvah. You have nothing to do beside bolster defenses and hope your carry does work.

3) He's very easily countered by CC such as Hades/Ymir who can interrupt his chain combo. Not to mention if the enemy team has an odin they can focus you down very easily.

4) In all of this, if Ares is behind then you're useless, it's hard to farm because you can't kill creeps or buffs and you'll die instantly with any engagement on enemy Gods.

So what can be done?

I'm not sure how HiRez feel about Ares but in my opinion he definitely needs something changing, what do you guys think? If you have any tips for me while playing Ares then let me know!",,False,,t5_2stl8,False,,poseidon,True,t3_1d9psv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1d9psv/discuss_ares/,

The site itself is nowhere near where I want it to be, but it is getting there. I was a little rushed in getting it out as it was going to be included in this patch in the in-game community sites section (which was my own fault). I'm continuing to develop features for the backend, but I need some frontend people. If you have any interest in writing, creating content, streaming, or whatever else goes on during the creative end of things; I'd really like to hear from you.

I'm also looking for a person to post day-to-day news and create content for the site. I'll continue to develop the backend, as well as, any features you can come up with or need (including graphics for say a video) and you'll handle the front end of things. I do have a form of compensation that I'd like to discuss with whoever decides they'd like to help out.

After I launch a few more features, get everything bug free, and do a quality/polish pass on the site. I'll be branching out to League of Legends and Dota 2 to form a little network of sites. I think this is a really great opportunity to get in on the groundfloor and help to get your content featured across a few websites.

Let me start off by explaining how I came to think of this. I was playing a game of conquest, my entire team, including me, was doing bad. The entire enemy team was extremely fed, and two of my team members quit. I was talking to the Ao Kuang on my team and I said ""They're pretty much acting like there are no lanes"" in response to their constant ganking.

This led me to thinking, what if there WERE no lanes... Imagine it, a conquest like map, filled with nothing but jungle. No lanes, no phoenixes, tower or Minotaur. You'd be running around the jungle, or perhaps waiting around a corner for your next enemy to wander by, when from behind Loki attacks. In an instant your dead, not knowing what hit you. The closest thing I can compare this to is The Hunger Games. I'm sure you've all read, or at least heard of it. Imagine a game style similar, with a game play similar to Arena. 400 tickets, 5 players, all out blood bath. There's not much objective other than to kill. Imagine that, but in the jungle, not being able to see the enemy, in suspense, moving around, peeking around corners, looking for your next kill. I think the mode would have tons of potential. I, though I don't know much about programming or coding, believe it would be fairly easy, using recycled jungle textures, and using the conquest map, just without lanes, phoenixes and towers removed. Obviously, some other non-visual changes would be needed. A few I already thought of were:

No wards, as I personally think vision of the jungle would lessen the suspense.
Higher passive gold and experience gain to make up for no creep farming.
More jungle camps and fury camps to allow for buffs and small amounts of gold and experience.

That's all I've come up with for now, but I'm sure Hi-Rez, and any community suggestions could fill in the blank spots and improve this possible game mode. I think this game mode has a lot of potential to be a fun mode, that the community would enjoy a lot. I ask Hi-Rez to please consider this. I personally get excited just thinking about the possibility of it. Please consider the mode, and I ask the community to discuss it, and if you do I ask you to show support to bring attention to it. Please vote with what you think here!

I'll agree that it is definitely egregious compared to other MOBAs, but I would like to put forth the argument that it is perfectly acceptable, and even a boon to Smite's mechanics.

Like many, I started playing smite after getting into MOBAs with LoL. One thing I really hated about LoL however was the tradeoff between damage and CC. Even though characters like malphite and Nautilus are really good, a lot of people tend not to pick these characters because the rest of those champ's kit is distinctly underwhelming to balance how much CC they have. This results in a lot of games where people pick what they want and if you just lose because you don't have CC. Nor could this problem be solved by adding a cc item because then supports would be forced to get that item and we would once again be at a standstill.

Smite fixes that by giving a ton of CC, BUT inherently giving everybody tons of ways to fight cc. There are a ton of ults and even a few non-ults in Smite that grant CC immunity. Between that and beads and aegis, I really don't see a problem. In fact this is one of my favorite things about smite. If you are good and you time ur summoners and ults well, you're not just immediately screwed by cc. This makes it fun to play carries who are generally targeted by cc despite how much cc they other team may have. It also makes it fun to not play carries cuz everyone has a ton of cc and can make a dent in teamfights.

TL;DR Yea smite has a lot of CC, but it also has a lot of ways to combat cc. This makes for a lot of chances for outplay which = more funtimes.

Before anyone asks, yes, I'm pretty salty about it. Why? Because no one wants to see any stomps at PAX; it's suppose to show off the game at its highest competitive potential right now and if this does go through, we're going to see a stomp. Everyone knows it. My team has only been scrimming seriously for one week and we've already proven to be a top contender and we can only get better. It gives teams no motivation to compete if HiRez is just naming off teams that haven't proven that they belong.

My intent for this post is to not bash on any teams and I mean no offense by anything that I've stated. But is this how the e-sports scene for SMITE is going to be?

Or an achievement for destroying X amount of enemy wards, which would give incentive for new players to learn and use Sentry Wards. Or body-blocking X number of Neith Ulti's aimed at a teammate. Or using Hel's CC cleanse to free teammates, etc. There are many other examples, I leave those to your imagination.

----


Today, beginning at 8PM EST, the College Starleague is proud to present our SMITE Charity Stream!  This event will begin a little bit after our Collegiate Dota Charity stream ends.  Since the main Collegiate Starleague channel is having their own event at this time, we'll be streaming over on the Collegiate Dota channel linked below!

**[Watch the charity stream here! We start at 8PM EST!](www.twitch.tv/collegiatedota)**

In order to raise money for child cancer research at the [Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center](http://www.uclahealth.org/homepage_med.cfm), we'll be featuring a wide variety of events in the hopes of raising cancer awareness and funds for the program. All proceeds go to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.

#**Donation Link:**

**[Click here!](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=BGEWDC73AA9VJ)**

***

##**Description**

6 Hi-Rez Streamers will be in a Skype call with the CSL event crew. The streamers will split into groups of 3 and invite 2 viewers per team to play with them. The two teams will then play a series of custom challenge matched against each other. ideally we will want to bring in new viewers after each game. Viewers who donate any amount of money will be placed into a pool/list which the CSL mods will be drawing from randomly to choose who gets invited to the next game.

Any viewer that donates with the expectation to be pulled into a match needs to supply his/her email address as well as their in game SMITE player name (not their Hi-Rez account name). Without the player name the streamers will not be able to bring them into the match (info should be submitted when viewer fills out donation form). If the viewers do not accept the invite after 2 consecutive tries or if they are not online, then they forfeit their chance and a new viewer will be picked. If possible the mods will try to get viewers who missed their chance into the next game.

***

##**Giveaways**

Throughout the stream, we will be periodically giving away codes for various Gods, which include their alternate colour skin.  At the end of the event, the two viewers that donated the most to the UCLA Reagan Center will be given an **Ultimate God Pack**.

Gods we'll be giving away:

**Fenrir, Isis, Athena, Hun Batz, Chang'e**

For the gods, it is their birthright and their call to greatness. However, such power is no easy feat for anything less. For others who were not born with the silver spoon in their hands, such a quest could take life and limb.*

&gt;*Rahu was a clever Asura, and envied the birthright of the Devas. Like many of his bretheren, he tried relentlessly to acquire the Deva's newest invention, Amrit: an alchoholic beverage that not only made the spirits pleasant, but also made the body all-powerful. It was the source of the Devas never-ending youth and great health. And it was something the Asuras lusted for.*

&gt;*Rahu, in a stroke of luck, managed to infiltrate the brewing of the immaculate drink, disguised as a Deva. When he saw his chance, he took it - but his luck was short lived, for the Sun and the Moon noticed him when others had not, and in their vigilance they alerted Vishnu, who used one of his avatars to quickly decapitate Rahu before he could swallow one drop.*

&gt;*But the drink of the Devas is powerful - drink still in mouth, Rahu's head stayed alive and flew into the heavens, while his body was reborn due to a boon and become its own entity - Ketu. Together, they spend their time circling the heavens, harassing the sun and moon and causing the terrifying eclipses of both.*

&gt;*Rahu and Ketu look down upon the land - they sense conflict is growing. For Rahu, it piques his endless interest in unending chaos. For Ketu, it serves his sole quest for immense knowledge. For both, a heavenly battle means there's only more greatness to be earned.*

**i don't have access to a scanner, so all i can provide are some bad quality camera shots. i'll get scanned images up on monday.**

right off the bat, we have an interesting god here. they function as a pair - once whole, now separate and individual. this means the kit revolves around how the two work as a team. build up some synergy and release the chaos on the enemy!
___


**Passive: Synergy**

Rahu and Ketu are two halves of what once was whole. Every skill they land on an enemy god brings them closer in synergy with their original form, reducing their mana costs. When they are in perfect synergy, their next skill is free to cast, but breaks their synergy.

---Perfect Synergy: 5

---Mana reduction per unit of Synergy: 10%

* 
* Their passive is all about spamming spells. why? so you can spam more spells. aesthetically, you could show synergy by making Rahu fly closer to Ketu's neck the more in synergy they are. when they are at max synergy, they are practically connected.

___

**Skill 1: Seething Volley**

Ketu volleys Rahu a distance away, where Rahu can gleefully let all the radiant heat he's captured from the sun deal damage to any enemy that gets close to him for a while before returning. During this time, Rahu is invulnerable.

---Volley Damage: 20/40/60/80/100 (+40%)

---AoE Damage: 10/20/30/40/50 (+20) every .5 seconds for 2 seconds.

---Duration: 2 seconds

---CD: 14

* 
* In this skill, Ketu chucks Rahu forward, where he will stop at a target location and begin to deal pulse aoe damage. during this time, he is invulnerable and he has a big, obvious aura to prove it - if you want to deal damage to the god unit, you MUST attack Ketu, NOT Rahu. he will not even take CC, although if you afflict Ketu with CC he will be afflicted with the status when he returns.

___

**Skill 2: Frigid Specter**

Rahu sends Ketu to float off and assault an enemy god, where the piercing cold he's assumed from the moon will damage and gradually slow nearby enemies until he can no longer follow his target. During this time, Ketu is invulnerable and moves faster for every enemy that is affected by his cold.

---Slow: +5% slow every .3 seconds.

---Damage Per Tick: 10/25/40/55/70 (+10%) every .5 seconds for 3 seconds.

---Duration: 2 seconds

---CD: 12

* 
* So in this skill, Rahu sends Ketu off to do the hard work. Ketu also gains an aura which lets people know that his is currently in skill mode and that Rahu must be the one targeted to deal damage to the god. You target any enemy god with this skill and Ketu will follow them for the entire duration, doing his best to get close. he never actually attacks, just drifts along and lets his cold aura do the work for him.

___

**Skill 3: Disorient**

Rahu and Ketu split up, moving faster and each taking half damage from all sources. When they reach their destinations, One forcefully rips the other to his location, dealing heavy impact damage to any enemy hit en route and mesmerizing them. 

---Movement speed: +25%

---Damage Reduction: 50%

---Impact Damage: 40/80/120/160/200 (+20%)

---Mezmerize Duration: .5/1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds

---CD: 18

* 
* This one is kind of tricky to explain, so let's do it step by step.

* Step 1: pick a target for your *GREEN* destination. one of them (chosen at random) flies to that location.

* Step 2: you have up to 2 seconds to pick a target for your *RED* destination. (the other one) flies to that location.

* When both make it to their destination, the one at the *GREEN* location will forcefully rip the other one over to his location through some telekinetic force, and anything in the flung one's path is hit like a bowling pin.

* So for example, Ketu goes to the *GREEN* location and Rahu goes to the *RED* location. when both make it, Ketu will rip Rahu, which means Rahu was the decoy and Ketu was the escape.

___

**Ultimate: Sun and Moon**

Rahu and Ketu join at the neck to become one entity and stand their ground, a rare occasion. Whole once more, Rahu and Ketu channel the powers of the sun and the moon at any target location near them while CC immune, causing any enemy to be caught in the beam to be severely hindered by burns and frost. If they are in Perfect Synergy, their effects are even greater.


---Burn Charges: 20/24/28/32/36 (+10%) every .2 seconds.

---Perfect Synergy (Burn): Interrupts spellcasting every .5 seconds, for 6 seconds.

---Frost Charges: 40% slow on affected enemy, 15% slow on enemies near affected enemy.

---Perfect Synergy (Frost): -15% protections, for 6 seconds.

---Charge Duration: 3 seconds

---CD: 90

* 
* it's a short pulse with a build up that is basically some damage and a laundry list of debuffs. you get hit by the pulse, and you're taking a mighty nice burn and a slow. not only that, but you slow your teammates if you get close to them. 

* but the real fun begins if Rahu and Ketu were in perfect synergy. if they were, prepare to have your skills randomly silenced every .5 seconds for 6 seconds. if you're channeling say, anubis's locusts? not anymore. have the bad luck of using a spin2win? annnnd you were interrupted. not only that, but you loose protections on top of it.


___

**Design Intent:** 

Rahu and Ketu need a special kind of treatment, and i wanted to give them that treatment. they rely on each other to accomplish what their whole did prior. they are shifty, they get in and out of areas with relative ease, and they rely on decoys to disorient the enemy and accomplish their goals.

basically, a lot like a magical loki.

but of course, when they come together to make a statement, they do it hard. they bring the powers of the sun and the moon to bear down on any enemy in an area they target, and they stand their ground and hold steadily while making that statement. not every time is a time to flee and be deceptive - sometimes you need to show your strength to achieve your goal.

It seems like people always say Wards are an incredible purchase and have a huge impact on the game.

With the addition of teleports and the 2-tiered ward system, wards got even better because they stay around longer and you can obviously teleport to them.

But why do I feel like people don't buy them?  

My last 10 games or so with Isis, I purchased probably 5-8 wards over the course of our 30 minute game.  Not all of the wards I placed were amazing, but they all mattered even if just to let us know that the enemy wasn't there.

So, Smite reddit -- Why don't you buy wards?

P.S. - This is not some whiny accusation post complaining about the people in my games.  I'm genuinely curious what reasons there are to NOT buy wards.

1370855978.0,22,self.Smite,1g1az5,Balancing Jungle - it's partly up to us as players,fabric9,37,15,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1g1az5/balancing_jungle_its_partly_up_to_us_as_players/,"First of all, can we agree that having a jungler in the game is a binary choice? Either the metagame requires it by supporting it, or it doesn't. In one case, you'll see the team with a jungler win 9 times out of 10 (which is the case after the Bumba's patch), in the other the team without a jungler wins 9 times out of 10 (which was the case prior to the Bumba's patch).

Balancing it so that jungling becomes an option is almost *impossible*, because you need to balance it for having a jungler facing another jungler. Giving your jungler access to *both* jungles would mean your jungler automatically snowballs out of control and carries the game.

This is because the limit to how much exp/gold the jungle gives is based upon how fast the jungle camps respawn - not how fast you can clear it. If Hirez were to change the jungle so that there were more exp/gold camps, and they respawned every minute (but obviously rebalancing the exp/gold rewards to keep them in check), it would be possible. But that's a huge change.

Not only that, but if the enemy team doesn't have a jungler, you're not forced to buy wards, thus removing the strain of maintaining 4-5 wards on your team (300 gold every 3 minutes - or a free kill every 3 minutes).

**TL;DR**: In order for the jungle to be an *option*, not a *requirement* or *non-viable*, major changes would have to be made to the jungle camps and architecture. I don't see this happening. We'll have to settle for it being a requirement or non-viable.

---

Second, I would like to talk about the solo lane. We're seeing a lot of 1v2's right now, and that's partly because people aren't used to the jungle role, and partly because of a lack of support for a designated solo lane. As pointed out elsewhere, people just assume that ""left is solo"" because that's where the jungler starts. That makes little sense though, as the jungler no longer is required to lane at all. He can sustain entirely off the jungle, and so, as suggested previously by someone else, the duo lane should be placed on the part of the map where you need most early game presence. The gold fury side.

And junglers need to key in on that fact. They need to be able to realize that *hey, my duo lane and myself have made their first buy, they've just pushed their opponents out of lane* (or scored a kill) - *we can do gold fury*. This is something that will take time as well, but once people start picking up on it, it'll be common practice. The only question that really remains is whether gold fury isn't too hard to do that early. For example, one person should not be able to poke at 4 people doing gold fury and manage to prevent it, or the whole idea falls on it's face.

**TL;DR**: Hirez may need to look at rebalancing gold fury in the early game to enable a solo lane to exist, rather than making it two 1v2 lanes. Junglers and duo laners need to take objectives when they push enemies or score kills.

---

Third, I would like to talk about wards. With 4 wards you can cut the map in half, giving you vision of gold fury, fire giant, and two buff camps (white/blue). This will limit your opponents jungler from invading and heavily prevent ganking (a 5th ward at the enemy red would be nice if they have a jumping jungler). The problem is that wards automatically give vision of other wards, which means each time you ward you may trigger a ward-war. This is troublesome, for many of the spots that Blue team would like to ward, Red team would also like to ward.

The best solution to this problem would be to change the ward system by introducing a second type of ward that grants vision of other wards, pricing it higher, and making the regular wards only grant vision of the area, not of other wards. This will allow for more ward-placements without triggering ward-wars.

With time, people will learn the proper ward placements and who should buy them. I think the best solution would be for the support player in the duo lane to maintain two wards, placing one at the enemy buff camp and one at the GF. The midlaner should maintain the ward at FG, and possibly at the enemy red in the case of a jumping jungler on the enemy team. The last ward is the responsibility of the solo laner, which should be placed at the enemy blue/white.

**TL;DR**: Hirez needs to look at revamping the ward system, and players need to start using wards more actively and learn their responsibility in warding.

---

In summary, there are a few things Hirez needs to do to make jungle better, the least of which is adjusting Bumba's so that it doesn't snowball the jungler out of control. There are a ton of things we as players need to learn and adapt to make this transition, the biggest of which is to start working as a *team of 5 players* instead of being stuck in the mindset of ""this is my lane, I will win it"". I think, given time, these changes could make Smite a much, much more interesting game, not only competitively, but also casually.",SUGGESTION,False,,t5_2stl8,1370856511.0,suggestion,athena,True,t3_1g1az5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1g1az5/balancing_jungle_its_partly_up_to_us_as_players/,

There needs to be a mumble, teamspeak, or ventrilo server that players who want to play with other skilled players who know what they're doing can get on and make PUG matches.  This is a pretty prevalent thing in a lot of shooters (CS, TF2) and I don't understand why nobody has mentioned it earlier.  But also, if the top players want other teams to join the scene and bridge the skill gap between them, then some of the top players need to be in the PUGs as coaches if they can.  Pick Up Games in smite could be awesome if run correctly with two team captains who pick a squad (however there needs to be a system in place to stop the top team players from just picking each other).

TL;DR: Basically if people want the comp scene to grow, there needs to be a place where people can learn to communicate with each other like they would in a match and they also need to be able to practice against the best.

Also, I realize that this is all good and well and the best thing to do would be for myself to take charge and rent a mumble server, but I can't just spend money on something like that willy nilly, so I thought I'd start the spitball here and see if anyone else has anything to add.",SUGGESTION,False,,t5_2stl8,False,suggestion,anhur,True,t3_1fk2ay,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1fk2ay/smite_pug_mumble/,

I just want to start off by saying I am by no means pro, but have been playing the game a lot for the last 2 months and feel I have a really good understanding of the game.  I play primarily melee characters focusing on Assassin or Bruiser, but these tips can transfer to any character and any play style.  I have played all roles and am confident playing any roll in any matchup so far.

**Wall of Text Warning**

First thing I want to talk about is playing other characters.  Now I know what you are thinking ""I am not good with XYZ characters, I am only good with ABC"".  This may be true, but if you really want to be good with ABC, you need to know first hand how XYZ play and what combo's you could see from them.  As you play other characters, you will start to realize things about them you may not see on a regular basis... and who knows you may like them!  As an example, anyone like Posiedon could toss a wirlpool right on top of you if you are the red jungle camp beside middle lane and start ganking you 2-3 seconds before you even know where they are.   I have even seen people steal red jungle buff camp from me from middle lane by tossing spells over.  Not to say this is the main reason for playing other characters, but knowing your enemy will let you know how to beat them.  I strongly recommend everyone try and become well versed in all classes and damage dealers ranging from Magic to Phystical, Assassin to Tank, and everything in between.  The more your know about your opponent, the easier it is to kill them.

On the subject of knowing other characters, play other game modes!  Things like Assault will force you out of your comfort zone and in to a character you may not know well.  It will give you a chance to play a character you may not know well, and at the same time maybe get a win of the day and some favor you don't normally get.  Arena is a fantastic mode to get your ready for late game conquest when team battles are happening.  You may be the best Smite Conquest player early and mid game, but if you are constantly losing late game, is it because your team battles are losing?  Arena is a fantastic way to get a ton of experience for late game conquest and I STRONGELY recommend everyone play it, at least for the win of the day favor.

Next up, Items and Skills.  When I first started the game, one of the things I loved was the auto build/auto buy options.  These options are, hands down, the worst things you can use.  Now if you just started the game and have 2 games under your belt, by all means use them.  They are generally not horrendous, but 99% of the time you will benefit more from choosing your own skills and own items.  ""But Hogie, I have a custom made auto buy I use and not the default"", well you are one step up from starting, but we can do better!  Choosing your own items can single handedly change the battle of a fight!  Reason behind this is if you are facing 4 magic uses, and your auto build if getting you some physical defense, is that really helping you at all?  Learning all of the items in the game will help push you in to the next level of your game play and let you take the next step in to becoming a god killing machine.  By knowing all the items (Tied in with knowing the god you are against from above and the items that god is using), you can cater your items to hard counter their items.  Activate items are a whole different story and each god can use each item to their full advantage.  I don't want to go in to detail on active items as it really changes by the hero, but never overlook items like Aegis.  When you're sitting there killing creeps in your lane and out of nowhere you hear ""RELEASE THE KRAKEN!"", pop Aegis and laugh as you turn around and murder that sneaky ganking Posiedon.

On the note of items, always carry a couple healing pots on you and never overlook the other potions.  Magic and Physical attack potions are really great to give you the slight advantage in a fight you may have been losing before.  Auto-Skills are not as bad to have turned on, but the first 4-5 skills may differ depending on who your are laning against/with and using the F1 F2 F3 F4 buttons to level your skills takes 0.2 seconds and may help you a ton... get use to it as it will help as well.

Play defensive!  Before level 5, there is 0 reason to engage an enemy hero unless they attack you.  There is of course always exceptions for this, but don't run past a pack of minions to a full life hero and engage them.  Poke at them from a range if you can and watch to put on some pressure.  Early game the minions will literally destroy you.  If you engage a hero near their minions, most can run in circles while their archers kill you in 5 seconds.  Don't do this!  Another thing not to do at low levels is chase an enemy hero.  Everyone wants that early game kill that will let them get the advantage, but forcing your enemy hero back to base and 30-40 seconds of lost exp is a HUGE advantage early game.  This could mean 1-2 levels you are gaining that they are not, but if you chased and got killed by the tower the tables have changes.  **Do not** put yourself in the position to die early game to something stupid like minions or towers because you only have yourself to blame if you do.  Early game is *the most important time* of the game and will make or break the potential of your hero.  Stay back, play it defensively and get the exp from minions.  I like to put my first point in to something that will help me push my lane rather than kill.  When I play Loki, my first point is in Decoy to push my lane, but I do not put a second point in to it unless late game when its the only skill I can put a point in to.

*Jungling* in smite is not ideal, but don't overlook it.  As I personally play a lot of assassins I find myself in the jungle a lot and unless I am chasing another god, I normally stop to kill them.  The buffs can be a huge advantage in any fight team or otherwise and should never be overlooked.  Also the exp gained from jungle mobs can be huge mid game when your hero can start steam rolling the jungle mobs, but never burn *all* of your skills on these camps in case a enemy hero is lurking.  If an enemy hero is stalking you in the jungle, they generally try and steal your buff and then go for the kill or run.  If i see this happening I like to immediately focus the hero and hope they are still going for the buff.  In any jungle camp situation where you are attacking the mobs and an enemy hero is coming in, you are out of position so never forget this!   Positioning and getting the jump on people in Smite is 90% of the battle and throwing your opponent off will get you a lot of kills.  Scare someone who is jungling in to using a skill early, and you get the kill.  Get scared because an enemy hero got the jump on you, and be killed.

**Know your surroundings!**. (Added thanks to a_jlt_sandwich's suggestion)
At first glance looking at the game, it is a very basic map and easy to learn.  It is easy to get use to the map and understand where you need to be or where you need to go if certain things happen, but there are a lot of things in this game that will help you not be ganked or to do the ganking.  Sound is a **very** important part of this game and I strongly recommend using headphones with no music on if you want to get the most out of your game.  Every hero, every skill, and every part of the map has it own sounds and getting to know them will help you greatly!  Going back to the learning other characters section, get to know what their abilities sound like too!  Some ability sounds will indicate you have 1 or 2 seconds to react, but what happens if you hear an ability that you don't have time to dodge?  Something like Aegis could be used her to nullify an ultimate you know you cannot avoid ;).  Ra's Beam for example has a very easy to hear sound not only when it is moving, but when he starts it as well (Same with Ra's Ultimate).  If you are mid lane vs Ra and you are running and hear his beam, understanding this sound will let you side step left or right in time for it to not hit you; and this could mean living or dying.  Aside from ability sounds, what else is there?  Jungle camps make a lot of sound when a hero is killing them and even if you cannot hear the hero, you can hear the jungle mobs from any lane.  If you and your lane partner are together left, and you can hear someone killing a Cyclopes... welp time to gank blue buff because an enemy hero is trying to steal your jungle mobs!  Did you also know you can hear the Gold Fury die from right lane (Maybe even mid) when all the coins start raining?   One great tool the game has already given you for helping with most of this is **wards**.  Wards can be purchased at the shop for 75 and can be placed anywhere on the map to give you vision.  It is a invisible item to the other team, and just sits on the ground to let you and your team have vision of that part of the map.  If another team places a warn near yours though, they can kill your warn.  Common places to put wards are in the jungle for places to look for ganks.  A lot of people like to put them at the Gold Fury and Fire Giant as well.  If you have a ward at right side Gold Fury and the full enemy team is there killing, your team may not be able to scramble in time to get there, but this will give you knowledge that you can push left lane tower very hard and even take some damage if you need to.

The last thing I want to touch on, and maybe even the most important thing, is the build in voice commands.  Getting to know these commands WILL improve your game play and team play in general.  Get to know the basis ones that people use, and use them on the regular.  I am still learning a lot of these, but they will make you and your team work together!  Keep in mind most of these commands also have general's with them that are also of use.  VAA would give you just ""Attack!"" and can be a good one to initiate a team fight, where VA1 would only give you Attack Left Lane.

* VA(X) - Attack X Lane!
* VF(X) - Enemy Missing X Lane (VFF - Enemy Missing)
* VT(X) - Enemy Has returned to X Lane - If you call a missing Enemy, make sure you tell your team they have returned please!
* VD(X) - Defend X Lane!
* VC(X) - Careful X Lane!.  Also VCC is just ""Careful!"", combined with VGG ""Gank!"" can be very helpful for everyone in all lanes to look out.
* VS(X)(X) - Self commands.  Examples would be VSA(S) ""I'll attack X Lane""
* VVV(X) - More self commands geared towards giving your team information.  Example VVVR Ultimate if Ready and VVVD Ultimate is Down.  Great info for team battles and will let your tank know not to engage yet if your Ultimate is down.
* VVVG - ""Group Up!""  Great for late game if the other team is pushing as a group.  VVVG + VD(X) is a great combo to tell your team ""Group Up"" and then ""Defence X Lane"".
** VVVT - ""It's a trap!""

There are a ton of voice commands I am missing, and as I said I am still learning them, but use them and start learning them if you haven't already. 

There is stuff I am sure I'm missing, but I am starting to babble :)  I hope anyone reading has learned something, or at least enjoyed the read.  Please comment with suggestions or if I missed anything you think I should add.

1367311651.0,27,self.Smite,1defiv,Things that would make the Smite competitive scene more entertaining to me [add your own],LolaRuns,30,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1defiv/things_that_would_make_the_smite_competitive/,"Disclaimer: Please note that a lot of these are subjective and a ton of these will be fairly pointless to most people (like most people don't mind just asking for these things in twitch chat, it's just what I would envision for my convenience/laziness) 


1.) Celebrity Joust Tournament for Charity
You know how the pro-scene has been all drama lately? How about some positive counter PR. Get a handful (as many as possible, but I'm realistic here) of the big team pro players (normals can apply as well). Each picks a charity (real charities, no ""Society for the Treatment of Victims of Allied's Mad Wall Skillz"" :p).  They fight a Joust tournament. The prize money gets donated to the charity of the winner's choice. Between the games players call in to the casters and plug their charity (what the charity is, why they chose it, encourage fans to donate). Fans can brag about how much their fave suppports charity and does good in the world. Players are proud about how much money their charity made, regardless of whether they won. Warm fuzzies all around.  


2.) Dear Pro teams, any of them, please do a Reverse Draft show match/scrim just for fun ( http://youtu.be/2NsU7-fAgiA?t=47s ). Reverse draft is basically that you pick your enemy's gods and vice versa (meaning you can force them to play setups they hate for the lulz, excluding a few ground rules, which we could just make up for Smite, must draft at least one tank, must draft at least one ranged carry, must draft at least one physical and one magic god, bans still exist). Plea, plea, plea :( 


3.) More scrims being streamed where you can see both sides or the teams are in voice chat with each other for some good natured banter. Oh and more transparency when those are on. Could be as simple as the teams announcing it on twitter and there's a separate twitter dedicated to retweeting those type of announcements. 


4.) A decent tournament calendar of all the tournaments. 
An unrealistic dream maybe to have all the tournaments on one site rather than having to go to each organizer's site to find out anything, but still. A tourney calendar collecting all the upcoming tournaments. Both to watch and to take part in. As a gamer curious to check out the pro-scene and match my skills I should have it easy to find which tourneys are when for my skill level and my game mode of choice. Or when the next tournament is where I can get the exclusive Kali skin :p 

Things of interest: 

Tournament Name

Date

Game Mode

Skill Level

Where it is Streamed

Who casts

Who Oranganizes

Prizes

Sign In Time

Sign In Contact Details

Special rules if any

Organizer payment track record [fast, ok, unknown] 


(Think http://esportcalendar.com/ but prettier )
  

5.) A decent wiki for the teams with their current rosters
After all the recent changes and switcheroos, who plays for Curse? Who is in Denial? Who are Shing's new compadres? Are Victorious Secret a new team or a renamed version of an old team? Damned if I know/have a place where to look it up.  Maybe teams that have openings could even have that and their contact details posted there as well.
 

6.) More Vods particularly of interesting games (first usage of Apollo and Nezha in tourneys, jungling Arachne in a tourney WTF? ) Alternatively, more tournament write ups that feature replay numbers and timers in the twitch (direct links to the times would be better). 


7.) Rogue casters parallel to the tournament that cast the games not featured on the main channel :p


8.) Mini player interviews in the tourney streams, particularly in the empty time between matches. More guest commentators. Let's say a prominent team isn't doing the tournament because too many of their roster are on vacation. Invite the captain to maybe co-commentate on a game or two. Or maybe let a casting hopeful co-cast one or two games of the early games just for some variety (Smitten? OctanePro?). 


9.) Speaking of casters, there are so many casting hopefuls that are always asking for concrete feedback. =&gt; how about a tournament for casters. Let's say there's one of the casual tournaments and any caster can sign up and they cast the games round robin style with different co casters combinations. At the end the twitch can vote who they liked best. =&gt; instant feedback/experience gained/jump into cold water achieved. 


10.) Awesome tournament graphics by Inuki. Better tourney promotion in general. ""It starts now announcement"" and ""this is the wrap up"" on reddit, twitter, on time. 


11.) Friendly ""student exchange"" with other games. Groups of Smite players challenge games of players from Game X. Players of Game X must play Smite, Smite players in turn must try their game. Amusing failing is streamed for everybody's amusement. Ideally with the players from the opposite game commenting and mocking lovingly.
