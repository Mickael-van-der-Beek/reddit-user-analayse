My girlfriend and I just moved into DC and could only afford a studio apartment (~$1600/month for ~500 sq. ft.). We were initially worried about space, but now we feel that we have plenty. Everything in the after photos totaled less than $1000 (excluding the books on the shelves and items in the storage room).

Anything you would change? Did I make any giant mistakes (considering Im a guy who has never done anything like this before)?

**EDIT:** To address common questions below, here is some more information.

* The paint I used was called Grey Mountain by Ben Moore (color #1462)
* Photography done by me. You can [check it out here](http://www.flickriver.com/photos/dwmark/)
* The deer head was bought on ebay ([Here is a link to the exact same one](http://www.ebay.com/itm/THE-DUKE-Deer-Head-statue-figure-H22-5-x-L15-75-x-W13-75-/140884772977?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item20cd630871)). And then I spray painted it with [this](http://www.amazon.com/Rust-Oleum-249126-Painters-Multi-Purpose-12-Ounce/dp/B002BWOS7G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353330138&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=white+spray+paint).
* Map (and many other varieties) can be purchased for a lower price than Amazon [here](http://www.wall-maps.com/World/NGworld-exec-over-f.htm). *I would caution against the laminated maps by Nat Geo b/c the glare is tremendous!

I was hoping that people might be able to give me some ideas on decorating and/or renovating.

So far, I have purchased this [sofa](http://youngerfurniture.com/products/sectionals-modular/James-Sectional) (but with a light gray cover, with some blues mixed in) and this [cowhide rug](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Hides-Cowhide-Brazilian/dp/B005MDUARS/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360764921&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=cowhide+rug) to place in front of the fireplace.  I've also purchased a reclaimed farm table and bench for our dining area (which I don't have pictures of), but we will be putting that table/bench on top of this [rug](http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Teal-Grey-Area-Rug-710-x-1010/6650179/product.html).

As for renovations, we will be painting what is now that bright blue wall, but haven't decided on the color yet.  Also, we are hoping to stain the cabinets and put up a backsplash in the kitchen.

We also want to get ride of that odd/bulky sheetrock above the fireplace and replace it with a nicer mantle and possibly some stones.  We were thinking of something like this.

Any thoughts/recommendations/suggestions are very welcome!

EDIT:  None of the furniture in there is mine.  They are the previous owners' (although my table/bench look much like theirs).

I decided to get a carpenter in to look at putting frosted glass in instead.

Worth. Every. Penny.

The door before: http://imgur.com/dCrIfjs
The hallway before: http://imgur.com/rHNSJSx
The door after: http://imgur.com/XZB4NJU
The hallway after: http://imgur.com/FmJcWRl

It finally feels welcoming, and ready to be decorated. Took the carpenter 2hrs just to cut the holes. The door was more solid than we expected!

Edit: wow! didn't expect such a response. Here are some more photos of the patio area (old front door) and the current view. It's still under construction, but will be landscaped once the rest of the conversions are completed.

(If you can't tell right off the bat, I'm Swedish and like your typical Swede I'm in love with the clean white look that's such a cliché whenever someone mentions Scandinavian interior design!)

It was my first apartment, but my husband(then boyfriend) and me ended up living there for 5-6 years. These photos were taken just when I was starting to feel like we were getting somewhere with the place, maybe our first or second summer. The furniture layout is very basic and un-imaginative, I'll post some more recent pictures from when I got more creative with the layout at a later date.


http://i.imgur.com/KQ3Qs.jpg
The living room was rather small, the first picture is taken almost at the back wall, where we had two small desks with our computers (no pics of that, as it was just a mess of techonology and eletrical cords.)

I don't like clutter, but both my husband and me are pretty big on books, and althougth the ""library""style can look awesome, we weren't able to pull it off. Instead we opted for a clean, relaxing look.

 All the cupboards you see are actually bookshelves filled with books in double rows, with shutters on them to keep them out of sight.  




http://i.imgur.com/fGhH2.jpg
Here you see what is opposite the bookshelves - a sofa, a rocking chair and an armchair just out of site, everything is from IKEA, except for the little wooden table which is an heirloom made my my great grandfather.
Also, bonus kitties!


Do you guys have any pics from your past homes you'd like to share for the curious?

It was pretty [dull, and yes, had a pink backsplash.](http://i.imgur.com/ftqSl.jpg)

Well [here is looking into the living room now](http://i.imgur.com/lIpv2o1.jpg). And [from the living room to the kitchen/dining room.](http://i.imgur.com/zZ60jrs.jpg) I put in a [pressed tin backsplash](http://i.imgur.com/mQiOlJU.jpg) to replace the pink tile.

For the [dining room i got antique folding chairs that i spray painted fun colors](http://i.imgur.com/n4Wz0X5.jpg) I got a nice [white leather chair, that has the same studded look of the couch.](http://i.imgur.com/lrGzmoz.jpg) And [here's a better look at the couch, it can actually be seperated and reconfigured. And the ottoman is the same size as each seat, so it can turn into a lounge chair.](http://i.imgur.com/WQO1LfX.jpg)

[The accent wall in the kitchen](http://i.imgur.com/NY9mMh5.jpg) I need to touch up the paint there, i moved the fire alarm to a better location. (the ceiling)

And this is my bedroom, that's since it is a very good size, [i turned it into a makeshift den as well.](http://i.imgur.com/SXddoKm.jpg) I call it my reading couch. [And finally, we have my bed](http://i.imgur.com/69xcXnp.jpg)

So yeah, i'm pretty happy with it. I spent a total of.. About $2,000-$2,500 on everything. (that includes paint, furniture, new hardware/lighting etc) The dining room chairs were $2 a piece, and $12 worth of spray paint. My TV cabinet is an [old record player](http://i.imgur.com/7NnXfs6.jpg) i bought for $15 then painted. (it's broken) The backsplash cost a grand total of $4. (50 cents for the tin, that i bought at a yard sale. And $3.50 for silver paint) Most expensive thing in my house is the couch. That was $500. But it was on sale from $2,200. So it was a fantastic deal. I never paid full price for anything. Everything is yard sales, clearance items and refurbished.

So let me know what you think! Any suggestions are more then welcome!

Help me brighten her day by refreshing the bedroom.,DrizztD0urden,51,11,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/1cmxjs/wife_is_sick_and_away_for_1_week_help_me_brighten/,"My wife has been under the weather for the past month now, and is away for a week, teaching.  I would like to surprise her by polishing up the master bedroom before she returns.


The former owners of the house had left a half can of red paint (labeled crushed velvet) which was used to paint the accent wall.  I patched the wall up and put a new coat of red on it to clean up the look.  I also have a can of bright white paint for the doors and baseboards (have been doing the main floor trim with this color), and will apply that soon. Sadly we don't have the funds/time to replace that old berber rug.


My wife likes to sew, so I would like to get some fabric for:
* Throw pillows
* Curtains
* Re-covering her grandmothers old rocking chair


and hopefully incorporate or compliment the paint colors with these.


The rest of the walls are pretty beat up, so I wouldn't mind painting these too, but what color would match this red and the black/white of the furniture?  I'm thinking a lighter grey perhaps.


All the furniture is your typical black ikea stuff, which hopefully should be easy to match.


If you have any pointers, or suggestions, I'm all ears!

Thanks in advance.

* **UPDATE** *
I'm a bit of a Photoshop amateur.  I applied a grey color (to an old pre-touched up picture of the room), to the other walls, and it just doesn't look quite right to me.  I think it looks bad with the carpet maybe.  [grey](http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d150/DrizztD0Urden/BedroomMastergrey.jpg)

Attempt #2 with a darker grey color using the panoramic picture.  I think it looks better, but might be too.. masculine?  [dark grey](http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d150/DrizztD0Urden/BedroomMasterPanogrey.jpg)

[I posted here about 5 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/ufpau/help_with_living_room_colour_scheme_and_anything/) asking for suggestions for my living room.

After taking advice from you and other sources, we have finished updating the room.

Major changes include reducing the size of the lobby, moving the door and hanging the TV on the wall.

We also have new wooden flooring, rugs, furniture and pictures.  What do you think?

1332673146.0,40,self.InteriorDesign,rcki1,InteriorDesign - Basic Guide to Colors,easternoracle,53,13,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/rcki1/interiordesign_basic_guide_to_colors/,"I'm by no means an expert, but this is meant to provide a basic overview of how to choose different colors for rooms you are trying to decorate. Please use this as a guide to help choose colors and patterns that suit your personal style. Also, please add to this with any tips, patterns or pictures you've found helpful. 


**Basics on color theory**

[First and foremost familiarize yourself with the color wheel and how to use this](http://www.colormatters.com/color-and-design/basic-color-theory). Learn about harmonizing and complementary colors as this will be important in some palettes you may want to choose. 

**Choosing a color for a room**

Now that you have the basics down on color theory, you're going to have to pick a palette for your room. [This article has a good overview on where to start for with this](http://www.rentaldecorating.com/color_home_decorating.htm). MaleFashionAdvice also has a good guide to color. [Remember that this is used for clothing, but still some of the theories still apply](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ginj6/in_which_epicviking_teaches_you_how_to_match/).

What you really want to decide is what you'll be decorating around. Choose a focal point. Is there a sweet new piece of furniture that you have? Do you have a new painting or photo you want to stand out? Do you want things to blend together?


**Contrasting colors**

If you have a piece of furniture you want to stand out, choose contrasting colors to make this piece catch the eye when you walk into the room. For example, if you have a red couch, you may want to choose greens for the wall. This will cause a high contrast. If you want to make the contrast less extreme, use secondary and tertiary colors. Examples of this can be found [here](http://st.houzz.com/simages/81506_0_4-7238-traditional-living-room.jpg) and [here](http://media.onsugar.com/files/ed2/192/1922794/46_2009/c42728ff53a6933c_Patterned-living-room.xlarge.jpg) and [here](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-0Tg5RaCr5M/SqPWM15oeYI/AAAAAAAAAkc/IAKzIdiuoQU/s400/Contrast%2520Bedroom.jpg) 

**Harmonizing Colors**

Another approach is to make everything harmonize in the room. Again you'll want to create contrast by choosing deeper and ligher shades of the color you are using. For example, choose a lighter shade of color for your walls than the furniture or the borders to windows and your doors. Some pictures of rooms that use harmonizing colors can be found [here](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2546/3837836007_48866dc488.jpg) and [here](http://www.suiyotei.com/english/room/img/img_03.jpg) and [here.](http://st.houzz.com/fimgs/30d1fe2a0c0e8d76_1000-w252-h252-b0-p0--eclectic-bedroom.jpg)

**Darker colors vs lighter colors**

Again you're going to have to think about the feel you want for the room. [Darker colors (deep shades of reds, browns, blacks) tend to give more of a traditional and formal feel](http://www.interior-design-it-yourself.com/images/vintage_interior_design_wood_room.jpg). 

[Lighter colors (light blue, white, pinks) feel more awake and give a calmer feel](http://interiorgallerydesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Wonderful-Light-Color-Interior1.jpg).

**Resources**

Here are some good sites that have prearranged color schemes already. [I got these from a post in MFA as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/r1ib5/i_thought_mfa_could_use_a_little_tool_for_getting/)

The idea of having to get them refinished from time to time also bothered me. Thank goodness for the new trend of ""wood"" tiles. They have gotten so much better since they first came out and there are so many different kinds and styles. Best of all, we put heat underneath them. Warm, cozy, unique distressed wood look, durable &amp;amp; strong, never needs to be refinished. I figured I would post this since I had no idea how it would come out and when I looked around on the internet I had a hard time finding someone who did it. I really like how they came out.

Custom Oak features – hardwood floors, ceiling beam, kitchen/bathroom cabinets, staircase railing – as well as a vaulted ceiling in the living room. Not a big fan of the style of railing, cabinets, ect, expect I love the Oak wood. The white paint on the Oak is tacky IMO (See the kitchen cabinets and stair railing for reference). I need some ideas on what color wall paint goes well with the oak wood stain color. Do you recommend a different stain on the wood?
Currently the living room is painted 3 different colors and the master has pink carpet and floral pink wallpaper in the Master bath. The double mirror vanity in the Master bath is very outdated as well. 
I want the home to be true to its mid-century ranch style roots, but updated to be clean and contemporary. I like rustic and Scandinavian styles, but I’m truly open to all ideas and suggestions.
I’m starting with almost no furniture, so (budget-minded) suggestions would be great too! Thank you.

I recently discovered this subreddit, and I thought it might be a neat idea to make a resource list for rentals- things that can be done to 'customize' a rental place... without forfeiting your deposit! My husband and I are in the process of moving, but we'll post a hometour when we get settled into our new place.

Now, I consider patching nail holes and touching up paint/repainting in the realm of reversible... I know some people don't. I also tend to sink some time into creating a fantastic place for myself and my husband to live, even though we live in rentals. I know some people may find this level of customization ridiculous, but I enjoy doing it, and getting to redo it every time we move. :) 

 I'd love to keep this as a constantly updated list, so feel free to comment!

Flooring:


-Rugs. Lots and lots of rugs. New York apartments always had gorgeous hardwoods-- so I have a hard time adjusting to the terrifying brown carpets in Atlanta. 

-Flor Tiles are a great way to cover up flooring. And with custom sizing, easy to do! 

-Some folks go as crazy as to cover their linoleum with more linoleum… I am not that crazy. The premise is that you lay out a grid of tape, sticky side up, and press the tiles into it. 


Walls:


-Painting- there's nothing that makes as big of a change as painting a wall. If you're scared to paint an entire room, try painting just an accent wall!

-Adding moulding. I love chair rails, and commonly add them to apartments. Easy and inexpensive! For cheater wainscoting, paint below the chair rail the same color as the chair rail, and above a different color. 

-Removable Wall Paper. 

-Wall paper panels

-Fabric hangings (similar to curtains- I sew a dowel pocket into the top of a piece of fabric. You suspend the dowel parallel to the floor, and can get a decent amount of wall coverage.) 

-Wall decals- Blik also makes a neat product similar to removable wallpaper. 

-Art! 

Curtains:


-Most of the rental shades are easily removable. I pull them down from the windows, tuck them in a plastic bag (labeled with window location) and store them under the bed. I replace them with a curtain rod and drapery. 

-If they're not removable, most of the time you can remove the stick the tilt wand. Cover the top with a valence, or use a roman shade (depending on the design of the window/shade). My go to is a handmade roman shade with a curtain rod/drapery over the shade, although I also love the look of a valence.


Bathrooms:


-New shower head. 'Nuff said!

-Also sometimes a new toilet seat, depending on the age of the bathroom. Lap of luxury here!

-I like to move the height of my shower bar up to the ceiling, and replace the standard rail with a stainless steel one. I also like to use metal shower rings instead of the plastic ones a lot of homes come with.

-For bathroom storage, I like to cut a back-of-the-door shoe storage unit in half, add loops of ribbon to the top and hang from Command hooks inside the bathroom vanity doors.

-Very frequently I'll switch out the mirror that comes with the rental for a framed one, or wall-mount a mirrored cabinet.

-I love to add the [Ikea Frack](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/38006200/) to bathrooms as well. Makes applying mascara easier!

-If the bathroom vanity is painted, I'll normally repaint it white and change the hardware. (this may include the knobs on the drawers/cabinets, the faucet etc.

-Towel bars. I'm not sure if it's just my luck with apartments, but I never seem to have good towel bars. That's one of my first 'renovations' to most new places. 

-Add freestanding furnishings, if space permits. (i.e., a small bench or table.) 

-Based on your theme, buy matching accessories (i.e., towels, shower curtains, bathmat).

-I'm a big fan of storage cubes in the bathroom. I've also seen some folks use Ikea spice racks on the wall next to the vanity as a way for extra storage, or the Asker rail system. Our current bathroom has very little storage, so my husband and I each have a basket with our day to day essentials that we take out in the morning/evening and put away in our closet when not in use. Easy peasy! 

-If you have a pedestal sink and need the extra storage, consider a sink skirt! 

-Also, art. Doesn't have to be amazing, but makes the room appear less sparse. 

Kitchens:

-Add art! 

-Consider changing out the hardware.

-Consider painting the back splash. 

-Consider changing the sink faucet (depending on how gross it is!) 

-Consider changing the light fixture.

-If needed, add a pot rack or pegboard. Consider adding some open shelving to display some of your favorite pieces. 

-Some folks I know have removed their cabinet doors for open storage.

-Bring in furniture- a movable island, or a dresser for additional storage may not go amiss. 

-Some people have luck adding temporary back splashes, using materials like place mats and contact paper. I've never gone that far, but I have painted wood cabinets a different color! :) 

-I like to add fun towels, pots and pans, bowls, a tea kettle, utensil cups etc. to the counter to make it more 'mine.'


Light Fixtures: 


-First off, bring in lamps. Most rooms require ~3, in my opinion. 

-Most rental fixtures are a little terrifying. Ikea offers some affordable, easy to use solutions. Most of the time I just replace them, and tuck away the old fixtures. 

-A cheaper solution? A lot of shades can be finagled into place over existing light fixtures. Use wire to tie the lampshade onto the fixture with the cover removed. Most of them have holes, making this an easy fix. 


Storage:

-Wall mount shelves. Not terribly difficult, and if done correctly, a minimal amount of repair work. 

-The Ikea Antonius system works well for us- we pulled out the bottom metal shelf of our closet and replaced it with Antonius drawers.

-Ikea Pax is also awesome (and endlessly customizable.) 


Details:

-I love painting the interior rim of the door a bright color- like poppy or sapphire- it takes almost no time, and adds a fun look to a door.

-Also on doors: If you have flat doors with no decorations, I like to cut trim and add some flair to the doors!

Looking for clients",aceiswild,41,11,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/pqate/i_laser_engrave_granite_slate_marble_tile_and/,"I laser design any image into granite, marble, slate tiles. I am looking for clientele that would want bathrooms, floors, walls, back splashes designed. I also have the capability to do this on glass, and lit with LED's to make the image on the glass glow.

I can work with 8x4.ft max size slabs, or tempered glass. I have the capability to design images that are thousands of sq.ft (Home floor plan etc).

I design your ideas, with your specific measurements so any concept or image you want, even your photos! This is all custom work. No two pieces are the same, unless you want identical duplicates.

If you provide a photo of the area wanting designed with measurements, I can design a free digital before/after concept to show you what your concept will look like! When the design is accepted by you I create a digital blueprint grid (If it were a house floor plan.etc.), then the final stage before manufacturing is a small sample to show my quality. Everything will flow from one area to the other continuously. 

Images can be done in colour. I use a patent heat dye. It is not hand painted or printed. I split the images into different colour levels. The process takes 4x longer per sq.ft than black and white. All images are done at 150-300dpi (Print quality.).

There are people that want the very best, and this is the future. My work will last 500+ years. It will never deteriorate. Images are permanently on the material.

If accidental damage were to happen years down the road, I have the images/file and will be able to replace anything that is damaged. 

Each tile is numbered specifically on the back and has to be installed properly, in order right side up, looking at the blueprint/instructions for proper instillation order. Tiles that are distributed/shipped are in order for easier installation.

It has to be a place that is easy to clean, simple, spiritual and calm.

The couch, table and carpet are a ""MUST"" because I can't afford any new once atm.  

Primary uses are movies with friends, chillout, drinking, hangout and musicproduction (I make chillout music).

There are two main challenges that I want to tackle:

1. Expanding the tiny kitchen space, and 
2. Removing or adjusting the giant block of closets at the entrance, which currently holds up a sleeping loft.  The closets make the space feel crowded and the loft currently has a head space of 3', which feels pretty claustrophobic as it's not even enough room for sitting up.

I love cooking and holding dinner parties, so a usable area for dining is extremely important to me.  Appreciate your help in advance!  Let me know if I've missed out on any important details. :)

That is, the same design concept implemented on a tight budget and with no budget. I thought it would be neat to implement something like this in a website so that people could find items/pieces at different points for scenes that they submit or are already showcased.

I called the site [Design at All Costs](http://DesignAtAllCosts.com), and I'm hoping to put up at least a scene a day. In time I'll try to showcase other interesting design concepts, but for now it's focused on Interior Design and decorating.

Feedback welcome! Or if you know of any cool design sites that have interesting scenes or that sell modern furniture, I'd love to hear about that as well.

Thanks!

We're moving into a one bedroom apartment and they said we can paint the walls! This led to my husband and I thinking about creating our dream bedroom. 

We are big fans of the movies Alien and Prometheus. We also love anything HR Giger.

[Here is an album of movie still inspiration, design inspiration, and photos of the actual space.](http://imgur.com/a/hviHt)

Basically, we're trying to make it look sci-fi, but clean. Lots of white and LED strips. I really hate overhead lighting, so we've asked them to not install an overhead light in the bedroom. It gets a lot of natural light from the big window/sliding door.

The photos of the space were taken very late in the afternoon, so they're not very bright.

I could really use some ideas for bedding because everything I'm finding online is super flowery and girly. I could also use some help finding a headboard/bed because we just have a metal frame right now. [Here's a picture of our bedroom set up right now.](http://i.imgur.com/lgChxX4.jpg)

",ref_21,38,13,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/16hqui/never_underestimate_the_power_of_some_elbow/,"When I first moved to Korea to start my teaching job, I had an unfortunate welcome into my apartment. It was beyond filthy from the previous occupant who did not seem to care at all what it looked like and had some mutant-like immunity to record-breaking mold colonies, apparently. And my landlord was less than willing to help clean it up :~/ Also - the Operating Room lighting was a strain on the soul! 

So after being here over a month, it is finally feeling like a home! 

The previous guy's existence in this apartment has been well-bleached away, and although it's still a work in progress, I'm very proud of the progress! I'm still in the market for some good art for the bedroom (those empty walls are just waiting to be filled!), but second hand doesn't seem to be a big thing in Korea, so hopefully I'll stumble upon something soon!

The main changes were: 

1) a coat of paint in the bedroom to cover up the weird giraffe-child's-safari-esque wallpaper

2) second-hand bedframe and new adult-sized mattress

3) two cool lamps with yellow LED lightbulbs (yellow lights in Korea are actually hard to come by!)

4) Just moving some of the furniture that was already here into more realistic and pleasing places (I actually took that shelving unit from the ""spare"" room aka - the school's storage room!) 

5) pictures and art from yours truly to cover up some of the bare walls in the living room!

Total cost was probably around $400 for the bed and the paint AND lamps! Of course, this doesn't take into account how much I value my spare time, but...it was time well-spent :) 

Thanks for taking a look! Hopefully it can give you some inspiration! If you have any other ideas for me on how to improve this place on a budget, I'd love to hear them!

Perhaps in a month or two as I fill up those shelves with knick-knacks and fill the walls with art, I'll post more!

I have really enjoyed being apart of reddit, especially the interior design sub. I work for Williams-Sonoma and we are running a Friends &amp; Family discount for one of our branches, [West Elm](http://www.westelm.com/). For the promotion, you get 20% off any item in store or online on a specified date range.

How It Works: 

 * PM me your email
 * I give the email to corporate. (Note this will not put you on the mailing list, though inputting your email anywhere on the site will)
 * You will get emailed the 20% discount, valid for 3 days (Oct 5-7 I think)

**NOTE** : I am not this altruistic out of the graciousness of my heart; there is a payoff. Top prize for collecting the most emails is a free couch! But I do wish to extend the discount so that you guys can get familiar with the products and become introduced to the store.

**TL:DR** : You get 20% off West Elm, I get a couch. 

**PM me your emails** ,  *comment* questions. I do not want you guys to be disappointed with any purchases.

**TIPS** :

 * The majority of our stores are in America, with stores opening in Australia, Kuwait , and London I believe in 2013. If you are foreign, and shipping is exorbitant on something, I would suggest contacting customer service. They are very willing to help, especially since it is a way of developing brand awareness.

 * Remember, to haggle in store. If something is already discounted and you want to apply your promotion discount, ask. There is plenty of wiggle room where the store still makes a profit, even with a discount. This especially works on floor models and slightly damaged items (trust me we want that shit gone, it takes up valuable space) In that vein, always ask if there is a product out of box / slightly damaged that you can potentially get a discount on (this works a lot of the time).

 * And please, don't go into a store and say ""well i_want_a_couch told me this will work on reddit"". 

Thanks Guys! 

**DEADLINE FOR EMAIL SUBMISSION IS SEP 24**

**FINAL EDIT** : Thanks guys! I hope the promotion works out well for y'all! I have added everyone's emails to the list and you guys should be getting an email shortly. The promotion runs in-store and online from October 4th to October 10th. Let me know if yall have any questions!

Probably won't get the couch sadly, i have heard of numbers as high as 2000!

1) [Dornob | Design Ideas Daily](http://dornob.com): A mixture of (domestic) designs, including homes, interiors, furniture, furnishings, fixtures, etc... highly organized by category and sub-category. Emphasis on creative/cool ideas.

2) [Design Sponge Online](http://www.designspongeonline.com/): Makes a good compliment to (1) above, with a number of before-and-after sequences for renovations, do-it-yourself projects. Somewhat more delicate/decorative aesthetics.

3) [IKEA Hackers](http://www.ikeahackers.net/): While not the best-organized of sites, it provides a lot of really neat examples of how to think outside of the box (literally and otherwise), transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary.

4) [Swiss Miss](http://swiss-miss.com): Design from a designer's perspective, with an emphasis on the minimal, typographic, ethereal and modern.

5) [DesignSpotter](http://www.designspotter.com/): A German site featuring an array of new and student works - hit or miss.

This is my first post here.  I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for a strong, **bright** LED tea light brand, or where I can find some?

I am throwing around the idea of making a little mason jar lighting fixture to set on the corner shelf above my vanity.  

I wanted to paint the jars white, maybe with a little paisley stencil of some sort if I can, but I wanted to light them with LED candles.  Being that the white paint will diffuse the candle, I need something that is reasonably bright.

The LED lights they sell at my local Hobby Lobby kind of blow, so I was wondering if anyone knew of a good place online where I could buy some stronger, brighter LED candles (or even non-flickering lights) with reasonable battery life.

I have no furniture as I'm renting right now.  I'm trying to figure what type of style of furniture I should be searching for and an appropriate budget for the amount of space I have.  The bedroom by the garage may be used as a rec room or something else.

Personally I want something clean, functional, and non-obstructive.  Initial searches suggest something contemporary or modern (is there a difference?).  I really have no interest in ""wood"" other than the floor.  I enjoy cooking, so the kitchen would be a focal point.  The kitchen will have stainless steel appliances that haven't been installed yet.

Really need help with the blinds or curtains, have no idea what is currently out there, but would want it to follow the same theme of clean and functional.

If there is anything else I missed or needs clarification please let me know.  Thanks.

   

 
Edit: Thanks for the initial insight, for the purposes of this post lets say I have a budget of 20 K.  Obviously I'm not looking to spend this amount this if I don't have to, but I don't mind spending more for a quality product.  

From a quick google search

2 bedstands

2 dressers

Small table for the eat in kitchen and chairs

Dining room table and chairs

Small Couch

Coffee Table

2 Rugs

I took some advice from /InteriorDesign and pulled the bookshelf away from the couch and up against the wall. We also hung a large mirror to decorate the long wall.  Wall coloring and/or flooring aside since I have no control over that, am I on the right track? The lamps have already been replaced since this photo was taken and the decorations/props on the bookshelf haven't been given any thought yet.

1. A layout of the space, any existing furniture and photos if possible. Are there any design 'features' you need to work around? (Like lime green carpet… or bright red walls.) If you have any non-negotiables, this is the time to speak up! 

2. A little information about how you'll be using your space-- i.e., the way you design a living room for a family vs. a living room for cocktail vs. a living room for watching TV is going to be very different. Are there any secondary uses? If you plan to use your bedroom as an office, mention it! 

3. What kind of feeling do you want to have the room to have? How would you describe your personal style? 

4. What is your budget? All out to me may not be the same as all out to me! 

Example: 
Hey, I'm redesigning my living room and need some help. Does anyone have tips? I want it to be really casual.

Hi r/InteriorDesign, I'm redesigning my living room and need some help. 

Here's what the space looks like now: (pictures)

Here's a layout of the space with dimensions: (picture) 

So there a few aspects of the room I'd like to keep. First off, we just got our couch and we love it, so that needs to stay. We also really like our coffee table, so I'd like that to stay too. We're in a rental so the walls will need to stay white, and we're stuck with the beige carpet. 

My husband and I use this room for entertaining and for lounging around, so it's important that it has a variety of seating and is comfortable. We want it to be versatile enough to host people and yet comfy enough to spend all day in. I think our style is kind of quirky and industrial. We like lots of bright colors, but follow minimalist, mid-century principles. Can someone recommend a rug, color scheme, entertainment center, alternative layout etc...We need to keep our remodel under $xxxx, and need to achieve xyz with this amount of money.

Thanks for your help!

Does anyone else have any thoughts? If we get a good guide going, maybe we can get the mods to put it in the sidebar. Looking forward to your feedback!

I've given the topic some good thought, so my questions/concerns fall into a few categories:

1) Is it too late? I'm very comfortable drawing, as I did a lot of cartooning as a kid and took a drafting/autocad class in high school, but I in no way have any formal art training. My exposure to interior design has been through the development/project management side, having worked as a construction lender and now working for real estate developers. So I have 5 years of experience with the business side of boutique/luxury hotels and destination dining, where design is highly emphasized. What's a realistic timeline for me to assemble a portfolio? How would my experience be viewed by admissions?

2) Does a post grad degree/certification make financial sense? Based on my limited research, it looks like post grad programs would run me about $80k+ for 2 years here in New York. I don't expect to receive scholarships based on my lack of art background. I'm 27 and I don't want to be burdened by more student loans through my 30's. Thoughts on this? Are there good programs for commercial/retail design for less that I should look into?

3) Is there an alternative route? Would it be possible to find work with no formal training, and possibly build my portfolio simultaneously? You hear about the occasional interior designer from a different background, but it seems like they were already artists of some sort (ie. Roman &amp; Williams). What are the opportunities like outside of the US? (Europe? South America?)

4) Who / what should I be talking to / reading / doing to get a better idea of the industry and learn the language? I've sat in on a few design meetings, so I'm learning a bit about the process. Any other resources you'd recommend?

Personally, I am interested in the design and the construction/contractor sides of the business. I want to deal with mood boards and building codes. If I could eventually find a job with a boutique firm that does that, I think I'd like that a lot. Preference for hospitality/commercial applications, but residential is interesting too.

TL;DR What's your best advice for someone who's changing careers into interior design with no formal art training?",,False,self,t5_2r5qs,False,,,True,t3_10vqaz,http://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/10vqaz/switching_careers_into_interior_design/,

1375117776.0,20,self.InteriorDesign,1jaccn,A few basic questions about rugs...,redrunner,25,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/1jaccn/a_few_basic_questions_about_rugs/,"I am ready to buy a new rug for the living room.  This is a high-traffic room in a very small apartment, and my current rug was off-white with light stripes, and it has turned out to be a very bad choice (it's had coffee spills and all kinds of other stains).  We also have cats, and the light rug shows cat fur really badly, and this is a wool rug that won't stop shedding itchy wool fibers everywhere even with several years of vacuuming.  So, I have a few questions:

**1) How do you choose a practical color that still looks nice?**  When I browsed posts about rugs in this subreddit, it seems like people tend to favor light colored rugs.  Our wood floor will be medium in color (not super dark, not really light).  Will it look awful to put a dark color rug on that? Our couch is a wine-burgundy color with goldish-green throw pillows that came with it.  We have white sheer curtains (those could be changed though).  

**2) Size and positioning?**  In the past I have always thought of rugs as a way to make the floor feel warm and not as an aesthetic thing.  I like being able to sit on the floor.  But is the rug supposed to be just in the center of the seating space, and not going under the edges of various furniture?  Right now in our room, the rug is 7'9''x 10'6'' and it dominates the small room.  Should we do a smaller rug just under the coffee table or something?  

**3)Material?**  I got this current rug for about $100 at a discount home and garden place (think TJ Maxx for homegoods, but a local shop).  It was supposed to be high quality and wear well since it's 100% wool, but we can't stand the shedding and itching.  What are some alternate fibers for rugs that would be durable and more comfortable if we don't want to do wool again?

**4) Alternatives to rugs... has anyone used carpet tiles?** On HGTV, I saw someone make a rug for a high-traffic area out of carpet tiles.  I really like this idea, because we could replace squares if there were any spills, but I don't understand how carpet tiles work--do they have to be glued to the floor?  We're renting, so wouldn't be able to do that.

I wish I could post photos of the space, but we're in the process of moving (into an identical but remodeled apartment) so I know the layout and what to expect, but our current apartment is in shambles with packing.  Any advice about what to shop for would be helpful!  Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2r5qs,False,,,True,t3_1jaccn,http://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/1jaccn/a_few_basic_questions_about_rugs/,

I don't know the first thing about interior design and I really do need some help.

Here is the [floor plan](http://i.imgur.com/JjbFleY.png).

The ""off limits"" area would typically be the living area, but I have purposed it as a home gym so that roughly 8' x 8' space is unavailable.  

Things I would like: 

* A bed - queen-sized, but that may be too big, I might have to get a futon-style piece
* A kitchen table - I usually eat at my desk, but since I'm trying to be adult-like I probably need one
* A desk - I do quite a bit of computer work so I need at least a small working area.  Right now I use two small ikea tables and an Aeron.
* Some sort of social sitting (like a sofa) positioned to see my 46"" LCD

Because of the home gym the remaining living area is very long and awkward.  I have not been able to figure out a social sitting arrangement that facilitates a TV.  The long 15'6"" wall is also adjacent to another apartment so speakers against that wall would be a problem late at night.  The bedroom is adjacent to no one except for the apartment above.

Because of the above factors I have considered just placing a kitchen table in the living area and using the bedroom as both a social and a sleeping area.

Things I have:

* Two [ikea tables](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S39903692/#/S89903699) -  23.5"" x 39.5"" - They are white.
* Aeron chair (black)
* Beige Sofa (with pullout bed) - 34"" x 72""
* 46"" LCD TV
* Crappy bookshelf (white) - 12"" x 30""

The walls are beige and the trim is white.

**Budget:  $1,000 USD**

I just started a new job so money is a little tight while I am transitioning.  In the future I would be able to spend more money, but right now I'd just like a simple social space that I can not be embarrassed about.

I like ""clean"" and ""minimalist"" designs.

Personally, I have a frame with a headboard/footboard, box-spring, mattress, bed skirt, fitted cotton sheet, flat cotton sheet, two pillows, and two shams. 

When I was at a friend's house, she had a fleece layer on her bed, despite the region being *very* hot! 

My grandmother also puts at least 10 decorative pillows on her beds. It's a bit impractical for me; do you constantly move the pillows, putting the pillows on in the morning and taking them off at night?

Should I try and stain it, or sand, fill and paint, or maybe just paint right over it leaving the lines to add some texture. 

Also what should I do about the baseboards, there are actually two different ones being used. Should I just straight up replace them or would paint be enough to make them look better. 

Another strange feature to the room is the switch plates have lines through them perfectly matching the paneling, I'm guessing these were custom made and I'd hate to just toss them out but if they cant be made to work then so be it haha.

Our ""master"" bedroom is small. We live in a 1978 split entry, about 1400 square feet. (Upstairs is about 900 square feet and then we have a finished basement at the lower level) 

We have been renovating room by room and I'd like to do something about our bedroom next.

The problem with the current setup: it's crowded! Also, the bed is in front of the radiator so it's always cold in there. We have tried putting the bed in front of the window, but the windows are old (we will be replacing them eventually but not in the immediate future) so cold leaks through. Plus I don't really like [how it looks](http://imgur.com/WddRWW7).

So i figure we have 3 options: 

Option 1: figure out another way to arrange all the furniture in the current room so it's less crowded and doesn't block the radiator. Really don't think there's a way to do this as the other walls are either too short or have the closet in the way. Tried the bed on the wall with the door and there wasn't space for 2 nightstands on either side.

Option 2: switch rooms with the 2nd bedroom, which is currently my office. It has a smaller closet and is at the front of the house (louder - street noise), but the layout of the room with the radiator/windows being on the same wall allows for a better arrangement of furniture. It is currently painted a deep purple which would need to be repainted. (Not an issue, we were planning on painting our room anyhow)

Option 3: Remove the window in the center of the wall in current bedroom. Move the bed to that wall, and add 2 small windows on either side of the bed. Cons: will be about $500 to do correctly and will be more work. But we get to keep the same room and closet. Matching exterior siding isn't a problem as we will be painting the exterior of the house this summer. We have cedar siding.

Sorry this is so long, i'm just at a loss!

Lots of logos, lots of web design, lots of advertisements. I really didn't like the marketing side of it, which is 99% of the jobs out there right now. If I wanted to be a salesman, I'd go into sales.

I'm considering interior design. Questions for those of you working professionally as interior designers:

* How is the job market?
* What did you do to get into your field (degrees, certifications, internships, etc.)
* Are there specializations within the field that I'd benefit from knowing about?
* Do you like your job?

I'll take any helpful advice. Thanks!

Studio Apartment,oov-,20,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/p2msx/decorating_a_410_sq_ft_studio_apartment/,"I recently signed a lease for a small studio apartment (410 sq. ft.), and although it sounds small, it feels pretty good for just one person.  Here's a couple pics of the place:

* [Floorplan](http://i.imgur.com/45kqF.jpg)

* [Living/Kitchen](http://i.imgur.com/MxmJ5.jpg)

* [Living - Opposite](http://i.imgur.com/Lb23g.jpg)

* [Kitchen](http://i.imgur.com/zYu10.jpg) 

Anyways, I'm moving to a completely new state and so I'm going to be buying all new furniture (hopefully used off of craigslist), so I think this is the perfect opportunity to decorate the place properly.  So I have a bunch of questions:

* Recommendations on hacks on making a small studio apartment ""feel"" bigger?

* I was thinking about using a room divider (not the foldable Asian style ones), but something more along the lines of the [Ikea Expedit Shelf](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40047675/) to help further separate the kitchen area from the rest of the apartment.  Thoughts?

* Better to match the rest of the apartment's colors with the kitchen cabinetry/tabletops or go with something completely different?

* Recommendations on color schemes?  I really dig lime green accents...

* Recommendations on furniture that's pretty modern/minimalistic?  Hopefully the pieces will be fairly popular Ikea stuff that I can grab off of craigslist.  The only things I'll need are a bed, desk, TV stand, nighstand, stools, office chair, and maybe a shelf.

* Recommendations on a layout?
