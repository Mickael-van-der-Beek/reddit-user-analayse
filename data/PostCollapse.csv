I wrote this post in /r/darknetplan and was suggested I cross-post here. I love the idea of creating ""your own internet"", especially a solar powered one. I'm still new at all of this, but this is what i've done so far, and I'd be happy to help anyone else along to build something bigger and better than mine:

[Picture of setup](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/398840_913748673415_24400384_39285423_1191148155_n.jpg)

This is it. After much learning and experimenting my wifi Wikipedia Server / messaging service is setup. It features: 

Legend:

1. 30 watt monocrystalline solar panel 
2. 30 Amp solar charge controller (supports up to 450 watts).
3. Watt's Up DC electricity consumption meter to measure actual watts / peak watts / amps going to the battery.
4. 85 Amp hour deep-cycle battery
5. Another Watt's Up meter to measure actual DC load coming off the battery.
6. 400 watt DC-to-AC inverter 
7. AC Kill A Watt electric usage monitor to measure / compare AC/DC conversion loss and track total hours / watts consumed 
8. Buffalo Wifi router with custom WRT firmware to redirect connected devices to the wifi to server 
9. Small web server running Debian, hosting a text-only offline version of Wikipedia, a web-based messaging system. (Modified NSLU2)

Stats:

* Total operating electricity consumption: ~10 watts. 
* Total cost in parts: ~$480 (including misc cabling and connectors)
* Given [5 hours of sun](http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/reno-nevada.html) the setup can generate about 150 Wh, and, factoring inefficiency, consumes about 240 Wh in a given 24 hour period (10 * 24). Starting with a fully charged battery it should last longer than a week straight meeting my requirements. 
* I could investigate adding another 30 or even 100 watt solar panel to be able to last indefinitely as well as charge phones and other devices without worry of running down the server.

I was a total noob when I started this project. Barely knew the different between AC and DC power. I also learned a lot from asking questions on [http://electronics.stackexchange.com](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/19707/powering-a-30-watt-computer-in-the-middle-of-the-desert). Very helpful and thorough guys. Though I still consider myself a noob on the topic, learning about solar, electricity, and batteries were a lot of fun, and I'd love to help others with whatever they can imagine.",,False,self,t5_2sfb4,False,,,True,t3_rgvez,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/rgvez/my_solar_powered_wikipedia_server/,

Then imagine how it would have looked from the inside. It wasn't a total instant collapse in any case. I don't think any government has ever suddenly and completely collapsed except in cases of withdrawn colonial governments and that doesn't nearly apply to any first-world country today. 

When by war, war had generally been anticipated for decades. When by resource problems (which generally caused war long before anarchy) there were long debates, monitary fluctuations, and years of slow descent and gradual removal of government services.

It won't be this shit-hits-the-fan sudden and total anarchy. you'll see government services withdrawn, gradually increasing corruption by police and government officials, less attention paid to education and infrastructure as the government works to solve immediate problems.

They kicked out the incompetent and probably corrupt local police and mayor. They replaced it with a form of tribal law, since this is an indigenous part of Mexico and declared autonomy from the Mexican state, that isn't really doing much to help them anyway.

They also armed themselves, which is why this has all worked. I think this is as good as situation as any, to show how a slow collapse into WROL will work itself out.

It's pretty crazy, but it shows how one small town in Mexico has said ""Enough!"" and fought back against the status quo, organized crime and a failing government.

- Apply seed potatoes.

- Cover with soil.

- When the potato plant grows to about 8"" high, add 8"" of soil.

- Add tires when necessary. A stack of 5-tires could yield 25lbs of potatoes.

My dad used to grow them this way. We had like 5-6 stacks. When it came to harvesting time, he'd let me try to topple them over by shoulder-ramming them. knocking them over makes for easy harvesting.

They can be kept in a cool, dark place after harvesting to cure the skin, then kept in dark (pitch black, light will cause tubers to grow) 35-40°F environment where they can keep for several months.

It's about a 2 hr drive from where I live so we will start with weekends. It also has 2 old log tobacco barns that we will be getting back in the dry. The hubby and I have been discussing who would be allowed in in a SHTF scenario. We have 4 kids (2married and 2 grand kids ) so that's 10 with just very immediate family. We also have a small group of very close, very like minded friends. If they all came their numbers would be about 20-including small children. Is that to many? Not enough? Just right? 
Opinions greatly appreciated. Oh-all the adults would be great members and bring good skills. No slackers. ",,False,self,t5_2sfb4,False,,,True,t3_pdagv,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/pdagv/just_bought_110_acres_in_rural_va_im_so_excited/,

*Safety*

I wanted to start with a short message. When you're blacksmithing there are any number of hazards you are dealing with the entire time. It's important to be aware of what they are and how to deal with them.

&gt;Issues can arise from heating metal to the temperatures required for blacksmithing. It can be hazardous to your health if proper precautions are not taken. Please be aware that I am not condoning that you do this with my information alone. Please do your own research into the subject and I will do my best to provide links to information that fills in gaps that I can not provide.

[Case Study in Metal Fume Fever. Please read the messages from other blacksmiths for more information on PawPaw and FMF](http://www.anvilfire.com/iForge/tutor.php?lesson=safety3/demo)

1. Eye protection. - This goes TRIPLE, no, QUADROUPLE, no.. I can't really express how important this is. In a survival situation you NEED your eyesight. Make sure you have some kind of ADEQUATE protection for your eyes. Goggles that are shatter proof and provide full protection around the eyes is ideal. You don't want any hot foreign materials getting into your eyes. Brightness isn't an issue unless you're dealing with an arc welder.

2. Everything is Hot. - When working with hot metal this is always good to keep in mind. If it drops, don't catch it. Hot. Need to pick it up? Gloves, pliers, or tongs. Don't touch anything without protective covering or checking the temperature with a drop of oil or water.

3. Clothing - Full cotton or wool only. No synthetic materials. Leather, steel toed shoes if available, if not make some. Leather apron and gloves. Eye protection.

4. First aid - Get yourself an aloe plant. They're stupidly convenient for burns. Break off a piece and squeeze some pulp/juice onto the wound. Burns or cuts will be your number one issue if you're not 100% careful. I have many many burns and cuts to prove it. Don't touch. Hot. Sharp. Etc. You can't afford to get frivolous injuries, but you need to be prepared for them.

5. Ventilation - If you're in a room without good ventilation you'll get carbon monoxide poisoning. Headaches. Light headed. Dizziness. Vomiting. Death in severe cases. That's why I suggest a blacksmith lean-to for your semi-outdoor needs. Preferably in a nice windy spot to keep the air moving.

I think I touched on the major stuff. Feel free to add anything you think might be useful in the comments and I'll add it.

*Tool List*

I'll be making two entries for each tool. Prepared and Unprepared.

What do you need?

[Hammers!](http://www.countryliving.com/cm/countryliving/images/CLX0305Guild001-de.jpg)

&gt;Lots to choose from, eh? Well. What kind works best?
&gt;
&gt;You want a hammer with a smooth face, no roofing hammers. Body hammers for cars work great for finishing, but you need something meatier for actually moving metal. Look for a good 1.5-2.5 pound hammer, depending on your size. I would recommend a good 1.5 for beginners.
&gt;
&gt;Smooth face and rounded edges so it doesn't leave deep hammer marks on your metal. On the reverse side you want a cross-pein.
&gt;
&gt;[This Hofi Hammer](http://images.goemerchant.net/StoreData/b/blacksmith_supply/Images/P10_Hofi_Hammer_1.jpg) shows what the pein looks like (when exaggeratedly fat.) You can find them in all shapes and sized. Round peins, cross peins (perpendicular to the shaft or parallel, preference), and more.
&gt;
&gt;Prepared:
&gt;
&gt;Hardware stores typically carry some kind of blacksmith's hammer. If not look for a ""cross-pein"". Again. Smooth face, no ridges or bumps, rounded edges and a straight pein on the back. The face can be round or square.
&gt;
&gt;Unprepared: Smooth down the face of any old hammer you've got if you have the time. If not you CAN use a rough-faced hammer. Use the same guidelines as above if-a-scavenging. Check old barns. Auto-shops. Etc.

**ANVILS**

*Oh boy. These are a must-have for any blacksmithing project. The problem is where do you find one? Acme doesn't deliver during a global disaster.

Prepared: Anvils can be mighty expensive. $1.00-2.00 per pound. Or more, and super heavy. You can't cart that around. If you've got the site prepared ahead of time, for when it all goes down, and want an anvil for some reason. Look on craigslist. Depending on where you are you can find an old one listed for cheap.

80lbs, small. 150lbs, big-ish. Anything bigger isn't needed for the work you'll be doing. 500 pounds? You're working on anchors and the like.

There are different types of anvils as well. Farrier anvils have long curved horns, while blacksmith anvils have fat horns with a straight top and cured bottom. On the heel you'll see a square and round hole in the anvil. If that is broken off, it's OKAY. But whole is better. The face should be straight and relatively unmarked. You don't want lots of holes and dings in it.

Check it out before you buy it. Bring a ball bearing. Drop it on the anvil from arm height. It'll bounce well if it is a hardened steel surface and ring like a bell if everything is solid. Cracks breed dull sounds. (Wrapping a chain around the base, putting high powered magnets on the side, and securing it firmly to a surface ALL reduce the ringing sound to a duller sound. If it isn't ringing that might be why.)

Unprepared: Train yards, train cars, etc. Car couplings make great hard steel surfaces for anvils. They're not ideal, but they're alright. Same for large pieces of track. They make great anvils on a budget. (Grab the spikes too, they're good enough steel for low-impact knives).*

**Wind Power!**

Bellows!

Prepared: You can find these online pretty easily, make sure it's solid material and not gonna catch fire.

Unprepared: Four sticks, two one-way nozzles, and an air bladder of some kind. Basic construction is fairly simple. Attach the bladder nozzles to the bladder so that one brings air in, the other out. Attach the bladder to your sticks so you can inflate/deflate at will. I can't actually offer details on building one as this is the one tool I haven't made.

**Some kind of pliars!**

Again, no teeth if possible. Flat faces. Long handles. You can order some tongs online or just use a long set of pliers. I don't recommend pipe wrenches or anything you don't control directly. Not much more than that.

**Bucket of water or oil/fat/wax**

Iron and steel behave differently when cooled rapidly. The extra carbon in steel makes it snap together much more forcefully. The result is microcracks and destabilization of the metal's structure. Fragile and likely to break. To avoid this with steel, you use oil, wax, or something similar. Don't do this without reading the advanced heating and tempering section.



*Making The Forge*

Requirements:

Pipe.

Dig a hole in the ground that's a few inches bigger than the project you're working on. It could be long, round, whatever. You just want to make sure you can comfortably sit your metal into the hole. Next dig an attached trench to the hole.

Grab yourself a metal pipe of some kind (not lead). I used a broken piece of basketball goal. Took me a few minutes to stress-break with brute force. A hacksaw would be useful for this.

If you can plug one end of the pipe put some holes along the top for air escape, if not just find a piece of scrap to direct airflow upwards.

Place the pipe in the trench and bury it so that the exhaust end is in the hole and the other is above ground. Attach your bellows to the pipe and you've got yourself a basic pit forge. This can be permanent and works amazingly well, the earth is a great insulator for heat. It's also easily moved (just a pipe, essentially) so it can be used as a relatively light weight portable forge. This would come in handy for fixing bent and broken tools.

Comments below show more in-depth methods for creating a forge, so I'm sticking to the most basic and easiest option.

He would place a barrel in the hay loft near the edge of the loft and fill it with old oil. He would then insert a piece of thick hemp rope into the barrel and let the end hang down 12 ft to the floor of the barn. There he had another barrel and the other end of the rope would be placed in that barrel. The rope would soak up the oil and it would slowly run down the rope like a capillary action siphon and drip into the bottom barrel where it would be clean and shiny as new oil. While the oil may have some wear on it (chains being broken) I have read that oil really never wears out. Most of the dirt in oil is nothing but carbon and the rope apparently removes most of this. 

I have no idea if the oil is 'renewed' and safe but it sure looked good and I never once heard the tractor complain. It is a good thing to remember after the fall and you are in need of some clean oil.

How we do this is through:

**""The Monolith Project"". A fractal repository of the sum of humanity's knowledge.** 

A layered object that carries appropriate meaning to ANY civilisation at ANY level of development, allowing them to progress to the next stage.

**The first layer** - the largest and most obvious part of this totem structure is a metal engraving showing heiroglyphs about how to create fire, use shelter, make spears, and how to progress to language.

**The next level** contains smaller glyphs. A language system - so that people can convert the glyphs to a form of language and can begin to communicate as they decipher it.

**A few levels deeper** and there are even smaller passages of written text explaining the fundamentals of science, philosophy, and most importantly, how to get to the next level. (optics)

**At this level**, we're now able to compress megabytes of data into the totem. Still plain text, but it's viewable only through crude lenses. This information pertains to how to move civilisation to a data culture.

**Now we're at a high level** wherein the plain text is encoded as microfilm style text. Countless tomes of literature and information, visible via the optical devices created from information in previous monolith layers. The data capacity on this layer is now in the hundreds of megabytes.

You can see where this is going. **Higher up still** is an optical data layer containing petabytes of data that is only able to be unlocked once society follows the instructions through to the point of being able to decode it.

Each layer of the monolith contains a greater and greater level of information. They needn't be expensive to make, should be able to stand up to the ages, and they could be scattered throughout the land, storing snapshots of wikipedia which are accessible to any civilisation regardless of how technologically advanced they might be.

They could even be sent into space, giving far more information than the Voyager golden record. 

It's the only way to really create any likelihood of protecting the human data from a full reset. (plus it's cool :)

What are your thoughts on ""The Monolith Project""?

I live in Tottenham, on the edge of Hackney. You’ve likely seen images of the three days of riots on the [Reddit front page]( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jcob8/this_is_serious_reddit_london_riots_spreading/) or the news.

Yesterday evening I went for a walk in the neighbourhood. All the shops were shut. There were angry mothers banging on the windows of the supermarket. People were furious that they wouldn't be able to make dinner.

Further drives home just how ill-prepared we are for any disruption. Supply chains are delicate and people’s cupboards are bare.
If people have a hard time going without fast food or supermarkets for one day, how well prepared will they be for a significant collapse?

Socks are an integral part of protecting them, but I've found that wearing them inside out is quite a bit more comfortable when rucking, our pleasure hiking. You can layer them with a tight form fitting sock against your feet,preferably something that wicks moisture, and another over top. This will help with blisters.

Shoes are important, but will vary on the person as to what you need. Just make sure what ever you use are broken in or your going to hate life. I made the mistake years ago going on a week hike in new boots and I hated life.

In the event of blisters the best thing is moleskin. You can get it at any pharmacy in an adhesive roll and should keep some on hand. You can puncture it to drain some of the fluid if it gets too inflamed, but you could risk infection so do so carefully.

**Announcement! The current status of /r/PostCollapse.**

You can skip this part if you're in a rush.
***

Hi everybody! We've grown quite steadily over this past year and I just want to say, keep up the good work! I've seen a lot of great content and plenty of interesting discussions posted here. I'm also amazed at the level of expertise and knowledge that people have. Along with that, the circlejerking has been kept to a minimum, there have been very few posts that I've needed to remove and you guys haven't caused any sort of drama. Keep up the great work!

Also and I should mention I've never done particularly well in English class, so you'll have to bear with me with my terrible grammar and phrasing.

**The Wiki**[](/a22)
***

Now to business. As some of you may know, the wiki is down. Now one of the huge parts of this subreddit was the fact that together, we could create a downloadable wiki that contained the collective knowledge of this subreddit. It would also include instructions on how to rebuild society. In short it would be a guide on how to turn surviving into living and rebuilding. Now this a pretty big topic, and it's pretty much impossible to include *everything* that one would need to bring yourself from the stone age back to modern civilization, but we can try. Hence the wiki. But it's down. And last I checked, I couldn't *actually* download anything. So that probably means whatever content was on there is lost. Anyways that means we've got to rebuild it. Now the original wiki appeared to be hosted on somebodies private server, which I don't have access to. So that means we've got three options.

* ~~**Screw the wiki**, just use [cd3wd](http://www.cd3wd.com/cd3wd_40/cd3wd/index.htm), [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Main_Page) and whatever .pdf manuals you've got. This would be the easiest and I guess we could make a weekly/monthly thread of things to include. However the resulting collection would end up being pretty big.~~

*  ~~**Use a SVN**. Somebody suggested using a software revision and control system to create a wiki. Github appears well suited to that. The problem with Github is the wiki tools are a bit annoying to use.~~

* ~~**Use Wikia**. I like this option because the tools are great, we can host images, it looks nice, we've got more control over content and most importantly, we can download the database file.~~

* **We've made a Wiki [here](http://postcollapse.wikinet.org/wiki/Main_Page)**

Should we go through with the wiki, I'll be making weekly threads talking about the current status and will also function as a place for you to voice your concerns or comments.

If you'd like to participate in the rebirth of the wiki please go [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/vpibi/weekly_wiki_wednesday_thread/).

**The Rules** [](/a06)
***
This subreddit has grown steadily since my last announcment and I'd like to re-iterate the rules:

* The most important being **NO COLLAPSE NEWS**. We get it, the Apocalypse is coming. Hide yo kids, hide you wife. We don't care. A collapse of society has been around the corner since the ~~1950's~~ [634 BCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_prediction) and no news or articles about that will change it or bring it any closer. You're not doing us a favour by warning us that Greece is on fire or that the EU is communist. We already know that our oil dependent economy is unsustainable. If you really want to post that, do so in /r/Collapse. I'm also not going to half assedly make a comment asking if it's okay to remove offending posts, then do nothing for a week. What I will be doing is making a comment asking what merit this post has, give the OP or anyone else 24 hours to respond and then promptly remove it.

* ~~**No linking to specific products or gear**. Now I'm kind of on the fence with this one. On one hand, we don't want this subreddit turning into the front page of Amazon but on the other hand I've seen some great suggestions for products. What's  your opinion about this? Should we make a weekly thread about must have items? Also I should mention that whatever we decided, product suggestions are always welcome as comments.~~ **All links to products, gear, or anything that requires money must be a self post.** When making a post please give a small review or reasons as to why we should buy it.

* **No Circlejerking**. Okay this isn't an official rule and not really one I need to bring up but probably should. Now this is extremely subjective so just keep two things in mind. The first being **no Zombie talk**. I'm not really going to enforce this, but I and everyone else would appreciate it if you kept that kind of stuff in /r/Zombies. 
The second I'd like you to keep in mind is **The Collapse may come in any shape or size**.  The Collapse could be as small as a food or job shortage or a large as a nuclear winter. The future might look like Cuba after peak oil or something as terrible as The Road. So when somebody asks about a particular scenario, don't belittle them and call them stupid. They're just curious.

If you have any problems with these rules, please discuss them bellow. Remember this is about what you guys want.

1346257257.0,85,self.PostCollapse,z0y2e,"For those that are considering camouflage, here's a general breakdown.",bigsol81,101,16,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/z0y2e/for_those_that_are_considering_camouflage_heres_a/,"Camouflage is a big factor in choosing tactical gear if your purpose is concealment, and there have been heated debates among military professionals and hunting enthusiasts alike as to what's the most effective. In a post-collapse scenario, you may wish to move from one spot to another without being seen, or you may want to maintain low visibility while traversing terrain during hunting or scouting. Having studied camouflage and done a lot of my own testing, here's a general breakdown of the varying types and the pros and cons.

**Military Camouflage Patterns**

First of all, let me point out that military camo is by no means your best choice. The military tends to choose broad spectrum patterns. What this means is that they try to pick the smallest number of patterns that work in the largest range of environments. This makes sense from an economic standpoint, as the more patterns you use, the more uniforms you need to manufacture, which can become cripplingly expensive when you have a large military force.

*[Solid Color Fatigues](http://www.armyuniverse.com/images/product_images/medium/5935.jpg)* - The most available option is to simply go with fatigues that most closely match your environment. Subdued green in forests, white in the snow, tan in deserts, or grey in urban areas. While this does tend to help you blend in, it does nothing to break up your outline. The problem is that the human brain is a pattern recognition engine, and an extremely good one at that, and the human form is one of the things we recognize very easily. Solid color fatigues are generally only good at making you harder to spot at long distances where the human eye would merely regard you as a differently-colored speck against a background.

*[M81 Woodland](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/BDUs-forest.jpg), [3-Color Desert](http://www.acu.com/prodimages/small2/F545421273.jpg), [6-Color Desert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GWB_choc_chip_camo.JPG)* - M81 Woodland is what most people picture when they hear the word ""camouflage"". It was used for a very long time by the military and continued being used in garrison after newer patterns were developed. 3-Color Desert and 6-Color Desert were developed due to our constant activity in arid environments in the Middle East. All of these patterns share the same basic design, which involves patterns of irregular ""blobs"" of shapes designed to break up the human outline. This camo works fairly well, but has a tendency to ""blob"" up at a distance while also contrasting at extremely close ranges, making it somewhat less effective if you are not at the correct distance. These types of camouflage are still more effective than wearing normal clothes or solid-color fatigues, however.

*[Multicam](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/MultiCam-trans.jpg)* - One of the ""exceptions to the rule"", this pattern uses some of the features of the older patterns, but uses a more advanced method of blending those colors together, as well as using smaller overall ""blobs"" of color. The resulting pattern blends more readily into a wider array of environments (from deserts to forests) and still excels at breaking up the human outline. Despite the older pattern technology, Multicam is capable of out-performing most modern digital camouflage patterns in a wider array of environments.

**Digital Camouflage**

Digital Camo is the latest trend in the armed forces (though it's more accurate technically to call it ""pixelated"", not ""digital""). By using pixelated, random patterns of colors, the overall pattern tends to more smoothly blend from one region to the next, resulting in an effect that is more difficult for the human eye to discern. The result is a pattern that works like the aforementioned M81 Woodland and other patterns, but at a wider range of distances and without the contrasting or blobbing effects. There are different ""standard"" digital patterns available:

*MARPAT* - This is the common pattern used by the US Marine Corps, and comes in two flavors: [Desert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TANKSaimingin2041102.jpg) and [Woodland](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Hagee_in_MARPAT_with_Marine.jpg). You won't find it for civilian sale since it's trademarked, but knockoffs will be just as good and will often be labeled as ""Digital Desert"" and ""Digital Woodland"" or something similar. These patterns tend to work fairly well in the environments they were intended for, but again, because they are ""broad spectrum"" patterns, they are not specialized for any one environment in particular.

*CADPAT* - This Canadian pattern is what MARPAT was based off of. Like MARPAT, it comes in two flavors: [Temperate Woodland (TW)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:India_Company,_2nd_Battalion,_Royal_Canadian_Regiment.jpg) and [Arid Region (AR)](http://www.hyperstealth.com/miltex/Aritex-45-Desert-1.jpg). The digital patterns are virtually identical to MARPAT, though coloration differs slightly, with the CADPAT woodland camo having more green than MARPAT's version.

*[UCP - Universal Camouflage Pattern](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Army_Combat_Uniform.jpg)* - This one is currently in use by the US Army, but is becoming less popular and is being phased out. It is a combination of sage green, light tan, and grey. While it was toted as a ""universal"" pattern that worked reasonably well in all environments, the truth is that it works only in a very narrow band of environments and demonstrates that there is no such thing as a ""one for all"" camouflage pattern. I have noticed that this pattern does work fairly well in scrub desert environments, especially among sagebrush where the sage green coloration blends in remarkably well (as the name would suggest).

**Civilian Market Patterns**

There are numerous patterns available on the civilian market, but the two I have experience with are A-TACS and the various commercial hunting patterns.

*A-TACS* - Like MARPAT, this pattern comes in two flavors: [Desert](http://soldiersystems.net/blog1/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/EOTAC-Recce.jpg) and [Woodland](http://www.a-tacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gen2_atacsfg_IMG_3680.jpg), referred to as simply A-TACS and A-TACS FG (Foliage Green). These patterns use a new, more organic pixel pattern rather than the squre patterns used by older digital camouflage, giving the pattern a more natural feel and allowing it to blend into most environments more readily. Obviously, A-TACS is still a more ""broad spectrum"" pattern, but it is (in my experience) marginally more effective than those in use by the military today.

*Commerical Hunting Camo* - This camouflage is arguably the best you can get. It is usually printed with actual pictures or images of the environment it's designed to work in, such as snow drift patterns, branches, leaves, and other shrubbery. It not only breaks up your outline but actually makes you appear to be part of the environment you're in. The biggest drawback to this type of camo (and the reason it's not used by the military) is that it only works in the very specific environment (and often the *season*) it was designed for. Merely moving ten miles in one direction or wearing it during the wrong time of year can be enough to render your camo much less effective. Depending on your environment, there can be as many as four different types of camo to match the four seasons throughout the year. However, as an individual, you're not trying to supply an entire army, so if you can find suitable sets of this camo for your location, this would offer the best camouflage option. [Example1](http://www.sportsmanswarehouse.com/img/callouts/mossy_oak_obsession_camo_life.jpg) [Example2](http://www.sportsmanswarehouse.com/img/callouts/mossy_oak_brush_camo_life.jpg) [Example3](http://www.sportsmanswarehouse.com/img/callouts/kings_shadowcamo_snow_shadow_camo_life.jpg) [Example4](http://www.sportsmanswarehouse.com/img/callouts/realtree_max_1_camo_life.jpg)

And that's by breakdown. Hopefully, some of you can benefit from this and understanding what options you have, and if anyone has some insight to shed, please feel free.

 [About a month or so ago, I made a post asking about what kind of direction you'd like to see this subreddit go in](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/144h1o/some_quick_questions_on_the_future_of_this/). About 16 of you replied to this and I'll be making the following changes to the rules. 

There will be a TL;DR at the bottom.

###Rule Changes

* **Links to survival gear or products may now be regular posts.** We're small enough that it wouldn't be worth a spammers time to 

* **General Collapse talk is allowed**. Seeing as how it's kinda hard to talk about Post Collapse without taking about Pre or Proceeding collapse, I won't be removing that kind of stuff on sight. Also I'm hoping you as the community won't be downvoting it on sight. But you have to keep in mind **that this is /r/PostCollapse**. However there is still the rule of **NO NEWS OR WARNINGS**. 

* **Zombie stuff is kinda allowed**. Obviously it has to have applicable information and it'll be up to you as the community to vote as you please. I reserve the right as Mod to super downvote or remove anything I don't like. 

* **Be tolerant of other people's views or attitudes.** This is kinda subjective but in general, be nice/welcome to other people, especially if they're new to this whole thing. Sure you can gently explain to them that Obama isn't going to turn America into a police state or well I can't think of any other examples but you get the point. Lots of people come here for all sorts of reasons, lets try and keep this place a warm and welcoming community.

* **Reposting or crossposting from other subreddits is allowed**. We could do with a lot more content from /r/Homesteading for example. 

I'll update the sidebar to reflect this when I'm not feeling so lazy. 

##TL;DR 
We're now becoming /r/Collapse^2 but without the news and doomsday warning crap. Sorta.

And as an afternote, a lot more people would like to see more self sufficiency links and content here.

 Also skill building posts too. Like skills and knowledge that'll be useful in any sort of Post Collapse scenario.

EDIT: Just threw this up before dinner. I was a boy scout, camp regularly and am quite well versed in survival skills. Knots, however, I was never any good at remembering. I realized this is because I don't have a daily use for them so I don't get regular enough practice at any single knot to develop muscle memory.

I decided the best way would be to have a small length of string to carry with me everywhere.

What I'm doing is picking a knot. I'm sticking to that one knot for several days doing it mirrored, upside down, backwards, whatever way seems like it could be a way I'd need it in the real world. After a few days of tying it I'll move on to another one. Every couple of weeks I'll go back over each knot without looking at a guide to make sure I've got it well drilled in.

Knots are among the single most important skill you can have in surviving tough situations. They're vital for quickly building resilient tools, shelters, weapons and just about every other aspect of utility in survival situations.

1338222786.0,67,self.PostCollapse,u8vfl,Some considerations when prepping,,87,20,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/u8vfl/some_considerations_when_prepping/,"I just discovered /r/PostCollapse and wish to share with you some of my own personal insights on the topic of prepping.

Background: Eagle Scout, educated survivalist.

* If you are physically capable of doing so, focus on creating a fully mobile set-up to survive.  After watching DoomsDay Preppers and reading through many of your posts, I see too many people basically ""hoarding"" for survival.  Let me explain... In the event of a major civilization collapse, you have to consider the following.  There are people out there with more weapons and explosives than you really want to know, who know how to use them and will if they need supplies...  This is a warning to everyone who is stockpiling supplies and hoping to ""wait it out"".  While having a large cache can be beneficial, you are otherwise painting a big red target on yourself to be ransacked and possibly killed.  It really doesn't matter how much of a defense you think you have.  

* If you insist on remaining stationary or simply have to be due to physical limitations, do not tell people about all your supplies (large food caches, ammunition, etc)!  Once again, you are only making yourself a target!  Word of mouth spreads quickly and in the event of a collapse, those who are not prepared will seek out those who they know are well supplied.  Try your best to remain as anonymous as possible. 

* Find gear to live with, not just survive.  In addition, always keep the thought in the back of your mind: durability, practicality and combined usefulness.  You want gear that will outlive you, serve several purposes and be lightweight if possible. If your home base is overrun, you need to be able to survive independently with limited gear until you can reestablish a place to call home.  I will post my gear sometime so you can see what I am talking about.

* Use your gear regularly!  Don't be like [this guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehFYAkC7CJs).  It is important to master all of your gear so you can use it effectively.  I think too many people focus on how to shoot firearms and fail to focus on just about everything else.  How many of you have a survival knife, but haven't really used it?  The easiest way to get acquainted with your gear is to try it, test it and use it until you are familiar with it.  This will take time, especially if you have little to no survival experience, but it is very necessary.

* Think about ""currency of the future"".  I read the post about a stack of playboys as being trade worthy, don't forget though, there are many people with sustainable electricity alternatives.  A 64gb flash drive full of porn might be better :P  Personally, I think knowledge will be most valuable for trade; primarily medical information, maps, and educational material.  In the event of a major collapse, many people will seek these things, but will have little to no access to this information, thus making it potential trade material for yourself.  I have been collecting and sorting through documents like these for several years now, I will soon upload a torrent and share.

* Have fun with it!  Take your gear and go camping, run experiments and practice when you can.  Prepping can be tedious and tiresome at times, don't let it consume you.

I am excited to show you some of my gear and see what you think.  I am currently in a mobilization stage, though, so I will have to wait until I reestablish a base.

[diesel swaps on yotatech forum](http://www.yotatech.com/f162/)

Most often, people are swapping the [OM617](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_OM617) from mid 80s Mercedes or various VW diesels (especially the TDI's) into these trucks for notably improved fuel economy (mid 30's for TDI, high 20's for OM617), low end torque, and longer engine lifespan

The first thing is water, you can only go about 3 days without it so this is paramount to your survival. there are plenty of sources of water availible in the wild, but you must chose carefully. never drink from still/standing water found in shallow swams and puddles. always try to gather water from moving streams and rivers. failing that you could run the questionable water through silk a few times, use iodine tablets, or simply boil it. 

The second thing is food, you can live for 21 days without eating before you die. about 14 days into starvation you will become to weak to do anything for yourself. there are five basic ways of obtaining food. Hunting, fishing, foraging, scavenging, and farming. 

hunting is made out to be much more complex than it actually is. the base principal of hunting is remaining undetected. the easiest approach to hunting your own food is finding your preys water supply. look for tracks leading to any source of water, once you've found a trail plan your hunt. animals are most active 2 hours before and up till sunrise, and 4 hours after the sun sets. find a good hiding spot and simply wait. after bagging your kill cut it open, scoop out the guts, off the head, pull off the skin, cook the rest. (NOTE: this is not the only way to hunt but the easiest, i will approach this more if there is a chapter two)

Fishing again is made out to be more complicated than it really is. all you need is a hook, and at least 4 feet of line. go look under rocks, fallen logs, leaf piles for a worm. grab the biggest one you see (dont worry, they cant bite) all you need is one. go find a source of moving water that isn't too fast. throw it in, pull it out repeat process untill you catch a fish. once you've got the fish keep it and go for another. if the fish took your worm scoop it's eyes out and use them as bait one at a time. fish eyes make great bait. 

foraging is a quick source of food given the right environment but should not be relied upon as your primary source of food. look up pine trees for bird nests that you can scarf eggs from. large open fields with gravel often have strawberry patches, mark locations of apple trees and visit them once a week instead of picking them dry the second you find them. (foraging tips based on northern united states environment) 

Scavenging is one of the few things you can do post collapse that doesn't just apply to living in the wild but works in the city as well. 
City scavenging  consists of but is ot limited to running through dumpsters, garbage cans, abandon storefronts, and vending machines. 

dumpsters and garbage cans speak for themselves. i know it sounds gross but rotten food is still food. you could pull it off once or twice a week without getting sick. try not to jump in the dumpster if you can tip it over. don't cut yourself on glass. 

abandon convenient stores will likely to have been raided but it never hurts to have a look, same thing goes for wharehouses. 

Vending machines will probably be the first things to be raided but if you've ever been to a highway rest area you'll would know that they usually have between 4 and 10 vending machines. grab a crowbar and get to work.

Farming is the long term way of producing food. lets assume you dont have any seeds. you will need to find a food plant such as corn, tomatos, squash, strawberries, ect. dig the entire plant out of the ground, be patient and dont break the roots buy pulling it out by the stem. throw in bag of dirt and take it to your concealed growing field to a hole you've already have dug and prepared. plant as many as you want. water everyday. it's not that hard. (Will post more on farming with seeds, and concealing your growing plot from raiders if there is a chapter two)

The third thing is shelter. ok lets be up front about this, society has collapsed and your not exactly gonna be living in a mansion in new york city. that will end with you dying at the hands of raiders. 

the best solution is to remain hidden. if you are in the wild you will want to find a thick grove of tall trees. (the safest place in the forest is the trees) you dont need any complicated tent and nobody will find you. you will need three 5Ft by 8Ft tarps and four ratchet straps (you know the things they tow cars with). try to stay at canopy level or at least no lower than 40 feet off the ground useing to tarps as a bottom/floor to your shelter and one for the roof.

if your afraid of heights or cant find any trees, dig a hole about 5 Ft deep by 5Ft wide by 8Ft across. use four 6Ft long stick to suspend the tarp above the hole for shade. put another sapling about ^ 1/2 Ft tall in the middle of the tent to create a peak keeping rain from building up. these tarp shelters can last for a long time if maintained right.

if your in the city the safest place would be in the sewers. make sure your know them well. don't start fires there can be methane buildups. use flashlights and glow sticks. if you have a gas mask this would'nt be that bad of a place to live.

What is the biggest threat to your own survival you will face, in those first days, and what will you do to overcome them?

For myself, I live in a small town (~4,000 people), but almost everyone heats their homes with oil - which is stored in a small facility on the edge of town, and transported by 1-2 trucks. Their stockpile, unreplenished, couldn't supply 1/2 of the current demand for the entire winter. On top of that, most oil furnaces require electrical power - without that, and as oil runs out - people are going to start to freeze. People with wood furnaces/fireplaces are going to find their homes very appealing real estate. Wood and oil supplies are going to be hot commodities. Food is going to run out, fast. 

We also have a large elderly population who are going to be dying off fast given the conditions and the cessation of medical care. Many of these frail individuals will be easy pickings for violence and burglaries. 

My biggest threat will be securing a place for sustainable warmth for the winter. Food is also an issue. Firearms and ammunition, by and large, are not, but we could quickly become targets for such. I have a bug out location, but it is not perfect.

Gasoline is available but costs $50 dollars a gallon due to frozen import channels.  Most people cannot afford gas anyway because the unemployment rate is 50% and rising.  Government and law enforcement still exist but approaching 3rd world level.  

You are patrolling the area near your home and about 1/2 mile away you see a car by the side of the road.  It is unoccupied and as you get closer you see a note sitting on the dashboard saying, ""Out of gas, out of hope, I give up take what you want""  Right now the car is untouched.

You are by yourself.  You can only scavenge using tools you have in your bug out bag right now and the jack and tire iron which are in the trunk of the vehicle.  

Here are the game rules:
1.) You can take only what you can carry.  
2.) You only get one trip - much like a carcass on the African Savannah you know there are other scavengers around, some of them dangerous.
3.) You have to explain how you will use the item you scavenge
4.) If someone posts before you that item cannot be taken again.

I reload for certain calibres (9mm, .303 British and 7.62x54R) but recently acquired a (cheap) AR. 

Here, I'd be lucky if I can find .223 ammunition for 50c a round, maybe less if I'm willing to pay $450 or so to buy in bulk. Its ridiculous. I can potentially set up my reloading gear for this calibre, but I am studying away from home and wont have access to it for most of the year; so thats unfortunately not very viable. 

The only ammunition we seem to be able to get in a decent bulk price is .22LR. Wally World (which I normally try to avoid) seems to be the cheapest, at arounds $21+tax (15%) for a box of 555. The quality of this stuff reflects the price, but rounds are rounds, and more often or not, they go bang. 

I have a .22 conversion for my AR, but only one magazine (for 22LR). Right now I'm torn between stocking up on .22LR and buying a few magazines, or splurging (maybe not the best idea) on .223

The idea I had was, in terms of .22LR, I can get alot of rounds, which are small, light, and while not the best choice for any one application (aside from small game) can be used for any if needed. As a hunter, you hear about people of old / natives shooting deer and sometimes bear, with .22 and succeeding with proper shot placement and/or luck. And where those fail, there is volume of fire. 

Would it make sense to stock up on .22LR, or should I wait (and there's the rub, as I'd like to do this sooner, rather than later) to get a larger, more expensive calibre?",,False,self,t5_2sfb4,False,,,True,t3_nlcwh,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/nlcwh/22lr_as_a_viable_postcollapse_allpurpose_calibre/,

I imagine not a lot of people have this skill and even the glasses technicians at your local eyeshop rely on powered grinders and pre-formed plastic lenses.

But how would I build a pair of eye glasses with nothing more than the right tools and sand?  It must be possible, glasses have been around since 1313.

If this doesn't exist or is incomplete I might be inclined to write up a PDF of the method after my research is done.  I'll even make a pair since that seems like a fun project.

My best friend is an optometrist who would be able to write up a basic summary of how sight tests work and how to calculate cyl (astigmatism) and all that for lenses.  When alls said and done, the next generation of post collapse babyrolls will be rocking specs too.

Seeing the Great Recession unfold in North America and the rest of the world, it makes me seriously rethink the preps I've made.  Most of these have focused on a quicker WROL scenario (food, water, security, etc).  These preps are predicated upon (and even leverage) a break down of law and order.  While these are all great preps for natural disasters, they don't help me where ill likely need it.



I can envision the economy and political institutions enduring while unemployment becomes the main issue.  I know many are already facing this.  In this situation there are LEOs to keep you from acquiring resources like housing and food in a way that you would in WROL.  Basically, you can be even more starved of resources.

**My question for discussion: what preps do you engage in to shield you against unemployment?**

Mine are:

* saving money aggressively,

* taking any job training I can get,

* networking for contacts in case I need to get a new job, and

* familiarizing myself with employment insurance policies and processes.

It takes people of different professions and puts them in a post-collapse scenario for 60 days to see how well they do. The first season took place in an urban setting, an isolated industrial area in Los Angeles. The second season was a rural area of Louisiana.

The realistic worst-case scenario leaves us looking at another Great Depression situation. There will be starvation, and chaos, and riots, but it will not last for decades and the infrastructure will not just up and disappear forever. We're not going to have to fall back to a pure barter system where the entire country is living in the middle ages again.

Realistically, you're looking at a partial breakdown of infrastructure, loss of services, and chaos in large population centers, followed probably by some form of martial law to bring things back under control. However, the worst of it won't last beyond a few years, and within five years you can expect supermarkets, utilities, and nation-wide shipping to be back up and running.

Those of you considering converting all of your money into supplies because ""money will be worthless post-collapse"", just stop. Money will become temporarily devauled if the economy collapses, but it will regain its value when the economy recovers, just like every other economic collapse in every other country. Bartering might become a temporary, localized method for exchange, but it's not going to have time to become standardized.

Those of you afraid that a collapse will result in the US being invaded can stop worrying too, because if you think that our military will simply shut down their weapons and refuse to fight just because they didn't receive their paychecks, you're delusional. 

The best advice is to strive for about five years of self-sufficiency. Whether you do this with renewable food sources or simply stockpile is up to you.

Politics aside, while most of the protests that have gained notable media attention is due to curbing of human rights as well as power grabs by various factions within the country, several other protests are starting to pop up [concerning food, fuel shortages](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/world/middleeast/egypt-short-of-money-sees-crisis-on-food-and-gas.html?_r=0). In relation to gas stations, I've seen long lines of cars surrounding gas stations angrily demanding demanding fuel. 

That same fuel is also not being properly supplied to power stations and the end result is that we have been having power outages that last from 45 minutes to an hour and half. This is only because I live in Cairo. I can imagine that those living in the outskirts or in the poorer regions they last longer. These power outages are intentionally made so that it wouldn't overload the system. With the summers coming, it will no doubt start to increase more and more due to the unquestionable need of air conditioning to cope with the hot Egyptian summer. 

Humorously enough, even the police are protesting against the interior minister citing the restricted access to firearms  so that they may defend themselves against rioters or protesters. Various police stations have decided to close off throughout the country. Because of this, various thieves and criminals have naturally taken this as an opportunity. While this hasn't happened in Cairo, a couple of incidents have occurred in one of the smaller cities of Egypt where [**NSFL**two thieves were hanged and beaten to death by a mob **NSFL**](http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_982w/2010-2019/Wires/Online/2013-03-17/AP/Images/Mideast%20Egypt.JPEG-05be8.jpg). So with that mob rule and vigilantism seems to be the way its done. Surprisingly enough, just last week in front of my home a mugger appeared and tried to snatch a purse from a woman but got caught by another mob who beat him but let him go.

Aside from all this, the economy is failing and the government is doing all it can to go after loans from various countries. Meanwhile, several restrictions have been made on the banks that prevent people from withdrawing their money, transferring it abroad or changing it another currency as the Egyptian pound is tanking. I barely managed to change my savings into US$ so that I would not lose what little I have. 

So with all of these protests, civil disobedience, lack of security as well as shortages of food and fuel, unless the Egyptians put their differences aside and get their shit together (which doesn't seem likely at the moment given how things are going), the society is decaying. Essentially things could escalate to be civil unrest, or hopefully not, a civil war. A quick google search landed me on this [link discussing levels of escalation towards civil unrest](http://www.getreadygear.com/surviving-riots.aspx). Whether this may be factual info or not, I could use it as a reference as to how things are currently going over here. I'd say that at the moment, Egypt is somewhere between level 2 and 3. Essentially most of the country is still in level but taking in some level 3 elements such as controlling the banks and money as well as police checkpoints. 

After all this background onto my story, I would like to know what I'd need to do to be properly prepared and hunker down for what may or may not come. I live in a 7 floored apartment building, owning a two floored apartment with my family. I convinced my father to at least keep a month's ration of food and about week or 2's supply of water since a year ago and we're doing fine in that regards. In the case of power outages, all we have are cheap stick to the wall emergency light that serve a very limited purpose. The security in the apartment we live in is very lax and the only ""deterrent"" we have is a porter who only watches for people who come and go. The other tenants aren't willing to invest in better security such as iron gates. 

For personal/family security, from the looks of it, a gun is not much of an option and is very limited. For the past year I have been waiting on a gun license (to which I apparently have all the ridiculous qualifications for) which has been collecting dust and doesn't seem like I'll be getting it any time soon since its the police/state security/interior ministry that handles gun licenses what with all the protests and what not. Prior to the revolution, gun licenses were next to impossible to acquire and you needed the right connections to get on. In terms of ""security"" all I have is an air rifle and a few knives. Laughable. Instead I'm looking for any suggestions on home defense that prevents someone from getting in. 

So to finalize this long read, I need help in the areas of Food, Water, Security, first aid and possibly fuel. Tips, resources, possibly gadgets. Something that would last us a good while. I mean, how long should one prepare for such a case? All i see are 72 hour/ week long disaster kits. Thank you all for bearing with me. 

**TL;DR:** Worried that my country is slowly going into a collapse that would end into civil unrest/war. Need methods, tips or resources on keeping food, water, security, first aid and power (possibly fuel) for long term. I already have resources where I can live up to a month but I need more than that.",,False,self,t5_2sfb4,False,,,True,t3_1bcrw0,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/1bcrw0/preparing_for_civil_unrest_in_egypt_or_worse/,

Any close-up attacks, we'll deal with more personally.

I'm currently studying full-time and we're not super cashed-up at this exact second, either.

So, seriously, what would you do if you were me?

Now I can't profess to have planned out or prepared nearly as much as some here, but I feel that some of the views here are absurd, namely the idea that isolation is ideal. It seems rediculous that some here mock others who suggest living on less than a certain amount of acres.  Why is it immediately presumed that bands of dangerous thugs with the intent to kill and pillage will be everywhere. Desperation will strike hard initially. People will rush to stores and loot and steal. This may continue for a couple days after collapse or even weeks. But after this time, panic will die down. Realizations will be made, including that cooperation is essential to persevering and rebuilding. Interactions betweeb strangers will have to be made very cautiuosly, but humans will not have changed to the point where killing and stealing becomes a desired way of life. Survival will mean change, but once we completely change our morals have we actually survived? Now I have an apartment in New York and a house about an hour away, in a town of 5000. In the event of Nuclear War I will likely be screwed. Anything else, my first step will be to unite neighbors and friends. Work together to secure supplies with the promise if shared perseverance. Once this has been done, we go to the city. The apartment can serve as a staging area, and anyone taking shelter inside is welcome to join, though with caution. The eventual goal is uniting as many people as possible and rebuilding.  Supply scavenging will be run and specialists in specific fields will be given what they need to work to their potential if at all possible.  If another group is met the goal is to unite. Conflict needs to be avoided.  If the leader of the other group is somewhat reasonable he or she will realize that no threat is intended and that cooperation can lead to success. This continues until society is rebuilt.

Before anyone says that this is some idealistic, poorly thought out plan understand this is not some in depth way to survive.  This plan or anything similar will find difficulties countless times. The point is this: 

I intend to meet aby crisis such as this head on and attempt to unite humans or die in the effort. Survivng by youself with a policy of shoot then ask questions means becoming something that is not human. I would rather die than become that.  
Humanity has flaws. Some will become more prominent during a collapse. These can be beaten, and I thoroughly believe that  if the effort is made the moral sacrifice can be made small and temporary. And if I fail, I can only hope that others will do as I did and strive fir the survival of humanity. Not individuals. 

TL; DR Humans won't need change to the point where morals are replaced by survival instinct.

* Fishing line: Yes, fishing can be useful other than fishing or snare line. If you have a cut that needs stitching cotton thread from a sewing kit can hold bacteria better. Just put some hand sanitize or alcohol pads on the fishing line and stitch yourself up. Also, cotton thread is more painful to remove.

* No Collapse news or warnings. Take that stuff to /r/Collapse. 

* No general collapse talk (stories, news or warnings), that's for r/collapse.

These rules have always seemed fairly misguided. 

I'm not sure how you can separate discussion of what comes after the collapse without discussing the features of a collapse.

How the collapse is likely to play out is *absolutely germane* to any discussion of what to do after the collapse.

Even suggesting that there's a solid distinction between the collapse and post collapse undermines the discussion for those who see the collapse as a *process*, rather than an isolated *event*.

Also, the stated goals of this subreddit include the wiki that will teach people ""*what to do* ***during*** *a catastrophic event*"".  Hard to do this the way the rules are outlined.

I suggest the rules ought to read somewhere along the following lines:

* No Collapse news or warnings **without contextualizing the discussion to adapting and dealing with the world** ***post collapse***. ~~Take that stuff to /r/Collapse~~ For specific discussion and news isolated to the collapse, please see /r/Collapse. 

* No general collapse talk (stories, news or warnings)  **without contextualizing the discussion to adapting and dealing with the world** ***post collapse***.  ~~That's for r/collapse~~For specific discussion and news isolated to the collapse, please see /r/Collapse.

Let's get started. 
Advanced Hunting consists more of trailing and stalking your prey than simply waiting for it to walk by on it's way to the local watering hole http://i.imgur.com/bsZbJ.jpg. 

Many people will dwell on having a rifle or shotgun for hunting in the post collapse era. that's all fine for the first year or so but once the prey become aware of your presence they will migrate away from the normal lands they are found in. it is best for long term survival to make each kill as stealthy and undetected as possible. one of the best ways to achieve this is to use a crossbow or better yet a compound bow for large game such as deer. coupled with fullbody camouflage that can be found at most any walmart or sporting goods store. (now is the time to start stocking up on supplies guys)

Like most nocturnal herbivores deer see mostly through movement. the trick to sneaking up on them is remaining quiet, and slow moving. Man is the only being in the woods that makes a constant *thump thump thump* while walking. deer know this, so take three or four steps and stop for about 30 seconds and look around, then repeat. keep circling the the watering hole that animals frequently visit. animals are most active 2 hours before and up till sunrise, and 4 hours after the sun sets. 

For small game i recommend a nice silent high powered pellet rifle. failing that a 22. is acceptable. small game are not often seen far from there primary food source. a patch of acorn trees serves as a good place to stake out an await that rabbit or squirrel. don't limit yourself to acorn trees though, small game can be found almost anywhere there are crops growing. 

You also might try luring your prey into you, this will result in you bagging scavengers such as crows, buzzards, and the occasional 
coyote. for crows and buzzards all you will need is a knife and a dead fish about 5-12 inches long. Go to a field, dig a shallow grave you can lay in. place the dead fish on your chest and cover yourself entirely in in a thin layer of dirt leaveing only your eyes and the fish showing. keep the knife in your hand and simply wait for a unsuspecting bird to land on your stomach expecting a nice fish dinner.

For larger scavengers like coyotes and coy dogs you can leave a dead animal carcas in the middle of a field. between midnight and 4 am would be the best time to sit and watch the carcas. (this is when coyotes are usually most active)


Farming your own crops from scratch is much more easier to accomplish than most people think it is. the first thing you will need to do is decide wether your crop will be in the ground or in buckets, if you chose buckets your job is pretty simple. drill a hole or two in the bottom of your 5 gallon bucket, fill the botom of a bucket with about an inch of pebbles and fill the rest with dirt. plant one seed per bucket and give it plenty of water and sunlight everyday. If your growing crops in the ground pull all the grass and weeds exposing the dirt around your growing area. (mine would be 30Ft by 30Ft but more on that later) once you've exposed all the dirt in your growing plot you will now have to free up the gravel by raking or tilling up and removing the rocks in the soil.once you've got between 2-3 inches of good soil you can start planting your seeds. (it's easier to maintain and harvest your crops if you plant your seeds in rows) plant the seeds about 4 inches deep, cover with dirt, and water upon planting to get them started quicker. keep all your plants about 8-10 inches apart to allow them room to grow. That's about all there is to farming. remember! this is post society, crops will be scarce NEVER tell anybody that you have food growing. 


Concealment is one of the most valuable skills to have in post society. one of the best things you can stock up on is camouflage burlap. it's sold at walmart, you get 12Ft by 6Ft of camouflage pattern burlap for about 12$. you can make almost anything form this stuff and it's durable too. don't bother with a needle and thread just use safety pens to pin lots of cut up burlap strips to a bag or backpack and you got a hiding place that only you know about, simply toss in a bush and forget about it. 

Hiding crops will be a bit more difficult, if your grow plot is on the ground you will have to transplant small pine trees and bush,s to the surrounding area of your crops. try to make it look like nothing more than a thick overgrowth. (NOTE: small saplings and fern plants can conceal just about anything if you use enough of them)

If your crops are in buckets to can paint them green and black or just wrap camo burlap around them and hang them in the tops of trees.

If you have any questions please ask, i will do my best to answer.



(I will go over more subjects including: waterproof concealment techniques, evading capture, raiding of supplies that don't belong to you, bartering/placing value on item in post society, and much more if there is enough interest for a Chapter lll)

I live within a few miles of a amish community and they do not like dealing with our currency if it be paper money or coins. the only use it has for them is buying things from our local businesses if they need to other than that they like to exchange foods or services we let them cut hay off some of our unused land and they bring us fresh produce (cucumbers tomatoes strawberries) and have even repaired several sets of work boots for us restoring them to better than new condition.

So this is something that I picked up in scouts. Each of us was given one when we went on our first long-term backpacking trip. It is a 25 cc glass flask that contains a few iodine crystals. (a few grams maybe? not sure exactly how much) You fill the flask with water and wait about 45 minutes, and it becomes a saturated solution of iodine and water. 5cc's of this will purify one liter of water. you pour in 5cc's and wait 45 minutes (1 hr if cold) and it's ready to drink. So basically it works exactly like the iodine tablets *except* it lasts essentially forever. I have had this same bottle for about 5 years and estimate that i have purified *at minimum* 100 gallons of water. (a closer estimate is likely 200-250 gal.) And, in the whole time i have had it, I have never noticed an appreciable decline in the number or size of iodine crystals. I haven't done the math to see how much water it could purify, but i suspect somewhere in the thousands of gallons. So compared to pills i think this is a great option for a PC situation.

Edit: So apparently crystal iodine is a DEA-controlled substance, which is why you don't see many people using this method. However, this youtube video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydYMZKgn9pE courtesy of doom-douche, demonstrates how to make crystal iodine if you so desire. I do not know if this is legal.

Because everything tastes better with salt, and salt is very important for the preservation of food in a world without refrigeration, then it seems to me that wherever it is possible to produce salt is going to become an important place, especially if it's near trade routes.

You can't evaporate large basins of salt water without some good sun and heat. So ... where do you think the salt production would happen, postcollapse?",,False,self,t5_2sfb4,False,,,True,t3_xqo5h,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/xqo5h/salt_in_a_postcollapse_world/,

We all seemed to be in agreement regarding them, so here's a quick update on what we decided for those who missed it.

* **No Collapse/The End is Nigh News**. Only had to remove one post so far.

* **Links to products,services and/or pretty much anything that costs money have to be self posts**. When you make a post, give a short description, review, or reason why we should buy it. All posts made before this one will be grandfathered in.

* **[The Wiki is up and running](http://postcollapse.wikinet.org/wiki/Main_Page)**. As we are starting from scratch, there's going to be a very noticeable lack of content. Hopefully you guys can help change that.

[](/b31 ""Oh and when you're making a post, IT MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN IT! No completely blank posts. That just confuses people."")

That's all, carry on with your day.

edit* I forgot to mention, people posting unhelpful, rude, inappropriate comments. Please don't. Especially comments like ""Good god, fuck Australia."", ""Whatever, you'll wind up in my post apocalyptic harem anyway."" and ""You'll be long dead before that"" aren't helping anybody and just bring the quality of this place down.

Fence-walls are a must.  They define you community, and offer protection.  A good wall will mean that the houses within do not need to be individually defended.  

However the resources needed to make a 12' wall, of four sides, each 100' long, are huge.  That's a pretty small footprint.  

So, my questions to everyone is how would you approach making said a wall using only postcollapse materials/tools.

Hedge rows making a living wall are an option, but take years to fill out.  Osage can grow into a very formidable barrier.

Food is a major problem in a survival situation. I'm going to mention some of the things that most people do not consider edible, but actually is, in a SHTF scenario. Keep in mind, anything I mention here is *something I have eaten.*

**Reptiles**

- Most lizards are very, very edible, and taste like a cross between fish and chicken. Cut off the head, gut the lizard. The innards fall out almost as cleanly as those of a fish. Leave the skin on - it will char and curl away from the meat. Cook spitted on a stick, over open flame, for at least half an hour. As there are very few diseases easily transmittable from lizard to human, no worries about food-borne disease - you're cooking it to make it tasty, not for disease. Undercooked lizard tastes horrible. Eat spitted, and discard the skin as you go.
- Snakes require some knowledge. First, on a snake 12"" or longer, regardless of venom, cut 4"" below the head. Snake mouths contain horrible bacteria. Venomous snakes keep their poison sacs near the head. Be careful handling the head - even after decapitated, the head can still bite - bury it. Hang the beheaded snake from a tree branch and let it bleed. Cut the entire stomach open - the innards will be obvious, and can be craped out. Once you've made the belly incision, the skin peels back with only a little work (peel from the head side upward). DO NOT BOIL THE SNAKE WHOLE. Snake bone marrow stinks like hell if boiled. If making stew, cut the flesh off with a knife first. Otherwise, just roast over open fire. Tastes a LOT like chicken, and I've eaten two different species of rattlesnake, and a large garter snake.

**Mammals**

- I have eaten rat. It wasn't bad. Same with guinea pig.
- Squirrel varies, according to some dialogue I had in this subreddit. I dislike it, but would eat it if it meant life or death.
- Cat tastes horrible. Avoid it. This means both domestic and wild. Bitter, not fun to eat. 
- Dog isn't much better. Very gamey. Only in a life or death situation.
- Turtle is pretty damned good. Tastes fishy, like catfish, with a stronger consistency.
- Easy ones that taste good: Rabbit, deer, possum, alligator, wild boar, nutria, antelope, ostrich.
- Pigeons and doves are fucking tasty.
- Bat is delicious, but you have to make sure it's from a domestic source. Wild bats have that whole rabies thing going on.
- Bear and lion have led me to believe that any major carnivore is gross. I'd eat it if it meant life. Blugh. Bear Bacon is absolutely gamey, and hard to swallow.
- Donkey, OTOH, was goddamned delicious. So is goat. I expect, thereby, that horse meat is also quite palatable.

**Other:**

- Earthworms aren't bad if you fry them in butter and crack an egg on it. Same for mealworms and locusts. They are crunchy, but it's a lot of protein.
- Forests contain a plethora of foodstuffs, provided you can identify what's good to eat. Pine nuts, wild onions, even acorns can be prepared nicely. Be careful, exceedingly, with fungus. Also, the lining of tree bark is genuine fortified with vitamins.

- Wild beehives can be taken, by experts. My personal philosophy is to leave that shit alone. A mistake will hurt like hell.
- Always, *always* cook what you're going to eat. Most insects and wild animals can host various horrible parasites and bacteria. Eat nothing raw, unless you have no choice. Learn to build a fire from scratch, because raw food can kill you - worse, it can make you suffer horribly before you die.

**Survival in a environment relies upon the simple concept of adaptation, not the ability to lead, teach, know how to survive in a certain scenario, etc.** A proper PostCollapse guide should focus simply on the idea of being adaptable, and less on specifics - why? Because it's so much more efficient. Sure, you can add appendices that will clarify on how to apply the basic concept of adaptation to SPECIFIC events - but it's purely imaginative and inefficient to guess what the collapse will be, because you have no damn clue what it will be. You're a million times better off preparing yourself through the ability to adapt, rather knowing which guns to have, which foods to make etc. This is merely because a fair amount of survivalist manuals and information out there is pure bullshit, selling the idea of ""grungy camping"" and not the idea of efficiency and adaptation for survival. This especially ties in the joy and idea of being a leader to a survival of mankind. **Throw that shit out the window, being a hero will get you nowhere in a Post Collapse world.**

I honestly think the wiki in its current state is a waste. It need to be redone in a more easily editable and read-able form (aka mediawiki) and focus on the idea of adapting, and having a variety of skills - not about specific survival scenarios, and a lot of bullcrap that you'll probably end up forgetting. It can of course note all the fun stuff such as knowing how to get electricity, hot water, and other great ammenties - but it should focus on the idea of knowing the VERY BASICS - and adapting in an environment to ensure you are healthy. That's what the survival books are written as, and it's what makes them timeless and universal. I'm NOT dissing the idea of adding in such special skills - but in the weight of priority so many things (so far unspoken for) are far greater in importance.

FYI [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/kru75/dammit_zombies_arent_real/) is a perfect example of what this subreddit is becoming - a game. It's like those UFO clubs - people come in acting serious and then just end up screwing around and treating it as a game

if you can prove me wrong, go ahead. Otherwise i'm more than willing to start writing the first few chapters to elaborate on what i'm talking about here.

Keep it digital then the huge problem is the amount of electricity that is needed for this option to be consistant. (I wouldn't pick that one). Same problem for laser and compact disk.

Print in form of paper notes or microfilm texts and partitions. huge volumn needed and quite subject to several danger + you wouldn't be able to ""enjoy"" unless you play it yourself. (Wouldn't pick that one either.

So we prepare ourselves with Katadyn filters, stainless steel pots/bottles for boiling, and water treatment tablets/drops such as chlorine.  These are all great treatments to purify water from the most common contaminants (filters may not protect against viruses).

What this ignores is the fact there are different pollutants you potentially can find in water besides organic ones: inorganic (heavy metals, chemicals) and radioactive pollutants.  Boiling will only concentrate inorganic pollutants as the clean water boils away.  Chemicals to treat against organic pollutants will only add to the soup of chemicals, and a far more sophisticated filtration system is required to filter out these contaminants (reverse osmosis, carbon filters…) which are generally expensive and bulky – not ideal for evacuation/bug-out bags (although good for sheltering in place). 

If, like me, you can’t afford a sophisticated filter in your evacuation system, then I recommend you plan on taking along some of [these]( http://www.amazon.com/SenSafe-Water-Metals-Test-Kit/dp/B001768RHY/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344997185&amp;sr=1-2-catcorr&amp;keywords=sensafe) or a similar testing system. This will allow you to test the content of water before you chose to expend resources to purify the organic contaminants.  If the water has heavy metals, move along and find some that doesn’t.

Does anyone do this? Do you have to have a good system of rotation, to make sure that you never have one which goes over the expiry?

Simply tear the skin close to the genitals and pull off the hind section of the skin down to the ankles. Then pull the top portion of the skin up and over the head while holding either at the hips or hind legs. Once you get it up with the neck exposed twist the head around a couple of times until you can pull it off. Then you can pull the leg skin down and break off the legs.

With the rotation of the Earth it would only knock out half the world (give or take). Also, would the tilt of the earth have an affect on whether the northern or southern hemispheres would be affected with this?

I have decided upon a rifle I am buying myself for Christmas... well because *I want it* basically, but I tell my wife it's for Christmas.  I am buying a [Saiga Sporter rifle](http://i.imgur.com/ALN5S.jpg) in .223/5.56 or 5.45x39 or 7.62x39 (Yes I will be converting it.)

Anyway the model of the rifle isn't really important, but it's what started me thinking hard on what calibers I wanted to stockpile and whether or not there was any validity to the theory that using common calibers is a good idea.  I'm not sure that it is.  I don't see having a rifle in a common caliber being much help if I run out of ammo at my home.. I think that in any sort of emergency situation the shelves of all my local stores would be cleared of any and all ammo in short order.  Chances are good all that will be left are *uncommon* calibers that no one has a use for.  Anyone remember the ammo drought before Obama was elected?  

So for this reason my decision is mostly between .223 and 5.45x39.  .223 is obviously very common.  5.45x39 is dirt cheap, half the price of the .223.  I can pile up thousands of rounds of 5.45 or far less .223.  

.223 is produced locally even though it's more expensive.  My only source for 5.45 is Russian so I would have to stock up a lot of it.  

7.62x39 is sort of in between.  It's popular enough in the USA that there are domestic companies making it.. but the prices I'm finding are on par with .223/5.56 so it's not a very attractive option for me.  I'd rather have either the benefit of dirt cheap so I can stock up, or extremely common so it's widely available.  Which way did you go?

A central part of my collapse preparation has been food preservation.  Personally, I've been focusing on canning and drying.

While I plan on doing both, canning seems to be more effective and possibly easier.  Home canned goods can last for years, and using a pressure canner, one is able to can anything, including meat.

However, in order to guarantee a perfect seal, which is necessary for the canning process to work, it is strongly recommended that you use the cheap little metal lids with rubber seals only once.  Unfortunately, I could see that possibly being an issue post collapse.

Does anyone have any idea how to overcome this obstacle?  Jars and the metal bands that hold the lids are reusable for basically ever.  It's just the lids that are the problem.

The lids and bands that I'm talking about [look like this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dw-fFshIzoU/TvTWNyr6TaI/AAAAAAAAAgU/RCCsEnb-0VQ/s1600/canninglids2.jpg).  A company called Tattler does make [reusable Tattler lids](http://www.reusablecanninglids.com/store/index.php/shop/200-pcs-bulk-mix-reg-and-wide-mouth-100-each.html), but I get the impression that one still has to replace the rubber bands, seeing as how they are basically the exact same thing as the rubber seal on the metal lids.  There's also the [old style zinc lids](http://www.cyberattic.com/stores/sandridgefarm/items/772474/catphoto.jpg), but they too use a rubber band that I believe needs replaced.  In addition to that, while I can find zinc lids all over the place at flea markets and such, I can never find the rubber seals that are necessary for the lids to work.

Basically, does anyone know of a reusable method for canning or for a way to reuse the modern disposable lids?  Alternatively, are either the Tattler or zinc lids actually reusable, including the seal, and I have just heard wrong?

I know I can stock up, but to me, that's just a short term solution.  For a real long term solution, I need something that is reusable.

Thanks,

We have 800 bio degradable dog poop bags to crap in and then bury or use for fertilizer. We have ten of those blue water barrels buried behind our house.

If these were to be vacuum sealed and placed in a pelican case.  Let's even say I can fill the pelican case with nitrogen.  The pelican cases would then be buried approximately 6 feet/2 meters underground.

Let's say I have a weeks worth of food for 10 people.  The idea would be in a true SHTF situation in which my house and normal storage are inaccessible (for any reason, it doesn't exist anymore, it's occupied, it's contaminated, &amp;c).  The stash would be buried somewhere accessible by foot from my house, but not within a 10 min walk from the house.

Additionally basic tools (a multitool or two, knife or two, screwdriver/hex set, &amp;c), first-aid supplied, small book on native plant species, hand-cranked shortwave/AM/FM radio, hand-held two-way radio and batteries, tarp, paracord, space blankets, and some hygiene products in pelican cases.  Without water or Oxygen (Nitrogen packed), these should last indefinitely.

Considering the idea behind this cache, I was also thinking a pistol and ammunition would be prudent.  Those should last near indefinably as well, especially under the conditions I'm planning to pack these in.

Some other items I've been thinking would be useful would be water purification tablets or filters.  Since those food packets don't have a ton of water in them, I assume we'll need water. I would estimate around 25gal/133L of water for 10 people for a week.  The area around me does have some lakes and streams and is prone to a lot of rain.  I would guess I should be fine when it comes to water? (even food shouldn't be a huge problem (hunting small game and forging for berries) as long as it's not winter (we get snow and a good bit of cold))

All of these cases would be packed in a large pelican case, which would be buried approximately 6 feet/2 meters underground.  That should keep it properly shielded from the elements and at a constant temperature.

Is there anything I'm not thinking of?  Are there better ways to do what I want?

These strategies envision a declining society, but not necessarily a fully collapse society in which key resources become extremely scarce and violently fought over. 

The challenges I deal with here are rolling black outs, food shortages, water shortages, fuel shortages, extreme weather, crime/violence, diminished access to health care, diminished access to education, and mental illness.

There are at least 2 challenges I am at a loss for providing input on that are and will continue at increasing rates to plague our society: unemployment and inequality.  I have some ideas, but they are politically sensitive and likely unpopular on this subreddit so I’ll let others comment as they see fit.

My personal philosophy is less “survivalist” than “transition/thrivalist”.  I believe we need to take an active interest in meeting the challenges our society faces as opposed to running from the problem into the hills with ramen noodle stockpiles and guns. 

I’ve tried to leave some resources to get people on the right foot, but I confess I haven’t fully investigated them so I do not vouch for them.  They are just starting points for further research and development.

I wish you all the best, and encourage constructive feedback.

**Rolling Black Outs**

* Regularly back-up data.

* Invest in [off-grid]( http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/living-off-the-grid.htm) renewable energy such as [solar/thermal/electric](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/z04kx/strategies_for_a_postpeak_oilclimate_change_world/c60edjv) (*credit: deepgreen*) or wind to *supplement* your home (no need to go extreme and live fully off-grid).  

* Have solar power back-ups for electronic devices.

* Take-up [bee-keeping](http://basicbeekeeping.blogspot.ca/) for a source of wax for candles/light sources (and carbohydrates).

* Learn and make use of skills and technology for [keeping food cold without electricity](http://agreenliving.net/cooling-food-without-electricity/).

* Stock-pile batteries and have a generator handy.

* If possible, become part of the amateur radio community to ensure you have the information you needed in case of grid crashes.

**Food Shortages**

* Learn gardening, even [container gardening]( http://www.container-gardening-for-food.com/)  for apartment dwellers.

* Learn [food preservation](http://www.univet.hu/sc1/feltoltott/425_1272276559.pdf) techniques such as canning and food dehydration.

* Support local farms and food producers by shopping at farmers’ markets.

* Learn [composting methods](http://web.extension.illinois.edu/homecompost/methods.html).

* Stockpile long term food stores and rotate your supply.

* Learn, develop and practice hunting and trapping skills.

* Learn (from an expert) about and practice urban foraging.

* Invest in organic heirloom seeds stocks and learn to collect the seeds from your crops.


**Water Shortages**

* Stockpile bleach for water purification (among other uses).  (Remember that bleach turns to salt water after a year or so, so keep your stock rotated).

* Stockpile water

* Learn other methods of water extraction such as [rainwater collection](http://www.rwh.in/).

* Invest in a [still](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oHrDdrXDro) to produce your own water.

* Invest in a [reverse osmosis system](http://ampac1.com/Reverse_Osmosis_Residential.htm) that can purify salt water and polluted water and reuse “grey water”.

* If possible, relocate to an area with abundant natural fresh water.

**Fuel Shortages**

* Invest in cycling and learn skills to repair your bicycle. (Remember to be safe and wear a helmet and high-visibility vest with fluorescent colours and retro-reflective material).

* Investigate options to telecommute to work if possible.

* Invest in a hybrid vehicle or vehicle with high fuel efficiency.

* You may want to invest in [Diesel](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/z04kx/strategies_for_a_postpeak_oilclimate_change_world/c60fujf) in order to run it off vegetable oil, or stick with [gas](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/z04kx/strategies_for_a_postpeak_oilclimate_change_world/c60icwe) engines and convert your car to a wood gas burning engine. (*Credits to the-fritz and DeepGreen*).

* Invest in energy efficient insulation for your home.

* If possible, relocate to a home that is as small as you find comfortable to reduce heating costs.



**Extreme Weather**

* Have a good solar/dynamo radio.

* Identify weather risks – both current and projected – for [your area](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/z04kx/strategies_for_a_postpeak_oilclimate_change_world/c60et02) (*credit:SMTRodent*).

* Make a household [emergency plan](http://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/plns/index-eng.aspx) including emergency exits, escape routes, safe meeting places near home, meeting places away from home, and develop a [bug-out/go bag](http://survivalcache.com/bug-out-bag/) with supplies for all family members. Ensure you have all documents and contact information needed to restart your life.

* If possible, become part of the amateur radio community to ensure you have the information you needed in case of grid crashes.

* Have a “get home bag” at work and in your car.

* Always have your vehicle tank at least half-full

* Begin to invest in liquid cash assets you can access at any time.  Think of what cash is needed for a week in a hotel plus food when the local power is out and bank accounts can’t be accessed.

**Crime/Violence**

* [EDITORIAL] Many on this subreddit know that I’m no fan of guns. I recommend you remember that the gravest threat in a war zone is not violence but disease.  In other words, don’t be an irrationally obsessed gun-hoarder motivated by fear and hatred.  You’ll lose your soul, without which, survival is undesirable.

* If you choose to have firearms, learn to use them safely, practice regularly, licence them/yourself for them properly and legally, and store them safely.  And learn proper maintenance.

* Consider non-lethal self defence methods including dog spray.

* Take self-defence training such as krav maga and practice it regularly.

* Ensure that you know your neighbours and have close ties with them.  Expand your social network and social capital.

* Invest in a [canine companion](http://petsplayground.com.au/articles/dogs-deter-burglars-say-nrma/index.html) as houses with a dog are statistically safer from burglary.


**Diminished Access to Health Care**

* Take first aid, wilderness first aid, EMT training up to whatever level you can afford.

* Maintain as healthy a diet as possible.

* Exercise regularly.

* Get regular vaccinations. 

**Diminished Access to Education**

* Save money and invest in your local public library and home library.

* Focus on both practical and worldly knowledge (I.e., gardening and philosophy).

**Mental Illness**

* Maintain strong, healthy relationships

* Practice a form of self-expression such as music, art, etc.

If your bug out plans are to get somewhere other than where you're at, you're gonna have to be on the move.  Eventually no matter how long you hunker down, there might be times you gotta be on the move.  You have to not only have a good Post Collapse plan at least as far as bugging out goes if need be, and skills and tools to continue on, but you have to be fit.  You can have the best plans in the world, but if you're winded walking to the bathroom and back, you're gonna have a bad time executing them.

What do you think is the best way to get fit enough to execute you post collapse plan, assuming you don't have a bunker in your back yard or a hidden safe room in your house?

Personally, I think everyone could benefit from a triathlon or two.  Swimming could be an important skill to have in and of itself, considering that in the case of natural disasters, water is often everywhere.  Furthermore, swimming is probably one of the most taxing activities you can do for exercise; you use virtually every muscle and you tax your cardio system.  Swimming is probably the most simple form of a well-rounded exercise form that works all of the muscles of the body.

Then we move onto the bike.  Bicycling or horses may very well become the fastest means of getting from point A to B in a post collapse scenario.  EMP's could disable many cars, those that could survive an EMP (if possible) would eventually run out of gas and getting more fuels will become increasingly difficult, even if we're not talking EMPs.  Eventually as we rebuild, there may become solutions, but initially, bicycles might be the most available forms of mechanical transportation and it's going to be important to be able to travel long distances on one.

Finally, running.  I think that the ability to travel far on foot is probably going to be one of the most valuable skills in a post collapse scenario.  There's going to be times when using a bicycle won't be an option, or when traveling roads is too dangerous.  Sometime we might have to use little out of the way roads or even game trails (depending on where you are and where you want to get to) and sometimes the shortest path will not be a safe option.  Obviously in a post collapse scenario running isn't usually the smartest way to get to point B where food availability and caloric efficiency is concerned (although walking and running consume about 100 calories each, with maybe 10 extra calories burnt while running to compensate for faster heart rate, the bodies need to cool itself faster), but running also requires more water as our cooling systems basically use the sweating method.  But knowing you can run pretty far gives you the peace of mind that you can walk a lot further and get a little faster when needs be.

Anyone care to share.  Am I full of shit?  Do you think you have a equally important or better approach to getting fit?  I'd be interested in your thoughts.

So, I'm trying to find information on installing a rocket stove on a boat. Does anyone have any experience with this? 

Some questions that have come to mind : 

Is it a pain storing wood on board (seems like your old propane locker would be ideal), are bugs an issue, or humidity? 

Does driftwood ruin the stove (with salt)? 

Does the stove heat and cool too slowly to be useful except in extremely cold environments? 

Do sparks ruin your sails? 

Does water infiltrate the boat, or excessive heat ruin the deck? 

Is it a fire hazard? 

So many questions...

Also, has anyone ever implemented a rocket stove on a boat? I've been doing extensive searches, and have yet to find a proper installation. I'm half tempted to make one, either by modifying an old Dickenson Diesel stove, or by building my own. It'd almost certainly have to be a vertical feed (due to heeling while underway). It's tempting to run the exhaust along the length of the boat with some thermal mass, which also makes use of an existing diesel heater exhaust port, but not if it's going to be a fire issue, or corrode. Also, is stainless the proper material for a marine rocket stove? Perhaps cast iron, even enameled cast iron?

There have been several complaints from both posters and mods about what this subreddit is about. Originally it was created with the intention of **How to survive and rebuild society in a Post Collapse world** and to **Create a wiki** which can be downloaded and distributed in that event. 

However this subreddit has grown quite a bit and while we're all happy to have new members this is starting to turn into r/collapse2. So things like [How to deal with the internet if it got censored](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/jhm56/what_would_you_need_to_know_to_set_up_access_to/) or [How do I better prepare my house for doomsday](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/jgjum/hometerritory_preparation/) (no offence to both of you) aren't exactly what this subreddit is looking for. That's more like r/collapse stuff. That being said, I do enjoy this kind of discussion so if you *must* post that here, please first post it in r/collapse and then post it here *if* r/collapse didn't help or you would like additional ideas and/or help.

Next is what we don't want. Political [circlejerking](http://redd.it/je7rd). What the frell do Libertarians have to do with anything? I'd love more discussion about how things will fall apart and what we can do in each scenario. But please remember that Collapse can come in many different shapes and sizes. It may be minor, say the economy falls apart and goods and service prices shoot up. It could be major like Apophis bursts out of nowhere and slams into France or a volcano erupts and suddenly mini ice age. And if you disagree with somebody's interpretation of things make sure to give a reason.

That being said, Keep up the good work!

The two of us are currently doing a wide variety of preparation. We still haven't really come clean to my parents why we're building a huge garden, getting animals, saving food, practicing firearm skills, staying in great shape, and so on. They just think we love to do all those things, which is true, but the truth is I'm also trying to prepare for a post-collapse scenario or for when life just gets much harder. With all that said, it can be difficult to prepare on a property that technically isn't ours and not be really clear on what our motivations are. Basically, my approach is to establish everything ""behind the scenes"" so to speak, so that when the time comes, we can simply move everything into place and switch to our new mode of operation as needed.

One of the biggest challenges with this is thinking about fortifying our home and some other work structures here on the property. The house in particular has a lot of very large windows and glass doors. It is all one-story, and anybody could easily walk up to windows at every room in the house and break them if they wanted to get in and steal things or hurt us. 

There are a couple of tactical advantages to the land at least, which is that it's fairly rural, and also we are up on top of a hill, looking out onto all the land around us and the two roads below. So at least during the day, we'd see people coming from at least a couple of miles away in any direction and have the upper-hand in defending ourselves. 

My worry with the house is that in order to fully secure it, we would need to make (major?) structural changes, which can't be done beforehand, given my parents are the owners. What are some things we could prepare now that we could put into place later on when needed? I'm thinking along the lines of covering windows and doors, maybe reinforcing one room on all walls.. we  both have big families (I mean including multiple generations) and some friends who may join us if they were willing and able when SHTF. So ideally we could secure at least a big enough area to support 30-40 people.

Whatever the case, my point is that I see the probability of warm socks, a good knife, a gallon of water, a mutlitool and a shovel being more useful than well.. whatever some people have the fantasy of being useful instead, no offense.

 So with that being said here is my list, and I would very much appreciate a set of ideas form more experienced people as to what to use my money on, I will write the list I have so far here:

A mutlitool
A long lasting flashlight and a bigger one
Lots of batteries (but a realistic amount with my budget)
A good knife, one that can be used for everyday use as well as a weapon maybe (give suggestions for a good one if you have any)
Different kind of rationed food
Sugar, wheat rice, beans and salt (hopefully 15-20 lb of each)
Fuel (don't know how much is enough)

Also I would love to have a gun but I am afraid I live in a socialist country, that cardles the citizens, and you need to go to shooting training for 2 years before you can even acquire a gun. While this does have it's benefits for all the various reasons, it is a bit of a bitch. So a gun is out of question, as I somehow get the feeling that should something happen it will happen before 2 years. 
Besides I feel I can use that time on something more important.

I do MMA frequently, and I also read as much as I can which isn't much for the time being. I also have an extensive library however it's located in my computer. 

Which reminds the last item of my ongoing list: A good solid solar charger. I have looked into this, and there don't seem to be many. 

PS: If this subject has been taken up before recently I am sorry to waste your time, just give me a link and I will look there instead. 

Thank you in advance

I just don't think any regular house will be good enough when the hungry mob comes around raiding everything in sight.

However, I don't want to have a basement built, or something even fancier, like a shelter, since anyone who helps me build it will know where to raid ISHTF.

Whatever I have built must look non-appealing, uninviting, and even useless for survival for anyone else involved in its construction. So I was thinking of starting by having a cesspit built, it seems like a pretty common construction request and the people you paid to build it will not tend to remember it as a potential shelter since they'll imagine it filled with human waste. I want the lid/hatch to be clearly marked with biohazard or toxic signs and ""CESSPIT"" lettering across it. The rest of the interior equipment fitting in it I can do myself as to not raise suspicions

**What do you think? Is that a good start?**

This next part is a bit fancier, but let's run with our imagination just for fun: I could even have a dual chambered cesspit built, one small access room having the entry hatch and the other larger room hidden and only accessible through the first room, though that would already make the construction request a bit more unusual but I can always built a dividing wall myself later on if I don't want that step performed by strangers. The idea is to turn the first accessible room into a true stink pit, with some biowaste (fecal matter, rotting carcasses one may find exploring, etc) dumped regularly into it for a real foul smell. This way, anyone who'd find and open the hatch would be further turned off by the nauseous smell and go away. You'd have to endure the stink yourself to enter/leave your safe room, but hey, this is survival we're talking about, it's not going to be easy anyways.

* Effective at least 300 yards out (I know this isn't asking much). More is always better for those of us who know our way around a rifle. Max effective point range might be the best metric here, since we can't assume everybody is king of the range.
* Relatively inexpensive. We need a choice that an everyman could stock up on. I don't know about anybody else, but I would mind paying a buck a round when I feel that I need a couple thousand of them.

Can anybody direct me to a discussion about the problem of rebuilding an ethical society after things fall apart? There seems to be plenty of discussion about individual survival strategies -- logistical plans -- but not much that I've come across concerning community-level re-organization, which seems equally important.

The problem I foresee is twofold: getting people to cooperate post-collapse, and -- on a larger scale -- getting society to develop in a truly sustainable direction. I know a lot of people might be resigned to letting the chips fall where they may, but it seems like a great deal of pain could be avoided post-collapse if there were some framework already in place for how society should function. 

What are the best principles for re-organizing society? How do you get people with different worldviews to cooperate in conditions of scarcity -- without resorting to violence?

Basically -- how do we make anarchism work?

Edit: I think the use of the term ""anarchism"" was unclear. This is not advocating for anarchism. What ""anarchism"" refers to is this: collapse usually means circumstances of sustained scarcity. In circumstances of sustained scarcity, traditional structures of government lose legitimacy. Political uprisings, like food riots, become more frequent; the longer the scarcity lasts for, the more this is true. So in a hypothetical collapse scenario, while politicians will still be ""in office,"" they'll be dealing with an increasingly desperate and unruly population. Odds are a group of people will eventually come along and say ""That guy? I didn't vote for that guy. Neither did my friends. He's the one who got us into this mess. But we've got a better plan -- and, also, guns."" Maybe this isn't as much of a problem in the rest of the industrialized world. But it's pretty likely here in the States, home of divisive politics and private arsenals. That is *de facto* anarchism: the only way to enforce political will is through violence or cooperation, and while it'd be nice to think people would always choose cooperation over violence, many people would probably need convincing, particularly when they're scared and hungry.",,False,self,t5_2sfb4,1352696886.0,,,True,t3_130qd4,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/130qd4/ethos_for_postcollapse_society/,

I was 13 years old at the time, so I have a different perspective looking back on it... I didn't even realize it's the exact kind of situation that we talk about until just the other day. For me, it was just a part of my childhood and growing up.

Background: I was in 8th grade when Hurricane Hugo hit the island of St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands (September 1989). Those of you who were alive and aware at that time likely remember reports of the destruction in Charleston, SC; by that time, the Caribbean islands were largely forgotten.

The Washington Post has a very detailed write-up about the situation in St. Croix in October 1989 that is worth a read if you want to hear what really happens when a society and infrastructure is almost wiped out: [Link](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/hurricane/archives/hugo89a.htm)

I remained on the island for about a month after the storm, before regular airline service was restored and I was sent to stay with my Grandmother. It was several months before regular power, telephone, and utilities were restored to the island and, even to this day, people still talk about it.

If anyone has questions about my experience -- the storm, life immediately after, lessons learned, that kind of thing -- I'm happy to answer as best as my memory over the years will allow me. I'm not intending to do this in real-time, but I will check in frequently and answer questions as I am able. Full disclosure: this is not my ""normal"" Reddit ID, I set this one up so I can be as detailed as possible without getting linked to my other online persona.

So... anything you want to know?",,False,self,t5_2sfb4,False,,,True,t3_vysfx,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/vysfx/as_a_kid_i_survived_a_massively_devastating/,

Something that shows what to look for in certain terrains but also how to actually concoct recipes such as gun powder, thermite, etc. Basically look at it as something like a survival guide mixed with a chemistry book, as well as information on for instance how to harvest crops to make bread, etc. 

I'm sure some of you here have your own survival kit already prepped and ready at a moments notice. But wouldn't it be ideal to also have one book to be the end all be all reference should you ever get in a jam and need to replenish stock, or create your own?

If there isn't one out there I was thinking about actually starting research on possibly creating one and then seeing if I can find some way of either publishing it in limited quantity (based on demand) or posting it online for free and giving info for a printing company that will print it for a reasonable price.

I am a novice looking to purchase a solar panel from amazon for an emergency generator. Can someone with experience with this kind of device please shed a little light on the process of a solar generator setup?

1) [Solar Panel.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OZJ4FY/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=AU5MW0P13QZ5V)Is this a decent output?

2)[Charge Controller.](http://www.amazon.com/Sunforce-60031-Digital-Charge-Controller/dp/B001DZONCW/ref=pd_vtp_lg_3)What kind of controller is appropriate?

3)12v battery (or more, for extra juice). Any kind?

4) Inverter for 120v hookup 

I'd like some insight into how these devices hook up to each other.  My biggest concern is how to properly charge the battery. I read that they can be dangerous and I really have no idea how to know when I am not using it properly. I see some places say draining the battery completely is bad. Other places say over charging is dangerous (hence the controller).

This is all so overwhelming, but I REALLY want to have a solar generator. I have a little money set aside for this setup and if anyone has some information or websites to check out, I'd be much obliged.

Yep, that's right. An EMP attack. This shit is scary to even think about.

An EMP event would mean no more fuel.  No food.  No modern transporation of any commodity in any bulk quantities.  No modern farming, no hauling grain to market.  No trains.  No fuel pumps, no service stations, no lights.  No pressurized water.  No fuel delivery.  No modern medicine, nothig would be left of moden society wich hangs by a single thread from total destruction.  An average city has about 3-5 days worth of supplies on hand.  Remember Katrina?

Millions would die in the riots, uprisings, fires and violence,

You will have a difficult time adjusting at first, but i suspect the following:

**When society has actually collapsed, you will receive more quality entertainment than you currently do**

**Video games:**

Video games will not exist. Instead you will play Role Playing Games like Dungeons and Dragons after all, the rule books still exist, people have printed them out, it's not going to be lost. Try it out some time, get a group of people together. If you have no friends, look on-line if people in your city need anyone to play with them, and join them and make nerd-friends.

Board games of complex and less complex varieties exist that function perfectly as replacement for many turn based strategy games.

**Books**

Books are around and will stay around. But here's the interesting thing:

When popular writers are no longer widely available, people will actually be willing to read whatever drivel **YOU** put out!

**Music**

But how will we do without Lady Gaga? You will adjust. Music can be made perfectly without electric instruments. You don't need computers, you don't even need electric guitars.

I'd like you to meet: 

**NeoFolk music:**

Wardruna - Laukr:

Tenhi - Kuolleesi Jokeen:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf3ILEAd1Mk

Forseti - Der graue König:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxE4JERwXSY

Are the above three too bleak? Try the following:

Dornenreich - Freitanz:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKZthOsdHNE

The entire song consists of three instruments, none electric. 

Think about this for a moment:

When recorded music comes to an end and your favorite band can't travel the continent anymore, people will actually be willing to listen to YOU!

**Martial music**

Gaë Bolg and the Church of Fand - Gloria:

[This section will be improved, feel free to leave some in the comment section. I'm not American, I'm European so this is not my expertise. Sorry!]

Do I hate electronic music? 

No! I actually listen to electronic music myself. My point is the following: Music will persist, and it will actually get better, because it will be live, and it will be different.

Electronic music is music for a certain environment, and a certain atmosphere. In a world in which we do not use electronic devices and do not like in a synthetic environment, we will not have such a desire for synthetic music.

Haha no not quite. But [this guy](http://www.reddit.com/user/selco), did an [IAmA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vitie/iama_balkan_war_survivor_lived_in_a_city/) about 4 month ago but sadly he deleted a good chunk of it after a while. But fear not because I've managed to resurrect (most) of it in its original glory.

[](/a07 ""Now gather round and I will tell you a story."")
Now here's a bit of context. Four month ago a guy named [Selco](http://www.reddit.com/user/selco) made an [IAmA post](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vitie/iama_balkan_war_survivor_lived_in_a_city/) about living in the [Balkans](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Balkan_topo_en.jpg) during [a war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_wars). There was more or less a complete breakdown of society and order with looting and other very unpleasant things happening. In short, it was bad. Like the kind of thing most people here prepare for kind of bad.  But the dude and many others made it through and now he's trying to share his knowledge and promote his website [SHTF School](http://shtfschool.com/). 

A little while later he deletes the post. I assume it's to drive traffic to his website. On his site, he offers courses in surviving a collapse. If you sign up for his free newsletter, you'll receive access to podcasts, articles, interviews and insight into what happens when the shit hits the fan. You'll also receive his Survival Guide ([Scribd](http://www.scribd.com/doc/110974061),[MF](http://www.mediafire.com/view/?w634f4wbxuaybbi),[DB](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3239462/For%20when%20mediafires%20a%20bitch/Selco%27s%20Survival.pdf])) which appears to contain the same information as in the AMA but in a nicer, easier to read format. You'll also receive his newsletters on delightful topics such as Visitng abandoned house, Interview about weapons during SHTF, Interview about typical gun fights and Urban Survival and Violence. Now I haven't actually read these but I haven't noticed any increase in spam and they seem all seem to read as advertised. 

Now there is a payed version of these courses, but as a broke college student I can only guess as to what it contains. 


[](/rb26 ""Haters gonna hate."") Sadly there is a [bit of debate](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/vj8as/ama_by_guy_who_actually_lived_it/c54zrgs) over whether or not this guy is telling the truth. Really it just seems to be that one guy, and he doesn't offer much other than his English is off and his responses seem a little canned. I'll leave it up to you guys to decided.

Here is [Narhwal bot's record of his responses](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vitie/iama_balkan_war_survivor_lived_in_a_city/c54x65z) along with the opening post of the IAmA.





&gt;from http://www.reddit.com/tb/vj36r

&gt;OK, i wanna share with you my own experience. (be patient with my English please) Some readers of my blog have suggested to do a IAmA here.

&gt;I am from Balkan region, and as some of you may know it was hell here from 92-95, anyway, for 1 whole year i lived and survived in a city of 50 000- 60 000 residents WITHOUT: electricity, fuel,running water,real food distribution, or distribution of any goods, or any kind of organized law or government.

&gt;The city was surrounded for 1 year and in that city actually it was SHTF (shit hit the fan) situation.

&gt;We did not have organized army or police force, there was groups of defenders, actually anybody who had a gun, fight for his own house and his own family.

&gt;Some of us was better prepared, but most of families had food for couple of days, some of us had pistol, few owned AK-47 when all started.

&gt;Anyway, after one month or two, gangs started with their nasty job,hospital looked like butchery, police force vanished, 80 percent of hospital staff gone home.

&gt;I was lucky, my family was big in that time (15 members in one big house, 5-6 pistols, 3 Kalashnikov s) so we lived and survived, most of us.

&gt;I remember US Air force dropped MRE every 10 days (god bless USA for that) as help for surrounded city, it just was not enough. Some of houses had little gardens with some vegetables, most did not.

&gt;After three months rumors started about first deaths from starvation,deaths from low temperatures, we stripped every door , window frame from abandoned houses for heating, i burned all my own furniture for heating, lot of people died from diseases, mostly from bad water (two of my family members), we used rain water for drink, several times i ate pigeons, once i ate rat.

&gt;Money was not worth shit. We traded things, few examples: for 1 corned beef can you could have woman for couple of hours (sounds bad, but it was reality) i remember, most of that women were just desperate mothers, candles, lighters,antibiotics,fuel,batteries, rifle ammo and of course food, we fight like animals for that.

&gt;In situation like that lot of things change, most of people turned to monsters, it was ugly.

&gt;Strength was in the numbers, if you were alone in the house, you ve been probably robbed and killed, no matter how well armed.

&gt;Anyway, war ended, again thanks to America (and again god bless USA for that). It is not important witch side had right in that war.

&gt;It was almost 20 years ago when I was a young man, but believe me, for me it was just like yesterday, i remember everything, and i think i learned a lot.

&gt;Me and my family are prepared now, i am well armed, stocked and educated. You might also want to start thinking about preparedness even if you live in a safer country.

&gt;My English is not that good and I will not say what city it was because i still live there (and there is still a lot of bad blood around) but you can ask me anything and i will answer as good as i can.

**Short Description:**

The world has changed after an economic collapse. A wave of riots, food and gas shortages, and hyperinflation have fundamentally altered the American way of life.

A college student is found dead on Route 16, shot and killed near his car. A small-town detective investigates the murder, but as he learns more, he realizes that he has stumbled onto just one piece of a much larger plan.

**Actual Description:**

This novella was written out of a personal interest to imagine a realistic future economic collapse and political unrest. I modeled this scenario after several economic and societal collapses in modern history. To model urban decay, I researched cities such as Baltimore, Detroit, and Johannesburg. To model government responses to economic crises, I used Argentina, the currently developing Eurozone crisis, and the United States in WWII and the OPEC embargo. The response of individuals and societies to economic change was harder to create. I assembled stories from Hurricane Katrina, from the Bosnian War, the Iraq War, and Northern Ireland during “The Troubles”.

This novella borrows heavily from the literary style of Michael Crichton. The limited third-person narrative, and the use of a detective as a vehicle to explore a constructed universe was directly inspired from his novel Rising Sun. Other influences include Frank Herbert’s Dune, particularly in the political intrigue and verbal duels, and the TV show The Wire, for its penetrating look into the logic of institutional dysfunction.

Any realistic scenario of economic or social upheaval must involve political action. Although the plot involves politics, I hope you will not find the plot overly political. It is not meant as a political diatribe. In writing this, I found it difficult to construct a realistic total collapse scenario. The common decency of ordinary Americans prevents most apocalypse scenarios.

While there has been a recent boom in post-apocalyptic, civilizational collapse, natural disaster, and zombie fiction, I believe this novella occupies a unique niche in this space. I hope you will find it worthy of your time and attention.

**Here's why I'm posting it on Reddit:**

1. There's no gimmicks, no marketing, it's just a free book.

2. I think it's a pretty entertaining read. I'm not just saying that because I wrote it.

3. I'm not a professional writer. I think it's pretty good, and better than most survival fiction out there, including ones you are supposed to pay money to read. But I'd like to get some opinions from people who don't know me.

4. I'd like to get some expert opinions. I've done a lot of research, but if you live in South Dakota, or thereabouts, feel free to tell me I've got things totally wrong. If you're a cop, let me know if I've got things wrong.

5. Need fresh eyes. When you write your own story, it's hard to keep track of what you know, versus what the reader is supposed to know at that point. So...help me find the logical problems, the plot holes.

6. Editing. There's always going to be some stuff that missed the proofread. I'm not too worried about that right now, but feel free to point out where I need editing.

7. Gauge interest. This is a 70-page, 15000-word read. If people really like it, I'm going to go for the real thing, a 300-page 75000-word novel. But I want to hash out the universe and writing style first.

8. More ideas. Maybe I've got some big concepts wrong. Think the government will confiscate guns post-collapse? Lay out the case for it. If I'm convinced, I'm convinced!

**About me:**

I been reading survivalist stuff since I was six, starting with My Side of the Mountain. Then I started reading - researching really - more about civil wars, societal collapse, revolutions, mostly from a historical perspective. Have always been interested in putting together a take on what a US collapse might look like, and I finally did it.

As a redditor, I've been lurking r/starcraft for a long time. Yeah, I'm one of those people. It wasn't until after I finished writing this that I realized reddit would be a great place to get some feedback. So here I am.

Right there. Its not about nuclear war or meteor strike or bloody zombies, it's about social collapse after some very possible troubles. We may not be facing quite the energy crisis they feared but it was 1979 and, in fact, it and the genre inspired a sudden panic and research into other ways of producing energy which means we have a bit less to worry about. I very much doubt without it's shocking possibilities whether the people and governments of the world would have thought much about it. 

The post-apocalyptic landscape is, in fact, Australia. If it had been filmed a little north it would have seen Hobbiton looking an awful lot different. 

I think it does a very good job of showing how a small rural area deals with social collapse. It does not show the center of New York. For that you want HARDWARE :)

Since gasoline generators are pretty impractical and won't be useful for very long anyway once fuel becomes scarce, human-powered equipment is the clear choice. What ideas do you have for personal electricity? 

&amp;nbsp;

I've looked into bicycle powered generators, portable solar packs, etc., but by themselves they each seem to have relatively low output. But what about pedal power in tandem with solar and maybe something else that I haven't thought of? 

&amp;nbsp;

I'd like to find or design and build a simple all-in-one device that is:

* 
reasonably portable

* able to hold a decent charge

* relatively lightweight and stealthy

* 
as durable and low-maintenance as possible

* 
constructed mostly from readily available parts

* 
multifunctional with multiple charge options (solar, hydro, pedal power, etc)

* 
able to produce enough power to charge a smartphone/laptop and a small appliance for at least an hour a day or at least a couple of times a week.

&amp;nbsp;

Ideally I envision something I could use while camping even now, like I use my nifty little crank/solar AM/FM/SW radio with built in LED light. Something easily mountable to a bike (one-size fits all preferably), which connects to a battery pack stored in a solar backpack. It'd be extra awesome to have the ability to unmount it from the bike and somehow adapt it for hydro power while you camp near waterfalls or rapids. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is clearly a tall order, but it should be possible to design something that meets at least a few of the above criteria.

Socks! We never throw them out. If they get a hole in them we cut them off at the hole and wear them on our elbows or on our knees when it is cold out and we are wearing long clothing anyways. No one can see them and they are really really warm. I often cut a hole for my thumb and wear them as arm socks and pull gloves over them. They are great for sealing that gap between gloves and a coat sleeve. I have a few that I cut lengthwise and wear as a scarf/facemask. It's very breathable and warm.

I recently discovered that instead of buying undershirts to keep my core warm I can cut the sleeves off of my wifes worn out shirts and sweaters. I am 6'6"" and my wife is 5'5"" so her tiny shirts fit nice and snug under the rest of my clothes if I cut the sleeves off. My Turtleneck under-sweater is one of my new favorite clothing articles.

My next forge will be made of mud and shaped in a way that it sucks a bunch of air in mechanically, but that's not what I am posting about. 

I dug up a collection of links from youtube about how to make the varying things one might need to create knives and tools cheap and easy.

Make Charcoal:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpDSbHZk

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0HW4qk8dv4

The essence of making charcoal is burning organic matter in a low/no oxygen environment.

Homemade Forge:

[Posting a youtube search results page](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=homemade+forge&amp;oq=homemade+forge&amp;gs_l=youtube.3..0l8j0i5l2.2986.6505.0.7383.14.9.0.4.4.0.144.976.2j7.9.0...0.0...1ac.Mtnv8Gyp9hE) because there wasn't a lot of crap videos to sort through. The results seem to cover the variety of decent ways.

The basics of a forge are blasting air into burning charcoal in order to heat metal.

When I made my knife I used a weber grill for the step of softening the steel. I put in charcoal, BUT piled wood on top of it with the files in the charcoal. The woodfire sucked air through the bottom thus blasting the charcoal hot enough to melt my weber grill (free on CL.)

File Knife How-To Vids:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7r_2KUBP08

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjO2IyT6G20

The breakdown of how to make a file into a knife with the stock removal method is:

* Heat the file till it is non-magnetic or just heat the ever-loving shit out of it.

* Let it cool slowly. 

* The metal should be soft now, scratch a tiny portion of it with an untreated file to make sure. 

* Cut the shape you want with a hack saw or whatever. Grind or file the grind and the edge. 

* Now heat it up until a magnet won't stick to it and quench it straight down, tip first, quickly into oil. Repeat this step a few times. I'm no expert, but I did three.

* Sharpen, polish, etc. go cut stuff with it.

My first attempt at this produced an ugly as sin knife. But it holds an edge and can shave arm hair or carve wood. I used a bastard file so the handle was already there. Then for simplicity's sake I just cut a diagonal line across the steel, and *poof* tanto tip. 

Fun stuff, everyone should do this at least once.

There could be an atomic attack and they would just look up from working in the fields and see a mushroom cloud and think, ""Holy shit!"" Maybe they are a little too rustic for you, but my point is, unplug from society to the extent you can or to the extent you feel comfortable. Let the politicians and governments and oil companies do as they will--HINT: They're going to anyway! Expect hard work- as a society, in the U.S. anyway, we learn to buy ready-made stuff, be good consumers and buy, buy, buy! It's liberating to not be a slave to the dollar and the consumer-driven way of life it creates. Save what you waste on STUFF and get 5 acres somewhere away from major cities. 10 if you can afford it. If you're "" on-the-grid"" at first, study ways you can harness solar energy-- so far anyway, the powers that be haven't figured a way to charge us for FREE SUNSHINE. Plant some simple crops. You may have to go into town to supplement your needs for awhile. If you do, try to find a local CO-OP instead of some over-charging supermarket with inferior products. There IS life after Con-Agra! Get tips from ""simple living"" books and magazines and websites. Collect ideas in a journal or notebooks. Jot down notes from books at bookstores--don't BUY the books! The further you distance yourself from the consumer-driven society, things that used to be ultra important to you will become less and less so. I'm talking about TV watching and surfing the web. If you make a weekly trip to town for goods, stop by the public library and use THEIR free internet service, or carry your laptop or tablet along and go somewhere for coffee and use THEIR FREE Wi Fi! While you're on the computer for free, go to Craigslist or a similar site and look under FREE STUFF and BARTERING. You'll be amazed at the things a consumer-driven society consider JUNK! Interact with like-minded people for more ideas. Start small. Don't expect to own a self-sufficient, bustling homestead on day one. 
My point is, the simpler, the better. If you adopt this lifestyle, Post Collapse or not, you won't be caught with your pants down on the day the evil ones pull the plug or push the button or whatever they have planned. You won't be found scrambling for food in a supermarket chain that will, being the opportunists they are, raise prices and run out of goods. You won't be a slave to the electric company and all of the nice things being able to flip a switch brings us. I think more and more Americans and others will begin to get off of the path we've followed for so long---the path of bundled cable TV/Internet packages, the path of Working Class masses paying tax on top of tax to enjoy membership in a society of consumer amoebas. There are tons of FREE stuff strewn all over the countryside in the U.S. Learn to use what you have wisely. Put some money back and read up on repairing equipment, sewing, cooking, tending your land, etc.
I'm not there yet. I have a lot of ideas-some are more easy to attain than others. I realize there will be roadblocks. But I won't be a slave to changing political ideals and live in fear of COLLAPSE much longer.

has fallen apart.

A month passes. Maybe two.

The initial survivalism that you've learned has kicked into high gear; the
initial dispersion has worn off, and small pockets of society have begun to
reconvene. Not the overextended sprawls that used to define our cities, but
small towns, groups and homesteads that have banded together -- strength in
numbers.

As society regroups, what does the economy look like? My opinion is that it
would be large trade-based, rather than currency - trading ammunition for food,
for example. In this realm, what skilled trades are most valuable? Easiest to
learn? I'd like to be able to develop valuable skills for a postcollapse world,
should I need them.

Here's the list I've been thinking about so far (in no particular order). What
are additions to this list? Resources for learning the trade?

- Blacksmith (knives, axes, etc.)

- Weaponsmith (repairing firearms)

- Leatherwork (tanning, leather goods)

- Mechanic

- Electrician, particularly solar power repair(?)

- Gardener/Farmer

- Trapper

- Hunter

- Beer brewer/alcohol distiller

would be valuable to society post-collapse?

I give a scenario based on events that are happening right now and your task is to explain, using the S.T.O.P (Situation, Threats, Observations, plan) method, what you would do. The trick is you have to start out where ever you are now with what ever you have on you. Post pics with discriptions of where you are the moment you read this and also pics of your inventory. After the conclusion of your response follow it up with th motto In Omnia Paratus.

Scenario: There has just been a large storm cell with winds up to 90 mph. The power grid in your area has been compromised and flash floods are ravaging large portions of the surrounding area. As a result of the wind there are trees down blocking some roads and debris. What do you do?

Good luck.

1343323749.0,19,self.PostCollapse,x76j5,"Can Someone Explain Calculating PV, Inverters, and Deep Cell Batteries?",Expressman,22,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/x76j5/can_someone_explain_calculating_pv_inverters_and/,"I'm simply trying to understand the needs of any given appliance, and how that would relate to energy collection (wind or PV), storage, and conversion. Please excuse my ignorance. I've been reading several articles but none of them really lay out the basics. So we have some Algebra 1 to do here.

For example lets take this [700w Microwave](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202868488/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;keyword=Microwave&amp;storeId=10051&amp;superSkuId=203153360#specifications).

I understand 700w is a lot of juice, but also microwaves in my house usually only run 30-seconds to 2 minutes.

So if you have a 2000w/5000w inverter, and I don't know where to start on the battery bank... I assume the inverter is wired to a household fuse box so the microwave is on a 15+ amp breaker.

What is the consumption? What would be the formula?

Or what if I had four 17w LED lightbulbs? That's 68wh right? So a 130w solar panel would store time and a half for it at peak conditions, or fall behind to about 39wh on a cloud-covered day.

Regarding deep cycle batteries... are most inverters only designed for 12v batteries? Is there an advantage in a household context to going up to 24v? And I'm not sure how to interpret battery specs [like these](http://www.zappworks.com/battery_specs.htm).

So going with their [250 Model](http://www.zappworks.com/battery_prices.htm), it says 12v, 3kWH. So at capacity this battery will output up to 3000w at 12v (15amp) for three hours? Does that translate straight down to like 1000w for 9 hours? 500w for 18?

Adding batteries in series, this just increases capacity but the voltage remains what the battery is made for (12, 24, 48) if I understand it. And more batteries mean less discharge and more cycle life?

So if one had six of those batteries they would have 18kWH?

So, charging those bad boys. I know you should have a charge controller, and lets say for argument you have two of [these fine 390w monocrystaline panels](http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=solar+panels&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=UxS&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;prmd=imvnsr&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=784&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=8146846093883201126&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TXwRUNbSNY6k8gTzuoGIDw&amp;ved=0CIsBEPMCMAI).

So ideally they are putting out a combined 780w. We take away 20% of that for the inefficiency of the NiCd batteries, leaving 624w. If each battery is 3kw, assuming the charge can take that quickly, you can fill a battery in 4.8 hours. If half the light, double the hours (9.6).

Am I right? I understand I haven't factored in phantom voltage yet.

I would love to figure all this out.

***Compatibility***: This is the strongest advantage Glock pistols have against others, due to the company's popularity.
It can be converted to:

9mm

.357SIG

.22LR(with a special upper)

Parts are extremely common, and 9mm, .40S&amp;W, and .357SIG all can use the same magazine.

***Reliability/Durability***: Of course, Glock pistols have a legendary record of reliability, and the polymer frame is almost indestructible.

***Ergonomics***: This is where the Glock fares worst. For most shooters, the angle of the grip is too steep and makes it very uncomfortable to shoot. An M&amp;P or a CZ75 would fare much better in this category.

It's not as silly as it sounds, obviously I need warm clothes but do I need them in a bug out bag? they do take up a lot of room and add weight to the bag.

A little background:

 - I live in a city.

 - I keep the bag in the boot of my car at all times.

 - I work in the CBD.

 - I live in a place where death by exposure to extreme heat or cold is not a realistic consideration.

 - I work on the assumption that I will *not* be able to drive my car back to my home, or to one of the fall back locations I have. I assume I'll need to walk.

When I put those factors together and balance them out I start thinking ""chances are I'll either be at home, in the CBD or at the home of a friend/family member and having hiking boots and clothes probably isn't that big a deal"" and I come to the conclusion that one set of clothes and boots really isn't worth the room and weight which could be given over to food or simply making the bag smaller and lighter.

1311786577.0,20,self.PostCollapse,j1b20,Hunting vs. farming for protein?,nonself,21,1,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/j1b20/hunting_vs_farming_for_protein/,"I see a lot of posts on here about hunting in a post-collapse society.  But I wonder, is hunting a good long term survival strategy?  How much wild game is available in your area?  How many people can a community of hunters support?

As an alternative (and because I'm not much of a hunter myself), I've been looking into growing soybeans.  Like meat, soy is a ""complete"" protein, meaning it contains all the essential amino acids your body needs.  The soybean also has one of the highest percentages of protein by weight of any vegetable - [around 35%](http://www.uwex.edu/ces/crops/SoyProtein.htm)

Using conservative estimates for my area, I figure I could produce about 20 bushels from [one acre of soybeans](http://www.agricommodityprices.com/futures_prices.php?id=392)

Each bushel weighs [60 pounds](http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G4020)  So that's 1200 pounds of beans, and 420 pounds of raw protein.

For comparison, deer meat is [26% protein](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/lamb-veal-and-game-products/4813/2) (24.6g/93g patty) 

A mature buck yields [72 pounds of meat](http://www.butcher-packer.com/index.php?main_page=document_general_info&amp;cPath=36&amp;products_id=331)

So, about 19 pounds of protein per deer, and 23 deer killed to get the same amount of protein as my acre of soybeans.

The CDC says adult men can get by on [56 grams of protein per day](http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/protein.html), while bodybuilders might consume [over 160 grams](http://www.smart-strength-training.com/protein-per-day.html) We want members of our community to be strong and able to defend themselves, so I'm going to go with 100 g per day. So 36500 g per year / 453.6 g per pound = 80.5 pounds of protein per person per year.  Which means my hypothetical field can support 5 healthy adults, or you can round that up to one extended family ~ 2 parents, a grandparent or two, and a couple of kids.

So hunters, I'd like to know:

* How far would you have to roam to take in 23 deer per year?

* What impact would this have on the deer population in that area?

* How much ammo would be required?  (Average number of missed shots / number of shots to kill?)

* Are small game (squirrels / birds) more realistic as a food supply?  I haven't run the numbers on them yet...",,False,self,t5_2sfb4,True,,,True,t3_j1b20,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostCollapse/comments/j1b20/hunting_vs_farming_for_protein/,

One idea that someone brought up months ago in an unrelated discussion at /r/finance was honey.

Honey has many practical applications in a post-collapse world such as antiseptic ointment for cuts and the obvious caloric content. Another thing it's got going for it is that it can be preserved indefinitely (more or less) provided it is kept in a cool space like an underground cellar or cave.

It's also relatively cheap to stock up on currently so it's feasible to stash your own ""honey pots"" in preparation.
