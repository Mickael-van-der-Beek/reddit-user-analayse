It got good feedback last time, so let's see what you guys think.

So my idea was that, when you crouch, your height is 1.5m or less, that way you can fit under certain obstacles. I'll get to that in a second. Since the character is roughly 1.7-1.8 meters tall, a 20-30cm difference seems logical.

[Here](http://imgur.com/1Z7HV) is a visual example for 2m and 1.5m ceilings.

About fitting under obstacles, say you have a 2 block high ceiling, and you put a slab on the ceiling. Slabs are 0.5m thick. So, when you try to walk under it, you can't as the distance from the floor to the bottom of the slab in 1.5m. Now how about, when crouching, fitting underneath of that slab was possible. Eh? A decent example for that, so it isn't completely useless, is if you have a mineshaft. Those are usually 2 blocks high. If you put a half slab on the floor or ceiling of each individual shaft, you can crouch and get through it, however, other mobs can't. This would be a good way to prevent mobs from sneaking up from inside your other shafts.

[Here](http://imgur.com/dwVxg) is an example of the mine shaft.

Sorry if this explanation was a little rambly, or some parts are irrelevant. I'm not sure how to adequately explain what I'm getting at. I will upload some pictures shortly, so you can have a visual.

I like the idea of rarer items or mobs, or ones that only are available at certain times, and seasons are one way to have this. It also adds some variance to areas that you'd normally otherwise see in new biomes.


Spring

* Grass with a certain light level has a small chance of randomly spawning a flower, and certain flowers are only available during spring.

* Higher chance of rain


Summer

* Lower chance of rain

* Lower chance of snow in taiga and tundra biomes

* All villagers wear sunglasses


Autumn

* Leaves on trees change to autumn (orange, red, yellow, brown, etc) colors and can be collected as blocks of those

* Piles of leaves can spawn under trees, and could stack up in piles like snow. These could be collected and crafted into leaf blocks like you'd get from a tree.


Winter

* Chance of snow in any biome during winter

* Small lakes have a chance of freezing

* Slightly higher chance to spawn wolves, and/or small chance of wolves spawning outside of their natural biome, if it's snowing.


Additionally, having birds in the game would give it some extra ambient flavor, and as we know, birds migrate. So, spawn rates could be normal in the spring and autumn, low in winter, and high in summer.

Biomes could be grouped into subsets by type, grouping together similar biomes into larger areas.

Biomes in the same subset would always generate together, in clusters. [Rough example](http://i.imgur.com/yvcZ72k.png). The addition of interesting sub-biomes would make exploration more interesting and rewarding, and by clustering them together with similar biomes, they would never look out of place.

2. Biome organisation

Even with similar biomes being clustered together, you would still encounter the problem of wildly different biomes generating next to each other (desert and taiga, etc.) To counter this, there should be rules about which biomes can generate next to each other.

Book. Copying.

The cloning recipe already exists for maps! [LOOK.](http://i.imgur.com/FcNxU6T.jpg) Why can't we have this for written books too?

I know this suggestion won't get much attention since this isn't a huge feature request. BUT, here are all the things that would be possible in vanilla SMP minecraft servers if players could have the ability to write books and then **easily make copies of their work.**

* Players could write stories and give copies to their friends and neighbors in-game!
* Libraries could be set up and run without the need for any new plugins! Libraries could keep backups of books in secure underground vaults.
* Towns could have rulebooks, guidebooks, constitutions, laws, and **HISTORIES**, permanently inscribed in books for future generations and newcomers!
* Players could write personal journals, biographies, and even **LETTERS TO OTHER PLAYERS.**
* Players who are more artistic and creative but not necessarily into building (believe me, these players exist) could have ways of expressing themselves and sharing their work with others.

The invention of the written word REVOLUTIONIZED human history. The addition of written books into Minecraft *should* have had the same impact, but without a way of easily copying books, each book is a delicate piece of artwork that must be safely kept in a chest at all times. It can't be shared due to the risk of it being stolen or destroyed or lost.

IMHO it is a serious obstacle to the potential of written books that there exists no way to easily copy them in Vanilla minecraft! Why did the developers do this much but leave out such a simple feature? Anyways, just wanted to share....

EDIT: More Ideas:

* Players could assemble their own private collections of books written by other players, and keep them at their homes.

They'd all work, but I have an idea that came to me in a dream a few days ago, and I like it better.

You put the egg in the furnace, and put fuel (lava bucket, stack of blaze rods, or the usual stuff) beneath it.  Every now and then you come back and add more fuel so that it doesn't stop cooking.  After about five minutes of cooking the egg, one of three things happens:

In the End:  The dragon is reborn.  The portal stays put, but you may want to go through it soon.

In the Nether:  Nothing happens.

In the regular world:  Thunder cracks and darkness is unleashed for a set time.  During this time:

The sky goes red (like in The End.)  Undead creatures spawn and don't burn in this light, and at night the stars and moon have a red tinge.

Light sources now give off 70% of their light.

Monsters spawn with increased frequency, and with enchanted armor and weapons.

Below sea level, dark places can spawn poison spiders as easily as any other mob.

All monsters have maximum level pathing, AI, and view distances.

Zombies and creepers can see (smell) through walls.

Creepers have a shortened 'fuse' and will explode if they are chasing you but are stopped by a wall and don't see a way around/through.

Spider jockeys spawn commonly.

The thunder and lightning are constant, but rain doesn't fall.

Zombies can punch through dirt, wood, leaves, and glass.

Mushroom biomes are no longer safe.

Wild wolves go aggro on sight.  They also spawn randomly.

Spiders and spider jockeys take no fall damage, and are much better at climbing.

Endermen don't spawn.

Portals don't work.  Beds don't work.

This effect lasts 30 minutes, during which the player endures the siege.  Then it ends, the dragon egg is intact and cool, and it's time to rebuild.

Reward?  Beats me.  Maybe lightning strikes and leaves behind a chest with some treasure.  Maybe you get one block of bedrock in the furnace 'out' slot.  Maybe nothing.

This would be faster than placing ladders and more realistic than placing water. The only disadvantage would be you can't climb back up the rope, it's one way only. My final reason for calling them ropes is that they could be used in crafting recipes. A great idea would be to craft a rope ladder. These would behave just like a regular ladder, except they would be able to be placed by themselves as opposed to needing to be placed on the side of a block.

* Creative mode flight and health system. Can fly and no health/armor/food/breathing bars are visible.

* Adventure mode Break/Place block system: that is, no placing/breaking blocks.
* Spectators cannot interact with entities: Entities cannot be hit, shot, pushed, etc. Entities also pass right though the player, without interference, including arrows, minecarts, etc.
* Spawners do not activate from a player in spectator mode.
* Redstone is not set off, spectators cannot set off buttons or levers, and cannot activate ppads or tripwire. Cannot open/close doors.
* Natural mob spawns are unaffected by spectators. Spectators can witness hostile mobs spawn and despawn a block away. Spectators do not influence the mob cap.
* The spectator cannot influence the GUI of chests/etc., but can access it: They can see what is in a chest/furnace but cannot change. With chests, a chest will not visibly/audibly open. Also possible to right click other players to see their inventory, hotbar, and possibly their health/food/breath/armor bars.
* Spectators mode inventory is Survival like, they do not have access to the creative menu. Perhaps no access to even edit their own inventory? Perhaps *no* inventory? 

***What this can be used for -***

1) PVP events, a spectator can observe the pvp event without possibly influencing the game in any way.

2) A server's default gamemode. Creative servers can have spectator mode be the default join in, to tour the server without breaking builds. A vanilla form of server protection.

3) Map makers, can use the mode to not set off their own traps prematurely, will not let spawners spawn mobs; a tool to help map making. Could also use it for a unique experience in a custom map as a player, if controlled right (Or perhaps as an after-completion gamemode..)

4) Hardcore worlds can be viewable in spectator mode after dying in it. Thanks [Muniosi](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/117irm/gamemode_3_spectator_mode/c6k1jiu)!

Heres how I imagine it working. It would only affect certain biomes and each biome may slightly differ depending on its climate. A season could last between 20-30 minecraft days as to allow a good period of time for any benefits to be exploited and changes to be appreciated.

Ill list the biomes and the changes ""I"" imagine they could have per season: 


These are the ""MAIN seasonal biomes"" I imagine and would dictate certain changes in other biomes less effected"" 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Plains-Forest-extreme hills-swampland:**


**Spring**- Animals naturally breed every so often
              wheat and trees and plants grow much quicker
              Flowers and long grass would naturally grow
              High chance for brief rain


**Summer**- Very rare chance of rain but when it does it usually is stormy
                  Crops grow at average speed.
                  Wheat crops drop extra
                  The day night cycle slightly shifts so there is a couple more minutes of day and fewer of night   (effecting all Biomes)


**Autumn**-  Tree leaves change colour to more of a red brown (excluding pine/spruce trees)
                 Oak trees occasionally drop apples naturally (like how chickens drop eggs)
                 Fruit crops drop more and higher chance of trees dropping saplings when their leafs are destroyed
                 long grass drop more seeds
                 Higher chance of rain and very rarely snow 


**Winter**- High chance of snow (settled snow would melt in the spring)
              bodies of still water would freeze over (also melt in spring)
              Leafs could change colour and texture to a brown and appear more stick like (excluding pine/spruce)
              animals are slightly harder to breed (take more wheat or something)
              slightly less fruit crop drops
              slightly less seeds from long grass
              Long grass and flowers have a chance to die off (excluding player placed)
              Day night cycle shift so there are a few more minutes of night and fewer of day (effecting all Biomes)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the main changes i imagine and they would mainly only effect these biomes. Other biomes would be effected differently as other biomes are more season specific.

heres how they could be effected slightly differently.


**Jungle**: Treated like spring through all seasons. More rain during winter period (no snow)


**Desert**: Treated like summer through all seasons besides the day night shift dictated by main seasonal biomes. More rain during spring period (Rainy season)

(**EDIT**: Thought dust storms could occur in the winter. Could be purely aesthetic but maybe also harm the player on higher difficulties.)


**Taiga**: During spring and summer it is treated as spring and during autumn and winter it is treated as winter.


**Ice Plains**: Treated as Winter all year round. Excluding the day night time shifts that would still be dictated by the main seasonal biomes.


**Mushroom**: Treated as autumn but has no chance of snow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Im sure I have missed some important seasonal changes that could be added so I'll edit this post if anyone points them out to me. This is just how I imagine seasons would be implemented. I realise what I've suggested wouldn't be a quick and easy addition but I strongly feel it would add both an enjoyable aesthetic change, to the world every so often, and benefits and drawbacks that would take careful planning to exploit and avoid. This, I feel, would add a new level of challenge. Also Seasonal effects could maybe be amplified in hard and hardcore difficulties so it becomes harder to survive in winters (etc).

Sorry for the length and complexity of my suggestion.


**[Short version]** Add seasons. These would effect certain biomes in different ways. Each season would add benefits/drawbacks. Aesthetic changes in certain biomes. Maybe make seasonal changes alter in magnitude depending on selected gameplay difficulty.

3 haybales across, a fence on the bottom, and a pumpkin on the top in a ""+"" formation. 

It is attracted to tilled land, but once it's on tilled land it won't move onto any other block. It will not trample farmland. It will not go off tilled soil unless agro.

Passives will avoid it, so will other scarecrows.

Hostiles will ignore it. 

It is the fastest creature in the game, but only when it's agro. It is otherwise the slowest.

If any creature or player gets to close it will agro on them, unless they're wearing a pumpkin and/or are invisible. If a pumpkin is worn it will it will think the player or a zombies is a plant.

It will not move when it senses players looking at it, unless it's already agro.

Scarecrows will ignore creepers, because they are plants. They will also ignore tectificates (their creators and providers).

It can not give damage, but gives a new debuff called ""fear"".

If it is agro it will chase the target briefly, knocking it back harmlessly away, while simultaneously giving the mentioned fear debuff. 

It makes rustling sounds, like dry leaves, when it moves.

It has 5 hearts.

The ability to dress up the scarecrow with a leather chest plate and a leather.

When killed, it has the chance to drop a carrot (5%), a potato (5%), a melon seed (5%), a pumpkin seed (5%) or just a seed (80%) with 3 to 5 wheat. 

If you give it one wheat it can heal half a heart.

They spawn in villages, protecting the farms from looters.

It will have a seldom bonemeal effect on random blocks in it's vicinity.

If you are doomed to die by a scarecrow the death message is ""______ wished he had a brain""

• One could be dropped by a spider-jocky, but only if the jocky is killed by a player riding a pig (or horse)

• One could given to the player when they beat the wither/end dragon

• One could simply be a 1 : 100,000 chance of dropping from dirt.

• One could be dropped only if you kill an enderman holding a jukebox.

• One could be the loot you get if you push a lime-green sheep off of a cliff

• One could be an enchanted version of another (or named to a certain thing on the anvil)

• One could be found only in a nether-fortress chest

• One could be found only in a stronghold library chest

Books? And what if you wanted to place a spawner in creative mode for something *other* than pigs? ...wouldn't it be nice if you could do all these things easily without *any* mods?

This thread is to discuss potential GUI updates that would benefit vanilla minecraft. Please feel free to suggest your own ideas or mock-ups.

**SIGNS:** [Mock-up illustration](http://i.imgur.com/6WF4Ivd.gif).

* It is now possible to click anywhere on the sign to edit text. No more having to delete entire lines to fix spelling errors!
* A ""finished"" sign may be edited after the fact as well by right clicking on it to bring the GUI back up. [Servers may need some sort of command to turn this ability on or off, as some obviously don't want visitors messing with their signs].

**BOOK AND QUILL:** (most of these functions are already built in, but just need an easy interface for users) [Mock-up illustration](http://i.imgur.com/svEMFGX.jpg) as seen in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/yc2c4/book_and_quill_upgrade_concept/).

* Click on a button to activate, click on it again to turn it off. (The ""?"" button you see in the concept screenshot is the ""random text"" feature seen [3] [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psNf1Nj-8wE&amp;t=0m33s)).

* Players can click anywhere in the book to make text changes (this includes selecting sections of text with the cursor to delete/apply italics/etc).

* There is a ""jump to page"" feature.

* Copy-pasting text works.

* You can sign as whatever author name you want (if this is problematic for some reason, only Mods/Admins/Single Player worlds can do so).

**PAINTINGS**: [Mock-up illustration.](http://i.imgur.com/inhoYa9.png) (or, alternately, separated into categories of ""small, medium, and large."")

* Place a painting and right click on it to bring up the GUI.
* If you are using a texture pack, the GUI images pull from the pack.
* Paintings ""expand"" like normal (bottom left to top right) but any painting too large to fit the area will not be toggleable.

**MOB SPAWNERS**: (creative mode only) [Mock-up illustration.](http://imgur.com/uwDI7vL)

* Place a spawner and right click on it to bring up the GUI where you can choose which mob spawns.
* Mobs could be sorted by category ""Passive/Nether/Tameable/etc."" or selected using the search feature.
* User [jwbjerk](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1dcqzs/gui_additions_and_updates/c9p7ybh) suggests that instead of a GUI, right clicking with an egg on the spawner could determine the mob. This would also be a good solution to the problem.

**NOTE BLOCKS**:

* Some sort of simple arrow GUI allowing the player to progress through notes forwards *and* backwards (so they don't have to go through the entire scale when they've missed the note they wanted). It could be as simple as clicking on the right side of the block or the left.
* A more complex (but useful) GUI idea was presented by user [WhinoTheRhino.](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1dcqzs/gui_additions_and_updates/c9pda1x) A GUI of either music staff or a keyboard would allow the player to click exactly on which note they want the note block to play.",,False,,t5_2s3oo,1367300695.0,,,True,t3_1dcqzs,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1dcqzs/gui_additions_and_updates/,

The nature in Minecraft is something that seriously needs updating, from the ocean content, to the world generation, to the transition biomes, to the biome specific ambiences.
 
**Terrain:** Minecraft has some pretty cool sights, but nothing outstanding. We need to take advantage of 256. I'm talking mountains that reach up past 200. We need variation, we need to move the floor to 90, and make ravines deeper, plus this enables more layers for ores. I could go on, but I'll leave you with [this](http://i.imgur.com/A5zbu.jpg).

**Ambience:** Minecraft could sound nicer. Crickets to chirp you asleep in swamps, cold windy nights in the tundra, and the rich ambience of the jungle.

**Biome Transitions:** This has been mentioned before; deserts next to tundras? Whaaa? We need transitional biomes. I'm talking desolate boreal forests that never snow, savannahs that connect forests and deserts.

**Oceans:** They are lacking. They should be dangerous in the colder parts with sharks that threaten your dives for resources, and friendly in warmer parts with tropical fish that follow you on your hunt for ocean-specific loot. Oceans are huge, so instead of saying ""ughhh a f*cking ocean,"" we should make it so you really say ""Tammy! Come check it out! I found a f#cking ocean!.""

**Biomes:** We need more of them, different trees, different grasses, and most of all, different biome-specific resources and buildings. Many extra biome mods have illustrated this point well. [Here](https://github.com/ExtrabiomesXL/ExtrabiomesXL/wiki/List-of-Biomes) is a few pictures from the XL Biomes mod, although some of the screenshts contradict my earlier suggestion for transitional biomes.

**Extras:** Biome specific villages that look *good* including underground lord-of-the-rings sequa mining villages, kingdoms, dungeons that aren't one room and have multiple corridors, biome specific mobs (not just ocean), also [fireflies](http://i.imgur.com/DxZcE.png), critters, and birds to make the world feel less lonely and desolate.

For example, if the game detects a large amount of stone and grass, the player is in Extreme Hills and above Y: 80, starts playing a strong wind effect. If the game detects a large percentage of flowing water around it could play a rushing water sound (the sound that currently plays sounds more a river lazily flowing than a huge torrent of water rushing downwards).

In forest biomes, when the player is around Y:60 and a lot of wood blocks are around, it could play bird sounds, and the sound of swaying trees. In swamps, around Y:60 and the game detects vines, wood, leaves and water lilies, it could play a sound of crickets and frogs at night, and the buzzing of mosquitoes during the day.

In snow biomes, it could play the sound of wolves howling every so often accompanied of wind.

""An uncommon underground block that when it appears, appears in large numbers in a cave. This block is a crystalline like substance that at 0 light appears to be a very dim gray-purple. However when ever the light value is above 0 (like you just suddenly tunnel in to it or place a torch) the whole crystal cave would light up in different colors, how? By assigning a color to each light value, with even numbers transitioning between odd numbers in color and reducing the light reduction value for just these blocks to 5% per light value instead of the standard 20%. (10% for the nether but that is not important) Thus giving you a display of light and color everywhere, perhaps can be used in place of glass for any form of telescope or some magic/potion system or something in crafting plans... but the MAIN idea is just a decorative multicolored crystal block that takes advantage of light to provide many colors from a single harvestable block.

Ill also post all the initial suggestions i got from there on here too. There will also be a ""TL:DR"" on the bottom.

Here is the link: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1445911-more-content-to-make-oceans-actually-interesting/

Here is the TL:DR (Last comment on the forum, which is mine)

In short, here the initial suggestions (the ones i had originally and are fairly easy to implement):
-Blue &amp; Black clams (Re-skinned mushrooms that only grow/spread underwater and can be made into soup)
-Sea weed (Re-skinned Sugar Cane, which only grows and can be placed underwater)
-Crab/lobster/SOME KIND OF CRUSTACEAN (Or at least a mob that crawls on the ocean floor so it is not a huge threat, but can come on land sometimes! If crabs, they come in Dirt, Sand, and Stone variety. Let crabs and seaweed be craftable into crab-rolls)

Here are the ""next"" suggestions which I got from the forum
-Fish mobs, both large and small. (Small ones swim away when hit and spawn anywhere, large ones retaliate and spawn in oceans only)
-Lilypads have ""stalks"" and perhaps ""Lily Pad seeds"" (Which can be placed on the bottom of a body of water, a stalk will grow up to the surface and upon contact will form a lily pad)
-Make fish farmable in some way
-Fish can either be fought on water or pulled onto land with a fishing rod where they will die
-Fish are attracted to fishing rod bobbers

Here are the final suggestions which i also found very good, but a bit much to ask for all at once! These are good ideas too, but like i said, are a bit much to get in one update.
-Generated ocean structures (Sunken temples, treasure islands, perhaps sunken temples have a lower floor that is partially flooded and has traps, perhaps a special ocean temple spawns a new boss mob
-New boss mob ""Giant Squid"" (Can drop a squid eye or something...)

Creepy.

It'd be cool to have generic mumbling and muttering, almost similar to the sounds that come out of a note block... just to imitate basic conversations. 

Ideally a single villager would make no noise, but whenever there were two or more villagers in a group they would have a conversation and you'd hear a sort-of ""womp womp donka-donk bup bup womp"" sound as they talk.

For bonus points, you could make the voices sound like the teachers on Charlie Brown :D :D

This would improve the general feel of the game, it'd make it more realistic AND more fun at the same time.

It would be easy to implement this.. The engine is already built, the code is already there -- every mob already makes generic vocal sounds (snorting, grunting, clucking, etc etc, Even creepers hiss when they're nearby). Villagers, as far as I can tell, are the *only* mob that does not make a generic vocal sound when nearby.

It seems to me this feature could probably be implemented by simply un-commenting the vocal sound code for villagers, or at the very most copy/pasting the vocal-noise code from any other mob.

You spend a lot of time shifting inventory around between chests and your personal inventory.  Since this is not the part of the game that's fun, I tend to rush through it, to get to the building/exploring/etc.  It is not to hard to move something to a chest and forget that you did that.

* Maybe i'm a little absent-minded, but i find with annoying frequency, that i'll start building something on the crafting square, but i don't actually have all the ingredients in my personal inventory, or not enough of something to make as many as i wanted.

* It would be great if we could *leave* the ingredients on the crafting table, go to a chest, get more stuff, return to the crafting table, and pick up with the recipe *where we left off*.  Some people would never use it, but for many of us, i think it would make the game more user friendly.

* Yes, i realize this would require that the crafting table become a tile entity.  The only downside i'm aware of is that pistons would no longer be able to push them.

------------------------

**EDIT 3:**
Commenters have brought up the issue that this change would make it more work to clear off the workbench.
Here's how i think it should work-- ideas taken from the conversation below:

* The crafting table GUI gets a new button labeled ""Clear All"" which returns all items to your inventory (if you have room).  This would be useful for regular crafting as well when you want to start over with a new recipe.

* When you leave items on a crafting table they are displayed above the top surface, like drops-- each in position relative to how it sat on the grid.  These items do not de-spawn, ever. These items are not picked up if a player walks next to, or on them.  If there is a block above the table, the items remain in position, but are not visible.

* If a player is using a crafting table, that table is ""locked"" to him until he is done using it.  Only one player can use a crafting table at a time.

* Breaking a crafting table drops all items.

Especially when your survival is tenuous, and you don't have the gear or torches to venture into the dark, or when while your crops/trees are growing, you want to do some long-range exploring.

I've seen several suggestions, some about keeping [the world processing while sleeping](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/10h0b0/real_sleeping/), and others about [keeping certain chunks active all the time](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/10ge9g/update_chunks_containing_beds_as_though_they_had/).  Both have the potential to slow down the game, and each only addresses half of the problem.  This suggestion is designed to solve the most annoying issues in a consistent way, while adding the minimum stress to the computer.

* 1) When a chunk is unloaded, it gets a timestamp. So when the chunk is reloaded the game knows how long the chunk has been inactive.

* 2) Right *after* a chunk is reloaded or a player wakes up, processes that take a fixed amount of time, such as animals growing up, player health regen, or furnace cooking would be automatically advanced by the amount of time a chunk was inactive, or the time a player was asleep.

* 3) EDIT: I now think #3 is likely impractical.
Processes that take a random amount of time such as crop and tree growth, would each have a short-cut calculation that approximates what their progress would be based on time elapsed and a *single* random roll.  In most cases this should add very little time to chunk reload.

* 4) This method would not work very well for simulating iterative growth like for vines or mushrooms. They would get at least *one* chance to reproduce, but that isn't exactly the same as the continual growth and spread that happen when the chunk is active for a long time. I don't see how that could be simulated without bogging down chunk re-load, or making the player wait longer for sleep to end.  I consider speed more important than accurately simulating these while the player is asleep or gone.

* 5) Fire spread, mob spawner spawning, mine carts and redstone, etc. would remain as is-- not calculated while the player if gone or asleep.  If Mojang can make any of these things work while the player sleeps or is away without a performance hit --good for them.  While i'm no Java coder, i'm making my best guess about what is realistically possible.  There's not much point in raising support and hopes for an impossible suggestion.

One aspect of this that's lost is the ability to have fire burning on the sides and the bottom. This made for additional aesthetic choices that are no longer available. My suggestion is to allow netherrack to be lit on fire on all sides. 

**Advantages:**

-Could pose new challenges in the nether (albeit slight). 

-Allows for additional aesthetic choices. 

**Disadvantages:**

-Some might feel ever burning fire upside down and on sides goes against the logic of Minecraft. 

-The aspect of only burning on top forces an amount of decision  to be made of how best to use that aesthetic. 

**Examples of potential use:**

-Burning ceilings. 

-As a light sources that can be placed on the underside of a block. 

-In challenge maps or adventure maps, provides new choices for the author. 

**My own opinion:** 

-It does not go against the ""feel"" of Minecraft, nor is it is illogical. 

-I've always expected this to be implemented since the ever burning logs went away.

Here are a few ideas for using those huge, deep oceans that are otherwise useless impediments to travel and adventure:

* Fish as mobs. Can be caught with poles, like any other mob when they're close to the surface. 

* Sharks as hostile mobs. More active at night, but - like the Creeper - they don't shun sunlight. Spawns in groups of 1-6. Drops Fish when killed, for simplicity's sake.

* Whales as ""spider-jockey""-level rare mobs with a crapton of health. Drops *a lot* of Fish when slain, again for simplicity's sake. It's all ""fish"" meat in a game made out of blocks.

All the mobs would drift up and down as they swam to and fro, so whales would occasionally surface and descend, as would sharks and fish, making their dynamic more interesting.

* Kelp as an underwater plant spawn. Basically Leaf blocks under water and along the surface of the water, but can't be walked on or placed once picked up. Kelp could be cooked and eaten or eaten raw, and maybe used in Alchemy for Water Breathing and Swim Speed potions.

* Coral as a somewhat rare underwater surface block that can be mined with a pickaxe and placed like any other decorative block. 

* Shipwrecks as ""temple""-level rare zone spawns. At the bottom of the ocean, but has rooms inside with air, zombies, and skeletons - maybe a spawner - and a treasure chest with booty, weapons and random potions (i.e. ""rum"").

* Sunken Villages as ""village""-level rare zone spawns. Also at the bottom of the ocean, these are unpopulated but have better loot in the blacksmith's chest - emeralds and whatnot.

Finally, two more ideas that aren't about spawning blocks or mobs, but still feel like they fit the theme of the Ocean ideas:

* Compass points to where it was crafted rather than your spawn point, much the same way maps are centered on where they are crafted. It would probably help if you could name a Compass upon crafting it (i.e. ""Home Compass"", ""Desert Village Compass"", etc.)

* Maps can be crafted into 3x3 Hanging Maps when used as the centerpiece of a Painting craft (i.e. surround the Map with Sticks). This would not create a random Painting, but the same Hanging Map that can be placed and moved like a normal Painting if desired.

1346744149.0,159,self.minecraftsuggestions,zbr0f,Slow day here at the office. So 20 suggestions!!,ShiDiWen,192,33,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/zbr0f/slow_day_here_at_the_office_so_20_suggestions/,"1) **Villagers retire to their own house at night**(Priests to church, butchers to store, etc). This will make them easier to track down for trading (for those of us against inhumane house arrests, prisons, etc). Free range NPCs are happier anyways. 


2) **Fermented Spiders Eye + Arrow = Poison tipped arrows**. Let's say one eye does 16 arrows, that fair? Dmg would be 1/2 heart every 2 seconds for 8 second period, or whatever it is that the low level poison potion does. 


3) **Music played from jukeboxes pacify mobs**. A great way to neutralize a dungeon! A superb way to sheer sheep!! A splendid way to torch a cave spider spawner!!! A great way to work on your farm without animals running away! Mobs will ""snap out of it"" if attacked while under the hold of the music. Otherwise they just kind of freeze on the spot and nod their head up and down to the tune. If I wanted to go really deep on this one I'd say each disc has it's own effect, like 13 actually incites them instead. Shamelessly stolen from Super Mario brothers 3. You are now hearing that lullabye. 


4) **Saddle a squid to ride the tides!** Same deal as pigs, but with fish attached to pole instead. 


5) **Let us sell our damned Lapis XD**...double that of gold seems fair, so 16-18 for one emerald. Rare buy from priests who use it in dying robes and such, I suppose. 


6) **New villager: Doctor/healer**: Buys dandilions, roses, seeds, spidereyes, gold (rare). Sells: lvl 1 Potions, lvl 2 Potions (rare), glistening melon, netherwart. 


7) **New villager: Artisan**: Buys: Ink sacks, lapis, feathers. Sells: dyes, dyed armor, dyed wool, paintings. 


8) **New Villager: Engineer**: Buys: redstone, Sells: repeaters, track, powered rail, pressure rail, dispensers, jukebox (rare). 


9) **Tamed wolves roam villages** Makes sense right? Steve isn't the only person in the chunk that has a dog. Surely. Plus the poor squidwards need all the protection they can get. These dogs will be tame but not controllable. Villagers will hate you if you hurt them, but be happy if you feed/heal them. 


10) **Update achievements with every update to encourage checking out new features**. Eg: Not If I See You First (kill a mob while invisible). 



11) [An old post of mine about Sun/moon phases](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/q3uap/neat_suggestion_special_sunmoon_phases/) 


12) **Rope and Pulley**. The backbone of all oldschool traditional mining. What kind of self respecting mine doesn't have a rope and pulley? Now instead of winding our way down to the mine (and back up for that matter), we go straight up/down from the entrance of the mine. We can attach a cart to ferry ourselves, or a chest to send up/down loot. Crafting would require 2 ingot for the pulley, 4 planks for the stand and a whole stack of string (spider string fiber is actually really strong, i saw this thing on discovery once). Can descend 64 meters. 



13) Two pieces of leather, iron, gold or diamond (arranged over each other like making a single boot) = **Codpiece** Can be worn instead of pants in the armor slot and grants 1/2 an armor of protection...but a very important 1/2 it is. 



14) **More Golems!!**. I sure do love my new desert village, but I'm a little jealous of folk that live in biomes where snow gollems actually work. So how about: 2x Hyroglyphic Sandstone + pumpkin for desert golem. Meh? He does what... I dunno...throw sand in your eyes I guess. 


15) **Hows about that blue flower in the handheld version**. Ya, how about that. It makes light blue dye, just so the Lapis market won't tank overnight ^like ^anyone ^cares 


16) [A potion of youth](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/qi0w3/spiffy_idea_potion_of_youth/) (also from an old thread of mine). 


17) **More discs, more sounds, more control**. Especially more control. I like to work to the tunes of MC discs from time to time. How about right clicking on the jukebox opens it like a chest and you can put any number of discs in it to store. You can also then chose random, continuous play, repeat song, etc. If a jukebox is destroyed it drops it's contents in the same way a chest would. 


18) **New ""Villager"": Hermit** (rare). Lives in extreme hills biome in a cave at the top of a mountain. His cave is a simple 5x5x5 hovel with a bed and single potted plant. Often has a cat. Buys: sugar. Sells: Diamond, gold and iron. 


19) **New Mini-Bosses** The thing that killed the miners, and the thing that killed the stronghold population. I think the game needs some explanation as to why these places are abandoned and that is that they were invaded and taken over by a new mob, forcing the NPCs to the surface where they made crude villages. Because both former bases are underground it should be a wurm of some sort. In the mine it can be found in the large square dirt room and in the stronghold in the jails. 


20) **Oil**: Found in those ungodly cracks/spaces in the bedrock. Can only be gathered with buckets. 1 bucket can smelt one stack of cobble. Highly flammable...so you can toss the bucket on something and then add a spark for an almost lava like effect. But unlike lava it'll eventually burn away like wood. Can be used as a fuel for hand held lanterns, which is in itself another idea for another time. 


Keep fit and have fun.

Obviously only one shot per load and you can move freely and change items in hot bar whilst keeping the crossbow loaded. Right click to load to crossbow, right click to aim crossbow (not aiming would either make shots less accurate or less powerful?) and then right click again to fire. Once aimed you move slowly like with a bow, to stop aiming with out having to fire the arrow simply left click.

A cool solution? Bring back the quiver.
We all love the quiver, and it'd be nice to add it back in. Crafted from leather and string and equipped in a new inventory box (similar to the armor boxes), you can place one stack of arrows into it as your primary arrow reservoir. When the quiver is empty or missing, the player fires whatever arrows they have in their inventory at random (just like reaching into your pocket and throwing whatever you have in it at an attacker). This gives the quiver a purpose to be brought back IF there are more arrow types... Which has been suggested a lot.

* Diamond: 3 minutes, 1-3 Wheat

Each tier farmland should have a distinct look, possible a light ting relating to what tier it was hoes with. Maybe the ruts in the soil would be better as the tiers gt higher.

* Stone would be slightly neater, but still a bit curvy.

I totally agree. These suggestions are not meant to be all or none, simply an amassment of some decent ideas as well as some of my own.**

**Thanks for the feedback guys!**

Everybody knows it. The ocean is boring as shit. Boats look wimpy as hell. The only fish we have are the fish in our inventories and item frames. The only mobs in the ocean are squid, and they're not very interesting. 

So many water 'feature' suggestions have been made in this sub. There's one on the front page as I write this, with one of the comments being 'I'm going to upvote every underwater content thread until we get some.'

**First, possibly most importantly: water mobs.**

Obviously things like fish, turtles, the like. There would be, I think, two types of fish: **'real' fish and 'aesthetic' fish.**

*'Real fish'* would be real entities, and (might) have hitpoints (very little, depending on the fish) obviously this idea needs more refinement as it is not very logical to punch fish to death underwater. 

* Here are some examples of fish: [[1]](http://imgur.com/uN6Y9zU) [[2]](http://imgur.com/bBRNENZ) Source: /u/jadezx

* A possible item to be introduced could be the fishing net. Basically, when you swing, it goes out in an arc in front of the player. If a 'real fish' is within the arc, it would be caught, just like fishing with a fishing rod. 
* Hopefully fish will come in different colours and shapes and sizes, just to keep things interesting.

*'Aesthetic fish'* would be fish that aren't entities: rather, they are textures that swim/float by in the ocean, to decorate it. There could be things like schools of small fish and larger fish, manta rays, and crustaceans to roam the ocean floor. That is, of course, if they are not turned into mobs themselves.

Also turtles. 

**Aggressive mobs**

* Jellyfish: these would only appear in deeper waters. They might look like blue slimes with tentacles. Obviously, they would shock you, but maybe they only attack when aggro'd. 
* A boss: most probably a kraken. Read more below. 

**A way to swim faster/breathe longer/see clearer**

Basically, [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1ahztm/enchantment_idea_boots_underwater_movement/) This would allow the (hopefully soon) huge and interesting ocean to be explored more easily and conveniently without having to go up for air every 5 seconds, especially when diving to deeper areas of the ocean.

**Plants!**

Coral reefs pls. More colour in the ocean. Different types of coral, mainly, I think, two types: 'effect' coral, 'brewing' coral, and 'aesthetic coral.'

*Effect coral*: possibly effects that either hinder or boost the player's abilities, for example, touching/hitting one type of coral could refill your oxygen meter, or maybe poison you. Coral that slows you down as you swim by, coral that shocks you as you pass, coral that acts as a sort of 'black hole' and pulls you towards it. 

*Brewing coral*: exactly what it says on the tin. Coral that can be harvested and made into potions, probably with water-related effects. Although there are already a few water-related effects, perhaps coral could provide a stronger effect or something. Also, brewing coral could be used for enchantments/enchanting books.

*Aesthetic coral*: like aesthetic fish, these just stay put and serve to decorate the ocean.

Also seaweed/kelp: these would act like vines, but that grow upwards. Like cobwebs, they slow down whatever goes through them. 

* [Example.](http://imgur.com/x6SYQbw) Source: /u/jadezx

**Boat improvements**

Currently, the only boat in minecraft is a brown rectangular prism in which a player sits. In my opinion, while this may be useful, it is very boring and not very aesthetically pleasing.
The ability to customize boats, to build bigger ones, would greatly improve this. However, as one user puts it, 

*'What is much more entertaining is having a boat that doesn't randomly smash on the shoreline due to bugs and lag. Lets get what we already have working before we start adding in boats we build from scratch.'*

If, however, larger boats to get added into minecraft, the question is how these boats would be made. Obviously you couldn't simply build a giant pirate ship and have it sail, that would be to OP. Instead, we could have something like different parts of the boat built in the crafting table and then placed in the water, where they would become larger and probably entities, to avoid farming of useful blocks.
The boat would only work when all required parts are put into place. Also, the sails should be customizable. :P


**-EDIT- as I said in the comments:**

&gt; I think this would be too gamebreaking as well as near-impossible to implement. How would the engine be able to detect what's part of the ship and what's not? How would it move like current boats do? It would only be able to move in 1 direction, because of the fact that it is made of real blocks.
For this reason, if larger boats are implemented, they cannot be completely custom made and will probably have to be entities.


**Suggested by /u/androidyl: enchant boats with unbreaking.** and by extension, ability to enchant boats, i.e with speed

**The Kraken... or, giant squid.**

The Kraken would be the boss of the ocean. It would only appear when you have your own *large boat* (see above) and would have tentacles that you would have to kill individually. Think something like [this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8Cf2vTxJgA) (sorry for bad quality.) 

* During the fight with the kraken, its tentacles would attempt to smash and/or flip your boat. Your boat would obviously lose durability and it should be up to the player to attempt to fix it as fast as possible while keeping the kraken at bay (no pun intended.)
* The kraken would have a weak spot: its eyes.
* When killed, the kraken should fall to the bottom of the sea and become a gargoyle that the player can go into and find treasure. 

**Underwater villages**

With hostile merpeople. 
What else can I say?

I know that's not ideal, but All of these ideas I'm going to present must work together to achieve the effect I want. Most of these ideas will only be interesting to mapmakers, and you will need creative mode and external editors.

**TL;DR:** Give Villagers the ability to talk, and be able to define paths for them. Also some other stuff.

Ok, so these ideas came to me while I was thinking about making a pirate town adventure map. 

The only problem was that player-made towns with Villagers always feel like ghost towns, because the villagers either must be captured if used for shops, or they tend to wander off if used as civilians. They also create an eerie atmosphere by pointlessly wandering around and never saying a word.

So, how to fix this?

I thought about the following:

**Giving Villagers dialogue lines**

Every Villager should have 5-10 lines of dialogue at hand. These  would refer to his profession and to his environment. They could appear in speech bubbles over their heads, for example.

 It should be possible to edit them with NBT editors, for example by creating a list named CustomLines and then putting compound tags containing the line and the conditions under which the line should be displayed.

Conditions could be:

* It's raining
 
 This could cause villagers to say something along the lines of ""This rain is good for my crops"" or ""Come inside, you're soaking wet""

* It's getting dark

 Villagers could respond to this with ""Oh no, they're coming!"" or ""Good night""

* The Sun is coming up again

 The response to this could be a sipmle ""Good Morning""

* Attacking or killing a Villager could cause his fellow Villagers to back away from you and say ""Get away from me!"" or ""Please, don't kill me!""

 Maybe these lines wouldn't show up in creative mode, I can see them becoming annoying.

They also could have simple lines referring to their profession, like:

""My crops are growing well"" for the Farmer,

""The work with the forge is hard, but it's the only work for me"" for the Blacksmith or

""Say Praise!"" for the Priest. (These are just a few, but you can see where I'm going with this)

Issue number two would be the aimless wandering. This isn't as much of a problem with vanilla villages, but it is with player-made towns. It can, however, be countered by:

**Defining multiple paths for Villagers**

To do this without external editors, a new item which is only available in creative mode must be introduced. Let's call it the ""Pathfinder"" for now.

To define a path for a villager, right click him with the pathfinder. Then, right click several blocks as ""Waypoints"", and the game would calculate a [spline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics\)) which would then be the path. To close a path, return to the villager and right click him again with the pathfinder. A villager could have multiple paths, and randomly choose from them.

**EDIT:** Thanks, /u/VoxaAeterna!

Paths could easily be stored within Lists containing compound tags, which again would consist of several Int tags which contain the coordinates of the waypoints.

There also could be dialogue lines to be displayed when a specific waypoint is reached. Furthermore, Villagers could wait at waypoint for a specific amount of time. 

There are also some smaller things which could greatly improve the feeling Villagers create:

**Giving them the ability to sleep in beds**

This would require some minor changes to village generation, meaning there should be beds placed within each house and Villagers would sleep in them at night.

**Not all Villagers are traders**

This would be only for mapmakers, because having every civilian on the street trying to offer you goods is a tad unrealistic. This could be realized easily by adding a byte tag to Villagers, called something along the lines of ""Trader"", which would default to 1 (meaning the Villager is a trader)

**Adding the Invulnerability tag to Villagers**

Minecarts seem to have it, Villagers don't. This makes little sense in my opinion.

That's all. I know, it's, much, but it would greatly improve the game's atmosphere.

---

**Spawning:**

It could spawn only in plains biomes during a full moon, on blocks that have a skylight level above a certain amount. I also considered near villages, but villages already have sieges. It would spawn riding a skeleton horse.


**Appearance and Behavior:**

The skeleton that spawns could be wearing full black leather armor save for a helmet, with infinite invisibility and minor resistance applied to it. The invisibility effect would give the look that it has no head. It would also be holding a skeleton skull in its hands, and attack by charging you with its horse for massive damage.

**Killing it:**

The skeletal horse is unable to be killed by most means, so you must attack the rider. Killing the horseman causes the horse to despawn in a puff of smoke. If the rider is not killed by day time by a player, it will immediately despawn at morning.

**Drops a skeleton skull upon death:**

Successfully killing the horseman will cause it to drop a skeleton skull, which can then be used for decoration.

**Possible weakness to gold tools**

In the legends dullahans were also repelled by gold. We already have gold tools in the game, so why not?

We here at /r/minecraftsuggestions are a humble group, and we certainly don't want to tell you how to live your lives, but I have been getting some disturbing messages about users being harassed or repeatedly insulted.

Your opinions are yours, and we welcome constructive criticism, but /r/minecraftsuggestions should be a friendly place where you feel safe to share your two cents with no strings attached.

So here are a few suggestions I would like to offer to help make things a little better for everyone:

* Please don't insult each other. Ever. There's no reason for it.
* If someone criticizes your idea, take it lightly. Feel free to talk it out, but if you are going to have a 1-on-1 conversation, make sure it stays friendly.
* Be forgiving.
* If you are going to criticize someone's idea, realize that they may have strong feelings for it and try to be empathetic.

Folks, I just want you to realize that there are people attached to the other end of those usernames, and whether or not you see it, insulting someone, or harassing them is cruel, and it does real damage.

Do what I do: If you ever get angry at someone, type out the message, **and then delete it**. It's quite cathartic and then you won't get into a fight.

**Be nice to one another!**

We all have bad days, but anger is infectious. So is kindness.

This kinda (obviously) ticked me off. I'm understanding for a death on my hardcore world if its my fault, like if I fell in lava or a mob killed me. However, this death is beyond player control, there are no ways to evade the dragon if he spawns on top or right in front of the player. 

Basically, There needs to be a grace period for the player to at least get on the island.  Or make the platform spawn on the island.

My Suggestion:  Sleeping Dragon (un-damageable or off-screen and flies in) that awakens upon first crystal getting blown up. That way, there are no unpreventable deaths for players in the end.

A lot of players want more things to mine, but not just more materials to make tools and armor out of.  Salt could help fill that niche, and have some fun uses.  The level it's mined at isn't that important to me.

**Uses**

Crafting food.  I know there's plenty of food already, but this is sort of the obvious use.  Maybe a vegetable stew with the new veggies?

Sow it into the dirt to stop grass from growing.

Lay it out in a line (like redstone dust) that some kinds of hostile mobs will not cross.  There's some folklore about demons and vampires not crossing a line of salt, maybe it'd work for witches or skeletons?

Combine with a bucket of water to make a source block that will not freeze.

Craft salt blocks.  These may attract livestock, but that's not essential.  What is essential is if they touch water, they will begin to crack, as if being mined, until they break.  This could be used for a kind of single-use water timer or construction projects that are designed to disintegrate, etc.

So, more fun for miners, more fun for monster fighters, more fun for builders without giving any crazy powers.

**Edit**: Some ideas that came up from the comments:

Salt could damage slimes, due to their sluggish physiology.

Salt should be fairly RARE and VALUABLE, as it was in pre-industrial times.  Maybe villagers would pay a good price for it, and it should be non-trivial to obtain.  It could be restricted to certain biomes (salt flats, anybody?) or underground in a narrow range of elevation, maybe rare, large veins, or under ground only in certain biomes?",,False,,t5_2s3oo,1353407715.0,,,True,t3_13hj6h,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/13hj6h/salt/,

For those unaware, the game runs in ""ticks"" ([Tick - Minecraft Wiki](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Tick)) one tick is 1/20th of a second and as a result there are 20 ticks per second.

Depending on what you are doing at the time, on every tick you have a small chance of something happening (a drop from a mob, wheat growing into the next stage, a wither skeleton spawning etc.) A traditional use for this throughout gaming history is having random events happening. Like the weather, these events would come and go at random and would force the player to adapt, even for a short period of time, to the new circumstances. A more familiar example would be Terraria having Goblin Invasions and ""Blood Moon"" events every so often after a certain point in the game has been reached (E.g. The Goblin Army won't invade if you haven't acquired the musket yet.)

Obviously the possibilities are almost endless as to what you could do but I would like to hear some ideas from everyone for random events. A couple that I like are:

A flock of birds targeting your farm areas. A message pops up sating something to the effect of ""Your crops are being eaten by crows!"" and you have to run and kill all the birds before they destroy your farm. The birds could just use a similar flying pattern to the bats and just fuck up all your plants.

Some genius guy in /r/minecraft posted [this very simple screen shot](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/19y6xq/when_a_meteor_landed_in_my_front_yard/) showing a concept for End Stone meteorites that crash down every once in a while. What an amazing idea, End Stone has the highest blast resistance in the game besides Obsidian. Making these small chunks of End Stone pretty valuable before The End has been reached. And what if the meteorites had something like a metallic core? Near the center of each one there could be a small chance of 1-2 iron blocks spawning. The earliest metal weapons in human history were crafted using metal from meteorites long before smelting was invented.

Additionally, perhaps mobs can spawn even in higher light levels there, so you can't fully secure a stronghold by lighting it up. I'm not entirely sure how viable this part is.

When leading mobs over somewhat rough ground, it is hard to predict when a mob will get loose.  You need to continually look over your shoulder, if you want to keep all the mobs to your destination.

It would be helpful, (and coincidentally realistic) if a sound would play when a mob breaks away from a Lead, giving the attentive player something to react to.

**EDIT:** Ryan_Ash makes the great suggestion that there should also be a rope stretching sound as the lead gets near the point of breaking.  Both sounds together would really give you nice, natural feedback.

In the humble days of Beta, the creator of Minecraft, Notch, decided to revolutionize the game of Minecraft in a single update known as 1.8: The Adventure Update. Within this update many overhauls were done, many blocks added, and just plenty of new additions and tweaks overall.

One of these overhauls was in relation to the terrain. Rather than just the three original biomes of Desert, Forest, and Taiga that defined the Minecraft overworld, Notch decided to add more. The biomes now included forests, plains, extreme hills, taigas, ice plains (tundras), swamps, oceans, rivers, deserts, the elusive mushroom islands, and later on Jeb's addition of jungles. 

However, there was a problem with most of the biomes: they were ridiculously flat and without variation. To fix this, the term known as ""x-hills"" were implemented, which are sub-biomes within biomes that were more hilly than the standard terrain. This slightly fixed the high variation problem.

Again, there was another problem with the new biomes: messy biome boundaries in regards to immediate grass/leaf color changes. To compensate for this, there were transitioning colors added. These helped, but the eye sore still remains. And this suggestion is how I think this should be fixed.


**The Suggestion - Transition Biomes**

Now, if you didn't already conclude to yourself what transition biomes will be, I'll gladly explain my thoughts on what they could be.

Say you generated a new Minecraft world, and it had a Plains biome next to a Forest biome. Rather than there just being a slight transition in grass color, why not a new biome to put between the Plains and the Forest? It could look like this:


Plains / Forest -&gt; *Forest Plains*


This new *Forest Plains* biome would have less trees and rough hills than the Forest biome, but more trees and height variation than the Plains biome. Horses would spawn more rarely in *Forest Plains* than regular Plains, but they could still spawn there.

Now, to get more in depth, there could be multiple transition biomes that could occur between two biomes, or even shared transition biomes between different biomes. That's a little wordy, but here's some examples:


**In regards to the multiple transition biomes between two biomes:**


Plains / Forest -&gt; *Forest Plains*

Plains / Forest -&gt; *Savannah*


**In regards to the shared transition biomes between different biomes:**


Plains / Forest -&gt; *Savannah*

Plains / Jungle -&gt; *Savannah*


***Of course, implementing this would take some time and thought, but I believe the outcome would be phenomenal. What do you guys think?***




**More Examples**

Plains / Swamp -&gt; *Marshes*

Plains / Desert -&gt; *Arid Plains*

Forest / Extreme Hills -&gt; *Forested Hills*

Desert / Extreme Hills -&gt; *Dry Hills*

Desert / Ice Plains -&gt; *Tundra*

Desert / Swamp -&gt; *Bog*

Ice Plains / Extreme Hills -&gt; Snow-Capped Hills

**Also, feel free to share your own ideas for transition biomes!**

[from Minecraft Forum],badasspiggy,165,27,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1c5nbs/cubic_chunks_eliminate_xray_hacks_and_reduce_lag/,"The following post was made by Calacbolg on Minecraft Forum:


Overview:

With the introduction of the Infdev update, Minecraft gained the ability to generate virtually infinite worlds by utilizing the new chunk system, hence the update's name. By breaking the world into individual pieces, chunks eliminated the need for the entire world to be generated at one time - Minecraft could generate new chunks as needed.
However, chunks cannot be partially generated; entire chunks must be generated all at once. This means, that the larger the chunk, the laggier it becomes to generate. The same principle applies to loading and simulating a chunk. It is for this reason that Minecraft is limited to 256 blocks in building height.
The solution to this issue is to change the type of Minecraft's chunk system. Currently, Minecraft uses a linear chunk system, but by changing this to a cubic chunk system, height can be completely eliminated as an aspect of lag.


Technical Details:

It might sound too good to be true. Many of you are probably wondering how this could possibly function correctly without wiping everything clean, or how it could possible reduce lag instead of increasing it. That's why I'll attempt to explain this the best I can in the following sections.
Part of the beauty of this systems lies in the fact that it leaves much the same. A few glaring issues, such discussed below, require a radical change in only a few isolated areas.

Data Storage:

Currently, linear chunks are stored in the MCRegion format, in groups of 32•32 chunks, or 1024 chunks. This allows for much more efficiency in chunk handling than just simply storing each individual chunk. Under this system, however, 323 chunks would be way too much and very inefficient. Instead, the new '3DRegion' format would contain a 163 cube of chunks, for a total of 4096 chunks, which is 4 times the number of chunks in current MCRegion files. However, the 3DRegion format contains only 1/4th the number of blocks, and requires the same amount of bits(4) for positional metadata as the MCRegion format(After compression). After conversion, the same area encompassed by current MCRegion files will take up around 64 extra kilobytes shared between 4 new 3DRegion files. As such, it would take 16 MCRegion files to add up to a single extra megabyte in filesize.
As an optimization utilized for efficacy in filesize and elsewhere, empty chunks(Chunks containing only air) are not loaded nor stored in the 3DRegion files. Instead, they are simply classified as 'Empty'. This classification adds 1 bit to every chunk, but removes a variable(But usually large) value of data from each 3DRegion.
Biomes are currently tied to entire columns of blocks inside linear chunks. Due to the impracticality of the same system under cubic chunks, biomes are changed to be tied with whole chunks instead, consequently creating the possibility of three dimensional biomes, which in turn allow for such things as subterranean, oceanic, and other height/depth related biomes; as well as very intricate, but entirely randomly generated structures created through simple to complex parameters of biome placement. At places where biome transitions would be accurate, at biome borders(Which will inevitably slice through copious amounts of chunks due to the biome map created from the world seed), chunks containing the border will be identified as a technical biome named 'transition'. 'Transition' biomes simply smooth biome transitions through taking properties of biomes of surrounding chunks, as would be expected.

Coping with sunlight:

This is one of the glaring issues that requires a total rewrite of something. Quite simply, there is no good way to utilize the current system of sunlight calculation to tell if something is open to the sky. Cubic Chunks requires an imaginative solution in the form of the 'Heightmap'.
The 'Heightmap' system actually consists of many individual heightmaps, each 'map' being stored as a linear chunk system of 162 block chunks, those blocks being the highest block at each given XZ coordinate pairing within a given Y coordinate range, ignoring air. There are two kinds of heightmaps, the per-3DRegion type(Every single 3DRegion file gets its own 16 by 16 chunk heightmap of the highest blocks within it), and the global heightmap(Created by compiling blocks from the per-3DRegion heightmaps into a global grid of the absolute highest block at each XZ coordinate pairing), which there is only one of.
The only data stored to the blocks inside these chunks is their block type and their Y-Coordinate. By comparing the Y-coordinate of a block to the global heightmap, the sunlight level of that block can be calculated at any level. In such case that a block is within 15 blocks below a block existing on the global heightmap, all the blocks between those two blocks will be checked, to accurately detect the amount of sunlight decay for use in sunlight calculations.
The heightmap is updated at many turns, world generation, world simulation, chunk loading, and block updates. If some of the blocks in the global heightmap are removed, and no suitable replacements exist in loaded chunks to replace the remove blocks, single chunks of per-3DRegion heightmaps are loaded downwards until a replacement is found, skipping empty heightmap chunks. This system means that no matter what, you can only experience the lag of one 162 block chunk loading for every 16 vertical chunks you've generated. The conditions to turn such a system laggy would be very precise and exceedingly improbable, as it would require a chain of generated chunks vertically on the order of thousands of chunks long without a single block at a certain XZ coordinate pairing, but yet one block every 16 chunks.
Upon initial world generation, the global heightmap is generated from the perlin noise map used to generate the actual world. This generation would be a rough estimate, but would be easily smoothed once the chunks containing those blocks are generated. This allows for world generation mods to do things such as generate skylands thousands of blocks in the air, and still have their shadow exist.

Overall lag reduction:

Now that I've explained how this works, you probably want to know the specifics in how this reduces lag. Other than the fact that a 163 block chunk is MUCH easier to load than a 256-high chunk, the main lag reduction lies in the fact that under this system, the view distance is a sphere, not a cylinder. That alone reduces the handled data on an order of around 33%. Alongside the empty chunk optimization discussed above, the lag reduction could actually be on an order of one third.
On SMP, servers can use the same chunk occlusion system as OpenGL to identify the chunks that are visible to a player, and only send(They're still loaded) the data of those visible chunks to the player. This reduces connection lag between the server and clients, and reduces client-side lag. It also has the side-effect of nearly completely eliminating X-Ray hacks.

Special-Case Chunk-Loading:

As just said, loading a 163 block chunk is much, much easier than a 16•16•256 block chunk. As such, things like Redstone circuitry can load adjacent chunks on latent ticks with little impact. This means you could build circuitry larger than ever before. Could this result in a lot of lag? Yes, it could. However, normal redstone circuitry can already do that.


Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: This is impossible.
A: No it's not. Additionally, if it is possible for a single modder to accomplish with only some help from other modders, it is more than possible for an entire developer team such as Mojang to replicate and optimize the system.

Q: Won't people in PvP/Raid/Anarchy servers just build a sky base up at Y1000+ or a cave base down below Y-1000 and never be found?
A: Servers can and have always been able to designate a maximum build height(Check Server.properties). With the implementation of this system, they would also be able to designate a 'minimum-generation-height' value, which would cause the Void, bedrock layer, and lava lakes to generate at(And above) that layer like they usually do now.

Q: Will this affect Redstone at all?
A: Yes, in one way only - Redstone circuitry will be able to be larger than before without running into chunk loading issues due to specialized chunk loading becoming viable under this system.

Q: Won't this break existing worlds?
A: No! Existing worlds can easily converted by dividing each MCRegion file into 4 pieces, then slicing the existing 256 block-high chunks inside them into 16 individual chunks.

Q: Will this affect mods?
A: Yes...and no. It's hard to say. Parts of mods that rely on chunks, chunk metadata, and/or coordinates may need some rewriting.

Q: Couldn't a player fall into unloaded chunks if chunks don't load fast enough?
A: No, they couldn't. Since empty chunks are completely ignored, only chunks that you could possibly land on are loaded, which aren't going to be plentiful as you're falling. Even in such cases when loaded chunks would be plentiful, the client can easily pause your fall until new chunks are loaded.

Q: What happens when sand or water falls into an unloaded chunk?
A: What happens when a minecart or mob moves into an unloaded chunk? It freezes in place until such a time as it can continue moving.

Q: Won't something that falls into the Void fall forever due to empty chunks being generated infinitely downwards?
A: No. In such places where the Void should be, the Void will remain even after conversion to Cubic Chunks. After the conversion, the Y coordinate of the Void can be altered by a new NBT tag associated with a world's level.dat. After a designated Void point, chunks will simply not generate, and normal Void-like effects will apply.
In the case of Superflat worlds, a possible parameter is added to the decoration list of the Superflat world preset, 'void'. Inclusion of this parameter forces the Void to form immediately below the bottom-most defined layer of the world. Exclusion of the parameter allows a Superflat world to generate infinitely downwards, with layers below the bottom-most defined layer copying the parameters of that layer and generating with applicable decoration parameters. Existing Superflat worlds retain their Void but this may be edited via NBT tags which will allow infinite downwards generation as normal.

Q: Will this affect terrain?
A: Maybe. However, terrain has nothing to do with this suggestion outside of the fact that this system gives terrain generators infinite vertical space to work with.",,False,,t5_2s3oo,False,,,True,t3_1c5nbs,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1c5nbs/cubic_chunks_eliminate_xray_hacks_and_reduce_lag/,

This would give the sense that you are entering an age-old domain, where this civilization once lived and fell, leaving behind a powerful secret, the End.

In abandoned mineshafts, the skellies and zombies could spawn more often with picks, leather clothes, maybe holding a torch or something. This would show that these miners who once dug out the precious ores of the world were overrun by the undead and were infected.

Now this is kind of boring and although realism is not always the best way to improve this game, I think most players can agree that weather can and should be improved. So, my suggestions for more weather types:

**Drizzle**
Similar to rain, except it has less particles and doesn't make any noise (begone rain noise!). Maybe more common in Plains?

**Heavy Rain (with or without thunder)**
A bit ""heavier"" and louder than normal rain (which by the way could be a bit less loud), also could fall diagonally instead of vertically. More common in Jungle.

**Blizzard**
What you can imagine, more snow particles and falls diagonally. Also, (now that we have snow layers), it could make the snow on the ground stack up to maybe half a block. It also reduces your visibility. Only happens rarely in Ice Plains and Taiga.

**Diamond Dust**
A kind of rare event even in real life, but it could also happen in MC VERY rarely only in Ice Plains.

**Hail**
You could take small amounts of damage during an hailstorm. It could last a short amount of time. Also only in snowy biomes.

**Sandstorm**
Like hail, it could make you take damage but also reduces your visibility. It could last longer than hail.

**Cloudy Skies**
Clouds are also a bit boring now. There could be days when the skies become darker or days when they are totally clear.

Just a little note about fog: I'm not very fond of the ""forced"" render distance effect of fog  and I'm sure that most players wouldn't like that either.

I really feel that the biome generator needs some sort of alothogrim that makes biome spawning make sense. In real life, there aren't any hot, humid, or arid climates smack-dab next to a tundra! 

Now, how would this work? The biome spawning would be something like this.

If desert generates, woodlands, jungles, or oceans can generate around it. If woodlands geneartes, ocean, tundra, taiga, swamp, or mountains can generate around it.

It would apply a sense of realism to biomes. 
Now, some other improvements. These would include,
Adding an edge, or border to all biomes. It would allow the two biomes to kinda mix and/or show a form of seperation.
Make deserts not spawn with these pools of water everywhere. In reality, all life in a desert would suck that water out of the ground, it'd be gone for heaven's sake! Instead, add an oasis that can randomly spawn, which would contain grass, cattle, a few trees, and water.

Now, for a bigger suggestion...
Remove the frozen plains biome. You may wonder why I believe this.
The frozen plains biome to me and many others is stupid, and a waste of space that another biome could use. Instead, make snow possible in most biomes. The snow would remain on the ground for at least 2-3 minecarft days before melting. Yes, rain and snow in one biome.

And finally, add more variation to biomes. I'm not whining about,"" O, I Wan oll teran genratr back xD"". No. Just re-add gravel beaches and possibility of great large hills in biomes. Nothing too big.
Thankyou all for reading this, and I'd appreciate your opinions.

NEW BIOME: Rain-forest biome. Generates around jungles. The biome is made up of rolling hills and tall 
tropical looking mahogany trees, which when cut down, would be used as another way to craft jungle wood planks. Leaf bushes aren't as frequently placed as in jungle biomes, neither are vines. Another new block, the Iris would generate rarely. An iris would be used to farm pineapples. For those who don't know, an iris is a type of flower. 
In the real world, jungles are defined as ""An area of land overgrown with dense forest and tangled vegetation, typically in the tropics."" This biome would just add more variation to the game, adding an extra area to build, a new food source, etc.

At the moment, cauldrons are mostly useless unless you are washing leather armour. Wooden bowls are also useless, as they can only hold mushroom stew.


**The Solution:**

By filling a cauldron with water, putting fire or lava under it, and waiting a couple minutes, the cauldron will be filled with boiling water. The cauldron will make a bubbling sound similar to lava and bubbles will appear and rise in the water. Now that the water is hot, you can add items (using Q) and begin making soup.


**Ingredients:**

You can add most foodstuffs to your soup. Throw in some pork, fish, beef, chicken, carrots, potatoes, pumpkins, mushrooms, etc. 


**Details:**

Once you have added up to **4 ingredients,** you can right-click with a wooden bowl to fill it with soup. This will completely empty the cauldron. The colour of the soup will change based on the ingredients (like dying leather armour) and the amount of hunger and satiation granted by the soup will be determined by different combinations of ingredients that work well together or go against each other.

It should go 1, 2, 1 1/2, 3, 4.



  Judging by what's confirmed for 1.6, villagers are screwed. Zombies attract hordes, have smarter AI, and FREAKING UNDEAD HORSES! Ok, I know those haven't been implemented in the snapshots yet, but they're in the game code and will probably be added soon. Anyway, villagers had it really hard before, but now they'll be basically extinct unless they are made a lot stronger. Here are a few things that would help:

1. GOLEM? WE HAVE A GOLEM?

Almost every village in a regular world, not superflat, is too small for a golem to spawn. The requirement to have a golem should be 10 villagers and 14 houses, 2/3 of what it is now, so about a quarter of villages will have golems. The rest won't need them, because...

2. FIGHTING BACK!

Ever found it strange that villagers don't defend themselves? They're strong enough to build villages, have chests full of swords and armor, giant freaking murderbot golems,and butchers whose job it is to slaughter animals all day, but when they're stuck in their house with a zombie breaking down their door, they just stand there and let it kill them. Suggestion #2 will fix that. First of all, there should be a new kind of villager, called the warrior. Warriors will have swords and occasionally armor (I see zombie villagers in armor sometimes, why not living ones?). At night, instead of going inside, they'll help out the golem with patrolling the village, or just patrol by themselves if there is no golem, and kill zombies and skeletons on sight. 

Oh, wait, I forgot one.

1 1/2. DAMNIT, IRON FARMERS!

Ok, so if there's more golems spawning, some asshole is going to abuse it by building mob grinders at their spawn points. That's why golems, when they're getting hurt badly by something that's not a mob or player, will get pissed and start randomly rage-punching and breaking lots of blocks around them.

3. WIZAAAARDS (JUST KIDDING, THEY'RE DRUIDS)

So witches, which live in swamps, are basically villagers that use potions. According to most players' interpretations of Minecraft's ""storyline"", including my own Unofficially Official History of Minecraft, they lived in villages until they were kicked out for being evil/batshit insane. What about the potion-using villagers that aren't insane? They should be in villages too, and be called druids. Their house could have a cauldron and brewing stand, and they trade potions/potion ingredients. They behave like witches, throwing potions and stuff, but the difference is they heal themselves and other villagers, and harm monsters. They may either stay home at night or patrol with the warriors and golems.

4. WE NEED MOAR BABIES!

Villagers breed more, until 2/3 of the houses are full, not 1/3 like it is right now. 


That's it, really. Now this may seem overpowered, but think about villagers for a second. They're supposed to be tough and self sufficient. Players are not their saviors or guardians, they're just people who come to trade occasionally. The way villagers are right now, it seems that they spent all those years building a civilization, fighting off zombies, and generally being badasses, until the player comes and they become stupid sheeple that need to be protected every night or they go extinct. So anyway, that's my suggestion. Hope you like it.

This has to be explained! Notch mentioned that he might add them as NPC villagers, but ultimately decided on the current villager model. Jeb, during a Q&amp;A at Minecon 2012, you mentioned that you would like to expand on the complexity of villagers. While creating the villager trading system, you first experimented with rubies, but decided to go with emeralds due to Dinnerbone being colorblind. In 1.6, new blocks such as hay and hardened clay are being added. So what is all of this leading up to, you ask? Prepare to be mindblown. ;D I think that there has never been a better opportunity to finally add pigmen to the game. Here is my idea. Minecraft would have two variant types of villager mobs - the current villager model, and pigmen. Pigmen would be a more primitive, native type of villager. They would live in hardened clay huts with hay block roofs. Their villages would be smaller than the current villages added. Since they would be their own type of villager mob, they would have their own currency which differentiates them from the current villagers. Pigmen would trade with rubies, and ruby ore (which still exists in the game files) could be added back into the game as a rare, possibly biome specific find, like emeralds. This concept also supports the current ""zombie infection"" theme it seems Minecraft is developing. Zombies could possibly siege these pigmen villages as well, and create zombie pigmen upon death (spread of the infection), since zombie pigmen in the overworld I feel are far too rare. Now is the perfect time to implement pigmen! I believe that my idea embraces all of these new and once promised features, and rolls them into one neat package for everyone to enjoy. Jeb, you confirmed that there would be new mobs in the 1.6 update, but so far all I have seen are horses and a bunch of horselike variants. Let's implement these pigmen finally! :)

Thanks for taking the time to read my ideas. I have much administrative experience on moderately sized Minecraft servers. I know what the players, and myself, want. I personally enjoy this game very much and I think that Mojang is doing a fantastic job with adding to it. But I am just a little concerned that you guys are forgetting about the features which have already been promised but never added. I am worried that too much focus is being put on the new, rather than following through with some old. If you read this Jeb, or Dinnerbone, or anyone from Mojang actively working on Minecraft, I am just a concerned server administrator. My focus, like yours, is to make this already wondrous game even better. I have more ideas, but I felt that this was the most significant, and the others were too long for a single post. Anyway, please give me some reassurances! :P Thanks again.

Of course this impairs vision. You can solve that by adding a new heart icon in the GUI to represent 10 hearts; when you lose health you lose regular hearts as usual until you have no more, then you lose one ""tenfold heart"" and the regular hearts go back to 10, and so on.

It's considered useless to weigh an item amount if you can just use a comparator on any storage block, besides you can't easily automatically pick them up afterwards.

Currently the ways of automatically distinguishing mobs is done by their volume and by exploiting their AI (though not always 100% reliable). However, it would be very helpful for automated systems if each mob would have a different weight;

* Separation of all kinds of mobs.
* Separation of zombies and villager-zombies.
* Detection of armor on mobs and which type (leather is lighter than gold).
* Weigh how much there's in a donkey's chest (plus the donkey itself).
* Weigh how much the player is carrying (plus the player itself).
* Weigh how many players are standing on a pad (easy analog group voting).
* Measure a slime's size.
* Measure if horses, pigs or donkeys have a saddle equipped.
* Estimate how much a villager is carrying (and thus know about how many trades he offers).
* Measure if entities have received a nametag.
* Measure if an enderman is holding a block.
* Measure how many mobs are in a holding area.

Additionally, if somehow we would be able to push them without them breaking off, we'd be enabled to measure 1 block high mobs;

* Differentiate between the baby and adult versions of animals.
* Measure if sheep have regrown their wool yet.

I think this pretty much sums up why I think this is a good idea. Please comment if you feel inclined to do so. Vote accordingly.

This heat would cause damage to living entities, but would not destroy vehicles or items. The damage caused would depend on whether lava or fire is touching the coal, and perhaps also depend on the height of the lava. Water on top of the coal could negate the damage at least partially, so while coal-on-lava would cause damage, water-on-coal-on-lava might not.

What are potential uses for this? You could have a floor of coal blocks which is normally benign, but at the flick of a lever, a dispenser dispenses lava beneath the floor, and the floor becomes deadly without any visual change.

(smooth stone slab),Fubaka,157,31,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/16ujx4/keep_slab_447_smooth_stone_slab/,"As some of you know, the next major Minecraft update (1.5) will add Nether Quartz to the game, a marble-like substance that can be used decoratively.  In addition there will be a slab variety of it as well, which will take the block I.D. of 44:7.  This would all be fine and good, if it wasn't erasing a block that already held that position.

The block it is erasing is known as Slab 44:7, Smooth Stone Slab, or in some places, as Cubestone.  The block is almost identical to the standard Stone Slab, except that when stacked, it shows the top face on all sides of the block.  (It doesn't have the crease in the middle)

Here is an image of 44:7 for comparison: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/File:Newstoneslab.png

(You can spawn it yourself by using /give 44:7 in Minecraft)

Many people have stated already that this block should be removed since it was never formally introduced into the game.  However, in many places, including my home server, we use the block extensively in our builds, and actually herald it as our official server block.  It would be unfortunate if we end up having to give it up.

If the old wooden slabs are still in the game to preserve builds, then why can't this one be too?  Better yet, you guys could officially implement it into the game by making it craftable using the regular stone slab blocks.  Say... 2 stone slabs on top of each-other in the crafting grid, for instance.

(As a final note, please be aware that I am not suggesting we ditch Nether Quartz.  I think those new blocks will be very pretty.  I just want the current 44:7 slab to be saved, and have the Nether Quartz slab take 44:8 instead.)

Mojang, Jeb, please save this block!

Update:  After learning more about why this form of slab exists, I propose an alternate idea.  Instead of keeping the slab, why not just make the doubleslab:7 its own block?  That way you keep your slab count down to 4 bits, and we still have our doubleslab:7.  You could call it Cubestone, and it could have its own crafting recipe. (Like the one mentioned above)

Update 2:  Jeb has listened, and we are eternally grateful!  This block has been saved!

Instead of leaf blocks dropping item-based saplings, the saplings could drop similar to the way that arrows fall (minus doing harm to the player of course), landing in the nearest horizontal piece of land. If the land is dirt, the sapling stays and has a chance to grow, but if the piece of land is anything else (water, stone, gravel, etc.) then the sapling pops back up as an item, similar to a mushroom under too much light. If a player is simply harvesting a tree for wood and finds saplings raining down, they need only smack the sapling to return it to item format to keep it from growing.

This way, if a fire rips through a jungle or forest biome, some saplings could be left behind to grow back up when a player is nearby.

Now, some people may say at first that this is OP because the wither skeleton might drop its skull. However, this isn't OP in fact. Why? 

Well, first of all, lightning striking on mobs is VERY rare, so getting wither heads in the Overworld is highly unlikely. 

Secondly, if a player somehow gets a skull from a wither skeleton spawned in the Overworld and only has stone tools, then the skull will be completely useless (except for decoration purposes) until he/she gets enchanted diamond armour and a god sword.

Not only that, but villages spawn in places that don't make sense for villages to actually be. So here are my proposed changes to villages.

Where they spawn: Villages are hard to find, and they spawn in places lacking a certain necessity. Water. So, as someone else has suggested (whose name I don't remember), they should only spawn near water sources. As in lakes, rivers, and oceans. However, they should also spawn in any biome, making them easier to find. And slightly more realistic.

Architecture: Village architecture is always the exact same. What's more, desert villages are basically just plains villages made of sandstone. So I propose this. When generated, villages preform their usual checks. However, after checking what biome the well is in, it picks from a list of types of architecture, what type of architecture the village has. Different biomes have different lists. However, the types of houses and their purposes remain the same.

Damage: The point of village helplessness is so that the player is either the villager's ""knight in diamond armor"" or the person who condemns them. So wouldn't it be cool if, when renovating the village, the player had to either fix or destroy damaged houses? What I mean by damaged houses is, when the village is generated, the houses are damaged. Roofs appear to be collapsed, windows are broken and boarded up, the paths might be deteriorated. Obviously there would be limits to this, so the entire village isn't destroyed when generated. I personally would enjoy having to fix up the village, and decide between fixing up the old boarded up shack, or just tearing it down.

Better roads, better houses: I'm sure we've all seen the villages in water, the houses with the bottom going far down into the ravine, or the gravel roads fallen into caves. So what I suggest is that when a house is on water, it is supported, above the water, by pontoons (logs). Roads become docks, and are made of wood, and also supported by logs. Also, when generated over a cave or ravine, house will just make supports that go to the bottom, instead of having the wall extend down to the bottom of the ravine. Finally, road that go over ravines should make bridges.

Villages have a tendency to spawn near each other: This would make sense. But also, think of all the things this could lead to. Merchants, village relationship, maybe even war (although villagers are currently peaceful). However, I don't want all that stuff yet, I just want villages to have a tendency to spawn near each other. As to how it could be done, maybe ""habitable areas"" randomly spawn near water sources. Villagers have a higher chance of spawning in these, so villages will often spawn near each other. There is one other thing it could lead too though....

Mixed architecture: As you read earlier, villages will spawn close together. I also proposed villages have special architecture. So maybe, when a village spawns near another, it has a chance of having mixed architecture, which combines multiple types of architecture. The types of architecture will always be that villages architecture, and the architecture of nearby villages.

Finally, village age: Village age is the first variable determined in village generation. It determines the size of the village, determines what kind of architecture it can have, how damaged the village will be, and the chance of it being a mixed village. Please note, this is talking about the age of the village already, before the player found it.

So what will this do? This makes villages feel more real, and more unique. It makes it more interesting for players to improve villages. Also, it encourages the player to be imaginative. They can see all the things and make up a history of the village, a much better alternative to just finding a book with the village history.",,False,,t5_2s3oo,False,,,True,t3_17jdft,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/17jdft/slightly_better_village_generation/,

Redstone increases the duration of a potion, Glowstone increases the magnitude (depending on the potion), and Gunpowder makes the potion throw-able giving it an area-of-effect dispersion. I humbly submit a new addition to that group:

**Lapis creates “Thick” potions that can be consumed multiple times in a single bottle at the cost of Magnitude and Duration**

***


 *Logical Explanation*

***

Just like you thicken a gravy with starch or a desert with heavy cream, Lapis would be a thickening agent that makes the potion denser, allowing the user to get multiple servings from a single bottle. I had originally considered Slime Balls for this mechanic, but Lapis is better because it is inorganic (fits the theme with Redstone and Glowstone dust) and has no mechanical uses (only aesthetic dye and decorative block uses). Whether this is realistic or not is up to you but this is how you can rationalize it from a logical perspective.

***

*Mechanics Details*

***

Creating a “Thick” potion is just like creating a “Splash” potion but you use Lapis instead of Gunpowder. So to craft a Thick Fire Resistance potion, I would brew a water bottle with Netherwart &gt; Magma Cream &gt; Lapis. Just like many other potion modifiers, the magnitude and duration may change to prevent abuse. For example, instead of having a potion I drink once that lasts say 4 mins, I have a potions I can drink 3 times that last a min each time consumed. It’s balanced by the fact that the total duration of each partial consumption (3 mins total) is shorter than the standard potion’s duration (4 mins). This is just a hypothetical example; exact durations, magnitudes, even number of uses can be adjusted to prevent abuse.

Tracking potion uses can be done one of two ways. Consumption of a potion reduces is durability just like a tool or weapon. When the durability runs out, you are left with an empty bottle. The second way is to do it with words like a Damaged Anvil. Put the prefix “slightly empty” or “mostly empty” in front of the potion description (would take the place of the “Thick” prefix). 

***

*Practical Applications*

***

Due to the inability to stack potions together in your inventory, having a single potion that you can use multiple times would be a space saving advantage and beneficial for many situations. Allow me to outline a few below:

* You have created a nether base. To keep players out, you have created a lava curtain that blocks your front door from physical entry. It takes a short amount of time to get through the curtain, so using a standard strength fire resistance potion is a waste because you only need the effect for a small amount of time. In this situation, a single fire resistance potion you can drink 3 times would be much better use of your resources and save 2 inventory slots at the same time.

* You’re at half-health from a recent creeper explosion. Another creeper is bound to be nearby. You can’t wait for regular regeneration but you don’t want to waste a whole instant-healing potion to restore your health. You use a thickened healing potion instead to restore a smaller amount of health but just enough so another creeper blast won’t kill you.

* You are in the process of navigating back to your house with a fresh load of diamonds in your inventory. You are on a PvP server though and a player jumps you at the mine entrance. You keep a single potion of strength for just such an occasion and consume it before trying to fight them. But instead of attacking you, the thief runs away intending to wait out the potions effects. Before you get back to your home, the strength is gone and the thief kills you at your front door. You only had space in your inventory for one potion and had it been a thick potion, it would have had multiple activations between the mine and your house.

***

*Conflicts with Stacking Potions*

***

I will admit this feature would be less useful if potions were ever made stackable. Partly because it’s no longer a space saving feature, but mainly because partial potions with different durability wouldn’t stack with the other potions. If stackable potions are added, then a watered-down feature where you can brew a single potion into 3 empty bottles to get shorter duration potions would make more sense than using Lapis.

However, some people say that potions aren’t made stackable not because of coding limitations or not being a high priority but because stacking potions would make them too powerful that taking up one slot per bottle is key to preserving that balance. If you accept this as the truth and the real issue, then my Lapis idea still stands because it preserves that balance and adds a new utility to the potion system.

***

*Conclusion*

***

Pros – 

* Saves inventory space

* Efficient for a variety of situations

* Gives a mechanical use for Lapis

* Fits existing game mechanics and conventions

Cons –

* Conflicts with adding stackable potions as a feature

* Debatable whether or not it makes the game more “fun” for a majority of players

* Adds a host of new potion ID’s to Minecraft (I’m under the impression that when the new Modding API is released this isn’t going to be a big deal. I’m not a programmer so I don’t know)

So you could put a stockpile of hay bales in your animal pens and they would eventually breed on their own.  The downside is that it takes much more wheat to breed them this way.

You build a shelter, gather materials, build a better home, rinse, repeat. This goes on until you basically have everything; a massive home complex, mob grinders, full, enchanted diamond gear, a surplus of materials. 

This may be fun for a while, but the challenge mobs provide quickly diminishes. One zombie is just as hard as the last one. Every day the monsters will be the same as yesterday, as a week ago, as world generation. 

---

Basically I am suggesting this simple addition; **A ""Progressive"" game mode, in which mobs get harder every day**. 

When you first are creating a world, there should be a new option among Survival, Creative, and Hardcore; ""Progressive"". It would be just like hardcore mode, but every day, the mobs will get ever so slightly stronger. 

Due to the way Minecraft health works, this won't be a small fragment each day, rather, it would be half a heart every X days. For instance, let's say X would be 10 days. For the first ten days, all mobs have normal health. But as time goes on, after 100 days, they have 5 hearts more health than when you began. Not much, but considering how long most worlds are played, this will eventually have a massive amount of health.

Not only will mobs have more health, but **mobs will also gain slightly higher attack** at the same rate. Every X days they do a half heart more damage, and have a half heart more health. For creepers (and ghasts), explosions become larger over time (at a slower rate than health/attack). Also, creeper charges slowly become shorter and shorter, until they literally explode upon the start of their fuse. Again, this is deep into the game - probably years of in-game days.

Among health and attack, **mobs get faster as well**. Zombies, skeletons, etc. all will eventually walk faster and faster, until one day you can't even outwalk them, and very far into the game, you won't even be able to outrun them and must think and plan very, very carefully. 

**Mobs see you from further away** as time goes on. Plan carefully, use cover frequently, stay hidden or out of range, and you just might stay alive.

And finally, **as time goes on, more mobs will spawn with gear/enchantments**. Eventually, most of the zombies you see will be decked out in full diamond -- Of course, this is years of in-game time down the road. Mobs with equal power to the player!


---


Now for some benefits that would come from this new game mode!

* Players would need to be more hasty when starting out    
* The challenge of the game will grow steadily, and be more fun
* Completely optional, just another game mode choice 
* Assigned per world; not changeable without mods
* Players need to think more before charging into battle
* Mobs provide that threat that SSP never gave
* Time and days are already saved, so this should be fairly easy to add
* Takes nothing away from the normal game, only adds new gameplay

This also includes village population being based off of beds.
_______________________

**The Problem:**


I'm trying to build up a large village on my server right now and I'm hitting all the standard problems anyone has faced when working on villages:

- Villagers tend to crowd into one building at night 
- This leads to distant buildings being completely abandoned
- Unattended buildings can be considered inactive and stop counting towards villager populate
- Need to have 3 doors per villager, leading to having to put doors everywhere and hide doors in other places


The list goes on but you guys get the point.  There are solutions for redistributing villagers, trying to get them to spread out, trapping them in buildings, hiding doors, etc etc but they all really screw with the aesthetic of the villlage.

**The Solution:**

Why not have Villagers be instead tied to a bed?  For each *valid* and available bed a villager can be spawned.  Once spawned a villager is tied to that bed.  Each night he will return to the proximity of his bed.

**Something I'd like you guys to weigh in on:**

What is a valid bed can be calculated many ways.  Currently valid door calculation seems to confuse anyone who hasn't done a good amount of research into it.  

The check for sunlight in front of and behind doors isn't something that would directly transfer to deciding if a bed is valid.  I feel like this is partially done to discourage villager farming (which we've seen Mojang has tried to fix further in 1.4).  My solution is instead the same check to see if a bed is safe to sleep in over night is done to consider if a bed is valid and once a bed is owned by a villager it is considered occupied well past when/if it's owner dies.

A huge upside to that solution is that sunlight would no longer restrict the creation of mountainside/underground villages.



Let me know what you guys think, as someone who loves working with our big nosed friends this would be a huge win for aesthetics, simplicity, and preventing abuse of the trade mechanics.

**Edit:** Added a blacksmith building and can't figure out how to get the villagers to stop crowding it without making it really ugly yet and this happened the very next night http://i.imgur.com/S1Pfz.png

**Edit2:** For the valid bed check that I am suggesting, I meant to use the ""safe bed"" check that used to be in beta which as the minecraft wiki states is:

Certain enemies would have advantages in finding targets. The Wither has three heads so it would be able to see more mobs. Spiders have spider vision, so they could see well even in the dark. Skeletons riding spiders would know about the mobs that the spider sees, as well. It doesn't make sense that they can sense people through walls, but we could still keep that. Wolves have a good sense of smell so they could sense foes from farther away. Endermen and the Ender Dragon could sense you through walls since otherwise their teleportation and block breaking powers would be a lot less effective. It wouldn't really matter because they're bats, but because of echolocation they could have 360 degree senses. Aquatic mobs like squids could see better underwater.

I did a crafting mockup real quick here (forgive my use of Paint): http://imgur.com/TXKJg

I know clay and cement aren't actually interchangeable, but given the existing materials in Minecraft I tried to come up with a way to make concrete.

I think that placing this with the bucket could make it flow (just not like water, maybe more like lava) and if it spreads out to its limits, it sets to slabs (height = 0.5 m) but if it is confined to a 1 m x 1 m space perhaps it makes a whole block (height = 0.5 m). This way you would have to ""form"" it like real concrete. The texture could be similar to the unused double stone slab texture (http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/e/e1/Newstoneslab.png). 

If you wanted to get really fancy, maybe you could use admixtures as well. After crafting your bucket-o-concrete, maybe on a crafting table you can add other things (e.g. redstone dust? glowstone dust? dyes?) that change the behavior of concrete. http://imgur.com/1AtoH Perhaps a redstone admixture makes the block conduct a redstone signal. Maybe dyes color it. Maybe glowstone makes it glow faintly. The possibilities for admixtures are endless!

Well I personally thought it'd be cooler to have actual seahorses so I made this suggestion, and it eventually grew into an entire post about what I'd like to see for the new update!*
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

***MOBS AND ENTITIES***
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

**Seahorses:** So the seahorses would look like [this](http://imgur.com/gcRhFUj). And this is the [seadragon](http://imgur.com/wF8Jp9X), a variation of the seahorse (kinda like how donkeys are a variation of horses.

As you can see they are rideable. They have to be tamed, like horses and come in different varieties, like horses. They would be found in a new biome that called ""seaweed forest."" It's pretty much a biome on the ocean floor, made up of seaweed. This is [the seaweed forest biome](http://i.imgur.com/WgP6Q31) Seahorses can take you underwater at greater speeds than just sinking to the bottom so if sunken ships are ever implimented (I've seen a lot of posts about sunken ships), the seahorses can take you down faster. 

**Sharks and dolphins:** Everything is explained [here](http://imgur.com/GjuEsYc) 

**Fish:** The [fish](http://imgur.com/alLuUf7) I came up with was based off the raw fish item. It will drop raw fish as usual, with the addition of a rare fish egg drop. The fish egg will allow you to spawn fish in water. They are not tame, they do not fight. They make for a great fish tank though :)

**Leviathan:**
So I decided to make up an aquatic boss mob that I would like to see in Minecraft. The Leviathan. Of course lots of people would like to see a Kraken, but it's just a suggestion and I figured a giant sea serpent would be badass instead of the usual giant squid. Anyways here is the [image](http://imgur.com/h7WqaNF) It's an unfinished idea as I have no idea what the reward would be for killing it and I have no idea what the underwater temple should look like. I DO know that if ships are ever implemented, they would be perfect for taking this thing on! Another thing I forgot to mention is that it will continue to rain until the Leviathan is dead. Yes the Leviathan will chase you in boats and on seahorses, and yes it will hunt you down incessantly once you touch the water. I'm guessing this boss has to be created or summoned like the Wither. Maybe ringing a special unbreakable bell in the underwater temple? Hmm...I like that actually...and then you'd hear a roar and it'd be best if you got the fuck out of there quick before that shit cornered you! Well, what do you guys think?

**Ships:**
I think ships would be a pretty cool mode of transportation. It allows players to stick together on long overseas adventures, and it can carry cargo! It's pretty big, so it'd be slower than a regular boat (but not terribly slow). I made a [mock up](http://imgur.com/a/b5y8o). They are entities so they have health (150 health points). While controlling the ship, the navigator can right click to fire cannons (represented by the window panes on the lower part of the ship) on the right, and left click to fire the cannons on the left side (there will be a cool down time of 1 minute). Cannons deal 15 hearts of health and explode upon contact with entities or blocks (any stray cannonballs that hit the land will cause an explosion and damage the terrain). The navigator uses W to move forward, A to TURN the ship left and D to TURN the ship right (no strafing ships). S slows ships down as ships cannot move backwards. If two ships are close enough, players can jump aboard and try to take the other ship. When a ship is depleted of health, it begins to sink. Players are dropped into the water and anything in the chests of the ships is lost. You cannot build on ships.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
***STRUCTURES***
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

**Sunken Ships:** 
So I made a quick mock up of [sunken ships](http://imgur.com/a/zEhF8). So the sunken ship is pretty much a regular ship, with no doors, windows, or masts, with a big hole blown into the side with TNT (at least that's how I built it :P). There are two chests. One in the captain's cabin and one belowdecks. The one in the captain's cabin has a Captain's Log item. The one belowdecks has random loot. Coral and seaweed spawn around it as you can see, but the amount of coral and seaweed should vary between ships. Also sharks could spawn more abundantly near these shipwrecks (maybe a shipwreck could be it's own biome to make only sharks spawn here?). 

**Underwater Temples:** The [underwater temple](http://imgur.com/a/gNo56) is kind of a rare structure. In the underwater temple is a bell that, when rung, summons the Leviathan.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
***BLOCKS***
______________________________________________________________________________________________

[**Coral:**](http://imgur.com/a/JYdxQ) It's coral. It breaks as easily as glass. It gives off light (but only underwater). It's basically the glowstone of the sea. It comes in many bright colors (but I felt like only doing pink). It should definitely be more detailed then what I did. It grows in random clusters like glowstone, and it can be found on sunken ships and underwater temples. It is also found in a biome called a coral reef. Pretty much it's a biome filled with clusters of coral formations of different colors. Fish spawn more in this biome than just in the open ocean (of course with the amount of ocean in the game, it isn't very significant).

[**Seaweed:**](http://imgur.com/5r53Y4y) Seaweed grows up to 5 blocks in height. Seaweed is found in seaweed forests (and around sunken ships or underwater temples). Seaweed slows you down a bit as you can get tangled in seaweed IRL. Seaweed forest biomes are where seahorses are found.

[**Bell:**](http://imgur.com/TJjq5lq) The bell is only found in underwater temples. It is unbreakable. When rung, it spawns a Leviathan nearby. It should look more worn down, instead of shiny like I did it.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
***ITEMS***
______________________________________________________________________________________________

**Spyglass:**
So I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1isiql/telescope/), and wanted to include telescopes in my post. This is the [spyglass](http://imgur.com/a/bwkGC), and it is crafted like [this](http://imgur.com/OBBjffY) When used they cause a blur (similar to the pumpkin blur) in the shape of the opening of the spyglass. It also increases FOV (the same amount as the slowness effect at level 255), causing everything you can see to appear enlarged. It is used by right clicking, and when you right click again the player puts it down. It is held like a [bow](http://imgur.com/a/45pOY). One more [image](http://imgur.com/JsK1S6v).

**Captain's Log:** It is a written book titled, [""Captain's Log""](http://imgur.com/L91KURA) signed by [insert random name]. I was thinking that maybe there could be a text file with a bunch of different sentences and phrases and stuff like that, and the Captain's Log pretty much takes the sentences, mixes 'em together (in a way that makes sense of course), and leaves a nice little story detailing events on the ship, such as how a crew member tried mutiny, or maybe saying the food supply was running low, or even the cause of why the ship sunk in the first place. There would be a separate text file to create random names of the captains.

Maybe, if fire is underneath it, it gives off a large amount of smoke that ascends strait up, sort of like a beacon, but spreads a little bit to the sides as it goes. It could be used for smoke signals, and maybe even some more redstone mechanics, possibly triggering certain redstone blocks. Also, maybe this smoke can suffocate you, and when it hits a block above, it goes to all sides slowly, and starts falling back down, filling up a room. What do you think?

How the hell does this make sense? We have heavy, cast iron anvils that can easily squash an unassuming mob/player, but our heavy, cast iron minecarts (that race along rails at ridiculous speeds) can't do anything more than bounce off a mob/player sitting in the middle of the tracks.

My idea is that mobs and players recieve damage from oncoming minecarts, depending on how fast the minecart is going. This means that simply pushing a minecart will deal no damage, while a minecart could instantly kill you if it has enough speed. Minecarts would be immune to this type of damage, due to the fact that the game considers minecarts to be mobs. My idea for a damage formula would be...

Minecart speed (blocks per second, rounded to nearest whole number)
             X
One and a half hearts of damage
              =
Damage done to the player
(Minecraft wiki states that mincarts have a max speed of 8 blocks per second, which would make the damage cap 12 hearts)

Does anyone have any ideas/criticisms? Should minecart damage be affected by armor? Please post a comment if you have any thoughts about the idea.

(player) Ran over (player)

(player) Forgot to stay off the tracks

What I suggest: Reintroduce the rainfall/temperature-algorithm into the biome code.

**WARNING: This does get quite technical at times. To my knowledge, most of the issues that Mojang are facing implementing stuff like mountains are simply how to implement them. Hear me out before downvoting please.**
##Introduction

I am not a fan of the current biome generation system. It's cool, yes, but it is not being used to its full potential.

##Current Issues:

- Deserts and jungles generate next to ice biomes.

- Biomes themselves are monotonous and mostly feel the same. Taigas are always hilly and at a certain height, for example. Biome features that are larger than the biomes themselves cannot be generated with the current system.

&gt;Right now I think the reason biomes are boring is because they are clearly defined and internally very uniform. If you've seen one desert or ocean or forest you've seen them all.

(⇧ thanks **BlueRavenGT** ⇧)

- The current system is unable to generate decent looking mountains.

**The current system:**

Biomes are decided according to a *biome ID* that is assigned to each column (also known as an (X, Z) coordinate) of blocks in a world. If you were looking at a map, each square in the map would have a biome ID. This biome ID is a number that corresponds to the biome that is generated at that location - for example biome 2 is plains.

##Possible ideas:

1. Overhaul every single biome like jungles are currently. This means adding new trees, new variations of trees, new mobs and new plants. I know this is probably suggested way too much, but frogs and alligators would be perfectly at home in swamps; birds would add huge atmosphere to forests. 

2. Decouple biome height from biome generation. Currently, each biome has a specific height above sea level that is assigned to it. Deserts generate ~12 blocks above sea level, and plains generate ~19 blocks above sea level. If this was removed or altered (for example, using a ""terrain ID"" - that is not stored in a block, and is separate from the biome ID: hilly, flat, highlands, lowlands, rivers (see below), extreme hills, canyons, and mountains (see below)), terrain features that are larger than the biomes themselves could be implemented, such as rivers, canyons, highlands, flatlands and mountains. Leading up to the first real suggestion...

##Mountains:

I will describe this as a series of steps for how to generate a mountain. I will add images later.

**How to generate an interesting mountain:**

1. Choose a *mountain summit* - a (X, Z) coordinate, or column, that represents where the top of the mountain will be. This is similar to the village generator, which starts with a village center, which is where the well is generated. 

2. Choose how large the mountain is (radius), whether it is a volcano and any other factors which may affect generation.

3. Generate 3-5 *spurs* from the mountain summit. Mountains are not perfectly conical, and I don't think perfectly conical mountains look very nice. Spurs are simply the ridges that run down the side of a mountain. Just to be clear, the mountain itself isn't being generated yet - the summit and the line/path that the spurs will follow are simply being created. The current river algorithm can be combined with the village road algorithm to create decent spurs. Optionally, the spurs can be connected to other nearby mountains. **This may be unclear - post a comment if you have a question!**.

4. Generate (some) rivers between the spurs. Between the spurs in a mountain are draws, or valleys. Generally, at the lowest point in a valley, a river will be found, but not always.

5. Generate a *heightmap* for the mountain. A heightmap is simply a map which assigns each column a height.

6. Incorporate the heightmap into the Minecraft world. A simple way to do this is to simply move all terrain upward according to the heightmap, before cave generation and after ore generation. A more complex way to do this would be to move all terrain upward, but reduce the influence of the original terrain the closer it is to the summit. Rivers and lava streams can be added at this stage.

7. Replace all biomes above a certain height (~112, but feathered and random) with mountain biomes. This value will represent the treeline.

**Old explanation, may be confusing but offers a huge technical insight:**

Mountains! Not just any mountains. How can these be implemented? Sadly, not using standard biomes. I've messed around with TerrainControl (a mod that allows creation of custom biomes) and it is impossible. However, another system can be used. Villages use a *village center* to tell the generator where to generate the village and where to spawn iron golems. This village center is can be found exactly where the village well is. Mountains should have a similar approach, with a *mountain summit* and a *size* where all terrain is moved up according to a generated mountain pattern. This happens before cave generation or ore generation. The mountain area will have its own biome category (see below) and will have fringe biomes (see below) with whatever is surrounding it, and the mountain will generate with spurs and valleys, and perhaps a volcano with a dungeon inside it. The edges of a mountain can be composed of a huge amount of biomes, which will all blend into mountain biomes the closer they get to the summit.

##Biome variants:

*The point of this is to increase the variation that biomes display (and reduce the associated boredom), while still keeping a decent level of realism. The rules do state that fun overrules realism, but the system would be a lot more messy if all of the following biomes were just added into the system to spawn randomly next to any of the other biomes on the list, as with the current generation system. Categorizing the biomes allows the game to have many, many more biomes without it becoming a total mess.*

**Biome variants**, or *sub-biomes*. Each biome will have several variants that have the same temperature and humidity. Simply, every biome in each category will generally be found close to each other. Some of these biome variants can be extremely rare, while some will be more common.

**If this is unclear to you, think of each category as like a country (like the USA). Each country has states (e.g. Texas) - these are the biome variants described below.** The fringes would be like the borders, except they are very thick borders.

Example:

**Temperate (forest and grassland)**: standard forest, birch forest, mixed (pine + oak) forest, pine forest, dense forest (with more trees), sparse forest (with less trees), redwood forest, magical forest, **corrupted forest** with traces of dark magic (think of the eldritch ruins in Thaumcraft 2) with more endermen and corrupted mobs, temperate swamp, poplar forest, and any more forests which involve slightly different tree species; plains, plains with some oak trees, plains with different types of grass, plains with pine and oak trees. Temperate beach.

**Desert**: desert, desert with trees, dunes (without cactus/dead shrubs), savanna (with acacia trees), savanna (without acacia trees), Grand Canyon style desert with hardened clay/similar block, sandstone desert, desert with dead trees, desert with palm trees, desert with tree clusters, desert with clusters of evergreen trees (think Afghanistan, which has snow in the winter and extremely hot desert summers), badlands. Desert beach.

**Tropical (forest and plains)**: jungle, swamp, tropical savanna, jungle with straight trees, jungle with thin trees only, jungle with twisted/tilted trees, jungle with huge trees, jungle with a huge canopy which does not let sunlight through (the sky is GREEN!... but not really), tropical forest, swamp with twisted trees, mangrove, giant mushroom jungle, wetlands, Everglades style wetlands with sawgrass. Tropical beach with banana trees, tropical beach. Don't forget mosquito repellent.

**Arctic/Icezone**: ice plains (Tundra), deep ice plains (with several layers of snow), taiga (pine forest with snow), ice plains with dead trees, ice forest with dead oak trees, ice ""jungle"" with huge, twisted trees, ice jungle (think of the ice sphere in Crysis), redwoods, magical ice forests, ice ""swamp"" with huge, twisted trees. Arctic beach, arctic beach without sand, arctic beach with ice.

**Nether**: there are over 9000 ideas for nether biomes, but... netherrack caves/mountains (basically what is in the nether currently), soul sand caves/flats, nether forests? (some otherworldly plant that may or may not look like a tree will have to be added for this), nether wart gardens, perhaps different styled caves with different nether blocks. And perhaps a special one that generates in a 8-10 block wide splatter pattern around nether portals, covered in grass and flowers. The Nether really must be expanded, the whole place looks the same. 

**River**: river, wide river, fast river, rapids, completely frozen river, river with ice on edges, river with floating tree logs, stream, creek, huge river, shallow slow river, U-shaped lowlands river, V shaped highlands river, river with arch/covering (""cave""/tunnel river), river with island/sandbar in the center, sand river, rock river, gravel river, waterfall, tropical mud river with mossy stone, dirt river, river mouth at ocean. Gravel riverbank, sand riverbank, grass riverbank.

**Mountain** (found on mountain areas): rocky (stone and gravel, with a few patches of grass/tall grass), arid rocky (same but with dead shrubs and sand instead), rocky grassland (grass with rocks/boulders jutting out), rocky forest (grass with rocks jutting out, and small clusters of trees), mountain forest (mountainside with rocks jutting out and dense forests), mountain jungle (mountainside with rocks jutting out and dense jungle), mountain ice forest (mountainside with rocks jutting out and ice forests, generally higher up the mountain as higher equals colder).

**Volcanic** (found on volcano areas): all of **Mountain** plus: volcanic plain (""plains"" made of black volcanic rock, no grass or anything; with or without snow), lava islands (islands with lava ""rivers"" between them). Chasms with running lava would also fit. Basically, when a volcano is generated, lava ""rivers"" will also be generated, and anywhere near or on top of them will be volcanic-type biomes.

**Fringe** biomes would simply be a mixture between each biome's properties. For example, if one biome had a temperature of 0.8 (0-1, 1 being highest) and another had a temperature of 0.5, the fringe would have the mean (average), which is 0.65. A more complex system calls for a linear blend between these features between categories. Fringes are between categories (e.g. Arctic and Forest), but can also be between biomes within a category too. Larger differences in temperatures/humidities result in larger fringes.

**Weather** will be detailed in a further suggestion. The relevant point that will be described here is that it should no longer be tied to the biome, but instead should be tied to the temperature. A fringe between an arctic and a forest category will have snow starting somewhere in the middle, for example, and dependent upon season.

Another group of horsemen ride in from a nearby fortress. The plain is deathly silent. Suddenly, cries break out from both sides, and the thundering of hooves fills the air. Players ride forth, their lances in front of them, eager for battle.

To accompany this new horse mob, I suggest that wooden and iron lances be added. They would be crafted like regular swords, but the materials would be laid down in a diagonal across the crafting table.

The lances would make jabbing motions when left clicked. A wooden lance used to knock another player on a horse would deal one heart of damage, eject them from their saddle, and cause their horse to dash for a few seconds. Iron lances would also knock players off and do knockback like wooden ones, but they would deal as much damage as an iron sword. 

Right clicking the lances could have some kind of galloping effect on the horse like a carrot on a stick, but until we learn of the riding mechanics, this will have to wait.

Lances could be enchanted with a different set of enchantments, or the same ones as swords, I'm not sure yet.",,False,,t5_2s3oo,1365137898.0,,,True,t3_1bprbn,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1bprbn/lances_in_response_to_the_horses_that_jeb_has/,

What I'd like to see is a new enchantment - ""petrification"".

This would only be usable on swords. If you kill a mob (any mob) with a sword of petrification, it will freeze and change appearance/skin to look like smooth stone (whatever that looks like in your current texture pack).

If you use a pick or other tool to try to break the statue, it would be completely destroyed. If you use silk touch however, you would get a placeable statue item so you could take that statue and put it anywhere you like.

I don't think this would be appropriate to use on players. All other mobs, though, should be fine.

Want to move a village of testificates? No problem! On the way to the new location, you can even take them out and play chess with the little buggers. (OK - not really, but the idea amuses me to no end)

One further twist - this would open the door for a new potion, ""de-petrification"" or maybe ""melting"", which would only be useful in splash potion format and which would reverse the petrification effect.

When a villager is spawned by breeding(not eggs), they also spawn with a puppy or kitten that follows it round. They'd pretty much behave like normal: ocelots scare creepers away and wolves kill mobs that attack its owner. I'm more interested in wolves seeing as how they can actually defend their owner, but ocelots would be okay as well.

Killing them could cause the village to dislike you more, like iron golems do now. I'm not entirely sure what should happen if the owner dies though.

**Upon owner death**

They could either:

-1: Become normal wild wolves/ocelots like usual.

-2: Stay tamed forever and either wander the village or stay in the place where their owner died(as if waiting for them to come back)

-3: Be tamed by the nearest villager within a radius. 

-4: Wolves could become 'feral', and they would attack any hostile mobs and nearby players until they despawn, as if enraged by their owner's death. This would also keep the pet population in check with the village population as the pets despawn with their owners.

Failing the third option they could do one of the others in order to make sure they do something. I'm not a huge fan of the first option because it could be used to farm wolves/ocelots to an extent, but that's just my opinion. I'd also like to hear any other possibilities not listed that I may have forgotten.

**Additional ideas for ambiance**

*Have butchers give a bit of meat to village wolves/ocelots nearby. It won't cause them to breed, but will heal them slightly. Golems sort of already do this with roses to children(minus healing), so I would think it's possible. It would only apply to village animals to prevent misuse.

*Have village children make the wolf/ocelot 'sit' for a few seconds, then reward with a treat like a bone/fish. I was going to suggest petting but that's a bit much imo. The animation would also most likely look pretty dumb anyways.

**Reason for adding**

It would give some ambiance to villages. It doesn't make a lot of sense why they wouldn't have domesticated animals, as real world cultures have been doing it for hundreds if not thousands of years.  It also provides a little bit more defense to villages if they have a wolf/ocelot to keep mobs away. I could see if wolves/ocelots might have been intended to be player only, but the option is there. I haven't seen a suggestion like this before and apologize if it's already been suggested.


**Ease of adding**

Not entirely sure how feasible it is from a coding standpoint because I'm not sure how wolves store their owner data, but I don't think it would be too hard if a lot of the infrastructure is there.

So I'll keep this short and sweet. This can only be done on creative. To do this, you must right click a villager of your choice, you then will see their regular trading interface, then click a button that says ""Edit Trade"" When you do this, it'll open up the items the villager wants and the items it will give. You can then remove the items it currently says, and replace them with the ones you want it to be. (e.g. So a villager trading thing says Emerald for wheat. when you edit it, you can remove the emerald and wheat selection, and change it into...maybe an enchanted chestplate, a golden apple, and a chicken egg for a diamond) . You could also make it so that you can't trade with some villagers (their trading interface will be empty) by removing all items they have on their trading interface, because this interferes with some maps, because if a player has a certain item, they could go up to a random villager, and essentially cheat to get a certain item (if that's what they want). I am certain this can be done with an NBT, but not everyone has/wants/can get an NBT, so if this was in creative, it'd be MUCH simpler.

The **Ender Book** would be created by combining a Book &amp; Quill with an Eye of Ender. It would function similar to a normal book, letting people write in them and read them, but with a few *very* important differences.

**1)** Players can edit Ender Books that they themselves signed whenever they want. Unlike normal books the text isn't set in place, you can open up the book again later and edit as you please. You cannot edit an Ender Book written by someone else though you can still read it normally.

**2)** All Ender Books by the same player share the same exact text and title. If you edit one Ender Book, all Ender Books you've signed also change. That means you can hand out Ender Books to all your friends, then alter the text in those books at a later point without having to get them back.

This would have a huge variety of uses. Your Ender Book can serve as a mail system or message board. You can leave messages for your friends like ""Tom, please bring coal to the castle"" or ""I won't be back until next Thursday"". It can also serve as an in game profile or on roleplaying servers as a character background. You can write who you are, what you're doing, and so on. Server admins can give out copies of their own books to make official announcements and to list server rules. Really the uses for communication are endless.

And it's useful in single player too. Since it can be edited you can use it as an in game notepad, writing messages for yourself and then deleting them later when you don't need that information anymore. No need to waste a new book &amp; quill on every minor thing you want to jot down.

The information also persists across death, even if all Ender Books are destroyed. So if you find a cool nether fortress and write down the map coordinates, and then fall into lava, you can craft a new Ender Book after you respawn and the information will still be there. 

Normal books would still be useful though. If you want to write down more information than can fit in one tome you'd need normal books too.",,False,,t5_2s3oo,1364777671.0,,,True,t3_1bdmn0,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1bdmn0/ender_books/,

At night the designated villager will seek shelter as usual, but come daytime again they will remember this location and attempt to return to it. 

The designator could be constructed by assembling the items required for that profession (for instance a  blacksmith might require anvil, a bucket of lava and work-bench, etc). This would create a designator object (maybe just a sign or an actual work area ie: pulpit for a priest, desk for a librarian, box of produce for a farmer).

Here they are.

**BOW:**

**Pierce (I):** arrows would pierce through multiple mobs, and if an arrow were to hit a mob and then hit a block it would despawn, like normal arrows.

**Quick Draw (I):** this would reduce the amount of time it takes to charge a bow by 20%.

**Multi Shot (I, II, III):** Bow would fire multiple shots, but still only use one arrow. Only one of the arrows would be able to be picked back up, unless a mob is hit. Level would increase amount of arrows per shot (I = 2 arrows, II = 3 arrows, etc.). Arrows would spread further apart the further they travel. Enchantment would not be able to be combined with Power or Infinity.

**SWORD:**

**Consume (I):** depending on your swords strength, it would take half of a hit's damage and add that many points to your hunger. Maybe it could happen by chance to reduce it being over powered. Can't be combined with Smite or Bane of Arthropods.

**Final Cut (I):** Working title. This enchantment would make the swords strikes more powerful the lower your health is. Maybe every 2 hp points gone would equal 1 damage point extra. So 8 hearts would mean 1 heart extra damage, and 2 hearts would mean 4 hearts extra damage. Would not be able to be combine with Smite, Bane of Arthropods, and possibly Sharpness.

**Guard (I, II):** Would increase the protection of blocking, Guard I would give +15% resistance, and Guard II would give you +35%. Could not be combined with knockback.

**ARMOR:**

**Resistance (I, II):** would basically be unbreaking for armor, could not be combined with Aqua Affinity, Respiration, or Feather Falling.

**Rebound (I):** Occasionally a strike would rebound and do the damage that you would have taken to the attacker. Would not work with projectiles. Would not be able to be combined with Protection, but it could with Fire Protection, Blast Protection, etc.

**TOOLS:**

**Brand (I):** would drop the smelted form of the material, would not give you smooth stone though. Could not be combined with Silk Touch or Fortune. Might need to only work on picks, otherwise you could get glass from sand, charcoal from logs, and bricks from clay blocks.

Obsidian tiles. Obsidian is a material with a lot of potential in minecraft, however it's used almost exclusively for nether portals and making enchanting tables.

Here's some textures i created of what Obsidian tiles might look like. (shown at default 16x, with magnified versions at 64x and 256x) I've made 3 different possible styles using the default obsidian texture as my pallet.

[Image of 3 possible texture for obsidian tiles, at default 16x and magnified for detail](http://i.imgur.com/8AmGQ.png)

^(Note: I give permission to mojang to freely use the textures i made should they implement my idea and want to save a bit of time making the texture.)


**Now, what are obsidian tiles?**

Tiles made of obsidian of course. The have many desirable qualities, such as stretching your obsidian supply, being an excellent decorative block, and could have quite a few uses to the clever redstone builders out there.

**How does one acquire obsidian tiles?**

Craft them. The pattern would be simple. Put a single block (or stack) of obsidian on the crafting grid, anywhere, and it will result in 4 blocks of obsidian tile. Exactly like turning logs into planks.

**Won't the ability to multiply your obsidian like that unbalance the game?**

Not at all. While there are many advantages to obsidian tiles, they have some disadvantages over obsidian blocks. Below is a list of pros and cons. (note: some traits could be seen as both, and are marked with an asterisk)

Not to mention the fact that obsidian is not by any means a rare material, and is quite easy to manufacture in large amounts by pouring water near a pool of lava. It's simply frustrating to mine in large amounts, but by no mean difficult. 

**Pros:**

* They will multiply your obsidian supply for the purpose of building.

* Finally a black construction block, for dark themed builds!

* They're are just as resistant to explosions as obsidian blocks.

* They can be crafted into slabs or stairs.

* They are more refined looking, and have excellent decorative qualities.

* They can be mined much faster than obsidian blocks. (lets say... 2-3 seconds with a diamond pickaxe?)*1

* Unlike obsidian blocks, obsidian tile blocks can be moved by pistons.*2

* It would basically make obsidian a legitimate building material.

**Cons:**

* They won't work for building nether portals

* They can't be used to make enchanting tables

* They can be mined much faster than obsidian blocks. (lets say... 2-3 seconds with a diamond pickaxe?)*1

* Unlike obsidian blocks, obsidian tile blocks can be moved by pistons.*2

* A diamond pickaxe is still required to mine them in survivial mode.


^(*1 Being that they can be mined much faster, using them in place of obsidian blocks as security measures on multiplayer servers would not work as well. although it will still take a while to break it without a diamond pickaxe)

^(*2 Though this would allow you to make things such as sealable cannons, and creeper proof hidden doors, the fact that obsidian tiles can be moved by pistons would potentially allow for abuse on servers... if you want an immovable block, stick with proper obsidian.)


**How would this look ingame?**

[I've tried it out actually, and it looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/M0g99.png)

^(note: this shows 3 possible patterns, only one would be used. most likely the small squares as that's been the most popular one, and would be the most suitable for stairs and slabs)

If you would like to try this out in action, if you still have the 1.3.2 version of minecraft around somewhere, a modder was nice enough to make my suggestion into a mod a while a back, but he has since retired, so this mod is no longer supported. ^(yes, i am reposting my own suggestion here from somewhere else as it seems more likely that mojang will see it here)

Mushrooms, lily pads, vines, trees, and lots of flat space to build and hunt. You were *lucky* if you found a Swamp.

But then everything changed when the Slime Nation attacked. Every night, the overwhelming noise of ""Shlick, shluck, squip, shqup"" fills the air, and makes it impossible to keep your sanity.

That means you've got about 16 little slimes schlurping all at once, and if you're unlucky enough to be in water, there's no mercy.

Here's my ideas:

* Make Slimes quieter

* Put a limit on how many can make noises at once (Preferably ""2"")

* Take away their stepping noises alltogether and just add idle noises, like Zombies and Skeletons and stuff.

* Make them hurt by water, like Endermen. This will at least stop them from making the horrible sound nonstop when they fall in, and also makes more sense than them *not* getting hurt by water. (Get it? Because it's washing away the slime?)

* Or, just make them a rare spawn, like Endermen or colored Sheep. That way it makes Slimeballs harder to get, too.

http://i.imgur.com/NfJLS.png

So basically what you have is a [key] item, and a [keyhole block]. When you place the [key] into the [keyhole block] (much like when you place a music disc into a music box) the [keyhole block] becomes powered, therefore sending a redstone signal to adjacent blocks, like doors, pistons or a redstone repeater to extend the signal to make even greater uses of it.

Thing is, this mechanic is HALF IMPLEMENTED in the game already!!! All you have to do is reskin a music disk into a key, reskin the music box into a keyhole block, make it so that when the key is in the block the block becomes powered as if it was receiving a redstone signal (wich is already a mechanic of the game) and bam! You have a sexy key mechanic so we can make a zelda/doom style dungeon, inovative puzzles, and much more!

* [UPDATE #1 - PADLOCKS]

* Due to user input (keep them coming, praise or criticism) I made an extension to the original idea, namely padlocks. keep in mind that although it is a great idea, Iam not sure if the implementation of padlocks is easy as the keyhole block. So take it as an added bonus, but the bulk of the suggestion remains as keys and keyhole blocks only.

The reason why is because even though it blocks 50% of damage, it slows you down and knocks you back. You only lose half health, but you lose ground, and that's not worth it.

So my suggestion is that when anyone attacks you in melee, be it a mob or player, and you're parrying, they get knocked back as if hit by knockback I. This would make parrying useful because then they're the ones losing ground if they attack while you're defending, and would bring a new element to sword combat.

Also, if a person with an axe hits someone who's parrying, the axe wielder won't be knocked back. This happens because axes are heavier and will ""break"" the person's parry.

* Fish
* Bones
* Obsidian
* Redstone Repeaters
* Diamonds
* Mooshroom, Chicken or Sheep Spawn Eggs (Again, doubtful)

* *Buy:*
* Gold
* Seeds
* Eggs
* Potatoes
* Gunpowder
* Cake

**Thieves**

* Gangs of wandering, hostile NPC's.
* Spawn in the same biomes as caravans, will attack caravans on sight
* Can spawn during day or night

* *When Killed, May Drop:*
* XP
* Glass
* Leggings (Rare)

But what if something HAS been cooked already? It is tedious having to check every furnace in a big furnace room just in case something is in it.

SOLUTION: A simple ""not empty"" visible texture indicator would save time when you have multiple furnaces in a room. This way you don't need to check them all (or have a great memory) to retrieve your already-cooked items quickly.

One new oven front texture would do the job (""furnace_front_full"")- a simple generic red blob (like warm metal) or possibly a grey blob (like a shadow) visible inside the front to show the oven has items in it. 

This would only require a quick adjustment to the oven textures and probably only a few lines of code; easy and makes the cooking process go a little more smoothly. 

Maybe it might be necessary to also make a ""furnace_front_lit_but_empty"" texture as well, in case objects are removed while the fire still burns.

CLARIFICATION: I am NOT suggesting we have a new oven texture for each kind of item that could be put inside. Just one additional, basic ""not-empty-looking"" front texture. And maybe a ""furnace_front_lit_but_empty"" texture as well.

CLARIFICATION: I am NOT suggesting we have different textures to show HOW full an oven is.

* When you start a new world the normal hard/easy/normal/peaceful button is there, under it you can find the advanced button, when you press it you would be taken to the difficulty pages/page.

* First you can find all separate things that are changed by difficulty. (hunger/firespread/mobs) You can then choose what difficulty you want each one to be at, maybe mobs=hard and hunger=peaceful.

* If you scroll down/go to the next page you will find an even more advanced page, here you coud choose more in depth what will happen, you coud choose: how many percent of hostile mobs are a specific kind and how many of the spiders/skeletons that are jockeys (There woud be a box with a number you could change) You could also choose more widely how how some things work, firespread can be set to never happen, hunger can be set to be fast enough to kill you before the night starts, fall damage can be set to be deadly from as low as 2 blocks.

More important is how they behave differently: 

1. **Goods within these chests are generated at the point when the player first opens them**. In other words, new items such as nametags and horse armour could appear in an old and nearby but newly discovered dungeon. The key advantage is that players would not necessarily have to explore to new chunks to find new items - they would just have to better explore old areas.

2. **These chests fall apart after they have been looted**. The chests themselves cannot be collected as they are so old. Instead, they drop sticks and planks, like boats do when destroyed.

Lighting a coal block on fire makes the coal block hot. The texture can possibly change to have red, glowing highlights and smoke particles rise when it is in this state. It stays hot for about 15-20 minutes and then reverts to the regular coal block.

When hot, it gives off a light level similar to the light level given off by activated redstone ore. Other things that can make it hot include fire charges, lava sources, and even lightning strikes. An automated way to set coal on fire can be through the use of dispensers.

The only way to extinguish coal blocks would be to pour water on it. This creates a plume of excess smoke particles and the ""sizzle"" sound, then it resets to the normal coal texture.

Lastly, walking on hot coals results in fire damage, however it is slower to kill than regular fire. It also does not destroy items.

**Now for the practical applications**

This would be very useful as it introduces a way to kill mobs through fire damage without destroying items. It also gives a way to create smoke particles for aesthetics. *Finally/hopefully, a way to make reliable smoking chimneys.*

A lot of these ideas assume a spawner would work even if it's buried.

**Zombie** - Graveyard

Would be a fenced in area with gravestones. If you dig underneath the graves there's a zombie spawner and a small chest with random low level items. Maybe 1 or 2 gravestones have this per graveyard.

**Skeleton** - Crypt

As an extension of the graveyard, there could be a crypt/mausoleum at the end of it which leads to a small dungeon with a sarcophagus at the end. If you break the stone, inside will be a small chest with slightly better goodies and a skeleton spawner.

**Spider** - Spiders Nest

Ideally these would be a small cave inside a hill with lots of cobwebs and a spider spawner. A chest or two with low level goodies.

**Creeper** - Creeper Nest

You can see the various suggestions I think people have made for this which I think are better than anything I can come up with. Have a search around /r/minecraft

**Endermen** - Already done (the end)

Most nether mobs make sense having random spawns, except maybe...

**Zombie Pigmen** - They really don't fit in the nether honestly, but perhaps a small village made of nether materials with a spawner / chest of gold goodies would make sense. Perhaps a pig statue as their idol.


Thoughts? Ideas? I'd love to hear them.

EDIT: Couple more ideas for passive mobs

**Wolves** - Wolf Den

A cave that wolves will spawn in higher frequency near. If you enter, the nearby wolves instantly become aggressive. Inside would be meats and other passive mob drops as well as some bones.

**Sqids** - Nest

A cave underwater that only spawns in ocean biomes. Squids spawn in higher frequency nearbye and inside could be 1 or 2 emerald veins (to give us reason to explore oceans?)

I love many of the new additions in 1.4. Unfortunately, there are some severe balancing issues that take what could be a perfectly tuned multiplayer experience into a little bit of a headache. I will address these issues and try to provide reasonable solutions for them.

**Enchanting**

The functionality of the Enchanting system is great. Spending EXP for enchants that are randomly generated is fun and I would not change that. Making enchanting easier or more customizable is not needed, this aspect of the system is already functioning perfectly. The main problem is with the actual enchant effects and the complete dismissal of balancing. I will explain my heartburn for both armor and weapon enchants and then provide what I consider to be reasonable solutions.

**What is wrong with armor enchants?**

There is one enchant that far surpasses all others, Protection(all). It is literally every other possible enchantment combined, and then some. This breaks balancing by making protection IV the best and most useful enchant, and it also takes all the fun of specialization right out of the game. 

I would never wear fire protection gear when given the alternative. If you are getting your enchanted gear from exp grinders, you can just wait a few more hours to get some gear that would be absolutely better in every situation. We hold onto our protection IV gear and everything else goes in the junk bin for situations where unenchanted gear would have sufficed anyway.

In fact, the only time we get to make a utility choice is when it comes to boots. At least with boots, Protection IV Feather Falling IV is not available. That means I can either have Protection IV or Protection III+Feather Falling. This is how it should be-It is balanced, it is situational, and most importantly, it adds a fun element to the game that really makes you think!

**How could armor enchants be improved**

Stop having one enchant that far surpasses all others. If one enchant is the best, that is the only enchant I will want. Any other enchant is just a disappointment and leaves me feeling like my grinding wasn't well spent.

I propose adding one more enchant: Melee Protection, to defend against swords, axes, unarmed, etc and then seriously nurfing protection(all).

In fact, Protection(all) should only be one quarter as strong as the other, more specific enchants. Four different kinds of protections for four different slots and one watered down version of all the others. That means I have a choicein my build. If I want equal protection to all elements, I can either wear protection IV everything or I could have fire prot IV boots, projectile prot IV helm, melee pro IVt chest, and blast prot IV legs.

That is two completely different sets of gear with the exact same outcome. The immediate benefit of this is that I never feel like I wasted my time when I get an enchant other than protection IV. This makes it so every piece has the potential to be a great part of a set, you just have to get pieces that work well with it. It still takes time to get a good set together. You might get a run of all fire protection and be sad, but when the other kinds of protection come along you will be able to use them.

Another major point: this system allows for situation specific gear builds. Under the current system, if I'm going to pvp I'm going to wear protection IV gear. If I'm going to kill mobs, I'm just going to wear protection IV gear. It's bland and it requires no thought.

In the proposed system, it would work a bit differently:

If I'm going to the nether, maybe I'll wear two pieces of Protection(all) and 2 pieces of (protection fire). I want to make sure I take less damage from mobs, but the environmental damage from fire is my primary concern.

What if I wanna grief noobs? They probably don't have TNT or Fire Aspect gear so maybe I'll just wear 2 pieces of Melee Protection and 2 Pieces of Projectile.

The point is that I have to think about what I'm doing depending on the situation.

**The concern with weapon enchants**

Same thing, you have Sharpness, which is great in every situation, and then two less useful enchants that cost exactly the same amount to create. Smite is really only good for pve and bane of arthropods is for really specific situations.

My favorite enchants are actually knockback and fire. They are cool utility enchants that add strength to your weapon without just increasing your damage output. Also, knock back is especially good for pvp and creeper busting. Fire doesn't work on certain mobs. It's fun, balanced, and exciting. We already have an enchant that makes you do more damage. Why do we need 2 more enchants that do exactly the same thing but not as well?

**How to improve weapon enchants**

I thought long and hard about this one. In another thread I suggested a pvp only enchant like smite for players. Upon reflection though, it's still boring, and frankly not as good as sharpness.

I feel strongly that the true solution is just to eliminate smite and Bane of Arthropods all together and replace with with another utility enchant: Sunder Armor - an enchant that increases the damage you inflict on armor.

A lot of people suggested either changing smite and bane to status effects because more damage is redundant, but how many status effects do we need? We already having potions of weakness, potions of slow. Why do we want to hamper those items by repeating them in enchants thus making them less useful?

There is no effect like sunder armor in the game. It would be a completely brand new addition. Also, it is completely situational. 

Would I use it for PvE? Probably not, armored mobs aren't so tough.

Would I use it for PvP? Maybe. Depends on a lot of things. Maybe I want to steal his gear, so this is no good. On the other hand, maybe I think he's going to heal a lot so breaking his armor would be more beneficial than sharpness.

Also, as an easy balance to this, the Unbreaking Enchant could be extended to weapons and armor in addition to tools. Unbreaking would be a much more balanced enchant than smite or Bane of Arthropods since sharpness already does the same thing except better.

Again, with this change I would really have to think about what I'm going to wear and why.

**Concerning game difficulty**

There is a significant number of players who actually like the current system because the less powerful enchants make the game harder. You are unable to create the best gear whenever you want, you have to wait for that protection IV helm even if it takes you 12 tries. This is the wrong kind of difficulty though. It is born of frustration, not of challenge or any obstacle other than time. Also, if you are a stat nut, any enchant other than the best is meaningless to you. 

Despite the fact that balancing the enchants, specifically for armor, would make every enchanted piece more useful, the changes I propose would actually make the game slightly harder. Protection(All) as it is now simply would not exist. That level of protection would not be available to you. At the same time, every single piece of enchanted gear would become that much more useful. 

**Anvils &amp; Naming Issues**

Making highly enchanted pieces of gear hard or impossible to repair is fine. It has been made pretty clear by the creators that they do not want you using one piece of gear forever. Unfortunately, this aspect is still extremely unbalanced for several reasons.

*One: Some highly enchanted items cannot be named.*

Why? If I have a Sharpness V Fire II Knockback II sword, that is the one I want to name. I want to give it a badass name like Armageddon so that it can be my trophy. If someone kills me, I want them to know just how valuable an item they have found. 

The current system makes it so I can either name my subpar items, or I have to guess at the name before I enchant it and hope that the two line up. This is simply not fun! 

A name is an aethsthetically pleasing addition to the game that we can all get behind.  It adds a fun RP element and a lot of novelty. I even support having a cost for it, such as the streamlined 5 levels for every other item, so that EVERY item doesn't get renamed. Making it extremely difficult or even impossible to enchant our favorite items is counter-intuitive and simply not fun.

*Two: Some pieces can be used forever, even extremely powerful ones.*

If I have a protection IV piece of armor, I can literally keep it repaired forever for much cheaper than it would be to make try and make a new piece. It is very unbalanced compared to weapons and tools.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

People spend a lot of time grinding so they can enchant their gear. Many of us do not want to make the game easier. The random enchanting process is fun because you have to keep trying to get what you want. But, having really imbalanced enchants that are good in every situation is not a very rewarding system. It would be more fun if you really had to think about what gear you needed for a specific situation than having one beat-all set. The current system also devalues any enchant that isn't the best one, especially in the case of armor. 

Also, if one wants to name their enchanted gear, it should not be prohibitively expensive.  Naming items is fun and adds a lot of novelty to the game. I support a cost, such as 3-7 levels of experience, because it stops people from naming every little thing and ruining the novelty of it, but the current system is unbalanced and frustrating.

It is sheerly there for dye. You can't even use it with a beacon! I wouldn't mind, but I can't stand finding Lapis and thinking ""why the hell do I need this?"" 

So here are a few ideas from worst to best:

5. **Luminence:** Rather simple, crafting glowstone dust around a lapis block would make a glowing lapis lazuli block. This could be used, obviously, as a light source. The use for this is somewhat aesthetic; it basically is used instead of torches or lamps or glowstone and would blend in more with normal lapis blocks.

4. **Hostile-mob repellant:** I've always felt lapis had a somewhat royal/mystical feel to it (just my opinion) and that it should act that way to mobs. **NON-PROVOKED** hostile mobs would ""respect"" it by avoiding anything surrounded by lapis lazuli (used like dust), not going within 4 blocks of the dust unless provoked.

3. **Mob Trap:** Basically #4, but used for another purpose. The mobs, once encircled by the lapis lazuli dust, would become unable to leave the boundaries of the dust. This could be used as a more efficient boundary for a mob farm. (Players, when encircled, will still be able to cross the boundaries, and flying mobs are not affected, nor are teleporting endermen)

~~2. **Lapis lazuli tools and armor:** Since lapis is somewhat common, it should be able to make tools and armor, too. The tools would have about the same durability as stone, and enchantability slightly below gold. The armor would be as durable as gold, or slightly more, and the protection level of gold, too.~~

1. **Signal Block:** Crafted with the same recipe as a beacon block, except with a lapis block instead of a nether star. It would shoot a beam of light similar to a beacon, but colored accordingly to the ingot you put inside. Gold would produce a yellow beacon, redstone would make red, iron would make white, lapis makes royal blue, emerald makes green, and diamond makes light blue.

Priests curing zombies. Nice idea.

Better still any zombie that hits a priest is either cured or destroyed on the spot (with a special effect), due to the all powerful nature of their God, Notch.

This means any village with a priest will generally have a pocket of safely around the priest of the village, though it would probably cease to be a village on hard mode as all the doors will have been removed, and the villagers all start wandering away.

Perhaps the blacksmith automatically replaces doors when he sees an appropriate doorway frame.

And besides that, the main world lacks any really *massive* mobs besides the biggest slimes, and I know for a lot of people, myself included, superflat mode was the first time they ever saw one generated naturally. The Nether has Ghasts, the End has the Ender Dragon, and the main world has nothing. So here are my own ideas on what mobs to include.

**Whales**

First off, for this I think a new weapon would be necessary. A harpoon, crafted with a piece of flint above two sticks, and a column of three strings to the right of it. You throw it at your target and once it's stabbed into the mob you're holding the rope attached to it. The mob can then drag you around freely. Meant to be used on whales and other watery mobs who can swim faster than you, but if you're a daredevil you can try using it on a ghast or ender dragon and see how long you can hold on.

Now, the actual whale. It'd be the biggest mob in the game, a bit longer than the ender dragon and a lot bulkier. They'd be neutral, but if you start a fight with them they'll become very aggressive. They'll open up their mouths and try to draw you inside, and if that doesn't work because your boat is fast enough they'll dive and then rise out of the surface again to capsize your boat. 

After attacking it for a good while, maybe for 25% of its health, it'll dive down and swim away. This is where you use the harpoon, letting it drag you to wherever it's headed. You have to pull back on the rope a bit the whole time, instead of just barely holding onto it, because otherwise the whale will pull you down below and wreck your boat. After a while it'll rise up again, giving you another chance to attack it. Lather, rinse, repeat.

The reward for all this hard work and labor? Stacks (or half stacks) of whale meat and oil. The meat is twice as good as beef, and the oil can be used as a fuel that burns longer than coal (I know oil is probably worse than coal in this but having a reward that's worse than the stuff you find in the ground just sucks). But not just that. It's best drop would be whale teeth, up to ten or twelve. Whale teeth can be used as an alternative to sticks in making handles for tools and swords. It increases both their durability and their enchantability. All of this can also be sold to villagers for pretty hefty sums. 

**TL;DR: A whale boss / mini-boss that would be the biggest mob in the game, requires a harpoon to kill, and drops a material that makes your tools and weapons better**

The rest of my ideas aren't nearly as hefty, so here's a nice list for the people who like lists.

1. Jellyfish. They'd come in the same range of sizes as slimes, plus one size that's larger still, and they'd be as big as two slimes stacked on top of each other. Two thirds of it would be the jellyfish head, the rest the tentacles and stingers. Jellyfish would mainly swim straight up or down with very slight angles away from it, always upright. They'd come in two varieties: Friendly, and poisonous, the difference between which should be clear enough. For the poisonous ones, if you swim through or touch their tentacles, you'll get stunned several seconds. Not very good underwater. With both jellyfish you can touch the top of their heads without being harmed. I don't really know how to classify them in terms of neutral or passive. Maybe ultra-passive. If you attack them they won't even bother to swim away. They'd drop slime balls, and split apart like them.

2. Marine fish come in big schools roughly the size of giant slimes. You can pick them off one by one with a fishing rod, or you can craft a new to catch them all in. A net would be one column of three strings with two columns of sticks on either side. Drag it behind you while on a boat and wait for a school to get close to the surface, net as many as you can and pick it up for 16 new fish to eat.

4. I already suggested this earlier and it was received rather well, encouraging me to post the rest of my water ideas, so I'll just link to the actual post: [Underwater clams that open up like chests and randomly have pearls inside](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/yfpo7/underwater_clams_that_open_up_like_chests_and/)

3. Villages that are near the ocean or near rivers spawn docks on the water. Dockworkers would also spawn, and they'd trade in both fishing supplies (rods, nets, boats, harpoons) and actual fish and fishy products likes pearls, whale stuff, and ink sacs. 

4. Palm trees! This is only tangentially related to the ocean, I know, but I still wanted to include it. They'd grow only in sand, only within a certain distance from water, and only in beaches and deserts. The distance increases with the size of the water in question but stops increasing at a certain point, letting beaches have palm trees spread out all over and desert oases or rivers have small more tightly knit groups of them. They'd drop coconuts, obviously enough, which can be drunk to replenish health or used as a potion ingredient. 

That's pretty much it. I'm not including ideas like sharks, dolphins, crocodiles or better boats because, while I'd definitely love them, they've all been explained and suggested in ways that I can't really improve on.

Crafting a map with a feather and an ink sac would create a ""Map &amp; Quill"". A map and quill works almost exactly the same as a map, and shares the same landscape image file as the map it was created from.

The difference is that when you hold a map and quill, your location is drawn onto that copy of the map. As you walk around the world, a trail is drawn on the map &amp; quill to show your path. The trail is only drawn when the map &amp; quill is in your hands, so you can put it away to interrupt the path, and then pick it up again later to continue the trail or draw a separate trail elsewhere.

The trail's color would vary depending on your altitude, appearing as very blue at bedrock, changing through green, yellow, and orange as you go higher up, and being written as red at very high altitudes. This would allow you to draw cave maps, since people could see your path underground and estimate what your general altitude was at each point. (P.S. the shades used would be slightly different from the map's landscape colors, so there's no worry of a green line getting swallowed up by grass, or a blue line of an underground tunnel not showing up on the ocean.""

When you're done drawing paths, just right click while holding the Map &amp; Quill. This would transform it into a ""Trail Map"", which no longer draws a trail when held but keeps whatever trails you marked on it while it was a Map &amp; Quill. You can duplicate trail maps by crafting a blank map with a trail map, and make as many copies as you want. You can also craft a Trail Map with a feather and ink sac to turn it back into a Map &amp; Quill, if you want to add more trails.

Map &amp; Quills and Trail Maps would share the same landscape data as the map they were created from. If the landscape changes, you can use any of the three map types to change the appearance of all map types. However the trail is not part of the landscape data, and is just written on top of it. So your normal maps will not have trails appear on them. And you can have many different trail maps, all created from the same map and sharing the same landscape data but showing different paths.

I think this would be very very useful. You could use it to mark roads on your world, or just make dots to mark cities and towns. The variable color of the trail would show depth and allow you to mark underground three dimensional routes. The uses of the Map &amp; Quill and Trail Map are practically endless.

When you're fighting monsters, it plays this peaceful piano music. Which is totally out of place for when it's playing. There should be different kinds of music that fits each biome. In the plains, and extreme hills and maybe oceans, the peaceful music that plays should still apply. But when you're in a desert, it's kind of like music that you would hear if someone was in a desert in a movie. Kind of like that Saudi Arabian or Indian sounding music. But here's the thing. During the night time, if it's turned on easy or higher, the music is intense. Not so much creepy. Just intense.
In the Nether, you hear this really eerie, or terrifying music. That should also be intense, but scary. Like heartbeats or something. 
In the End, there should be this just wrong music. When I say wrong, I mean, there should be scarier music, probably the same music you hear in the Nether.
When in caves, there isn't music, but there's more frequent ambiance. 
In swamps, there isn't music either, but you hear different kinds of noises. But fitting. Not any demons roaring or trains or blazes. But like mushy and squishy noises. With crickets chirping.
That's all the biome noises/music. But I also have a music disc suggestion. 
So me and my friend pulled this Herobrine joke on our friend once. And this popped up in my head, which creeped me right the fuck out. If you were to find this in an abandoned mine shaft, not a dungeon, but a mine shaft, you put it in a jukebox, you hear ""Herobrine is watching you."" But little girls are singing it. In a slow dragged out tone, with that echo-like noise. But instead of it being destroyed and broken, it has two glowing eyes on the disc.

I hope you like it . It's not an item , just another feature which can be better accepted by players ( I hope . )

So , as I wrote in the title , my idea is based on the fact that when you use a potion , the effect should appear in a little window in one of the edges of the screen ( or close to the heath bar ) . It's really good because when you're in PvP or just in danger , you don't need to open you inventory screen to know when to use another potion or just if you're safe enough with your potion . 

[EDIT]
Some people gave me nice ideas to now show the effects and I created new versions !

http://imageshack.us/a/img846/9736/newpotionidea.png
http://imageshack.us/a/img210/1023/closeuppotion.png

PS1.: There should be an option in the Video Settings about the oppacity of the little windows

PS2.: Other effects like Wither effect should appear too 

PS3.: I'm not sure if Beacon effects should appear since they will be in the screen as long as you're in its effect radius . So , it should only appear in the inventory screen .

PS4.: Instant potion such as Instant Health should appear since there's no reason of a window just appear and disappear instantly.

Thanks ALLCAPSON , Hysix and Sigurd4 for highlighting some things and making it a better thing .

[/EDIT]
Well , I think that's it . This is the first thread I create in Reddit and there are a lot of possibilities to do with this concept . I hope you guys like it ( as I said at the beggining , hahah XD )

Make the nether and adventure, something to look forward to, but also something to prepare diligently for.

- Have the endermen construct additional spires in The End out of stolen blocks and once completed another healing crystal will be added for the dragon.

It may not be an issue to most of you but the ability to be able to change it once in a long while might be a good idea for us who have names we regret choosing at the time.

I know this could have issues, like people changing usernames and then coming back onto servers if they were previously banned from, but maybe someone could think of an idea to counter-act this issue? Such as a simultaneous IP and username ban perhaps.

Would much prefer a feature like this rather than having to buy another copy of minecraft to change this one thing.

Cheers very much for reading and I hope I've made sense!

(Tell me if I need to explain anything a bit more)

**EDIT:** Good to know it has already been considered by Mojang so there's progress there.

**EDIT 2:** I think that the main idea is that we will be able to use an UUID to ban people and then have a changeable display name which we can vary after a reasonable interval. There was mention of a display name history which is a good way of nullifying the whole confusion of what names certain players used to go by. I'm sure now that it's work in progress, and I highly anticipate its arrival!",,False,,t5_2s3oo,1345405397.0,,,True,t3_ygwei,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/ygwei/minecraft_username_change/,

We've all gotten used to the ""Look, a vein of iron. Mine that up real quick. Or look, redstone and a few diamonds!""

Well, I've always wished that it wasn't quite like this. In real life, we have mines set up in locations rich in a specific mineral. We don't just dig somewhere where it would be convenient and find every material we need.

---

So now into the suggestion! I would like to see a new option under more options tab. This button would say the following; ""Ore Generation: Classic"". When clicked, it will cycle between classic, large veins, and regional. I will go into more detail of each setting below.

**Classic**

Classic ore generation is exactly how it is now. Veins are small, all over the place and randomly mixed among other veins in the caves below. There's nothing more to explain here.

**Large Veins**

This setting, the second one, is only slightly different than classic; simply put, the veins of ore are around **four times larger** than classic, but also four times as rare. When you find a vein of coal, you could mine there for quite a while before running out and needing to find a new one. In this generator type, finding a vain of ore is a good thing, not just something you'll pass up since there are so many. It gives more meaning to find a single vein of ore. 

Of course, people who choose this generator type will need to adjust mining strategies to account for the different vein size and rarity.

**Regional**

This is one that I've wanted for a really long time. Instead of all ore types just mixed together in any given location, ores are regional, like caves. Whether it be by biome or just random, this generator type would be massive fun. Instead of setting up branch mines wherever someone feels like it, you would need to prospect to find a mineral rich area with the minerals you need, then set up some sort of mining outpost there. This encourages building settlements in mineral rich areas, exploration, and realism to the game (Of course, it's only one generator type! You wouldn't have to use it).

Now I'll explain a bit more. This would be exactly like large veins mode, but under certain biomes/areas, 80% (or so) of ALL ore veins would be changed into that area's main resource. This only applies to the Y levels that those ores naturally spawn in classic. For instance, lets say you found an area with an abundance of diamonds (which would be more rare than finding areas rich in other materials). The materials in above layers would generate exactly like in large vein mode, but be less frequent. At diamond level, diamonds will be more plentiful.

Imagine this; on an SMP server, one village was built around an area rich in iron. The people who live here, naturally, have an abundance of iron supplies. A different town, over a naturally diamond rich area, would not have as much iron material, but they would be very strong with diamond gear proven they use proper mining methods. They may develop slower due to lack of better tools at first, but overall they will pick up and become better than the town over iron.

---

**TL;DR: Two new ore generation options; ""large veins"" for larger, but rarer veins of ore, and ""regional"", for ores abundant in some ares while lacking everywhere else.**

Right-clicking with a shield doesn't *reduce* the damage you take, but every hit you take has a chance of being *completely negated!*  If the attack is stopped, your shield takes damage.  If it isn't, *you* take damage.  First, obviously, we will need a crafting recipe.  Here is my thought:

http://i.imgur.com/PT2hK.png?1?7984

The stick is for the handle, and the leather is for the back padding (as many actual shields had).  Also, left-clicking on a mob with the shield will bash it, causing a little damage, as well as a little knockback (and reducing the durability, of course).  My ideas for materials follow:

* Leather Shield: 15% Block Chance, Very Low Attack, Least Durable
* Wood Shield: 20% Block Chance, Low Attack, Little Durability
* Cobblestone Shield: 35% Block Chance, Medium Attack, Somewhat Durable
* Iron Shield: 50% Block Chance, Medium-High Attack, Very Durable
* Diamond Shield: 70% Block Chance, Very High Attack, Extremely Durable
* Gold Shield: 75% Block Chance, Medium-High Attack, Very Low Durability

Those are the basics.  Some enchantments could be added to these as well:

* Unbreaking I-III: Same as the tool enchantment
* Coverage I-IV: Increases block chance by 5% each increment
* Knockback I-II: Same as weapon enchantment
* Power I-V: Increases damage from bashing

Since then the idea has been growing steadily. I'd like the see a temple sized (maybe not shaped though...) adventure addon called a ""Creeper Nest"". It'd have a single creeper spawner, no chests, but a creepy looking cave, using mossy cobble. It could even have generation behavior just like a spawner cave, though the frequency would have to be toned down. I have 2 ideas for this structure involving adding new blocks. 

A) Glycerin: Glycerin would be a creeper nest only liquid block. It would be yellow in color and could catch fire, only on the surface of course. Glycerin would burn off like a wooden block, though take much longer; the spread rate would also need to be incredible. This could also double for oil in later updates that may include things like lamps and lanterns. The behavior would need to double water's except for the fire bit, if say, glycerin were set in the nether, it would run like water, but if it hit lava, or the stream was ignited, there would be a rapid spread leading to the source block which would burn off as normal. Glycerin would, for all intents and purposes, be a median point of lava and coal in terms of a furnace fuel. The furnace would burn a bucket of Glycerin for 64 items (I just like the idea that it'd be rounded out, that's all). Glycerin would have another use, but I need to explain my other block first...

B) Sulfur: Sulfur would be a mineable block, a new ore, it would look like emeralds, but the color would be yellow. The block would look like flint, but yellow, drop say, 1-2 per block? Sulfur would have 2 uses, the most important use being, combined with coal it creates gun powder. Say, like the tnt recipe, but the sulfur would take the place of the gunpowder and the coal, the place of the sand. Vice versa perhaps? The second use I will explain below, because it comes into conjunction with the glycerin. 

When placing a bucket of glycerin in the center of the crafting grid, and placing 7 sulfur around it with a glass bottle underneath the bucket, you could create a Nitro Glycerin, a bottle, like a splash potion that would act like TNT, only more powerful in terms of block destruction. The ground would have to leave virtually no drops of anything hit by the bottle. This would cut down on server abuse and discourage over using it regardless. 

The cave itself would just have to be pretty creepy. Mossy cobble, vines maybe.... Coal would need to be generated in frequency in the walls of the nest. it's also have to be very rare, just as much, or more so than the temples. Perhaps an actual nest made of obsidian? If you did make a nest of obsidian you could put the spawner underneath it and it would be more difficult to get at it. Similarly, I would think that the generation would have to be below block 40, like slimes. That would decrease encounters with them too early for player to deal with them. 


I just thought this would be a cool addition to our minecraft world. Something random, scary and a bit overdue, if we're being honest. 


~EDIT~

So I did a small mock up of the original idea. I used gold ore for sulfur, water for Glycerin and emerald blacks in substitute for creeper eggs. I also didn't get the vines to grow all the way to the floor, but meh. The spawner is also inside the obsidian nest, where it can make the creepers, but not be blown apart by explosions. Also (obviously, but) the lightsources are just there so I can show you, it'd be dark when you first entered. Anyways, Here's an example of my original idea (though in hindsight, I'd like to see it a bit larger....)

I am very disappointed with how little Mojang thinks about SMP. 

I have a few points to address:

&amp;nbsp;

**Good PvP enchantments.**

---

This is one of the things I hate most about Minecraft at the moment. My clan on my server has a full double chest dedicated to shitty enchanted armor. We have loads of projectile, blast and fire protection. We also have a shitload of swords with smite, bane and knockback. At least 150 diamonds are used for things we won't use at all. The only enchantments I want is Sharp IV, Fire II and protection IV. Those are the only usefull enchantments for PvP. 

Why? We all know that the mobs in Minecraft are way to easy, you don't need a bane swords for spiders or a smite sword for skellies and zombies. I suggest a new range of enchantments which are really usefull for PvP. One of my ideas was simply including unbreaking enchantment for armor [because you won't need to enchant 4 pieces with prot IV to be maximally protected.](http://wiki.hcsmp.com/index.php?title=Guide:_PVP#Armour_Enchantments) (Note, HCSMP is not my server, this is just a good guide).


Yes, I only mentioned the unbreaking enchantment because I'm not very good at thinking of more. You could surely name some in the comments! I also think feather falling is one of the best enchantments because it's so simple, useful and well-thought of.


Another thing about the enchantments for armor is the fact that protection IV is the same as projectile, blast and fire protection. It's 3 in one, but still it takes as much effort to get regular Protection IV as the others. This should really change. I had an idea to include special protection against potions too. Potions are used very regularly.

**Anti-griefing measures.**

---

Although I know that most of the Minecraft servers in existence don't allow griefing and have anti-griefing mods, Mojang could also help a bit with us. As I said, I play on a server where griefing is allowed. This is a server where roleplaying is heavily encouraged. Some clans are really awesome with the griefing rules, (don't grief a city if there's a shrine dedicated to your clan, etc.) but a lot of 12 year old kids hear of our server and just attack a city armed with stone pickaxes and have bed nearby to respawn and start again. Yes, I know this is inevitable but Mojang could at least *try* to stop this. The addition of the Witcher in the latest snapshot is a ridiculously easy way grief a city. Just build a witcher, log off, log on a few hours later and look at the destruction the Witcher caused. Mojang should start thinking about this when implementing features. I have the feeling their main focus is single player, which gets boring after a while (at least for me).

&amp;nbsp;

**A new fighting system:**

---

At the moment, most part of Pvp is like this *""W, W, click click click click, S, space, click click click click.""* You just try to hit your opponent as often as possible. There is not technic in hitting your opponent at all. The function of blocking (by clicking RMB) is a weak attempt at make it more interesting. I usually forget about that function anyway. I see no one using it. Ever. What I suggest is a sword fighting mechanism a bit similar to how it is in the to-be-released game [Chivaly: Medieval Warfare \(Which is now on kickstarter\)](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1711512107/chivalry-medieval-warfare?ref=category)

If you move your mouse from the left to the right while you click, your sword makes the same movement. The same counts for when you move it from up to down, down to up and from right to left. That way people would have to dodge or block hits. It would make it way more interesting.

&amp;nbsp;

**Last but not least: anti hack measures:**

---

At the moment, the anti-hacker protection Mojang put in the game is close to zero. Our server admins have to often guess whether something is x-ray with the help of plugins such as [LogBlock](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/logblock/) or [NoCheatPlus](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/nocheatplus/), which are both not perfect. At the moment our admins (who have sort of given up hope that Mojang will change anything about it) are desperately waiting for the Modding API to arrive so we can finally have a decent anti-cheat protection.

&amp;nbsp;

I guess that's about it, feel free to leave suggestions in the comments,  maybe I'll edit them in this post too!

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit, forgot to add this one: Stackable potions:**

---

When fighting with potions, it's terribly annoying to stand still once in a while to put potions in your hotbar when you have run out. This is also something Mojang has not thought about. I was thinking about maybe stacks of 4 or 8.

&amp;nbsp;

2. You can right click a painting to switch to the next painting until you find the one you want. This wouldn't cause any more problems than left clicking does currently.

Not only that, but it'll finally give your villages the natural dirt paths that you've wanted. Similar to how sand gets converted to sandstone, four blocks of dirt should be turned into packed dirt. Grass and plants will not be able to grow on packed dirt and it will take slightly longer to dig up unlike regular dirt. Packed dirt can also be crafted back into dirt if someone wishes to do so.

But I found that I was ""plateauing"" or generating lower quality horses. My ranch started to look like a glue factory. So I began to wonder how stats were passed to children.

So I went and found the [code](https://github.com/Bukkit/mc-dev/blob/master/net/minecraft/server/EntityHorse.java) or at least I hope its the code...

More importantly:

		//Health
        double d0 = this.a(GenericAttributes.a).b() + entityageable.a(GenericAttributes.a).b() + (double) this.cL();
		//15 - 30 half hearts.
        entityhorse1.a(GenericAttributes.a).a(d0 / 3.0D);
		
		//Jump strength 0 - 2?
        double d1 = this.a(bv).b() + entityageable.a(bv).b() + this.cM();
        entityhorse1.a(bv).a(d1 / 3.0D);
		
		//Move speed
        double d2 = this.a(GenericAttributes.d).b() + entityageable.a(GenericAttributes.d).b() + this.cN();
        entityhorse1.a(GenericAttributes.d).a(d2 / 3.0D);

So for the obfuscated java impared... **It generates stats for a new horse as if it had spawned and averages those with both parents.**

This makes it mathematically difficult to breed a better horse. Like REALLY difficult. Lets suppose you wanted to breed yourself a tank-horse with 15 hearts (30 health). Unless you have two horses with 15 hearts already I'm fairly certain (unless health is rounded up in which case this example is flawed) then you CANNOT breed a 15 heart horse. 

The average of three numbers can never be greater than those three numbers. The only hope of generating a better horse is that the random stat component is near perfect and will slightly weight your horse up the scale. But its also hard to measure these slight increases in stats. For movement speed I've managed a crude speed test but its no where near accurate enough to decern minor speed differences in horses.

So I have two competing suggestions for better horse breeding math.

1. **Per stat choose a random parent stat and average it with the random one. This creates a punnett square kind of feel to the numbers.**

1. **Per stat choose a random parent stat and offset it with random numbers chosen from a [curve](https://www.google.com/search?q=x%5E4). (Big offsets rarer than little offsets)**

Scheme 1 will still plataeu at max stats but at least let you generate better horses more easily.

Scheme 2 could be harder to tweak so its not over powered but would let you if lucky generate a max stat horse.

- Placing cobblestone it is would yield gravel.

- Placing gravel in it would yield sand.

- Placing gravel and bonemeal/rotten flesh(need a use for that stuff) would yield dirt.

This combined with a furnace, cobblestone generator and tree farm would essentially be able to produce an infinite amount of stone, cobblestone, gravel, sand and dirt although would be require more effort than simple going out and mining for these blocks.

Although this may seem like an unnecessary item in the game I feel that it would be useful for console ports and would not break the game in any way or necessarily detract from any enjoyment of the game.

Plan: A dispenser shoots a wooden block across the room. Behind the wooden Block is a sticky piston with a resting High signal. When the trap is tripped an arrow is fired out of the dispenser. If it misses it will land squarely into the wooden block. Later, a signal will be sent to recycle the arrows. The piston will pull back into a low state. This shakes the arrows off the target block. From here they would fall in to a Hopper to be transported back to the original dispenser or on to the next dispenser.

Suggestion: Arrows that have been shot can fall into a hopper. I think a good limitation on this is arrows that have already landed, but Shooting them directly into the hopper could also be an option. This effect would not work for Mob arrows.

My solution to this is to allow storage minecarts to pick up items by running over them.

Benefits:
Automation is made possible where it was not.
There is a fairly hight resource cost to making the system (powered rails and minecarts).
This is similar to a pre-existing mechanic with empty carts picking up mobs.
Items can be moved back out of storage by breaking the cart.

Problems: 
Storage minecarts have some glitches.
Moving things out of storage minecarts requires the destruction of the cart, which cannot be automatically undone.

This would give off no light or particle effects but would provide BL: 15 in a 10 block radius in all directions around the incense, preventing all hostile mob spawning. Most importantly this effect would go through blocks so you can hide them under floors/behind walls.

As for it being called incense, I think it's a good way for it to ""make sense"" in the world, mobs simply not liking the smell of smouldering lapis.

Below is an MS paint job of incense, along with some examples of builds that would benefit from not being covered in torches/recessed lighting. http://imgur.com/a/3wl07

**Neutral:** Players can over hunt species wiping them out locally forcing exploration, and generating eco-activists on servers, and driving up the price of food.

Players will need to wall off or protect their livestock. If wolves find a treasure trove of food they will eat it all and breed like bunnies.

**Downsides:** Programming work involved. Though Mojang did bring someone on specifically to improve mob AI. I always thought something like this would be the natural result. 

'Evil' players might breed animals in a secret location, then spend spare time wiping out all wild populations so he can overcharge everyone when selling food. (totally what I would try to do)

**All -** Once a chunk spawns peaceful mobs, it never does so again. When a chuck is unloaded their position is saved for the next time the chunk is loaded.

**All -** Animals have hunger levels. If they are hungry at all they do nothing but roam for food. If it reaches zero, they die and turn into a patch of tall grass. As long as it is full, they roam for a partner to mate with. The newborn starts off hungry.

**Tall Grass -** Spreads on its own. Mostly during rain.

**Flower -** Spreads on its own (much slower than grass). Mostly during rain.

**Sheep -** Feeds on tall grass.

**Horse -** Feeds on tall grass.

**Cow -** Feeds on tall grass

**Pig -** Feeds on tall grass (and possibly baby animals of other species like real life)

**Bats -** Fly around at night and destroy flowers for food.

Well I suggest adding a fattening up effect like the one in 2.0 (though not as silly)

If you think about it, pigs have a reputation of being fattened up for county fairs and whatnot, so it would have some real-life correlation.

So here's how it would work: Use wheat to breed pigs like normal. Get baby pigs. Feed baby pigs blocks (bales) of wheat to make them gradually grow. Similiar to breeding, there is a period of waiting between feedings. Once they reach adult size, they can breed again, and if slaughtered they drop the usual 1-3 porkchops. However, you can continue to feed them and make them fat. They'll grow slower and slower, up to a maximum size. At max size, they'll drop 9-12 pork chops.

I'm thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 feedings to grow baby pigs to the current adult size, then 5 more to grow to max size.

Additional idea: place blocks of wheat and pigs will eat it automatically, resulting in auto-fattening (but not auto-breeding)

This would add more value to wheat and pig farming, as it would allow for more food than cow farming.",,False,,t5_2s3oo,False,,,True,t3_1cpn6n,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1cpn6n/fatten_up_pigs_with_wheat_to_yield_more_pork_upon/,

The current diamond block in the Beacon doesn't make much sense, considering diamond isn't used in the recipe.  The 12w36a Beacon featured a Nether Star instead, which both made more sense and looks a lot better.  I realize that there was some issues with it, but from what I've read the issues involved a ton of Beacons being placed, which I think is an acceptable trade-off, especially because from what I've read the number of Beacons needed to cause problems is a lot more than would likely ever be used.

Personally, I think the beam should be changed back as well, but I realize that not everyone shares this opinion and there are some issues that come with it.  I would be more than willing to look past these issues, such as not being able to see water while standing in a Beacon, as they would be rather uncommon and wouldn't change gameplay too much.

I have come here today to tell you of a tragedy waiting to happen across all servers/creative player worlds.


It is the flood, and it is very, very nigh. http://i.imgur.com/Tfyu1.png


This structure is very easy to make on a creative server. All you need is to place two walls of water next to whatever you want to flood, and the new water physics will do the rest to make a giant cube of water, lagging and perhaps crashing the server in the process.


The new physics will also ruin other things as well.

* SO HERE IS MY SOLUTION:
when water is spreading on top of water, only create a new source block when there are two source blocks *directly across* from it. Like so: http://i.imgur.com/NvsFs.png

Implement new commands which make the command block constantly check its surroundings for certain events, and send off a redstone pulse if these events occur. The Command Block would still have to be powered, though. 

I thought of:

* **/listen:** constantly monitors chat, and sends a redstone pulse when a specified phrase is said. 

 **Example:** /listen Abracadbra 5. This would send off a redstone pulse if someone in a 5 block radius said ""Abracadabra"". Useful for 'Spells' or maybe even some sort of dialogue implementation.

* **/radar:** Checks for players in a specified radius. 

 **Example:** /radar 4. Sends off a pulse if someone comes close to the Command Block. Useful alternative to pressure plates/tripwires.

* **/bud:** Probably the most useful one. Checks if any block touching the command block is updated, and sends off a pulse. This does not take a  radius input.

* **/clock:** Checks the time and sends off a pulse at certain times. Can take multiple inputs. 

 **Example:** /clock 0 12000. This would send off a pulse at sunrise and sunset.

* **/checkinventory:** Checks the inventory of players within a certain radius for certain items. Takes a radius input and an item id input, and an optional counter input. 

 **Example:** /checkinventory 5 267 1.  This checks if players within a 5 block radius carry one iron sword. Useful for quests and classes in custom maps.

An advanced option would include a timer input, determining how often the block should check. (e.g. /bud 10 checks for a block update every 10 ticks)

I am very well aware that this could cause performance issues when used excessively, but I thought I'd still share the idea with you guys. I also have no idea about java coding and therefore do not know if this would even be possible.

- *A specific mob spawns during this small time frame; I.e. Untamed Zombie / Skeleton Horses [however, regardless, these would still be fairly uncommon to find during the event]. The following would also give a player something to look forward to.*

- *Small Mushrooms begin to pop-up in arbitrary locations.* - [Not sure about this one].

The new **whistle** item is craftable, perhaps with an iron or gold ingot and a piece of paper.

When the player holds and right-clicks, they whistle loudly. I'm thinking that by default this would cause all **pets** (ie. cats and dogs) to be teleported to the player. Since horses are not explicitly attached to a particular player, this would not work on them.

However, **when the whistle is named in an anvil it has the ability to call any mob with the same name**. Horses are the obvious use, but if you suddenly want Jerry the slime or Simon the creeper teleported to your side, then that's your business.

**Further thinking**

* An alternate recipe could require a nametag to be used in the crafting of the whistle. These whistles would only call a mob with the same name. I don't like the whistles being limited in this way, but I do like the whistles being more expensive to make.
* The whistle should have a range limitation - it would only work on mobs in adjacent loaded chunks (and in the same dimension).
* Perhaps the mob should begin to walk towards the player when it hears the whistle rather than teleport. The AI is probably not smart enough (that's why pets teleport), but teleporting horses seems a bit OP somehow.
* When a whistle is used, some of the smarter hostile mobs in range will hear it and try and find the player by heading in their general direction. 
* There's an amusing griefing possibility that might need to be guarded against: Say you have a horse called 'Pamela' and someone else knows you have a whistle for that horse, they could name a nearby creeper 'Pamela' too.

Inventing a new seed name that you will throw away in 10 minutes if you don't like it enough is tedious, and people probably randomly input the same stuff anyways (I bet names of planets or chemical elements were tried more than once independently by different people).

However, if the game automatically provides a random, human-readable phrase, or even just a collection of words, the coolness will be remembered. Just [four basic nouns](http://xkcd.com/936/) would be enough for a hundred billion different seeds, that is if the order of words doesn't matter. [5 random English nouns (including obscure ones)](http://oxforddictionaries.com/words/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language) will cover all currently available seeds.

EDIT: Possible implementations

**Generate a random bunch of words as a seed when no specific seed is given**

The seed needs to be stored as both the number (hash) and the string.

If no specific seed is provided, a random bunch of words from a dictionary is used instead, and stored with the world. The /seed command displays both the string (which now always exists) and the number. A nice extra option would be to set the maximum number of words you want to see in your seed.

[**Map each seed to a bunch of words.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1a70vc/instead_of_using_a_random_number_as_default_seed/c8us7br)

The seed is stored as it is now.

To display the seed in a human-readable way, take the seed as an unsigned number, a dictionary of fixed size N, and then just write the seed in base N with each digit being a word from the dictionary. On input, numbers are read as numbers, strings that contain words from the dictionary only are interpreted as a number in base N, all others are hashed.

They feel more like orchards. Why? Many reasons, but chief among them is ground cover. In Minecraft, forests have grass everywhere. Real forests only have grass in clearings and meadows - otherwise there's dirt, dead leaves, and herbs.

I propose adding a ""dead leaves"" block that works like snow (i.e. a thin layer). Anything directly below a live leaf block has a random chance of getting a layer of dead leaves.

As in real life, walking on dead leaves would give a delightful crunching sound.

Dead leaves would prevent the spread of grass. They'd also have a random chance of ""decomposing"" - in which case they'd disappear and change an underlying grass block into dirt.

Thus, any forest in Minecraft, whether planted or natural, would gradually gain a floor of leaves and dirt. A deforested area would gradually be taken over by grass.

My guess is that coding this would be very straightforward, given that it has so much in common with the existing snow system. If I'm correct, it would mean a very big payoff in terms of atmosphere for relatively little effort.

OPTIONAL FURTHER ADDITIONS
-A crunching sound underfoot would dramatically improve the atmosphere in a forest.
-Obviously the dead leaves would integrate well with a ""seasons"" update. There could be a particle effect for leaves falling, similar to the current effect for when it's snowing.
-When harvested, dead leaves could be used to mulch crops. Or, perhaps a compost bin block could be added, and the leaves would make an excellent compost ingredient.
-Dead leaves could affect the growth patterns of mushrooms.

OTHER WAYS TO IMPROVE FOREST ATMOSPHERE
-Change how trees grow, so that they fill out the available sunlight (just like real ones). Trees planted in open fields would spread their leaves (and branches) father out, while trees planted in forests would grow taller.
-Some shade-loving herbs would go a long way toward further improving the forest atmosphere - and could serve as potion ingredients.

Think of it like the jumping-around-corners tactic for the Heavy in TF2: You can spin up the minigun in mid-air, and you don't slow down until you land again, allowing for less delay if you're getting the jump on someone.

EDIT: This would also result in more realistic, and therefore farther, arcs after being launched by something. Right now, if you get launched by something and you go really fast, you can stop in mid-air and fall straight down, while with other game physics it would take a lot longer and you'd go a lot farther before stopping.

Maybe a block of sand could also occasionally spawn in the center as if the children made a sand castle, and I'd imagine that would be easy to do with entities and whatever. Also, this would probably be limited to normal villages, as desert villages are kinda already in a desert.

**EDIT:** /u/turdmogrol suggested that breaking the sand castle results in losing some village popularity. The villager who made the castle would get the angry particles when you break it.

**Tombstone Block**

* Can be placed in one of four directions.
* Crafted with smooth stone in a 2x3 arrangement.
* Engraved with a message upon placement like signs, i.e, ""RIP Steve, violently dismembered by a misunderstood creeper.""
* Increases spawn rate of skeletons, zombies, spiders, and bats during the night.
* Nearby tilled land in a 9x9 block produce poisoned crops.
* Preserves tilled land similar to water for the purpose crops and grave plots.
* Spawned in some villages and graveyards.
* Villagers, when killed, have a chance to respawn at a tombstone as a zombie villager.

**Graveyards**

* Randomly spawned in plains and deserts.
* Constructed with cobblestone walls, cobblestone, mossy cobblestone, and iron bars.
* Arranged with gravel roads similar to villages.
* Roads connect to plots with several grave sites.
* Grave sites contain tombstones and tilled land (graves) arranged in a grid.
* 5% of graves contain a treasure chest under the tilled land.
* ...2% of graves contain some sort of trap when dug.  (Grave-robbing is bad, kids!)
* Poisoned crops appear on occasion.
* Flowers are spawned nearby or on grave sites.
* Pumpkins patches!
* Random heads are occasionally spawned on cobblestone walls.
* Zero to two large graves are spawned within the graveyard with a higher treasure yield, but they're usually booby-trapped.

1373732800.0,82,self.minecraftsuggestions,1i81tn,Higher maximum levels of enchantment for golden items.,Ryan_Ash,95,13,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1i81tn/higher_maximum_levels_of_enchantment_for_golden/,"**The way it is now:** Golden swords/armor/tools have a higher enchantability than the others, but at the same time they have lower durability, armors give less protection and the sword deals less damage. The higher enchantability alone doesn't bounce out the negatives of Gold making it inferiour to iron and even more to diamond.

**My Suggestion:** In Addition to higher enchantability, golden stuff should also allow for higher maximum enchantment levels. I'm thinking of one Level higher for each enchantment. 

**will this be OP?** No, most of the enchants like unbreaking, protection or sharpness are already countered by the low durability, protection and damage of golden items. Fortune IV Sound OP, but as mining diamond or redstone with a golden pick doesn't drop anything it won’t work for those anyway, so fortune would only be good for coal and netherquartz. Looting might be an issue, but we would have to deal with the less amount of damage dealt by the sword and the lower durability in turn, so this is balanced as well IMO.

**What are the Pros?** 

* Golden items would have benefits, that are not given by other stuff, bouncing out the negatives of gold.

* It would add to the status of golden items being not part of the usual tier-system, but standing out as having the enchantability as specific feature.

* It propably won’t be much work to add this, as the enchantments are already in the game, the higher levels are just not available in vanilla. All they would have to do is to adjust the enchantments and enchantment levels we can get by enchanting golden stuff.

Gather around, gather around. I have recently discovered through my extensive research ways to make new, viable potions, and I need you to help me get my new designs approved by the Board of Mojang!

http://i.imgur.com/9WfDt9X.png

Let's get started shall we?

=== **Actual need for different foods!** ===

First off, as I'll highlight later, is that some of these potions use forms of different foods. With the current epidemic causing Minecrafters to only grow only one type of plant, or only breed one type of animal, I feel this would lead to a potato famine. But I wouldn't know. I'm an alchemist, not a nutritionist!

=== **Mining with protein!** ===

I have discovered, fellow peers, that steak makes that tired mining arm of yours swing faster! By combining cow meat encased in the magical element of gold, and chucking it into an awkward potion, I have made a potion that can make my coal miners work at a better efficiency! And, erm, I suppose you can corrupt the potion as well with a fermented spider eye...

=== **Swimming with the fishes!** ===

I figured this one was a no-brainer, but realized there was no patent on it. By combining a fish with gold (those magical properties work wonders!), and putting it into a awkward potion, you can create a potion that allows you to breath water, just like our scaled friends! Just, don't try to breathe air under the effects of this brew.

=== **Mario and mushrooms!** ===

While studying an Italian plumber, I've come to the conclusion that mushrooms make you jump higher. By mashing up a brown and red mushroom, and then combining them in an awkward potion, you too can reach the sky!

=== **Extract the Properties** ===

Now, in my time, I've eaten a golden apple or two. And I've sipped my fair share of health potions. So, I figured, ""Why not?"" and decided to mix the two. The result was a potion that allowed to take less damage when my coal miners attacked me.

=== **Turn out the lights** ===

Here it is: the corrupted version of a Night Vision potion. I can't really take credit for this one. All I did was add a fermented spider eye, and BAM! My vision went straight to tiny, and all I could see was my brewing stand!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

In conclusion, I think the Board of Mojang should approve my research because of blah blah blah. It's cool stuff, what else is there to say?

--------------------------------------------------------------------
In all actuality, though, I really do think Mojang should add these potions. They have the code for them already, we just don't have the potions for them. Also, more reasons to use different foods, so, yea. I'm kind of just rambling now. Er... is that a cat trying to get in my window? Shoo, cat! Away with thee!

A block similar to soul sand and ice. It makes you and any mobs that walk on it slower, with added slipperiness. This could be avoided by wearing boots. The crafting recipe could be a 2x2 block of slimeballs.

* More use for slimes

* Outrun mobs/players without boots

**Wolf Caves**

A small cave in the side of a mountain inhabited by wolves. If you get close to it, wolves in the cave and surrounding area turn hostile. At the end of the cave, there could be some loot or rare ore. 

* Gives a home for wolves

* More usage of wolves

Well, considering that slimes are, well, *slimes*, I think that they should be able to absorb items that are dropped and kinda ""jiggle"" them around inside of them. You can still be able to see the items in the slime, but it's gonna have a green, mucky look. You may only get the items back by killing the slime yourself. You may also drown it and make it die of fall damage, but if it dies in lava, you will not get the item back. Say if you die near a large cluster of slimes. All your items are now spewed out infront of them and they just ""absorb"" them. Then, it's gonna be twice as hard getting the items back, giving Minecraft more of it's good ol' survival-esque situations.
2. If slimes could do this, map-makers could use slimes in adventure maps so players could gather items. Ex: To get starter weapons and armor, you will need to find as many slimes as you can through out a specific cave system that have absorbed that item.

3. Gold Pressure Plate and Spawner - A gold pressure plate would give only items the ability to activate the pressure plate, that way mobs from the spawner could not activate it, however the player would have to be very cautious about killing the mobs, due to their drops having the potential to land on the pressure plate.

It occurred to me today that other games/settings already have a perfect method for separating heads from their owners: [vorpal swords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorpal_sword).

Vorpal swords are typically depicted as having a chance to outright kill a foe by decapitating it.  In Minecraft, this would probably be best changed to an enchant which, on the killing blow, has a chance to cause your opponent to drop its head in addition to its normal loot.  Higher levels of the enchant could have higher chances to cause head drops.

Used against mobs, the heads would simply be the already-implemented head items.  Against players, however, this becomes a powerful PvP ""bragging rights"" system.  Rather than dropping a generic ""player head"", it could drop that player's skinned head, with name and ""slain by"" lore text already in place:

To start, they need their own trees. They should be willow trees, having their own log, planks, and sapling, with two variants, big and small, like the trees in jungles, with the big ones having 2x2 trunks and small ones having 1 block trunks. Secondly, these trees should spawn in water more, and be closer together on land, to get that dense, swampy feeling. Next, giant mushrooms should RARELY spawn on land. It may not be the best addition, but I feel like it would be cool. Next, the water in swamps should look more green, to simulate algae, rather than its current dark blue/green color. Last of all, it needs some of its own mobs, such as frogs/toads, alligators, and maybe snakes. The standard mobs, like pigs, sheep, chickens,and cows, shouldn't spawn here, due to the fact that they don't actually live in swamps. UPDATE 1: I have formed new ideas. How about villages in swamps, but on water? Considering the fact that swamps are mostly water, it would work. They would look more like huts, rather than actual houses. Another idea would be tall grass/cattails that grow on top of water near the edges of land in swamps. An even better idea I had would to have a luminescent mob - the firefly. It would be tiny (essentially particle-sized), and emit a small amount of light as it flys around, maybe with a green or yellow-ish tint.

Here a couple of reasons of why it could be imo a nice addition and why it somehow makes sense (*well I mean for the game but probably a bit less for everyone's health bar*):

* **[Balance reason]** Currently when you try to [break an horse](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Horse#Taming) you have a certain chance of success, that is 0% in the first attempt and it increases by 5 each time you fail (0% 5% 10% 15% and so on), and you can nicely boost that chance with different kinds of [food](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Horse#Foods), but to be honest even without food it's only a matter of seconds and few attempts before a horse is tamed and that leaves to the food ""boosting"" feature  a very little use aside the role play; **tldr** *to make food more useful during the breaking process*

* **[Difficulty reason]** It's true that looking for a horse takes some efforts but as I already said breaking one of them is conversely really simple, takes few seconds and involves no risks so imo a nice damage at every failed attempt could slow down a bit the process making a player a bit more cautious (without mentioning that a ""*Player was trampled by a Horse*"" death message once in a while could bring a bit of thrill and humor in smp); **tldr** *failing to break a horse has no downside atm*

* **['It's realistic!' reason/excuse]** The horse throw you when he's annoyed so obviously he wouldn't do that in the gentlest way and maybe even kicking you in the process;

* **[Lame 'It's realistic!' excuse/excuse]** You fall from his back so you could probably suffer some kind of fall damage (it's however true that an horse is only 2 blocks high and damage till 3 blocks are negated to players).

or by having the block break on impact, taking minimal fall damage

The former means you fall uncontrollably through the tree, while the latter means one would fall on the block and take a 'hit' before it broke, making it difficult, but possible in some cases, to jump again.

Either way, it'd make the bushy floor of the jungle a little more forgiving.

They wouldn't just stand there and get killed. What would happen if they had the ability to sleep.

 For animals, sleeping will regenerate there health. Once morning is up they wake up, new and full of health. But if you attack a animal, it'll wake up and run away. The only way for animals to sleep is if they find the nearest tree or cave. If they go to the nearest tree, they sleep under the leaves, but if they go to the nearest cave, they'll sleep right at the entrance of it, pretty much where the stone begins. 

 Also, animals can mate, if they're missing someone in there pack. For example, I kill 1 out of 6 sheep in the pack. Now there is five, well. What will happen. Nothing will happen. Because that animal was killed, not died of a natural cause. The mobs get into a ""scared"" behavior, preventing them from breeding naturally. The ""scared"" behavior can be removed, if they are bred with the need of human help. The only way can they breed without human intervention, is if one of the mobs dies from drowning, falling to death, swam in a lava pit, pretty much anything natural. A natural death won't scare them, because that was the sheep's fault. I know it sounds complicated, but the new behavior system for animals can be implemented.

1361165353.0,81,self.minecraftsuggestions,18qhmc,Wearing certain heads gives certain effects.,jebediahjustice,95,14,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/18qhmc/wearing_certain_heads_gives_certain_effects/,"The heads we have now are just decor, but wouldn't it be cool if each one had little perks that went along with wearing it? Of course, the game would make it so the heads are ultra-rare drops. Here's a list of the heads and what they do.

**Creeper Head:** Gives off blast resistance when worn. Also, player is made generally quieter with footsteps, various block breaking, damage, etc. The radius for where mobs become alert to your presence is reduced by one or two blocks. Good for PVE and PVP.

**Skeleton Head:** Since skeletons are snipers, this lets you zoom in and out long distances, like a pair of wearable binoculars. I think Minecraft had this feature and took it out, but Optifine uses it. Also adds a very small power buff to arrows shot.

**Zombie Head:** Zombies take more hits than most mobs, so wearing the zombie head could be a resistance buff, also eating rotten flesh wouldn't make you hungry.

**Wither Skeleton Head:** A better resistance to the Wither effect, also a small strength buff. Basically, this takes the melee fighter's advantage and also makes it a good weapon for fighting the Wither.

**Human Head:** This would be droppable from killing someone in multiplayer as a really rare drop, but in single player, only found in dungeons, drop chests, etc OR by suicide farming. The perk here is that when you wear it and press E, the usual inventory HUD pops up, however an extra button is featured which gives an entire list of all the crafting recipes for every item when clicked, a sort of useful feature. The 2x2 crafting grid is now replaced with a 3x3 crafting square, as if you were opening a workbench. Also, there is a 10% chance that when a tool is used, it doesn't take damage points, so it's a slight unbreaking buff. Basically, this head is your Miner's/Builder's/Crafter's/Redstoner's dream.

*Heads which should be added into the game as rare drops as well-*

**Ender Heads:** A non-pumpkin blocking way of being able to look at the Endies without them getting all pissy at you. Also, you would get a permanent purple night vision when wearing. Not as strong as potion one, but good enough that it's useful and not just decor.

**Blaze Head:** Since blazes are pretty dangerous, I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to let their heads give fire resistance. Of course, fire would still damage, but less than it normal does, and lava wouldn't kill you as quickly.

**Spider Head:** Wearing one of these would give you a jump boost and increase your fall damage tolerance, so that you don't get damaged every time you jump a little higher than normal. 

**Cave Spider Head:** Less susceptible to poison damage, bit of a speed boost, and not as slowed by webs.

**Zombie Pigman:** Allows you to attack zombie pigmen without pissing off the horde, also allows you to consume rotten flesh without hunger effect and when using gold weapons/tools/armor, 75% chance that a usage won't effect the durability points.

**Slime Head:** Allows you to swim faster in water. Holding shift lets you sink faster into large bodies of water, jump button makes you go up faster, you have respiration buffs and aqua affinity slight buffing.

**Cow/Sheep/Pig/Chicken/Mooshroom Head:** Increases food saturation, so you're more satisfied and the food bar decreases slower than it usually would.

**Sounds:** Each head would make its own sound when worn and the player damaged. For example, if you are wearing a creeper head and you take damage, you make a hissing noise. If someone punches you wearing a cows head, you moo like a cow does when damaged. The human head would make the OOH noise that Steve made in previous versions of Minecraft.

*Some points-*

**But some of these heads aren't shaped like human heads! How do you expect to fit a chicken head's skin onto yours?** It's not really that hard, just make a new skin for the heads that aren't proportionate. If people who make skins can do it, it's not that hard to design a human sized Enderhead, Spiderhead, etc.

**Some of this stuff makes armor enchants and potions USELESS!** The effects these heads would give would purposefully be made so that a potion or an enchant would always give the better alternative, except for weaker versions of enchants in certain cases.

**But don't you think it makes the game too easy to have all these drops added for every mob?** All of these would have a low spawn rate, a .5% chance dropped and only activated when killed by a player, so not exactly easy to farm. Plus, the drop chance isn't affected by weapons with Fortune on them, so there's never going to be an advantage through enchanting. Endermen would only drop them in the overworld, so you couldn't farm them in the end. The human head would be dropped when a player gets killed by another player. If in single player, the human head has a .3% chance of getting dropped so farming would be a little harder since you could suicide farm. If in hardcore mode, then you just don't get to have a human head.

**What if I don't want my server's players getting powers for certain items?** A simple command for disabled head powers should suffice. Also, you could make head-specific power disablers/enabler commands in case you don't mind the Slime heads but hate Cave Spider heads, etc.

**Heads were meants to be decorative! You're taking unecessary concepts too far.** Well hey, not everyone's a builder. The game should make heads something to really desire. That way, they appeal to both the adventurer AND the architect.

Also, on a final note, depending on what you guys think, should the human head also replace the inventory GUI with a 3x3 crafting grid instead of the usual 2x2? I think that's a pretty convenient addition, but it also seems OP.

I really think movement in Minecraft could use some improvement. It's not the first thing that comes to mind, but if you actually do think about it, movement in Minecraft is extremely limited, and has been the same for a very long time. The only improvement made to movement has been sprinting, and I would personally love to see a lot more added to the game, by doing a few simple additions. I honestly think it would significantly improve the fun of playing the game, both in adventure maps with more creative parkour, and survival with simple quality of life improvements.

[Ledge grabbing.](http://i.imgur.com/snSuf.png) One thing that always bothered me is that you could only jump up one block, and you couldn't even make your way on top of one and a half blocks without a ladder, or another block. Ledge grabbing is a very simple solution to this, and also feels very freeing. I also think [this](http://i.imgur.com/04Vba.jpg) is very reasonable.

[Crawling.](http://i.imgur.com/wwxl0.jpg) Because [this](http://i.imgur.com/NbxT6.png) is just downright frustrating. It definitely looks like you should at least be able to make it through a hole like the one in the second pic. Not only that, but crawling would add a lot of secret holes and easter egg opportunities for adventure maps.

[Actual swimming!](http://i.imgur.com/ng1p4.png) Now, this is mostly cosmetic, but I honestly would love to see actual swimming instead of bobbing, and being able to go into my inventory without sinking like a stone.

And it was awesome.

So I had this idea:



**Here is how it works:**

Mob parties would have a very small chance of spawning at night or in a dark place, depending on difficulty. The game would spawn 1 mob (either a zombie or a skeleton) who is the leader. It would be identified by a *Count* Tag called *IsLeader* which would be set to 1 (true). This mob would also have 100% chance of wearing a golden helmet, and high chances of spawning with other golden armour. When a leader spawns, 5 to 7 of the same mob will spawn nearby and follow it. Any mob of the same type that comes near a leader will follow it and 'join' the party. The only times that the mobs will stop following the leader are the death of the leader or the finding of a target (player, golem, villager, etc.) I think this mechanic would make combat exiting and be interesting for mapmakers to experiment with.

Sure, they can guide a player to locate a stronghold and can open the end portal, but once those things are done the item becomes entirely useless from a gameplay perspective. 

So then there's the idea of scrying, which is a special power in which an object-usually a crystal ball-is used to view far off objects. While not entirely scrying, the idea is similar:

**Throwing an eye of ender causes it to be thrown like an enderpearl, except when it lands the camera's perpective, but not the player, is switched to the where the eye lands**. The player can then view an area more discretely without having to worry about running to that area and risking their life if it's dangerous. The camera can only turn, but not move, so it becomes a sort of fly on the wall. During this time however, the player is standing idle and is potentially vulnerable from where they threw it, so they should try to find a far off area that is safe, be protected by another player, or use an invis potion.

**Hitting the eye, having the viewer press the jump key, logging out, or killing the idle player severs the connection and destroys the eye.** Destroying the eye causes damage to the player using it equal to the amount done to the eye, so it's possible to even be killed if you don't sever the connection fast enough when spotted.

I'm thinking the risk of using the eye would be about the same as the potential pros, and it would give eyes of ender a use for exploration/recon in pvp.

**Edit**: Making them could require either enchanting them or combining normal eyes of ender with a cheap material.

Chest/Legs - Prot IV
Boots - Prot IV, Feather Falling IV
Helm - Resp III, Prot IV

The list goes on, there's clear ultimate gear, with little variance. Sure it was tried with armor and swords, but sharpness is clearly better than smite, and bane. And prot is undeniably better than fire prot/blast prot/projectile prot.

Additionally we've seen some new potions that would be awesome as enchants as well. How about wither, weakness, slowness and poison effects on swords and bows? What about invisibilty on armor that makes the armor invisible, how interesting would that be? Think I'm not armored? Oh, wait... it's diamond! True invisibility (aside from weapons) with armor on!

How about helms with night vision? Not amazing, but something cool. Boots with haste/speed/jump boost instead of protection? Sounds like a great alternative to me!

You'd have to balance these things of course. For instance invisibility on armor would not be allowed on armor with all protection, but perhaps could be with projectile/fire/blast? Obviously wither/poison/weakness/slowness would likely not be available with sharpness and power, but with fire aspect and flame? You have a pretty cool support weapon!

There's a lot more cool ideas I'd really like to see, but the above should be easier to add since they are already potion affects. The below are suggestions that would be new effects that I don't believe currently exist in game:

Critical hit multiplier, or critical hit chance increase on weapons.
Lightning strike chance on weapons.
Paralysis chance on weapons.
Gliding on boots (slow fall basically).
Block protection increase on swords.
Multi-fire on bows.
Thorns on armor.
Durability bonuses on armor.

The reason I want this is because I think the necessity of having to light up all the surfaces in a (non-peaceful) SSP world to stop mob spawning reduces the aesthetic options for building. Like in photography, “shadows” in Minecraft can be an effective way to add variation, *emphasis*, and mood to villages, roads and things like gardens and parks or even large interiors like castle halls.

Currently there is no way to do that without a bunch of mobs spawning, jeopardizing your work and your safety, and often just being a nuisance.

Half-slabs can be used to prevent mobs from spawning, but I think that is a shortcoming of the mob spawning system and may be changed in the future so that mobs will be able to spawn on those blocks as well.
