Thanks to the fiscal cliff deal tax rebates to windfarmers ends after this year! So if I want to turn my old stone silo into a windmill I better get to it if I want the rebate. But I have some questions I was hoping you guys could help me with.

1) How reliable is wind farming? I don't need it to be a great investment. Just a good one. I can't afford to be throwing money away, or I may loose the farm that I, my mom, her dad, and his dad grew up on. I know that it is a pay a lot now, get your money back over time investment. But I need to know if their are pitfalls that makes it impossible to turn a profit like if windmills require so many repairs, or if the energy company is likely to screw me (like tell me its 4 cents a thing of energy but then it turns out it is like 1/5th a cent for that same measurement of energy.) If it helps our energy company is Met Ed.

2) What are the best areas for this kind of thing?

3) What are the standard costs and payouts?

4) What are the kind of tax rebates I can expect and for just how long? (I follow politics and one of the things I saw in the Fiscal Cliff Deal is that I don't have a whole lot of time to get this started before the rebate I would make will drop)

Thank you all so much. For helping the Earth, helping me keep my beautiful family farm for my kids, and helping me realize my dream of being in the green energy game, or sparing me the heart break of failing if it turns out you guys give me over whelming reason not to try.

Technology,dirtydave71,54,15,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/RenewableEnergy/comments/13dtse/new_us_solar_chimney_to_be_twice_the_height_of/,"This is basically an enormous greenhouse that funnels hot air up the center chimney. Turbines are situated at the base of the chimney (tower) to generate electricity. These cost about the same to build on a MW basis as a coal power plant, but have a lot less moving parts/maintenance, require no water, make no pollution and don't need coal. As for reliability, the ground underneath is heated and in the event of nighttime, or cloudy days it would still generate power, as much as 70% of its daytime output.

The 50KW pilot plant that was run about 30 years ago showed this to be feasible and economical, even then. They also learned that it is an amazing place to grow things, year round. One engineering firm estimated that the agricultural output in such a situation would be worth multiples of the electricity generated.

Edit: Forgot to mention that an attempt to build one of these in Australia was snubbed by coal lobbying. Also there are alternate designs that would hypothetically cut the build cost by half or more. And these can be economically built up to about 45 degrees latitude.

Edit2: I dunno what happened to the link (I don't post much), here it is:

I am about to graduate with a phd in physics (high energy experimental) but realized around last year that abstract research was not what I want to do: I want to do something more practical and beneficial to the world (though I'm not saying high energy physics is not beneficial - its quite awesome stuff!). I was watching a lecture by jeremy rifikin about his ideas on the third industrial revolution (essentially a shift to distributed renewable energy generation on a smart grid) which got me more interested in renewables. I want in on this revolution! Of course, that may not be the direction we as a civilization are heading, but I thought working with renewables would be a step in the right direction.

Unfortunately, my field of research as a grad student was quite different from what is done in clean tech that I wasn't sure how I can enter the green industry. (My undergrad research may be a little more relevant, examining photoconductive properties of self-assembling nanowires, now they are trying to implement these as solar cells of new material). If possible, I wanted to avoid being a postdoc and settle into R&amp;D for a company or something, but I shouldn't be picky right? In fact, because of my background it may be harder to find research positions and so I was wondering what other jobs can a phd in physics do that is involved with the renewable industry?

For one, 49% of all new US electricity generation capacity came form solar, the most ever for a first quarter. Secondly, 723 MW of solar power capacity were installed and put online, again a Q1 record for the US. Let’s run down a bunch more of the facts and highlights from the Solar Energy Industries Association’s (SEIA) and GTM Research’s latest US Solar Market Insight® quarterly report.

**[US Solar Power Installation Capacity](http://crowncapitalmngt.com/)**

As you can see in the chart above, Q1 2013 was just the 4th best quarter to date for solar installation capacity. However, for various reasons, Q4 is generally the best quarter of the year and Q1 the worst, so that’s actually quite a good ranking.
Also, utility-scale projects really throw quarter-by-quarter comparisons out of wack. As SEIA writes: “As always, it is important to take the utility market out of the equation when seeking meaningful conclusions from the comparison of quarterly installation figures; the utility market is simply too volatile and dependent on individual project timelines. In that context, Q1 was quite strong in the residential market (53% year-over-year growth) and weak in the non-residential market (down 20% year-over-year). This reflects our general outlook for the year; we expect significantly stronger growth in the residential market than the non-residential market. Utility installations were down substantially from Q4 2012, but up more than 130% relative to Q1 2012. This market generally experiences a boom in the fourth quarter and we expect the same pattern to hold in 2013.”
Anyway, if you’re a fan of numbers, all in all, Q1 2013 was down 45% from Q4 2012 but up 33% from Q1 2013.
Remember that this growth is projected to continue throughout the year, with solar projected to become the #2 source of new power capacity in the US in 2013 as a whole, only behind natural gas.
In total, at the end of Q1, US solar power installation capacity stood at 7,962 MW.",,False,,t5_2ryj2,False,,,True,t3_1g96cl,http://www.reddit.com/r/RenewableEnergy/comments/1g96cl/49_percent_of_new_us_electricity_capacity_is_from/,

Secondly, I admit this only works for people who don't have AC or hate using it, like me.

Lastly, I'm also presuming you all know what a solar chimney is- an already brilliant idea utilized by ancient cultures.  I thought about making one out of plywood or tin, just because I like the idea so much- but my wife hated the idea so I dropped it.

Then I discovered why my attic seemed so abnormally hot- the soffit vents in my attic are all backed with plywood, so they don't work.  Heat was having trouble escaping, just like shotgunning a beer, if you provide an inlet as well as an outlet for heat, it can shed heat a lot more effectively and faster.

So, my problem and solution in one elegant answer: On  hot days, I open up the attic hatch, + open up the basement windows on the shady side (all other windows remain closed).  The air rises so fast it almost whistles.  It also dries out my occasionally humid basement.  God I wish I'd discovered this years ago!

Can anybody think of a reason why I SHOULDN'T do this?

edit 1-
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_chimney

for those who are asking, a solar chimney uses blackness and height to accelerate the stack effect.  Hot air rises, and as it does, creates a low pressure zone in the lower half of your house.  A house naturally does this if you let it, but taller, thinner structures do it better, especially if the top of it is dark, ie asphalt shingles.  It also works better if all the cracks and holes are well sealed.  For years I complained how stupid it was that shingles seem to all be dark.  For once I can see that it can have advantages.

Also, yes, at first the basement was spreading a musty smell, but after a day it was just like normal air, only cooler.  And yes, you have to control where the air is coming in from, that's why I specified a low, shaded window.

Edit 3- I realize also that this doesn't really belong in the renewables subreddit.  Closely related though, I think people make the connection (some like to call it ""nega-watts"")

I'm a big fan of the tiny house movement and I'm seriously considering building one (or a small cabin) and going off the grid.  I'll definitely be going solar (as well as propane and possibly wind).  I'm currently looking for land but imagine it might take me a couple years before I find the right parcel.

I just received my electric bill today, it appears to be for 323 kWh for 31 days of service.  $41.15 if you're curious as to the amount (pacific NW).

I'm curious what a system TODAY would cost that could handle this amount.  Now if I were off the grid I wouldn't be all electric, I'd be a lot of propane, but I'm just curious what my current load would cost going solar.

I do web development so my biggest electricity cost would be my computer.  Depending on how remote I am, I would be using satellite internet or possibly DSL if phone lines are near.

Also, what would a system cost today for half that load, 160 kWh.

I'm just trying to get some baseline costs of what solar costs today.",,False,,t5_2ryj2,False,,,True,t3_1hri8a,http://www.reddit.com/r/RenewableEnergy/comments/1hri8a/how_much_would_a_solar_system_cost_today_that/,

Hey there good people of Reddit. This is my project, been working on it for three years now, hoping that with your help it can reach the millions of people in the world who could use a little self built energy autonomy. Thanks.

..

The Solarflower is an open source solar energy collector which tracks the sun automatically through a simple non-electrical mechanism.

It can be made almost anywhere from common recycled and salvaged materials using basic tools and skills, is portable, has no running costs or emissions, and can produce up to kilowatts of power per device.

Depending on available resources it should take one to three unskilled people less than a week to build, and cost well under €$£ 100.

Potential examples of use could include:

~ Electrical production with simple steam turbine/piston, with waste heat going to oven or hot water system.

~ Dome oven with integrated water system for temperature regulation and hot/pasteurized water.

~ Steam distillation of water for removal of chemical, heavy metal, and biological toxins.

~ Medium to large scale food dehydration, processing, and roasting.

~ Conversion of fibrous organic waste into charcoal for energy storage and low smoke cooking, with coproduction of bio-oil and bio-gas.

~ And any other application utilizing heat.",,False,,t5_2ryj2,False,,,True,t3_10f8ss,http://www.reddit.com/r/RenewableEnergy/comments/10f8ss/solarflower_an_open_source_scrap_makeable_solar/,

I was thinking the other day and wondered why someone doesn't see this as a method of saving energy/electricity?

I realize one of the biggest draw backs (as we see with electric cars) is the method of storing the electricity generated by whatever mechanics in the car.
So seeing the car (engine compartment really) as one big thermoelectric generator would probably not be the most effecient (if easiest) method of capturing the energy.

but what about an alternate solution - storing the actual heat energy?
Filtering the radiator fluid through something (a block of ice or metal or even salt) to store the heat. Once you get home, take this block out and attach to your house to use the energy.
There are sooo many ways that energy could be used, (and my basic methods mentioned are not the actual idea's I had for it) for instance off the top of my head;
Hot water
Heating air
Cooling (evaporation cooling I think uses a source of heat.. somehow?)
As an actual thermo-electric generator, probably by direct thermocouples or something?

I mean, obviously there will be a draw-back in having to lift a theoretically stupidly hot object in/out of your car each day.
But there could be different systems in place. one that you just install in your garage/parking spot that you have a hose which you lift your bonnet (or install a socket in the radiator?) which runs fluids through to transfer the saved-up energy.

I guess that was my thoughts and wanted someone else opinion on it.
It seems to easy/obvious to me, like I'm missing something.

I mean if buildings can use it for passive heating/cooling by simply installing some fancy phase-changing materials; what kind of savings would this have? people are already buying/using the fuel. what about capturing that extra energy?",,False,,t5_2ryj2,False,,,True,t3_1fbq92,http://www.reddit.com/r/RenewableEnergy/comments/1fbq92/capturing_heat_energy_from_cars/,

I am not sure this is the right subreddit, but I am writing this post because I am very interested in entering the renewable energy business, and I was wondering if anyone had any advice on the best way to go about doing this.

After learning in depth about the global warming crisis, I realize that sustainable energy production and consumption is the most important global issue of the 21th century. As you probably already know, humanity must drastically reduce its GHG emissions over the next fifty year, starting now, by around 5% per annum. If we do not do this, then the global temperature will rise to such a degree that human civilization will no longer be possible by the middle, to the end of this century. Without being hyperbolic, as of right now, humanity is on a such a suicidal path. 

Although I have two bachelors degrees in the humanities, I now want to spend my career working in the renewable energy industry. Most any other career would be pointless, because unless we drastically reduce GHG emissions there will not be a habitable planet for my generation, or future generations to enjoy.  

To those who are in the renewable energy industry, I want to say thank you for helping to reduce GHG emissions, perhaps all is not lost just yet.

I live in the watershed of the Chesapeake Bay and the landscape is shaped by substantial waterways so I wonder why the U.S. East coast isn't investing more in Hydroelectricity.

While meandering the vast interweb, I came across an Austrian company who designed a turbine powered by a vortex of water redirected from a stream/river.  Calling it a **Gravitational Water Vortex Power Plant**,  [Zotlöterer](http://www.zotloeterer.com/welcome/gravitation-water-vortex-power-p5e95290545187f36f41dc60104091489/configuration_and_function.php) brings us an environmentally friendly and efficient means of power production.  I wanted to share this with /r/RenewableEnergy because I hadn't seen anything like it.  You don't need to dam an entire river which eliminates most problems associated with hydroelectricity. The vortex uses gravity to create a constant rotation speed, relying less on the speed of the river flow. The system takes up less space than an [Archimedes Screw](http://www.archimedeshydroscrew.com/archimedean-screw-turbine/) and is reportedly safe for fish traveling both up and down stream.  

Here is the not-so-informative [Wikipedia Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation_water_vortex_power_plant).

There are a few videos on Youtube featuring this design, but it seems to be relatively new. I can't find any examples in the U.S.

[Something that looks similar in Australia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPIWSVhVHL0) and their Youtube channel, [Kourispower](http://www.youtube.com/user/kourispower/videos?view=0&amp;flow=grid), has more.
