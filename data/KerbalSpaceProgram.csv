I believe this comes from a misunderstanding of reddit.

Reddit is not the same as a forum. Threads and posts inside those threads are not ordered linearly and chronologically. Instead, at least in theory anyway, they are ordered by a mix of freshness and how much worth the community assigns.

If your question is something a lot of people have also been wondering there's a good chance they will upvote your question. **The cool thing about that is then lots of people see the question and the answer to something that's either important, not well known, or confusing.**

Saying ""please don't upvote"" just undoes this. You're preventing other people from potentially seeing something useful, and you're also probably stopping your question from being seen by someone who can answer it really well. Are you worried about getting karma unfairly? Well that's just silly because

1. No one cares about other people getting karma for useful content
2. You're supposed to get karma for things the community likes or thinks are important.
3. You don't even get karma for self (text-only) posts anyway.

Disclaimer: I hope the above doesn't come off as question bashing, because it's actually the opposite. Additionally, if you read this and still for whatever silly reason still think it's bad to ask questions here (which has never been the opinion of anyone who decides anything here), [there's the new /r/KerbalAcademy subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1jfkay/introducing_rkerbalacademy_a_place_for_indepth/). /r/KerbalAcademy is an awesome initiative and I'd recommend it to anyone that likes helping others out with their rocket science or who has lots of questions to ask.","10,000 ships rapidly disassemble when you say ""don't upvote"" ",False,self,t5_2smr1,1375547980.0,,ksp,True,t3_1jmr3s,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1jmr3s/psa_please_dont_upvote_or_defeating_the_point_of/,

*****

**""What is Kerbal Academy?""**

/r/KerbalAcademy is a place where beginners and pros alike may seek answers to their questions related to KSP. Whether you want to talk about techniques for flying, how to get to the Mun, or the specifics of orbital mechanics - this is the place. We want to bring those with questions and those who want to answer them together.

*****

**""Why not just use /r/KerbalSpaceProgram?""**

/r/KerbalSpaceProgram is terrific. The community is growing rapidly, and as it has, the types of posts have changed towards more achievement based Imgur links. **Currently, 21 of the top 25 posts are from Imgur.** It represents a growing trend, and nothing against them, but we want a place that is more focused on the teaching and learning aspect.

*****

**""How is it different?""**

/r/KerbalAcademy will be text-post only. That way, discussion will be encouraged and won't be lost. We aren't expecting to have multiple thousands of subscribers, but rather a core group dedicated to helping those learning the game (or diving deeper) have an amazingly rich experience.

*****

**""But you are fragmenting the subreddit!""**

We put serious thought into this. It is never our goal to separate the people, instead to provide a safe place for questions where people are interested in getting and giving answers. Think of this as the TrueGaming vs Gaming - one does not take away from the other, but rather complements and provides an outlet for discussion without getting lost in the commotion of gaming.

*****

It is our hope that people subscribe to both, not one or the other, and /r/KerbalSpaceProgram will always be the home and entrance portal for KSP on Reddit.

I can't be the only one who is perfectly OK with how they are developing, especially given the recent weekly updates. I've been with this game since .8.5, and never before has the community been so hostile. Sure, Squad has had some difficulties in recent times, but overall I am quite happy. While people have always been clamoring for release dates and much-demanded features, it's reached a new high. It may just be a result of the community's new size, but it is still disturbing to see this much negativity directed at them. The features that were 'promised' to the community have been long in the planning, is that they are later so bad, especially considering other games with similar situations. Take Minecraft for example. It is just now getting horses, which there has been both demands for and mods for years. Mod API is another 'promised' feature not yet implemented there as well, yet the level of hostility is not nearly as high. I apologize if this has turned into somewhat of a rant, but I felt it had to be said. I love Squad and their game, and wish them the best of luck. I hope the community can accept what they are, because they can't please everyone, though I think they've made a marvelous attempt.

I want to thank not only the developers, but also every moder and player of KSP.  It is truly an amazing game.  It makes me so glad that so many people are behind this game.  You have no idea how many times I've heard from people ""Why is space important anymore"", and its just so hard to convey my sense that its just so incredibly awesome to promote exploring the most dangerous and final frontier we know of...  I for one find that in itself enough of a reason to keep going to space on ridiculous missions.  What the KSP community has shown me is that people do really find it fascinating, the sense of ""Lets do it because... we're us"" is awesome even tho its just a video game... I mean, you could spend your free time on other finished video games winning achievements to gloat to your friends about, but instead you spend countless hours devoted to trying to solve a problem in a unique way, with really no reward other than to say ""Look what I did"" even if its only to yourself.  I am not sure if thats at all everyone, but thats what I do.

Trust me, this game has most of the stuff right on (although simplified obviously), but every one of my former fellow Aerospace Engineering students who I introduce to the game just say ""This game is amazing... I spent 20 hours on it last weekend"".  How I hook my fellow engineers is with this: ""KSP is kinda like porn for us Aerospace Engineers... watching porn is easier than going out and finding a girl that is willing to hook up with you.  Porn might not be as ultimately rewarding, but it sure as hell requires a lot less effort and is still fun as f#$k.""

Just wanted to say thanks from the Engineering community.

1365719228.0,382,self.KerbalSpaceProgram,1c5zmi,"Official Statement on Expansions, DLC and the future of KSP",,434,52,206,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1c5zmi/official_statement_on_expansions_dlc_and_the/,"Hello everyone.

We've been following closely the ongoing debate about Expansion Packs and DLC on KSP, and after [Felipe's previous explanation](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entry.php/634-About-DLC-and-Expansions-for-KSP) about the things that sparked the discussion, we've noticed that there are still a few areas that were left pending and that require an explanation:

Above all, is the admittedly quite grey area concerning what constitutes an update or an expansion to KSP and most importantly, what our promise of ""all future updates for free"" actually means.

We realize there is more than one way to interpret that. Regardless of whether 'updates' implies 'expansions' or not, it's quite obvious now that we need to rephrase that statement so everyone knows exactly what they're getting when they purchase the game.

However, it became clear to us that many might have already taken that statement to mean something else than we did when they bought the game, and so had a different notion of what it was they were getting with their initial purchase.

So given that this was a point of confusion, and that we believe that no matter what, a promise is a promise, we are including Expansions in what you can expect to get for free if you have already bought the game. Also, for those considering purchasing the game, we will maintain this promise for all purchases made until the end of this month (April, 2013).

We have to admit though, up until now, we hadn't considered Expansion Packs to be the same as updates to KSP. That was in large part because we really had no plans for actual expansions at all.

But as you can imagine, over the course of the 2 and a half years we've been developing KSP, we've come across many ideas that we thought were very cool, but didn't really fit the original scope of the game. Those would have led us astray from our vision of the complete game, not to mention that they could take many months, if not years, to implement.

Those ideas are massive undertakings, which is why we'd like to have them as optional additions, so we could have them without having to stretch the scope (and deadlines) for the main game.

So this is what we mean when we say Expansion Packs for KSP. We're not talking about small content bundles, we're talking about major game-changing sets of features, like Multiplayer, or Colonization. Things that add not just content, but new gameplay possibilities. Things that might not fit the initial concept very well, but we think are too cool to just cut off forever.

Please keep in mind though, that this isn't us announcing or promising any particular Expansion Packs yet. We're still quite a long way from that. Our one focus right now is to complete KSP, that is why career mode is the priority now. Once we get to what we can call a complete game, we'll see where we go next from there.

We hope that this clears away all of the confusion surrounding this topic, and also that no one is left with the impression that we would ever do anything to upset our players. We take pride in being very open and honest about what we do and how we do it, and we all felt very hurt at some of the accusations that were thrown at us these last few days.

Above all else, our goal is to make an outstanding game, and we sincerely hope everyone sees that we have nothing but the best intentions towards our work and our community. As always, we will be listening wholeheartedly to our community's feedback, concerns and ideas throughout this whole process and we will not slack off.

Here's a big thanks to everyone for all the continued support, and a heartfelt apology to all those who felt wronged in any way over this matter.

Sincerely,

As we rapidly approach 50,000 subscribers, I think it is time we discussed the quality of the subreddit. 

Let me take a second to say that I have actively browsed this sub for about 2 years, and have moderated for 1 year. In my honest opinion, the quality of the subreddit has not dived to the degree that some suggest it has.

However, it has come to my attention that some users think that this sub is headed in the direction of /r/minecraft, and that the quality seen here today has suffered completely. 

As one of only 4 active, non-robotic moderators of this subreddit, I feel personally responsible for the quality of this subreddit. However, none of us are able to personally judge what is best for the future of the subreddit as we grow into the 50,000 subs range. With this having been said, we'd like to ask for your opinion.

What do you [the readers] not like about this subreddit as it stands? I see plenty of rants in threads about the quality of the sub, but rarely do I see specific issues pointed out or solutions offered.

Leave comments here about what could be changed from a moderation standpoint in order to improve the quality of the subreddit. We will not stand idly by while the subreddit falls apart!

Few other games like Minecraft released to the public with nothing but a concept and users with creative minds all over the world express their creativity and imagination through it and it shine. 

What you guys are doing is not only for the creative minds, but also the intelligence and the curious. There are many people out there that  have such imaginative minds fueled with curiosity but wanting more than just pictures and videos off the internet. KSP have allowed many people to play along, express their ideas and see it come to life infront of their screen. It has just enough simplicity, and complexity to let the new player mess around and have fun, but allow the experience to try their wildest idea to explore space.

I have only played the demo for an hour, with my limited time (and money) only allow, but the first time i succeed to hit orbital, it put a big smile in my face and seeing my successful re-entree made me even happier. 

I will be buying KSP once i have the money (i refused to pirate) and i am looking forward to countless hours of rocket building!

Thank you KSP developers to make such great game, and prove that video games is not just guns, violence, and nudity. You have prove that video games can be smart and be useful as a learning tool. or atleast a tool to excite youngsters and boost their dreams to reach the universe in our small world.

So every morning and most evenings I build a rocket for him and let him launch it. He gets so excited about launching the rocket that his entire body shakes. He then points at it chatters and makes rocket noises as it launches. If the rocket is off balance he will go ""uhh ohh.. explode?"". But he loves it when they actually do explode. 

I have been teaching him how to separate and fire the stages too. But as soon as we begin the orbital maneuvers he gets bored and wanders off to play with his toys.

He is learning numbers this way. He has a little dart shooter happy meal toy. He holds it in the air and counts down""3..2..1.."" (and sometimes ""7..4..9""), then yells ""rocket BOOM"", and launches it. Usually at my head.

He does the same thing with shampoo bottles in the bath. Making them launch out of the water, and saying ""rocket fly up"". Which is pretty much the most complicated sentence he has ever made.

He loves the Kerbals themselves. He puts on a helmet and runs around the house claiming he is a Kerbal, which he pronounces, ""Keh bow"".

[Resources flow chart](http://i.imgur.com/lGlWdyn.png) (Note: this version is out of date)

* [Thought previous version of system had way too many resource processing parts with overly specialized functions, so added parts that can process multiple resources](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1bqbce/new_resource_part_from_nova/c99cbw1)
 - A chemical plant that can process resources into liquid fuel/oxidizer
 - A workshop that can process resources into parts
 - More advanced parts will be heavier, have higher power requirements and may require a crew to operate
* No distinction between solid/liquid/gas resources (e.g. water harvested from a pump, or condensed from the air, or mined ice at polar caps all goes to the same place)
* Persistent resources (can be depleted) although they will last a very, very long time
* Resource locations randomly generated in each save
* Rovers on the ground will be much more useful for resource mapping than probes in orbit (Don't want it to work like ISA Mapsat where you just put a probe in orbit and time warp until you have a full map.  Wants the player to really work to get the map)

* Spaceplane cockpits will come later when spaceplanes get an art pass
* Might add a functional IVA docking camera

Career mode (want to begin implementation in 0.21)

* Will get a list of missions that “kerbal-kind” want to see you achieve
 - Will get contracts for future missions based on achievements
* Research and development tree
 - Branches can be unlocked via achievements/milestones (e.g. landing a probe on Duna)
* Persistent kerbonauts (may be able to execute certain missions on their own if experienced enough)
 - [Will need to keep alive with life support](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1bqbce/new_resource_part_from_nova/c99ck9i)
* Will eventually need to discover the planets (won’t automatically appear on the map view by default)
* Full rebuild of space center
 - Including mission control center
 - Space center may be able to be damaged/repaired

More kerbal animations (probably not for 0.20)

Struggling with stability? Are you struggling just to get airbourne? **This is the guide for you.**

**There will be no inlet stacking, part clipping, and stock parts only. No mods are used.**

**Also, The screenshots look like I took them with a potato. That's Macbooks for you.**

**BASIC PRINCIPLES OF FLIGHT**

Firstly, we shall take a very brief look at how aircraft actually work. This image will quickly explain forces at play in normal, balanced flight.

[Conventional Aircraft Model](http://i.imgur.com/Y777sF5.png)

Lets break this down.

**Thrust = Drag**

To maintain a steady velocity (we shall call this airspeed from now on). Our forward thrust must equal the drag on the aircraft. On earth, this is broken down into *profile* drag (drag produced by the air ""hitting"" the aircraft) and *incipient* drag (drag caused by the production of lift while in-atmosphere). In KSP, the drag model is vastly simplified, and AFAIK is a function of air density and aircraft weight. Lets keep it simple, **in KSP, your drag(for a given speed) will reduce as altitude increases**. This simplifies a lot of our design, but does add some other issues. So thrust is simple - We just need enough thrust to overcome our current drag. Fortunately for us, Jet's produce more thrust at higher speed, which is when we will experience more drag.

*Keep in mind, all kinds of drag are irrelevant once we get above 70km, because our profile drag is effectively zero (no air to ""hit"" the aircraft), and our incipient drag is zero (wings will not produce lift in a vacuum, so therefore no drag is produced either)

**Wing Lift = Weight + tailplane force**

Imagine the aircraft as a seesaw. The centre of the seesaw is the Centre of Gravity, this point in the aircraft can be defined as the ""point at which the mass of the aircraft acts through"". The aircraft is being pulled down from gravity at this point. In the ideal world, the wing would also act through this exact point. However, the CoG will move throughout the flight (as we use fuel for example), so the solution is to ensure the aircraft is being pushed up at a point **behind the CoG** . We call this point the Centre of Pressure (or lift). This is important. Doing this allows us to use a tailplane like a counterweight, producing a variable downwards force to keep our seesaw in balance. To make this effective, we place the tail back as far as possible, to give it a large moment.
**90% of stability issues are caused by incorrect mass and balancing. Remember that KSP will take fuel from the front and work backwards. Once the CoG is BEHIND the CoP your aircraft will become unstable.

**NOW LET'S BUILD SOME F@£?KING PLANES**

I here, have a nice simple plane to build. Lets look at some of the details.

[Simple KSP Aircraft](http://i.imgur.com/9GIrKxZ.jpg)

Look at the CoG positioning. It's well in front of the CoP, giving our aircraft good stability. However, we would also like to do other things, so we have put control surfaces on the wings, which we will call **ailerons** . These will **roll the aircraft** . These do not need to be large in KSP as the drag model doesn't model wing drag correctly.  And on the tail, the tailplane section which will produce our downwards tail force is called the **elevator** . This is to keep the aircraft at the correct angle of attack. We also put a vertical fin on there, to allow the aircraft to yaw and keep it directionally stable. We call this the **rudder**. One more important note:-

[Wheel Postioning](http://i.imgur.com/05CmSKt.jpg)

You notice how the main wheels are located behind the CoG? This is to make sure it stays on 3 wheels. However, we don't want it too far back - if so, it will be very difficult to pitch the aircraft on the ground for takeoff.

ALSO lets talk **jet engines**.

Jet engines don't work quite like they do in kerbal. But suffice to say, for a normal aircraft, one intake per engine is fine. When we get to SSTO Aircraft, we will look again at intakes.

The Avionics packaged is postioned on top by adding the small square strut and placing it on top of that. No hacks needed.

**NOW LETS FLY STUFF**

Your brave kerbal jumps in. First things first **enable precision control** . It's set as Caps Lock, and the controls in the bottom left turn blue. TRIMMING IS IMPORTANT. Unless you want to be hovering over ASAS all the time, learn to trim. push ALT/MOD + WASD to trim. We will only be trimming in pitch. In the example, I've trimmed nose UP by 1 ""tick"". This is how almost all my aircraft will fly.

[Runway Setup](http://i.imgur.com/mwjBKbA.jpg)

Punch it up to full, hit the spacebar and let the aircraft accelerate. Jet engines have to spool, it will take a few seconds for the engine to respond to the throttle. It will almost take of by itself, but give it a little help with some upwards pitch at about 70m/s.

If the aircraft won't fly level hands off. use the trim to set the pitch. In real flying, we use pitch to control speed, and power to control height. However in kerbal, you have lots of extra thrust to play with, so just use the pitch to control height, and power to control speed.

To keep turns level, use your angle of bank to stay level.

Too much bank:-
http://i.imgur.com/ZYneZSt.jpg

Not enough bank:- http://i.imgur.com/ukeD5Ul.jpg

Just right:-http://i.imgur.com/m7fDfNK.jpg

Go have fun, get used to flying, you should only need SAS if you want to make a cup of tea or whatever.

Sorted? Good. Landing is simple, set a nose up attitude, and reduce power until you touchdown. Landing is a guide in itself. But I'll answer any issues in the comments.

**BUT SUBHUMANN, ALL THE PLANES IN KSP HAVE THE TAIL BIT AT THE FRONT SO WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?**

You will find the part selection is pushing towards a different type of aircraft design. **canards** .

**CANARD/DELTA WING DESIGN**

Canards work differently:-

[Basic Canard Principle](http://i.imgur.com/7Wfykzn.png)

The seesaw is different now, now our seesaw pivot is on the back of the aeroplane, and the weight and tailplane are both acting upwards. Canards are slightly more efficient for it, and also have some aerodynamic advantages beyond the scope of this guide. They are also more maneuverable, again for reasons beyond this guide.

So lets build a canard.

[Canard Design](http://i.imgur.com/QQubt7O.jpg)

Same principles as before, just now our wings are further back and our tail is now as far forward as we can get it. Nothing game changing. The advantage also for us, is that with no tailplane at the back, engine placement is easier.

**FLYING THE CANARD**

http://i.imgur.com/7964AtV.jpg

Different toilets, same shit.

http://i.imgur.com/gixBorl.jpg

*Mandatory Top Gun comment here*

You will find the canard much more eager to turn in pitch, and might ""bob"" in pitch, this i THINK is the canards reaching critical AoA, but I am not sure. Suffice to say you can pitch hard and I haven't managed to stall the canards yet.

**BUT SUBHUMANN, I BOUGHT THIS GAME TO GO TO SPACE!! DO YOU EVEN SPACE  BRO?**

Why yes, yes I do.

**Non-Atmospheric Flight (SSTO)**

Now, we need to look at the engines again.  To save you the hassle of trial and error, you will need **FOUR** ramjet intakes per turbojet engine for a successful SSTO. More inlets, you can climb higher on jets only. Less, you will need more rockets to finalise.

P.S - ensure your rockets are inline with your CoG. Otherwise you aircraft will pitch wildly, and with no air, your control surfaces will not work.

P.P.S **In space, the Avionics package is about as much use as tits on a nun. You have been warned.** Fit ASAS on your SSTO. 


EDIT: P.P.P.S **In 0.21, ASAS is much improved, you can basically use ASAS for all SSTO and leave it on at all times**

BEHOLD!

[SSTO KSP DESIGN](http://i.imgur.com/j0xTHlL.jpg)

Same idea, only now we have two rockets. And to carry all the extra weight. MOAR WINGS.

Now your probably asking ""Where is your canards?"". This is a Delta Wing design. We have increased our aileron size, allowing use to combine our aileron and elevator, draw the aircraft out, and the pitching from the controls will balance our weight. This has the result of much larger pitch trim position.

Also, you will need a custom action:-

[Custom Action Setup](http://i.imgur.com/JoYXrw4.jpg)

This allows us to instantly light the rockets the moment the jets die, I will tell you when you do this.

Now takeoff as normal, and set a decent climb angle:-

http://i.imgur.com/p8GGy5W.jpg

We will follow a profile like this:-

[SSTO Ascent Profile](http://i.imgur.com/jGvFl1t.png)

Get this dialed in your head, just like your conventional gravity turn profile.

Once we get to 10000m+ Our inlet air will decrease, and we will reduce pitch and increase speed-

**Is your aircraft backflipping at this point?**

As your fuel burns, your CoG will move back. If it moves back beyond the CoG, your aircraft will become unstable in pitch and start to backflip/frontflip. To alleviate this, you can xfer fuel manually by Alt + clicking the fuel tanks in question. If this doesn't work, you need to go back to your design again.

[In-Flight Weight and Balance ](http://i.imgur.com/Dq4junS.jpg)

**Above 10km, check your resources, once your inlet air reduces below 0.20ish. Punch that custom command we setup earlier**  and CAREFULLY pitch 45 deg up. i say CAREFULLY as you are probably trimmed quite nose high, so either use ASAS or untrim before this step.

Punch for your apoapsis:-

http://i.imgur.com/AUhI3oN.jpg

Then circularise as your conventional rockets do.

http://i.imgur.com/FF0eQRU.jpg

And there you have it! Successful SSTO launch.

[Greetings, from LKO!](http://i.imgur.com/XQ97txb.jpg)

 To Deorbit, just burn retrogade. As you do with a normal rocket.

http://i.imgur.com/PEcptPK.jpg

Fire is pretty.

*I will admit, I wasn't really paying attention on the deorbit, and may have landed at night in the sea. Suffice to say, the lil kerbal survived*.

As you might know, there are standardized naming conventions for naval vessels in the real world (for example, U.S. fast attack submarines are named after cities, while boomers are named after states). They also come with a unique hull classification number, e.g., USS *Tennessee* (SSBN-734) is a **S**hip, **S**ubmersible, **B**allistic missile carrying, **N**uclear powered boat. 

Anyways, I came up with some naming conventions for my Kerbal spacecraft, and thought I'd share.  It helps me keep track of ship designs in a way that's meaningful and descriptive.

**Take-off Method**

V — Vertical take-off

H — Horizontal take-off


**Mission**

T — Unmanned satellite — satellites shall be named after insects

R — Unmanned robotic lander — landers shall be named after small mammals and reptiles

O — Manned orbiter — orbiters shall be named after Slavic deities

C — Cargo — cargo vessels shall be named after large land mammals

E — Manned extra-planetary mission — manned expeditions shall be named after sea birds

L — Space station/laboratory — stations shall be named after mountain ranges

M — Military/armed vessel — military vessels shall be named after war heroes


**Engine Type**

L — Liquid only

K — Liquid primary, solid booster

N — Nuclear (liquid/solid fuel boosters)

I — Xenon/Ion drive

So my first successful satellite delivery vehicle was named VTK-01 *Gnat*.

I'd heard its name tossed around a few places and figured what the hell, why not? I hadn't messed with it at all until last night when I fired it up instead of SimCity 4.

I start goofing around with little to no clue what I'm doing. My first rocket was a capsule directly on top of an SRB. With predictable results. So with some more puttering I learn about decouplers and parachutes and my second rocket doesn't go very far, but my Kerb survives so I call that a net win. Some more messing around, I start to get some decent altitude and I make getting my Kerb back alive routine. I try stacking a decoupler under the first stage engine nozzle and figure out how to stage a rocket. This is also the time I decided to try liquid fuel engines. This is not the time I learn how to throttle a liquid fuel engine. I manage to stage after SRB burn out and then turn my fuel tank into a bomb as I can't figure out how to start the engine. The pod decoupled just fine.

Well I find out how to throttle a liquid engine and figure I'm going for it this time. Stack up a couple fuel tanks, put on an engine and... the rocket goes nowhere. Ok, that's not entirely fair, with full thrust and some patience it gets about 20m in altitude, leans slightly and blows up against the gantry. Funny enough my command capsule winds up laying on top of the gantry with my Kerb alive. Net win. So I try out the radial decoupler and strap four SRB's to my rocket figuring that should get it's fat ass off the ground. It does, spectacularly, but then I figure I'll light my liquid fuel engine off before SRB sep so there's no delay. I wind up decoupling my SRB's while they're only half through with their burn, then go wild and smash into my rocket and... well lets say there was no body left to bury.

More experiments, more staging, a few more... less than spectacular flights but soon I've got a handle on this. I'm flying long enough to start to learn about rocket control and how having some isn't bad as I launch a series of pinwheels into the lower atmosphere. I'm getting quite adept at rapidly punching out my pilots though so no more Kerb-widows. Adding winglets doesn't help much as I haven't learned to fly a rocket yet, but with more control surface and a gimballing engine you can really make a rocket tumble.

I find the SAS and read up on it. Things get better, my rockets are flying and I manage to get one to 45km and get my kerb back. I'm feeling better. Then I read up on the ASAS. I go nuts, eight RCS clusters, four fins on my rocket, another one on each booster. It works, it flies straight... it won't turn and roll over. More rockets, more up and down, no flying into orbit. So I turn the ASAS off once I get some altitude. Pinwheel. Try again, tumbling pinwheel. Third time's a charm? Cartwheel with a half gainer. However I am learning, and things get a little better.

Finally, I feel like I might be ready for it. So I build my biggest rocket yet. Parachute, command capsule, ASAS, RCS fuel tank, four RCS clusters (thanks snap-to-angle and symmetry buttons!), decoupler, short fuel tank, smallest engine, decoupler, three long fuel tanks, three radial decouplers, three fins, gimballing engine. I strap on three boosters made of a nose cone, two long fuel tanks, one fin, and the big non-gimballing engine. I'm ready to fly. Go to the pad, hit the throttle, and watch as all three boosters pitch in towards the central core but  nothing explodes. Awesome! I clipped a fin on the gantry, death spiraled and died. Less awesome. Back to the VAB, move the decouplers up, twist the boosters about ninety degrees and back to the pad.

I launch and things... this thing barely wants to go. Even at full throttle it's barely accelerating. I clear the gantry though and am gaining altitude so I figure I'm going for it. Boosters run out and I cut them loose. My main engine has a heck of a time pushing this huge stack but it still manages to keep me accelerating. I pass 50 kilometers and figure it's time to cut the ASAS loose and fly this thing. I pitch over and it goes ok. I manage to stabilize my flight path about 30 degrees above the horizon and figure I'll call that good enough. ASAS back on. I check the map, my flight path is ever growing longer but I also notice I'm really in a huge arc. I briefly consider fine tuning my flight path but figure I've got plenty of gas, I'll ride this thing into orbit (I hope) and fine tune later. The important part is getting into orbit and I rejoice when my flight path goes from an arc to a really distended ellipsis. I keep thrusting but notice my periapsis is at about 40km. That's not orbit, that's reentry. And my main cut out. So I dump the empty stage and push on with my small command module engine. It works. Pretty soon my periapsis is at 90km. Mind you my apoapsis is 2,880km but fuck it, that's an orbit. An ugly, seriously off angled orbit but orbit nonetheless. I figure I can circularize it though, or at least make it a little less awful looking and I focus on getting my CM oriented for a circularization burn at apoapsis. A little time warp and I'm there. I get ready to throttle up and...

I hit the spacebar.

I instantly understand what I've done and regret it as I watch my CM's service module with 1/2 it's fuel left and my main engine drift away. I've done it. I managed to put Bill Kerman into orbit then promptly stranded him there. I'm about to abort the flight in disgust when I spy the RCS thrusters on the side of my capsule. At this point what have I really got to lose? So I again fight to get the capsule reoriented learning to fly all over again, this time in RCS mode with nothing but a tiny capsule to push around. After a lot of spinning and tumbling I'm pointed opposite my flight path and the retrograde mark in the nav ball is relatively close to where I'm aimed so I flip on my ASAS and hold H. To my shock my orbit starts to change relatively quickly given that all I've got are four RCS clusters. If I was a better pilot or more thinking about what I was doing I might have stopped when my orbit lowered enough to graze the atmosphere and done some aerobraking. Nope, Bill was coming home and I held H until my orbital path intersected the ground.

So I go through reentry, deploy my parachute (getting back on H in a desperate attempt to slow myself as much as possible and not kill Bill anyways due to a chute malfunction) and land. Bill Kerman back on the ground, alive and able to stand beside his capsule proudly. After the fact I realized I hadn't actually completed an orbit in my blind panic to get Bill back alive but fuck it, I established a stable orbit and got my Kerb back home alive. I look at my clock and realize I've been at this one launch for almost an hour and it's way late but of everything I've done today getting that minion look a like back on the ground alive was probably my proudest.

I immediately bought the damn game.

EDIT: I am currently playing again and got a MUCH improved rocket design into space first try. Equatorial orbit, 653 x 242 km. Jeb is loving it and took a celebratory spacewalk.

It is a pleasure to meet you all. My screen name is PD and I am the new Media Director at Squad. You can see the official posts on the facebook and twitter feeds along with the forums. At any rate I wanted to introduce myself to you guys. I'm typically not very big into the whole 'forum' type deal, but i figured now is a good time to get more active.

I wanted to tell you guys how I got started at squad but we have to rewind to about 1 year ago. I started making YouTube videos and eventually bought and started recording KSP videos. I was recruited by former Community Manager DamionRayne to the volunteer KSP media group a few months later in the beginning of the fall season, sometime around september / october 2012 although I don't remember the exact date. There we produced videos that would eventually lead into us getting featured on the KSP Home Page for gameplay and we did videos on .18 a few days before it went live. A few months ago i started writing the KSP Weekly News article because it had not been continued after Damion's parting from the company. A few weeks after that started PR Manager 'Maxmaps' was hired and that gave me the opportunity to work a little bit closer with the devs. I eventually convinced him that weekly developer updates describing the work they had done for the week would be a good idea and he pushed it through management. Behind the scenes I did a lot of work organizing and keeping the media group and KSPtv guys rounded up as Community Manager 'Captn Skunky's' right hand.

Long story short my hard work and dedication to the game and company had not gone unnoticed and that led to me becoming the new Media Director and Ted becoming QA Lead. 

Just goes to show you that you can make dreams come true with enough hard work and dedication to what you love.

About one week ago I was offered the job I now currently have and that was right around the same time as my one year YouTube anniversary of making Kerbal Space Program videos. The day I was hired i released this little video. I'd really like to know what you think of it.

At any rate it is nice to meet you all here at the reddit community and I hope to be a more active part of this whole forum thing in the future.

Cheers,

1374976680.0,258,self.KerbalSpaceProgram,1j6zx7,PSA: 10 ways to avoid headache as a newer player.,arksien,297,39,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1j6zx7/psa_10_ways_to_avoid_headache_as_a_newer_player/,"Hello all! So I've only been a part of the community for a few weeks now, but I've spend a rather disproportionate amount of my time playing this game since discovering it. Anyhow, I thought I'd post a list of ""lessons learned the hard way"" or ""easy tricks to avoid frustrating situations"" that I've encountered over the last few weeks. A lot of these are likely common knowledge, or possibly even in tutorials, but damn if I didn't know about any of this list before finally stumbling upon it after it would have been useful. 

**1) There is a quick save and quick load. F5 quicksaves, F9 quick loads.**

You can quick save when you are stopped on the ground, or once you are above ""orbital"" altitude. I've learned that on Kerbin, this is 70,000 meters, even though it will say ""orbit"" before you get there.

**2) You can rearrange stages while in flight!**

I REALLY wish I had known this very obvious fact before I scrubbed a mission that was AT DUNA because I put my parachutes in the wrong order... you can move things around any time. It makes perfect sense that you can, and I don't know why I assumed you couldn't, but if you didn't know that before, now you do!

**3) Your Kerbals have jetpacks when they are on EVA. Push 'R' to toggle it on and off.**

I definitely killed a few kerbals early on by putting them on permanent orbit before learning this... 

**4) You can repack parachutes and fix broken rover wheels with your kerbals when they are on EVA if they are close enough to the object.**

Again, many joyrides ended with a long walk back to the lander before I learned this, and I used to put extra chutes on if I intended multiple landings.

**5) Pushing G lowers all landing legs at once**

I definitely was right clicking all of them individually before learning this.

**6) Pushing U turns all lights on/off**

This one I actually figured out pretty early on, but my very first time using landing lights still involved me clicking each one.

**7) You can select your intended docking port as your target to make docking easier if your station has multiple docking ports.**

Docking is still a PITA, but it was worse for me when I was eyeballing the final docking approach without realizing I could zero in on my exact destination on the nav-ball.

**8) You can toggle through all nearby objects by pushing [ and ]**

This is how you send more than one kerbal on an EVA at at time. I knew you could do it, because I saw pictures, but I had to go looking to figure out how.

**9) You can clean up all your debris, which will reduce lag**

Go to the tracking station at KSC, switch the filter to ""debris,"" then hit ""terminate flight."" A lot of my lag issue went away after I learned this.

**10) You can lock stages by pressing ALT + L**

Yup, can't tell you how man accidental spacebar taps it took me to learn that there's a preventative measure.

And there you have it! 10 things I wish I had known earlier on, learning the hard way every time. There's plenty enough lessons to learn the hard way in this game while playing correctly, it's nice to know about these little features! Hope this helps at least someone.",,False,self,t5_2smr1,False,,kerbal,True,t3_1j6zx7,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1j6zx7/psa_10_ways_to_avoid_headache_as_a_newer_player/,

So, we finally have our Forums and SpacePort back up. However, these good tidings come with some unfortunate ones. Here's what happened:

Last week, the server that hosts SpacePort and the KSP Forums started getting slower and slower until the sites were pretty much unusable. We eventually had to shut it down, but by that time the damage was done. The slowness was coming from an excessively high number of idle connections, which may or may not have been related to a global denial-of-service attack that affected thousands of sites last week. Whether or not that was actually the case for us is hard to tell, but in any case, the end result was that we ended up with a server so broken, it needed to be wiped out completely and reinstalled from scratch.

We keep regular backups of all our databases, exactly for situations such as this. Spaceport was restored just fine. However, due to a fault in our backup process that went largely unnoticed until now, the most recent snapshots we had for the Forums were partially corrupted or incomplete.

We've been able to get the Forums back up, but on some areas of the database, we were forced to revert to older backups, in some cases reaching as far back as October. This means that unfortunately there's been some data loss, mainly affecting threads and most grievously, user accounts.

If your account dates from before October last year, you should be fine. However, if you created your account recently, there's a good chance it will be missing, in which case you'll have to re-create it.

Rest assured though, this does not in any way affect your Store account. Those live on a separate database on a separate server, and they're perfectly fine, so your store profile is safe. This issue only affects forum accounts.

Regardless, we are aware this is big a setback for a lot of people, and we sincerely apologize for it. Despite all our efforts, there was nothing we could do to get all the data back. We're still working hard on getting everything we can salvage from the partial backups we have though, so we can bring back as much content as possible.

Needless to say, we're setting up a new, much more robust backup system, to make sure this never happens again. We are also adding in new security systems to minimize damage from attacks like that as much as possible.

Once again, we deeply apologize for the inconvenience.

Sincerely,

-- The KSP Dev Team",,False,self,t5_2smr1,False,,,True,t3_1cmv1x,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1cmv1x/ksp_forums_and_spaceport_are_back_up_important/,

As with any game that has a dedicated, experienced fanbase, the addition of so many 'noobs' was met with some hostility, the details of which I'm not going to get into because I'm sure most of you remember it.

What I've noticed since then is truly fantastic. I get a kick from learning a new thing, the prospect of discovery in any walk of life excites me, which is probably why I'm a physicist. But I think I get a bigger thrill from seeing other people do the same thing, seeing the moment of realisation as something clicks in another person's head is a truly wonderful moment to watch. This subreddit is full of those moments. The comment threads and associated posts are areas of proud achievement, sudden realisation, and gleeful aspiration all rolled into one, and since the steam release, the achievements have just been getting more and more impressive.

I am seeing more landings on Jool's moons and proper bases on other planets than ever before, and I think (I hope) this is because people are getting better at the game, rather than being turned off the subreddit by the experts.

Watching so many people discover so much about the game has been truly wonderful for me, and unlike other games, I've also been watching people learn physics. If I were to say 'we have a satellite in an elliptical orbit and we need it in a circular one' I'm sure many of you would be able to tell me roughly the direction in which I should fire the thrusters. I'm sure that from playing around with Kerbals in orbit, you have a better intuition for momentum than you did before, that various failed launches have exhibited the trade-off between power and efficiency, and that strapping more rockets on doesn't always make the thing go faster/further.

OK so many of you wouldn't be able to do the maths and get exact values, but intuition is where it all starts. Discovering how the world works, even in a general way, is interesting, and KSP makes it accessible to everyone.

Watching so many people develop their knowledge of how the world works (even if they didn't realise they were doing it) has made me really happy, and I just thought you should know.

Posted here: tips, tricks, definitions, and advice for newcomers!",IrishmanErrant,257,27,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1apkcp/welcome_new_steam_engineers_rocket_jockeys_and/,"Considering how Kerbal Space Program (or KSP) is currently the number 5 top selling game on Steam hours after it launched, I felt it might be nice to set up a catch-all post concerning tips, tricks, hints and definitions for brand new players and experienced ones alike. I'll be updating this thread over the next few hours as extra tips come in!

1. When it comes to rockets, less is more! Lightening the load you're trying to get to orbit makes WAY more of a difference than strapping an extra few boosters onto your bottom stage; keep everything efficient!

2. Getting to orbit is tricky, and it's not at all self-explanatory. Without going into too much depth, you don't get to orbit by shooting straight up as fast as you can. Around 10000 meters up from the surface of Kerbin, you want to being what we call your Gravity Turn; you start pitching slowly down the 90 degree line on your navball, holding it steady around 45 degrees. This helps you transfer upward momentum into sideways momentum, and keeps you from shooting straight up and straight back down. You head towards the 90 degree marker because it's the equatorial one, and is the most efficient way to fly!

3. If your rocket is wobbling, never fear, struts are here! Liberal application of struts are key to avoiding too much structural instability. Something else that can help; if you find your rocket lurching back and forth on launch, right click on each of the outside booster engines and select ""Lock Gimbal"" to avoid too much movement.

4. ASAS unit = The computer that allows you to press T and have the rocket keep it's heading. Only one of these is necessary on any rocket. SAS unit = A large gyroscope that lets you put torque into the rocket, dampening rotation, but not making quicker turns. This is only ever necessary on larger vessels, because all command pods and probe bodies have something similar built in, which allows for turns in space without thrusters.

5. You'll see a ton of strange words get tossed around here; but not to worry! This community is amazing, and they will answer just about any question, no matter how basic. Some of the more common terms you might see: 

delta-V = the change in velocity, the total amount of energy left in the rocket. Think of it as a combination of fuel supply and efficiency; it takes a certain amount of delta-V, measured in m/s, to get to orbit, and another certain amount to get to another object in orbit. 

Asparagus staging = a way of configuring your rocket for maximum efficiency while launching. You connect your booster tanks in such a way as to drop them off symmetrically, while draining fuel from only one pair of tanks at a time. [The bottom diagram is an example of asparagus staging.](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ13WKWNc8scgheecBybE8csqg_kXwvcW58o5XmbM50DFTPhHqQyA) Fuel is drawn from the tanks at the end of the fuel lines first, and these tanks and engines are jettisoned as they empty. This leads to a big jump in efficiency, because you are getting rid of unused weight, and the rest of the rocket is fully fuelled!

SSTO = Single Stage To Orbit. Usually used in reference to spaceplanes capable of taking off and getting to orbit without jettisoning anything along the way. These are crazy-difficult, at least for me.",,False,self,t5_2smr1,1363837045.0,,,True,t3_1apkcp,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1apkcp/welcome_new_steam_engineers_rocket_jockeys_and/,

Not everyone knows a few of the more advanced controls though. [Here is a keyboard layout](http://i.imgur.com/j9VvnWE.jpg) with some of the more important secondary controls highlighted.

Another trick not on the layout for the assembly buildings is ALT+left-click: copies the highlighted part. Can be used to duplicate entire sections/booster assemblies.

When you're doing your gravity turn, do you get tired from switching between the map and the main camera because the map shows your apoapsis and the main camera has the navball? Look at the bottom of the map for [this gray tab](http://i.imgur.com/T2rzPbD.png). Click it and the navball [pops up](http://i.imgur.com/sZMqcCu.png) on the map, so you can do your gravity turn while keeping an eye on your apoapsis. It makes life a lot easier!

When building spaceplanes, use the avionics package and *not* SAS or ASAS, unless the plane is going into orbit. The SAS units try their best to hold a heading and makes flying the plane harder because it will 'undo' part of your last maneuver. The avionics package just tries to keep your plane flying straight, but doesn't interfere with your maneuvers that much.

Also for spaceplanes, use a joystick, not the keyboard. It nearly eliminates the 'rocking' that planes do while you're flying them around and makes flying a lot better. I still prefer keyboard for my rockets though. I alternate between a proper joystick and a Xbox 360 controller.

**Quick and dirty guide to Mun Orbit with pictures**

1. Launch and fly straight up to 10,000m. This gets you out of the thickest part of the atmosphere the fastest and will cost less fuel than if you start your gravity turn at &lt;10,000m.
2. Bring up the map and navball how I showed you eariler. Slowly tilt your rocket east (90 degrees on the navball) and keep an eye on your apoapsis. Once the apoapsisis is above 70,000m you'll want your rocket to be parallel to the ground.
3. Choose your orbit height. I usually go for somewhere between 90-105km. 70km is the minimum.
4. Once you've got your apoapsis to your orbit height, either [set up a manuver node](http://i.imgur.com/i4jWwGC.png) on the apoapsis that circularizes your orbit or just eyeball it by starting your burn on the apoapsis and watching for when the apoapsis/periapsis markers switch. Keep your rocket pointing as close to your prograde as possible. Your orbit should not go below 70,000 or you will re-enter.
5. Set up a manuver node that will take you to Mun. The best way to do this is to [have your apoapsis at ~11,200,000m](http://i.imgur.com/8dXPsmg.png) and then move the node around Kerbin until you get a [Mun intercept](http://i.imgur.com/8Gr9uIZ.png). Adjust the position and power of the node until the Mun periapsis is where you want it. I usually do between 15-60km. 
6. Warp to the Mun. Right after entering its influence is a good time to adjust your orbit if you want, as the lower your altitude gets, the more fuel it will take to do the same maneuver.
7. Once you're happy with your orbit angle and Mun periapsis, set up a [maneuver node on the periapsis](http://i.imgur.com/e4MZQbV.png) to circularize the orbit. Execute the burn.
8. Congrats, you are now in [Mun orbit](http://i.imgur.com/YUTWMt0.png)! Hope you brought a lander...

EDIT: There have been a couple questions about maneuver nodes. To set one up, click your trajectory on the map where you want to start your burn. Then, adjust the maneuver by using the pull-tabs that pop up on the node. To adjust where the node is, click and drag the circle with the pull-tabs on it around your trajectory. Keep your mouse in the circle as you drag it because if it turns red/orange, the node will be deleted.",,False,self,t5_2smr1,1366486104.0,,ksp,True,t3_1cqimr,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1cqimr/tips_tricks_and_a_quick_and_dirty_guide_to_get_to/,

If you see any missing/incorrect information, please let me know.

DISCLAIMER: This is not an official changelog.  Any information previously released by the devs is subject to change.  Not all of the features listed here will be part of the 0.19 update.  No official release date for 0.19 has been announced.

[Re-entry effects](http://i.imgur.com/wRgFZuc.png)

* [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esMZjRtol5c)
* Based on geometry so works for all objects... [including Kerbals](http://i.imgur.com/JMWJZTm.png)
* Dependent on speed/atmospheric pressure
* [Color is dependent on atmospheric composition](http://i.imgur.com/xky1shp.png)
* Added ""wobble"" to plasma trails; might add particle effects
* Added sound effects
* No actual heat in 0.19
 - Might add heat shields at that point
* [Mach effects](http://i.imgur.com/6T6sFvV.png)
 - Sonic boom will be tricky to add (balance between realism and entertainment)

[Kerbal Space Center changes](http://i.imgur.com/NJPIuwg.jpg)

* [Launch tower removed](http://i.imgur.com/O1hWQVJ.png)
* [New, bigger launch pad with ramp](http://i.imgur.com/D013Avc.jpg)

* [Probe cores now have markings that show which direction is forward](http://i.imgur.com/roWkMa2.png)
* [Kerbal EVA seats](http://imgur.com/dvVenvp) (may not be ready for 0.19)
* Mk2 cockpit will be re-modeled later.  IVA view will be created at that point.

New wheel parts

* [Small wheels](http://i.imgur.com/CUBsg5f.png)
 - [Description](http://i.imgur.com/Hyprel2.png)
* [Medium wheels](http://i.imgur.com/ke4fz8R.jpg)
 - [Description](http://i.imgur.com/QPlGxxX.png)
* [""Tank style"" wheels](http://i.imgur.com/p4w5I32.jpg)
 - [Description](http://i.imgur.com/ZmedOq8.png)
 - Can't rotate, but can use brake turning
* Wheels run on electric charge
* [Wheels can break if impact too hard or drive too fast](http://i.imgur.com/M4OOeqz.png)
 - [Wheels can be repaired in EVA](http://i.imgur.com/BCdlrgo.png)
 - [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0TbY6DzS6w)
* [Wheel turning relative to center of mass](http://i.imgur.com/r27twYb.png)
 - [Steering adapts even after over docking](http://i.imgur.com/YxIhj2d.png)
* Steering works in any axis (even if your rover tips over); can lock or invert steering of individual wheels

[New structural parts](http://i.imgur.com/IbHml0N.jpg)

* [Probodyne rovemate part](http://i.imgur.com/bDF9ekm.png)
 - [Description](http://i.imgur.com/Mvn0ep7.png)
* [I-beams](http://i.imgur.com/qlXfQEq.png)
 - [M-Beam 200 I-Beam](http://i.imgur.com/vXMd9UT.png)
 - [M-Beam 200 I-Beam Pocket Edition](http://i.imgur.com/8nXFaND.png)
 - [M-Beam 650 I-Beam](http://i.imgur.com/1YyujRp.png)
* [Structural panels](http://i.imgur.com/omJAWlm.png)
 - [1x1 panels](http://i.imgur.com/bJTqilm.png)
 - [2x2 panels](http://i.imgur.com/rJ5NxVa.png)
 - [Another example of 1x1 panels](http://i.imgur.com/8G7V8HZ.jpg)

* [The Not-Rockomax Micronode](http://i.imgur.com/4XIqV90.png)
* [Unidentified part](http://i.imgur.com/EB4oFbF.png)

New resource harvesting/processing parts

* [Rock drill](http://i.imgur.com/DIPa2I0.png) (used to acquire solids)
* [Pump drill](http://i.imgur.com/kvJsStE.gif) (used to acquire liquids)
* [Resource containers](http://i.imgur.com/nbNAjUn.png)
* [HMU](http://i.imgur.com/MrZKB2w.png) (refines dirt)
* [Blutonium refiner](http://i.imgur.com/38bhWIg.png)

[Resource maps](http://i.imgur.com/jbI3ZtQ.png)

* [Long range directional scanner](http://i.imgur.com/9ivHBht.png) (requires you to manually aim at planet)
* [Short range omnidirectional scanner](http://i.imgur.com/3QEHQdc.jpg)
* Rovers on the ground will be much more useful for resource mapping than probes in orbit
 - Don't want it to work like ISA Mapsat where you just put a probe in orbit and time warp until you have a full map.  Wants the player to really work to get the map.

[Resources flow chart](http://i.imgur.com/lGlWdyn.png) (Note: this version is out of date)

* Other not-yet-revealed resources?
 - Kerbon = carbon analog
* Thought previous version of system had way too many resource processing parts with overly specialized functions, so added parts that can process multiple resources
 - A chemical plant that can process resources into liquid fuel/oxidizer
 - A workshop that can process resources into parts
 - More advanced parts will be heavier, have higher power requirements and may require a crew to operate (that you will need to keep alive when life support is added)
* No distinction between solid/liquid/gas resources (e.g. water harvested from a pump, or condensed from the air, or mined ice at polar caps all goes to the same place)
* Resource system won’t be ready for 0.19

Career mode

* Achievements (e.g. landing a probe on Duna) will unlock bigger ""contracts"" for future missions and branches of the research &amp; development tree

Fixed lighting glitch where light would pass through planets

* [Now your ships will appear properly dark on the night side of planets](http://i.imgur.com/XNcQGE3.png)
* [Better sunrises/sunsets](http://i.imgur.com/ToIlQrl.png)

It was a revelation!  For weeks I've been admiring everyone's space stations and Apollo-style CSM/LM multi-stage ships... I watched several tutorials and tried time after time to successfully dock two of my ships but never had any success until last night.

I don't know what was different but suddenly it just worked.  First I linked up two of my small un-manned satellites.  Next up I had two brave Kerbals in MK1 command pods meet up in low orbit in a historic first...  Flash forward several hours and I've successfully assembled a pretty damn big orbital fueling station with 4 Rockomax jumbo tanks, several habitat modules, a full time crew, tons of docking ports, solar panels, accent lighting, two auxiliary rockets w/ mun landers docked for future missions...the works.  It was a thing of beauty!

Satisfied after spending waaaay too many hours putting this thing together, I decided at nearly 3am that it was finally time to get some sleep.

That's when it happened...

I took one last admiring look at my work, opened the menu, and instead of hitting Return to Space Center...............

I clicked ""End Flight"".

1368811074.0,185,self.KerbalSpaceProgram,1ej0yo,Because all the horrible flag designs are hurting my eyes: Vexillological principles of flag design,ZankerH,247,62,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1ej0yo/because_all_the_horrible_flag_designs_are_hurting/,"* **Keep it simple** - The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory. Flags flap. Flags drape. Flags must be seen from a distance. Under these circumstances, only simple designs make effective flags. Furthermore, complicated flags cost more to make, which often can limit how widely they are used.

* **Use meaningful symbolism** - The flag's images, colours or patterns should relate to what it symbolizes. Symbolism can be in the from of the ""charge"" or main graphic element, in the colours used, or sometimes even in the shapes or layout of the parts of the flag. Usually a single primary symbol is best - avoid those that are less likely to be representative or unique. Colours often identify.

* **Use 2-3 basic colours** - Limit the number of colours on the flag to three, which contrast well and come from the standard colour set. The basic flag colours are red, blue, green, black, yellow and white. They can range from dark to light. Occasionally other colours are also used, such as purple, grey and orange, but they are seldom needed in a good design. Separate dark colours with a light colour, and light colours with a dark colour to help them create effective contrast. A good flag should also reproduce well in ""grey-scale"", that is, in black and white shades.

* **No lettering or seals** - Try to avoid the use writing of any kind or an organization's seal unless it is simple. Words defeat the purpose: Why not just write USA on a flag? A flag is a graphic symbol. Lettering is nearly impossible to read from a distance and hard to sew. Words are not reversible and this forces double or triple thickness fabric. Heavy flags do not fly as well nor do they last as long. Don't confuse a flag with a banner, such as what is carried in front of a marching band in a parade, or draped behind a speaker's platform - such banners don't flap, they are seen from only one side, and they're usually seen closer-up. Seals were designed for placement on paper to be read at close range. Very few are effective on flags - too detailed. Better to use some element from the seal as a symbol. Some logos work; most don't.

* **Be distinctive or be related** - Avoid duplicating other flags, but use similarities to show connections. This is perhaps the most difficult principle, but it is very important. Sometimes the good designs are already ""taken"". However, a flag's symbols, colours, and shapes can recall other flags - a powerful way to show heritage, solidarity, or connectedness. This requires knowledge of other flags.",,False,self,t5_2smr1,False,,gilly,True,t3_1ej0yo,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1ej0yo/because_all_the_horrible_flag_designs_are_hurting/,

1362235197.0,184,self.KerbalSpaceProgram,19iu7c,[Scenario Challenge] A meteor is headed for Kerbin. Can you stop it? Presenting: Kermageddon,SuperSeniorComicGuy,199,15,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/19iu7c/scenario_challenge_a_meteor_is_headed_for_kerbin/,"Several days ago, a large meteor was discovered to be on a direct collision course with Kerbin. Unless stopped, the Kerpophis Meteor will impact Kerbin and devastate the planet. Mission Commander, it is your task to stop the meteor and protect life on Kerbin. Construction resources are unlimited. Time is not. The clock is ticking. Stop that meteor!


Computer simulations have given us the following images: http://imgur.com/a/f2itN

How you choose to stop the impact is up to you:

* Easy: Blast it out of the sky! Success is defined by the destruction of the center x16 fuel tank.

* Medium: Redirect it to crash into the Mun instead!  

* Hard: Capture it and return it safely in one piece to the KSC so our scientists can study it.


Millions of Kerbals are counting on you. Good luck.


Now, let's break the fourth wall and help you load this scenario:

1. Follow this ink and download the ""Kermageddon.sfs"" text file here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/plhlll1fonye54s/Kermageddon.sfs?m

2. Copy the Kermageddon.sfs file into your &lt;KSP&gt;/saves/scenarios folder

3. Start KSP and load the scenario.

4. Optional - Quit or ALT-TAB out of KSP, then copy any pre-existing craft into the newly created &lt;KSP&gt;/saves/scenarios/Kermageddon/Ships/VAB and /SPH folders

5. Stop that meteor!

Most of the normal [Weekly Challenge] rules apply if you want official Bragging Rights™: 

* No Dirty Cheating Alpacas (no debug menu)!

* Stock parts only

* No MechJeb or other plugins allowed

Required screenshots:

* Initial launch craft

* Orbital view of intercept trajectory with Kerpophis Meteor

* Close-up view of both craft coming together or capture

* (Easy) Results of collision

* (Medium &amp; Hard) Orbital view or new trajectory towards Mun or Kerbin

* (Hard) Safe return to KSC

* Whatever else you feel like!

FAQ:

Q: I want to try again. Can I restart?

A: Yes, but **do not hit** that ""Restart"" button because that will **delete everything including your spacecraft** in the scenario folder. Instead, exit or ALT-Tab out of KSP, copy the ""Kermageddon.sfs"" file and paste it into the &lt;KSP&gt;/saves/scenarios/Kermageddon folder. Delete the existing ""persistent.sfs"" and rename the new file you just pasted in there ""persistent.sfs"". This way is much better that hitting ""Restart"" because it is less error prone.

Q: I just accelerated time and the meteor flew right past Kerbin. What gives?

A: The meteor and Kerbin are on rails and literally flew through each other. Save your craft, restart the scenario, and try again.


Q: Can I launch multiple ships?

A: As many as you like. Just remember that the clock is ticking.

Edit: Formatting.

Edit 2: It seems reasonable to be able to practice a bit before trying to save the planet. If you feel like testing your designs, please check out this scenario that has a replica meteor in Kerbin orbit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/cxh3xro6umbl7cm/Kermageddon%20Practice.sfs?m

Edit 3: Changes to ""How to restart"" question. No chance of losing craft now! Also, I created a thread on KSP's official forums so non-Redditors can enjoy (suffer through?)  this challenge:
http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/44451-Scenario-Challenge-A-meteor-is-headed-for-Kerbin-Presenting-Kermageddon

Edit 4: I'm hoping there are a lot of people still working on this challenge. I'm sure that we would all enjoy some progress pics showing the spacecraft or how close you all are getting. I'm sure that others can then help improve the design or burn strategies. Together, we can all save Kerbin!

Edit 5: Hint: Use multiple craft. One probably can't alter its course, send it into orbit, and land/destroy it all in one, so break up the tasks. Divide and conquer.

I see a lot of people in the comments of this subreddit or in various other subreddits where KSP is mentioned talking about how ""I can't even do -this-"" and things of this nature, often with the idea that their ships are really bad.

I guess it first must be noted that yeah, if you're very new at the game, your ships design has a lot of room for improvement, and probably always will so take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt.

I think people need to realize that this game has *way* more to do with how well you're flying the ship versus how good the ship you're flying. What I mean by this is that it is far more important to have a fundamental understanding of the game's mechanics, and the methods best used to achieve the task you're trying to accomplish.

For example, if you're having trouble getting into orbit, it's probably not that you need more fuel tanks, just that you're going about it wrong. Once you get the ideas of gravity turns, throttle control to avoid drag, and maneuvers down, just to name a few, getting into orbit will be easy as pie, whether or not you're flying a junker.

This same principle applies when getting to a moon, or even nearby planets to an extent. There are plenty of tutorial resources out there, I highly highly recommend [Scott Manley's KSP 101] (http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEm5nyZU3a-O2ak6mBYXWPAL) for beginners. 

So just remember, a good ship can only get you so far, but when you have a keen and comprehensive knowledge of the game, you can do just about anything, even building awesome ships!",,False,self,t5_2smr1,False,,,True,t3_1kd2k1,http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1kd2k1/a_psa_for_newbies_on_ship_design_vs_talent/,
