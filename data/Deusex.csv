This is a pretty big milestone for a community which only had around 300 subscribers just a couple weeks before Human Revolution hit.  Nearly all the discussion and submissions are great, and the community has really done a good job chatting with people and each other about the DX games!

To celebrate, I've purchased a gift copy of Deus Ex GOTY on Steam, and I'm going to give it away to one of you guys!  For those who haven't yet played the original DX, now's your chance to own one of the best PC games of all time!  It's a pretty phenomenal game-- better than Human Revolution, in my opinion.

If you would like a piece of the action, just make a DX-themed comment below and we'll randomly choose a winner in a little while.  Thanks for subscribing and contributing to the community!

**The BackStory**
Growing up with the original and being young I learned to see past the dated graphics that many stopped at and experienced the depth of the game's plots, story and philosophy. I became a Big fan.
With growing Maturity growing up and Several replays later I was enjoying each play though as a new experience!
One day I got linked to that tiny teaser for DX3 this sparked my constant hunting for any and all news related to it. the following years of development for the game exposed me to its amazing art decor and design which ultimately must of caused this desire to live and breath in a space that directly inspires me of such a world.
So to the part that's most interesting. the finished product.
I'm currently sat in the room now typing this away being able to appreciate its company meaning i could post pictures now!
However Being quite the showman! ( And dead proud how well it looks!) I'm going to wait for one more component to arrive (Keyboard)to be 100% finished then I'll Create the DSLR album! (both night and day, the difference between the two is staggering!)
Hope you Guys Enjoy the Room as much as I had watching it being built!

**TLDR: Room Album will be up tomorrow! I'm won over by it! hopefully you are too!**

1. Exit Steam
2. Go to www.flyvpn.com, download a trial.
3. Connect to a US node
4. Start steam
5. Run Deus Ex; let it decrypt etc. Then exit the game.
6. Put steam in offline mode and let it restart.
7. Exit FlyVPN
8. Play as much as you want.

Do not let steam go back into online mode until it's released in your location. I don't know if it will relock etc. Also please don't spam this out to everyone; I only want to help excited redditors and not bypass game releases..

Edit: I see someone posted a method similar to this in /r/gaming now; with some other vpn solution. Looks like people know about/have been doing this.. I did see someone say be careful you could get banned. My advice is to do exactly like I said - go to offline mode and do not go back on until release!

Or at least he's referenced in that manner throughout the game.

Virgin birth? His body helped the entire human race. He was resurrected technically since he did get hit with a magnum bullet to the skull at contact range.

If you choose the ending where the facility is destroyed at the end of Deus Ex Human Evolution, essentially he did kill himself to protect all augmented people in the world. He died for their sins.

I enjoy stories when they reference the Bible. Some of Phillip K Dick's best work, like ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" is heavily based off of the Bible. For writers, it's not too much of a 'religious text' as it's full of stories that people seem to really like.

At one point in the game, I was expecting someone to say 'they' created Adam Jensen from Jesus's DNA, explaining why he adapted so well to augmentations, and how he's ""The one."" 

Of course he's not Jesus, but it's kind of fun to make that parallel, helping you find other mysteries about the origins of Adam Jensen, and how he was the key to this Human Revolution. 

What do you guys think?

1365479585.0,46,self.Deusex,1byvet,why I chose the Sarif Ending (major spoilers),ChromeGhost,51,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/1byvet/why_i_chose_the_sarif_ending_major_spoilers/,"So at the end of the game I was presented with the option of Telling people the truth as Darrow suggested,  Siding with the Iluminati, as Taggart Suggested, or Sticking with Sarif.  The fourth option was to kill everyone.

Now all these options have their flaws but I will explain my reasoning.  I would have been tempted to choose to destroy panchea but I didnt want to kill the innocent people I spent the whole level trying to save and protect(and that poor LIMB clinic girl!).  It would also leave people grieving for their lost love ones and leave them without answers.  I felt the was a cop out so I didn/t go with it

So that leaves Hugh, Taggart and Sarif.   First lets talk about how they present themselves as people.  Out of all three, I thought Sarif was the most likeable guy there.  Not without his flaws of course, but despite his flaws he was the only one who was honest about fighting for what he believed in.  Taggart and Hugh played games and switched their stories too often.  I felt their outlook was too negative for my taste, while Sarif was the only one who tried to be consistently optimistic.   Not only that, but I felt they were a bit callous about the innocent people they were affecting. For example, taggart calls the innocent victims in panchea ""augmented monsters"". while Sarif's first concern was about the wounded.  It is also revealed that Hugh was bitter about being one of the rare few who's genetics would reject augmentation.  I felt this made his ""truth"" too biased, and would set technology and progress backwards.  And while someone may bring up that Sarif was funded by the DOD, I feel that this was a necessity in order for the greater good to be achieved.  If it wasn't Sarif it would be some other company.  Finally, he wasnt in it for the money.  If you look at Athenes computer, you would see that he has turned down DeBeers many times for ethical reasons.  I got the sense that he really wanted what was best for the world

Now lets talk about society in the grand scheme.  Its in our nature to evolve.  People get so hung up about their fears of people turning themselves into weapons that they fail to see one of the biggest benefits to augmentations.  Neural augs.  Imagine the progress that would be made possible if everyone could be neural augmented.  It would really help doctors, scientists economists..  we could make strides in human progress.  The technology would enable us to work together more efficiently, and come up with creative solutions to the problems we face.  Also with Adams DNA, one of the biggest barriers to augmentation would be removed; neuropozine.  Having to pay for anti rejection drugs would keep augmentation out of reach for the poor.  Even if they could save money and get augmented, they would have struggle to pay for a lifetime of drugs.  But Megan's research would change that.

So that was the rationale behind my decision.",,False,,t5_2r0qr,1365491511.0,,,True,t3_1byvet,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/1byvet/why_i_chose_the_sarif_ending_major_spoilers/,

Anyway, Jean-François Dugas and James Swallow ended up posting in [The Fall Q&amp;A thread](http://forums.eidosgames.com/showthread.php?t=138034&amp;page=2) - there were some mentions of Eidos Montreal makes changes in communication, whatever that means. Was it that bad before? I wasn't around when HR was released. In any case, nice of them to answer some questions. 

Here's what JFD said about the dialogues ([source](http://forums.eidosgames.com/showpost.php?p=1929326&amp;postcount=42)):

Just to set the record straight - When we say it took us 6 months, it's an average but still quite accurate. It's not only about animations nor about the fact that branching dialog is a simple system in essence.

There were many things to take into consideration. We need to figure out a lot of aspects:

1. Who is this character and what is the conflict with him? (why Jensen cares and vice versa). It was easier with characters such as Haas because we were able to build a background story about him and Jensen. However, when you get to characters such as Zeke or Tong, it becomes trickier because those guys have no common history. So, there are a lot of brainstorms about finding the ""thing"" that will make the social fight work.

2. Once it's figured out, you need to understand the inner logic of the system (which I won't explain here). In essence, you make a dialog choice, the NPC reacts than counter attack. His counter attack is picked from a pool randomly for each round of the social battle. Thus, it makes each encounter playable more than once. What all that means? We had to write about 20 mins of dialog for each social battles even though they last less than 5 mins when you play them. Making all the possible connections blend naturally in each other was quite a challenge.

3. We build the system in Excel (playable version) and send it to most of the Eidos Montreal studio. People play it and send us back their Excel sheet with their track record and their additional feedback. It allows us to see what works and what doesn't. We can go through several iterations (or not) depending on the feedback we receive.

4. Once we're pretty comfortable with the results, it's all about staging the battle. Where is this happening? How can we make it dynamic and not just 2 guys talking? You have to remember that at this point in time, levels are still being built and the rooms where those encounters happen aren't being fully built before we figure out the pace, the movement, etc. So, now it's time to brainstorm on this and figure out the drama. Then we draw a top-down view of the basic layout of the room and we add the choreography on top of it. We do it in 3D - we take the measurements, etc.

5. Now, animators have all the information to go in mo-cap. A part of the team is going to take care of the body while the other part will work on the facial.

6. then we have to put it in the engine, make it work, see what can be improved, added, etc.

The bottom line is that it goes much beyond pure animation production, there's a design phase that is mostly about finding creative solutions than execution. The latter being only a part of the recipe.",,False,,t5_2r0qr,False,,,True,t3_1gwoyp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/1gwoyp/jeanfrançois_dugas_explains_how_dialogue_battles/,

So Deus Ex 1...,CSec064,52,8,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/uhnap/hey_guys_so_deus_ex_1/,"Greetings gentlemen, I've been on a nostalgia train for the past few weeks about Deus Ex 1. During my breaks at work I've been playing DX, at home I've been working on a multiplayer map for some reason and been trying to connect with old clan members. Here's a little bit (I lied, a lot) of my story:

In the glorious yearr of Deus Ex's release I was in middle school. I started playing DXSP and due to hardware problems I always GPFed when trying to transfer to Tonnochi_Road from the Canals. I tried going through that little 128x128 hallway so many times in a desperate hope that I may make it through *once*. My god, I still know the Canal's layout like the back of my hand because I would just play it over... and over... and over; even that was enough to keep my Deus Ex fix going. But there was always that one obstacle in the back of my mind... haunting me... taunting me... I was never able to cross that threshold to greatness until I finally got a graphics card for Christmas.

**best Christmas ever.**

Fastforward a bit and I started playing DXMP. I ran into this guy named... *sigh* Playerbigdick and for some reason started joining servers with the guy regularly and we would always be on the same team (usually NSF).* I ran through the hood by the name of ""FBI"" around this time and yes... that was ""Female Body Inspector."" But anyway, we decided to create a clan called... [NSF]. Can you guess the meaning of our version of NSF? If you are as big of a cheese ball as I was back then you guessed correctly: ""Never Stop Fraggin'."" I remember it like it was yesterday, we were exploring the map DXMP_Oilrig and we just decided to start this unholy pact for whatever reason. This guy, who is uh... ""Edwin"" from here on out introduced me to the Unreal Editor and I took to it like crazy.

 Here, ZeroPresence was born and I went on to create probably hundreds of multiplayer maps. Be them functioning releases like DXMP_Deepblue or just cool maps that the other [NSF] members and myself would create and host on the server to fart around in. Great group of guys and we just had fun in the server most of the time checking out our creations. Around this time that Edwin fellow just sort of lost contact with all of us and started doing his own thing whatever that may be. Also, something I wanna get off my chest: some of you folks may remember some junky maps created by a player that went by the name of Jazz...

I want to formally appologize for him and his maps such as... ""Jazz's_Torture_Castle_v1"" v2, v3, and whatever other horrors he unleashed upon the world. Especially if you were one of the poor souls with a glimmer in your eye for cool custom maps and ended up being murdered by an elevator mover that lowered you into a waterzone with no escape. Cool kid, but come on...

Anyway, I met my best friend of 8 years now through [NSF] and we chat about DX from time to time and sometimes jump into a non-dedicated server and just run through our old maps. For some reason this is always fun and we have some good laughs remembering those days and the people we met along the way.

Sometime during all this I started working on TNM. Some of my worst and best mapping was done in this mod and I'm happy I was a part of it. Just another chapter in my fond memories of this game and how it had an effect on me. Trestkon, you are a great guy and I'm sure all those cakes you baked were as delicious as they looked. Jonas, you are still and always will be a butthead.

I'm always gonna wonder what happened to Edwin and the other guys from [NSF]. I know that Edwin went by another name ""Gheist"" on DeusExEditing and created that Tactical mod that I still see on servers from time to time to this day. If any of you goof balls are here give me a shout. Also, I would love to discuss some of my fellow Redditor's own examples of nostalgia for this game!

*: You have no idea how many times I rewrote this sentence.

Later, when you head to the police station to collect the hacker's neural implant, you can stop by the holding cells and Zeke will be there. You can talk with him, at which point he boasts that he has friends in high places and he won't be in jail for long, and warns you not to go after his brother.

I thought that was neat.

I finished up Panchea last night and the video just finished uploading.

**Here's the Youtube playlist:**  
http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL505C27A6024C6C75

The series is presented as a mission-by-mission walkthrough. I skip the traveling between missions, and cut out conversations and cutscenes. There's no commentary.

Even though it's not strictly a pacifist playthrough (I do kill a few guards here and there, and I go to town on the Belltower soldiers at the construction site where Malik crashes) most of the missions are done without engaging a single enemy.

I decided to put myself through this for a number of reasons.

First and foremost, I like challenging myself by adding extra rules into the games I play. In most cases it helps me become more familiar with the mechanics of the game, and it's always exhilarating when I manage to succeed. The Deus Ex franchise seems especially welcoming to this playstyle, partially because of the high level of freedom the player is given in achieving objectives.

The other reason is that there are things people seem to take for granted about this game; like that the boss fights are almost impossible without the Typhoon, or that certain areas are impossible to sneak through without the cloak. We've seen the threads where someone is ready to give up on the game because of a seemingly inescapable situation due to the wrong choice of augmentation. I wanted to demonstrate that it's possible to play through the entire main story without any particular set of augs.

I hope you enjoy it! It was a lot of fun to make. Any questions are welcome.",,False,,t5_2r0qr,False,,,True,t3_zpx05,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/zpx05/my_noaugmentation_ghost_playthrough_is_finally/,

I'll update as well if i find any more. 

Praxis Kit #1

Location. Look for it on a box after exiting an elevator in the Sarif Industries Milwaukee Labs.



Praxis Kit #2

Location. There is one Praxis Kit hidden in the Detroit Downtown The Praxis kit is inside an illegal augmentation ‘Chopshop’, (its on the same building as the first side quest with tim) which is on the second floor. The code to get inside is 2356 (you can also find the media sec for the code  if you jump over a tall wall near by the police station) – Once you are inside, hack the level 2 terminal, then hack the level 1 computer for the final code and you will end up in the area with Praxis Kit.



Praxis Kit #3

Detroit City Sewers: Below or near the Chiron Building, around the norther sections of the Detroit Hub, enter the sewers and look at the map. In the eastern corner, in a dead-end south of a sewer entrance, you’ll find a light wall. Upgrade your augmented strength to punch through light walls.



Praxis Kit #4

Derelict Row Apartment: Inside Derelict Row, enter the apartment building and move up to the third floor to find a Praxis Kit near a dead body. You’ll find this one naturally while completing a main quest during your second visit to the Detroit Hub.



Praxis Kit #5

Hengsha Sewers: Underneath the city, look for a ‘U’ section of sewers below the Huang Hua Hotel. You’ll need to be able to break through a light wall in the sewer to find the Praxit Kit with some pain killer.



Praxis Kit #6

Hengsha Court Gardens: Sneak into the elevator shaft, instead of climbing up, climb down to the bottom of the shaft and look underneath the elevator to find another Praxis Kit on the floor.



Praxis Kit #7

Tai Yong Medical: On the second floor of the actual Tai Yong building, after entering the lab, move up to the second floor. Before continuing up to the third floor, turn left and take a hallway, through a door, into another corridor where there are two officers. Enter the first office, or enter the second office and return to the first through the connecting door, to find a Praxis Kit in the south-western corner.



Praxis Kit #8

Picus: As you enter the news building, reaching the main office floor, you’ll see the place is empty. Run down to the cubicles, down the center row and check the center-left desks for an easy Praxis Kit.

I gave Deus Ex multiple shots. I loaded up the character, landed on Liberty Island and was on my way, full of motivation and ready to learn about how great this game is. 

I come across my first enemy: try to shoot him with a pistol...miss. I keep firing waiting for him to drop. A bullet to the head finally lands and he's dead. My leg completely immobile from the enemy fire.

But wait a second, through greatest game ever prospective, this is the pinnacle of gaming! But I had this nagging feeling. Which was...

The enemy acted completely retarded. First, he tries to crouch and shoot me, runs in a circle, stops. After his line dance he resumes firing at me.

What the hell, I thought this game was strategic. I see idiot NPC's running around and graphics out of a hl1 mod with half the intelligence of a combine soldier.

I press on to encounter more of these NPC's, all acting like crack babies. I use my hack tools on some things, unlock some vents...

After about an hour of playing, each time, I would call it quits.

'It's Outdated,"" ""The Combat is weak and combat is uninspired,"" and ""I'd rather be playing (insert recent release here)"" were my thoughts.

So, I kept quitting. The furthest I got was about 2 hours in... to the Hell's Kitchen, New York part. I didn't get it. 

But I was severely short sighted. This game is one of a kind. It took me 2 years of ignoring, returning, and repeating to realize it. 

My latest play through I loaded up my character. I picked skills that I knew would come in handy from the times before that I played and was on my way.

The moment I knew it was an experience to cherish is when I broke into the Statue of Liberty building and, after ducking and avoiding multiple enemies I found a ventilation shaft to sneakily crawl through and rescue Gunther Hermann without alerting anyone to my presence. 

The choice, the freedom, was finally shown to me. 

I've been hooked ever since. This is my 4th play through and I'm gearing up for the fifth afterwords.

I wrote this because I feel there are a lot of players who want to appreciate the consensus, the consensus that Deus Ex is the holy grail of gaming...but also enjoy it regardless of age. 

So to those gamers who want to appreciate what eventually will be considered one of the greatest pieces of gaming all I can say is: keep trying to play it, its worth the effort.

It's a game about consumerism and capitalism in general, and how it eventually destroys humanity, Adam Jensen... and you.

Think about it, what were the most valuable praxis points you ever spent? Vertical leap? Wall-punch? Cool-guy landing system? Generic hacking upgrade #7? Cloaking is nice, but it's throttled by the extremely limited energy system like any other energy-requiring augmentation. It'd be nice to use a luxury like cloaking, but due to limited resources it's hard to find a good opportunity.

If you're like me, it's a no-brainer: the upgrades to your limited energy regeneration system, and your upgrades to inventory. Both upgrades make resources in the game less limited. It's pretty much the only unequivocally good thing I got out of the praxis system.

And why are resources in the game so limited? Two words- candy bars. Fuck Neuropozyne, who's making a mint on these bars? There's only a few dozen of them in the whole world, Adam eats them all the time but we never see him do it like he's embarrassed of his life-crippling candy bar habit. Is everyone augmented as dependent on these candy bars as Adam? What happens when the candy's all gone? Keep in mind that we're talking about *energy* here. Literally the most plentiful thing in the universe is throttled in-game by limited resources.

Despite the game's limited resources, there's a concession. Your last energy bar always recharges, even if you use all of it. Because hey, we all make mistakes. It's not like the game wants you to *starve*. Sometimes you just don't have a candy bar on-hand and you need a little hand-out, or a bail-out if you will, to keep yourself afloat. But as a result *you never eat any of the super-rare candy bars and you subsist the entire game on ~~government~~ energy handouts.* But the ~~welfare check~~ extra energy bar doesn't always come exactly when you need it and you have to ~~kill your kids~~ wait next to the guard for a few seconds before you can melee him.

Near the end of the game, Adam is sent to an ocean facility or some shit. ""Finally,"" he thinks, ""an opportunity to use all these resources I've accumulated."" Unfortunately, what awaits him is nothing more than a bunch of pseudo-zombies and a lackluster boss fight- both of which present very few opportunities to actually utilize his massive accumulation of resources. The end, for Adam, is the same as the end for all of us- no matter how cool your robot arms, how retractable your sunglasses, or how 1337 your h4x, your last energy bar never recharges when you're dead.

This fix wil disable mouse acceleration, but involves changing two values in your registry, so DO NOT do it if you're not comfortable editing it! Saying that, it's relatively straightforward, and we will only be modifying two values.

Also, be advised that this will BREAK game controller support, so only do this if you're using a keyboard and mouse (which I imagine a lot, if not most, of you are.)

1. On Vista/7, bring up the start menu search box, or press windows key + r to bring up the run console. On XP, just bring up the run command from the start menu

2. Type ""regedit"" without the quotes to bring up the registry editor.

3. Navigate to ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Eidos\Deus Ex: HR""

4. Look for an entry called: 
     g_debugFreeLookSpeedScalingRatio_Pitch

5. This entry will have some value, different for some people. mine was:
    64 00 00 00. Whatever this is, change this value to 00 00 00 00.

6. Find another entry called: 
    g_debugFreeLookSpeedScalingRatio_Yaw and do the same again for that.

When I started again I decided to roleplay the character, which has been much more enjoyable. So far I've been doing this:

* No quicksaving, reloading or letting myself die on purpose: I'll do everything in my power to survive every time.

* No being a pack mule: I carried a revolver, a silenced tenmil and a stun gun, no other weapons. Can't sneak through vents with a rocket launcher on your back right?

* Prioritize: I tried to prioritize my objectives from the perspective of my character: only do sidequests if it was appropriate, don't waste time doing things that aren't mission critical, 

* Act in character: don't meta-game, don't jump around running around the sidewalks, try and behave like a human being.

The result has been a game with a lot more immersion, tension and excitement. It's also been much more difficult, as the game heavily rewards metagame thinking and random exploration, so I haven't been picking up a lot of exp and bonuses.

This is something that has been bothering me for a while. Throughout the game, you are expected to see the opposing viewpoints - control of augmentation, abolition of augmentation, and unopposed augmentation.

Each choice was supposed to have a 'bad' aspect to it - but I never saw an issue with allowing Sarif to have full and free control over augs. He genuinely seemed to be a force for good, though he definitely did a few questionable things (engineering Megan/Adam's relationship, running background checks on him, getting Adam augmented without consent, and likely a few other things too).

I felt though, compared to the other outcomes, in which Hugh Darrow or Taggart achieved their objectives, Sarif was a much, much morally worthy character, and so to pursue his objectives is not as difficult as the others to justify. 

On the one hand, Sarif/SI has done some questionable things but they mainly relate to Adam (getting augmented, etc) - and the player definitely has a lot of control in determining how moral SI can appear (i.e offering to inquire about distributing Neuropozyne to the poor, etc) but the others - such as Taggart, were actively involved in things involving the Tyrants, with full knowledge of the consequences. 

I find that Sarif could have easily been given a darker, more sinister side - (I always thought if Jensen took the 'upgraded' biochip, rather than having Megan 'deactivate' it - a built in kill switch, activated by Pritchard would be much better, in terms of questionable morality).

I am wondering what you guys think. I've thought about this for a while, and haven't really played the game recently, but I just can't lead myself to conclude anything other than Sarif, while a bit too Utilitarian, hasn't really committed anything anywhere near the level of Darrow or Taggart, and therefore 'his' ending, in which biotech corporations are free to do whatever they want (Which face it, will basically be SI, as the driving force behind Tai-Yong is dead).",,False,,t5_2r0qr,False,,,True,t3_1aipey,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/1aipey/why_i_believe_the_best_ending_is_the_sarif_ending/,

An interesting reply about The Fall from moderator Jerion:

&gt;Deus Ex: The Fall is a tangent game. It is not the future of the core of the series. It is designed to bring the core of Human Revolution's gameplay and an expansion of the universe lore to the iPad while providing an additional avenue to expose new fans to the series- and it does this with surprisingly strong execution. What it is not is a sequel to Human Revolution; That game has yet to make an appearance. No, this is something altogether different, and should be evaluated accordingly. As for the lack of jump button, it doesn't impact things in a substantial way. Between the controls being simplified a bit for the touch interface and the level design taking this into account, it is a considered removal. There is a vaulting button which allows for jump-like behavior where contextually reasonable.",,False,,t5_2r0qr,False,,,True,t3_1gerjx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/1gerjx/eidos_forum_moderators_answer_questions_about_the/,

The long, long awaited mod for Half-Life came out today.  It's very impressive - an 8 year long project dedicated to revamping the 1998 game.  

You may be wondering why I bring this up in the DE forums...  

I think they put a LOT of the spirit of Deus Ex into Black Mesa.  It's wonderful!  They added so much more depth, made the story even darker, added more choices and dynamic gameplay - all while staying true to the original Half-Life game.   Even the new lighting seems to be paying homage to DE:HR color scheme a bit (lots of gold and blue).  

Here's an example of what reminds me of DE about Black Mesa:

Early in the Black Mesa mod, you have the opportunity to have someone 'join' you as a teammate, which ~~never existed in the original game~~ (*edit* as GraveTracer pointed out, I was wrong, you could have followers in the original game).  At this point, you do not have a weapon yet (in the original game, you'd just run for your life or whack the shit out of them with your crowbar).  I thought, ""wow, that's pretty cool... let's do this!""  

My new BFF proceeded to back me up like a madman, killing everything in sight.. he was great!  I was starting to think that he might be invincible when suddenly he got caught by one of the creatures from behind.  I watched helplessly (still no weapon at this point) as my new friend had the life strangled out of him and had his corpse tossed carelessly aside.  Then the creature leveled its face-tentacle-thing at me.  I realized at this point that the person underneath is Ted from the bio-mechanical division.  I also realized I should probably start to run, right as the massive red claws raked my face into ribbons.  

**Repawn** So I'm trying to protect my bodyguard a little better this time.  We're doing great, he's shooting them down, we're past the strangle-office previously coated with my face entrails... We're looking good, feeling strong.  The hallway in front of us looks clear.  Right as that happy thought crosses my mind, a flaming headcrabbie comes up behind my buddy, flattening him instantly.  I cannot believe the horror I have just witnessed - again.  In frustration, knowing I am going to die, I rush at them.  The demon (pretty sure that was Shirley from cybernetics) and my buddy were only 10 steps away, but both were ashes by the time I reached them.  I'm about to yell at the sky, ""Nooooooo!"" when I see a gun amidst my buddy's fresh ashes.  A GUN?!?  What the hell?!?  I haven't even found a crowbar yet!  Hearing the groan behind me, I spin around and empty the clip in a panic.  Two headcrabbies drop.  I reload and drop three more.  Woot.  I reach for another clip... Oh shit...   Nothing.  That was a lot fewer bullets than I thought would be in there.  I should run...  I'm in a side-office, with no other exit...  I sigh, then run at the horde, flailing my arms.  

**Respawn** Now I know I can get a gun, if I let my friend die... But I only get a few bullets...  Let's protect him.  Let's do this!  And we did... my new friend was not only a badass, again, but  became a tour guide all of the along the way, bringing all sorts of fun commentary.    

All of that took place in what was originally one long winding hallway.  

It's entirely possible that many players will miss that first ""teammate"" completely.  That same teammate might get killed really quickly, he may get killed a bit later, he might live to be a tour guide for a bit...  Each variation changes the game in subtle ways.  I thought it was so well done that it's easy to mistake your teammate's death and other events as scripted.  

It's not that they turned Half-Life into DE, or anything like that.  I just think Black Mesa changed Half-Life in ways the the DE community would appreciate.  

Sorry to go on like that, but I think my fellow UNATCO agents would really enjoy the Black Mesa mod.  Let me know what you think!

**tl;dr - The changes to the game in the new HL mod Black Mesa kinda remind of Deus Ex.**",,False,,t5_2r0qr,1347813555.0,,,True,t3_zwnkh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/zwnkh/black_mesa/,moderator

First: They come up as a block of black text. This is OK on most reddits, because the background is the light bluish colour of the general Reddit colour scheme, or another such colour. Anyway, on an almost black background, a black censored block blends in too much with the background. May I suggest a gold colour that will be obvious as a spoiler block but also blend in with the general Deus Ex colour scheme.

Second: The instructions on the right are horrible. I think in fact they were written out, but parsed. So just after it says ""We now have spoiler tags!"" it has an actual spoiler tag, rather than instructions for how to make one, because the instruction itself was parsed.

I can say when I played it I was pretty surprised that so late in the game that stealth was suddenly a viable strategy in the boss fight. I'd played most of the game attempted non-lethality and stealth (though not strictly, I did occasionally kill and get in shootouts). I had also not used augs that much. I'd mostly just bought hacking upgrades and level one stealth to get through laser alarm fields. So when I came to the last area I had a bunch of unspent upgrades. I also had an inventory full of unused energy bars as I'd been hoarding them but never actually used a single one. I fully upgraded stealth an batteries. This gave me just enough time to hack each terminal while invisible. It was actually pretty exciting because if I took too long with the hacking my stealth would run out and I'd get shot up and it was the only hacking boss in the entire game!

Officer Murphy muttered to himself, as he patrolled the hallway of an apartment building in Hengsha. ""Have to drag my ass down to the lower city... and nothing's gonna happen. Nothing ever happens. This place is such a waste of my talent. Such a waste."" Murphy had hit the end of the hallway: he turned around, and began to walk the other way. Fifteen years of military and police experience had been seemingly wasted since he had signed up with Belltower. 

""Two wars, six years on the streets of New York... I used to be SWAT,"" Murphy said, ""At least the pay is better. Still a waste. I've been trained to read into people, to notice every little detail, and yet they have me dicking around in some hallway."" Murphy continued down the hallway, saying nothing of the vent cover which was now open rather than closed. ""Its bullshit,"" he said.

Murphy reached the other end of the hallway. He turned around and began to walk again, continuing on his patrol. His partner on the other end of the hall had suddenly disappeared. ""Maybe if I actually get some action - an opportunity to catch this Aug they're bitching about, I can finally be used to my full capabilities. I've been slouching around this hallway all night. Alright, time to focus!"" 

With that said, Murphy steeled himself for the night. His eyes were like that of a hawk, and his ears like that of a dog - nothing would get past him in the hallway. 

""What was that?"" Murphy said to himself, having heard a noise which alarmed him. He turned around and walked down the hallway, scanning each nook and cranny except for those behind small cardboard crates. Arriving near the source of the noise, he looked around, puzzled, as there were no signs of anyone. 

""Must have been nothing,"" Murphy thought to himself, as he walked away from the vending machine which was now suddenly on the other side of the hallway and upside down, ""I should get back to my regular patrol."" So he continued his patrol. ""They really oughta give me a raise,"" Murphy thought to himself as a dart whizzed by his ear, striking the wall on the far end of the hallway, ""I'm doing a really good job here, I think I even deserve a promo-"". Murphy was cut off mid-thought, as Adam Jensen had grabbed him, stabbed him, and snapped his neck.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
From IOS:

**Good**

-Opening cutscene was fantastic, and did a great way of introducing the atmosphere/setting

-Excellent musical score

-Extensive character customization 

-Levels clearly have hidden/multiple paths and secrets similar to the original game

-The Detroit hub is huge, has plenty of sidequests and has a great atmosphere

-The social ""boss fight"" was excellent, and the conversations in general are 
well written

-Played through without cover and had no problems. 

-Hacking is very enjoyable

**Bad**

-The opening sequence sucked. You're walking on rails half the time, then you grab an infinite ammo assault rifle and blast your way through linear corridors (no option for stealth). Thank god it was back to classic Deus Ex after that
-Sariff Industries is kind of dull, especially compared to UNATCO. 

Pritchard/Sariff/Malik are the only people you really get to know and they aren't as interesting (so far) as the UNATCO crew. Its also kind of...bland looking for the most part

-Head bobbing. Needs to go.

-Graphics are underwhelming but everyone already knows that

-Pre-rendered cutscenes kind of take you out of the immersion

-An overall disconnect from the world. You walk into an office filled with items, and you might be able to interact with the computer and an e-book. I know with so much detail they can't really help it but it really took me out of the ""Deus Ex"" experience.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Uberjann

I might get banned for this. 8) Couldn't resist fetching the leak, and... this is the most immersive game I've ever played. I am absolutely blown away... The graphics aren't good in the sense Crysis' graphics are, but they draw you in like no other game I've ever seen. I will say the animations are kind of jarring at first, but you get used to them. Everything is just soaked in atmosphere and detail. Shooting and movement feel excellent. And the music, . Cut-scenes are pre-rendered, but the transitions between them and gameplay are very smooth.

Yeah, I guess if you were to take close-up screenshots of some NPC's ('specially generic ones) or objects it might look bad. It doesn't really affect the experience. 

There's some cool graphical effects going on. Floors and walls glimmer when you're standing still. The smoke and lighting effects somehow seem unique. I mean, I hate most of the ""advances"" in recent years with bloom, motion blur etc, but this is really working for me. It's not realistic, but it's as if it has a unique style (which I also normally hate). It's kind of two-sided, though. It seems almost like they've been using older technology, but have put more work into things. It looks different from everything else. But like I said, I think the visuals as a whole are very impressive. Also, ragdolls here seem really good just from the fact I haven't actually noticed them.

On the gameplay-side of things, I'd have to say the game is (thus far) very easy for someone who has played FPS'es competitively. If you aim at their heads, you can just one-shoot 4 guys in a flash. Like I said, it's very smooth and responsive. 8) You won't get killed if you're fast. I like the way enemies react and move, though. That said, gunplay feels fun and rewarding.

The coolest thing for me is all the detail. Every room is different. There's tons of books, post-it notes, worksheets etc everywhere. It's extremly immersive. I spent ages walking through every room, just looking at stuff, soaking in the atmosphere.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
From Gvaz

I noticed that you can't get the config menu to come up again unless you force one of your two monitors off and if you mess it up the first time, it will keep defaulting to that monitor no matter what. Ugh.

Also can't mousewheel through the keyboard hotkey menu.

Also can't mousewheel the stuff like volume or mouse sensitivity up or down.

Everything else seems pretty standard for the UI though.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
From Numinous (this one is pretty crude)

Some comments on things that it seems mostly nobody else has made or noticed

- Mouse lag is gross, there's also mouse acceleration
- Y axis movement is slowed down as the game doesn't want you looking up or down
- Strafing is twice as fast as sprinting - why did this make it past playtesting...
- Whoever was in charge of setting the default controls should be placed back in Barbie Adventures. CTRL for walk? Right click for cover? 
- Combat is... ridiculously easy - our fears have been realized. Cover makes the entire gameplay experience a joke. Headshots insta kill and there's nothing stopping you lining up a shot and pressing shoot. On ""Deus Ex"" mode.
- Story and characters are reaaaally thin and obvious. I could probably correctly guess the entire story and all of the twists by the first hour.
- The aug menu and such are gross gross gross gross gross
- Heard a hint of Deus Ex music near the start, though the music so far is really unmemorable which was another fear
- I feel like after 1 hour of play I've solved the whole game. With all the overpowered augs I can't imagine there being much fun to be had in the combat/stealth in the rest
- When you holster your weapon then press sprint it cancels the holster
- People that are telling you ""it's totally playable without cover it's great"" are wrong. Period. The only reason it ""works"" is due to the AI being slow to react and telegraphing their animations constantly so you just crouch slide walk out of cover and pop heads everywhere. When you actually play like this though it just feels wrong.
- Pet peeve - why the hell, when you do a take-down on someone who is walking, talking or doing something does the ""takedown cutscene"" fade out and then in and suddenly the victim is STANDING TALL AND UPRIGHT? I think it's really lazy. I know you need a starting frame for animation but this is why cutscene takedowns like this should be avoided unless you can figure out a way to do it smoothly and in-game. MGS did it properly.
- Why cutscenes why

- Jumping is cool - hold for higher jump, press for small one
- Enemies feel really solid and the death animations and physics are heavy. They also drop their guns which you have to loot separately which I like
- Main hub city is pretty cool and npc's say lots of varied things (though nothing of any importance)
- The details and style are really nice. However, there's next to no interactivity and everything feels really linear. 
- I like how you have to actually look at things to interact with them - as opposed to ""stand in the general vicinity and press X"" - though this coolness was quite lessened when I realized the reason it was like this was probably because of the highlighting, which I had off

I sort of feel that this preview leak was a bit of karma - making up for the lack of information over the past couple years. I hope Eidos aren't fretting about it too much, though. I had zero, rock bottom hope for DXHR but after a short go of the preview I feel they've earned my pre-order... NEARLY. I've taken it away as a positive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit : user Numinous had a change of heart.

Heavy gameplay spoilers that have led to my pre-order;

I zoomed in with a tranq rifle and said... this is Deus Ex

Heard someone whistling the DX1 menu theme.

Knocked a cop out in the police station with noone around. Someone heard it, brought backup. I'm standing over the knocked out body expecting to be shot on sight. The cops wake the guy up, look at me, and go back to their business. Awesome.

Nobody else needs to say anything. If the preview has convinced me, it will convince everyone. Mod, be a dear and close the thread.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit : User IOS 

Alright, this game is finally clicking after doing a few side missions and the morgue quest. The Detroit hub really is huge (Makes Hell's Kitchen look puny in comparison) and its very dense. I spent about an hour just in one apartment building breaking into people's apartments and reading their email/stealing from their not so hidden safes. 

The police station mission was great. I chose to do the social boss fight to get in (although I stumbled upon at least two other entrances besides the front door, there could be more) since I'm a social/hacking mix. I've barely got into any combat, but when I do I use the pistol. Love the pistol.

In a way this reminds me a bit more of** Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines** for a few reasons. Obviously there's the third person/regenerating health/takedown/limited interactivity comparisons. But also the way the sidequests are handled. They're so long and indepth that they completely distract you from the main mission. Plus the way conversations are handled, the subtly of the hidden paths I don't know why but I'm really getting a Bloodlines vibe.

I just upgraded Hacking to Lvl 3 so I'm going to go hack into the restricted area of the police station and hack some offices in Sariff Industries to read some email. More to come.

BTW, there are about a billion references to the first game and I've only been playing for about 5-6 hours.

It's ridiculously fun. Honestly I thought just punching everybody would get boring eventually, but it's actually really entertaining. It takes timing, stealth, reflexes, energy management, etc. It makes for some fun strategy.

[As always, you can view the playlist here.](http://youtu.be/eyB_mCboLWo)

[The newest video is episode 11, here.](http://youtu.be/eyB_mCboLWo)

After multiple good recommendations I did start in this episode to speed up most of the non-punching segments. Things should hopefully be more interesting since you don't have to spend half the video watching me wait for battery recharge or just running around the city and hacking things. Let me know if you guys like it, or if it's too fast or too slow still. (I slow it down for any punches and certain other events.)

Also, thanks again to IlliterateChild for the recommendation on using Explosive Packs in combat. You won't see it yet in any of the videos since I started doing it later (as I've still got about an hour or more of footage that I just need to edit and upload) but it makes fights against large groups of people SO much easier (and more entertaining, I might add). When you throw an explosive pack at someone they'll freak out or jump on the ground. You don't have to detonate it and can just pick it up later. When you have to go into a situation where you need to punch 4 or 5 (or more) people in a room, it helps to distract others with that and then proceed with your punching.

One more thing, unfortunately there are a (relatively small) amount of non-invulnerable people that can't be punched. =( For any like that I'm resorting to using stun gun/PEPs. Kind of lame, I know, but what can I do. Luckily it's a very, very small number compared to those that you can punch.",,False,,t5_2r0qr,False,,,True,t3_uuu3s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/uuu3s/punch_everybody_playthrough_updates/,

I tried to come up with a list of ideas that would improve the game without drastic overhauls (ie, perhaps something a mod team could accomplish, is there a mod scene for this game?). No story spoilers but there are gameplay spoilers I guess.


* An EMP damage upgrade for one of the weapons (probably machine pistol, shotgun or maybe crossbow) that makes it effective against against bots.
* More bots in more areas with computers that are better guarded and so harder to hack.
* Enemies responding better to bots. Hacking bots seemed to be a instant win button when I did it. Some enemies thrown EMP grenades at you but I never saw one throwing one at a bot.
* When a bot is hacked the stealth enemies should cloak and run to the computer and unhack it instead of just shooting it like idiots.
* Enemies that thrown gas grenades should have the gas immunity aug or at least gasmasks.
* Enemies with the x-ray vision aug. They should have no helmets and obviously augmented vision (like Gunther in Deus Ex) so you can pick them out and their cone of vision should be a special colour on the radar whenever they turned the aug on. This would have the dual effect of adding another layer of difficulty to stealth and also making the cone of vision aug more useful.
* Make the aug that doubles the radar range also make the map details show up on the radar.
* Make the radar an upgrade rather than given. Have Sarif give you a paraxis in the flight over to the first mission and ask you how you want to handle it. If you say sneak he advises you to buy radar and if you say go in fighting he suggests aim stabilization or something.
* Make the pheromone release a separate aug to the social enhancer.
* Make the punch through walls upgrade also give the option to punch through locked doors. This would make it a bit of an alternative to having to run around for codes (or waste explosives) for non-hacking characters and make up a bit for the lack of lockpicking.
* Enemies with sprint aug.
* Built in alternative ways of beating the bosses. Something as drastic as the kill phrases from Deus Ex isn't necessary but things like having a hackable security system in a boss arena or some system to be able to flood part of the arena with gas.
* More sidequests including some that are simply impossible to complete without certain playstyles. A sidequest where you have to kill somone. A sidequest where if you're seen it's an instant failure. A sidequest that requires level 4 or 5 hacking etc.
* Heavy-grade enemies using a rocket launcher occasionally in the more open areas (especially in accompanied by large bots)


Edit: I forgot:

* Split the social aug into two seperate augs. One for the pheromones, one for the HUD. I liked being able to use the pheromone ability, but I didn't like the big HUD giving me really obvious hints during the conversations.
* More gameplay/climactic/whatever you call them conversations. Loved them.

After fighting Jaron Namir, the game spirals into almost unplayable bullshit.

First of all, his fight was quite possibly one of the *worst* things I've ever played. ""Hey, here's a fight you can't really prepare for because the choices you made as a character render the majority of weapons useless, but it's okay, because you gots all dem augments. OH WAIT! You fell for that!? LOLLOLOL"" 

Seriously, and this isn't anything that hasn't been said already, but the boss fights are the *worst* thing about this game. Hands fucking down. They're basically from a different game. And taking away the things that made the fights bearable? What. 
The. Fuck.

Like I said, it's nothing that hasn't been said before, so I'll skip ahead.

The final area of the game is poorly designed. Period. You cannot stealth through the game as you would normally, because there's just flat out too many dudes. I suppose you theoretically can, but the level was broken because you can simply turn on stealth and run past everyone. I get that the stealth portions are supposed to be slow and methodical, but it just seems ridiculous that it's not just simpler, but *easier* to run through like a jackass.

The call outs to go save people don't show up on the mini-map either. That was a big problem for me. I shouldn't have to go to youtube just to see where I'm supposed to go. Like the other side missions, it should have popped up in the map.

Finally, a plot hole that really bothered me. So, Zhao made it to Panchea. Cool. I guess? But how? It's max, what? 4 hours since Jensen last saw her? Tops?

IMO, it's a masterpiece. I know some will say blasphemy, and you very well may have a point as I haven't played either the original or DXIW.  With that said, how should the series move forward from here?  Do we explore the timeline from 2027 up until 2057?  Try to bridge the gap in the mythology to give a clearer picture of how society changed by moving from mechanical augmentation towards nano augmentation?  Or better yet, would the community approve of SquareEnix/Edios doing a complete overhaul of the original Deux Ex to bring up to modern standards?  And this may be a long shot, but with that overhaul, they left the story/gameplay untouched with the exception of a few things from the new DXHR.  Like 3rd person cover and the augmentation skill tree.  Or is this a terrible idea as well?  The only reason I say this, is because I believe DXHR has opened up a whole new generation to the DX Universe.  I know that DX and DXIW are still available via Steam and I think the majority of the community would probably say just buy and play those.  But, shouldn't we give Deus Ex the chance to be better than the Prequel and allow this new fan base a chance to play it the way it truly meant to be played?

I came back since some of you requested I do so when starting Deus Ex: Human Revolution.  I create/upload one episode per day on my [YouTube Channel - ChristopherOdd](http://www.youtube.com/christopherodd).

I'm inviting you over to participate in the playthrough, not just to watch it.  I really take into consideration everyone's comments and advice as I feel it makes for a more thorough gameplay, and I love to analyze the story that is unfolding!

Something caught me off gaurd with my last playthrough.  As much as I felt like I explored as much as I could, people asked for MORE exploration.  I've taken that into account as I started Human Revolution so I'm being fairly thorough.  I even developed a ""box addiction"" in the 5th/6th episode, which I have happily kicked now ;) 

I've also provided a Table of Contents for each video in the comments so you can skip to any sections of the video you ilke :)

I'd like to enlist your help...,ChristopherOdd,37,16,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/14rmjk/remember_playing_the_original_deus_ex_for_the/,"Hey everyone, I came here last week to ask about reading the Icarus Effect and I got a ton of great suggestions about the order in which to play the games/read the book.  So thank you for that.


I'd like to give you a quick backstory as to why I'm here.  


I started making Let's Plays on YouTube a few months ago, and the first game I played was Half-Life.  Somebody suggested that I share that LP with the fine folks over at /r/halflife.  Well, that was the best thing I ever did.  Some of those guys came over and became regular commenters that would offer advice, things to pay special attention to, etc.  It made for an amazing experience for myself, and I would receive a lot of messages saying that they rather enjoyed watching someone play through one of their favorite games for the first time.  Since then, I've played through all of the Half Life series, moved on to Portal, Bioshock, and a few other new games that came out.

I'm not here to just drop my channel name looking for views or anything.  I'm looking to invite any willing participants to partake in my first play through of a game that slipped WAY under my radar.  The original Deus Ex is incredibly deep in so many ways.  I often find myself forgetting that this game was created in 2000!  I'd love to have some you Deus Ex veterans come over and see if it's something you'd be interested in following/participating in.  If not, totally cool too.


My intention is to play through Human Revolution after the original Deus Ex is completed :)

Hey everyone! So per the post from last week, I was interested in starting an ""Ironman"" playthrough of Human Revolution (playing through the game without dying). After several humiliating defeats, I decided to just go with a playthrough where I have to merely restart the level I'm on, rather then the entire game (for now). (For example, if I die in Detroit I have to restart to where you first get there, or if I die in Highland Park I have to restart that mission.) I decided to record it and include tips/info as well, in case anybody is interested at all. I'm hoping it will be interesting to both newbies to the game, and those that have played it before.

&gt; In statements posted on the Internet, the ITS expresses particular hostility towards nanotechnology and computer scientists. It claims that nanotechnology will lead to the downfall of mankind, and predicts that the world will become dominated by self-aware artificial-intelligence technology. Scientists who work to advance such technology, it says, are seeking to advance control over people by 'the system'. The group praises Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, whose anti-technology crusade in the United States in 1978–95 killed three people and injured many others.

(...)

&gt; In May, the university received a second parcel bomb, with a message reading: ""This is not a joke: last month we targeted Oscar Camacho, today the institution, tomorrow who knows? Open fire on nanotechnology and those who support it!""

(...)

&gt; To oppose technology is not an unacceptable way to think. We may well debate the desirability of further technical development in our society. Yet radical groups such as the ITS overlook a crucial detail: it is not technology that is the problem, but how we use it. After Alfred Nobel invented dynamite he became a rich man, because it found use in mining, quarrying, construction and demolition. But people can also decide to put dynamite into a parcel and address it to somebody with the intention of killing them.

If you die once, that's it. You delete your save and either start over or give up. [NanosuitNinja on YouTube has done some awesome Ironman playthroughs of Crysis.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1CF57DEC48A0F06)

I'm thinking of new challenges for the game, and am considering doing an Ironman playthrough...it would be difficult, for sure. Especially considering how long the bloody game is. Plus, on Give Me Deus Ex, you can easily get one shot by a shotgun or a headshot with a pistol. It doesn't help that the AI is really accurate at shooting (unrealistically so, honestly). Still, I can't shake the hankering to try it. I think it's definitely possible.

It would need to be largely stealth, I think. Most situations in the game can either be avoided if you're smart, or you can easily take out enemies in a stealthy manner. With some careful planning I could see this being possible, and enjoyable. Trying to think what augs to get, and I think something like this would be a priority:

* Hacking (always, for alternate routes and to take out enemies with hacked turrets and bots)
* Dermal Armor
* Icarus (because there are way too many times where I've accidentally died from fall damage)
* Cloaking
* See through walls

I think those would be the most important, and then the rest could stem from there as needed.

What do you guys think? Anyone want to try it with me? Also, would people be interested in me recording it and posting it on YouTube, ala my [Punch Everybody](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3A844348DAA58E1D) playthrough? I obviously want to finish that eventually as well, it just takes a lot of time to punch everybody, and I feel like I kind of need a bit of variety before moving on with that playthrough. (Honestly I'm a tad burnt out on the punching everybody thing at the moment.)

EDIT: Welp, after spending a good part of the weekend giving this a shot, I think I'm going to give it a rest for now. Guess I'm not as good at this game as I thought! I made it about 3 hours in twice, to DRB territory to shutdown the broadcast signal. It obviously would have been easier if I had just done it stealth, but decided I wanted to have more fun and have an actual firefight. =\

Another example is the holocom. In HR, they moved around like real people but in Deus Ex they were displayed on a projector and couldn't move around (I'm not even considering DX:IW)

Those two were just from the top of my head but there were many other instances in the game which made HR feel more technologically advanced.  How so?

Maybe some online attention will get Eidos to give a crap about it.

Hundreds of people who bought Deus Ex for the PC (with entirely different computers, lots of them very high-end builds that don't choke on anything) are getting a huge ""stutter"" issue when moving the game's camera at a ""new area"" (and the game seems to think any area you weren't just staring at five seconds ago is new). For some, it's a minor annoyance. For many, it drops so many frames when simply moving the camera around it makes the game unplayable.

Just on the Deus Ex and Steam forums alone there are two topics that have ninety-seven thousand views:

http://forums.eidosgames.com/showthread.php?t=119684&amp;page=21
http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2075294&amp;page=34

Someone also recently just started a online petition that has nearly 200 signatures already:

http://www.petitiononline.com/DEHRStut/petition.html

The issue is also all over YouTube:

http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=deus+ex+stutter

and many people (myself included) have sent support emails over 10 days ago to Eidos, who stopped replying as soon as the stuttering was mentioned.

They refuse to say even a single word - acknowledge the problem or let us know a patch is on the way. So basically we're all short 50 bucks and we've got nothing of value in return.

Interestingly, Black Ops had this same problem until a few months after release - Activision wouldn't acknowledge it was a problem in the way the game's coding handled loading, so people went to extreme lengths to try and fix something they couldn't possibly fix, only to wait months for an actual fix.

My preview copy didn't come with a special NDA of any kind so everything in it should be open to discussion.""

-----------------------------------------------------------
* **here's some suggestions I have that aren't platform specific: see how much you have to commit to playing one way through a level. For example, does the game punish you if you just sneak in to the middle of a facility and then start firing all of a sudden while surrounded from all sides? Or are enemies only very locally aware?**

If you get surrounded by enemies and get detected, you're dead. Guns are so powerful you can only take a couple of seconds worth of shots before going down. There's nothing stopping you from shooting and sneaking in turns, and actually you have to move around during combat quite a bit.



* **Check out the skill tree, does it feel like the praxis points come easy? Does it feel like you could max everything out? Or do you have to specialise?**

Some really powerful augs have been announced, like the one that aims for you. Does it break the game to get it, is it easy to get early in the game?
Praxis points are pretty hard to come by so far. After ~two hours of playtime I've received a total of two. Most upgrades already cost two points. Hard to say how it'll scale later on.


*** If you get to see it, can the ""punch through wall"" aug be used anywhere or in specific marked spots? Does it also deform the terrain, allowing new routes? (sorry if this has been answered before)**

Haven't tried that yet, but I wouldn't think it would deform the terrain. Doesn't seem like the engine would support that.


* **The latest round of f--ing sperging discussion about this game is that every room has you hiding behind a crate playing whack-a-mole. If you could confirm/deny this, that would be appreciated.**

Kind of yes. I mean it's a cover shooter. You sit in cover and shoot dudes. But you can't sit in place. Enemies pack so much firepower and know how to aim at your hiding place that you'll get your ass off if you sit in place and pop up to shoot, so you kind of have to move around a bit.

But like I said, it's a cover shooter.


*  **Just a practical overview of how both sneaking and gunplay work and feel, how easy or hard it is to swap from one to another while under fire.**

Sneaking works much like in Deus Ex. Move while crouched, use natural cover, don't get seen. Guns are kind of loose to aim but feel very powerful. You can easily swap from one to another: pressing RMB glues you to cover, letting go unglues you. As long as enemies don't actually see you, you can move around them to flank while they blast at your old hiding place.


* **Any info on how much the story changes and how people treat you depending on what you do would be awesome, even if it's just the ""cause"" part of cause and effect.**

Haven't seen reactions change yet. I've been a sarcastic and argumentative  towards my boss but his attitude hasn't changed. 


* **- If you'll be playing a sufficient slice of the story, just an overall impression on the writing, characterization and stuff like that.**

The writing and story seem very cyberpunk 101. Evil corporations, discussion on what humanity means and how replacing your body with metal might affect that.


* ** - As others have mentioned, just how far would 10k credits carry you? Just some examples of how much stuff costs to get a feeling for it**.


10K is a decent chunk of change, but won't break the game. I have like 1500 credits right now, guns cost ~1000 credits.


* **- Ammo, what kinds are there for which kinds of weapons, how plentiful or scarce.**

 Haven't seen any non-standard ammo yet, but it IS all separated by gun type, so no universal ammo anymore. The enemies I've seen so far have used handguns and machine pistols, so ammo for those is plentiful. Ammo for everything else is hell of scarce.


* **Grenades, what kinds, how do they feel, how does the mechanic of make-your-own-mines work.**

Haven't tried making mines yet, but grenades are just as you'd imagine. I've seen a flashbang and a frag grenade so far. Both seemed very powerful.


* **Praxis points, the rate of XP gathering, what gives you XP, trying out various loop-holes like knocking out a guard, letting a buddy revive him, separate them and knocking him out again aka does it still generate XP, if they can be purchased as software and how much does it cost if you go that route.**

Praxis points come slow, as does XP. You get XP for completing objectives, killing dudes (extra for headshots), traveling through hidden routes etc. I'll try that exploit 


* **- Inventory, how much stuff do you accumulate while playing, what kind of stuff can you pick up, possible foodstuffs, drinks, booze etc.**

Inventory kind of sucks. Playing Tetris with all the stuff you come across isn't very much fun and there's so much  you come across that you have to dump most of it.

* **A general take on level design and routes, how natural or artificial does it feel, how destructible is stuff you find, how feasible would making your own routes be, etc...**

Levels feel good. A facility might have two or three corridors leading into the same warehouse, and possibly a hidden air duct adding a fourth route into the mix. It's usually not a great idea to take the most obvious route, as your enemies will probably have it covered. Nothing feels destructible at all so far.


* **How aggressive the AI is in flanking or flushing you out, just how realistic are the whack-a-mole worries.**

The AI isn't very aggressive. They're happy to sit in cover and take potshots while one dude tries to rush you. Maybe this changes as they go from low level thugs to professionals, though?


* **- If you'll be playing the PC version, just how feasible would it be to never engage the cover mechanic and just hide behide stuff manually (I know some people who would LOVE to know this).**

Playing PC, and that is not very feasible at all. The game is a cover-based shooter. If you try to manually duck and stand up to shoot, you'll probably get your ass shot off in a hurry.

* **A bit of an insight into the rewards for being an explorationist would be nice, same as what kind of emails and books and such can you find.**

So far the rewards seem to be mostly fluff, but there's some in game stuff in there too, like maybe a clue on where you can find an air duct to go around the corridor with two turrets in it. 


* **...how does the purchasing system actually work? Is is in-conversation or a Fallout-style buying screen (or something completely different)? Do you mainly buy from respectable shops, or are you primarily procuring equipment from dodgy weirdos who don't seem to understand the concept of setting even vaguely consistent prices?**

It's a buying screen which works much like the PS3's XMB. You scroll horizontally between categories and vertically through items in that category. So far I've bought mostly from shady street dealers, who seem to be engaged in some kind of price fixing. 


* **I know it's kind of an abstract question, but does it capture the feel/spirit of the first DX? In that I mean, you feel rewarded for exploring, have to think out an approach, plan, etc. Or are the alternate paths so obviously pointed out it's usually a decision of 'well do I fight or stealth' through this section.**

No, it feels a lot subtler than that. The levels are laid out in pretty realistic fashion and often it's not immediately clear which is the stealthy option and which the combat option. You have to feel around and try to figure out where the enemies are and then react accordingly.


* **More importantly though, is the game fun?**

It's fun. I'm not quite in the ""amazing"" territory yet but I'm hoping it'll get there.

* **also how stupid are the takedowns? does that animation get old?**

There seem to be quite a few of them. 


* **One last question, have you played Mass Effect 2 at all? How similar, if at all do the two games feel in terms of level design?**

Oh yes, extensively. I wouldn't say they feel similar at all. There's waist high barriers of course, but they're not as obviously telegraphed as in ME2 -- at least not yet.

The first level is a large office building / warehouse and the shelves, desks etc feel natural. In ME2 you know that every time you see barriers, you're in for combat. Not so here.


* **What difficulty are you playing at, and how did you do? I wanna hear if I'm as bad as I fear.**

Normal. I always play review games on normal the first time around, or whatever the ""this is how the game is intended to be played"" setting is. The biggest problem I've had so far is falling to my death. That fall death height is surprisingly low!

But I figured I'd put this out here in case we got some fans in the audience.

I've been working with NVShacker (TNM programmer and also a redditor) on a new update for the mod. The main point of it is to ensure full compatibility with the upcoming full release of HDTP (I know the HDTP guys, and it really is on its way, you'll just have to take my word for it), but while we're at it, and in order to procrastinate from serious stuff, I've been randomly adding new content to the mod as well. I've added some functional content like making all the other apartments in the first level enterable or adding new enterable apartments to the Slums, giving Aemer's apartment a kitchen, etc. I've also been adding some cosmetic content like animated grass or new textures for the unique weapons, and finally NVShacker and I have of course both been fixing what few niggles and glitches still remained after the 1.0.4+ patch.

So... while I'm at it, and because I really like working on TNM whenever I have nothing else to do, let me know if you've played the mod and you have any requests for stuff to add or improve. I can't guarantee I'll act on your requests, but just cut loose - nothing is too ridiculous to consider, and if I decide against something you suggest, I'll do my best to explain why.

It's a huge level filled with zombies and then there's two rooms - one with Taggart and one with Sarif in it. Meh.

But most of all I disliked the way the ending was presented. ""Choose your ending by pressing one of four buttons!"" Really?? That was a tad disappointing.

Nonetheless I liked the ending videos themselves a lot! I struggled between Hugh Darrow's ending and the destruction of panchea - in the end I chose the *Destruct Panchea*-ending for myself.

* When you upgrade a weapon, only that *specific* weapon is upgraded.
* When you pick up a weapon and already have another of the same type, upgrades are automatically **merged** from both of them.
* AFAIK you will never ever find an already-upgraded weapon ""in the wild"". The only way for an upgraded weapon to be on the ground is if you were the one who dropped it.
* Arms-dealers will *not* give you any extra money when you sell them a ""generically"" upgraded weapon

Merging Example:

0. Start with Shorgun #1 in you inventory.
1. Upgrade Shotgun #1 with a damage mod.
2. Drop Shotgun #1.
3. Pick up Shotgun #2.
4. Upgrade Shotgun #2 with a burst-fire mod.
5. Pick up Shotgun #1 again, and you'll see a message saying you picked up a damage-mod as well.
6. Check your inventory, and both shotguns have ""merged"" into a single shotgun that has both the damage mod **and** the burst-fire mod.

So while you still need to carry ""good guns"" for the whole game to keep their upgrades, you never have to worry about what happens when picking up weapons, since the game always ""merges"" their upgrades (and ammo-counts) in the best possible way.

I'm attempting to go much, much deeper than most wikis or other information sources do -- to unravel most every conspiracy and explain a lot of the technology behind Deus Ex.

A little more background: I did a standard playthrough of DX -- stealthy, hacking and lockpicking everywhere, and reading every possible deivce, book, terminal, e-mail, PSA...everything, and writing down anything I thought to be significant. Undoubtedly, this was quite a lot (57 8.5x11's [albeit in a decent sized handwriting!]). I'm now going through, page by page, and analyzing everything as holistically as possible -- linking everything back and forth through the game's plot and backstory. I'm taking hints from a script dump on GameFAQs, Stephan T. Lavavej's page on nuwen.net, and a rehost of the Deus Ex bible. Wikipedia itself has been a huge help, too!

The project is to be hosted on shoutwiki or wikia, but not much has been done there yet. The project has been digitized from my original notes, and analysis is moving at a fair pace; Page 37.

I hope to be done in time for the launch of DX3 (which I sadly will not be able to partake in). I am ** *not* ** treating DX2 as canon.

Anyway, on with the preview bit -- here's what I most recently finished from Page 37:
&gt; ==Further Analysis==

&gt; The Universal Constructor, still hypothetical today, is a fascinating piece of technology. Assembling anything, everything, in seconds, on command. Astonishing -- the possibilities would be endless. As a class of Von Neumann devices, ""Molecular Assemblers"", being the central idea behind a UC, but not a UC itself, can replicate themselves as well. RNA and ribosomes fit this bill. 

&gt; The technology which powers a large portion of this game's narrative is also central to the player character and primary antagonists. Replication of the cells behind nano-augged agents, the ''machines'', is made possible by the same ideas put forth behind a Universal Constructor. In a way, JC, Page, Simons, and Tong are all ** *Universal Constructors* **. I think one of the biggest cases in point is the killswitch: an unchecked, exponential replication of cells and machines, resulting in such a powerful shock to the system that the human itself shuts down. Not only are JC and Paul killing machines, they are, more or less, biological weapons of mass destruction. As the Gray Death or nano-augmentations in them explode in numbers, should they lose limbs or a decent quantity of blood, the Gray Death multiplies and expands, essentially creating more of itself with the whole world as its petri dish. 24 hours is also fairly arbitrary and slow; UNATCO could simply have programmed it to be an instantaneous replication of every machine and every cell, killing the twins within a few minutes. Naturally, however, this would make getting to Hong Kong and deactivating it quite tricky though!

And [here's a link to the project itself, starting at Page 1](http://tpp.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Page_1). I wanted to give you all a first look because you're reddit's official DX community! Unfortunately, shoutwiki has been down since late June, so edits have been impossible beyond page 7.

Aside from all the praise I've heard over the years, it's a good sign when a game has an active modding community over a decade after its release.

I've followed [this guide](http://www.somethingfornobody.com/2011/deus-ex-modding-guide/), which seems to cover all the bases. I'm running the Steam GOTY edition on Win7. I had no problem installing each mod, and checked that the game ran fine with each one. Just as I was in the home stretch, I had a problem with [Deus Ex Enhanced](http://www.moddb.com/mods/deus-ex-enhanced/downloads), which fixes the non-scaling default UI. It works too well! The clean, anti-aliased fonts are beautiful, but the UI is now *slightly* larger than my screen. This is a real shame, because without this mod, the menus and font are pretty damn cramped.

I couldn't find any information on how to adjust the scale of the UI with Deus Ex Enhanced, so I'm worried it's a one-size fits all fix. I tried editing the .ini at FullscreenViewportX and FullscreenViewportY to try and match my display size (1366x768, because my laptop can't go any higher), but this didn't affect the UI scale. Any tips? Other mods that might cover this?

(DX3),lurking_bishop,18,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/vuctz/how_many_aug_points_will_i_miss_on_if_i_dont/,"I am a Deus Ex veteran having played DX1 excessively and also a playthrough of DX2. I bought DX3 at the steam sale and just recovered the Typhoon.

So far, I did my best to only do stealth stuns attacks because they give the most XP etc. I am starting to find it a bit tedious though. Obiously, DX3 is intended to be a stealth game but sometimes, jumping around to silently take out two guards when a single shotgun blast or a grenade would have killed both seems to be just silly

Furthermore the Aug system doesn't make much sense to me right now. There are augs (i.e the hacking) which are important regardless if you play violent or stealth, so those should be prioritized. But If I play silently I get enough points to also unlock the ""violent"" augs which I don't need because I play stealth. On the other hand, If I'm allowing myself to just blast a couple of guys off the radar I'm missing out on XP which could ultimately lead to me not being able to complete Augs I'd want to have

So my question becomes this: How many extra Aug points is it worth to always get the silent Objectives?

Essentially, it's possible to fire some weapons as quickly as you can tap a button. While shooting, if you switch in and out of cover mode rapidly your weapon will fire each time you come out of cover.

For the life of me everytime I hit ""Q"", nothing happens. She just sits there. I've confirmed that I can shoot or stun her, but I can't punch. If somebody could test it, that would help me know if my game is bugged, or if that particular NPC is just bugged. (Reloading or re-entering the area didn't seem to help.) She's in that little hobo area near where you can try and get the rocket launcher in Derelict Row.

For the second, there's a guy that seems to be in a room that I can't get access to. For some reason he can hear me through the walls, and can even shoot me through the wall. I can see him clip through them as well. I can't find that room at all, and think it's inaccessible...can anybody confirm whether or not you can get to this room, or whether they've seen the same issue?

Not only do you get more XP for taking enemies down with the tranquilizer rifle/stun gun, but tranqs/stuns are one-hit knockouts on ALL organic enemies regardless of armor and are completely silent. In addition, the ""Smooth Operator"" and ""Ghost"" XP bonuses are closely tied with playing non-lethally (they're MUCH more difficult to get using lethal measures) whereas there are no combat equivelent bonuses like ""Rambo"" or ""Blood-thirsty"" to be found AND there are several achievements/trophies specifically for not killing anyone but none for the other way around.

Added on to that, there are takedowns. A non-lethal takedown is completely silent (you can take a guy out right next to his buddy and he wont even notice) whereas a lethal takedown makes almost as much noise as a gunshot. That makes absolutely no sense to me. Why does choking a guy out, breaking his arm and flipping him onto the ground make no noise, but stabbing a guy through the chest, slitting his throat and knocking him to the ground sends guards running all the way from the next room? It's not like the potential for unconscious guards to be woken up is that much of a risk, as either way you're going to be hiding your bodies to keep alarms from being raised (assuming you're taking a stealth-combat approach, as I am).

This is one of my few principle issues with DXHR (aside from this, I think it's one of the best games of the year).

I listened to his side of the story and it sounded a tad bit similar to what Ben Saxon had gone through before he was accepted as a member of the Tyrants.
Just like Saxon he was also an outstanding member of his team back when he worked for the US government, they saw his potential and tricked him into working for some secret organization (Illuminati, I'm guessing) where he was made to assassinate certain people then have his memory wiped of the whole event. Saxon also had similar things happen to him. He worked for Belltower, best in his sqaud, gets his whole team killed, tyrants recruit him by tricking him into believing that he will get revenge against the people responsible.
Now, I think that this was a way for the Tyrants to recruit Zelazny. If Zelazny hadn't rebelled and gone rogue, he could have been accepted as a member of the Tyrants.

I still enjoyed the original more but the game was excellent nonetheless.

However, I am disappointed with the lack of closure and missing ties that brings Human Revolution closer to Deus Ex 1.  Rather than the game being a prequel, to me it just feels like it's a game that takes place before the events of Deus Ex 1 but not a true prequel.  [Here's why(Spoilers):](/s ""There is no explanation of the formation of UNATCO, NSF, or why Megan has suddenly or perhaps been backstabbing Adam all this time.  It shouldn't have to take a scene after the credits to show who she really was.  The game also barely explains the origins of Manderly or Bob Page.  I can only believe this may confuse players who never played the first game as to who Bob even is since they only showed him once in the beginning.  More importantly, who really is Adam Jensen?  We are left not to know how he was made into what he is.  Why is a superior being with DNA that doesn't have rejection effects to augmentations?  Spontaneous evolution?  His background is pretty brief in a sidequest and in explained in some e-mails but I feel like this was overlooked a lot.  We learn little of the Illuminati's plan from augmentation to suddenly changes focus to the Grey Death in the first for population control nor the birth of nanotechnology.  While this is explained in some backstory readings of DX1, I still feel it is left out in DX:HR.  There are some other weird plot issues I found to be bothering me but nothing as big as those."")

I feel like either I may have missed some small things or maybe they have plans for a sequel to Human Revolution that takes place before Deus Ex 1 again.  If anyone can elaborate on some of this stuff, I feel like it wasn't properly explained or even explained at all.

The crude augmentations you see in Deus Ex are an in-between phase, prior to nanobots which can rebuild things on an atomic level.

The question is: Why bother to go along the complex route of human and machine merger if machines themselves can far surpass humans as a new species?

A cyborg (part human and machine) is second at best to advanced, pure sentient machines in the far future.


Deus Ex Machina (God from the Machine) = a machine with god-like powers, would be the ultimate manifestation of the abilities of sentient machines, and a god-like entity on Earth.

I started this subreddit about 2 years ago, mostly because no one else had and I felt if any place needs a DE forum, it's definitely Reddit (I was shocked no one had already made one, being how much I would see it mentioned).  It's been a nice quiet community that had slowly grown to about 150 subs up until about a month ago.  As to be expected, subs went up a bit as anticipation for HR grew, I think it was up to 250 last weekend.  Then the release hit, and suddenly the subs went up to almost 600 literally overnight - tonight we broke 800!  

Thought you guys might like seeing some of the [recent traffic stats](http://i.imgur.com/6OpPH.png).  It's funny how you can see exactly when the US ~~and the European releases~~ [edit: my mistake, Euro not released yet] occured. 

I particularly want to thank the mod Little_Robot for his work on redesigning the subreddit CSS for HR release, I think it looks fantastic!   

So, welcome again, it's been a great community so far and hopefully will only get better with the new people!  Thanks for visiting!   ",,False,,t5_2r0qr,True,,,True,t3_jtmov,http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/jtmov/a_welcome_to_new_visitors_and_some_fun_traffic/,moderator

However, I fear I've commited a mortal gaming sin. For a reason I can make no excuse for, the original Deus Ex has completely passed me by.

I've always heard how incredible it is from fans as well as knowing of it's numerous awards and nominations... But, I've never got around to playing it.

But, that may change very soon! I'm considering LPing it Blind (having never played it before) but with Deus Ex being quoted as quite a deep game I was wondering it there's anything you vets can tell me to make sure I don't shoot myself in the foot from the start.

What skills should I train/avoid at the start?

Are there any (un)official patches/mods that are a must?

Would you guys want me to let you know when I release the first video, relive the first time with me again?

I know that I missed the Praxis near the start - I checked a bunch of areas on the ship near where I began, but I didn't find any - were they in a really obvious location?

Apart from those minor quoibles, I rather enjoyed it. Quinn is one hell of a character.

Oh, and just out of interest - if I had chosen to save the civilians instead of the scientist, how would the story have changed?

So as you head into the convention center in the mission to find out where Sandoval went you have the option of going up an escalator. Now, the left side of the escalator has a Chinese man repairing it. If you talk to the Chinese man he will respond with the line ""It is admirable to see someone....such as yourself..taking an interest in our work"" which is exactly the same line as one of the Chinese Tai Young Medical scientists will give you.

At one point, while I was finding the final technician, there were rooms on either side of the hallway filled with test patients that are moaning and groaning as Adam walks by: I assumed their bodies were rejecting augmentation implants. 

I decided after finding the lab tech and getting the next mission checkpoint, to go back and tranquilize each and every one of the patients, so they wouldn't have to go through the torment. My reward? Every single one of them (male and female) made sounds as if they were having an orgasm for about 4-7 seconds right before they stopped moving.

I have tried to play it several times in recent years but it failed to keep my attention.

After finishing HR, I thought it would be easier to get into, and am trying again. But it's frustrating. The main problem I have is it's hard to be stealthy. I keep getting spotted by security cameras I didn't even know were there. It's hard and time consuming to sneak up behind someone patrolling because my sneak speed is only slightly higher than their walking speed. I do like that I have to hit them in the back of the head with the baton to knock them out, but it doesn't seem to work half the time, even with low-tech weapons on trainer and the first level strength aug. When I take someone out with the silenced pistol, its hard to know if people in the area will go hostile or not. It's hard to see where guards are without revealing your location to them.

All this leads to a million quick saves / quick loads and not much fun in the middle.
