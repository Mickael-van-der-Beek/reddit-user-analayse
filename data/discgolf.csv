They said they were interested and would talk more extensively with their team about it. I expect to hear from them within the week. I'm not sure if they'll ask for a design, or if they'll make a design themselves. I also suggested to them that they make a post themselves when the time is right. I suppose the mods will need to help out with that. Anyway, now that the ball is rolling, who is actually interested in buying an official reddit disc from Millennium? The more support we can show, the more likely they will go through with this.

1337221222.0,169,self.discgolf,tr0gm,Would you guys be interested in an AMA from world champ Avery Jenkins?,MrAnderson7,196,27,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/tr0gm/would_you_guys_be_interested_in_an_ama_from_world/,"Today I had the opportunity to work as a throw marker for the world distance championship held at UCSC. A bunch of the pros were there - Nate Doss, Avery Jenkins, and Jeremy Koling to name a few. Avery Jenkins is making a big push spread the word about the sport (check out his posts and videos at http://www.discmania.net/) and I told him that we have a growing disc golf community here on reddit. He has never heard of the site, but he seemed pretty interested in doing a Q&amp;A, and I thought it might be a good way to connect with the online discing community and to get the word out about this awesome sport.

I am hoping to get a good mix to technical questions from us here in /r/discgolf as well as questions from people new to the sport.  He just took home another distance championship medal and he is one of the best players out there right now. Do you guys think it would be worth asking him?

Edit: If you have any preliminary questions, please by all means write 'em down!

**Update 5/17**: I just send him an email letting him know we are interested. He is pretty active online but I wouldn't expect him to have the time this week since the Master's cup is this weekend. Keep checking back and I'll try to get a date set.

1311606861.0,125,self.discgolf,iz899,Wish me luck /r/Discgolf - Pitching my course to the county this afternoon...,CRoswell,139,14,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/iz899/wish_me_luck_rdiscgolf_pitching_my_course_to_the/,"Some of you may remember my post from back in April [asking for general advice on course design.](http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/gakh1/i_am_involved_in_the_planning_stage_of_creating_a/) I'm working with a local non-profit recreation project (my basic goal there is to provide alternatives to baseball and soccer because growing up I didn't care for the ""traditional"" sports.)

I've been fighting tooth and nail with the county parks executive. He doesn't want the course in ""his"" hardwood forest. Even though he doesn't live anywhere near the park and never sets foot out there. 

We (and our course designer) view the forest as wasted space, and a perfect location for an intermediate / advanced level course. Currently the area only has beginner level courses within a 1 hour radius, so this course would fill a great need. The County Park Exec wanted to put the course along the river in a wide open area that is shared space with playgrounds, busy pavillions, etc. Basically a danger zone just begging for injury and a really boring layout. Not something worth spending $10k on. Fund raising is hard in such a small town (we average about $1k / night for a LOT of time investment,) and we're not about to spend all of that money on a lame course that will not be used.

I plan to have a couple more experienced DG'ers demo 2 holes for the county board using two practice baskets, and I will walk the executives through some of the rest of the course. It all depends how long they're willing to stay and how much they're willing to walk through the hordes of bugs. Most of them have never even seen someone play disc golf.

There are a few areas that the Parks Executive has ""issues"" with, so I plan to discuss those head-on and show the county board the locations that he is concerned with. He is concerned with discs flying into a neighboring golf course. Not really an issue because of the 40 yards+ of a solid of trees between the two areas. Basically it is a great argument looking at a map, but once you get boots on the ground, there is no valid concern to be had.

A little more info about the course:
Based on the advice from my prior post we turned over the initial design to someone who lives, eats, and breathes DG. The guy is an absolute NUT. He has played courses all over the US and annually takes a 2 week ""road trip"" where he gets 36+ holes a day. He focused on the design, I focused on playing devil's advocate and working to get the county's permission. We've mapped out lefty holes, righty holes, short technical holes, double tee pad placement to cater to beginners and still have the pro-tees be challenging and technical. Also 2 pin placements for almost every hole. 

The course is cutting through a hard wood forest, but since we were out there in April, the course was designed around already existing natural fairways. This course really is a work of art. It may not be the best course in the world, but as well as it flows through the natural areas we had to work with... wow. Just wow... We won't have to remove a single mature tree (outside of dead limbs.)

So yea... I'm nervous and can't focus at work today... I sparred with this guy at the last county meeting, and the board deemed it worthy of a ""field trip"" to the location that is about 20 miles away, so here I am, staring down 3ish months of work and time spent. 

I'd appreciated some good vibes if you've got 'em to spare...


edit - Wow, thanks for all the upvotes (self post, so no whorin here) and the well wishings. I'm off to get some food and some stuff for work, then I'm off to the course!!

I'll report back once I know more, but that may not be until Aug 10th when they meet and vote on the course application.",,False,self,t5_2qk68,True,,,True,t3_iz899,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/iz899/wish_me_luck_rdiscgolf_pitching_my_course_to_the/,

1363139461.0,114,self.discgolf,1a6sk0,Public Service Announcement: Don't Be That Guy,Allurex,124,10,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/1a6sk0/public_service_announcement_dont_be_that_guy/,"Hello, everyone! An interesting thing took place this past weekend at a tournament, and I figured I'd share with some notes about proper tournament etiquette. I won't mention where this tournament was, and I definitely won't mention the names of anyone involved.

I played a PDGA Sanctioned tournament and someone was intentionally playing in a division lower than where they should have been. We were playing on a Par 60 course in rainy conditions, and this person shot a 63, which ended up being over a 950 rated round. For reference, players rated 935+ are required to be playing in the Advanced Division (in Sanctioned Events), but this person was playing Intermediate.

Normally there would be no kind of issue with this, people have good rounds and it's entirely possible that this guy just shot better than he usually does. Further, this person was not a PDGA Member, so it's possible that it was his first tournament and simply didn't know which division to play in.

I ended up running into and talking to this guy before the 2nd round, and had a casual conversation about the previous round. Unfortunately, this guy was a veteran Disc Golfer, who sometimes plays and does well in the Advanced Division. Instead, he usually plays in Intermediate just so that he can win. He has even avoided joining the PDGA so that he can play in whatever division he wants; because without a PDGA Rating, a member can play in any division.

Some notable quotes from this person-

* ""I didn't drive 3 hours to play in this tournament and get 3rd or 4th in Advanced, I came to win""

* ""Those guys are lucky I didn't decide to play in the Rec division and sweep that""

Along with more similar rantings. The point being, this person knew that they could play in and cash in Advanced, but he intentionally played in a lower division to win 1st. 

Remember, I'm definitely not telling you all that you should play in a higher division where you don't feel comfortable. If you've been cashing in Intermediate, but still don't feel like you would do well in Advanced, then by all means stay in Intermediate until you do. What you **shouldn't** do is play in a lower division than you know you really should. If you know you will win Intermediate handily, then you should probably play in Advanced. 

I'm also not saying that you need to join the PDGA so that you have a rating. I know that not everyone wants to be a PDGA Member, maybe you can't afford it, or maybe you don't play very many sanctioned events. If you decide not to join the PDGA, just make sure you don't make that decision specifically to avoid having a PDGA Rating. 

Further, this discussion really only applies to people who have played in tournaments before. If you've never played in a tournament, then you obviously don't know for sure what division you belong in. If you are playing in a tournament for the first time, make an informed decision about what division you think is best for you. If you aren't sure, ask other players and the Tournament Director for their advice.

To summarize, the Do's and Dont's of Disc Golf Tournaments.

* **DO** Play Disc Golf Tournaments (Local and Sanctioned both)!
* **DO** Play in a division where you feel comfortable.
* **DO** Join the PDGA if you want to. Membership has many benefits and having a player Rating is just one of them.
* **DON'T** Play in a division lower than the one you know you should be playing in.
* **DON'T** Play in a lower division because you want to win 1st place instead of 3rd/4th or so in the higher division.
* **DON'T** Avoid joining the PDGA just so that you can play in whatever division you want. The PDGA isn't for everyone but that's a bad reason to not join.",,False,self,t5_2qk68,1363199281.0,,,True,t3_1a6sk0,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/1a6sk0/public_service_announcement_dont_be_that_guy/,moderator
1361326322.0,112,self.discgolf,18uy06,ANNOUNCEMENT: /r/DiscGolf Summer Secret Santa Coming!,Allurex,128,16,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/18uy06/announcement_rdiscgolf_summer_secret_santa_coming/,"**(This is a self-post for which I will receive no Karma, please upvote so that others may see)**

Hello everyone! I want to announce that in the upcoming months, we at /r/DiscGolf will be having a Summer Secret Santa! 

This is an idea that has been thrown around a handful of times, but with no real solution to how it would be run, and the lack of someone to run it. As a Moderator in /r/discexchange, and the one who handles the Reputation List, it seemed to me that I'd be the perfect one to set something like this up.

Here's how things will work (to avoid a long paragraph, I'll do bullet-points)-

* **To participate, a member must have at least 3 positive points of feedback on /r/discexchange's [Reputation List](http://www.reddit.com/r/discexchange/comments/qve8l/community_page_reputation_list/) (For more information, see comments).**
* Signups will open at the beginning of April, and continue for the rest of the month.
* To Signup, members will send an email to a dedicated Email account with their information and wish list.
* Wish lists must be reasonable, no requesting $100 discs. Be realistic. (More information on wish lists in comments)
* The first week of May, I will do the matching, similar to how Reddit's Secret Santa already functions. (More information on matching below).
* Once you receive your match and information (through both Email and PM on Reddit), you will have about 6 weeks to get and ship your gift (Final dates yet to be determined).
* Members will need to confirm that they shipped their gift, getting a tracking number.
* Members will need to confirm once they receive their own gift.
* Members who successfully complete Secret Santa will receive a point of positive feedback.
* Members who **do not** successfully complete Secret Santa will be banned from /r/discexchange, barring extenuating circumstances.

These are all just basic details, more concrete and detailed information will come out when Registration Opens at the beginning of April.

**The further information on those points is in the comments (I tried to save space). Please upvote those comments so that everyone can see them. Feel free to discuss those points under those comments if you want to.**

If you have any questions, please ask!

**IMPORTANT EDIT:** After I looked into it, I have decided to allow previous participation in RedditGifts exchanges as qualification for our Secret Santa. So if you have done Reddit Secret Santa or any of the many other exchanges on RedditGifts, that will qualify you for /r/discgolf Secret Santa if you want to participate. When the time comes to register, you will need to include your RedditGifts username (even if it is the same as your Reddit Username), and I can check to see that you have completed exchanges on their platform.

To summarize, there are now 2 possible criteria for participation-
 
* Have at least 3 positive feedback on the /r/discexchange reputation list.
* Have previously (succesfully) completed a gift exchange on RedditGifts.

You don't need to meet both of these criteria to participate, just one.",,False,self,t5_2qk68,1362116731.0,,,True,t3_18uy06,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/18uy06/announcement_rdiscgolf_summer_secret_santa_coming/,moderator

I went up to Cleveland for the 4th and before heading back to Columbus I stopped at a local shop and bought an MVP Anode, so naturally when I got home I wanted to try it out.  I was going to play Hoover but being pressed for time I decided to play a quick round at Blendon.  I putted with the Anode on a few of the holes, but I decided to drive with it for the first time on #7.  Little did I know that my first real throw with that disc would be my first ever ace in almost 12 years of playing!  I was pretty much speechless when it happened, but man it was awesome.  Also shot -6 for the round!

It's a pretty short hole on a short, easy course, but I am damn proud of it.  I've been playing much longer than any of my friends and they've all aced before me, so it feels great to finally join the club!

Last week I had my disc golf bag stolen out of my car in Tacoma. It was a nearly brand new Gorilla Boy simian, that I had waited 4 months to get, by far the best bag I've ever owned, filled with 20 discs, including a number that I had had for over 4 years. Needless to say, I was crushed, unlike a lot of other competitive disc golfers, I didn't have any back up discs, and with a shoestring college student budget, I was afraid that it would be months before I could afford to re-stock any semblance of a tournament-ready bag. That night I posted that my bag had been stolen on the main NW disc golf forum, asking people to keep an eye out on Craigslist for my bag. The next morning I woke up and people started asking for my molds, wanting to help replace what I'd lost. Then yesterday I got a new discraft bag filled with new discs from an amazing local TD, as well as several other people sending extra discs they had. I've been so incredibly floored by the generosity and kind spirit of the disc golf community and the folks who have graciously lent a hand. It's good to know that for every mean individual out there jacking people's stuff, there are always more kind-hearted people making the world a little brighter.",,False,self,t5_2qk68,False,,,True,t3_pr9j0,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/pr9j0/disc_golf_community_helps_restore_faith_in/,

I was in middle school, and a high school friend of mine and I were [Geocaching](http://www.geocaching.com/). We'd found a couple of spots and were heading back to the car from a cache that was in a public park. Near the car, there was a field of college guys throwing a frisbee around, and it landed near my feet. 

My friend (sarcastically) said, ""Hey, you should help them out and throw it back to them!"" Thinking hey, yeah, I'm a nice person and I'll do that, I picked up the disc and sent it back their way. Immediately there was much yelling and anger from their end, and a few of the guys started running towards me. My friend and I bolted to the car and peeled out of there, still under pursuit.

I was so confused and scared, and then my friend explained to me through laughter about the game of disc golf, and how I'd completely ruined their game.

I was out there this weekend, going through my grandmother's estate, a generally depressing task. Before I went, I found that there was a course on the island, and threw a few discs in my bag.

Sunday morning came around, and it was kind of dreary and raining. My first thought was to give up on disc, and I spent the morning driving around the island, reliving old memories. On a whim, I decided to stop by the course on my way back down, and I found a crowd of around a dozen players hanging out on the first tee. So I got out and asked what was up? I happened to show up just in time for their weekly random doubles league. I took that as a sign, grabbed my discs and went out with them. Had a great time throwing discs in the cold rain. :)

This is a disc I made on my wood lathe out of honduras mahogany.  It only weighs a measly 115 g, but it does fly surprisingly well.  The profile is copied from a wraith.  I broke the first one of these I made when it hit some rocks on a landing, so this is the replacement.  Wood is obviously not as sturdy as plastic (notice the scratches and chips on the edge from the few times I've played with it), but I think it's pretty novel.  I also made one out of walnut for my coworker who plays with me... it was only 98 g, but it was much sturdier than the mahogany and can sail ridiculously far when the wind doesn't throw it.

I was talking to some friends while driving home from a wedding in North Carolina this past week and they recommended me trying disc golf (despite none of them actually doing it) as we have a few local courses and were under the impression it is fairly inexpensive. I was looking for some advice or guidance towards an affordable starting kit (assuming such things exist). I snooped around on Amazon for a few hours but really have no idea what is a good or bad deal.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance.

Holy smokes guys, thanks a lot for all of the kind words and encouragement! I don't often post on reddits because nothing I had to say ever seemed to generate interest but I can see that you lot are different. I'm gonna go check out the local sporting goods store today hoping they have some plastic for me to look at and I plan on hitting the local course on Tuesday, that is of course after I finish this green leafy stuff I'm having for breakfast. I see you have a registry, so I'll go ahead and put my name down, if any of you find yourselves in a little town called Alpena, MI. Hit me up so you can embarrass me on the course, lol.

Just got home from the local store and I was pretty stoked to see that they actually had choices. I picked up a 3 pack with an Innova Aviar, Shark, and Leopard.

I'll compile this and let you know what you have chosen.

[First Update] (http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/vvu0q/update_official_reddit_disc_golf_disc/)

I am very pleased to announce that Millennium has accepted our offer and will be printing reddit discs for /r/discgolf. Here is the e-mail that I received:

We are just as excited to have these done as you are. This could be a very good thing for the both of us.

For the first stamping, we will start off with 100 discs. We will cover all the fees. The reddit discs will be available for purchase exclusively at www.discsunlimited.net . Here are the prices, Millennium Standard plastic is $10.50, Millennium Quantum and Sirius $15, and $2 for minis (if there is a demand for them).
 
Here is a list of the blank discs and weights we have available for stamping... You can pick up to 4 models to stamp. (You might have the reddit community do a vote on what 4 discs they would want)

Standard Plastic - $10.50

Astra (160-64, 65-69, 70-72, 73-75g)
 
JLS (160-64, 65-69, 70-72, 73-75g)

Scorpius (170-72, 73-75) NEW!
 
Sentinel MF (165-69g, 170-74g)
 
Give me an idea of what discs and weights you guy's would like us to have printed up and we can go from there.
 
Take care,
Alex

TL;DR - We are voting on the 4 discs we would like to have stamped. My guess is that they'll do 25 of each. Let the voting begin. 

HOW IT WILL WORK: Please vote for 2 discs. We will discuss weights after we have the discs picked out. I'd like to divide the discussion in half for simplicity sake. 

EDIT: I made the list easier to read.

A lot of you may remember me from my post a few days ago:
http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/1i9ot7/overweight_and_tired_of_it_want_to_try_disc_golf/

I hit one of the local courses tonight with a buddy and I have to say that despite the 90 degree temperature and not really knowing what I was doing I had an absolute blast!

It took us about an hour to do the 9 holes that make up that course, and by the end I was just drenched in sweat, but fortunately my feet and legs didn't hurt at all, my back however was screaming. (which is to be expected)

A few things I noticed this first time out:

-As a right handed thrower, all of my backhands curved left and the few forehands I tried curved right. (Hopefully that is typical)

-I am quite out of shape and by the 4th or 5th hole I had to really concentrate hard to keep what little form I had in check (Obviously I had never seen the course so we didn't keep score despite me parring the first hole)

-All of my shots seemed to gain a lot more altitude than I was expecting (probably just me being a noob)

-The 9th hole on that course is an abomination and ate my mid range (although my buddy that threw it agree'd to replace any discs he threw and lost before we went out, Good on him!)

Yeah so that's all that I can think of for now. Just wanted to reiterate that I had way more fun than I was expecting and can't wait to get out again!

Thanks for listening,

I did not remember where or exactly when I lost it but it had been over two or three years. Me and a few buddies were out playing at our local course last summer and let a couple guys play through us. One of the guys threw and his disc landed at my feet. MY DISC!!! Sure enough it was my Leopard. Name and number still on it. I picked it up and told the guy it was mine and I was taking it back. He threw a fit, almost boiled into a fist fight. Finally, I showed him my ID card, then I just walked away with my favorite disc. Anyways, have you ever encountered anything like this? Was I in the wrong. My friends thought so.

I've noticed a disturbing trend here and on a couple of other disc golf boards that I post on. it feels like a LOT of people expect to be able to walk out on a disc golf course, play once or twice and be great.
At the end of the day, DG is a sport (the funnest, best sport in the world, but a sport none the less.)

There is NO ""get good fast"" magic formula.
So, here's some tips.

1. Disc. the. fuck. down. You don't need a 13 speed driver when you are first starting out. This is a mistake that most people make. Get out there with a teebird or a midrange or a putter and get your form down. Look at the flight chart to see where you need to be throwing. http://gottagogottathrow.com/discgolf/pdf/JoesFlightChart1.pdf 

2. Slow is smooth. Smooth is long. So slow the fuck down.
3. Practice your putting. Now go do it again. And again. OK, now do it a lot more.
4. Go to the field by your house and just practice throwing. Stay off of the course sometimes. Just go practice your form.
5. Watch the Beato videos. Now go watch the climo and felberg videos. now go practice them.
Beato Vid - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nED7gcXobEo . Feldberg Towel Drill (amazing, amazing drill) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQzUrn80UI . Climo Putting Video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw0cKXKkC5E 

6. listen to the old guys (they know how to get better. they've seen it all. our course elders helped me with my game more than anyone else could have.)

if you don't give a shit about getting better, then cool. play with what you like and have a blast! there is a place for that, and I honestly envy people that can walk out on the course and not give a shit about their score and/or are not competitive. I really am. as it stands, I play for fun and to get better. I'll never play Open, or maybe even Am I, but I am always looking to get better. 

Vets, feel free to add or whatever. 
I hope this is beneficial for some of the new cats. I love seeing the sport grow! It's amazing that it's boomed so much in the time that I have been playing. 

Disc on!

1362548043.0,69,self.discgolf,19rd53,The wizardly method of marbling - an easy and artistic way to dye your discs!,,82,13,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/19rd53/the_wizardly_method_of_marbling_an_easy_and/,"**[Click here for pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/SwnPh#0)**

**Materials:**

* iDye Poly or RIT Pro (MUST be the Poly version; RIT should work as long as “ND” isn’t on it)

* Shaving cream (foamy and/or gel)

* Clear laundry detergent (or something similar)

* Dinner plate (ceramic, plastic, etc.)

* Stick (paintbrush, pencil, etc.)

* Squeeze bottle (whatever kind)

* Acetone (or non-acetone nail polish remover)

**[Click here for pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/SwnPh#0)** - in case you missed it :)

**Methods:**

1. Mix ~1oz water, ~1 teaspoon acetone, &gt;10oz detergent, and dye in a squeeze bottle.

2. Put foamy, gel, or mixed shaving cream on a plate that’s bigger than a disc.

3. Put a small amount of dye (droplets) on top of the shaving cream and make a design.

4. Place a disc onto the shaving cream, push down slightly to cover flight plate.

5. Leave it alone once it's down. Once ready, pull the disc up and rinse it off.

**[Click here for pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/SwnPh#0)** - in case you missed it :)

**Tips**

* Acetone will remove the stamp, be careful.

* All discs don’t dye the same. Not every plastic will take dye perfectly. And you can’t dye a darker color disc with a lighter color dye. Colors of discs and dyes will mix (blue dye on a yellow disc…). Go to DGCR for more info (see links below). See [this thread](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/forums/showthread.php?t=30082) for more info on which plastics take dye.

* You won’t know it without reading the package, but iDye Poly comes in a dissolving packet, so you can just toss the whole thing into water/liquid. The “color intensifier"" may give you problems for dip dyeing (according to bombmk). Maybe not for marbling, but I don't use it. 

* Laundry detergent is for thickness. Clear detergent doesn’t change your dye color.

* I used about 1-2oz of water with a little non-acetone nail polish remover (that’s all I had) I used a cleaned out dish soap squeeze bottle.

* Squirt shaving cream onto the plate and foam it up real nice. Make it even and thick. Don’t allow air pockets.

* Squeeze little bits of dye out at a time on top of the shaving cream. Then swirl around in a pattern you like. Or random. Whatevs. Don’t overdo it.

* Push disc down until the entire flight plate is covered. Be mindful of the fact that the dye nearest to the edge of the flight plate will push out and kind of smear the dye pattern. You could probably form your shaving cream to have a bit of a concave section to avoid this if you’re crafty like that. I don’t really care.

* Leave it alone as long as you want. See my ‘Cloud Storm’ - it was lifted after 5 hours. Tentacular was 24 hours.

* If you don’t like your first dye, you can deepen, add, mix, or change colors (you cannot lighten colors as far as I know)

**Background:**

I didn’t want to spend all the time necessary to cut out a cool design and deal with dyeing discs the traditional dip dye way because I don’t have anything I want to dye onto a disc. For reference, dip dyeing is what they call it when you cut some vinyl/contact paper (either by hand or machine), put it on the disc covering where you don’t want the dye to set in, and dye your disc in dye that has been heated to like 100 degrees or so.

I love the artistic dyes. The spin painting is my favorite, but I haven’t tried it. The setup is way more involved (modify a floor fan or use a turntable and dye/acetone mixture to paint on a disc as it spins). I don’t really care much about duplicating Jeff Ash’s Brainwave method either. Shaving cream marbling seemed simple enough for me! And it is. And it’s simple enough for you, too. The hardest part is waiting for your iDye Poly to come in the mail (or spending the time getting all the other necessary materials).

**[Click here for pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/SwnPh#0)** - in case you missed it :)

**Where to find iDye Poly:**

[Fabric.com](https://www.fabric.com/just-arrived-just-arrived-crafts-needlecrafts-jacquard-idye-poly-synthetic-fiber-fabric-dye.aspx)

That link won't be good forever. Just make sure that what you buy says iDye Poly, the Poly part is ESSENTIAL. It will not work if it's just iDye.

It's cheaper here but you have to order from the second group of iDye (for Polyester, NOT natural): [Dharma Trading](http://www.dharmatrading.com/iDye_for_Natural_and_Poly_Fabrics/index.shtml)

     I live in Portland, OR and was stoked to be informed about a brand spanking new 9-hole course just off of Glisan and 172nd behind the elementary school.  It is a perfect course for beginners or families and more advanced players as well. It has helped me improve my own game (3+ yrs throwing) immensely in a very short time.  It is a compact 9, with no drives over 350 but it is a well thought out course allowing for easy flow on busy days, as well as perfect for a few long bomb/safari holes on the quiet ones..
     So now to the point.  This course, like many across the united states, is right behind an elementary school, and smack dab in the middle of a relatively posh neighborhood.  The neighbors are not stuck up rich people (as I might have thought), most of them are very nice and curious about this sport that has taken over their park.  I have had the last two days off work,and spent them both there,  so I have had a chance to meet quite a few of them...Including their disc golfer children.  These boys (thankfully) warned me before I made a crucial mistake.  They informed me that the neighborhood watch will not hesitate to call the police on any illicit behavior seen going on in that park, AT ANY TIME, children present or not.  
     I spread this warning to all of my fellow ent-aholic, disc chukkers:  Please be respectful of the neighborhoods that surround these courses and the people who live there. Just be aware that they are protecting their children from that type of behavior.  By flaunting our habits (if I sound accusatory, I stand guilty beside you) and creating a perception that disc golfers are beer swilling-drug addicts, we do a dis-service to the sport of disc golf and maintain the negative stereotype that I often encounter when I tell people I play with frisbees by myself in the park.
     It is easy to understand where the stereotype comes from and all I am asking is the we all take an effort in the coming summer, on our own home courses and abroad, to promote the positive aspects of our beloved sport.  Please don't litter, not just out of respect for the neighbors but your fellow golfers, keep an old altoids tin on hand for cig butts and pack out your trash.  If you indulge in illicit behavior, be aware that others may not share or respect your life choices, in other words...""If you come between a mother bear and her cub, you're gonna have a bad time"". And as far as noise goes, I have no idea how loud (or long) I will scream and cry (like a little girl) when I hit my first ace, but I think everything will be okay if I keep the profanity to a minimum.
     Disc Golf is a great sport for all ages and walks of life, anyone can do it and have fun. It brings families together and gives fathers another opportunity to be a positive role model for their children.  I for one would love to see more parks like this within closer proximity to where I live, but I don't think that will happen if we create a negative impression on society as a whole.  Somebody spent quite a bit of money and a whole lot of time and care installing this course, and the same can be said for the course you cherish.  I contributed nothing, but have grown an immediate fondness for it.  The least I can do is respect the neighborhood and those kind enough to share it with me, all I ask is that you to do the same.
     That is my soapbox, and I appreciate your time, minds, and discs.
Happy throwing!

At one of the holes, standard OBs were followed, but if your disc went down into the ditch, you were required to wait till the end of the round to reclaim/search for it. On my throw, the spotter showed me where it went, and warned me that if I went down I would be disqualified.  Sadly it was in plain view, about a 15 second trip. Not wanting to be DQd I waited till the round ended to go back, but when I got there everything was gone. I asked some of the tourney directors if they had any discs recovered and they said no. With the course only being open to tournament players that day, it is kinda shitty to have a disc stolen by someone who is ""one of us.""

I have seen the heated debate and conversations about ""is it right to write on a basket after an Ace?""  As you would think from my topic title:  NO. PLEASE DO NOT WRITE ON THE BASKET.  I understand you are stoked you made an Ace, but honestly no one will ever know/care who ""CoolGuy357 ACED 09/07/12"" is. Take a picture, sign your disc, post to FB/Twitter, and don't vandalize the basket. 

My only exception? If you OWN the basket or you are playing on a private course where the owner let's you write on it.

As noted, we are happy you made the Ace.. great shot, but don't deface the public property. It makes the course look sub-standard, convey's a tainted image to non-players, it takes time/money/maintenance to clean up, and all the people who worked hard to get the baskets installed don't want you writing on them.  We all love great baskets and we all love Aces... let's not muddle the two.

Additionally, to all those folks putting stickers, adverts, and trash on baskets.. same rules apply; we get tired of cleaning the stuff off of the courses.

Here's what works for me.,leadwateocean,71,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/19f40u/feeling_stagnant_want_to_improve_your_game_heres/,"So I've been playing a little over a year, and I've been in love with the game since day 1. I live in an area where, although it is cold... I can play year round. I decided to dedicate this winter to dramatically improving my game, and until about a month ago my progress has been slower than I hoped.

For me, consistency had been my biggest hurdle. My rounds ranged from -3 to +4 from day to day on the same course. I also work a shitty schedule and am unable to dedicate a lot of time to repitition... so while out playing one morning by myself at the butt crack of dawn... I had an idea that I'm sure others here have had, but never the less I feel the need to share. 

We originally called it ""Double Disc"" ... but it was quickly renamed ""Devil's Disc"" because oh my god - it will piss you off. But its helped.

The rules are simple - Throw two discs on every throw, and play your worst. 

Two drives, two approaches, and most importantly you must make two putts to hole out. It means you must make 6 good throws to make par, but only 1 bad and you've got bogey or worse. 

Things its done for me:

- I've slowed down. Every shot is much more important if I am going to score well.

- I play for par and take the safest shot possible every time. 

- it has COMPLETELY removed good luck from my game, and forces me to learn to deal with the bad.

- I have new scores to beat on the same courses I have been playing this whole time, and beating those scores has more to do with skill and less to so with how lucky I was on my round. 

- Its helped me learn to throw more than one mold on every shot (I don't have 2 of any mold in my bag).

Give it a shot! It does suck when you park your first drive for what would be an easy bird, but shank your 2nd drive, leave an approach shot out of range, and your 2nd putt rolls away and you're left with a 5 or 6 on your card... and your first shot set you up for an easy 2... but having to deal with those situations more often has helped me learn to play smarter, take fewer throw it and hope shots, and take the bad stuff in stride.

Apologies for spelling/grammar.. typed this on my phone during my lunch break.


TL;DR - throw twice, play your worst.",,False,self,t5_2qk68,1362089790.0,,,True,t3_19f40u,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/19f40u/feeling_stagnant_want_to_improve_your_game_heres/,

I was advised to contact a number of different disc manufacturers who might possibly be able to give away some of their misprinted discs for little or no charge. I did as I was advised, and after around 2 weeks of waiting, I received a response!

I got an email from Millenium Golf Discs saying that... well, it wasn't very long, so I'll just paste it here:

*''We received your letter and it sounds like you operate a great facility.  We would be able to spare a handful of misprinted discs, but would require you to cover the shipping costs, which could vary around the $30-$35 range (USD).  Let us know if you would be willing to do this and we can see about a more accurate estimate on shipping and how many discs we can send.''*

Thankfully we can afford to pay the shipping and are extremely grateful to Millenium Discs for their very kind offer. But, without you very kind redditors we wouldn't have asked them at all, so all of this rambling is a way of saying thank you to you all too!

1363902316.0,65,self.discgolf,1arcg2,The Unwritten Rules of Disc Golf...,WesStrikesBack,98,33,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/1arcg2/the_unwritten_rules_of_disc_golf/,"Here's my first hyzer bomb attempt:

(please add or edit for a cool document for n00bs!)

These are localized rules of Northern Santa Barbara Disc Golf.  I also find it an interesting cultural exercise to see what unwritten rules exist in other locales.  So bring it!

1)  Clean the course as you play and never litter.  Our club is buying new trash cans and drinking fountains for the whole park and they will be labeled as gifts from the DG'ers.

2)  Never vandalize or abuse the chains, baskets or do any landscaping (cutting trees, bushes, etc.)

3)  Keep park patrons happy.  Don't throw into them or cajole them.  Be gentle until they've been in your line for longer than a minute after noticing you, then shout 'nicely' to encourage them.  We usualyl send an ambassador to explain what we're doing.  Most folks have no idea how sharp, heavy or long dg discs are.

4)  Euro attitude towards intoxicants:  all about low profile and attitude.  If you're tripping balls on 1000 mics of liquid LSD, I could care less.  You can throw discs on smack as far as I'm concerned, I should never be able to tell that you are high or buzzed.  Period.  There is a place at nearly every park (or your car) that you can take some low pro bellows and get back on the course quickly.  My rule:  never let any non-DG'er smell my exhalations.  I keep beer on the DL, invisible, and recycle all my empties!

5) Keep your park safe.  Our club talked so much shit to a local suspected child molester who parked for hours a day, he never shows his face at the park any more.  Children are safe at that park again, and that's the way we should all be.  Sherrifs of our own courses.

6)  Always hand putters back to their owners when clearing your own disc from the basket.  Ask before picking up a disc not resting in the basket.

7)  Call every single number you find on a lost disc.  If you don't, you might as well be a basket thief.

8)  Help your bros and sistahs find their discs when they are lost.  It looks really douchey when three people are looking for a disc and you're practicing your mid range game.

9)  Encourage your female friends to pick up the game.  Remind them that disc golf is like  a convertible Ferrari:  any woman looks twice as hot in context.

10)  Play ready disc golf (except for tourneys), don't make players wait for you to talk or text.  The disc is not the conch dude, STFU and throw!

11)  Pay attention to where others in your group are, and don't stand in between them or the basket.  Allow players to putt without seeing you anywhere near or behind the basket.

12)  A putt that rolls back to your feet gets a redo, unless in tourney or with uptight handicappers.

13)  A rolling hillside Death Putt should be kicked and stopped if it rolls at another player in non-tourney play.  I make sure I kick it no nearer than 20', so they have a challenge coming back.

14)  If a player can retrieve a disc from a tree without climbing or using a tool, I give them no penalty.  Above 2 meters in tourney play is a penalty stroke.

15)  Wave faster groups through and wave them up when everyone is clear.

16)  Mob play (groups of 6+) only make sense if the park is pretty empty.  Let folks play through always!

17)  Encourage young people and newbs to greatness and offer to play with them to teach them some throws.  I keep old, unwanted discs to give to kids that i see showing interest at the course.

I'm making shit up now, so I'll stop.  Enjoy!",,False,self,t5_2qk68,1363906340.0,,,True,t3_1arcg2,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/1arcg2/the_unwritten_rules_of_disc_golf/,

As I was grabbing my bag from my car and changing my shoes, another solo disc’er walked by and asked “You playing by yourself? Want to play through together?” To which I replied “sure, sounds fun.”

We threw the course together. He was considerably better than me so I took this opportunity to ask any and all questions I had concerning form, technique, disc selection and such. By the end of the round of 18 he said “I noticed some of your discs were hyzering down too hard for you, probably because they’re too high of speed, follow me to my car.”

He continued to open up his trunk, filled with at least 100 discs. He searched through them and gave me no less than 4 discs. A Star Leopard, A DX Stingray, A Champion eagle, and a DX(?) Roc. 

He also told me a story about how he used to throw Buzzz’s, but a friend of his had a Roc lying around and said to him “If I gave you a Roc, would you throw it?” So I was completely taken aback when he was rummaging through his trunk and said to me “If I gave you a Roc, would you throw it?”

So I walked away from the course with 4 new (well, new to me) discs in my bag. All thanks to this great guy I met on the course. We exchanged numbers and have plans to meet up again for another round. 

I don’t know how he feels about me putting his name online, but for now let me just say “Thank you ‘A’” I cannot believe the kindness of some people, and I hope to be able to repay the favor someday. 

I plan to hold onto the all the discs, but especially the Roc. I hope one day to pay it forward and find another disc golfer on a course in need of a good disc and ask them the same question that he asked me – “If I gave you a Roc, would you throw it?”",,False,self,t5_2qk68,False,,,True,t3_13hkdb,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/13hkdb/just_wanted_to_share_my_great_experience_on_the/,

We hope you enjoy the updates and we encourage feedback on anything that might help the community.

First I must say, I have been consistently amazed by the community's growth over the past year -- we literally doubled in size (and traffic) in just the past couple months! Some days I can't even keep up with the impressive amount of fresh content, but luckily we have so many amazing members that carry the load of posts and comments each and every day that there never seems to be a lacking discussion. These are the people who really deserve the credit for making our community what it is today -- so thank YOU!

The biggest change is the creation of several niche discgolf subs, and an official FAQ page. Over time we have noticed that many posts fall into one of several categories, and with all the current growth it makes sense to take advantage of these mostly-separate subtopics which are loosely defined in the newly updated sidebar. A quick look at our recent post history and you can see that there is plenty of content for these subs without detracting from the main sub. 

Also, with a flood of new users, it is only natural that we will occasionally see similar posts and questions. While we welcome any and all posts, the creation of a FAQ will ease the burden on users who consistently spend their time answering the same questions, or digging up old posts, while also providing a better centralized repository of common knowledge for the community. The FAQ page contains definitions, techniques, and advice, as well as links to posts, videos, and other reference materials.

We are also introducing a variety of CSS related tweaks. The most important is the top subreddit bar which provides the same links within all of our community subs for easy navigation. (The FAQ will be moved to the official FAQ page soon.) We can also employ sidebar pics, username tags, and a plethora of other tweaks for visual aides -- more on this to come, as we are looking for more feedback from all of you.

I really want to say thank you again to all the hard working members of our community that have helped discuss and develop the changes you see -- I couldn't have done it myself, and I surely don't deserve the credit as if I did! I need to especially thank our new moderator Weatherstation for leading this charge on updating r/discgolf. I have been quite distracted from Reddit lately, and Weatherstation is always there motivating me to stay with it and keep active. As a personal friend, he has kept me up to date with the community when I am too busy to do so (while out discing of course!), and his constant efforts deserve the recognition.

1366695008.0,66,self.discgolf,1cx3f7,Robinson Cano teaches proper disc golf form,WithoutAComma,78,12,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/1cx3f7/robinson_cano_teaches_proper_disc_golf_form/,"I'm sure many people here don't give a damn about baseball, but I thought this might be fun and interesting anyway as I feel it relates pretty well to discgolf form.

I had a conversation with /u/spoonraker on a thread here the other day about the importance of pivoting on the heel of the front foot rather than the ball, and how awkward and counter-intuitive I personally feel it's been to transition to this method. If you want to read that exchange, [here you go](http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/1cr0nf/dave_feldberg_2013_video_tip_1/c9jgl4b). 

This conversation was in the back of my mind today when I saw Robinson Cano of the Yankees hit a homerun in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays. The broadcasters commented on his smooth weight transfer, and how that transferred power into his swing, which made me think immediately about disc golf. So I watched the slow-motion very carefully, and took some screencaps.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/LkZCw#0) is the slideshow from the beginning. The most important one though is [here](http://imgur.com/a/LkZCw#2), at the moment of contact. When he is making contact with the ball, it looks like his weight shift is 90/10 front foot/back foot. And on his front foot, it's pretty clear that he is pivoting on the outside of his heel. His [finish](http://imgur.com/a/LkZCw#4) is actually fairly balanced front to back.

For me, the takeaway here is how much power you can actually put behind your throw using this method. While it might feel or seem intuitive to get all of your weight and rotation centered on a point as far forward as possible, in reality you are wasting a lot of your momentum and the power that comes from your core by falling forward through your throwing motion. You would never see a great power hitter fall forward on his big swings, and I'd guess that it would be difficult to get full power behind your throw if you do the same throwing a disc. 

Of course, it's more evident/natural in baseball because you hold onto your bat through your backswing, the weight and momentum of which helps to naturally pull your weight backward in the follow-through. But that doesn't necessarily make the method less important or effective.

And by the way, [he hit the ball a long ways](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=429664#gameType=%27R%27) (click on the solo homer video link).

1366674702.0,66,self.discgolf,1cwdzh,"How would you feel about an indoor disc golf ""putt-putt"" course?",jacetheace517,73,7,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/1cwdzh/how_would_you_feel_about_an_indoor_disc_golf/,"I'm thinking of something similar to a mini-golf course with short approach shots and putting. Probably nothing over 100-150 ft total distance. But put obstacles to navigate and/or putt around. There could even be water hazards, but since its indoors it is more feasible to have a mobile net to retrieve sunken discs out of.

Ideally this place would also be able to sell at least one brand of disc and have snacks and drinks as well.

So my questions to you is this: 

1) Would something like this in your town be attractive to you?

2) If yes to 1, would you be willing to bring new players to a place like this to get the feel for the game?

3) If yes to 1, how much would something like this be worth to you in terms of money? I know most of us like free courses but would you be willing to pay say, 5 bucks to get an all day pass to this ""Disc Golf Zone""?

4) Would you use this place during ""peak times"" for typical disc golf (ie. daytime, not raining/snowing/etc) or only during times where a normal course is not pleasant to play?",,False,self,t5_2qk68,False,,,True,t3_1cwdzh,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/1cwdzh/how_would_you_feel_about_an_indoor_disc_golf/,
