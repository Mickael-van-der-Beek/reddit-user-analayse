Dear Bitcoiners, Mt Gox customers, and Redditors.
The past few days and weeks have been a rollercoaster ride to say the least, and while we are still under constant DDos attack (more so than usual) we wanted to take the time to do an AMA on Reddit and communicate directly with everyone. Mark Karpeles, President and CEO of Mt.Gox will reply to any questions you may have regarding the recent events. 

Of course this ranges from the recent DDoS attacks, the overwhelming amount of new accounts created in the past few months (and days for that matter), and of course everything you ever wanted to know about Mt.Gox. 

Some technical details we cannot divulge since they will assist those trying to undermine the exchange, but we will do our best to answer your questions over the next couple of hours.

Verification: https://www.facebook.com/MtGox/posts/443093862439476

UPDATE: Thanks so much to everyone for your questions, criticisms, and comments. We hope we were able to clarify enough, at least for now. This was an interesting few hours! If you think this was helpful, and you want us to do more in the future, we are open to it. The beauty of bitcoin is openness and transparency and we aspire to that as much as possible. Speaking of which, we haven't forgotten about publishing our transparency report either, but that was postponed for obvious reasons. Please give us a couple of weeks. 

Thanks again. Back to work for us.

I'm a computer security and distributed systems guy. I've did audits and trainings at many large banks and lotteries and also built complicated stuff like a quantum cryptography engine and a p2p file sync engine. I also worked at TradeHill for 3 months in 2011. You can learn more about me here http://paulbohm.com/about/

You may also know me from a Bitcoin article I wrote two years ago that's popular on Quora: http://www.quora.com/Bitcoin/Is-the-cryptocurrency-Bitcoin-a-good-idea 

I'm really annoyed at the exchange software quality and yesterday spontaneously tweeted that I'd start working on an open-source high-performance highly-secure exchange engine and asked if anyone wants to join me in my San Francisco apartment.

Seven people showed up, including a Stanford professor, someone who built an ISP, someone who previously built a payment system and an angel investor. They all were tremendous help in nailing down the core architecture. Later today another friend will come by who is an expert in B-tree filesystem design, which will help with getting the data structures right.

I'm doing some explorative coding at http://github.com/buttercoin/buttercoin and note-taking at http://buttercoin.hackpad.com/ but it's really just a rough outline right now.

Basically I want to build something similar to the LMAX architecture (http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html), in node.js and put it under an MIT license. If this worked it should allow us to process enormous amounts of transaction, or even do things that help distribute exchange more.

Let me know if any of you are interested in joining a hipchat or hackpad and discussing the design, or contributing on github.

I can't promise this will succeed - before yesterday I had no plans or ambition to write an exchange, but I really want Bitcoin to succeed and I don't think it can without a quality opensource exchange package.

You can email me at enki@bbq.io or if you want to motivate me send donations to 1McqPj92jvWfFg5F24dwyDSUptjTosH2EY (i will donate any funds received to the bitcoin foundation should I not succeed at building buttercoin).

Any thoughts? I'd love to hear it!

David Marcus, president of EBay Inc.'s PayPal unit was on Bloomberg today where he said:

&gt; And I think here, for us at PayPapl, it's just a question of whether Bitcoin will make its way to PayPal's funding instrument or not, and we're kind of thinking about it right now.

Here are the links to [the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1d078f/paypal_sees_20_billion_in_mobile_transactions/) and to [the video](http://www.bloomberg.com/video/paypal-sees-20-billion-in-mobile-transactions-WlokACTBRterdjHAJGNB6w.html).

**[Update:]**

A lot of people are really missing the *big picture* here! If PayPal accepts Bitcoin as a funding instrument, it will open up the flood gates for spending Bitcoin and it will have numerous other benefits:

* **You will be able to spend your bitcoins on eBay!!!**
* **People from all those countries currently not supported by PayPal can now fund their PayPal accounts with Bitcoin!**
* PayPal provides consumer protection!
* Merchants will get Bitcoin payment processing directly from PayPal!
* They may even be a sort of ""proxy exchange"" where the average Joe can buy Bitcoins with money from their credit card or bank account.

Talk about groundbreaking!!!

I will track its progress here over time.,anon_bitcoin_gambler,1251,278,1507,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/18f3pd/i_have_my_entire_retirement_and_savings_invested/,"I created this throwaway because I wanted to share what I've done, and someday look back on this thread in either regret or triumph.    

I am not a wealthy man.  I am actually quite poor and have a lot of student loan debt.  But I have good credit.  I have applied for, and received over $30,000 USD in credit card 0% balance transfer cash, which I have slowly been investing in bitcoin for the past two months.  I started when it was $14/BTC.  At this second, it is $25.10/BTC.  I have invested some of it in satoshidice, and the rest will be stored in an offline wallet.

I may someday regret this decision.  It represents the exact amount of my entire retirement and savings accounts.  If bitcoin ever becomes worthless, well, I will just have to deal with it and find another way to retire.  If bitcoin takes off the way I think it will, I will someday be a wealthy man and my family will be set.  

I am not doing this out of greed, but to support my family and hopefully never have to worry about money again... something I've stressed about for decades.  I realize it's controversial and some may take a dim view of it (my family included).  But what's done is done.

I am not going to post again until a year from now.  And then I will post each year following.  Wish me luck.

EDIT:  Thank you all for the feedback.  I expected some opposition and advice.  I have received more than enough, including some things I had not thought of.  Most of it I anticipated and already considered though.  I am done posting, and hopefully have clarified my position.  I will be back in 1 year to document what happened.  Have a good day.

UPDATE 4/9/13:  I won't give a full accounting until after a year, but I have said that if it goes above 200 and stays there for at least a week, I am going to quit my job.  This morning it crossed $200/BTC.  Next week I will be quitting my job if it hasn't gone below $200.  I have a few Avalon ASIC miners on the way that will hopefully help me preserve this wealth, or at least pay my debts back and enjoy some time off from work for a while... or forever.

UPDATE 4/10/13:  All:  I cashed out $30,000 USD worth the past few days.  I plan on repaying the credit card debts in their entirety next week.  I sold at 195, 212, and 242 price points.  It was just getting too stressful watching all the recent gains and corrections.  I will have a little seller's remorse as the price continues to go up, but I also feel relieved that all the coins I have at this point are icing on the cake.  Plus, I am hopeful that my incoming Avalons will generate a lot more down the line.  More later.

To the asshole trying to crack my password and access my tip funds:  16 character lastpass randomly generated, non-pronounecable, minimum 8 digits with special characters.  Good luck with that.  

UPDATE 4/11/13:  A few have suggested that I have played a role in the recent correction with my decision to cash out my initial investment.  I highly doubt that, and you are all smart enough to make your own decisions.  Nevertheless, I am going to take a break from commenting for a while.  It's just been too crazy.  I will be back when things stabilize, at whatever price that is.

UPDATE 5/15/13:  What a month.  I took the plunge and quit my job a few weeks ago.  Last day is Friday.  I was told by my supervisor I could ""come back anytime,"" so I am not too worried if the Bitcoin thing doesn't work out.  Anyway, I have an ASICMiner blade arriving any day now.  I have several Avalons arriving in the near future as well.  I am confident they will pay for far more than my salary ever did.  But just in case, I cashed out about 100 coins when the price was $76 a few weeks back.  Talk about a panic sell!  I didn't post the update here in the off chance it would influence the market as some of you speculated.  That should get me through the next few months until all the ASICs arrive and start hashing.  After that, who knows.  I have a new lease on life right now, and have been exercising and spending tons of time with my kids the past few days as I wound down time at my job.

Recently, I have also pondered starting a non-profit food bank or other charity like sean's outpost.  That would be my dream:  to help others after I have paid my debts down.  We will see.  I'd provide a full accounting, but most of you would laugh because about 70% of it is tied up in ASIC miners right now.  As my name implies, I guess I am still a gambler at heart.  Thanks for the pms and kind words everyone.

UPDATE: 5/22/13:  Pic of my new 13,000 mH/s baby. :D

http://imgur.com/FAbVfPJ  

**UPDATE 8/14/13:  Not much to really say, but I'm still here.  I am a little annoyed with the skyrocketing difficulty though.  Right now I'm mining with about 470-480Gh/s of equipment on BTC Guild under the team name ""Fecal Antimatter.""  I don't think the ASICs will ever pay for themselves, so that was probably a bad investment.  I occasionally hang out in the just-dice chat room and invest there if any of you ever want to chat.  With the exception of the climbing exchange rate right now, there honestly hasn't been much good news to talk about.  To be honest, mining and the IPO craze going on right now has soured my views on things.  I am a stay-at-home dad now and loving every minute of it.  I am not going to sell my coins, but am definitely not going to take as many risks as I used to.  Thanks for all the kind PMs, and even the hate mail.  It's all good fun.**

1369819319.0,853,self.Bitcoin,1f9ck4,PayPal shut my account down for giving away free bitcoins with purchases.,NikolaiRimskyK,1062,209,172,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1f9ck4/paypal_shut_my_account_down_for_giving_away_free/,"This is just a heads up to those using PayPal to either sell bitcoins, or those using BitPay/Coinbase in conjunction with PayPal.

**TLDR: I started a website in April to sell products for bitcoins. I offered to give bitcoins to customers purchasing via PayPal. This violated PayPal's Terms. They gave me two days to stop, requiring affidavit to be notarized. No notaries were available, as these two days were on the weekend. By Monday, they just decided to end my service. If you're using PayPal and Bitcoin as payment methods, you may be okay, but be careful how you market. Learn from my mistake(s).**

 started selling brand name and budget electronics for bitcoins in April. I decided to give my customers an option to pay with PayPal or BitPay. If they paid with PayPal, I'd give anywhere from 0.001 BTC to 0.50 BTC to them for free, depending on the item. It usually worked out to a 10% rebate. If they paid with bitcoins, I'd give free shipping and 10% off the sale price of the products. 

Things were going great until PayPal somehow found out. I was asked not to continue that incentive marketing model, which I agreed to. I got an email on a Saturday, requesting a signed and notarized affidavit, and by Monday, before I could even provide the info, they just decided to hell with me. They told me they didn't want to deal with a site that was selling using bitcoins. Blew my mind.

I've checked out a couple payment providers available to Canadian business and one wouldn't allow me to sell products for bitcoins on the same domain as non-btc purchases that they would be used for.

So, I've switched to a bitcoin sales model only, using BitPay and Coinbase and I'm continuing the free shipping.

**Edit:** Because my inbox is exploding with people asking for the web address, it is [btcfever.com](http://btcfever.com). I honestly didn't expect such response from my inane ramblings over the foul taste that PayPal has left with me.

I've decided, for at least the time being, that I will only be only accepting payment via BitPay and Coinbase.

To be fair, I had made a blacklist of users that had made purchases via PayPal, received the ""free bitcoins"" and then filed an unauthorized dispute via PayPal (thankfully, prior to me shipping the goods), but the bitcoins were lost. I hadn't published the list, as I wrote it in anger, and as an old friend of mine always said, never send an email (publish a page) when you're angry. Wait until you've had time to cool down and re-read it. I had marked the page as hidden on my Big Commerce site, unaware that it was actually published. (A Reddit user brought it up here). I have since removed the page all together, as I did refer to an individual as ""an idiot that costs us money."" Chances are, this was the claim that caused PayPal to investigate my account.

In their eyes (and probably the government's too), I was operating a Money Services Business. I was neither licensed nor registered to operate as such, which may be the inaccurate information that was included as one of the reasons why my account was closed.

My primary goal is to delivery brand name and budget electronics and gadgets for bitcoins at reasonable and competitive prices. My attempts at giving away bitcoins with each purchase was to spread the word about bitcoins. I want to get more people interested in using the currency, which will benefit the entire bitcoin community.

**Edit 2**: PayPal just called me with some information that may be of interest. 

They have informed me that due to the recently high number of transactions involving bitcoins, usually for sale via eBay (which allow the sale of bitcoins at the present time, as long as they are listed in either a classified format or in the category Everything Else/Other), or via other websites - PayPal on the other hand will not allow people to sell, or transfer any amount of bitcoins in relation to a sale via their service. 

This is due to numerous chargebacks by users buying bitcoins, then claiming unauthorized payment, or other such disputes. This is risk management on their part and I completely understand it. They were very polite and knowledgeable, and I think this clears up some of the ambiguity as to why PayPal isn't dealing with businesses that are doing transactions involved with bitcoins (giving away bitcoins with a purchase like I was doing led to at least once instance of a customer receiving the bitcoins and filing a dispute). 

I'm not sure if PayPal is against bitcoins, as recent talks from PayPal representatives have seemed to be positive (with possible future implementation of the bitcoin currency added to their service). But that's just imho.

There is still no word on whether I will be allowed to do business with them in the future, but frankly, I'm not interested. I'm sticking with a bitcoin sales only model. There is less risk to me for chargebacks and I have more control over issuing refunds to ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty. I believe the very nature of the bitcoin transaction reduces fraud and protects sellers far more than other methods.

Buyers however need to be assured that once they send their bitcoins to a website (especially a new website like mine), that they will receive their product and not lose their bitcoins. So if you are interested in spending bitcoins and you are not sure whether you can trust a website (it's very easy to make an e-commerce site and add a bunch of products), either don't make the purchase if you're not comfortable, search for reviews of the site, or find a site that has been well established. Yes, I may be talking myself out of some sales, but I believe that it is now up to sellers to ensure the integrity of the bitcoin community.",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,1369857887.0,,,True,t3_1f9ck4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1f9ck4/paypal_shut_my_account_down_for_giving_away_free/,

We've been here before. 
Many times in fact.  Peer through our history and you'll see that the [value of a bitcoin has fluctuated many times in the past.](http://i.imgur.com/E0jriM7.jpg)  And that's okay.  

By design, Bitcoins are meant to be scarce. The hard limit of 21 million and controlled process of minting makes it so that [we can predict inflation over time.](http://www.mattwhitlock.com/Bitcoin%20Inflation.png)  This means the bitcoin won't be diluted by a central authority printing more of them.  To a great extent, their worth is driven entirely by demand.

What caused this most recent price rise?  A variety of positive factors:

* The block reward halving last December from 50 to 25 made bitcoin supply all the more scarce.  

* Demand could now comfortably outpace supply, the price grew.

* Companies became heavily delayed in the development ASIC products, thus far unable to release them en-mass.  Bitcoin's largest market of miners invested directly in the currency rather than machinery.

* Companies involved with bitcoin began [posting positive profits](http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/01/bitcoin-based-casino-rakes-in-over-500000-profit-in-six-months/) early in the year. Bitcoin caught on with merchants &amp; investors alike.

* Bitcoins became accepted as a form of payment by [many companies,](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade) further increasing their utility and value.

* FinCen regulations were seen as the first step towards legitimacy, International events such as Cyprus were heavily reported in the media, and contributed to an atmosphere of distrust in fiat.  

Most importantly though, Bitcoin once again got caught up in a cycle that any scarce commodity can experience.  The scarcity means we're actually prone to experience rapid spikes in value, much the the same way that inflation can rapidly devalue a currency.  

But it's a cycle that can't continue indefinitely, and that's okay. We're in a free market system, for all the good and bad that comes with it these are expansions and contractions that must occur as bitcoin moves forward.  The 21 million cap means that BTC is designed to be a very high valued currency someday.  If a mere 1% of the world's GDP were poured into it, (690 billion) then each bitcoin would be worth roughly $32,000.  But I can't stress this enough: **this is only the 2nd reward era, 3600 BTC are still being made each day, and it will be a long time before scarcity can sustain those high values.** 

What's going to happen now is that the market will search for an equilibrium value between the amount of BTC mined each day and the demand for it.  Bitcoin is absolutely prone to overshoot this value, and then come back down in a correction.  Given that demand (and confidence) in bitcoin is constantly changing, this is difficult to predict.  What I can tell you is that which each new block halving every 4 years, bitcoin will become more and more scarce, further sustaining its ability to hold value.  

This is not the worst correction we've ever endured either.   June 2011 saw the peak of a 33-fold rise in value, followed by a 16-fold drop in the following months.  Confidence will wane and wax.  Demand will rise and fall, but bitcoin will endure.  I have full trust in the blockchain itself as a stable entity. It's the 3rd party services built around bitcoin that sometimes falter.  We're still stumbling around in the early days as the kinks are worked out and this vehicle is built into a massively capable and useful technology.  [The innovations to improve security, escrow, and trust](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4L7xDNCmA&amp;list=WLB84DFF3E3B6A009E) will come all in due time.  And you may participate in any way you wish.  

What is Bitcoin?  It's an experiment, an idea, and a passion of many.  
Don't make it out to be something its not.  It is not a get rich quick scheme.  It is potentially an investment but also a risky one.  Advice is abound in this subreddit but remember that no one can perfectly predict the future, and know that you are always free to make decisions as you see fit.  Be safe, be smart, and myself and other helpful members of this forum will always be around to assist in any way we can.

I can definitely see Bitcoin establishing itself as a major world currency, and basically doing to fiat currencies what email did to the postal system.

However, whenever I mention Bitcoin to anyone, I **strongly** encourage them not to invest more than they are prepared to lose. I myself only own 10 BTC. Why? Because Bitcoin has flaws, and it has potential enemies, and I think there's a very good chance that the currency could be basically destroyed overnight.

*THE PROBLEMS:*

1. **The code.** Bitcoin is not a magic black box. It's a complicated piece of open-source software, written by a community of volunteers and hobbyists with various degrees of ability. IT CONTAINS BUGS. What these bugs are and how serious their symptoms will be remains to be seen, but we have already had a few serious problems (such as [the 0.7/0.8 fork](http://it.slashdot.org/story/13/03/12/063246/bitcoin-blockchain-forked-by-backward-compatibility-issue)) and it's likely there will be more to come.

2. **The value of exploits.** With the soaring value of Bitcoins, it is likely that it will increasingly become a target for attack. If someone can find and exploit a flaw, they can make a fortune. Due to the nature of Bitcoin, it would be almost impossible to discover the culprit or recover any losses. [This was already happening when there was almost nothing to gain from it!](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0)

3. **Government intervention.** Currency manipulation is one of the core economic controls of government. Mass adoption of Bitcoin would render this tool ineffective, or even unusable. It's certainly conceivable that the US or EU could implement a blanket ban on Bitcoin trades, which would utterly cripple the currency's expansion. As we're now hitting the point where large-scale funds are buying into Bitcoin, such a move would cause a rapid exodus of significant funds, by a few small high-worth individuals over a very short timescale. This, combined with the effect of legislation, would almost inevitably trigger a large-scale panic sell-off, and there would be no market remaining to allow for the currency's revival.

4. **Corporate sabotage.** Moneygram, Western Union, Paypal. Just three examples of multi-billion dollar multinationals with business models which would be rendered obsolete should Bitcoin achieve widespread adoption. Bitcoin, despite its rapid expansion and long-term potential, is tiny compared to many large organisations which have a vested interest in seeing the currency fail. At its current size, the Bitcoin economy could be toppled for a handful of million dollars- enough to buy and sell large volumes specifically to cause huge price swings, to undermine confidence with smear campaigns, or to directly attack flaws in the software or the network that underpins it.

5. **Fundamental flaws.** The design of Bitcoin is not perfect. We're already seeing the blockchain becoming bloated by the micro-transactions of SatoshiDice. What if the volume of these were to rise a thousandfold, through deliberate flooding or simply through the natural expansion of the currency? We're already worried about mining guilds which have control of too much computing power. 51% is quoted as the minimum level required in order to subvert the Bitcoin transaction system successfully. This is not strictly true- 51% is simply the point at which an attack becomes more likely to succeed than to fail. It's perfectly possible that an entity with a significant non-majority of mining power could succeed in poisoning the blockchain with dishonest blocks. This can be attempted over and over again by a motivated group or individual, and it only needs to succeed once to cause irreparable damage to Bitcoin's credibility.

With the current public interest in the currency, the media spotlight focused on it, and the fledgling involvement of high-value investors likely to abandon Bitcoin forcefully if they foresee any potential losses, I believe that Bitcoin is extremely vulnerable at present. Any one of the problems listed could trigger a panic which would crash the currency overnight, and in a way that it wouldn't likely recover from.

So, whilst I'm not concerned about the effects of speculative bubbles, and I do believe Bitcoin is destined for long-term success, I urge caution. Please, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,False,,,True,t3_1bxrrw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bxrrw/playing_devils_advocate_why_bitcoin_will_crash_to/,

I’d like to share what I have learned as it applies to Bitcoins, for the new Bitcoin thousandaires.
1)	Do not spend more than you can afford to lose! For a good guide, imagine planning for a weekend in Vegas or a day at the track or a poker outing. What is the most that you would want to gamble? If you spent more than twice that much on Bitcoins, you may want to rethink your strategy.
2)	Have an exit strategy, a backup exit strategy, and test them out. Most people think this is a bubble, but I can tell you that if there isn’t a burst, there will be a correction. And the higher and faster things rise, the harder they fall. Once a correction is triggered, people will panic, and trading sites will be overloaded and even crash. trading sites may even go bankrupt. New accounts can be slow to be approved or delayed indefinitely. This is why you should have at least 2 trading accounts made, and linked to a bank account. And test them, do a small trade. Imagine having 2000 Bitcoins, and it reaches $500. Then it starts falling, so you want to cash out at least half because you want to buy a house. It’s at 400, so you decide to sell. You register for a trading account. That takes a few hours to be approved. It’s at 350. You transfer Bitcoins. It takes 3 hours. 325. You make a trade. The site crashes before it’s done. Next day, it is back up, and we are at 275. You make the trade at 250. You could have had it at 350 had you registered. You finally get the money and have it transferred. Hey, $250,000 isn’t bad. But there is a transfer limit. You are not verified, so you transfer $10,000, the site’s daily limit. And you wait a week. And then you find out your bank does not accept transfers to savings accounts, only checking accounts. And by the time you fix this up, the trading site has gone bankrupt, and it takes you 3 years to finally get a claim in and get 20 cents on the dollar. Most could have been avoided by testing out the system with 0.1 Bitcoins.
Now by all means, support Bitcoins, start using them for trades, and encourage vendors to accept them. This ‘bubble’ is only a small part of the big picture. But for those of you who have $40K in bitcoins and only $300 in your pocket, well, this advice is for you.

I mod /r/bitcointip and have an exciting announcement.

With reddit's new mention feature, /u/nerdfightersean has set up the bot to work with it, allowing the bot to work all over reddit.

You used to have to donate to get this feature, as the bot would have to just analyze all your comments, and reddit-wide tipping could not exist, as it would be basically impossible to go through every comment on reddit as it came through.

However, now any user can tip in any subreddit, using some new syntax.

To tip the parent comment/post one dollar:

    +/u/bitcointip $1

To tip user Bob .5 BTC:

    +/u/bitcointip @Bob .5 BTC

Everything else works the same! In all subreddits that were enabled, the old syntax works as well.

Thanks for all the support reddit! 

For more info, check out the post on /r/bitcointip

Happy Tipping!

1366069895.0,662,self.Bitcoin,1cfbdt,Hi! I'm your next market. Here's why you scare me.,mcscreamy,811,149,347,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1cfbdt/hi_im_your_next_market_heres_why_you_scare_me/,"I believe I represent the next slice of the market for bitcoin.  I'm 30-something, male, liberal, and tech savvy by broad societal standards (I rooted my android phone and had ubuntu installed on a laptop at some point).  But I'm not a crypto-geek, I'm not a raging libertarian, and I don't do drugs.  

I dialed up bulletin board systems (BBSs) back in the days before the internet, and bitcoin feels a bit like that did for me - something that seems like it could be really big but still somehow missing its potential.  

Here's the problem.  I haven't bought any bitcoins.  Here's why:

1. The slew of posts talking about ""securing your wallet"".  A laptop with no hard drive?  Live linux installs? ""Disable all internet connections!"" etc.  Not to mentioin the stories that pop up of people ""missing"" bitcoins. I get it - online wallet's are not as secure but the work that goes into having a secure wallet on my deskstop seems to daunting.  Solution: An online wallet with some guarantees.

2. I can't spend it.  I don't want to buy drugs.  Every other place I can use bitcoin just instantly exchanges it for dollars.  If that's the case, I'll just spend dollars. Yes, I get the anonymity thing - but frankly if I'm buying something and having it sent to my house I'm not anonymous anyway.  Solution: make bitcoin purchases ""special"".  Add some value to it that dollars don't have.  Either a discount, or a ""locked in"" price or action figure.  Something.

3. Complexity of purchase.  I figured I'd buy a few bitcoins to play around with.  So far, I tried to open an account with Mt. Gox (still waiting verification) coinbase (couldn't buy coins) and now campbx (waiting for my dwolla transfer to go through).  For a guy like me, going to the bank with cash in hand is not a solution - I need to be able to buy these things from my home and with the speed I'm accustomed to. Solution? Coinbase does it right (but verification needs to be faster), but they don't have the depth to sell.  Someone needs to fill this void.

4. Complexity of the system:  Wait.  There is my wallet, then there are ""change wallets"" that somehow live within my wallet? I can increase transaction fee to speed up transfer?  I have seen so many posts that say ""If you can't understand it, don't buy it"".  This is exactly the wrong mentality to bring something like this mainstream.  It needs to be dead simple.  Idiot proof.  

Fix these things, and bitcoin can go mainstream. If not - I think we have another Prodigy (c) on our hands.

1369251650.0,660,self.Bitcoin,1eurf8,Bitcoin gets another day in court- I had to testify for 30 minutes,btcthinker,799,139,271,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1eurf8/bitcoin_gets_another_day_in_court_i_had_to/,"I invested in Bitcoin in June of 2012 and I've done pretty well since then. Today I was posting bond for a friend of mine who was booked on a drug-related charge and I sold some BTC to cover the bond. I had to produce statements from MtGox in order to show how I obtained the money. I was grilled by the prosecution for about 30 minutes regarding Bitcoin. The prosecution had looked up some stuff in Bitcoin and they were trying to argue that I might have obtained the money by illegitimate means (i.e. laundering money), but their arguments were dismissed pretty quickly by the judge. Mind you that pretty much nobody in the court room, including the defense, had any idea what Bitcoin was when we started.

**Some of the questions I was asked by the prosecution:**  
1. Is it true that Bitcoin is not regulated by any state?  
2. You are aware that MtGox is not a registered money transmitter?   
3. Bitcoin is not a real currency in the sense you can't use it in Wal-Mart, is that correct?  
4. Your MtGox account is not an investment account, such as a traditional mutual fund, stock or options, correct?  
5. Is it true that Bitcoin is not the official legal tender of any country or jurisdiction?  
6. Is it your understanding that Bitcoin is not regulated by FinCEN?  
7. Do you realize gains from the rise or fall of the current Bitcoin price?  
8. Do you know how Bitcoin mining works?  
9. Do you mine Bitcoins?  
(there are many other questions in the span of 30 minutes, but these were the ones that stood out)  

**My answers:**  
1. Yes, it's a decentralized currency so there is no country or state that controls it.  
2. Objection by defense and sustained.  
3. Is that relevant? (the judge said that he's going to determine if it's relevant and I should just answer the question) ... Yes, you can't use it in Wal-Mart. It's not a traditional currency in that sense.  
4. It's not a traditional investment account, but it's no different from investing in currency. (the judge and the prosecution went back and forth here about how one can invest in Dollar/Yen, Dollar/Euro and they agreed that it's an investment)  
5. Objection by the defense (asked and answered) and sustained.  
6. Yes. Objection by the defense, but it was overruled and I had already answered the question.  
7. Yes. It works just like any other investment: you buy in at a certain price and you sell at a different price. If I have profit, then that's a capital gain.  
8. Yes.  
9. No.  

**Statements by the prosecution (most of them dismissed by the judge):**  
1. Bitcoin is used for money laundering and other illegal activities.  
2. Bitcoin is not a real currency.  
He went on about how it's not regulated, it's not real currency and it's used for illegal activities such as money laundering, but the judge dismissed it saying that it's irrelevant. They also tried to suggest that money obtained from Bitcoin is not traceable, but the judge agreed with the defense that the statements from MtGox are sufficient to prove where the money came from. The judge also made statements that this seems to be in line with any other investment and it should be accepted as a legal source for the bond.  

**Closing statement from the defense (this was the best part):**  
""Some people like to keep their money in the bank, some keep it under the mattress and some invest it in geeky stuff like Bitcoin. **(the whole courtroom, including the judge, erupted in laughter)** However, that's not grounds for rejecting the bond. It is entirely reasonable that the witness, who is x-years-old, not married, has no children, has no mortgage and makes x amount of money per year is capable of producing the bond amount.""

All and all, it was pretty fun to be up there and testify in defense of both my friend and Bitcoin. I'll try to get the court transcripts and post them up here, it was pretty entertaining to see the prosecution struggle with Bitcoin.",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,1369259350.0,,,True,t3_1eurf8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1eurf8/bitcoin_gets_another_day_in_court_i_had_to/,

1366141878.0,649,self.Bitcoin,1chcv0,A message from wallstreet.,,834,185,326,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1chcv0/a_message_from_wallstreet/,"Full disclosure: I do have a position in bitcoins. 

The reason I feel compelled to write this is because I am SO tired of hearing people bitch or speculate that “wallstreet” somehow in some way has been manipulating the market. As a representative of one of the big 4 wirehouses, I thought perhaps one or two of you might be interested in my perspective on bitcoins. 

So I have been following bitcoins for a year or so now. Since about late March with the explosion of coverage I have made it my personal goal to survey as many people as I can in “the industry” on whether or not they too have any interest in bitcoins. The answer? Almost 0. Part in this is because the average age of a wallstreet employee is 62. I asked the simple question “hey, have you ever heard of bitcoins”. Even as recent as YESTERDAY the majority answer is “no” I get that about 80-90% of the time. I even called some people up in our FX department to ask – and even to my surprised the majority of the answers was “no”. I would say 1 in 5 respond “oh yeah I think I saw something about that in the paper yesterday - that look pretty stupid”. I’ve still yet to find another person in this industry that actually owns any coins (or at least would reveal to me they do).  

The notion that wallstreet is behind these “pump and dumps” is retarded. At its peak the bitcoin market cap was what $2.5 billion maybe $3 billion. Wow!!! The size of a mid-cap stock! Jee-wiz!! I could probably name 500 companies that none of you have heard of, that have a larger market cap than bitcoins. In the investment world a $2.5 billion market cap is nothing. The reality is, bitcoins act like a thinly traded penny stock. If a hedge fund manager really wanted to do a pump and dump, they would just use a small stock. The entry/exit is 1000000x easier than bitcoins. 

I think back to playing Diablo 2 and trading the “virtual goods” in that game. When a Windforce went from $20, to $40, to over $500 for a single Windforce did anyone think “wallstreet must be involved”. No, we simply understood there was an extremely high demand in our very niche market and within the community there was somebody out there comfortable spending $500 on an item that doesn’t even exist (tell that to my Amazon!).  

But what about all the articles on yahoo.com/finance &amp; cnn.com/money?!? No legitimate investor on wallstreet uses either of these mediums as a source for news. Even if this made the front page of Barrons or the WSJ – it would just be another one of those articles most people just skip over (like 3D printing, cloud technology, fracking in the US – all new and interesting technologies most investors don’t actually care about). 

My last 2 thoughts… 

Any mutual fund, hedge fund, or otherwise “fund” that takes people’s money for investments has to follow a prospectus. Yes, managers will bend the rules from time to time and invest outside of the box. Perhaps going 35% emerging markets when the prospectus says they can only go 30%. But there is NO CHANCE in HELL any of them would risk their firms asses to go so far outside the realm of what was set up to put real investors’ money in bitcoins. Yes, there was that ETF or two that was a “bitcoin ETF”. But hell… if you look deep enough I’m sure you can find a World of Warcraft ETF… There is one in practically every space. 

Me personally, I think bitcoins are only the one of the coolest “new” technology, right up there with 3D printing (I’m a HUGE fan of 3D printing). I do own some coins myself. I am NOT trying to flip a quick buck. I do try and tell everyone I know about how great they are – and how they could possibly change the way we do commerce. I am not trying to bash bitcoins or create another thread on “why the bitcoin bubble is over”. I simply wanted to share my insight and possible clarify to some – the reasons why wallstreet is not involved. 

I am more than happy to continue this conversation. On a complete side note – as a day trader I am more than happy to share in insight or prospective on any charts relative to BTC/LTC/PPC/TRC/NVC. I do REALLY enjoy trading alternate currencies as a hobby. Feel free to send me a PM.

Edit: Hey guys - as my first post, I'm totally blown away by all the responses. Really made for a fun night :)
2 Things I quickly wanted to point out...

By saying ""wall street isn't responsible for the pump and dumps"". Isn't my way of saying this isn't happening, in fact I would say it's pretty clear it is happening. I just think the more realistic answer is that it's just a person, or a few people manipulating everything. 

Thanks for all the feedback. I apologize about the noob moves I have made along the way. I should have probably lurked more before posting, but hey - gotta learn one way or another.

The biggest problem we face right now are from bitcoin services that will bring down the bitcoin economy if they fail.

I am aware of two current situations where this possibility exists today:

* Mt. Gox claims over 80% of transaction volume. If Mt. Gox fails, we all fail. The solution is to use other exchanges until the balance of power is leveled. Ideally, the top 5 exchanges should maintain about 20% of the market. [This post by Taenk about alternatives to Mt Gox is excellent](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b9sak/alternatives_to_mtgox/)

* BTC Guild has had nearly 50% of the mining pool share for all of recent history. If BTC Guild reaches 51% of the market share the mining pool could be used to fork the chain, leading to instability for bitcoin. It is simple to choose any of the other top 5 pools.

I'm holding for now. Really the only thing that will make me sell is if I see another cryptocurrency or equally brilliant piece of software that makes the featureset of bitcoin look antiquated. I don't see that happening very soon though. Some of you newbies are speculating on something you really don't even know the utility of.

By featureset I mean this.

1. Distributed, verifiable ledger: The blockchain is really a fancy name for a extremely secure ledger. It contains a record of every transaction that has occurred in the bitcoin ecosystem. This is an amazing achievement on its own. Can you imagine if the company you worked for had a system setup that kept track of all this information this reliably?

1. The ability to memorize a number (or brainwallet phrase), walk across a border and (provided ~~their~~ there is a local exchange) change your money back to whatever fiat currency is the accepted medium of exchange in that country.
3. The ability to have at-a-glance, verifiable, data about the entire bitcoin ecosystem. Statistical analysis is so much easier when you know your source data is accurate. http://blockchain.info/charts
4. We know, with almost certainty, how many bitcoins will have been created by the end of the day tomorrow, 2 weeks from now, and in the year 2140. If nothing else, this is an amazing economic experiment. We get to see what a known, controlled rate of ""coin"" production does to society. I personally like that knowledge.
5. Smart contracts could in the future change the way we do business, pass money to children, pay loans, etc. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts
6. Green addresses get around the double-spend problem. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Green_address
7. Merged mining and other alternative chains: ""Alternative chains have been suggested as ways to implement DNS, P2P currency exchanges, SSL certificate authorities, timestamping, file storage and voting systems."" Goodbye Diebold.
8. Sending money into outer space. Ok, I'm going out there with this one, but I think it's kind of fun. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=56285.0
9. Many other features already realized.
10. Other features that have not been invented yet.

Sorry for the ramblings, just getting tired of the rampant, ""OMG!!!1!!! $120/BTC"" stuff that is going on in this place. It's the featureset that we should be selling, it's not just ""internet gold"" or ""internet cash,"" it's a novel thing.

For those who don't know me, I've been heavily involved in Bitcoin since May 2011. It is my full time life, my career, and my passion. The price in 2013 has been wild, and here's what I wrote to my family member. 

--------------

Unfortunately, while I'm certainly an insider, not even I know if the price will rise or fall tomorrow, or next week, or next month, or next year. Guessing short term price movements is a fool's game. 

My sentiment is the same today as it was a year or two years ago:  either Bitcoin is worth zero, or is worth thousands of dollars each. It will take years for the market to figure out which it is.  If you believe in the Bitcoin story, that it may revolutionize the world of finance, then it's a good idea to hold on to some Bitcoins. If you think it's just too risky, or are unconvinced of the narrative, then it's best to sell. As stated many times, Bitcoins are incredibly risky and volatile. The whole thing is one grand experiment. Don't ever hold more money in Bitcoin than you can afford to lose, and in general you should assume the whole thing will go to zero.

Now, if you're curious why this price may be going crazy right now, it's a few factors:

1) A handful of ""respectable"" online merchants are now accepting Bitcoin, this proves that real businesses see the value in it. It's likely that others will follow.

2)  Cyprus scared the hell out of everyone (and rightly so). While a few Cypriots may have bought some Bitcoin, the bigger influence is a world of onlookers who are all thinking, ""well that could happen to US!"" and ""look how Bitcoin solves the problem of trusting banks."" It's not so much that Cypriots are buying bitcoins now, but rather that the world realizes that as this euro (and soon dollar...) crisis continues unfolding, a greater number of people will seek some degree of refuge in Bitcoin. Speculators, seeing this possibility, are buying up Bitcoins.

3) Venture capital (and private investor) money is moving into Bitcoin. A handful of VC firms putting in a handful of money would explain the current price rise.
 
4) An increasingly wide swath of the libertarian/gold &amp; silver ""hard money"" types are buying into Bitcoin. They were very skeptical at first, but are coming around. There are probably a few hundred thousand people like this in America who are deciding to put a few grand into Bitcoin.

5) The FinCEN ruling clarified the government's stance on Bitcoin about 3 weeks ago. The good news is Bitcoin is very much legal, and will be treated basically like money. People don't need to worry that the government will come down on it any time soon.

6) The press attention gained from all of the above real-world events is fueling a huge amount of hype (justified or not). 

7) Ignorant, foolish people are buying bitcoins simply because the price is going up and they think (consciously or unconsciously) that this means it'll go up tomorrow. Maybe 1% of the buying interest is from people like this, or maybe 99%. Such people may get really lucky, or impoverish themselves, but either way they're in it for the wrong reason.

All of the above have combined over the past couple months to cause this price rally. It may well be a bubble, and could fall back down to $20/coin. Or, it could be the ""new normal"" and a new stable price between $100-$300 will be found. Or, it could be the start of a mega bubble that drives prices over $1000 before they come crashing down somewhere and cause widespread misery and chaos. The price right now could be the highest Bitcoin will ever be from now on, or the lowest. Nobody knows!

My advice... don't obsess over the fluctuating price on any given day. The market will figure out the value of these coins, and there ain't a damn thing anyone can do to prevent this from playing out. 

But certainly, Bitcoin is the most important thing happening on the planet right now... and it has nothing to do with the price.

I've been a long-time lurker of /r/bitcoin myself and have always viewed it with great interest, both from a macroeconomic cryptocurrency standpoint (my first job out of college was in online payments), as well as from a technical perspective.  It's a really great piece of technical work, actually.

As you can see, [we've recently launched support for using BTC to buy reddit Gold](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/18j91l/new_gold_payment_options_bitcoin_and_credit_card/).  You can see in the comments on that blog post that a lot of people still don't understand bitcoin, so this is a great opportunity for the Bitcoin community to educate reddit and the world about what Bitcoin is and how it's beneficial.

Next, I do want to set some expectations: despite its considerable potential, Bitcoin is still very new, experimental, and no one really knows what will happen with it and what people will do with it.  It is this way with all new technologies.  This means that there is the possibility that unexpected or bad things happen, and we may have to modify or suspend our implementation of Bitcoin support if that happens.  We think that adding Bitcoin support is very worthwhile, but having worked in the online payments industry for awhile for a player (PayPal) which in its early years hoped greatly to reform and revolutionize the global money system, I know that things can be complicated and not always turn out the way you intend them.  I hope things go well, and so I ask the Bitcoin supporters here to help us make that happen.  I believe that adding Bitcoin support to reddit will help it gain a fair bit of press, and spark more widespread discussion and understanding about it.

Finally, don't think I've forgotten about the pledges all y'all were so quick to make [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/12vg6t/the_admins_are_considering_bitcoin_as_a_new/).

Let me be clear here, you do not need to dig a hole in the ground and murder people to keep your bitcoins safe.  Furthermore, I am not a security expert by any means.**

I've worked in the computer security industry almost since it was created, and I've heard a lot of misconceptions on this subreddit about how to securely use bitcoin.  I thought it would be helpful to provide a few *common sense* steps *anybody* can use to safely secure their bitcoins.

1.  You simply cannot trust computer hardware manufacturers.  [Hardware Backdoor's](http://www.darkreading.com/advanced-threats/black-hat-researcher-demonstrates-hardwa/240004674) are real and more prevalent than you can imagine.  The only way to be sure you aren't susceptible is to design and build your own CPU and computer system.  Fabricating your own silicon chips is a [surprisingly simple process](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GQmtITMdas), as all you really need is some sand.  

2.  Once you've hand manufactured your CPU, Motherboard, RAM, and IO devices, you'll need to write a C compiler that will compile down to your CPU's native language.  Writing your own compiler will keep you safe from the [Ken Thompson Hack](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheKenThompsonHack).

3.  Create a simple OS that you can use to access the internet.  Some people might suggest using Linux, but there are 9,868,933 lines of code in just the Kernel, most of which you won't need, and personally verifying every line for [rootkits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit) might take a bit longer than you have the patience for.

4.  Create your own bitcoin client.  Satoshi's client could possess hidden back doors, or they could have been introduced since his departure.  The classic [create-a-currency-to-compromise-a-users-computer-attack](https://ripple.com/) is devastating, and we can't rule Satoshi out.  Bottom line is that you cannot be sure.

5.  Dig a very deep hole into the earth, and surround it with at least three feet of re-enforced concrete.  Place your custom PC in there. Thermal imaging attacks can easily penetrate the walls of your home, and reveal your private keys to any wayward onlooker, or high tech peeping tom.  A sufficiently deep hole will also protect you against common [keystroke sound vibration attacks](http://gcn.com/articles/2011/10/18/smart-phone-sensors-steal-keystrokes.aspx).  Also, if you've had any help so far, this hole will double as their grave.

6.  Before generating your public private key pair, carefully run your hands over your head to ensure that you don't have any suspicious electrodes attached to your skull.  [Mind Reading technology is real](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/03/augcog-continue/).

7.  Once your wallet is setup, [Quantum Encrypt it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography) so that any attempts to access it will immediately destroy the information.  

8.  This is the most important: *Never leave your re-enforced hole in the ground*.  Leaving your hole makes you susceptible to the highly effective (despite what Bill O'Reilly would have you believe)  [water-boarding-private-key-extraction-attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding).

So long as you follow these simple 8 steps, you'll be reasonably safe against any would be attacker, assuming of course the entire universe isn't just a simulation running on Satoshi's computer.",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,1368339062.0,,,True,t3_1e4b9s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1e4b9s/the_only_truly_secure_way_to_use_bitcoin_from_a/,

I think that they're revolutionary, game changing, world shattering, and the tip of an iceberg that could potentially restore freedom back to the US and the rest of the world.

That being said, let me give you a bit of advice from someone who specifically studied the psychology of trading in a forum based environment when forum members had something to gain.

**Don't listen to ANYTHING that anyone tells you to do on a forum where others have something to gain by telling you to buy, hold, or sell at any particular time.  Use you own mind, and your own thoughts, as they are our truest weapons of survival and prosperity as humans, and we give up that survival and prosperity when we let others think for us.**

The statement above was hard earned through the tech bubble, the banking crisis (where I saw the Fed Chairman lie directly to the public) and by closely watching the forums of gold game ponzy investments, where the cheer leading, nay saying, and self-delusion often reach psychotic levels.

So, what am I saying with this post?  Should you buy or sell or stuff your bitcoins in your mouth as a ward against demons?

**I'm saying that you need to think.  Forget about what you want to happen at this moment, and sit down with a pencil and paper and start diagramming out all of the possibilities that could happen, how likely you think (not feel, but think) they are to happen, what impact they will have if they do happen, and what strategy you can use that gives the best results based on this.**

And if your strategy is to hold, then hold.  If it is to sell, then sell.  If it is to buy, then buy.  If it is to sell now to possibly buy cheaper, then do so.  And don't let anyone tell you that you're wrong, evil, or an asshole for using your mind and doing what you want with your property and resources.  It's yours not theirs, and they are wrong to even suggest that they have a claim to what you do with it.",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,1365707066.0,,,True,t3_1c5ila,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c5ila/repeat_after_me_i_have_no_moral_obligation_to_buy/,

The full list includes Netscape, AOL, eBay, Yahoo!, Lycos, GeoCities, HotMail, Tim Berners-Lee, and Marc Andreessen.

FBI Director Robert Mueller issued the following statement: ""If the Internet remains a virtual Wild West for narcotraffickers and other criminals, that would not only threaten our country’s national security, but also the very existence of the Internet industry as a legitimate business enterprise.""

Indeed, experts have speculated on the possibility of Internet applications that aid terrorists and put at risk our national security interests.

""Suppose maps become digitized and freely available on the Internet"" says a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. ""Suddenly, terrorists have access to military grade technology for selecting, scoping, and planning their attacks. Citizens will be helpless. Access to such tools must be strictly controlled""

Technologies to send mail electronically, dubbed ""e-mail,"" have also raised concerns. Experts predict that this tool will be exploited by pedophiles around the world to distribute child pornography. ""Regulation of E-mail is our top priority"" says Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe. ""We have made it our goal to ensure that every E-mail sent is tracked and stored. This database will be made accessible to law enforcement officials around the country, to ensure our nations safety.""

Cyber-anarchists, who oppose regulation of the Internet, have pushed forward the dangerous concept of ""net-neutrality.""  This idea has been denounced by spokesmen for the movie, music, radio, newspaper, book, magazine, advertising,  television, and sports industries: ""It will destroy jobs, plain and simple. Net-neutrality is nothing more than a ploy to subvert and destroy our time tested business models.""

Not all in the industry oppose regulation, however. Says Cisco CEO John Chambers: ""Regulation is a sign that the Internet is reaching mainstream acceptance, which is why we are partnering with the NSA to install hardware based tracking on all our routers. Such moves can only bring legitimacy to the Internet.""",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,False,,,True,t3_1k9hcy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k9hcy/if_the_internet_were_invented_in_2013/,

You can view the reddit thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1cmike/bitcoin_buzz_draws_western_union_moneygram/).

Now, this is very early, and they may not go forward with it. But many big businesses, such as reddit and namecheap, began accepting bitcoins because users like us continued to ask for it. Showing interest goes a long way.

If you think Western Union incorporating bitcoin in their business is a good idea, I highly suggest sending them feedback and telling them. 

To do this:

&gt; Go to [https://thewesternunion.custhelp.com/app/home/](https://thewesternunion.custhelp.com/app/home/) 

&gt; Click ""Give Feedback"" on the right-hand side of the page, in the Contact Center. 

I personally think this would be huge. Western Union already has the infrastructure to make improvements to bitcoin, and it would go a long way in legitimizing it as a currency.

The game plan is to shut down 0.8 nodes and continue on the 0.7 fork. Do not trust new transactions at present.,KuDeTa,575,118,279,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1a4ab0/alert_payattention_a_block_was_mined_that_was_too/,"Join bitcoin-dev for further updates (please don't pester while people work). Looks like the chain was forked by a bug in 0.7. 0.8 nodes didn't suffer and carried on. A solution is in the works. 

**What do I do??: If your not mining, just sit tight - 0.8 is fine. If you are mining, ask your pool (go back to 0.7) **


**Coins/Transactions from bad blockchains ('orphans')  have merged back into the valid blockchain, everything is cool**


At present, devs are working to establish the precise cause of the bug. We know it's related to the way 0.7 and 0.8 handle the DBD database, specifically, locks and related to the way satoshiDICE was processing bets and sending them to the chain. For now, 0.7 is the way to mine, users can feel free to continue to rely on 0.8 for getting chain updates. I imagine soon enough we will see 0.8.1 and the possibility of a hard fork (0.8 may become incompatible) so keep your eyes open for more news. 

There is, on the side the interrelated and ever present issue of maxblocksize, which needs to be fixed for scalability of the network, but it is not the cause of the bug. 

Finally, some praise to the developers, mining pools markets and websites (such as satoshiDICE) that all came together in a mater of minutes to sort this out.

1371820357.0,429,self.Bitcoin,1gsiwy,An Update from Mt. Gox,WeAreMtGox,529,100,170,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gsiwy/an_update_from_mt_gox/,"Dear Mt. Gox Customers and Bitcoiners,

The reaction since yesterday’s statement regarding the temporary suspension of U.S. dollar withdrawals has had mixed reactions, and raised more than a few questions about why we had to take this step right now. Rather than be subject to inaccurate speculation we’d like to clarify some points here. Due to pending matters we are unable to get into everything in great detail, though we’d certainly love to and are looking forward to the opportunity.

1) The problem with the U.S. withdrawals (and even other currencies for that matter) is that our bank can no longer handle the volume of withdrawals. They struggled in the last two months, and the increase due to the Dwolla separation has made it increasingly more difficult. The pressure we brought onto the bank’s resources finally gave in, and we are now working with them to find an alternative method (hence the suspension). We would have preferred to give notice if we were able to, but it was sudden for us as well. 

2) We are now working with new banks and alternative methods for transmitting money to our customers. This does not mean we are stopping entirely within the next two weeks, but it will be slower than we would like. We are literally going to use our manpower to process withdrawals ourselves, manually. This will take more time, but we are dedicated to doing as many per day as possible. We announced a suspension in order to manage expectations while we deliver at a temporary reduced rate. Our goal is to have a new system set up in the next weeks with clarity for both the banks and for our customers. 

3) Our previous release was rather vague, but for a reason. Mainly, we don't want to upset our bank! They do great work, but our kind of business is completely new to the banking industry. Processing international wires does not just involve pushing a button. It requires real manpower processing everything individually, even in this modern computer age. While Bitcoin's power lies in its ability to transfer fast and securely through software, the rest of the financial world does not operate like that (contrary to popular opinion). Money is surprisingly analog in many ways, and scarily digital in others.  

4) Every customer’s funds are safe, sound, and accounted for. In fact, in our dealings with the Japanese financial regulators we have been assured that we are not under local pressure or suspicion and can operate as usual within normal legal frameworks. 

5) Mt. Gox is certainly not a martyr, but it would be hard to argue that we aren’t ""taking one for the team"" as far as Bitcoin is concerned. We are a big target, and are absorbing the frustrations of Bitcoiners, regulators, banks, and a media that still doesn't quite understand what Bitcoin is. This is a job we are happy to fill, and not just because we are compensated for it. Our hope is that, once Bitcoin finds its place, we will be able to say that we made a difference in sorting it all out in the early days. New exchanges, business models, merchants, traders, and consumers  are rising up to innovate and create a whole new way of doing business. A lot of lawyers are getting new cars in the meantime too. 

6) As risky as it is to invoke the name of Litecoin (LTC???), we must apologize for not keeping everyone up to date. The fact is that the current situation means a continued delay, but for good reasons. We’re looking at July right now, though that depends on a few things. Mainly, we want to do things correctly from the beginning. 

7) The new trading engine is finished, is smokin’ fast, and is currently undergoing bench tests. We’re looking forward to deploying it very soon. 

While not the most in-depth update we'd like to give, we hope that it has at least clarified a few things. In the next few weeks we are planning to do another AMA on Reddit when we’ll hopefully be able to answer many more questions and also shed some light on what’s been going on at Mt. Gox these past months. Thank you for your patience and support. ",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,False,,,True,t3_1gsiwy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gsiwy/an_update_from_mt_gox/,

I suggest this ban because cryptocoinsnews does not provide relevant content to match the volume of misleading, inaccurate, or false postings.

**Update 7/11/2013 1830EST Mod /u/jesset77 responds [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1i0962/this_is_my_petition_to_ask_the_mods_to_configure/cb0r7np):**

Well, I did comment on /u/PLURFellow's thread last week. :3 /u/TonyBuddz commented there as well and got called out on the one-shot accounts. While there's no proof those are his, any other explanation is quite unlikely.

The front I have taken thus far with ccn is that submissions which directly break the rules (including obvious plagiarism which we enforce while not having a strict rule for) get individually marked as spam. /u/PLURFellow and /u/xrandr in particular have been quite helpful at reporting and disambiguating rulebreaking posts.

I view banning an entire domain as a big step for a number of reasons. Not least of which is sparking an arms race of throwaway domains and url shortners, not dissimilar from the battle we are already waging against the mtgix/bitswing/emocoe operators. But if our community feels the effort of calling out the individual submissions as we have done is too great, then you'll have my vote.

We do already have a bot mod that is cousins with Automoderator. /u/theymos runs it so ultimately he's the chap you'd need to sell on the idea of opening up the domain-banning can o worms. :3

Amagi Metals would like to reach out to the bitcoin community for your help and support.

We have worked with BotW since 2011. In the last month they began requesting information about our business and claiming that we were a Money Service Business (MSB). However we only accept bitcoins as a payment method, we do not sell bitcoins, nor do we exchange or ""deal"" bitcoins. In addition we are compliant with AML/KYC and other regulations.

Today we heard back from the bank that they are closing down our account and that we can no longer use BotW after mid-August. They think that we are a ""risk"" because we accept bitcoins as a payment method.

So, we need your help! Can anyone suggest a bitcoin friendly bank located in the United States so that we may continue doing business after mid-August?

Please note that we plan on continuing business as usual and this will not affect our current business operations. Thank you for all your help and support!

Gox using [bitcoincharts.com's API](http://bitcoincharts.com/about/markets-api/).

The script basically just looks at the timestamp of all the trades, and sees how many trades appear with the same timestamp. The result is that no more than 37 trades appear in the historic trade data with the same timestamp.

The period I've analyzed is from 2013-04-09 17:00 UTC to 2013-04-14 17:00 UTC. So from before the crash and to now-ish.

Here's the script: https://github.com/runeksvendsen/mtgoxtps/blob/master/tradespersec.py

Script output when analyzing the above period:

**EDIT:** I just updated the script to also use Mt. Gox' own API from [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MtGox/API/HTTP/v1#Multi_currency_trades). This doesn't let you specify a time period though, it seems to only return the trades from the past 24 hours.

Hi,
A website called Blockch**ia**n.info is been used to steal Blockchain.info accounts.

Nobody has reported this phishing website to Google Safebrowsing (this database is used in Google Chrome, Firefox and some antivirus to show a red alert).

The owner of the phising website is flooding /r/bitcoin, Bitcointalk and BTC-E's chatbox with the phising link.

This website looks similar to Blockchain.info and prompts a form to login into Blockchain account.

* Blockchain ORIGINAL LINK:
http: //blockchain.info


* Blockchain PHISHING LINK:
http: //blockchian.info (PLEASE DO NOT CLICK)


They look pretty similar, note the CHAIN vs CHIAN

http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1dmjyg/bitcoin_from_a_banker_prospective_a_serious/

We have decided to offer Private International banking to Bitcoin Customers, Merchants and Traders where they will be provided the following:

1) A private individual or corporate bank account with Online Banking access.

2) The option to receive your own Visa debit card under your account

3) Instant Transfer of funds internally to any other of our Bank account to exchange fiat to Bitcoin and vice versa.

4)Wire funds directly to your own account instead of collective exchange account

5)Wire money out at any time on your schedule and not on the schedule of the Exchange

5)Support of 22 Currencies so you can maintain your funds at your choice of Currency without converting to USD, EUR etc.

We are in the process of working out our terms and fees as we try to keep the fees such as wire in wire out and any maintenance fees to the bare minimum.

we would not use your funds for loans or credit, your money is your money. 

Exclusively for Virtual Currencies.

All KYC/AML verification will take place prior to opening your account.

The Goal is to eventually be able to offer you the option to trade Fiat &lt;&gt; Bitcoin instantly the same way 
your bank converts your USD &lt;&gt; EUR &lt;&gt; JPY today.

**We are currently setting it as a subsidiary of our Bank and would like your input at choosing a Name!**

**If you personally had an account with Bitfloor or Bitcoin-24 Please PM me as we would like to learn and avoid
some of their mistakes. Thank you**

I don't use facebook as I think it's quite silly but if you know anybody that does, spread the word.

I've fixed a few things:

* footer share links now work in Firefox
* If the recipient facebook user does not have the app installed, the status message has a link that has the request all ready to go. Click and submit and they will see to install the app.
* I'm very sorry to the few people who have submitted translations, I didn't have the data properly UTF8 encoded before saving the form response. This has now been fixed.

**Update 13/4/4 13:30 UTC-8**

* Fixed browser bugs and now works in: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE9, IE8, IE7, and Safari (Clear your cache if you are seeing issues still before posting them)

**Update 13/4/4 22:20 UTC-8**

* Code is now up on github: https://github.com/numtel/bitcoin-tx

**Update 13/4/5 15:20 UTC-8**

* Translations for Slovak and Turkish are now installed.

**Update 13/4/8 13:30 UTC-8**

* In transaction history table, transactions to users without app installed now have user name as link to send another request for app install.

**Updated 13/4/10 13:00 UTC-8**

* Transactions to users who never install the app will be reverted automatically after 60 days.
* Nederlands translation added.

It's a 'tech cafe' where creative types hang out and work on software and hardware and stuff. I asked the boss man if I could pay with bitcoins, and to my great surprise he said yes! Not only did he say yes, but a whole group of Chinese people who had never heard of BTC before were fascinated, and my friends and I, and the boss, spent the evening educating a whole group of Chinese people about the wonders of BTC.

What's more, when I told the boss that we hold bitcoin meetups (expecting around 30 people at the next one), he offered up the venue for our next meetup, and to let attendees spend bitcoin for their drinks -- the old venue didn't want to accept them. If the meetup goes well and has good turnout, the owner will consider officially accepting BTC at the cafe.

I still visit China every couple years or so.*

*I'm fluent in Chinese, French, and English, and I've owned a fair share of bitcoins since mid 2012 and litecoins since two months ago.*

Here's what I thought of the CCTV Documentary from the perspective of someone who's originally from China, understands the culture, and owns bitcoins.

**= Initial Reactions =**

- The documentary was fairly accurate, covered the basics of bitcoin, it's history, how mining works, and the prices.
- The documentary seemed to be pro-bitcoin, and covered the story of a man who mines and has made some money doing so.
- It is clear that the Chinese government (who does in fact censor, this I can confirm with first hand experience) has given Bitcoin the go-ahead.
- CCTV is pretty big in Chinese news, and will be widely watched.  Whether or not the citizens would be interested in a documentary about a currency is another story.

**= Ramifications =**

- I believe we'll see more news coverage on BTC in China, as bloggers and various sources see the story, gain interest and begin to explore BTC.  This is important because most Chinese internet users are heavy blog readers.
- Many Chinese citizens are fairly technologically savy, especially in the younger age group.  If they want bitcoins, they'll get them.
- If China decides to adopt/promote bitcoin, that is a HUGE amount of new users (even if only a small percent who sees the broadcast decides to get bitcoins).
- To Chinese citizens, the idea of a decentralized and PRIVATE currency would be a godsend to them.  The challenge would be getting them to spend it on everyday goods as there is a lack of merchants in China.

**= Predictions =**

- If the Chinese bitcoin exchange fairs well and plays it's cards right, it may even overtake MtGox as the major exchange by numbers alone.
- Chinese companies will begin to produce cheaper and more powerful mining 
- The price will shoot up as citizens begin buying coins.  However, it may fall later on.
- Chinese hackers will realize how effective the denial of service operations were, and may attempt a similar attack.
- The Chinese blackmarket may very well adopt bitcoin and begin selling goods and services on a platform.  They may use Silkroad, or they might even start their own.

**All said, I think that this is pretty big news, and we'll see some interesting things happen to Bitcoin in the coming days.**

Here's their response.

&gt;""While there is interest from the BitCoin Mining community, AMD currently has no plan to create a mining-specific card, since the demand on a global scale would be so small that spending thousands of dollars on R&amp;D and development for cards that might be purchased by a couple thousand people worldwide wouldn't make financial sense (since at least half of the miners would keep their existing rigs for a couple years first). Our Radeon cards are still more than sufficient for Mining, but until the interest is deemed sufficient enough from the mining community, the prospect of a specialized mining card will remain a prospect. This may change as more retailers start accepting BitCoins, but for now there is no plan to release a dedicated mining card.""  -AMD Global Support

And now some of you people can afford donating non-negligible amount to such development. Maybe it is time?

1. I'm already working on [colored coins](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=106373.0) project, which is an advanced feature (related to [Smart Property](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Smart_Property)), perhaps a bit too advanced :)

2. But I believe people badly need things like blockchain-based escrow, dispute mediation, secure zero-confirmation payments etc.

3. I want, but can't implement these things myself because I'm already committed to colored coin project; but I can help to organize a bounty campaign. I currently manage bounties for colored coin projects, I can't say it is terribly successful, but it works, 50 BTC is already paid in bounties and some success is achieved.

4. Shouldn't Bitcoin Foundation manage grants? Maybe it should, but it seems a bit bureaucratic, for my taste. I can't even find a list of grant proposals on Bitcoin Foundation web site.

5.  I don't want to get these features next year, I want them NOW, like next week. I'm crazy like that. I've implemented [a proof-of-concept of decentralized market](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/16w5vp/colored_bitcoins_armoryx_p2ptrade_gui_is_here/) in matter of weeks.

6. I don't want to hold anybody's coins; I simply want you to pledge some amount of Bitcoins, then I'll connect you to people who implemented something worthwhile and you'll pay them directly. (They will include their Bitcoin addresses in github commits.)

7. Here's more info about what kind of things I want to see: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1a6ewu/ive_been_waiting_for_a_usable_blockchain_escrow/c8ui49g), [2](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=152200.0), [3](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=141536.msg1507716#msg1507716).

You might all be panicking due to the price events of the past week. First a big drive of the price up over the week, and then a sharp dive during the weekend. ~~This is nothing unusual.~~ These volatile price fluctuations happen from time to time.

~~The online exchanges process your Bitcoins 24/7, but can only process your bank transfers during the weekdays. This means that during the weekend one can expect a shortage of cash at the exchanges and subsequently a drop in price.~~

~~Moreover, there is a self-fulfilling prophecy among day traders that the price of Bitcoin always falls on the weekend, which is also perpetuated.~~

Lastly, during some buying and selling frenzies, MtGox has a tendency of not being able to keep up with the load and lagging behind. This can cause price to fluctuate out of control before people have a chance to react to the changes (this is what happened on the 12th of March).

So my advice to all of you newcomers:

 - [Don't panic](http://allymalinenko.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dont-panic.jpg)
 - Invest only as much in Bitcoin as you can afford to lose
 - Unless you are a day trader, don't try to buy and sell like one - you will lose money
 - ~~Weekend dips are a common occurrence~~
 - When you are new to Bitcoin, treat it as a hobby - you are here to enjoy yourself, not to earn money
 - If you decide to stick around for longer, you should probably be in for the long run - in a few years the value of Bitcoin will be either through the roof, or be non existent. Try not to lose your money daytrading in the meantime.

Following those guidelines you should have a more enjoyable time. However, I am not your financial advisor or an economist - you should always make your own decisions and not follow blindly any advise you find on the Internet. [Do your own research first](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/).

EDIT:

As people pointed out, some of my assumptions were not well researched - I admit to that.

I wrote this guide because I believe that an informed userbase is key to Bitcoin's success!

Rough summary TL;DR:

* User Bob creates a transaction by declaring: ""I give Alice 10 BTC"". (But in Bitcoin protocol language).
* This transaction is digitally signed with the private key each address has and can't be forged.
* The miners make sure the transaction is valid and record it in a public ledger that is distributed over the whole network.
* Alice check this ledger to get her balance.
* Bob can't cheat the system because everyone in the network can consult and check this ledger and would immediately refuse a transaction with double spent funds or funds he hasn't got in the first place.

-----

You can start using Bitcoin in a matter of seconds and, although it is a very simple process, it is strongly recommended that you learn about how it works and what is happening to your coins when you make a simple transaction.

With Bitcoin it is you who has control over the money and you need to take care of it responsibly. 

**The following text is a very simple guide that will introduce you to the nature of the Bitcoin network and explain what happens during a Bitcoin transaction in a very simple way.**

*The Story of Alice and Bob*

Once upon a time... there was a reddit user called Bob who wanted to send his friend Alice some bitcoins. He knows that Alice needs 10 BTC and so he decided to send them to her. 

Bob has got a Bitcoin Wallet with some bitcoins and before clicking the send button he wonders where his bitcoins are actually stored. *""Is every Bitcoin a file on my computer? Or a serial number maybe?*""

Bob quickly notices that this would be very inefficient. What would happen if someone was spying on his connection and intercepted this files? And what would happen if the connection dropped?

No. **The way Bitcoin works is simple and elegant.**

When Bob sends Alice 10 Bitcoin, what he is actually doing is digitally signing a *declaration of payment*. In human language this would look something like this: 

""I, Bob, send the amount of 10 BTC to Alice"". 

Of course, Bob is also worried that someone might actually forge such a declaration in his name. He also knows that bitcoins are impossible to forge. So how exactly are they protected?

These declarations are protected by a mechanism known as [Digital Signature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature). It is an implementation of mathematics and very strong cryptography that guarantees that only the owner can produce a valid signature. Else, the signature would be invalid and the transaction would be rejected by everybody. 

**Digital Signatures**

You probably already know that in order to receive and send bitcoins you need a Bitcoin adress. Just like with email. And just like with email you need ""your password"" to be able to send and receive bitcoins. 

Bitcoin Adresses are generated using mathematics and they can be generated in a decentralized manner. You don't need to login anywhere nor do you need to be online. You just need a program capable of generating such an address. 

A Bitcoin address, just like your email account, is made up of two different things: 

* **A public part** - Give this to anybody so they can send you bitcoins. 

* **A private key** - This is what most users don't know. Each Bitcoin address has got it's own very unique key. Most Bitcoin programs don't tell you about this and they keep the keys hidden from the user, basically because it is very important that ONLY you have access to this key and showing them around is not a good idea.

This is the key used to digitally sign a transaction and to guarantee that only the owner of the key can emit a valid transaction and thus spend those bitcoins.

**Back to Alice and Bob**

Once Bob's bitcoin wallet has signed this transaction, he sends it across the Bitcoin P2P network. All people who use Bitcoin and are running a Bitcoin client, are connected to each other in order to receive and send these ""declarations"". 

Bob's transaction gets relayed from node to node. These nodes verify that the signature is valid and pass it on until, in a fraction of a second, Alice gets notified by her Bitcoin program that she got bitcoins from Bob!

*""Nice!""* Alice thinks. But at the same time she's worried about something else. Alice knows how the Bitcoin network works and ponders whether it was possible for Bob to make up that amount. 

She knows for sure that it was Bob who sent the money because the digital signature matches. But what would have stopped Bob from writing down any arbitrary amount? What if Bob would have said ""I give 1 Bazillion Bitcoins to Alice?"". *Whie Alice keeps thinking about it, she is unaware that the transaction that was sent to her is still hopping around the network and has a very important role to play...*

**Meet Miner Steve**

As the transaction keeps hopping from node to node in the Bitcoin network, it will also reach this person who is playing a very peculiar game: a sort of racing game. Steve and many other people who ""play"" this same sort of game are called miners. 

Steve's objective is to collect all transactions and publish them in a sort of ledger. In order to guarantee Bitcoin's decentralized and open nature, this must be done in a very specific way. 

Miner Steve and other miners are running a program on their computer that helps them solve extremely difficult mathematical problems. Steve knows that only the miner who finds the solution to such a problem is authorized to publish the next block of this ledger that contains all the collected transactions.

All miners are competing with each other because they want to be the first to solve the problem, publish the transactions and get a Bitcoin reward for it. (Actually more than a game it's a job).

In order for Bob to have 10 BTC in the first place, he must have gotten them previously from someone else. Steve checks the part of the ledger that has already been published previously by other miners and makes sure that the transaction is there, recorded somewhere. This tells him that Bob had 10 BTC in the first place and is thus authorized to spend them. Then he just hopes that, with a little bit of luck, his computer program is the first one to find the solution. 

*Guess what?* Today's Steve's lucky day! 
He finds the solution and immediately publishes all the transactions he has collected. The rest of the network verifies that the solution is correct and watches dumbfolded as Steve gets the reward. But there's no time to lose because new transactions never stop arriving and new blocks of this ledger always await to be published. 

**The blockchain**

This ledger is known as the Blockchain. It is called a chain, because all published blocks depend on the previous. They are protected by a cryptographic function known as hash. 

What if someone decided to maliciously edit a previous block and assign themselves thousands and thousands of bitcoins? Fortunately this is impossible. If one were to change one single digit, character or bit from the blockchain, all following blocks would be invalidated. 

Also, notice that not even Miner Steve can maliciously edit Bob's transaction because the digital signature would not match if he tampered with it. 

The openness, transparency and decentralized nature of the Bitcoin system together with the use of these protection mechanisms create a solid, strong and reliable Bitcoin network, where absolutely no one can cheat. 

**Back to Alice**

As soon as Miner Steve published the next block of the blockchain, it was redistributed over the whole network until it reached Alice. Once it got to Alice, her Bitcoin Wallet Program checked it to see if there were any transactions that involved her and, as it was the case, made sure to inform Alice that her transaction was *confirmed* and is now a permanent part of the Bitcoin network. **Transactions that are included in the blockchain receive a confirmation.**

Notice how Alice doesn't need to be online in order to receive bitcoins. She could be offline for hours, days or years and still receive bitcoins with no problem. As soon as she gets online, her program will download the latest blocks of the blockchain and inform her of any incoming transactions. 

Actually, the only thing Alice will ever need is her private key. She can even keep the private key printed on a piece of paper (paper wallet) and receive bitcoins at the same time. 

Once she wants to spend them, she would import the private key to a Bitcoin Wallet Program and the program would then read the blockchain to inform her about her balance. Also, since she's got her private key she will be able to digitally sign a valid transaction and spend them. 

Take a look at http://www.bitaddress.org . This is an online Bitcoin Adress generator that lets you see the private key. 

**About Bitcoin Security**

As you can see, Bitcoin is extremely secure and absolutely no one who does not know the private key to a public address will be able to spend bitcoins without authorization. 

You are the sole owner of your bitcoins and it is thus your responsibility to keep the private key to those coins safe. Many bitcoin wallets will encrypt these keys using a password you provide. This is extremely recommended. 

Also make sure that your computer is free from keyloggers, trojans and malware. If you hold large amounts of coins you might want to consider creating a paper wallet, as no virus in the world can get in your drawer and printed documents. 

**Where does Miner Steve get the reward from?**

He gets it from the voluntary fees that are included in each Bitcoin transaction. That's why he wants to collect and publish as much transactions as possible because he gets the fees associated with them. 

Also, every time he publishes a block he's allowed to write his name in the new block and assign himself 25 newly minted bitcoins. This is how new bitcoins get into circulation and injected into the economy in a decentralized manner. This reward will gradually decrease until there are 21 million bitcoins in circulation, which is the maximum amount that will ever be available. 

Are 21 million bitcoins enough? Yes, because they are divisible up to eight decimals. This amount of divisibility guarantees that there will never be a lack of bitcoins. 

**Why does it take so long for my Bitcoin Wallet to synchronize?**

The first time you run a full Bitcoin Wallet, it'll need to download the Blockchain in order to read it and keep you updated on the Balance of your addresses. 

If you don't like this or can't wait, you should use a light client. These are Bitcoin Wallets that connect to a server to read the blockchain and don't need to download anything.

Bitcoin are only useful to nerds, to the rest of humanity they are sadly too risky. This is not an issue that is truly *impossible* to remedy, but it is nonetheless a big issue, and it remains to be seen whether it will be solved.

Let's walk over the problems, shall we?

-Grampa install a new screensaver he found in his email inbox, from an email address he doesn't recognize. The next day he notices his Bitcoin have been transferred to an address he's unfamiliar with. His life savings are wiped out, and Grampa goes back to fiat currency.

-David has all his money stored on his computer. On a Friday night someone breaks into his home, starts up his computer, transfers all his Bitcoin to his own account, and leaves. The money is gone, and David can't pay for anything. David goes back to fiat currency.

-Stacey simply forgot her password, and frustrated goes back to using fiat currency.

If Bitcoin is going to work, you're going to have to figure out a way to make it safe for people other than men who have their hair in a ponytail and work in IT departments. The reason more people are not jumping in right now is because they realize they're too stupid for it, and they're also afraid of looking stupid to their peers if it doesn't work out. You have to be a nerd to understand it, and the one thing nerds are bad at is figuring out how to include non-nerds.

So, the solution *might* be online wallets, run by central institutes that figure out how to prevent idiots from losing their life savings, prohibits them from withdrawing or sending more than 1000 dollar worth of Bitcoin a day, calls them up when someone tries to withdraw large amounts, and if things *still* go wrong, is willing to pay out to people who lost their savings.

The problem is that online wallets have a bad reputation among Bitcoin users, because we only hear about them when they get hacked and everyone who stored more than 50 Bitcoin loses his money. These online wallets are not safe, and with so many scandals it will be incredibly difficult to convince Joe Sixpack to put his money on an online Bitcoin account that prevents him from sending 50 Bitcoin to Satoshidice when he's drunk again.

Hence, my question to you is: What should be done about this? Can this issue be remedied? Bitcoin would not be the first time a good idea fails to work out because it's too difficult for normal humans to use.",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,1365358046.0,,,True,t3_1bupy9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bupy9/problem_bitcoin_is_not_idiotproof/,

Gox and have never purchased bitcoins through either one. Seems like everyone's badmouthing CoinLab this morning for filing a lawsuit against Mt. Gox. Maybe I can provide some perspective.

First, it's just a lawsuit. Thousands are filed every day. Breathe. From the complaint, it looks like CoinLab had an agreement with Mt. Gox. CoinLab probably paid a pretty penny (er, satoshi) for that agreement. CoinLab is now alleging that Mt. Gox is not holding up its end of the bargain. What would you do in this situation?

Second, I see this as a positive sign for bitcoin. People are willing to sue the fuck out of each other (and hire Susman Godfrey--great lawyers, not cheap) over this little digital currency thingy. This isn't some shitstain lawyer vomiting on paper and filing in federal court just to get a nuisance settlement. The complaint is very well done. It's clear they put a lot of time into it.

Third, don't believe everything you read in the complaint. There are two sides to every story. Wait for Mt. Gox to respond by filing an answer or a motion to dismiss. Anyone can file a lawsuit claiming damages of any amount of money. $75 million? I've worked on a case alleging hundreds of *trillions* in damages.

Bitcoin, at its heart, is an agreement. As users of bitcoins, we have agreed to the protocols that have been given for mining, distribution, transacting, tracking, and validating. It's for this reason I propose that we use the latin word 'concordia', meaning agreement, as the way to describe bitcoin apart from traditional fiat currencies.

As a nice addition, 'concordia' also means 'harmony' and that is how I feel about bitcoin: we are creating an economic harmony.",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,False,,,True,t3_1brszi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1brszi/bitcoin_is_a_concordia_currency/,

Also, my initial concern that bitfloor had been hacked is now gone since the email has proven to be legitimate. I have since withdrawn all of my BTC to my wallet and advise you all to do the same (as Roman has suggested as well). 

Take the above email message as the detailed reason for why bitfloor is suspending it's operations until further notice.

This has brought the country's economic activity to a standstill. Many companies have closed, the rest have cut wages and laid off staff, tight controls have been placed on cash withdrawals and checks take weeks to clear. Those that do have cash spend as little as possible right now, contributing to the downturn. The general mood is a feeling of waking up and finding that your house has been burgled by thieves during the night.

I've been a vocal proponent of bitcoin for quite some time now. Friends have been asking me a lot about bitcoin lately - how to buy them, how to use them, what's their value, who's behind it, etc. Given the current situation, bitcoin is looking like a very intriguing alternative to more and more Cypriots. I believe the time has never been better to push bitcoin into the mainstream here in Cyprus, but I need your help.

On May 25, I and some friends will organize the first Bitcoin Forum in Nicosia to inform the public and small business owners about Bitcoin and digital currencies in general. At this forum we're planning on asking participants to bring their laptops or smartphones so we can show them step by step how to download a wallet and then explain how to send and receive. Ideally, we would like to award each participant with 0.1 BTC to get started.

We will also have a discussion on possible business opportunites, such as creating a Cypriot bitcoin/cash exchange (since buying bitcoin through bank accounts is not an option for most), creating websites, smartphone apps and anything else related to promoting bitcoin.

We are still in the planning stages, so I would welcome any ideas you may have. Also, we would like to ask for donations to this cause. 

What do you say bitcoiners? Want to help make bitcoin the first currency choice in Cyprus? The conditions have never been better to make bitcoin a truly revolutionary currency in our beautiful island. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and will keep you updated over the coming days.

The bank now named Ploutos (Greek God of Wealth) and the card payment network named Pisti (Trust) are set to be launched within the next 6 months. We have established the management team to ensure the business is run in the most efficient manner possible.

I have launched a blog here www.blog.bit-banking.eu in the first post there is a PDF that gives a better overview of everything that we will be doing and how we shall overcome the obstacles we will face in getting the Cypriot people to use our services.

Constructive feedback is appreciated and we already have several hundred merchants willing to accept our payment terminals and a large number of people that are waiting for our branches to open so they can move their funds away from their mattresses and into an account held with Ploutos Bank.

Please remember our target audience is not the existing Bitcoin community but mass adoption with the general public and merchants here in Cyprus.

EDIT - This has received some great feedback and lots of great questions (beyond our greatest expectations) and it turned into somewhat of a small AMA on the business, I will add some of the best onto a post on our blog for future reference. We are also going to provide a biography on each and every one of our core team in the not so distant future.

I got this new job last month and installing BitPay was litterally my own personal #1 priority since I started.

Now that talking about the current trading price has become extremely common (not that there is anything wrong with it) I just wanted to remind you that *Bitcoin will become whatever we talk about.*

If we treat Bitcoin as a trading stock, incoming newbies and first-timers will see it as such and, eventually, Bitcoin will become more of a stock than a currency. On the other hand, if we want to establish Bitcoin as a digital currency we must shift our focus a bit more from exchange price and trading to online merchants. 

**Online merchants are real heroes of the Bitcoin world.**

Without them no one would be using Bitcoin. Without them it wouldn't be a currency and without them, it wouldn't have the price it has today. Remember when the price grew whenever a popular website started accepting Bitcoin? That's exactly what we're looking for. 

So, *in conclusion*, let's welcome merchants with open arms and try to shift this subreddit's focus more towards that aspect. Let's keep emailing our favourite websites about Bitcoin support and offer shop owners a place to announce themselves to the community. (Not that we don't do this already, but this is just a reminder of its importance).

""recently received a full refund from BFL for an order I placed several months ago.

I know, I know, BFL claims that ""all sales are final"".  Well, there's ""final"", and then there's ""final""...

It took a month, but here's what worked for me:

-I sent an email to office@butterflylabs.com in which I politely requested a refund.

-About a week later, I received a reply from BFL denying my request.

-I filed a dispute with PayPal. In this dispute I noted that BFL failed to deliver, denied my refund request, and violated PayPal's Terms of Service for pre-order sales.

-PayPal closed my dispute the same day, stating that I was outside the 45-day window.

-I called PayPal's customer service and complained about my dispute being closed, and explained to PayPal exactly how BFL is violating the ToS.

-I sent an email to fraud@paypal.com in which I listed my transaction and dispute number, and explained how BFL is violating the ToS.

-A few days later, a PayPal Customer Solutions Supervisor called me on the phone. He had already spoken to BFL and assured me that BFL would be contacting me. I told him that I just wanted a refund, and explained to him how BFL is violating the ToS.

-I waited a week to give BFL plenty of time to contact me.  They didn't.

-I emailed the PayPal Customer Solutions Supervisor and told him that BFL had not contacted me. He seemed shocked. I wasn't. He told me that PayPal could take action against BFL if necessary.

-The PayPal Customer Solutions Supervisor escalated my dispute to the next level (whatever that is).  He told me that someone else would call.

-The next day I received a call from a guy named Bruce at BFL. He told me that since I had complained to PayPal, BFL was placing my order ""under review"" and taking it out of the queue. From his tone, I got the impression that Bruce thought this would bother me. I told him that I didn't need a review, I just wanted my money back. He wouldn't give me a firm answer and just kept repeating that they were placing my order ""under review"" and taking it out of the queue. I even asked if this review would take a day, week, month, or year. No answer, just the same ""under review"" statement.

-Within 5 minutes of BFL's call, an Account Representative from PayPal called. I told her about the strange conversation with Bruce. She said that she would contact BFL again.

-My payment to BFL was refunded to my PayPal account the next business day.

IMHO, this is the bottom line:

BFL needs PayPal. If you want your money back, complain to PayPal and don't give up.""

 We have had to disable ordering for the rest of this afternoon.  We have reached our limit for daily orders already!  We received **hundreds** of orders since we launched at Midnight last night, and it adds up!  As we grow, we will have more and more funds available to place your orders for you, but right now a few hundred orders has us squeezing them out.  We have interest already from some people who may be able to immediately open Bitspend up to process many more orders daily so we hope that happens soon.  If you placed an order already, we will be processing it today - do not worry!  As always, email us at support@bitspend.net with any questions or concerns you have

[**/EDIT 4**]


Hey guys 

We are [Bitspend.net](https://bitspend.net), a new start-up which allows you to order anything from any website(legal and non-living!), and pay for it using your Bitcoins.  The how is simple, you place your order with us by giving us the URL of the item(s) you want.  We send you an invoice and ask for your shipping details.  Once you've paid in Bitcoins, we place your order for you just as if you would have ordered it yourself.  The order is placed based on the URL and details you give us, and shipped directly to you which is why we ask for your shipping details.

For those of you who are as privacy-minded as we are, please have a look at our cut and dry privacy policy on the site.

We were planning on allowing Anonymous payments using Blockchain.info, but since it is down indefinitely we cannot.  However, we will make use of split-payments for those of you who want to make sure that your order is not traced to your Bitcoins.  Since we will be accepting Bitcoins from numerous addresses, and ordering using our accounts on the chosen websites of your products - there is really no definitive way to tie a Bitcoin payment to an order we place, especially if multiple split-payments are made.   Again, this option is only for those of you who want another layer of privacy.  For the rest of you, read our privacy policy regarding your data.

We plan on accommodating orders up to $5,000 in a couple months, and up to $1,000 in a few weeks.  For now, while we iron out our processes, we will be in an open beta and will allow orders up to $100.  We will accept orders above $100 on a case by case basis, just email us at orders@bitspend.net and we will happily help you.

Our goal is to provide the absolute best customer service possible.  In an effort to do that, we will have live phone support for all orders over $100, as well as chat and email support for all orders under.  We also have someone who will be monitoring our twitter @bitspendsupport, /r/bitspend, and any forum accounts to answer any and every question possible. 

The end goal of this and the Bitcoin community is to have all retailers online accept bitcoin - however that is not likely to happen at your larger companies for years if ever.  We plan to bridge that gap for as long as needed, and provide you a way to order anything online you want using your Biotcoins.

We know a lot of trust is needed in a business like ours - the guys over a pizzaforcoins.com have helped pave the way for honest start-ups to provide services letting you buy things with Bitcoins you cant otherwise.  In an effort to be as transparent as possible, in the next few weeks we will be moving into new offices in South FL where we live, and our office address will be listed.  We invite any of you to stop by and see for yourself, we are not a disappearing scam, but instead we are in it for the long-haul and have a few surprises coming in the months ahead that we hope will shake up the Bitcoin marketplace everywhere.

&gt; You guys seem like a really cool startup and the implications you have for bitcoin - the ability to buy anything online, even if indirectly - are amazing. I look forward to watching BitSpend grow and develop! - [d9-thc](/u/d9-thc)

This is exactly the type of outlook we were hoping we would be embraced with when we announced our service to the Bitcoin community.  We hope to help Bitcoin grow in popularity and legitimacy by making it easier for people to use on the sites they frequent normally.  We have some super-secret-airforce-one-undergound-bunker-of-aliens type stuff planned for the next 6 months, some additions to our service for both consumers AND retailers... stay tuned :) 


[**edit 2:  wtf time is it?**] it's 6AM and we havent slept yet!!  We will be back online around noon and we promise to answer and more questions, concerns, comments, and professions of love as soon as we get back(someone will begin processing overnight orders much earlier).  

[**edit 3:  Hours**] For those who have messaged and asked, and those wondering.  As of right now, we are processing orders from 10am - Midnight EST.  Orders made overnight and in the morning before then, will be processed in the order they came in.  We promise to get through them as fast as we can, while still maintaining a high level of customer support and interaction.

[**edit 4: Logo**]  Yeah, we know.  We are currently in the process of fixing up the asthetics, branding, etc., of the site and will have it done in the coming days.   We initially wanted to use The Bitmonk, as our own little mascot.. but things dont always work out the way you planned so he may need to be killed off.

In light of the recent Coinlab vs. MtGox debacle, it is becoming increasingly clear that having a member of the BTC Foundation involved in such a sordid affair is both bad for bitcoin and the foundation, and I therefore request that the foundation seriously consider the implications this has for Peter Vessenes' position as a key member on the board.


The fact that Mark was not even made aware of a pending lawsuit just goes to highlight the lack of trust and camaraderie between key board members and underscores the need for a serious (re)examination of personnel. 


It is, frankly, laughable that 1 of the 5 core board members is suing a fellow member in a matter that should have been dealt with behind closed doors; in a manner more befitting of men that are supposed to embody the core principles of bitcoin - a project whose ultimate goals are much greater than the pursuit of short-term profit margins, self-interest and petty intra-company bureaucracy.  


The foundation cites in its mission statement that they are committed to protecting bitcoin in an open and non-political environment.  And yet the actions of Peter show a flagrant disregard for these principles.  These decisions have neither helped protect bitcoin, nor were they open and non-political.  **It is clear that having the Coinlab CEO as an executive on the board does nothing but undermine the foundation**, the bitcoin community and other members within the foundation who remain true to the original goals set forth.  


**How can the community at large have any faith that these goals will be pursued in an open and transparent manner when members within the organisation are acting with impunity on behalf of special interest groups (such as the VC's that pull the strings at Coinlab)?**


Here is a quote from Peter you can find on the foundation website:


*""There’s a lot to love in Bitcoin-land, and a lot to be concerned about, too. There are botnet operators, hackers, and ponzi-scheme runners floating around our space. We occasionally hear threatening statements from government representatives that don’t seem to understand the law, much less how great Bitcoins are for the world.""*


After this latest sordid affair, perhaps we should be adding ""Legal threats from aggressive bitcoin start-ups"" to the list of things to be concerned about.

1367598080.0,268,self.Bitcoin,1dmjyg,Bitcoin from a banker prospective; a serious discussion and solutions,bitfan2013,322,54,293,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1dmjyg/bitcoin_from_a_banker_prospective_a_serious/,"Let me know your opinion, it's your Bitcoin!

First I think Bitcoin is a great concept that is sorely needed in today’s Global – Fast moving internet economy. I am personally a true fan of Bitcoin of its openness and transparency. My family and I sit on the board of directors of 4 small – medium sized private banks. Over the past couple of months as the big hoopla over Bitcoin has garnered worldwide media attention, I decided to bring up the Bitcoin concept up for discussion. 

I know that Bitcoiners everywhere believe that the Banks are scared of Bitcoin and are out to crush it; however, nothing could be further from the truth. Bankers are businessmen and run the Bank as a business and as any other business with profits being the goal while providing services for a fee to their customer’s base. The recent shutdown of accounts related to Bitcoin exchanges were not caused by the Banks not wanting competition from Bitcoin as an alternative, but by the burdensome regulation imposed by mostly western Governments that we all elected and put in place. A Bank wants to simply take your money, and provide credit to others to use your money to fund their home, car, business, etc… there is no big mystery or conspiracy behind it. They just don’t want to get fined by not complying with the AML/KYC bylaws.

HSBC was recently fined $1.9 Billion just for that. Now maybe HSBC as one of the world largest banks can handle a $1.9 Billion fine, but most banks would collapse.
Bitcoin solves many issues on a global scale providing the ability to move “currency” for almost no fees, everywhere in seconds, don’t you think that’s a Bankers wet dream not being tied to the slow moving Swift system where everyone and their mother takes a cut from a simple wire. It’s not even worth it to wire anything less than $1000 due to those high fees. So people go to WU (Still expansive compared to Bitcoin) and send money that way bypassing the Banks. 

I would personally love to setup a Virtual Exchange account in one of our banks and have recently discussed that options with the Board of Directors, but the same thing that happened to bitfloor and Bitcoin-24 would eventually happen to this account. Our bank will need to shut it down due to the influx of unaccounted funds. If the bank can’t have a nice and neat paper trail of the funds then they will not be in compliance with AML/KYC and face fines. So their quickest solution is to freeze the account and refund the money a.s.a.p. They can’t take the risk of fines that these relatively small account of the exchange would cost the bank and their other customers and shareholders. 

So let’s cut the banks a break and really dive down to the core issue that Bitcoin is facing: Fiat to Bitcoin and back to Fiat. A real Fiat Bank from scratch should be setup by Bitcoin users, miners, merchants and developers for the purpose of doing business in Bitcoin and exclusively to Virtual Currencies. That way we eliminate the risk of your everyday bank customer from being exposed to the Bitcoin Bank. The Bank will comply with all AML/KYC regulations and open individual and corporate accounts to customers separately, not just one exchange account as we have today.  If there is an issue with one account, only that account is dealt with not freezing all other accounts. Any account holder would transfer funds from their existing Bank account to their Bitcoin bank personal account.  An escrow exchange clearing account can be setup to transfer funds in and out internally within the bank for executed trades between buyers and sellers of Bitcoin on the exchange open market.  So your money will be in your personal private account and not in a here today gone tomorrow exchange account that has thousands of exchange customers funds tied up together with your money.

So if the Bitcoin community chooses to look at Bitcoin as a long term solution and not as a quick get rich scheme then the only viable long term solution for the success of Bitcoin is for members to join forces and form the First true Bitcoin-Fiat Bank. Serious replies only.

I would recommend opening a Bank in one of the few Bank Friendly nations like Panama. You could still receive a Banking license for a $3 Million Security Deposit. It requires Class B license to be authorized to do business with clients from all over the world, not including Panama.

        
The Idea of this thread is to measure the community's reaction and feedback to a such a proposal, would there be support or opposition to forming a Community Non For Profit Bank that exclusively caters to the Virtual Currency economy?

Just Revised:
We could use the open Bitcoin idea, where all Bank account holders can view all other account numbers funds available and transactions, but without the Account's Holder's name.. may be an interesting new open concept in Banking. What do you think?

TLDR: Reposted from user:doyourduty below:

1) OP comes from a family of bankers

2) Banks aren't afraid of bitcoin, they love the idea of it. The KYC/AML laws are the problem.

3) Too many unaccounted for funds can cause a huge penalty

4) Main problem is bitcoin&lt;--&gt;fiat

5) OP's Solution: An international bitcoin bank in panama where fraudulent activity within a specific account could be dealt with individually instead of screwing everyone (i.e. bitfloor, bitcoin-24)

6) A personal bank account, with online access would be opened in your name, a debit/visa/mc would be issued
and you and only you would have control and access to this account

7) Internal bank exchange from BTC to your currency would be performed instantly with other bank account holders though an escrow instant account to provide anonymity. 

8) The Bank will act as any other bank as far as Fiat is concerned but will also provide you with the option to convert your Currency into BTC at any time from multiple open exchanges that will open accounts with the bank.

We’ve received a number of escalations regarding Bitcoin merchants using PayPal. Any merchant seeking to sell or buy Bitcoins with PayPal is operating as a financial exchange. Please be aware that Financial Exchange merchants are prohibited unless pre-approved by PayPal. This process involves getting VP approvals from both Risk and Compliance, and only licensed financial institutions are considered.

Merchant contacts

If we receive contacts on Bitcoin sales, instead of escalating further, kindly advise customers that they need to be licensed financial institutions to be considered for approval. However, there are some acceptable cases, as outlined below.

Acceptable Bitcoin business models for PayPal

Merchants with a business model that is related to Bitcoin but does not sell Bitcoins may be acceptable. For example:
Merchants offering Bitcoin education packages Merchants selling computer hardware designed specifically for mining Bitcoins. In this case, kindly ensure that the merchant isn’t pre-selling and actually has the equipment ready to deliver.

1364538580.0,265,self.Bitcoin,1b89wm,I just got robbed blind of bitcoins - in person. I'm feeling like I've lost trust in the usability of the currency and looking for advice.,Nyxian,376,111,397,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b89wm/i_just_got_robbed_blind_of_bitcoins_in_person_im/,"Going to keep it short and simple. I live in a major metropolitan city, and do a lot of business of craigslist. Meet in person, public location, inspect the item, hand cash and be on my way. I'm sure I have 25+ transactions, never been scammed.

Today, I saw someone include just as a footnote ""I also accept bitcoins"". Not ""I only accept bitcoins"" or ""plz send bitcoins i mail"" just a little footnote that they are fine with it.

Contacted, mentioned purchasing in cash, that was fine, and at the end decided to do it in bitcoins. Brought my laptop, public wifi, took a seat at a McDonalds. Inspected the headphones - Perfect condition, as described, everything was looking good. 


He hands me a paper cutout with a wallet address, I key it into blockchain, he is looking at the address on screen. I confirm the price (80 USD, was .8xxbtc), he says good, I hit send, the little blockchain *beep* plays over the speakers.

**He casually stands up, has the headphones, and walks away**. I stand up pretty quick, and shout after to him, accusing him of theft. He says a quick comment around the lines of ""If you can't pay the price don't waste my time, I said $80"" and walks out. 

I contemplate chasing after him, calling the police, or fuck maybe getting some public attention, then I realized I didn't have a leg to stand on.

Cameras would show a guy sitting down at a table, showing me headphones, me inspecting them, then playing on a computer for a bit, with him walking off. I attempt to accuse him of theft, he probably didn't even have $80 in his wallet, nothing would show me handing him cash, and the worst part, as I sat there with a mixture of adrenaline, rage and frustration - is that It was impossible for me to get that money back.

Can you imagine trying to talk to the police about this? *So yeah officer, I sent him bitcoins, a virtually currency for this craigslist transaction, and then he walks off* - Sir, do you have any proof of this? *Well, he gave me this address of random letters, but I swear it's his, but it isn't there anymore, it's gone to a mixing service where it gets pu-*

You get the point. I have a decently hard time explaining bitcoins to my eager, willing to learn friends. I can't imagine trying to explain it to an officer who thinks I just tried to give someone WoW gold for headphones.

So, is there any safety precaution out there I didn't take, or should you just keep BTC and Craigslist as far apart as possible?

Thanks for reading the rant. Sorry for the wall of text. I guess I just kinda needed to get it out there.

**EDIT: First off - Thank you [GSpotAssassin](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b89wm/i_just_got_robbed_blind_of_bitcoins_in_person_im/c94lxf5). Seriously awesome guy right there**

Due to the overwhelming consensus that I should *do something*, and I agree, **I will be filing a police report** later today or early tomorrow morning. I'll be providing them with all of the information I have, BTC address, email, phone number, description of him, time we met, everything I can think of.

With that said, as nice as the vigilant offers are, I'm not going to release the address, email, or phone number. I know, the pitchforks are raised, but I think it's for the best:

1) I do know 100% that it was a mixer address and nothing else. Unless you are in control of the mixing service, there is nothing you can do.

2) The email appears to be a throwaway or unused, searching for the exact address, or slight permutations of such came up with nothing useful. 

3) Phone number. My best bet for a police report, hopefully it is an actual *phone* and not just a online service.

With that said, I am going to do my best, provide all of the info to police and see where it goes. Being $80 of value, it's probably going to be overlooked, but hopefully it might be used later down the line, if he is a perpetual scammer.

*****
In regards to future transactions, I'm still fine working with BTC. Seriously - It didn't ruin it for me. However, I'm going to be taking a number of the suggested precautions in here before working with it again. It appears the best bet is a small written contract, and good video proof during the actual transaction. At least if they *do* run or claim I didn't pay, I have blockchain verifying a contract, with video proof of them. 

Hell, if I had a camera in his face, I doubt this would have happened at all.

I first heard about bitcoin late 2010-early 2011 from a friend and thought it'd be worth spending a few minutes to set up profiles on a few of these obscure bitcoin-tipping sites that were around at the time (most of them are long gone). In those days I was super-broke and struggling to recover after trying to go in full-time for music alone...of course I didn't put any hope into this but thought I'd support the idea because I liked the decentralized way of doing things. As time went on, a handful of people discovered my music and tipped me small amounts. I kept them and didn't touch it - Bitcoin-Qt took nearly a day to sync 1.5 years of backlog since I last ran it. 

As of today, these few miniscule tips are already worth more than ALL my combined sales percentages from iTunes, Amazon, Beatport, physical sales etc. ever delivered!! and that's considering I've had a best selling release on a small but respected record label.

This has really made me think. I guess what I'm trying to say - don't underestimate the idea behind Bitcoin as a system! It could make a difference of an order of magnitude, especially for people that are squeezed hard by the way of the world today. In the long run, this low-friction environment enabling supporters to easily transfer a few cents worth can set them up for a bit better future. It's like planting trees, but much less effort.

For myself, I'm still keeping those early tips and investing a bit in the system. Kudos to everyone for trying to make this happen. Maybe it's possible to change things and outsmart these old trolls running the show.

For example, more than 100 million people on the social platform QQ have used the Q coin for more than 10 years. And after China’s state-run China Central Television, or CCTV, ran a half-hour-long documentary on bitcoins, downloads of apps for processing and “mining” bitcoins soared in the world’s second largest economy.

Bitcoin, long the plaything of the Western ubernerd, now appears poised to grow substantially in China and other markets, like the euro zone, where government meddling in native currency valuations has left many distrustful of the money in their bank accounts.

Americans don’t have this problem -- yet. And that may be a problem in itself. According to bitcoin proponents, if the U.S. tries to ignore the nascent currency, writing it off as a financial fad with less value than the seemingly stable dollar, Americans risk ceding to the Chinese and others control of the future of what could be the most disruptive force in monetary exchanges since the credit card. In turn, the dollar and the ability of the U.S. to navigate global currency conflicts could be seriously weakened.

“Here’s the bottom line: Bitcoin has much higher popularity outside the U.S. and much higher potential outside the U.S.,” observed Andreas M. Antonopoulos of the Bitcoin Foundation. “If you go to an American and say, ‘Hey, there’s this new thing, bitcoin,’ they say, ‘Well, what’s wrong with the dollar?’ That question is different in other countries.”

Bitcoins are a finite, Web-based currency created in 2009 by a group of hackers working under the nom-de-Internet Satoshi Nakamoto. Exactly 10,952,975 bitcoins are in circulation, all of which have been purchased on exchange networks or mined. The currency is mined using software that processes transactions on the bitcoin network, adding groups of transactions, called blocks, to the chain. Miners are paid about 25 bitcoins per block. That digital money can then be used to purchase a variety of goods online, from legitimate software to heroin on the infamous virtual black-market Silk Road.

Bitcoin surged in value to $266 last month, thrusting the currency into the mainstream spotlight as investment poured in from sources as diverse as the hapless Brothers Winklevoss (of Facebook infamy) and Union Capital Ventures principal Fred Wilson (an early investor in Zynga, Twitter, and Kickstarter). Suddenly, everyone was talking about buying bitcoins. But the bubble burst in late April, and in the U.S. at least, bitcoin faded from the news. That was not the case in China, where Antonopoulos said downloads of bitcoin clients have eclipsed those in the U.S.

Bitcoins are mined in several steps. After downloading a bitcoin client, such as Coinbase (which serves as a wallet in which to store the bits of code that constitute the digital money), miners often join pools where they share computing power to decode algorithms in which bitcoins are hidden. The concept of bitcoins and bitcoin mining is cryptic for many people, even some otherwise forward-thinking American investors. The irony is that, for now, American startups are leading the bitcoin charge, and the U.S. government was the first to issue guidance on using the currency as payment -- a seemingly tacit recognition of bitcoin’s validity as legal tender.

**Why China Poses A Threat**

Feng Li, the IDG partner who chose to fund Coinbase, said the Chinese have yearned for access to a virtual currency since the central government cracked down on the use of Q coins.

Q coins were introduced in March 2002 by Tencent Holdings Ltd. (HKG:0700), the parent company of the country’s most popular instant-messaging service, QQ , and they currently average an annual transaction value of more than 1 billion yuan ($163 million). That value is growing at about 15 to 25 percent each year.

Q coins, purchased with yuan, are predominantly used to buy virtual products and services in QQ and its related online games and social media. Originally, Tencent regulations prevented Q coins from being traded between users or converted back to yuan, but allowed users to trade points and purchase Q coins with their game accounts, then use the black market to convert them into cash. That caused concerns at the People’s Bank of China, China’s central bank. In January 2007, converting game points to Q coins was banned, and Tencent reiterated that Q coins constitute a product, not a currency, which seemed to satisfy the concerns.

“There has already been proof with the Q coin,” Feng said of the Chinese likeliness to start using bitcoin. “It’s been very well circulated and very well adopted.”

Already, shops on Taobao -- the Chinese equivalent to eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), owned by Alibaba.com Ltd. (HKG:1688) -- accept bitcoins as payment for goods, as does the similar service, Tencent’s PaiPai.com.

The Chinese are embracing bitcoins in other ways. The first bitcoin fund began to raise money in June, with the goal of raising 20 million yuan. The fund’s investment threshold is 10,000 yuan, and it will mature in four years.

Q coin’s popularity isn’t the only reason bitcoin has appeal in China. As it turns out, China is the perfect place for bitcoin mining. While much of the developed world is well into the transition from personal computers to mobile devices, China’s PC market is still thriving, which provides the necessary computing power to run a successful business converting electricity into mined coins. Price caps on electricity already create wasteful use of energy in China, so running a code-crunching computer for hours on end isn’t as costly an investment as it would be in the U.S. And so-called “gold-mining” or “gold-farming” businesses already exist in China’s cybersphere. None of that will come as a surprise to any “World of Warcraft” player: Gamers in Chinese urban sweatshops are known to sit in front of glowing blue screens for hours, slaughtering players in the game for their spoils or mining gold deposits found in the sprawling milieu of Blizzard Entertainment’s international blockbuster. Those treasures are then sold to players in the game for real money.

China has a heavily controlled currency, which also makes bitcoin attractive.  

“The more controlled the currency is, the harder the transactions are, the more friction there is in the national currency, the more appealing the coin is,” Antonopoulos said, noted that the most appealing place to use bitcoin would be a country whose economy is a veritable train wreck -- like Zimbabwe, except that the southern African nation lacks the necessary technology. “I would say China is perfect,” he said. “It’s got the penetration, it’s got the smartphones, it’s got the Internet and the people are familiar with virtual currencies. And, it’s got the not-as-appealing national currency.”

**Regulation In The U.S.**

Guidance issued in March by the U.S. Treasury Department said that companies issuing or exchanging online cash, including bitcoin, would be subject to the same scrutiny as traditional firms such as the Western Union Co. (NYSE:WU) to prevent money laundering.

Less than two months later, the Department of Homeland Security proved that edict had teeth.

Federal officials obtained a warrant Tuesday to seize an account tied to Mt.Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange company that handles about 80 percent of all bitcoin trades. Authorities accused Mt.Gox’s U.S. subsidiary, Mutum Sigillum LLC, of failing to register as a money-services company with the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. An account held by the online-payments firm Dwolla was subsequently seized.

Many feared the warrant execution could cast a chill over the bitcoin industry as a sector centered on a borderless, decentralized money came under the scrutiny of the federal government.

That proved not to be the case, Coinbase’s Ehrsam said. “For bitcoin to go mainstream, or as it goes mainstream, it will be used in a higher and higher amount of transactions,” he said, adding that Coinbase is registered as a money-services firm. “There’s no way there will be all this money flowing through an unregulated system.”

Chris Larsen -- the CEO of OpenCoin, a fellow San Francisco-based payment platform that processes most national currencies as well as bitcoin and its own virtual cash, Ripple -- agreed. “They definitely are regulating them, [and] we actually think that’s a really good thing for the industry,” he told IBTimes. “I thought the guidance was a good idea. One of the things the guidelines seem to make clear for the first time is that a virtual currency could be used for goods and services.”

**The Price Of Regulation**

But such regulation is a slippery slope, said Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

Perhaps it begins with measures to prevent money-laundering, he said. But what measures would the government take to prevent the untraceable currency from being used for child pornography or human trafficking?

“Bitcoin has the potential to be a disruptive technology that would be beneficial to the economy, and we don’t want to kill off that potential to get at the other potential for bad stuff,” he observed. Brito, who plans to speak next month at a conference on virtual currencies organized by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, added: “We’re already the first country to enforce money-laundering laws against bitcoin. But the U.S. would be shooting itself in the foot if it went too far [with regulations] and either outlawed bitcoin or made the legal guidelines impossible to comply with.”

**Will China Step In?**

So far, Chinese bitcoin merchants have little to fear. For many, the CCTV segment on bitcoin seemed to be a signal from Beijing, which heavily controls the channel’s content, that the currency is worth exploring.

Some of those interviewed speculated that the Communist Party wants to see bitcoin stockpiled in China, allowing the government to invest in it if, or when, the dollar is shaken from its perch as the world’s reserve currency.

It remains to be seen whether -- or, more likely, when -- China will intervene in the trade of bitcoin in its own economy. But for the U.S. to experience widespread adoption of the currency, which is considered a necessary step for gaining a grasp on the bitcoin market, limited government control will have to allow the money, like the Internet that birthed it, to develop organically.

I've spent almost ~~300~~ 350BTC on rewards, which mean that almost ~~$6000~~ $7000 went to the organizations that help others. Plus we probably made enough noise for some of them to at least check what exactly bitcoins are. And, if you ask me, even if one's person life gets a little better or at least one of those foundations starts accepting btc for donations, then it was totally worth it! Hopefully this won't be the last time that we spare some coins to make the world a little brighter. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did!

ps: if i forgot or omitted you, or did wrong by you by any means do not hesitate to message me, i'm sure we'll figure something out:)
ps2: whoever bought me reddit gold: thanks! while i can see absolutely no difference at all, it looks nice next to my name at least. i really hope you paid in btc :)!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



right now 1btc~=$35, so i think it's a fair deal. here's what you have to do to participate:

1) you must donate to any charity of your choice. by this i mean any known, reputable organization that actually helps people (as in medical aid, education or feeding the hungry, you get the drift. no political/social movements types of orgs. please comment/msg me if in doubt.)

2) you ~~must~~ should send a short message to the said charity, explaining what btcs are and why they should consider accepting them as a donation. extra karma for those of you who actually succeed.

3) you must send me a verifiable receipt - i reserve the right to contact the organization you donated to before i send you any bitcoins. don't get me wrong, i believe most of you are really charming, kind, caring people, but there is no shortage of thieves and scammers, and i don't want to make their day.

4) your receipt WITH ALL YOUR PERSONAL INFO BLACKED OUT will be posted in the comments along with txid of your reward; hopefully this get enough momentum to actually make some impact in and outside of the btc community, and i don't want any idiots crying ""omg is liek totaly a SCAMM!!11"" and whatnot

... and that's it. let's get it going :) imho there's no better way to promote bitcoins than to share some.


ps: before anyone asks

- there is a limit of 5 btc per person, i'd like to see as much people involved in this as possible
- i'm a very privacy oriented person, none of your personal info will be shared with any 3rd part; i just need the receipt to stop any potential scammers. after the verification the original receipt will be deleted, and only the copy without ANY identifiable info will be posted in the comments. more info/pgp available on request
- max 100 btc to give away, i don't want to go broke over this. if you would like to tip in please send me a message
- i've been quite busy lately, so please bear in mind it might take me up to 2 days before sending btc, if you can't wait that long please don't take part.
- for creditability i can send few btc upfront ONLY to the reputable members of the community who declare they willingness to participate


now, /r/bitcoin, let's show the world that we care :)


EDIT: you people are FUCKING AWESOME! didn't expect it to escalate so quickly. i'm currently waiting for bitcoins to confirm on my bitcointip account*, and trying to verify any proofs i got on pm in the meantime.
* - funny story time: if an e-wallet service charge some % of the funds you keep with them for the transactions fees, that doesn't necessarily mean any fees will get included with outgoing transactions. go figure. they learn from bankers pretty quickly, eh


EDIT2: ugh 5 confirmations, so i'll start tipping any minute now. still overwhelmed by the response o_O quick few words:

- please don't take it personally if ask you for a receipt (or an uncesored version of one)! i just want to be as sure as possible that btc go to people who actually cared and donated!

- bitcointip bot is actually very easy to use. once tipped, you'll have a wallet created automatically for you. you'll also get a pm with your address and (i think) basic commands. you could always send 'help' to /u/bitcointip , visit /r/bitcointip , check out [quick start guide](http://imgur.com/kvGk6) or even ask here if you feel lost. if you fall in love with it as i did, make sure to send some cryptolove in author's direction

- i'm going through the pms in the order i received them, so please be patient. if significant amount of time passes and you're still omitted, please pm me again

EDIT3: WOW you guys mean business. since i'm pretty close to reaching 100 btc and i'm just about 1/3 through my inbox, i'm going to throw extra 150 btc to the mix. 

!!! BUT !!!

when this limit (overall 250 btc) is reached i will have to stop. SO IF YOU WANT TO DONATE ONLY IF YOU ARE GETTING BTC IN RETURN PLEASE, PLEASE wait some time until i go through all the donations made already an state how much btc i've got left to give away (if any)

SERIOUSLY people, i love your enthusiasm and all but if i run out of coins before i get to your donation in my inbox you will NOT be getting btcs, just so we're clear. &gt;50btc left


EDIT4: aaaand it seems that i'm out. it's been a one crazy ride i'm keeping few btc locked for people who donated earlier but didn't send a receipt (or send a one lacking details). if they don't answer in a while i'm going to send the remaining btc to any not rewarded donations in order of their receipts incoming in my inbox [damn i don't know how to english :/]. for those few people who donated and didn't make it on the btc train, well, a) you have been warned and b) you've done a good deed so don't beat yourself over it :). i'll be posting some sort of summary and maybe few 'last words' in a bit.",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,1362499050.0,,,True,t3_19oiht,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/19oiht/rbitcoin_lets_share_with_those_in_need_for_every/,

If everyone here on reddit can brainstorm and try to come up with a more convenient way to get this done then that will help this currency succeed. Later I will try to come up with some different ideas but I just thought I may post this before I have to leave work.

Another thing I would recommend doing is informing everyone you know about this currency, because everyone at my work which is at a tech store had no clue what bitcoins are, I know its pretty sad.

I use the blockchain.info wallet service to manage that address.  My password was a random 18 character password with punctuation, upper/lower case etc. I had two-factor authentication with Google Authenticator turned on and a second password on the account that was a random 8 characters.

I had logged into the account with my laptop at home to send a small transaction of 0.937 bitcoins half an hour earlier.  I haven't left the house since so no one has had access to my laptop.  I'm on WPA2 secured wifi but not using a VPN.  Laptop is running Ubuntu.  I also have the blockchain.info app on my phone.  It doesn't use the 2-factor authentication or the main password but does prompt for the second password.

**Update:** As pointed out by metavox in the comments the same transaction that emptied my main vanity address that I had loaded into blockchain.info also stole from two other addresses, one of which I had sent 1 BTC to on Sept 5th 2012.  I've worked out that I was attending a local bitcoin meetup in Vancouver at that time and my best guess is that I owned 1PcXspQbZWxUkS9bHcbgMUsb8HsUzP5noT in some other wallet that I was testing/demoing at the time and had also loaded my vanity address into.  I'm not certain if that's for sure the case or what wallet software it might've been since I've experimented with so many of them, but it seems likely that my blockchain.info account wasn't the one that was compromised since the 1PcXspQbZWxUkS9bHcbgMUsb8HsUzP5noT address wasn't loaded in there and I did have other archived addresses in the blockchain wallet with some BTC left in them that wasn't stolen.",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,1367879464.0,,,True,t3_1czrua,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1czrua/just_lost_160_btc_from_address_managed_with/,

So here's the deal, I will integrate bitcoin payments in your website **FREE** of charge. There are only a few conditions:


* I will only work with bitcoin, if you need some other work done on the website I will gladly do it.... at my usual rate, maybe a discount for a fellow btc user ;) )

They stated that this type of product does not fit their ""risk profile"". I asked them for clarification and the lady seemed to think I was selling bitcoins. I'm selling ASICMINER USB Block Erupters. I told her that I have the product in hand and tested and she said it did not matter. 

She said that listing ANYTHING related to bitcoins violates their terms of service at this time. 

I then had all of my outstanding auctions deleted, even though I have recently sold several usb miners. They are not rescinding the auctions but I am doubtful they will let me list again. 

Has anyone else had this issue? Are there any alternative places I can sell this hardware?

It doesn't matter how trustworthy these people seem or how much ""reputation"" they have, you have literally NO security when selling your coins through paypal. If the buyer files a chargeback, no matter how much proof you think you have you WILL lose your case.

I personally sold 2 BTC to a Reddit user who seemed exceedingly trustworthy, he had a reputation in this subreddit AND a solid reputation as a lender in /r/loans. He sent his payments, I sent the coins and he even had attached notes to his payments acknowledging receipt of his coins.

One month later he files 2 chargeback claims, both of which I lose despite my evidence of delivery, and he deletes his Reddit account and starts ignoring his emails.

So no matter how tempted you are to get a quick sale, don't bother risking your coins. The Bitcoin system is far to open to these sorts of scams due to it's non refundable nature.

It will not, as some have suggested, ban microtransactions. What the change amounts to:

* Removing the hardcoded fee requirements from the standard Bitcoin client. Miners will instead set their own minimum fees, and users will need to offer fees that most miners will accept if they hope to get their transaction accepted in a block quickly. This will prevent situations where the value of Bitcoin goes up quickly, but most clients are still using the old minimum fee, leading to a minimum transaction fee that is worth 7 cents USD.

* By default, nodes and miners will not relay or accept transactions with values less than 54.3 uBTC. This default can be changed, so no node or miner will be forced to use it. If another miner, that is not using 0.8.2 client, or has changed the default value, creates a block with transactions with values less than 54.3 uBTC, all miners will still accept that block.",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,False,,,True,t3_1drslh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1drslh/082_will_not_eliminate_microtransactions/,

That's cool. You probably don't like it. It's where the kids hang out and it's riddled with invasions of privacy. Where do you think our biggest opportunity is? Facebook. Now walk your happy ass over to that arrow and make it red.

**The Revolution:** Let's start the next bitcoin revolution on Reddit tonight. I'm about to plant a seed that will make bitcoin a reality for the world. The goal seems impossible, and I have difficulty conecptualizing how it will work - but it is the future, so stop fighting it.

Your job is to think about this. Tell people about it. Pastebin it, repost it, rephrase it, hack it, code it, share it, github it, develop it, then facebook it.


**What is it?** The concept is simple: Transparent integration of bitcoin onto each facebook page. Users send money to other users with the click of a button and no worries. When they ask more questions they follow a link to a simple explanation.

**What are the requirements?**

* The functionality is not dependent on facebook, but not directly in opposition to fb policies. Fully integrated with facebook, but not accessible by facebook hacking. Able to be accessed account through third party without giving facebook direct access. See bitcointip bot's private key export method.

* There is little or no dependence on a third party server. If code is pulled from a third party server it should be trusted and robust. Integration with a service like blockchain.info wallets or instawallet.org  are probably required - but preferrably with diversity and failover. (round robin?, user choice?)

* Viral - The functionality spreads from one user to another with little or no action required. Transactions default to public but may be privatized.

* simple - One or two clicks should do the trick.

* Should not require facebook user app permissions - but this may be necessary (?)

* Public - the entire framework should be posted publicly to github.


**Sounds impossible, right?** It does look like a big task. Pick a day, build a team, get some coffee and make this happen.

This was entirely my fault due to screwing up with my security, not anybody elses. I fucked this up due to not knowing how to set it up properly and was easy prey. I""m sorry to Mt.Gox for ever implying that they were responsible here. I left my original post as I don't want to cover up what I wrote, but I was wrong, and was totally at fault for this happening (aside from the thief obviously). I want to thank everyone who taught me how to be more secure, and I'll be back once I've done all the things you said.**  

So those of you who don't know me. I'm a nerdy girl who mines bitcoin/altcoins and is poor. A few weeks ago I decided I was going to camwhore for the bitcoin community on /r/girlsgonebitcoin in hopes of getting some tips and paying for my groceries. 

After a week, I realized that if I wanted to make any money with bitcoin, I needed to have some guts, and so I took my savings account money and went to a drugstore and sent cash to mtgox via zipzap/moneygram. The money was depositied fine into my account where it sat happily for weeks awaiting a good day to buy bitcoin. 

Having read horror stories, I installed 2 factor authentication via google authenticator tied to my cellphone on my gox account and all other accounts I have. I also keep my bitcoin wallet encrypted and stored in a non-typical directory inside a truecrypt container. I'm not a stupid girl. 

This morning I awoke to an email from Mt.Gox letting me know there had been a withdrawal on my account. While I logged in yesterday, I didn't withdraw anything. My account had been used to purchase a little over 4 bitcoin, emptying it completely, and then sent the bitcoin to a vanity address.

My bitcoin wallet address is the same address I have always used when camwhoring on r/girlsgonebitcoin. Feel free to examine it. The vast majority of the btc in that wallet came from two large deposit purchases of bitcoin via my own cash. Pretty much anything over 1btc incoming I bought in cash, and the smaller ones came from tips. Thus far I haven't seen anything wrong with my wallet. It seems safe and secure:  
https://blockchain.info/address/1669nJLncdiyuwRYmBfk4D6qF4Dibz7GjQ

The bitcoin address that was used to transfer the bitcoins out of my account was this taunting one (1 Lulz): 

https://blockchain.info/address/1LuLza3QfbXP3GcABCe86MYSAy9jDq3DRm

Gox gave me this message:

There has been a withdrawal from your Mt.Gox account:

Date: 2013-05-13 09:22:02 GMT

I immediately contacted them letting them know I did not authorize this transaction. They replied with this:

Hello,

Sorry for the inconvenience.Please change your email address password and Mt.Gox password immediately. Please do not use the same username and password on different services. You can use the Yubikey or Software Authentication on our Security Center to further secure your accounts.

Please file a police report in order for the police to investigate the case and make an effort to retrieve your funds. We will cooperate with the police authority in providing the necessary information for the investigation, but we are unable to reimburse any stolen funds.

Thanks,

I replied to them:

I have software authentication via google 2ndary authorization on my account already.I also have a unique password for GOX.

I got no reply, so I messaged again:

Well? Whats the story? My account should be secure, I'm behind the extra authentication and I have been verified. You're telling me that isnt enough?

They replied to me:

Hello,

Thank you for the email. I can see that the BTC has been bought for $480.05000 and withdrawn on Mon 13 May. I see that the withdrawal have already been processed. Kindly refer to the below link and process withdrawal can not traced or stopped.

 ~~I cannot fathom how this was possible unless my money was either stolen by an insider at gox, or someone managed to hijack my login instance/remote into my computer while I was logged into gox. The bitcoin is still sitting in the vanity wallet that it was transferred to. I plan on keeping an eye on it and seeing where it goes, but I doubt I'll ever see a satoshi of it again.~~

  
  
**TLDR**
  
  
~~In any case, someone managed to steal all my money from gox despite 2-factor authentication. Gox basically doesn't give a fuck. I will update this if they change their tune, but I somehow doubt they will help me.~~ 

~~Let my misery stand as a warning. There has been lots of talk lately on bitcointalk and other forums about money dissapearing from sites like mtgox, vicurex, and even wallets. I don't know what to advise beyond doing what we all thought to be sufficient, but take every possible precaution so you don't end up losing all your money like I did.~~

 
**Last Edit before bed: Somehow an API key was put onto my account and that was used to do the withdrawal. I do not know when this occurred. I never set one up and literally had no idea what it was until I was told to look for it.  If it was done prior to my 2FA it was done literally right after I made the account as it was empty for a week or two before I made the cash deposit. If it was done after, I probably was busted by some exploit. Some other commenters in the thread found unauthorized API keys with full access set up in their accounts, so I suggest everyone take a quick look at your gox/ect and be sure that there isn't anything unsavory that has slipped in before its too late. THANK YOU to everyone who gave me computer advice. I clearly have a lot more to learn, but when I come back, my computer will be far more secure, and I suspect will be dual booting linux and windows with all my bitcoin dealings on the linux side fully encrypted.**",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,1368564197.0,,,True,t3_1e9v0l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1e9v0l/psa_i_had_480_stolen_out_of_my_mtgox_account_this/,

CNN Interview
from ADMlNISTRATION sent 15 minutes ago
We are going to be featured on an upcoming article on CNN.com regarding our Bitcoin community :) CNN contacted us and asked for if a random panel compromised of /r/Bitcoin/ members who would be interested in being interviewed for the article! To talk about their experiences learning about Bitcoin, how they were introduced to Bitcoin, how Reddit is a source of Bitcoin news for them etc..
There's no fair way to choose who gets to be interviewed, so we've come up with a unique idea. We chose a random group of users (you're one of them since you're getting this message), and decided we will contact them directly to ask if they're up for it..
If you're interested in being interviewed, here are the steps:
1)You respond to this message with your email address that you can best be reached at 2)You make a single ""donation"" of 1 Bitcoin to our Operations Fund (running our site 24/7 is a significant financial toll for a small company like us) that we will greatly appreciate!
We then send you an email confirmation and will forward your email address to Adrien Nathan @ CNN (who is coordinating with us for the article) who will then get in touch with you from there.
Reddit Operations Fund Address: 1HZYBtEbPfZrgNTNB4rE18dBCHa5Q7pWN8
We figure that's the fairest way to select who to have interviewed for the article, since CNN was adamant that they wanted a small representative of bitcoin enthusiasts on Reddit.
If you're not interested, no worries! Please respond to us by Thursday afternoon and just say you're not, and we'll replace you with one of the alternates.
We do request you keep this to yourselves as we couldn't find a more fair way of selecting the interviews, and don't want to have to dig through a zillion messages from members of our /r/Bitcoin community. That and we gave CNN our word we'd be discrete about it!

He even offered to lend me a throwaway phone for the week. He met me later that day and gave me the phone, fully charged with minutes for the week.

The last few hours have been eventful, with a pretty well orchestrated DDoS. This DDoS was meant to induce panic selling, so they could buy up bitcoins at a lower price.

You're not going to help yourself by just staring at bitcoinity/mtgox/reddit etc. constantly pressing f5, spamming sell orders (in fact you're probably contributing to the lag).

So just take a break, have a bath/go for a walk/play some video games and come back later. If you invested correctly, you should have been aware of the potential for a loss and be able to handle it. Hold out for the long term, we have seen exponential growth over the past couple of weeks, and the current price is still higher than what it was a week or two ago.

Just my advice, 


peace


Edit: What we can take out of this situation is that we clearly need better exchanges that can handle large volumes of trading/traffic. We can't rely on Mt.Gox. We need to push for better quality, otherwise bitcoin cannot go on like this. Over an hour of trading lag is unacceptable, exchange sites that keep going down leaving us unable to trade our own currency is unacceptable.

It's taken me over a week of effort, but I've finally completed uploading all 61 of my 'Bitcoin 2013 San Jose' conference amateur videos and organizing them into 17 playlists for easy viewing. Feel free to do whatever you want with these.  Special thanks to the Bitcoin Foundation who organized the conference (fyi, I'm not associated with them), and the many outstanding lecturers - I was definitely impressed. I personally got a lot out of the conference, especially the networking with everyone, and getting to see the 'face' of Bitcoin, which might be quite different than one might imagine from only reading reddit or hanging out on IRC. I strongly recommend attending these events in the future if you can. Below I've provided a list of the 17 playlists, but please note that there were many more lectures that I could not attend occurring in parallel to these and thus I could not record those. As such, keep an eye out for the Bitcoin Foundation to release official videos to all the lectures in the near future, until then, enjoy these!

That means citizens can buy their pool pass, register for classes or events, reserve park shelters or ball fields, pay for utilities, or even pay parking tickets using bitcoin.

Well, it's only been a couple of days (including Good Friday, which I believe a lot of people take as vacation), but we've seen a noticeable uptick in municipalities contacting us for information.

There's too few data points to draw any meaningful conclusions at this point, but the raw numbers are ""As many in two days as we normally see in six weeks.""

You can draw your own conclusions.  And we'll see next week if that trend continues.  But my conclusion is that **""Bitcoin is a competitive advantage"".**

It's DanielTaylor again and I wanted to create a simple yet intuitive post to explain the folks out there what happened a couple of hours ago. This might also be useful for bloggers or journalists who might be going to write about it in the following hours. 

**TL;DR**

- The programs that read the blockchain, the bitcoin ledger, disagree. 

- Due to a bug in 0.7, it says that HIS is the correct version of this ledger and 0.8 says that HIS is the correct version. 

- Miners (the people who add pages to the blockchain) are told to switch to the 0.7 program so that this version gains more support and the other one is discarded. (orphaned). 

- Regular users are not affected. Their transactions are included in both ledgers and don't need to change any programs. 

- During that time, though, there is a slight chance of a double-spend ocurring. That is why people recommended merchants and exchanges to wait until there is one single blockchain again before processing purchases and merchandise. 

------

**The Blockchain Fork Explained**

As you might already know, there is this decentralized publicly mantained ledger. 

This huge ledger that tells everybody how much their bitcoin addresses are worth and how many bitcoins they have. This is the central piece of the Bitcoin network and is called the Blockchain. 

It is decentralized because everybody can add a new page to the ledger when they have the correct solution to a mathematical problem and there is no central authority. 

**So, what is a fork and why did it happen?**

In the computer world we use programs that interpret and read files for us. In order to read the blockchain we often use the Bitcoin client from bitcoin.org.

And reading this blockchain is very important for miners, because these are the people who keep trying to find mathematical solutions in order to be allowed to write the next page and get a small (25 BTC) reward. 

Some miners rely on the 0.8 version of the program and others haven't made the switch yet and rely on the older version, the 0.7. Think of these programs as accountants. 

There was a bug in the 0.7 version and, this ""accountant"", told the miners who were using it the following: ""The next page is invalid! Don't accept it!"".

At the same time, the 0.8 accountant told his people: ""WTF is he talking about? The next page of the ledger is perfectly valid. This is the correct version!""

0.7 answered: ""Only over my grave! THIS is the correct version"". 

And voilà, as you can see we now have two different ledgers. People who are using the 0.7 version of the program follow one ledger and people with the 0.8 version of the program follow the other ledger. 

**How was the problem solved?**

There must only be one unified blockchain, which means that we must discard one of the ledgers, while accepting the other as valid. 

Due to the bug, there was no way the 0.7 accountant would *ever* accept the new ledger (yes, he is very stubborn). For this reason we told miners to switch to this version so there would be a clear majority and we could discard the other.

As you can remember, miners are the people who add new pages to this ledger. Once miners switched to the 0.7 ledger, it became longer (with more additions) than its counterpart and it was clear that this was the winner. 

Finally, the 0.8 accountant accepted defeat and recognized the longer version as the legitimate one. (Because he has been cleverly programmed to do so. This is part of the Bitcoin protocol).

**What did this mean for regular users?**

Nothing. Almost.

A regular user making a transaction during that time would broadcast his transaction to both ledgers and it would be included in both. Obviously one would be abandoned sooner or later, but that doesn't matter to the regular user because he broadcasted it to both and he would be fine with whatever was the outcome. 

Also, no regular user needed to switch back to 0.7. That was only for miners, because we wanted to concentrate all miners on one side in order to make one ledger longer than the other. For regular users this didn't matter at all, as all clients would accept the eventual resulting ledger.

As you can see, for a regular user, there should have been no problem and there was absolutely no risk of losing bitcoins. The only problem was the increased risk of receiving a double-spend transaction. 

**What's a double-spend?**

This is the reason why some merchants and exchanges stopped processing incoming bitcoins for a couple of hours. 

The bitcoin network prevents people from spending the same coins by mantaining this unique ledger, the blockchain. But now that there were two of them, it was theoretically possible to broadcast two different transactions with the same coins and still get some confirmations. 

With some luck, someone could sneakily sneakily* buy a television to a merchant who was reading the 0.8 ledger and have the transaction confirmed. At the same time he could have sent the same coins back to himself and, with some luck, have the transaction confirmed on the 0.7 ledger. 

What happens is that, in the end when 0.7 wins, the thief will have the television and his bitcoins. Remember that there were two different versions of the same coins!

*This is not something easy to do and requires a lot of luck* because the blocks mined (the pages added to the ledger) must be mined precisely in the correct order. But still, in this situation it was easier to pull off and so it was recommended for merchants and exchanges to temporarily stop processing incoming transactions. 

Now the situation has resolved and the blockchain keeps growing happily, page by page, block y block. 

As you can see, for the regular user this should have been no trouble at all. People accepting bitcoins just needed to be more careful and wait for the situation to resolve before shipping or giving away their merchandise.

Anyone panic selling at the moment is giving them exactly what they want - at your own loss! Do you really think you are getting any sane order in at all when mtgox has a lag of over an hour? If everybody would just have sat back and relaxed, this wouldn't have been more than a blip on the radar.

Congratulations, you are now an investor in a new economy and a participant in a global experiment. If you understand what this new technology is capable of then I don't need to remind you here.  

But the thing is, you're actually more than just a typical shareholder. All a typical shareholder can do is evangalize to their friends and buy the company's products. Ultimately they can do very little to create value for the company and postively influence their investment. 

But this is where Bitcoin is very different. YOU DIRECTLY have the opportunity to influence the value of your investment.  As has been pointed out before, owning a bitcoin is like owning an ETF on the entire economy. When you add value to that economy, it becomes directly reflected in the price of bitcoins. The more companies that accept bitcoins, the more people using and benefiting from bitcoins, the more technologies built on Bitcoin; all of these add trust and value to Bitcoin. 

If you're a programmer, make some apps, or even contribute to the Bitcoin project itself. If you're a FED-hating gold horder, convince your FED-hating  gold hording friends of the unique properties of bitcoins as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. If you're an internet user (going out on a limb here) convince the companies you buy things from to accept bitcoins. And if you are just a general user, get educated and tell your friends and family why this could very well end up being a huge and disruptive technology that benefits everyone. 

If you want bitcoins to be worth several thousands dollars, YOU can make it happen. This is open source software, a decentralized peer-to-peer network, and a participatory free-market economy. Go participate and lets make this experiment a successful one.

From Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_competition_law#European_Union_law

""Like all competition law, that in the UK has three main tasks.

- **Prohibiting agreements or practices that restrict free trading and competition between business entities.**	 This includes in particular the repression of cartels.

- **Banning abusive behaviour by a firm dominating a market, or anti-competitive practices that tend to lead to such a dominant position.**	 Practices controlled in this way may include predatory pricing, tying, price gouging, refusal to deal and many others.""

I know very little about the details of the law but isn't what the banks are doing?  (And this is not just in the UK!)  They are defending a monopoly that should never have been allowed to exist!

Transferwise has just been banned from sending money to Bitstamp: http://transferwise.com/blog/2013-04/notice-to-bitcoin-users-april-2013

Mtgox had their account in the UK closed.

Bitfloor USD withdrawals now open.,audenx,228,39,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1hrgt5/great_news_bitfloor_usd_withdrawals_now_open/,"For those who haven't seen it, Roman just posted the update we've all been waiting for on bitfloor.com:

&gt; We are pleased to announce that we are ready to start returning USD funds. Please follow the instructions on the withdraw page. If your account balance is over 3000 USD, you must first open an account with IAFCU and then provide your IAFCU account number.

=== === ===

**Update July 6, 12:56 PM Pacific:** I'm already getting emails and seeing responses here about various login/withdrawal/balance-related issues. I imagine it may take a few days for all the ins and outs of the refund process to become clear to all of us. If you are experiencing USD withdrawal-related issues (such as $0 balance showing up on your account when you know you had a positive balance) that are not resolved by 7/12, please send me a PM or email and I will start tracking those issues and reporting them to those on the update email list. If you would like to be added to that list, PM me your email address.

**Update July 6, 12:59 PM Pacific:** /u/sodoubleoggood reports that Bitfloor has removed all pending withdrawals, so for users who were seeing $0 balances due to pending withdrawals, check your account again to see if that's cleared up.

**Update July 7, 10:36 PM Pacific:** I have been receiving numerous reports of bugs and account access issues from users who are trying to submit their withdrawal requests. I am keeping track of these comments, but because Bitfloor just announced the refund process yesterday, I am asking everyone to give Bitfloor one more week (until 7/12) to start working through their backlog of customer support emails. If by the end of next week there does not appear to be progress, I will create a ""master list"" of issues reported to me and will use the email update list to communicate progress on those issues.

**Update July 10, 2:18 PM Pacific:** Understandably, a lot of people want to know when they're going to get their refunds now that they've submitted ID info to Bitfloor or IAFCU. I don't have any information from Bitfloor or IAFCU suggesting a specific timeline, but here are my thoughts on the matter.

Those in the &lt; $3,000 camp will be wondering about the timeline for verification of docs uploaded via Bitfloor. In the last few days before the exchange shut down, document verifications were taking 5-10 business days, so I could imagine the process taking the same amount of time now (and maybe longer since hundreds of customers are re-submitting their documents all at the same time). I don't believe Bitfloor has a large staff doing this manual processing the way that MtGox does, so I don't expect Bitfloor can get through thousands of verifications a day like they do.

Likewise, people in the IAFCU camp may need to wait several days for a phone call. IAFCU is a very small credit union ~~(and it may in fact be Jordan alone doing all account verifications)~~, and if my spreadsheet represents, say, half of all Bitfloor users, IAFCU may have already received a couple hundred new applications in the last few days, each of which requires a telephone confirmation step (and possibly even a confirmation of a donation sent to a local charity). So I won't be surprised if it takes a few more days for IAFCU applications to get processed.

I know it's frustrating that it's taking so long. But I still think our best bet continues to be patience.

**Update July 10, 10:42 PM Pacific:** SpottedMarley from bitcointalk.org posted [this message](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=179135.msg2703033#msg2703033) indicating that he has spoken to a person at IAFCU who is working on processing the new account applications. He includes a lot of interesting details.

_Here's what's currently appearing after I log in to my Bitfloor account._

_[Left-hand content area with the following instructions:]_

**USD Refunds**

In order to receive your USD refund, please read and follow the instructions below.

If your USD balance is 3000 USD or more, you must first open an account with IAFCU and provide your IAFCU account information and NOT your current bank account information.

Everyone is required to provide the following information:

* Name
* Copy of government ID
* Routing Number
* Account Number
* Current Address
* Phone Number

The cost for processing a refund (set by IAFCU) is 2.50 USD which will be deducted from your account balance. If your balance is below 2.50 USD we cannot process your refund at this time.

International Users should fill out the information below and use a SWIFT code in place of a routing number.

_Here's the email response I received from Internet Credit Union after I submitted my account application:_

Dear AudenX,

Ok so you have submitted your application for a new Account- If I were you I would saying:  Now What?

**First Step**

The next business day a real person in the good ole US of A will review what you sent and perhaps wonder why you forgot some information we really need.

**Second Step**

This real person (maybe even me) will call and verify you are really you.  So please pick up the phone or at least call us back.  

When we call,  answer the phone as three things will happen:

1. We are required to “Know our customers”.   This means that personal touch of actually speaking with you and verifying some of the information on your application.

2. We will give your account number .  If you want a really cool account number you can request one by donating either dollars or bitcoins.   Hey we are a not for profit and need to keep fees down for everyone.  Accounts numbers from 100-9,999 can be gotten by helping support us.  The lower or more special the number the higher the donation.

3. We will ask you if you want to set up A2A transfer from another financial institution.   Then you can transfer money from one those big banks that helped bring down the economy just a few years ago to us little but good guys that care about your financial well being.

**Third Step – Sign onto online banking:**

READ THIS, perhaps even print it and put on your frig next to those fruit or poetry word magnets, and  it will save us both lots puzzled states at a screen:

Log on now the day we call you and we mean today:

You need to log on with 24 hours of us creating your account and contacting you otherwise we will have to reset your PW.  And why take up your time on long call with us when you could be out there saving the world.  

**How do I log on?:**

We encourage people to jump from our home page: IAFCU.ORG.   Also then you can read my old and new blogs and make my dad happy.

**What do I do if its my first time?:**

Mainly answer the phone!   Part of being with a Credit Union is that we like to get to know our members and we will personally call you and walk you through how to get on and navigate online banking.

**Name that Account:**

Once on you may want to go to Nick Names Under XXX and change the names of your accounts.  Primary Share is called a Savings Account in the banking world and Share Draft is checking account.  Yup we can help you with that.

THANKS FOR JOINING AND BECOMING AN OWNER OF THE CREDIT UNION

_/u/df546rtghr65y4 asked an important question:_

_**So how is it that the IAFCU is able to issue accounts to people outside NJ?**_

Very good question.

This may seem weird to some customers who are new to [credit unions (Wikipedia article)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union), but if you've never used a credit union before, one of the first things to know is that their charters require them to have a well-defined ""field of membership"" that limits who is able to become a member. In the case of IAFCU, the field of membership is those who live or worship in New Brunswick, NJ. _However_, IAFCU can satisfy the field of membership requirement for those outside New Brunswick if they make a small donation to a New Brunswick-based nonprofit.

So for those who (like me) are opening an IAFCU account but reside outside of New Brunswick, here's the info you're going to receive from IAFCU when they call you (from an email exchange I had with Jordan):

&gt; Please note that if you live outside New Brunswick NJ the only other requirement is donate $5 (usually we ask $10 but understand circumstances) to a local charity.  There are four who are bitcoin friendly and worthy the one we deal with the most is [Elijah's Promise](http://www.elijahspromise.org/) they are a soup kitchen-food pantry and a lot more.  They have no relation to us and it is tax deductible.  We can tell you about the others when we call you.

Although this might seem like a hassle to some, presumably everyone who is opening a new account with IAFCU has over $3,000 to recover from Bitfloor, and the $2.50 processing fee + $5 donation is hardly a loss compared to what we were fearing might happen (e.g. 25-50% loss through a class-action lawsuit).

If I ever needed any of its funds, I'd punch in the generated private key and attach it to a new wallet.

Here's my address, created entirely from my memorized string of characters sent through one round of SHA256:

https://blockchain.info/address/14kzRY5rLmXUwgM2ZKbMtWSfouuvpT2PAL

I had 18.5BTC here. As of today, it's all gone. A transaction happened earlier today that I certainly didn't initiate. It was all sent to a brand new address I've never seen before, and the transfer of my BTC to this one is the only transaction ever for this other address.

I'm wrecked. This is a ton of money, and I thought I had the safest solution ever using a brain wallet. The private key string of mine was not at all cryptologically inpenetrable.... however I can't fathom how it would have been brute forced or ""guessed"". It was a string of letters and numbers with a discernible pattern, but it is a string of characters that I guarantee have never been typed on the internet, ever, outside of the two or three times I typed it out on the bitcointools address to confirm that I wasn't accidentally sending my bitcoin to a black hole.

Reddit, how does something like this happen? Is there some kind of absurd chance that the funds transferred to this new address somehow have an assocation with the private key that generated my original address? Is there some chance that the bitcoin appspot website tracks stuff people type to steal wallets?

I'm even willing to share the damn private key string I invented to someone respectable in the Bitcoin community to help them do research on what happened. I have nothing to lose. This really, really sucks. I decided to be ""safe"" and put everything there, so that's all the BTC I ever had.


EDIT: looks like the only logical explanation is that the bitcointools site is being run by a scammer. Why it took a month for him to steal my coins I have no damn idea, but I'm devastated. :( Guys, please upvote this so people can be aware to NOT create brain wallets using this damn site!!

I've learned my lesson for the future. Once I get out of this state of shock, I'm going to get an encrypted wallet.dat, put it in a safe place, back it up, lock it up, and that will be the end of it. All offline.

With the recent Bitcoin “bubble” fiasco and the subsequent rise and fall of Bitcoin value, it seems that this subreddit has become obsessed with making money. But get-rich-quick schemes are not at the heart of  Bitcoin. Instead BTC should be seen as a way to keep Big Governments and Big Businesses from knowing how much money you have and what you choose to spend that money on. As a currency, it doesn't matter how much the value fluctuates if you plan on spending your wealth on sites like the Silk Road and etc.

(OK, maybe it does matter a little bit if the money you spent yesterday is worth twice as much today; but this guide is for spenders, not hoarders. Or at least for hoarders who also like to spend.)


Let's discuss my favorite attribute of the Bitcoin protocol: anonymity.

Many noobs getting into the Bitcoin game fail to realize that anonymity is an important key to understanding the importance of Bitcoin. In places where your wealth can easily be taking away from you (see Cyprus, Russia, China, the USA and others), Bitcoin can function like a store of cash buried in a dessert in the middle of nowhere – buried so deep that nobody can find it, not even the most powerful men and women on Earth. 

**POINT:** *If you are purchasing your Bitcoins through services like Coinbase or Mt. Gox, and if you've ever given your real name and bank account information to a Bitcoin Exchange, then you are NOT anonymous. Your Bitcoins can be traced back to you. Your purchases are recorded in the blockchain, and although it's difficult, it's certainly not impossible for those with the knowhow to find you and prosecute you. See [this link](http://decryptedmatrix.com/live/an-analysis-of-anonymity-in-the-bitcoin-system) before continuing.* 

Bitcoin is not inherently anonymous. You must take steps to protect yourself in order to keep your identity a secret. And even still, if you don't know what you are doing, you run the risk of being caught. So if you care about hiding yourself and your money, I offer this guide as a way to accomplish secret purchases and covert trades. Of course I cannot guarantee you won't end up in jail. At the end of the day, nobody knows how closely governments are tracking BTC purchases over the TOR network. Some people even believe that the TOR network was created by nefarious forces. I doubt it, but you never really know. 

**STEP ONE: Anonymous Hardware**

Because you cannot *really* know whether or not you are being watched, your first step in creating an anonymous wallet is to protect yourself by buying a **cheap** laptop computer and removing the hard-drive. Really, who needs a hard-drive anyway? Toss it in the garbage.  

**STEP TWO: Anonymous Software**

~~If you don't know how to download a Linux LiveCD, then stop reading now. You are probably not skilled enough to protect yourself anyway.~~ If you don't know how to download a Linux LiveCD, then proceed with extreme caution; downloading an ISO file and burning it to a DVD is pretty damned easy. Easier than anonymity. Those who refuse to learn are at risk.

It's arguable which software you should use, but I recommend connecting to the TOR network using [TAILS](https://tails.boum.org/), a live DVD or live USB that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. TAILS helps you to use the Internet anonymously, leave no trace on the computer you're using, and to use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, email and instant messaging. 

**ProTip:** For an extra layer of protection, download the ISO from your local library's computer. Or while you're sipping a mocha at Starbuck's. Then burn it to a DVD and take it home. Place it in your crap computer (the one without a hard-drive) and turn it on. Enter the BIOS menu and boot from CD if your computer doesn't do it automatically.

DO NOT CONNECT TO THE NETWORK FROM YOUR HOME.

I repeat, for an extra layer of security, DO NOT CONNECT TO YOUR HOME WIFI USING TAILS IF YOU WANT TO DO SHADY THINGS. That's just common sense. TAILS itself isn't illegal. But if you're the type to do shady things, you don't want to practice on your home Wifi, which you probably pay for with a bank account or credit card. 

After you've spent a day or two using TAILS and familiarizing yourself with the LinuxOS, and once you feel comfortable enough to continue, then head back to your local Starbucks, boot up the LiveCD, and connect. Browse the TOR network and triple-check that you are protected. You can do this by [checking your IP address for DNS LEAKS](http://www.dnsleaktest.com/). Only if you feel comfortably hidden from prying eyes will you want to continue.

**STEP THREE: Creating an Anonymous Wallet**

There are [several different ways to to this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b9p8d/how_unsafe_is_it_to_use_bitaddressorg_to_generate/), but the easiest way is to use the code at [bitadress.org](https://www.bitaddress.org). Thanks to /u/SpenserHanson for creating [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b9p8d/how_unsafe_is_it_to_use_bitaddressorg_to_generate/) which describes the process in detail:

1. Save bitaddress.org.html to your computer
2. Close browser.
3. Disable computer Wi-Fi.
4. Open bitaddress.org.html in browser. 
5. Generate an address and record the private keys.
6. Close the browser window.
7. Go home. Think about what you are about to do.

**STEP FOUR: Funding the Anonymous Wallet**

Funding your wallet will be the most difficult part of this process. Obviously you don't want to go to a site like Coinbase or Mt. Gox and link up you bank account, then start sending coins to your anonymous address. That would be stupid. Very stupid.

Probably the best way to get coins is to know someone who is willing to send you a few, but even then you lead a trail back to your friend. 

My suggestion is to make cash deposits through ZipZap or Bitinstant, and give them false information (for example, use the new email you created, over the TOR network, from a site like Hotmail or Yahoo, which doesn't require a phone number to sign up – I'm looking at you Gmail. Make sure your new account  forwards your email to yet another account, perhaps Tormail or a temp address. You probably won't need to use the email more than once anyway, for confirmation, if you need it. And you might want to create a new address with every deposit, just to be safe). There are other options of course. Some companies will sell you Bitcoins anonymously through Bank of America cash deposits. But remember that the moment you walk into a Big Bank and give them money, you are caught on camera. Maybe offer a homeless man some money to make the deposit for you. And hope he doesn't just pocket your money. Regardless, you want to stay away from Big Banks if you can. It really isn't that hard.

If you absolutely must make deposits from your bank account, you could send your coins to an anonymous online wallet first and then to cold storage, but make sure to use several mixing services over a period of several days. And then have trouble sleeping at night.

Another great idea is to use the [localbitcoins website](http://localbitcoins.com/); meet with a seller locally; pay cash and GTFO.

   
**STEP FOUR: Spending from the Anonymous Wallet**

 If you are looking to CASH OUT, there aren't many anonymous options besides meeting with somebody and selling face to face. You could always sign up for your own account at localbitcoins, then hope a buyer contacts you. But this guide isn't about making money, it's about spending your coins.

To buy things, you'll want to go to back to the library, connect through TAILS, download a lite client like Electrum and access your account. Every time you want to spend, you will have to re-download, but it should not take more than a few minutes. And though you are probably safe enough to spend directly from the client, if you really want to be safe you should send the funds to a second wallet though a mixing service, then to a third or fourth or fifth wallet, also through mixing services. These “Mixing Wallets” should NOT be created using the TOR network because the TOR exit node may be monitored. I've never had a problem myself, but it's theoretically possible that an attacker could record the password/private keys for the hosted wallet and steal your coins. Which is why you should NEVER USE THE SAME ACCOUNT TWICE. And never access your cold storage wallet through the net. That would be very very bad.

To created the mixing wallets you will also need a way to hide your identify without using TOR. The best way to do this is to sign up for a VPN service though a public WiFi hotspot and then pay in Bitcoin. The best service I have found is called [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/). You can access their service through a public computer, connect to the VPN, and voila, you now can safely create mixing wallets without exposing your password to the open network. Make sure that after you mix the coins you send them all to a safe, final address, which will be your Spending Wallet. 

Remaining anonymous will cost your some time and money. With each transaction you're going to have to pay for mixing, and also the transaction fee. And setting up a new email and a new account with every transaction (so that you can spread the coins across multiple fake accounts) will be bothersome but worth it in the long run. You can't put a price on piece of mind when it comes to your safety. 

**REMEMBER** Your Spending Wallet should not contain all of your funds. The bulk of your coins should be address you created using bitaddress. Never trust an online service to hold the bulk of your funds. The recent hacks have shown that the best place to store your private key is in your head.

**Final Notes:**

The Bitcoin protocol itself is not anonymous. And theoretically it's possible to trace every transaction back to you. This is why you need to use fake emails, many multiple addresses, and a VPN service with heavy encryption. Even with the knowledge and the technology to map the blockchain, the FEDS will have a hell of a time tracking multiple address though VPN tunneling back to a cold storage wallet that you created offline and only use to send coins over TOR. There are just too many roadblocks. Of course nothing is impossible. But I sleep very good at night knowing that my door is not going to be kicked in by the Men in Black. And even if you're not doing anything illegal, this sort of behavior is certainly suspicious.

If you were lucky enough to receive a tip from Reddit's own /u/bitcoinbillionaire (I myself was not) and you haven't cashed out. Create a VPN-tunneled throwaway account and tip yourself before claiming your coins. Then send them through a mixing service and to your cold storage address. Now you're on your way to being an anonymous spender. 

I hope this guide helps. I really do. **The purpose of Bitcoin isn't to make money. It's to protect the money that you already have, and to protect your identity in places where your identity is compromised.** Everybody in the world wants your money, especially the richest of the rich. You ought to do everything you can to keep yourself safe. Especially if you live in a compromised geography.

1365872059.0,184,self.Bitcoin,1c9xr7,"PSA: Using paper wallets, understanding change addresses.",explainschange,217,33,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c9xr7/psa_using_paper_wallets_understanding_change/,"[Paper wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet) are a handy little store of a private key offline. Unfortunately, many people seem to misunderstand one of the fundamentals of how they work, and subsequently lose vast amounts of money. Storage in a paper wallet is completely safe, retrieving the funds from one is less so. 

In typical use, a paper wallet would be retrieved into a client using the `importprivkey` command, and from there it should be assumed at the paper wallet is completely useless. From the moment the first transaction is made, the paper wallet is empty, this is due to the way to the way that the client handles change. 

Lets explore this with an example.

--------

Let's imagine that I send the full contents of my paper wallet (5BTC) to a new address, once I have imported it to bitcoin-qt. 


    +-------+
    | paper |
    +-------+
        |
        | 
        |
        V
    +--------------------+   
    | destination (5BTC) |    
    +--------------------+   



This is the expected behaviour, my paper wallet now contains 0 bitcoin, and the receiving address contains 5BTC.

This time, I am going to send 1BTC to an address from my 5BTC wallet, and keep 4BTC in my paper wallet for later. 


    +-------+
    | paper |
    +-------+
        |
        +------------------------+
        |                        |
        V                        V
    +--------------------+    +---------------+
    | destination (1BTC) |    | change (4BTC) |
    +--------------------+    +---------------+

Unfortunately this isn't how bitcoin works. There is now nothing in my paper wallet, and 4BTC has been moved to a new ""change"" address. If you wish to keep this amount in an offline address than, you must create a *new* paper wallet for this change. 


The mistake people have made in the past is to import a paper wallet with 100BTC in it, spend one or two, and then assume that the paper wallet still holds 98BTC. 

----------

This situation is *only* an issue if you reimport a wallet and expect the funds to remain on it. This issue doesn't apply if you are using your wallet normally. 

----------

Hope this saves people some serious hassle, and money.

Veterans of Bitcoin and /r/Bitcoin my plea is to please help out this small, fast growing community by positively teaching those who don't know as much. There was a time when you knew jack squat about Bitcoin - don't be rude simply because someone hasn't learned what you've learned already.

Furthermore, those veterans who are knowledgeable *please* spend time in [http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/). There are several new posts each hour - many of them by Bitcoin newcommers. I try to spend much of my time in the new section but I don't consider myself a veteran but rather an intermediate. If you can help guide the curiosities of these people we will see an explosion of Bitcoiners.

People will adopt Bitcoin with your help and guidance. This is not an easy topic for many people. The more people who adopt Bitcoin the more Bitcoin's network and value grows.

Here is the transcribed ticket:

---

Hello,
I was not sure where to address this concern so I did the best I could in selecting the right categories for my question.

I was wondering if Steam would look into accepting Bitcoin as an additional payment option for Games, DLC and software? Looking at the list of payment methods you currently offer I believe the accepting Bitcoins would bolster the revenue Steam could take in from Bitcoin.

I'm not a salesman, I'm not trying to sell anything I would just like the opportunity to pay for my Steam Games with Bitcoin. I know VALVE is an industry leader and has often set the tone and standard for many video game companies. I have been a long and loyal customer for years and purchase all of my games through your services.

Bitcoins have been steadily gaining popularity and value. There is a slight learning curve but when you grasp the inner working of Bitcoin you can see why it is gaining acceptance by merchants and users alike.

Bitcoin is an online, digital peer-2-peer crypto-currency. There are no or low fees and payments can be accepted worldwide, effectively eliminating the clutter of payment methods. Bitcoins are stored in a user (or merchant's) unique wallet and transactions are authenticated by the Bitcoin network.

There is a lot more to it but I will live it up to your organization to decide how and when is best to accept Bitcoin. If you could escalate this ticket or pass it on upwards I (and many others) would appreciate your consideration.

Thanks!

I am pretty excited to see if VALVE would consider adopting Bitcoin as a payment method. I think that would *really* send ripples throughout the gaming world and stimulate the Bitcoin economy.

I will update this with their responses if there are any.

Today I received a call from my bank asking why I send the money.  I told them in was none of their business.  

The bank said this company is involved in bitcoin trading and asked if I used the money to buy bitcoins.  Again, I said none of your business.  

Finally they asked if I was involved in buying and selling any virtual currency, to which I replied I would not be answering any more questions about my transactions.

What the hell is going on?

EDIT-

After gathering my wits and reading opinions here I went back to the bank.  

First off, understand this this bank is not a national bank.  They are regional with about 10-15 branches in my suburban area.  I chose this bank because I am very untrustworthy of banks, especially big ones.  When opening my account I felt a connection with the branch manager and some employees.  I have banked here for several years.  They know my name.  Some tellers remember my account number.  We have a good relationship.

My plan was to sit with the branch manager and answer the questions (since he knew the answers anyway) and then find out why I was being questioned.  If things went poorly I planned on asking why I should keep my money at the bank instead of choosing a better one.  None of this happened.

Instead, I walked in and immediately saw the branch manager wasn't there.  So I sat down with the personal banker who called me.  I told her that I didn't want to get her in trouble so I had changed my mind and was there to answer her questions. I asked if she had already told what happened earlier to her supervisors and she said no.  So that was good.

She pulled out a pad of paper where she had written my responses and explained that her district manager had asked her to make the inquiries about my account.  She said the branch manager was on vacation this week.  When I asked if the branch manager usually does this kind of stuff she said yes, the regional was covering for the branch manager.  She also mentioned that the regional manager was relatively new.  She opened an email.

I can see the email she had received from her supervisor on her computer screen and saw that he had a number of things for her to do.  One of them was to question me.  I volunteered to help her answer the email so she looks good to the new boss.  She agreed.  We read the email together.

Turns out the guy researched Mtgox on his own and became curious about bitcoins.  The way he had worded his email was not threatening but more like he was on a quest for more information.  The final question he wrote his banker was to find out what I thought about bitcoins in general.  There was also some nonsense about me withdrawing a lot of money in cash which didn't happen, but that's another story.  Anyway, she ripped up my earlier comments and we wrote out a better response.

I got to proofread her email as she typed a response to the regional.  I followed evoorhees's advice and said I bought them as a one time investment and did not plan on doing it again.  The personal banker said in the email that I would love to speak with the boss personally and gave him my number.  I left the bank feeling 10 pounds lighter.

**BTC-E.com**

To pay into this exchange, you need a BTC-E code, PM or Okpay. Take pics of your ID and utility bill and pay the $10 to Okpay for 'quick verification'. You can pay bitcoins directly into your Okpay account for initial funding or wait and see how long it takes for reg verification. 

Now either wire money, or instant money transfer (MoneyPolo, Contact-sys, Unistream) to fund your account or find an Okpay exchanger somewhere. Or Ukash/CashU. Just because contact-sys is Russian doesn't mean there aren't sending points in every country in the world. 

BTC-E codes you buy on #bitcoin-otc from verified gpg authenticated traders with good ratings, or on bitcointalk.org forums in the currency exchange forums.

Perfect Money is a shady HYIP digital currency run by Russians much like Liberty Reserve. You sign up for free, and load your account with wires (if verified) or you use an exchanger. This is what talkgold.com is for to find legit exchangers. I use wm-center.com to wire WU/Moneygram and get PM. Click on 'Interkassa' payment method in BTC-E and select Perfect Money. Instant load.

You can also obviously dump Litecoins you bought on Vircurex to fund the account, or a gagillion PPcoins

**Bitfloor.com**

Fastest way to deposit is through CapitalOne P2P or cash deposit
https://bitfloor.com/docs/#funding-deposit

Be aware Bitfloor is insolvent due to owing 25k bitcoins that were stolen last year but they have a repayment schedule that may or may not bankrupt them. Use at own risk but most ppl trade there everyday with no problems.

**Bitstamp.net**

Great exchange in Slovakia? I think. You have to pay with Euro SEPA wire, then for some stupid reason they convert the money to USD. You can pay in here using transferwise.com if you're from UK, or XEtrade and other Forex online money transfer companies. Google 'free money transfer fx' and review your options. Most don't charge you anything if over a certain amount of money. They take your internet billing or other local payment, convert to EUR and send SEPA for you if you request it. If they don't then check with Bitstamp what a SWIFT wire costs (probably nothing, I think they use Latvian banks that charge no receiving fees). If you want a bank account in Latvia then sign up here: http://www.rietumu.com/ if you have a local corporation or business where you live you can, maybe a personal account too. You can always incorporate a dirt cheap Delaware LLC or Oregon LLC from anywhere in the world and use it to open up worldwide bank accounts.

**Bitcoin-24.com**

Takes direct wires, all sorts of other methods: https://bitcoin-24.com/fees
You can also use Liqpay if you have a USD or EUR card. Sign up to liqpay.com, then they block a small verification amount you have to sign into internet banking (for the card) to check. It's usually $1.something or less. After that you are verified to load $1-100 or so, but I'd just try $50 at first. Any more than that and Liqpay will seize the funds and ask for your bank to authorize a fax they send which no bank will do because of privacy reasons, so pointless to load anymore money. Liqpay may also call you to verify card details this is normal. Liqpay is meant for Russians and CIS countries to use like Ukraine so due to epic fraud of credit cards don't expect to load too much this way unless you find a Liqpay exchanger, but what's the point when you can just wire money to bitcoin-24 anyways. 

**Vircurex.com**

Good exchange, had some problems due to DDoS but so did all exchanges.
They only accept BTC, altcoins and VouchX for payment. You buy Vouchx here:
https://www.aurumxchange.com/ or from somebody on Bitcointalk, or IRC (with rep). You can buy a bunch of litecoins anywhere to fund this exchange such as the bitcointalk forums or IRC. Warning: the so-called official twitter account is fake, don't use it. 

**Cavirtex.com**

Can only fund if in Canada, they accept cash deposit and internet billing. Price has been steady at ~$90 all day though no panic selling. 

**LibertyBit.com**

https://www.libertybit.com/funding various easy methods, new exchange in Canada that takes intl wires and shockingly Interac deposits (easily frauded).

**Bitcoin China**

https://btcchina.com/ fast growing exchange, you pay in with Alipay or Tenpay both Chinese methods that westerners can't use or figure out due to no translation. You can probably use Alipay if you find and exchanger to load it, they do exist. **Edit they now support Liberty Reserve deposit and withdrawal

Check english forums to see if anybody exchanging Alipay or taking wires.

**CampBX.com**

Accepts money orders, and CapitalOne P2P payments. Also accepts Dwolla but you need to be verified. 

**Bitcoin-central.net**

Just had a major outage due to instawallet hack, appears to be back online. You get your own quasi-bank account when you verify here much like how ecardone.com (liberty reserve) does banking so can transfer to other users legally with vouchers. You can buy a voucher p2p on Bitcointalk forums or IRC or send a bankwire. 

**VirWoX.com**

You can pay with Paypal to get Second Life ""Linden Dollars"" then convert to BTC, or at least you used to be able to. I have no idea if this is still the case I've never used them. 

**Or course there's all the fixed price exchangers**

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade and https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=53.0 for everything from Moneypak to Skrill. You can also risk buying coins on Silk Road with moneypak 

==============R U L E S   ================================


* Learn to use [#bitcoin-otc](http://bitcoin-otc.com/), you'll thank me later. It has the most buying/sell options. Use localbitcoins.com too if you can to avoid bullshit exchange problems
* ALWAYS USE 2-FACTOR ID ON EVERY EXCHANGE
* Always use 2-factor ID on the email you used to sign up for the exchange
* Don't click any links in BTC-E.com chat trollbox!!!
* Don't click any links PM'd to you on BTC-E.com from other users

Enjoy buying all the way down the crash once [Gox](http://i1110.photobucket.com/albums/h451/silvercent/goxed.png) comes back online and the great sell off begins! Hold them for a year and they'll be worth 10x as much just like the 2011 crash. Bonus points if you speculate on Litecoin, rumor has it Gox will be trading them when they come back online but again, this is [MtGox](http://i1110.photobucket.com/albums/h451/silvercent/goxedagain.png) we are talking about so the site could implode on the zerg rush of people trying to get into their accounts or trading engine could sell all your coins for $0.0001 again like they did in 2011. 

Great successez!

Beginning tomorrow, Thursday May 16, SatoshiDice.com will close to US players and all US-based IP’s will be blocked from the website. You will also see a new terms of service agreement to which you must 
agree if you wish to play.

This decision was made on the basis of extensive legal counsel. The best way to limit legal risk for SatoshiDice, and thereby protect its stakeholders, is to block US players. 

Note that this decision does not mean that online gambling is illegal in the US, nor does it mean that Bitcoin gaming is illegal. However, the courts have not been clear on the definition of gambling, nor 
on what would constitute “legitimate gaming,” nor are jurisdictions properly defined, and thus this is a proactive measure to protect those involved in the project.

Further, this decision is not being made because of any citation or notice from any government agency, whatsoever. This is not, in any way, related to the recent Gox/Dwolla court order issue. Again, it is a proactive measure, based on the prudent legal guidance of our trusted lawyers.

We believe this is a wise move for the site to perpetuate in the long term.  

Further, to clarify, SatoshiDice is hosted in Netherlands, Iceland, and Ireland, and has never utilized US currency or engaged with the US banking system whatsoever.

Saying that Bitcoin was created by hackers to not-so-tech-savy people who have never heard of Bitcoin automatically gives them a bad impression. From now on, whenever you explain Bitcoin and the subject gets brought up, you can truthfully say that they were ***software developers!*** Or if that's too much for you, you can just call them ***developers.*** Which is actually probably a more appropriate name. 

***EDIT:*** Ok so the term ""hacker"" is a very accurate title. But my argument is that it is not the best title that can be used. 98% of the people on this planet are not as computer literate as the people here and they will automatically associate it with something negative. Thank the news.

My only intention is to spread Bitcoin. The title you give the creators does not matter. What matters is the idea of Bitcoin, which already takes about 10 minutes to explain. Throwing in the concept of how a hacker can be a good thing is too much. In my opinion, you might as well avoid the chance of bias while still maintaining 100% accuracy in information and just call them ***developers.***

Yet, if you bring up the fact that Bitcoin has appreciated by over $100 in the last 6 months to newcomers, it seems a bit easier to get them to take you seriously. This is a bigger issue than it may seem.

The more Bitcoin appreciates in value, the easier it is for Bitcoin evangelists to point to the significant price increase as a benefit for adoption. It's fair game to do this, but what you're doing here is appealing to *greed*. Greed is super effective in persuasion, but it attracts people to Bitcoin who probably shouldn't be into Bitcoin. Those people being Wall Streeter types, who tend to get into things purely to profit from them. They will unquestionably be quick to jump ship at the first sign of any existential threat to Bitcoin.

The US Government in particular is believed to be *the* biggest threat to Bitcoin, but in truth it really wouldn't be the US government that killed Bitcoin; it would be the scores of greedsters deserting Bitcoin at first sign of strong government intervention that would kill it. You see, the more wishy washy people there are holding Bitcoins, the higher is the chance that Bitcoin itself doesn't survive an existential State sponsored threat.

*Take-Away*: Don't talk about the price, and don't talk about how rich you are. Talk about the ideology. Yes, it's boring and it does risk turning off lots of people, but that's a good thing. It creates a more stable base of enthusiastic Bitcoin users over the long term.

That said, I'm fairly certain many Bitcoin millionaires have been made in recent days. The second major threat, then, is how easy it is for us to get caught up in the success. It's easy to forget how vulnerable this success is, or how quickly markets can change direction.

The window of opportunity for making major strides with Bitcoin is wide open to everyone right now; but it will only stay this open for a very short period of time. That means, now is the time to kick things into high gear, and grab as much ground for Bitcoin as possible.

*Stop celebrating your success.*

At a certain point, Bitcoin **will** butt heads with the full force of the world's most powerful and corrupt institutions. They **will** commit every foul in the book against us in order to drag Bitcoin down with them should their powers ever be substantially threatened.

&gt; ""If I go down, I'm taking you with me!""
&gt; - Andross, last words before self-destructing in Starfox 64, highlighting the second major threat

To prepare for this day, we need to work together *in the open* on killer apps and world changing ideas- but we must do so anonymously. There's a reason Satoshi went by a pseudonym and disappeared. It's because if you look at history, anyone who messes with alternative currencies to subvert State sanctioned monopoly over money is *at best* reprimanded.

The beauty of Bitcoin is that, so long as you hold enough BTC, even if someone else takes your idea and succeeds with it, if your idea is in fact world changing, you still make a world-changing amount of money. The dynamics of the Bitcoin economy inherently encourage anonymous, open source collaboration on commercial development projects.

Bitcoin is completely different from most other industries in this regard. Because in the Bitcoin economy, you *want* your ideas to be ripped off and cloned: if your ideas are cloned and end up succeeding, your BTC purchasing power increases without you doing anything. Any major technological development will boost confidence in Bitcoin, and boost the exchange rate. Therefore, you can profit indirectly off of ANY success, even stolen success.

It bothers me that more developers don't recognize this, because I imagine there's a large number of individuals out there who are sitting on the ""idea of the century"", but can't execute on it properly without enlisting the help of others. These ideas are currently rotting, trapped inside the consciousness of a single entity until they inevitably perish.

How incredibly unfortunate it is that these ideas aren't released in full, so that they may be iterated upon, built upon if there's merit, or otherwise tossed out by the community. Regardless, openness in Bitcoin entrepreneuriship would exponentially enhance the creative process, which is what the Bitcoin economy needs to make leaps of progress, right now.

We *need* your ideas to be public, and those ideas probably should be developed by anonymous people (for safety's sake) who believe in Bitcoin's power to change the world.

To encourage this style of development, I'll be releasing a free series of guides on r/bitcoin over the following days and weeks called ""**Let's Get Cloaked**"". These will be of 'teach a man to fish' quality, and they will mostly be about how to do online anonymity and Bitcoin the right way, starting with hard disk encryption and graduating to anonymous communications.

The information will be dense.

My motivation is that I wish more people would take advantage of anonymity and the unique properties of Bitcoin to skip the secrecy and bullshit. We need to lose the facade of secrecy if Bitcoin is to rapidly take off in a big way, and gather unstoppable momentum that it *desperately needs*. Again, please refuse the urge to wallow in your very temporary success.

If you're sitting on the idea of the century, it's not doing anyone any good. Most businesses fail, and yours is no different. You probably need help seeing your idea through to fruition. If you truly have a world changing idea, you should want it to succeed at all costs; including the cost of having it taken from you. This is because the larger Bitcoin economy needs your idea to succeed to survive the coming existential threats. (see my previous posts). Even if your idea is stolen from you, your BTC stash will markedly appreciate in value anyway, and Bitcoin will rise. It's a win-win for the entire planet.

Text anything to the following number:

* **WORLD-WIDE:** +1 424-903-COIN *(2646)*
* **UK:** +44 1494 37COIN *(2646)*



You will receive a deposit address and a confirmation code (ex. ""4bdf""). You need this confirmation code to authorize your send command.

**Example Commands:**


* Send all 12223334444 (confirmation code)

This command will send your total balance to any mobile number on earth. In our example command, the recipient would be +1 222-333-4444. Even if your recipient does not have a bitcoin address, a new one will be assigned to them, much like the bitcointip bot. Once your transfer is successful, you will be deleted from our database and be treated as a new user.  **DO NOT INCLUDE ""+"" in your send command.**

*  Send 0.01 1DtRwaWxDH7yGby2LXueYjoTNygBCxnx6e (confirmation code)

This command will send 0.01 to the user specified public key.

* B

This command will return your current balance, deposit address, and confirmation code.

**How do I format phone numbers to work internationally?**

E.164 numbers can have a maximum of fifteen digits and should be written as follows: [country code][area code and mobile number].
**DO NOT INCLUDE ""+"" in your send command.**

For all available country codes please refer to this list: http://pastebin.com/SVKaVRwP

In the UK and many other countries internationally, local dialing requires the addition of a 0 in front of the mobile number, to use E.164 formatting, this 0 must be removed.
For example, to convert the UK phone number (07999 722222) to E.164 format, one would need to add the country code (which is 44) in front of the number (447999722222).

In these cases, there is NOTHING MtGox can do for you, the bitcoins are gone.

If you secure your account with Google Authenticator, you can set MtGox to only accept withdrawals if the authenticator code on your smart phone is entered. This means people will only be able to steal your bitcoins if they also steal your smartphone.

Here is the step-by-step for dummies:

1. MtGox -&gt; Security Center -&gt; Software Authenticators -&gt; Add New -&gt; you will see a bar code
2. On your Smart Phone, download Google Authenticator if you don't have it yet (there is an Android and iOS version)
3. In Google Authenticator -&gt; hit ""+"" to add a new authenticator -&gt; ""Scan Barcode"" -&gt; Scan MtGox's bar code
4. Back up either the bar code or the private key for the case you lose your smart phone.
5. Enter the MtGox number you see in your smart phone into the field in your browser
6. Drag this authenticator into Withdrawal AND ""Security Center"" (or even Login if you want to)

Done!

**EDIT**

reimeuk just pointed out that if an attacker can log in, they can remove the withdrawal authenticator without having to enter it again. I tested this and it's true. So, I've changed this to recommend setting it up for Login as well! It's not paranoid, it should be mandatory!

**EDIT 2**

Roujo pointed out you can also set the Authenticator for ""Security Center"" which makes it so the settings can't be changed without the Authenticator, so this makes it unnecessary to set it up for Login as well.

**EDIT 3**

Ender985 points out it might be a good step 3.5 to print the webpage with the QR and public an private keys, and/or save the webpage and store it somewhere: you might need to provide this information to unlink the authenticator in case of a lost or damaged smartphone.

**EDIT 4**

2.  First time bitcoin purchases are likely to be small, low-risk.

3.  $100/BTC is a significant psychological barrier to an unsophisticated buyer buying into bitcoin.

4.  There may exist a psychological inclination towards $1USD/mBTC

Therefore, it is proposed that we move exchange, POS and other bitcoin-related references to mBTC.

**EDIT:**  Of course it's psychological.  We're talking about money here, money is all made up, it's **all** psychological.

[UPDATE2: All 29 applications for new stores have been started. See your email. If you did not apply, visit the site above and hit ""get a store!""]

There's a really exciting community project called OpenBitcoinStore, which is making it easy for non-technical people to launch a complete bitcoin store, very quickly.

The project is in the final beta stage, with several stores in testing.

OpenBitcoinStore is based on WordPress, Woo Commerce, and Bitpay to offer a fully functional e-commerce store, with the following features:

* Easily define products and price them in any currency, including bitcoin
* Accept payments in bitcoin, via a Bitpay merchant account
* Host online, for free, on a number of hosting sites (Heroku, AWS etc)
* Also accept credit cards or Paypal, or Google Wallet, or many other payment types
* Handle complex shipping, by weight, or fixed, with multiple carriers worldwide
* Handles sales tax, both origin and destination
* Uses any existing Woo or WP template, many beautiful themes available for free 
* Can also sell intangible products, services or downloadable media, content or software
* All the code is open source
* Completely free


The project already has several beta testers, volunteers and we're looking for more. 

Join us if:

* You want to run a store and make bitcoin, for free. 
* You want to help bitcoin spread and have skills as a WordPress user, sysadmin, programmer, designer, PR, open source.
* You believe that there's much much more to bitcoin than illicit goods and want to help others make that come true.

_Let a thousand bitcoin stores bloom._

It’s related to the issue of change going to a different address that has been in contention lately, so figured it was relevant.


I managed to get my coins back today, and wow it feels good!


The cause of the missing coins was because I was making payments from the same wallet on two computers while they were syncing with the block chain. For whatever reason, a change address for a transaction went missing.
I had tried many times to load different wallets and rescan the blockchain again and again and never had any luck. In the end I had a mess of different wallet files, 16 in total, none of which included the relevant address when loaded in Bitcoin-qt.


Well after the price went over $100 I figured I would have another crack at it and took a different approach to see if I could recover the coins.


I installed [pywallet]( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34028.0) and did a dump of each wallet file that I had. I have never deleted a wallet file and this is what saved me.


I searched the dumped wallet files and in one of the files I found the address I was looking for! I assumed I must have missed this wallet so I loaded up Bitcoin with the relevant wallet and let it sync…. 


I was disappointed; the transactions as they loaded did not contain the change I had expected. But I had seen it in the dump of the wallet.dat it must be there!


I ran the following command within the Bitcoin console after unlocking the wallet.


    Dumpprivkey  &lt;bitcoin address&gt;


My heart skipped a beat, it returned a key!

I then imported this key to a blockchain.info wallet using the import feature and my balance adjusted! I had recovered my missing Bitcoins! I then transferred them to my new secure wallet and the transaction confirmed, happiest day of my life.


Here are some things I have learned that should probably be common knowledge for anyone using Bitcoin.


 * Keep a backup, don’t ever delete a wallet.dat file unless you are sure that your backup is up to date, this is what saved me in the end.

 * Be aware that a transaction can result in change that will go to a newly created address in your wallet.dat.

 * Encrypting your wallet will reset the 100 pre-generated addresses that are used for change and new addresses.
 * Don’t make transactions while waiting for the blockchain to sync.

 * If a wallet for some reason does not contain an expected transaction or address dump the data with [pywallet]( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34028.0) and search for any relevant information.

Keep your Bitcoins safe everyone!

This will allow us to keep Bitcoin strong and decentralized and take away the power of the state to target any individual foundation. We can set it up the same ways Shares are sold on the virtual exchanges, which gives voting rights to Bitcoin Address that register and we can keep it anonymous.

It is possible to access every email and password in the site, to forge fake withdraw petitions, to literally delete every proof that you ever had a bitcoin there, just for the lulz.

* **If you've invested money there, WITHDRAW IT NOW.** Do not use the interface, as requests can be deleted: send an email message signed with the Bitcoin account you used to send funds to the website. Do not rely only on sending an unsigned email, as your email address on the site can be changed.

* **If you've registered there, CHANGE YOUR EMAIL AND PASSWORD.** I can't stress this enough. Your password is stored as an unsalted MD5. This is vulnerable to dictionary attacks and to brute force attacks. If you use the same identity elsewhere, your whole internet persona is in danger. Change your email and your password as soon as possible, using the interface to do so within bitdaytrade.

You probably want proof of this. Register an account on bitdaytrade (DO NOT use your real password nor email, use a junk mail service for that) and tell me what email account you registered it with: I'll tell you the MD5 of the password you registered it with.

I'm not looking to profit from this, I want to help people.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Thylmann

Fabian Thylmann is the owner of some of the world’s most heavily used pornography websites (YouPorn, Pornhub, Mofos, etc), via his company Manwin, which has its headquarters in Luxembourg and offices in Hamburg, London, Los Angeles, Nicosia and Montreal. Combined, his sites generate some 16 billion hits per month and consequently are believed to be among the most popular websites on the planet.

Little is known of the reclusive Thylmann, other than he was born in 1978, is German, lives in Belgium, is married with two children and is a computer programmer. His breakthrough came in the late 1990s when he developed software called NATS (Next-generation Affiliate Tracking Software), which linked up the vast number of internet pornography sites for the first time and enabled visitors to select sex films according to personal preference.

He has only ever given one press interview, to the German edition of the Financial Times at a pornography trade fair in Las Vegas in 2011, which described him as 'The King of Porn'. At the time he welcomed the chance to ""clear up rumours"" and ""dispel conspiracy theories"" about his identity. ""NATS was very easy to use and could do what the others couldn't. Our objective is actually rather banal, we want to create as many opportunities as possible for people to spend money."" He has not spoken publicly since.

Germany's Focus magazine claimed that he has revolutionised the business of pornography consumption by allowing the free viewing of pornographic video clips, while being paid for advertising pay-for-view pornographic sites. His success has led to claims that he has crippled the traditional porn industry.

In December 2012, he was extradited from Belgium to Germany on suspicion of tax evasion on the estimated £60 million annual profits his company allegedly makes. Thylmann did not contest the extradition order.

Today I received a request to discuss it with the head of product for our division.  I'm not sure if this will be tomorrow, or maybe next week, but I want to make sure I'm prepared and able to make a good case for Bitcoin and how it can help our merchants, where things are, and where things need to go.

I'm thinking given our industry and position, that there's not as much need  to discuss it as a currency, and focus mostly on it as a payment method, of course I'll be ready for both.  Thoughts? 

Key points I'd like to make is that for our Merchants

* They do not need to worry about charge backs.
 
* Even with volatility as it is today, merchants can minimize/eliminate the risk using a service like Bitpay.  Potential to create, or partner with a similar service.

* Lower fees for our merchants allowing them to grow more quickly.

* They can offer discounts to draw more sales in.
 
In terms of how we can continue to earn money given that we'd be charging lower fees for these transactions

* Bitcoin is in need of someone to develop a secure online wallet that merchants can trust to keep funds in if they wish to maintain sales in Bitcoin.

* Bitcoin can benefit from someone creating a trusted escrow service for larger transactions. (Counter to no chargebacks, but still needed)

* We're adding value to the merchant by giving them the ability to integrate with one provider, keeping all records and service needs in one place.  This will encourage them to stay with us rather than give their business to someone else.

What do people think? Where else could I take the discussion?  I'll be going over the myth list so I can be prepared to dispel them.  

I'm not sure how long I'll have so the more prepared the better things will go!

Edit: how did I fuck that title up... sigh

Edit3: Wow!  Thank you everyone for the replies overnight!  Lots of good great things in there!  I do plan  to start things off asking about what they already know, want to know and then having the discussion go from there. I don't want to just be preaching!  I promise I won't simply sugar coat everything as well. I know there's still issues that are being worked out.

I've seen an increasing amount of people who think that saving (or ""hoarding"") is somehow bad for bitcoin.  I'd like to take a moment to dispel this myth.

It's important to remember that saving *is* spending.  This may sound paradoxical, but it's important to keep an open mind.  If you're in r/bitcoin, chances are good that you've already realized that most of what you've been told about economics was a lie.  My advice to you is to keep going down that rabbit hole.

Saving is deferred spending.  Nobody is buying bitcoin with the intent of setting fire to their computer.  Saving is also spending in the present.  People who hold bitcoin and opt not to use them are spending an opportunity cost to consume in the moment in hopes for a greater ability to spend in the future.  This is perfectly normal when the price of bitcoin is increasing so rapidly.  Any attempt to dissuade people of this is utterly futile.  

This leads me to my next point.  How does a market based on bitcoin work?  If one were to peruse reddit, the impression would be thus: Those who hold bitcoin are berated into using their wealth however the collective feels is most appropriate.

If you believe this is an appropriate way to organize an economy, I strongly urge you to pick up a copy of [The Road to Serfdom by F. A. Hayek.](http://mises.org/document/2402/The-Road-to-Serfdom) (link to free copy)  In it you will find that a sustainable economy requires the understanding that people will act however they are incentivized to act.  That means that people who see the value of bitcoin increasing are incentivized to save.  Arguing against this is futile.

It's important to understand that bitcoin will reach a market equilibrium.  The price *will* stabilize eventually.  At that point, spending will increase.  

Those who insist on berating people into acting against their own rational self interest are only displaying 1) that they do not respect the rightful decisions of others to use their property as they see fit; and 2) that they do not understand the fundamentals of an economy.  

Lastly, I see a lot of new people on /r/bitcoin asking for advice on buying bitcoins for the express purpose of making money in the short term (speculators).  I also see a lot of posts on how to encourage people to adopt bitcoin.  Then I see people berating speculators.  I'll leave you to your own conclusions on that point.

Thanks for your time!

EDIT:  I almost forgot.  One of the most damaging things to an economy is irrational spending.  (See again: Hayek on ""the paradox of saving"")  Encouraging people to spend their money irrationally is *actually* harmful to the economy because it causes wealth to be used inefficiently.",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,1365481318.0,,,True,t3_1bywgr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bywgr/in_defense_of_saving/,

Watching the price of coins fluctuate on bitcoinity today, I had a wave of ""what the fuck"" hit me.

I'm 35. Do you know how much crazy, totally insane shit I have seen in my short lifetime?

If you are in your 20's, you may not really grasp how INSANE it is (in a good way) to be talking about a ""virtual currency"" that can complement &amp; compete with MONEY.

WHAT?!? WHEN I WAS 10 NOBODY EVEN HAD COMPUTERS.

It was a crazy thing that rich kid's dads might have to do ""Lotus 1-2-3"" on, whatever that was. Nobody had one because nobody could even fathom why you'd WANT one.

They had some ""computers"" at school, and once in a while during ""Library class"" they'd let you play a game on it called ""Oregon Trail"" which was like a Nintendo game, but way cooler. The other games were all about math and sucked. THATS IT.

YOU COULD NOT EXPLAIN TO 10-YEAR-OLD-ME the idea of ""paying for a sandwich with your phone in bitcoins"". It's so bizarre, so many layers of ALIEN STUFF that did not exist (even in SCI-Fi) back then!

Yeah, you could buy a newfangled ""cordless phone"", but it only reached to the kitchen before getting staticy, and it didn't have a fucking COMPUTER IN IT that could also show you PORNOGRAPHY.

My point is: Year after year, I saw THE NEXT BIG THING, and it blew me away, and I never saw it coming, and NOT ONCE WAS IT JUST A FAD. Not once did it go away. I can't think of any cool, never seen before ""WHOAAA, BRO"" thing that actually failed. Not once.

Specifics may change - ""reading messages on a BBS"" became ""reading usenet"" became ""reading reddit"", but the idea of ""talking to (hundreds-&gt;thousands-&gt;millions) of people you never met before"" never went away. But just the idea of ""talking to people from (NOT WHERE YOU LIVE)"" was TOTALLY CRAZY ALIEN stuff to 99% of the planet just 20 years ago. It still is, to a HUGE % of planet earth!

OF COURSE BITCOINS ARE THE NEXT BIG THING.

Don't listen to anyone who says otherwise. ""THE POST OFFICE IS GOING TO TAX EMAILS LOL"" remember that?

No, bitcoin WILL NOT REPLACE ""REAL MONEY"". It is an awesome complement to it, though. It's another tool in a toolbox.

Do you really think, in 20 years, we'll be using Xbox points, Wii points, Amazon coins, etc? Yeah, sure. Just like how people still use Prodigy and compuserve.

Don't get hung up on the Mt Gox price. It's not the BIG PICTURE.

So I'm going to try and post the main ideas down and dirty here and hopefully spur some discussion***

So I just convinced a local clinic here in Pensacola to take Bitcoin. 

Not convert BTC into fiat and then pay them. *Actually pay them directly with coin.*

This is great for Sean's Outpost and the homeless people we serve because health care for them is sparse. The ER's here are fickle to say the least, and even if they get seen. Follow up care is, non-existant. I have seen an ER prescribe medication to a patient, the medication cause an allergic reaction, and then the ER refuse to see that patient again because they consider it ""follow up care"". 

Its a nightmare.

Thanks to the generous donations of the Bitcoin community, I will soon be able to easily get homeless people in Pensacola, who really need to see a doctor, into see a doctor. 

By no stretch of the imagination this is Bitcoins being used to *save* lives.

And that is awesome. Really awesome. That clinic is really going to help the homeless here. And Bitcoin is helping to make that happen.

What I didn't realize until talking to the Doctors at that clinic was how much Bitcoin can actually help that clinic. And apparently,help most medical practices. 

Bitcoin can fix the cash flow problems that are plaguing most doctor's offices. Apparently, getting money out of an insurance company is akin to trying to get a dollar out of Eugene Krabs hand at the Krusty Krab (or maybe like taking Scrooge McDuck's lucky dime?).

The clinic was already giving a cash discount. Because cash helps keep them in business. They are treating Bitcoin like cash, and the discount will apply for it too. 

I'm still wrapping my mind around the implications Bitcoin can make in this area. I think this is low hanging fruit for the Bitcoin community. Know a Doctor? Talk to them about Bitcoin. You are a Doctor? Take Bitcoin. If you're an entrepreneur start a medical services business...that takes bitcoin. 

Health care in this country is a catastrophe. And that's probably doing catastrophes a disservice. 

How can we leverage Bitcoin to help fix that?

There was a great post on the frontpage of r/bitcoin today that had this comment in it...

""Bitcoin will become whatever we talk about."" 
DanielTaylor, Redditor

Can we start talking about how we could leverage Bitcoin to really disrupt the healthcare industry?

I have been invited to speak at Bitcoin 2013 about a new autonomous region that is going to come into existence by the end of this year. It is the result of many years of dedicated work coming to fruition.
 
The region’s laws are specifically being designed to have low regulatory barriers and provide residents with the world’s highest degree of freedoms. Freedom, and the experimentation it allows, create prosperity – and our mandate is to create a zone for such prosperity. We have decided to introduce this zone at Bitcoin 2013 because we think it will be of particular interest to you: It will be the first political zone in the world to officially recognize cryptocurrencies.

I am traveling down to the conference today, so I may not be able to be responsive here. But I am interested to hear what questions you have so that I can try and answer them during the talk.

I also published this question on the forums: 
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208333.0

I am excited to finally be able to talk about this and am looking forward to seeing you all.

1364211402.0,146,self.Bitcoin,1ayv2r,Important: Bitcoin users must decide on a new Transaction Fee,DanielTaylor,191,45,197,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ayv2r/important_bitcoin_users_must_decide_on_a_new/,"With value of the Bitcoin soaring at maximum heights, it might be time to review the current standard transaction fees.

Unlike traditional payment systems such as VISA and Paypal where fees are enforced by a central authority, *Bitcoin users have the democratic ability to decide what fee they want to pay.*

**It is NOT developers who decide the fee**, but the consensus of the majority of users who change the fee in their Bitcoin program's settings. 

Unfortunately, I have the feeling that this possibility is largely unknown to the userbase and many still think that they have to accept what someone else says. But in Bitcoin, and that's its beauty of it, *you have a voice and a vote.*

--------------

**How does it work?**

Fees work in a similar way to the Bitcoin market price. Ther are two forces that oppose each other and will balance on an equilibrium: users and miners.

Right now many miners don't accept anything less than 0.0005 which was the standard fee many months ago. Miners certainly don't have any incentive to lower the fees unless users start sending out transactions with lower fees. 

If every Bitcoin user, or a large majority, started to send out transactions with a 0.0001 fee instead (example), miners would be pressured to accept this as the new standard as they would lose a significant amount of money by not accepting them. 

Miners will never have an incentive to accept 0 fee transactions, but they will accept a fair, just and sensible offer set by a large group of users. 

**You choose what you believe is fair**

The idea is that you open your Bitcoin program's settings / Adjustments and set a fee that you believe should become the new standard. *This is how you vote.*

Bitcoin users are voting with each and every transaction. Keeping the fee at 0.0005 is a vote in favour of that fee, while lowering or raising the transaction fee is a vote for a different fee. 

The idea is that the community of users will reach a consensus. Obviously this consensus is much easier reached if people speak up. Right now there is no website to do this, but in future there might be a place called bitcoinfees.com or something similar that could offer an overview of the community's opinion on this topic. 

**Speak your mind reddit!**

Tell other users what you think the new standard fee should be and vote accordingly. To facilitate this task I have created [**This Poll**](http://poll.pollcode.com/ixs91) where you can vote and view the votes of others. 

-------------

**Last notes on miners and transaction fees**

Currently, transaction fees only suppose a tiny fraction of a miner's profit. The current block reward is 25 BTC and the Bitcoin value has been multiplied almost by six since last January. Lowering transaction fees does not mean taking miner's bread away, as they do benefit from the high market price as much as you do (supposing you hold bitcoins). 

While the Bitcoin price is free to go up, I believe that transaction fees should be kept at a reasonable limit and correspondingly adjusted. Personally, I set up my client to include a 0.0001 fee, because its value is similar to the value we had last January. 

Actually, the Bitcoin economy can greatly benefit from lower fees as it creates an incentive to send out more transactions and keep the money flowing. 

In conclusion, you don't need to wait until some developer tells what fee is or is not acceptable. Bitcoin has been designed to give you the choice: **Change your fee today!**

Google is a company who has showed to be ahead in granting to its users astonishing advantages with bleeding hedge open technology. Its support would mean the beginning of the real wide spread adoption of the virtual currency. 
Many are the risks and the drawbacks but also the adoption of the Internet had theirs in the early days and even if many of them have remained unchanged we are glad to be on it.

I'm currently doing some research for an article I hope to have published later this month.  I have a very, very rough draft at the moment and your feedback would be lovely.


**The Elephant in the Room**

Bitcoin is an enigma.  It has renowned economists like Paul Krugman entirely perplexed whilst Silicon Valley CEO's are falling over one another to get a piece of the action.  The headlines change on a daily basis: “It's A Ponzi Scheme!”, “It's Gold 2.0!” , “It's A Bubble!”, “It's The New Internet!”.  

As a result of these, often conflicting articles, it's value shoots up and down like a yo-yo, swinging wildly to the slightest bit of news, good or bad.  

Of course, these swings wouldn't be so exaggerated if there was a simple way to address the elephant in the room...is bitcoin legal?  

Government officials have been oddly quiet in addressing this question.  Aside from some rudimentary FINCEN guidelines and a vague ECB report, there's been no statement one way or another about its legal status.

Whilst I can't provide any definitive proof as to what decisions have and are being made behind closed government doors, I do think it's just possible we already have enough circumstantial evidence to suggest that the US government has already given Bitcoin the thumbs up.

**Satoshi's Lament**

Back in December 2010 Satoshi was involved in a heated discussion amongst Bitcoin developers on BitcoinTalk as to whether they should support Julian Assange by offering Bitcoin as a means to bypass the notorious banking blockade that had rendered Wikileaks' cash reserves impotent.  Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was extremely wary that any association with Julian and Wikileaks would 'bring too much heat' to the project.

“No, don't 'bring it on'” he pleaded with his fellow developers. “The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way.”  He went on to clarify. “I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy.  You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.”

By 'destroy us', he was likely talking about a government or corporation pulling the trigger on this nascent project.  Amongst other things, Satoshi was fearful that if a nefarious entity such as a commercial bank got wind of the project, at that point in time they could have easily compromised the project by purchasing enough computing power to overrun the network (known as a 51% attack).

Despite Satoshi's protestations, Wikileaks went along and adopted Bitcoin and, it seemed Satoshi's worst fears were confirmed when, just 4 months later in April 2011, Gavin Andresen (now lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation) announced that the C.I.A. had contacted him.

“I'm going to give a [presentation](http://www.Bitcointrading.com/pdf/GavinAndresenCIATalk.pdf) about Bitcoin at the C.I.A headquarters in June at an emerging technologies conference...I accepted the invitation to speak because the fact that I was invited means Bitcoin is already on their radar, and I think it might be a good chance to talk about why I think Bitcoin will make the world a better place. I think the goals of this project are to create a better currency...I don't think any of those goals are incompatible with the goals of government.”

Satoshi disappeared shortly after.

Gavin recently spoke to the New Yorker about the event.
""...I think people realized once I got invited to speak at the C.I.A. that there was no kind of hiding. They, whoever “they” are, already knew about this project.""
[Source: http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/04/the-future-of-Bitcoin.html] 

**The Silk Road Goes Live**

2011 also saw the release of the notorious 'Ebay for Drugs' website, Silk Road.  It received much press attention, first breaking in June via Gawker where a developer described his experience of buying LSD through the site as ""Kind of like being in the future"".  It was clear that the Silk Road was where Bitcoin would find its first major real-world trading niche and it's not a coincidence that the BTC price, client downloads and trading volume began to skyrocket after its inception.
[Source: http://gizmodo.com/5805928/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imaginable]

A week after the Gawker article, Senator Chuck Schumer called a press conference where he went on record demanding that the Silk Road be shut down “Something must be done about Silk Road...Literally, it allows buyers and users to sell illegal drugs online, including heroin, cocaine, and meth, and users sell by hiding their identities through a program that makes them virtually untraceable...[it's] the most brazen attempt to peddle drugs online that we have ever seen. It's more brazen than anything else by lightyears."" he told the assembled press.

As an aside, it is worth noting that the program that “hides user identities” is TOR, developed by the US Naval Research laboratory and endorsed by Senator Hilary Clinton (Schuman's former co-Senator from the state of New York) as “an important tool for freedom of expression around the world”.  Indeed, the TOR Project claims that over 80% of its funding in 2012 came directly from the U.S Government [Source: Tor Project Annual Report 2012]

**The Radar Screen Lights Up**

Suddenly, thanks to the Silk Road and Wikileaks, Bitcoin was now on the radar of those in public office.  The question on everyones lips must have been “How do we kill Bitcoin (and by extension Wikileaks and Silkroad)?”

The C.I.A, thanks to Gavin, were now fully aware of the threat Bitcoin posed to the the current monetary system, and the illegal activities it was funding via Silk Road and other places would have done nothing but confound their concerns (or so you would think).  They must have also known (just as Satoshi did) that if there was ever an opportunity to kill Bitcoin (either with regulation, criminal proceedings and/or a 51% attack) then it was back then, in 2011, with the network still in its infancy, that they should strike.  

We should have expected the kind of domain seizures that we saw with the likes of Megaupload; Bitcointalk, Bitcoin.org and the Bitcoin Foundation should have been wiped off the map.  They could have also moved with the banks to shutdown any accounts seen to be associated with Bitcoin trading (as we saw happen with Online Gambling websites during the Bush Regime).  They could have then disrupted what remained of the Bitcoin network by performing a relatively cheap and simple 51% attack.

And yet, none of that happened... Bitcoin.org and the Bitcoin Foundation have been left to prosper and go from strength to strength.  VC's, Wall Street traders and the average Joe were all left free to pump money into this burgeoning experiment without any government intervention whatsoever.

**Eric, Julian and the Bilderberg Group**

Back in 2010 Google dipped their toes into the world of virtual currencies, acquiring a little known company called Jambool for $70m.  For awhile they ran a platform called Social Gold which was later usurped in 2011 by Facebook Credits (Facebook's attempt at a virtual currency). This was phased out in mid-2012.  Techcrunch cites that this was likely due to the problems Facebook had encountered in educating the public about using another form of currency, and goes on to speculate that by offering a centralised means of exchange, Facebook may have also faced increasing legal and regulatory scrutiny.

In June 2011, Julian Assange met Eric Schmidt online in a secret 5 hour chat in which they discussed - amongst other things - Bitcoin.  The full transcript - which was leaked last month - is available here: http://wikileaks.org/Transcript-Meeting-Assange-Schmidt

Also in attendance at the meeting was Jared Cohen, a former Secretary of State advisor to Hillary Clinton, Scott Malcomson, Director of Speechwriting for Ambassador Susan Rice at the US State Department and current Communications Director of the International Crisis Group, and Lisa Shields, Vice President of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Here's an excerpt:

**JA:** ...there’s also a very nice little paper that I’ve seen in relation to Bitcoin, that… you know about Bitcoin?

**ES:** No.

**JA:** Okay, Bitcoin is something that evolved out of the cypherpunks a couple of years ago, and it is an alternative… it is a stateless currency.

…

**JA:** And very important, actually. It has a few problems. But its innovations exceed its problems. Now there has been innovations along these lines in many different paths of digital currencies, anonymous, untraceable etc. People have been experimenting with over the past 20 years. The Bitcoin actually has the balance and incentives right, and that is why it is starting to take off. The different combination of these things. No central nodes. It is all point to point. One does not need to trust any central mint….

...

**ES:** That's very interesting


So, now we know Bitcoin was on the radar of the C.I.A, various politicians and, thanks to Julian, the CEO of Google was now beginning to get an inkling as to its disruptive potential.

Just 13 days prior to the Assange meet, Eric had attended the annual meeting of the notoriously secretive Bilderberg Group in St. Moritz, Switzerland and went on to attend the meet again in June 2012.

Topics of discussion included:

* Emerging Economies: Roles and Responsibilities
* Economic and National Security in a Digital Age
* Technological Innovation in Western Economies: Stagnation or Promise?
* Imbalances, Austerity and Growth

Some of the 2011/12 attendees included: 

* Josef Ackermann (Chairman of Deutsche Bank), 
* Jean-Claude Trichet (President of the European Central Bank), 
* Chris Hughes (Co-Founder of Facebook), 
* Reid Hoffman (CEO of Linkedin), 
* Jeff Bezos (CEO of Amazon)  
* Keith Alexander (Commander, US Cyber Command; Director, NSA).  

Heads of Barclays Bank, AXXA, HSBC and the President of The World Bank Group were also in attendance.

[Source: http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/index.php]

To see so many tech luminaries in attendance at Bilderberg is indicative of the kind of power and respect that geeks and hackers now command in shaping the world stage.  Just how many high-level decisions are being influenced by this new technorati is hard to say, but in a rapidly changing world where technology is moving faster than the old rules  remain relevant, we are seeing that people, united through technology on a global scale – not governments – are dictating the speed of change.

**Joining The Dots**

None of this means that bitcoins ride is going to be friction-free - just because Eric Schmidt is open to the idea of bitcoin displacing traditional currencies (as he and Jared Cohen alluded to in a recent CNBC interview), does not mean that Douglas Flint (Group Chairman, HSBC) is going to be equally enthused.   

However, I do think that if we join up all the dots the general conclusion that we can draw looks overwhelmingly positive for the future of bitcoin.  That so many powerful actors within the intelligence community, technology industry and government have let bitcoin survive this long is almost an endorsement itself. 

It suggests to me that any nefarious corporations that attempt to shutdown bitcoin because of a perceived threat to their business model, will be met by those same powerful actors coming together to ensure they will have a very tough fight on their hands.

Indeed, in the years to come, we may well see Hilary Clinton coming out to trumpet bitcoin as “an important tool for freedom of expression around the world” in much the same way she praised the TOR project.

And perhaps, ultimately, we will discover that bitcoin, like TOR, was also developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory.

Though I prefer to think it was just some lone genius sitting in his attic who accidentally changed the world.

Whatever may be the case, it seems that - for now at least - our governments have handed their people a rare gift – the freedom to shape their own future.    

It's up to us to try not to screw that up.  ",,False,self,t5_2s3qj,1367705071.0,,,True,t3_1dp4c4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1dp4c4/why_the_us_government_have_likely_already/,

So naturally I was excited to see that Bitspend is making it possible for me to buy groceries with bitcoin. My regular grocery store offers online ordering and delivery service through [My Web Grocer](http://mywebgrocer.com/), though until now I have never used it since the physical store is just a couple blocks away.

Timeline of ordering process:

* Mon. 11pm - Submit Bitspend order form, requesting Wednesday, 10am delivery time.
* Tues. 10am - Receive email from Bitspend confirming order receipt
* Tues. 12:40pm - Receive email from Bitspend indicating incomplete order information (I had given them URLs that lacked a store ID#, so I needed to specify which MWG store to order from)
* Tues. 3:52pm - Send email to Bitspend with the necessary information to complete my order
* Tues. 4:39pm - Receive invoice from Bitspend with wallet address and order cost, valid for 30 minutes. (I was away from my wallet so I could not pay at the time.)
* Tues. 7:20pm - Send email to Bitspend requesting new order cost and wallet address.
* Tues. 7:27pm - Receive new payment information
* Tues. 7:36pm - Payment initiated
* Tues. 7:45pm - Receive order receipt from MWG via email from Bitspend confirming placement of order
* Wed. 10:10am - First attempted delivery (I didn't hear the door knock)
* Wed. 11:35am - Wondering where the order is, I email Bitspend.
* Wed. 11:38am - Receive complete MWG invoice indicating order details (but no confirmation of scheduled delivery time)
* Wed. 11:43am - I call the grocery store directly and tell them that my order hasn't arrived yet. They immediately guess which address I'm calling from (I confirm) and tell me they will arrive in 5 minutes.
* Wed. 11:50am - Groceries arrive at my front door, I sign a receipt, and I receive physical copies of MWG invoice and grocery store transaction itemization.

Total turnaround time: ~36 hours.
___
**Pros:**

* All communication from Bitspend was impressively prompt.
* I got to order groceries with bitcoin (duh!)
* Bitspend normally asks for full confirmation of payment before proceeding with order. They offered to proceed after just 1 confirmation for my order since the requested delivery time was imminent.

**Cons:**

* Invoices received from Bitspend were often missing relevant information. I always had the information I needed to complete my part of the order process, but I would have liked to see more information so I know exactly what's going on. For example, when I received my initial order invoice and payment request, the order total (in $), MWG service charge (in $), Bitspend service charge (in $), and requested payment amount (in BTC) were all listed, but there was no subtotal (in $) listed, and no listed quote of MTGox weighted average (which was used to convert $ to BTC). Obviously I could figure this out with simple arithmetic, but it could easily be listed directly on the invoice to save me the hassle.
* Requested payment amounts were quoted to 10^-15 BTC, while transactions are limited to 10^-8 BTC, or 1 satoshi. I rounded to the nearest satoshi (which in my case was rounding up), and I asked Bitspend what was the appropriate way to truncate the amount, but I'm still not clear on what is expected. Requested payment amounts should simply be presented to the user with no more than 8 decimal places to avoid ambiguity.
* I included some produce in my order, such as 2 lbs of ground beef, which of course ended up delivered as something like 2.02 lbs. The amount I was charged by Bitspend reflects the amount indicated on my order form (in round numbers), while the amount Bitspend paid to MWG appears to reflect the amount that was actually delivered. Overall the price I paid to Bitspend was $1.15 too high for the amount of produce I received. I imagine this could swing in the user's favor at some point if the initial price were an underestimate (instead of the overestimate I paid). It would be nice if the price I pay accurately reflects the delivered products' price, but I'm not really sweating the difference. (This seems to be an issue with MWG itself, rather than Bitspend. See edit 1 below.)
* Including MWG fees ($4.95), Bitspend fees ($2.50), and overestimated initial price ($1.15), I could have saved $8.60 if I went to the store in person. Actually, I was charged no taxes in this transaction, and I may have been charged 5.5% sales tax on some of these items if I purchased them in person, so maybe the fees are not that bad.
* Just about every time I sent an email to Bitspend, I received a spammy auto-reply message telling me that my order is in queue to be processed, and I continue to get such messages when emailing Bitspend after my order has been completed. This feels really unprofessional. (See edit 1 below for Bitspend's response)
* Having to request a new destination address and MTGox quote if I don't pay within 30 minutes of receipt of the invoice is somewhat irritating. Bitspend told me that this process will be automated soon though, and the 30 minute time limit will no longer apply.
* Bitspend's website indicates a 10-item limit for orders of $50-100. My order was in this price range, and included 15 items, and I was charged $2.50 for my order, so I'm not sure if the item limit was waived, or does not apply to an itemized grocery list. I'm not sure if this belongs as a ""con"" or a ""pro"" or as a ""I'm confused by their website still"". Some clarification would be nice.

**Overall impressions**

I was generally very happy to be able to spend my coins on groceries, and most of the difficulties were tolerable and understandable for a 4-person startup in its second week of operation. Hopefully those difficulties will be ironed out soon though if Bitspend is going to maintain a professional image. I will likely do most of my grocery shopping this way in the future, as long as I can tolerate the turnaround time from order submission to receipt of goods. Most of the delays I experienced can be eliminated now that I know how things work.

**edit 1:** I received a response regarding the price estimation issue and email spam:

&gt;I can absolutely guarantee one thing--If we were charged LESS than whats on the invoice, we will send you a refund of the difference within seconds.  If we were charged less, we did not know it.  I am sure you can understand that we paid the invoice of &lt;redacted&gt;--and we were nto told the price ""might change""!  We will look through our charges this evening and if we DO see that we were charged less we will notifyyou for an address to send the BTC back to.
 
&gt;As far as your email, we had NO IDEA you were getting those emails, they should NOT be going out--that was a test that was cancelled and it seems only a few people for some reason or another have the reply-email issue, our apologies--we;re looking into fixing it now.
 
&gt;Thanks,
Justin

**edit 2:** Justin sent me another email offering to refund the $1.15 misestimation in price, even though he's not sure yet if it's Bitspend or MWG or the grocer who kept the profit.

Yet AG Holder refuses to take the necessary steps to enforce the same laws as those used against the Liberty Reserve group.

http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/banks-above-the-law/

In my opinion, public outcry and anger is the ONLY way to try  to create change.  Occupy wallstreet should have sit-ins at as many HSBC locations as possible, protesting and demanding prosecution of the offending institution.  Close your accounts at the big banks, use a credit union if you need an account anywhere. 

Sad to think the US government has enough trouble on their hands trying to end ""to big to fail,"" just to create a new moral hazard called ""to big to jail.""

Strip them of their US banking license, prevent new business and proceed with closing down their existing accounts and products over time.  

Someone should start a Petition on the White House website demanding the Criminal prosecution of HSBC for their crimes, gather the reddit hoard and start the online movement to have them expunged from the US financial system.

I've been a long time lurker here. Over easter I was trapped at home because my car broke down, so I had some time on my hands to play around with bitcoin data. I have analyzed the data from a blockchain of a few days ago, run it through [znort987's blockparser](https://github.com/znort987/blockparser) and draw some graphs from that with gnuplot.

----

[Bitcon Value of Each Address (Without Empty Addresses)](http://i.imgur.com/djD5OjU.png)

[Just the Top 1%](http://i.imgur.com/RxNyDiD.png)

This shows the value of each bitcoin address from the blockchain that have a non zero amount, sorted by the amount. These are 1,332,713 adresses. In total there are 11,335,753 adresses in the blockchain, so the 10,003,040 empty ones are omitted here.

It's interesting to see that the distribution is even more then log scale, so there are few very rich ones. half of the addresses' balance is just above 0.0001 BTC, 10% of all addresses have an amount over 1 BTC. The 1% of the richest addresses own 80.03 or more BTC.

There is a strange jump around 57%, at this point we are at 45 Satoshi. 46 satosi are highly uncommon (only 41 with that amount), but there are 5545 with 45 Satoshi.

[Bitcon Balance over Time of Last Transaction](http://i.imgur.com/425yR2z.png)

[Just the Top 1%](http://i.imgur.com/iOyKwVf.png)

The x axis shows the time when the last transaction of an address has occured, and the y axis shows its current amount of that address. The darker red a spot, the more addresses are at that point.

The dark red line to the left is at 50 BTC, this was the initial amount awarded to a miner when a block was found. So there seems to be a lot of old addresses lying around with that amount. *UPDATE* The sum of money from The Dark Red Line (50 BTC addresses, date between Jan 2009 and Mar 2011) is about 1.9 million BTC...

Around july 2011 there was for 3 months very high activity around 1 Satoshi to 45 Satoshi, this is also what you see as the strange corner in the other graph. The activity stopped quite suddenly on November 2011.

the red blob on the right side shows there is plenty of activity currently across the whole board, from 0.00001 BTC up to 500 BTC.

Maybe someone here finds this information useful. I don't know much about bitcon's history, but I am sure quite a bit of it can be seen in that graph.

Gox hack has caused quite a bit of discussion about bitcoins weaknesses, especially in regards to security.  

But I want to remind everyone that the failing that occurred here was of a single site/exchange, and the policies/implementation thereof.

If Bitcoin is ever to become truly robust, multiple exchanges with different competing security practices must exist.  A good idea for instance might be exchanges that keep incoming funds in offline wallets and require some delay time/manual intervention for withdraws.

Now all such policies are debatable, but the great value in Bitcoin is in decentralization allowing for competing exchanges with different security policies. 

As much as it sucks to see such a massive heist, Bitcoin is doing it's job perfectly well in this instance, it's performing just like a precious metal that's infinitely easier to transport.

With Bitcoin transactions being non-reversable Bitcoin exchanges should probably be even slower at releasing funds than existing banks/exchanges.  Multiple exchanges should spring up to cater to different the different needs and acceptable risk level of traders, but none should fail so miserably at website security.

I hope the incident helps to bring the light the issue of exchange security, and the market for competing exchanges with a stronger security focus.

There has been a lot of talk lately about changing bitcoin protocol and doing away with asics.  I hope others will join me and speak out against this idea. 

Part of the idea behind bitcoin is that the rules were defined before it was started.  An entire industry has sprung up around this idea and millions have been invested.  Changing the proof of work would essentially alienate the entire mining community and what more, piss every single one of them off royally.  The only possible outcome of this is to destroy bitcoin by making it ok to just change it anytime they want.

Let's get organised! In line with Gavin's ""Don't wait for permission"" philosophy, there's a bunch of things that we could start doing to further Bitcoin in Australia - it seems like we're a disorganised bunch, but I've met a bunch of people at USyd (I work there) who know about Bitcoin and are interested, but there's no real network in Australia, or at least Sydney. (Seems Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane have meetups)

I attended the conference the other week and came away with a few easy things that would really help ground the Australian community, as well as ideas of my own.

1. There isn't a **Sydney meetup**! Anyone fancy fixing that with me?

1. Lindsay suggested that if anyone is interested in starting **local chapters of the Bitcoin Foundation** they should get in contact. I've already sent her an email and she's forwarded that through to Jon who's managing the Chapter stuff. He's not gotten back to me yet, so I might give him a ping. **Is anyone else interested in getting this setup?** I presume you'll need to be a member of the Foundation.

1. I spoke with Josh Rossi about **Satoshi Square** - a public Bitcoin outcry exchange, and I'd love to have something similar running around Australia. I'm not sure what the attendance would be like, but it'd be nice to get some press. I'm currently located in Sydney, but if people would like to organise one in other cities I suggest you mention where you're located in the comments so each mob can get acquainted.

1. I'd love to get a **Cryptocoin pegged to the AUD** distributed. This works on two levels: it gets the usefulness of cryptocoins out there, and it allows for much easier transfer from AUD to BTC. I've done a little research and am trying to conscript a lawyer friend to help once his exams are finished (which marks the completion of his JD). I think the best option at this stage is setting up a not for profit company; keep in mind that in order to remain successful absolute transparency will be needed. I know many of you might not like this idea, but there's no loss if it fails (besides time, really); and I think the potential gains outway the risk.

1. Got an idea? Add it in the comments and I'll edit it in.

Cheers,

Max

If it does, I honestly think it could really shake up the global economy.

I'll look further into bitcoin. Lord knows we could use some new options.

Here's a short list of problems, and proposed solutions.",54mf,164,23,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/htrl9/bitcoin_is_not_userfriendly_heres_a_short_list_of/,"While a lot of attention is being paid to the technical side of the bitcoin protocol, I've noticed a disturbing lack of attention paid to the user experience of the client, and of the ecosystem in entirety. ""It's good enough"" is tossed around a lot. It works, it's functional. Let me say this unequivocally:

**Bitcoin is not even close to ready for use by the general public. The problem is not a lack of exposure. The problem is that it's a pain in the ass.**

I mean no offense to the developers working on the client. I'm a web developer myself, and I have a ton of respect for the complexity of what they're building. But, someone needs to throw up some giant red flags as soon as possible to ensure that development starts to trend more towards usability rather than just functionality.

For the sake of making this discussion easier, I'd like to define a few classes of people:

- *Developers* are the folks working on the client itself, building tools like MtGox to trade bitcoins, and so on.
- *Nerds* are folks like you and I, the majority of people using Bitcoin today. We have a high tolerance for pain and can cope with difficult or unnecessarily complex programs; some of us even enjoy it. We'll spend a week learning the quirks of the system for the sake of using it.
- *Users* are normal people, like your parents or people who watch American Idol. (I'm generalizing, but you probably understand what I mean.) They like things to be easy to use. Truly easy, not easy-after-I-spent-2-weeks-learning-it easy. If something is difficult, they will stop using it. Nerds have a strong tendency to look down upon Users, because we're anti-social and kind of jerks and because Users are great at pointing out when a system that we spent hours building has a stupid flaw that makes it utterly baffling to use for anyone who didn't build it.

Developers are building Bitcoin for Nerds right now, but Users make up the majority of the human race. If we don't start working on making it accessible to Users, and soon, this bubble that everyone keeps talking about is going to burst and instead of being left with an inflated currency but a thriving, stable economy, we'll have a bunch of Nerds who spent a lot of time day-trading and never actually buying anything. Bitcoin needs sellers of goods and services in order to thrive, sellers can't thrive without buyers, and we *need* Users to buy. There aren't enough of us Nerds alone. There has to be growth.

So, without further ado, please refer to this image:

http://mlkshk.com/r/35UI

Here's what I think needs to change.

1. This Address Book hijacks the common usage of the phrase - that is, the place where a User keeps data about their personal contacts. The Bitcoin Address Book is where one keeps a list of their own addresses. For a new User, this is incredibly confusing. There are a number of immediate, unanswered questions: Why do I have multiple addresses? Which one should I keep my money in? I didn't create this address, why is it here?

I'd recommend obscuring the multiple address concept as much as possible. The creation of a new address when sending bitcoins is a clever anonymizing tactic, but very confusing to the User. The client can create as many addresses as it needs to, but the User should see their funds as existing as one cohesive unit unless they explicitly create a new address.

(Side note: if one wanted to determine where someone had sent bitcoins, wouldn't it be easy to research both the addresses used and find out which one had a history and which didn't? If I donate .90 of my 1.00 BCD to the EFF, the public will see .90 go to address ABC and .10 go to my new address XYZ. If they Google both of those, one shows up on the EFF's website, and the other is brand new. Seems sort of frivolous to me.)

2. Calling this ""Your Bitcoin Address"" implies that the User has one address. ""This is *your* address"". In reality, this displays the currently selected address, which doesn't appear to change the UI in any significant way. Copy needs to be changed, at least, but I'd again recommend obscuring the concept as much as possible for the sake of preventing confusion.

3. The balance is, arguably, the most important bit of data in this interface. It should be significantly more prominent. Perhaps the transactions table below should be redesigned (see #9 for more) with the UI border removed and table headers less accentuated, and the current balance displayed in larger text above the Credit column. This would create a visual flow between where a user is now in terms of bitcoin balance, and how they got there.

4. For about a week in to learning Bitcoin, this New button scared the hell out of me. Combined with the ""Your Bitcoin Address"" copy, it creates the implication that you can create a new address - that is, replace your current (singular) address with a new address, theoretically wiping out your old one. The button copy needs to be improved, to better explain what is really going on. ""Create Additional Address"", ""Add Address"", something like that. Less new/replacing, more creating/adding.

5. Why can't I just highlight the address and copy it with Command/Ctrl-C? Visually, it's in a stinking text box. The cursor even changes from arrow to text selector! The fact that I can't copy it is silly. Make the box look different, or remove the button and allow for selecting with the cursor.

6. This doesn't belong at the beginning of the table. Confirmation count is only useful to determine whether or not a transaction is valid, so once it's accepted this data doesn't need to be displayed at all. Probably doesn't ever need to be displayed to Users. What's the difference between 200 confirmations and 300? Practically: nothing.

7. Hid this for the sake of protecting my privacy, but the date format is silly. 24-hour time by default, no way to change it, no indication of the time zone used. There are a number of little quirks like this in the UI. Individually, they're just picked nits, but combined they create enough cognitive stress to make an interface ""difficult"". It just doesn't feel good.

8. Listing the address that received the transaction is silly. Of course I received it with that address, because that's the address I'm currently viewing the transactions for. Show me where it came from.

9. If you're going to use plus signs, you don't need to use Debit/Credit columns. Redundant data, one way or another.

10. I'm twelve years old and what is this. Or if you'd prefer, this data is contextless and meaningless to Users (and frankly, I'm not entirely sure why I should care either). Connections count could be useful as an indicator of client connectivity, but that should be displayed as a binary Connected/Not Connected indicator (red/yellow/green light?) or not at all. Block count isn't important for a User to know unless they explicitly want details on the system's status, which should be buried in a menu somewhere. Transactions count should be with the transactions themselves.

So that's a short list. I didn't even get in to the concept of the ambiguous delay when receiving bitcoins, or why requiring manual Wallet backups is a dangerous idea, or why the Wallet itself is stupidly fragile, but maybe I'll touch on that later.

For now, think about Bitcoin from the perspective of a User. I mean, really think about it. Could your grandmother use it, as it stands today? Why would she? How could she? Bitcoin needs to be accessible, easy, and - dare I say it - *fun* to to use if it's ever going to succeed. Functional isn't good enough, and the discussion about the next steps needs to start now.

And for what it's worth, I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. If you're developing a client or a Bitcoin-related service, I'd really like to stop complaining and do whatever I can to help fix this. Get in touch. (Note: this isn't a plea for work. I have a full-time job, I'd just like to offer anything I can to improve the system.)

Thoughts?

[Edit] Wow, this got significantly more attention than I expected. Glad to see so many people contributing to the discussion; even most of those who disagree with some/all of what I said have pretty good arguments! I am working on a basic GUI wallet as a proof of concept of what I'd like to start seeing, but no guarantees that it will ever actually get finished. I don't have nearly enough free time to devote to it right now, sadly, but I'll do what I can. The post from MtGox today implied that they're working on reducing the difficulty surrounding converting currencies, which would be a huge step in the right direction too.

Also realized I should have included my Bitcoin address!

1. Write a long post.
2. Get a ton of attention.
3. Don't include Bitcoin address.
4. ~~Profit!~~

I have my doubts.,venividivixi,219,78,369,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/15omyz/long_term_success_of_bitcoins_i_have_my_doubts/,"I've been reading a lot about bitcoins lately.  I was about to buy 100 BTC to spend/save but I have one pressing problem about long term stability of the currency.


My main problem with bitcoins is that eventually the number of bitcoins will be fixed at 21 million.  Right now, this is not a problem because the number of bitcoins is always increasing due to mining.  


However, in the long term, hoarding of coins will be a huge problem.  From an investment standpoint, why risk your bitcions (for a better return) if you could get a less risky return by hoarding your coins?  


I have no problems with the fundamental idea of a crypto-currency, however, deflation is extremely problematic once you start leveraging.  If you have an interest rate of say 3%, and bitcoins are stable, then there is no problem.  However, if you have an interest rate of 3%, and the currency is inflating in value by 10% (10% more purchasing power), then you're essentially paying ~13% interest.  This is extremely problematic and in my opinion, makes bitcoin un-adoptable on a larger economic scale.


In order for a currency to be successful, it needs to be constantly inflated, similar to the dollar, but with the same aspects of decentralization.  Inflating a currency disourages hoarding, encourages spending, encourages investing, and encourages leveraging.  These are all the hallmarks of a successful economy.


I'm glad I looked into bitcoin, but unless you had a mechanism to constantly inflate the currency (perhaps through mining), then bitcoin is already dead in my eyes.  The fact that the currency has increased in value is completely irrelevant, because almost nobody has adopted the currency.


Fixed supply is why the Gold standard didn't work, and is why bitcoin will not work.  An economy should never be halted due to the supply of currency, but only by other factors (productivity, monetary policy, taxation, other external factors).


I'd like to hear why I'm wrong, because I'm really intrigued by a digital currency.

The scenario is eerily repeating: User logs on to Mt.Gox or another exchange or online wallet and does some transactions. While they are online, their compromised browser inserts an API key into the service. A few hours later, after logging off, they get an email: ""Your funds withdrawal has completed!"". Their bitcoin is stolen, nothing they can do, gone forever. 

***This will keep happening, again and again. Bitcoin trojans are now common - it makes sense, this is money and easy to steal***


Here are a few things that **DON'T HELP**:

* Strong passwords, because key-loggers
* Two factor, because trojans wait until you log in, then use your session
* Encrypted wallets, because key-loggers
* Encrypted filesystems, because key-loggers
* On-screen keyboards, because screen-loggers
* Wallet backups, because print-loggers, screen-loggers


Here's what **DOES HELP**:

* Move bitcoins away from exchanges as soon as you buy. 
* Only keep the minimum balance for trading
* Keep 95% of your bitcoin OFFLINE in cold-storage
* Use paper wallets or offline computers with Armory
* Generate keys and wallets offline, on clean single-use OS booted from read-only trusted media.

What you should do **ANYWAY**, on clean OS and offline:

* Use strong passwords, because why make it easy for them?
* Use two-factor, because why make it easy for them?
* Use Armory, because why make it easy for them?
* Use printed backups, because why make it easy for them?
* Buy a small home safe and/or rent a safety deposit box
* Spread your bitcoin across multiple storage locations, spreading the risk of loss
* Be very careful with encryption and backups, especially encrypted backups. Lots of people lose/forget their keys or mess up the software and lose bitcoin forever.

I've dabbled around in small amounts of bitcoin here and there that people had given me, but until recently have I never spent or mulled around with them.

I got about 2 bitcoin as payment for a job I did online for someone, and I decided to enact a little experiment. I sent it all to an offline wallet and then transferred it to my blockchain account. I dinked around with Satoshi dice and realized that was kind of stupid, and then I also dinked around with trying to withdraw through Mt. Gox. Since I had set up an account with them and got it verified months ago, I sent about .9 bitcoin to there and tried to withdraw using their wire method. To my dismay I got nailed by a 2000jpy wire fee from mt.gox, followed by a $15 foreign transfer fee from Chase. So, that basically cut my income by half. Enough to make me not want to use Mt. Gox anymore.

Then, while still kind of mad, I went ahead and purchased the humble bundle with bitcoins from my blockchain account. I did not like how long it took to send and receive from blockchain, as I was stuck in the ""verification"" section of the coinbase bitcoin plugin that the humble bundle was using. However, I did decide to check out coinbase and make an account there, and I must say, the fact that there's a $.15 flat fee makes it HUGELY more appealing than Mt. Gox, and even more so that I can just buy with the same bank account via debit too. It sucks it takes 5 business days to get my money into my account, but that's fine.


So, in short. I had a rough time starting out, but, overall it's an excellent alternative to PayPal, and I look forward to offering Bitcoin for my contracting business in real life, and turning as many of my clients on to the idea as possible.

Luckily for me I didn't have any money there at the moment.**

Mercado Bitcoin, the largest – and only – bitcoin exchange in Brazil, has been offline for almost a week now. For the first few days there was no communication, but the owner [just sent an email to all accounts](http://pastebin.com/PZfuZM3X) explaining he was hacked. I haven't seen it posted anywhere in English so I'l do my best to translate what I got.

As far as I understood, someone hacked his ""redeem code"" feature, being able to generate false credits in the system. Then during the night the hacker moved out all his credit into bitcoins, leaving MercadoBitcoin without enough BTC to pay back all the other depositors.

Mercado hasn't revealed how much was robbed or more details than that, but has said he will try to pay back what he can, in that order:

1. Withdraws in Reais that were requested before the attack

2. Deposits in Reais that hadn't been credited yet

3. Current balances in Reais

4. Current balances in Bitcoins

Meaning that depending on how much was left, bitcoin balances will only be given back if he is able to pay back all the money (in Reais) to other creditors, and even that money isn't fully guaranteed.

[I posted about MercadoBitcoin last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1axsml/a_tip_for_bitcoiners_with_brazilian_friends_or/) when I wanted to share the word that Bitcoins in reais where 25% overvalued over other currencies. I assumed it was mostly because of the small amount of sellers but it seems there was also another factor: lack of trust in the exchange.

I doubt this attack is related to this reddit post: this week Exame one big financial magazine in Brazil also had a feature in Bitcoins which mentioned the Mercado. Either this was an opportunistic hack or just a case of worse timing, it seems that the adoption and reputation of Bitcoins in Brazil has received a bad punch.
