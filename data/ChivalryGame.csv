If you liked this guide, I would appreciate if you go over to the steam guide and give it a good rating so that the whole community can see the guide rather than the few that frequent this subreddit.**

Recently, with the flood of new players into the chivalry community, there have been large amounts of tip threads, and inside of each of them I see the same rehashed tips that a player could acquire from spending twenty hours with the game. With this post, I aim to do something different. I will try to create a comprehensive list of advanced tips that I have picked up over the 400 hours I’ve had with the game. I played as a knight and a vanguard, so some of these skills won’t be as useful for MAA or archers. If any other veterans wish to chip in (Tobi, Alice, Hexen, Moose etc.) please do. 

One final note before I start: I am a human, and thus, I can be wrong. Please feel free to point out any inaccuracies, or any points you disagree with and we can have a civil discussion rather than a downvote fest. Also please keep your cries of “exploit!” to yourselves. This thread isn’t a place for that, but rather an objective discussion of valid tactics used in the game.

Here are the topics I hope to cover:

1.	Matrixing

2.	Dragging

3.	Forcing a parry

4.	Going around a parry

5.	Spin Attacks

6.	Advanced parrying

7.	Sidestepping

*****

**Matrixing:**

I’d like to start with matrixing, because I feel that it is such a useful skill post-patch with the removal of the combo feint to parry (and it looks super cool). Matrixing is the manipulation of the player model in order to avoid another player’s attacks. For the most part, it is another line of defense, but it is unique, because unlike your other defenses, such as a shield or parry, it leaves you open to attack your now defenseless opponent at no cost to your stamina. Additionally, your opponent is almost always unprepared for a well performed matrix.
So the question remains: How do you matrix? Essentially, it is like a duck, but instead of bending forwards you are bending backwards. All you have to do is crouch, look at the sky, and turn 90 degrees to either your left or right (the turn is optional but it increases your chances of success). The end result is that your player model is moved farther out of range because you are leaning back, your height is lowered (you can duck this way), and the opponent’s attack becomes slightly off target. This can be further supplemented by either an overhead or a stab attack, which will move your model even farther away and even closer toward the ground. With heavy two handers, like the maul, double axe, or poleaxe your player essentially bends over backwards when overheading!

When should you matrix? Whenever you think you can pull it off successfully; it is a free hit after all.

A few things I’ve realized about matrixing over time are: 

1.	Overheads are really hard to matrix

2.	Stabs are the easiest to matrix

3.	Slashes are somewhere in the middle and better handled by ducks

4.	Daggers are easy to matrix regardless

5.	If you are barely in range, matrix!

These points are somewhat self-explanatory, but I’ll explain them anyways.

1. Overheads hit your feet, which is what makes them nearly impossible to matrix, because even though you are moving the upper half of your model, your feet remain in the same place.

2. Stabs are the easiest to matrix because they only cover a very small area, a straight line directly in front of the opponent, so simply turning to the side can make them miss.

3. Slashes you can matrix by either being very close to your opponent, or almost out of range. It gets harder if you’re not within those two areas because the opponent often has enough time to move their weapon downwards and hit you.

4. Do you hate dagger spammers? Matrixing is for you! Unless the spammer is right next to you he will miss regardless of what strike he uses, allowing you to kill them in one hit (assuming you are a knight or vanguard and they are archer scum).

5. The last point while obvious is very useful. You simply matrix their attack, moving out of range, and attack, moving back into range.

I’m going to give this its own block because I realized I neglected to mention it and it is one of the most important aspects of matrixing: **Attack when you are matrixing.** This statement holds true for the majority of the time. When you matrix, you take a risk by leaving yourself completely open, but you minimize this risk by attacking, because not only do you manipulate your player model further, letting you avoid attacks more easily, but also you give yourself a chance to trade if you fail to avoid the attack.

One final point I have to make about matrixing is that you can use it offensively. One way is to hide your attacks. This applies mostly to the stab. If you bend backwards, like you are matrixing, during your stab, the opponent will barely be able to see the weapon unless if it is huge, allowing you to get off a sneaky attack. Another way is to bait an opponent. You attack from the edge of their range and as they move in thinking they’ve earned an easy hit you matrix their attack and hit them.

This description of matrixing, despite being informative, does not do it justice. [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKgIw2Mupec) made by int | Moose demonstrates its power and versatility well.

*****

**Dragging:**

Dragging is the manipulation of the player view so that your attack lands quicker (accelerated attack), or that it lands slower (delayed attack).

The accelerated attack is the one that a player encounters most often. It is achieved by looking rapidly in the direction in which your attack is going. One famous and hated usage of this mechanic is the lookdown overhead, in which the player looks at the floor as they overhead. There are, however, some disadvantages to this increased speed; you are more likely to miss if the opponent is strafing, and you might hit the opponent’s parry too early if you’re waiting for it to end. Overall, these disadvantages are negligible when considering the bonus speed.

The other lesser used kind of drag, the delay, offers a favorable alternative to using a feint, allowing you to hit opponents despite them parrying. In essence, a delayed attack works by extending the period in which the weapon is released so that it outlasts the opponent’s parry.

The delay is the polar opposite of the accelerated attack. Instead of looking down (or left or right) so that you look where your attack is going, you look in the opposite direction. For example, for the overhead you would look straight up towards the sky. An important thing to note, however, is that by looking up (overhead) or to the side (slash) for a delay, you take your aim off your opponent. If you want your delay to work properly, you have to readjust you view back in the intended direction at the last second so that it hits the opponent.

Delays, like accelerated attacks, vary from weapon to weapon, and between the different types of swings. Therefore, you might not even be able to delay with certain weapons or with certain swings. The swing that works 100% of the time for delaying (with the right weapon of course) is the overhead. You can also delay slashes with difficulty, and stab drags I will give their own little description later on.

Here are certain tips I have amassed for delays over time:

1.	Dragging on the second hit in a combo makes your delay last for much longer

2.	I use #1 with the following combo: Lookdown overhead ? delayed overhead ? lookdown overhead. It’s mixed up timings throw off the opponent completely and allow you an easy kill.

3.	It is hard to hit an opponent with a delay on your first attack

4.	Delaying is not only looking up. For my overheads, I look up, slightly to the right, and then bring it back down and to the left, making an oval rather than a straight line up and down.

Once again I will go through these so that you can understand them better.

1. Your first attack will always be your fastest, and thus counter to the essence of the delay; therefore, delaying on your second (third, fourth, etc.) attack will make it more effective.

2. Best combo in the game.

3. As explained above your first attack is often too fast.

4. This tactic makes your delay last for even longer and allows you to hit even on your first hit. Remember you still need appropriate weapons.

As I said earlier I’m going to quickly address stab drags. These can be achieved in two ways. In the first way you move your attack outwards from the opponent and then back in forming as wide an arc as you can. Imagine a path akin to a curved shot in football/soccer, because it travels in an arc it will cover more distance and thus, take longer, making the timing unexpected. The second way can only be achieved with weapons that have a long stab release: Greatsword, Zwei, Poleaxe, etc. Because these weapons have a long release, you can move around the stab at its zenith before you pull it back it, unlike SoW or Claymore which would pull back in almost immediately. With these weapons, you intentionally miss your attack and then pull it into their side making an L shape. In my experience, the first type of stab drag is delays for less time than the second.

One disadvantage to delays is that they give the opponent more time. In that time, if they’re spamming they can get off another hit, or they can easily avoid delays by sidestepping (I’ll discuss these later)

*****

**Forcing a parry:**

Forcing a parry is all about triggering the opponent’s twitch reflex, making them parry prematurely and leaving them open to an attack. Normally, this is achieved by feinting an opponent, but feints often leave you open to attack, and with their decreased utility post-patch it is now useful to rely on them even less.

So ways to force a parry are just ways to make your opponent panic/uneasy:

1.	Get in the opponent’s face. The farther you are the more comfortable your opponent will feel.

2.	Make sudden movements, looking either all the way up all of a sudden, or all the way down all of a sudden.

3.	Jump

4.	360

5.	Stop a combo mid-way

6.	Kick an opponent and run at them

Most players, especially when they have low health, will fall for any of these easily.

This time #5 is the only one that really needs an explanation. Normally in a fight, people combo as much as possible; if they ever stop it’s usually because they’re too far away. Therefore, it’s almost hard coded into most players’ muscle memory to try to parry after getting hit once or twice. You can take advantage of this by simply stopping your combo even when it seems like you might land another hit.

**General combat**

-When they say look at enemy's weapon tip to block, they mean it. 

-The closer the enemy is to you, the more you have to turn and look in the direction of the attack to block. Otherwise it will go ~~through~~ around your blocks. 

-When someone's stab is going through your blocks, then you need to look more to your left.

-When someone's ''2-hand weapon'' overhead is going through your blocks, then you need to look more upward. Sometimes even 90 degrees upward. 

-When someone's ''1-hand weapon'' overhead is going through your blocks, then you need to look more to your right. 

-When someone's sideswing is going through your blocks, then you need to look more to your left.

-You can swing around parries/shields by facehugging and swinging around enemy's body. 

-You can sidestep around the enemy and land a swing around them because of lag. 

-Sidestep to your right and stab, jump and overhead, or sidestep to your left and overhead. 

-Doing stab - initiate a combo - feint - stab again results in a slightly faster stab than just doing stab - stab. (It was an exploit before, and although it was fixed, this stab speed bonus still exists.)

-Trading means exchanging hits. Enemy hits you and you hit him at the same time. 

-You do not want to trade if enemy has a more powerful weapon than you. For example, enemy has a maul and you have a sword.

-You do not want to trade if enemy is a tankier class.

-You do not want to trade if you are 1 hit away from dying.

-When fighting an enemy 1v1, if you think enemy will feint the next attack, then swing again after your swing was blocked. If enemy feints, he will get hit and be disabled. 
-What this means is: 
You attacked and enemy blocked. If he attacks but feints the first swing, you can land your attack faster if you swung right after you were parried.

-You have to block the attack if enemy starts attack animation right after parrying. They cannot feint out of it.

-If there is a slight pause after their parry, they may feint. 

-While holding your shield up, you can attack without releasing the rightmousebutton/the shield. 

-Sometimes you will get into shield stuck state, where you cannot attack with holding the RMB. To get out of this state, simply block an enemy attack, then while holding RMB, click any attack.

-Looking straight down while doing an overhead results in much faster, almost instant hit.

-You can stab and drag the stab around enemy's body. This trick works best with Brandistock.

-Make it a habit to always sprint when moving forward to attack. You cannot sprint forward after you start attacking, or doing a combo. Always sprint before attempting any attack.

-If enemy misses an attack on you due to distance, more than likely you will miss your attack too unless you sprint forward. 

-Touch (facehug) someone who is sprinting around at least once to stop his movement before attacking. Otherwise, the enemy may be moving too fast for your attack, causing you to miss. 

-Terrain height difference makes the combat different slightly. If you are on a slightly higher bump and enemy is slightly below you, enemy has to look up more to block your overhead attack. 

-When blocking stab, you sometimes get pushed back slightly. Don't attack until you are sure that you can hit the enemy. 

-It's not always your turn to attack after you block an enemy's attack. Don't attack until you are certain you can hit your weapon.

-The longer enemy's weapon is, the more you have to look in the direction of the incoming attack to block it. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Weapon specific**

1-hand weapons - People like to hit around your blocks. Watch out for sidestepping and then... sideswing from your left, overhead from your right, or stab from your left and slightly below. 

2-hand swords - Overhead hits really fast when close. Other swings are easy to block.

2-hand sword with shields - Stab is the most effective. Stab is used often with this setup. Overhead comes from your right unlike when using without a shield. So you have to look more to your right. People tend to not sideswing with this setup, so be prepared to block a feint-to-overhead/stab.

Spear/Fork/Brandistock - Really long range poke. Long stab duration time. Watch out for stabbing away and dragging around. To block this, you need to look slightly in the direction that it's coming from. 

Bardiche/Billhook/Halberd - Long range, but fairly easy to block. Watch out for the stab dragging. Overhead hits super fast when close. 

Maul/Grand Mace - Do not trade hits. Overhead is one shot for the 3 weaker classes. Overhead and sideswing release time is much slower than other weapons so do not block too early. Watch out for overhead-stab, or overhead-feint-stab because the stab preparation animation looks similar to idle state. 

Warhammer - Swing path the same as other 1-handers. Don't trade hits. 
People claim it has longer reach than it looks, but in reality, the weapon has slow swing duration time, so enemy can close in while it is near the end of the swing.

Hatchet - Super fast overhead speed. Experienced players usually overhead.

Dane Axe - Super long range even though it is a 1-hand weapon. Also usually overhead. 

Norse sword - Also super fast overhead speed.

Hatchet/Norse Sword's parry-to-overhead is almost instant. It is ridiculously fast so watch out for that.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Class specific**

- Archer

-If an archer lands a hit on you, you HAVE to block the next attack. You cannot attack him unless you block, because his weapons have much faster attack speed. 

-As an archer, you must facehug an opponent so you do not miss your attack. If you miss an attack, you are as good as dead.

- Man at Arms

-He moves fast and gets in and out of your range quickly if you are also not a MAA. 

-It's better to use faster weapon if you are a knight, but slower weapons are manageable. 

-If you have a longer weapon than what MAA has, use it to your advantage. 

-As a vanguard, you can keep swinging and backpedal to keep him away, but experienced players can dash in and get an attack in during your cooldown. 

-As a knight, always sprint forward to attack. You can queue your attack and if MAA dashes backward, immediately feint then queue another attack. This way, you will be able to hit him without missing. 

- Different types of MAA

One or any combination of the following:

-Slow MAA - Doesn't dash, backpedal only.

-Frenzy MAA - Doesn't stop attacking.

-Back/Forward MAA - Dashing back and forward to get out of your range and annoy you.

-Side dash MAA - Norse Sword MAA. Side dashing to get around your blocks. Look almost 90 degrees to your left to block dash-stab. Look the opposite way for overhead.

-Jump MAA - Hatchet/Dane Axe MAA. After landing a hit on you, this MAA jumps and overheads, screwing up your block.

-Shield MAA - MAA's shield is broad. So stab and sideswing might not work. Overhead is most effective. 

- Vanguard

-Look above for different types of Vanguard weapon tips. 

-Occasionally, you may run into Vanguards that hits, quickly turn 180, run away, queue attack, then come back to hit you. To deal with this:

-Either, wait, stay still and make him miss the attack,
Or sprint forward, following him, but do not attack right away. Block the next one, facehug him, and stop his movement. THEN now it's your turn to attack.

-Vanguard's long weapons sometimes pushes you back with stabs. Don't attack after blocking, as you might completely miss your attack. Instead, wait and block another one while sprinting forward. This will get you into range. Then attack.


- Knights

-Hard to kill unless you get better at feinting or getting around shields. Most of knight's weapons do tons of damage, so do not trade hits. 

-Tower shield - Hard to get stab/sideswing in. overhead is better and easier to land. 

-Smaller shield - Easy to get around with any attacks.

-You have to look more in the direction of the incoming attacks with shields. Otherwise, the attacks may go around your shield.

**When using a shield, watch out for these:**

-Sideswing-feint-Overhead - Makes you to turn your shield to your left to hit from your right.

-Sideswing-feint-Sideswing - Makes you to turn your shield to your right to hit from your left. (Because you thought they were doing sideswing-feint-overhead)

-Overhead-feint-Overhead - Opposite of the above.

-Jump/Overhead-feint-Stab - Tricks you into raising your shield up to get a stab in.

-Sidestep-to-Stab - On your screen, it may look like you are blocking his attack, but the enemy is actually much farther to your left than you think. You need to turn more, almost 50-60 degrees to block this.


- Aiming with Throwables

-At the distance you usually throw your Axe/Knife (Almost double to triple the spear length), Aim roughly the body width away from enemy's current position.",,False,,t5_2vb9k,1353968063.0,,,True,t3_13t7k6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/13t7k6/tips/,

I was playing on map that I had not been on before, when suddenly I found a catapult I could use.  Having never used a catapult, I immediately jump on it and cranked up a shot lined perfectly at the top of some stairs where I though some blue knights would end up.  The second I fired the shot I knew it was going to hit the target.  So as I sat there watching the boulder fly, I see three of my teammates running up the stairs and my sense of accomplishment turned rather quickly into failure.  There was nothing that could be done.  I was stuck there hopeless as I watched my shot land perfectly on top of their heads.  So to those three mason soldiers, I'm sorry.

Lots of fixes to come, we're compiling a list of stuff and sorting for priority at the moment to try and make sure we hit the most important issues for you guys. It has nothing to do with money, we made the game, we will support it as best we can. It has to do with time and us being a small team but we are trying and hiring more programmers as well so hopefully the key issues can be resolved faster now.

**Great news**, we've got the SDK ready for you wayyy sooner than expected, hurrah!! Thanks Crusty!

Everything you need to know will be found here:

https://tornbannerjira.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CHIVCOM/Chivalry+SDK

**Please be sure to read everything!!**

*But to get you started:*

You must own Chivalry to use the SDK. To download it, open up your Steam Library, right click on Chivalry: Medieval Warfare Beta and go to Betas. Choose the SDK beta. You'll then be subject to a ~3-5 GB download. If you ever want to switch back to the normal Chivalry Beta, you'll again be subjected to a large download. This will be true every time you try to switch between the two.
The SDK branch of the dedicated server has the server side of the SDK build.


Anything related to mods and the SDK, as well as support for the SDK can be found here:

http://www.chivalrythegame.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=94

We also have an official IRC channel, so you can get some real time support for the SDK if you should have any questions. Or just come in and say hi !

**Channel**: #tornbanner

Includes objectives: breaking down gates, breaking prison locks, freeing slaves, killing Maric. Easily the best map in the game in my opinion. 

* Snow map(I dont know the name). A snow based map, two sides with a river splitting it with bits of a broken ship. seems to be based on CTF. Includes traps, and giant boulders you can roll down the hills to kill people. 

* The Wall. A map of a giant wall with a break in it, with both sides starting at either end. A lift goes up to the wall. Has a tower. 

* Several small maps for duel mode.

* New game types, Duel mode and CTF, along with the new objectives for maps. 

* Duel mode does *not* work like Mount and blade. It is a challenge system where you are in a lobby where you can challenge other players, or just que for a battle. It takes you into a best of 3 duel. 

* CTF works as you would expect, Two flags. You cant cap when the other team has your flag. you have to wait by the flag to get it back. 

* New weapons for each class. Sling for the archer, Quaterstaff for MAA, Polehammer for Vanguard, and light and heavy flail for Knight

* The sling works as you would expect, longer you wind it up, the more damage it does. a bit OP. contains two types of ammo, lead balls and pebbles. 

* Quaterstaff does low damage but is *so* fast. Two handed

* The polehammer is nothing revolutionary. medium damage, reach and speed it seems.

* The flail is..interesting. Its very cool and feels great to use but it has some problems. The wind ups for both attack animations are the same, so its hard to block. The light flail is really fast and is a bit OP. the physics it uses are really good. 

* there is a new attack direction, left to right, which is used by alt-clicking. 

* no word on optimization, since its in beta. citadel runs slow on even high end systems right now. 

* you can now adjust how long corpses stay, and how many blood stains there are.

Any specific question, just ask

1361530246.0,50,self.ChivalryGame,190kaj,Lets talk about the current balance of the game.,BadLuckBen,63,13,154,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/190kaj/lets_talk_about_the_current_balance_of_the_game/,"What weapons do you think to be overpowered, underpowered, or just right? Same thing for classes. What about certain tactics or maps?

My current views as of last patch:
- In terms of gameplay the game has improved in complexity, this may be in part due to people on the more popular servers having the game down to a science.

- The game is weakest in terms of polish and technical aspects. Most annoying is the server browser and the general lagginess in even local servers. For local servers in games like BF3 and CS:GO I get 25-56 ping most days. Meanwhile on Chivalry I'm lucky to get 80-100, which is even more painful on a game with swords and maces that require even more effort than a gun. This could just be me but I see many high ping players on every server I frequent. 

- I love playing MAA but there needs to be a better animation for the dodge. In first person using dodge actually gets me killed just as often as it saves me. The jarring motion of it can make your camera freak out. When facing a MAA on higher ping they seem to teleport and even though after a while you learn to predict their movements it can still mess you up something awful. I've seen footage of people not having the jarring but I am capable of running the game on high and it still happens so it's probably an optimization issue.

- Vanguards were the most annoying class for me on launch but that spot is now taken by archers. Either the playerbase is becoming better at countering lmb spam or last patch just made them less obnoxious. Of course, I still tend to hate friendly vanguards cause they never seem to care that I'm there and seem perfectly willing to cut me down in order to steal a kill on objective maps where kills aren't the most important thing. 

- As for archers, it seems like every 32 player server has a good 3rd of each side as archers. To me, this game is more about the melee than the rather less well-developed ranged combat mechanics. Drop on crossbows is so low anyone on the defensive side can be a major pain. My main gripe with archers is just how much they slow the game down. To many archers on the defending side leads to the attacking side having more archers than it should rather than opting to use a shield. The Reddit server has an archer limit which is why I like it although I'd prefer it be all TO and skipped the FFA/King/Last team that seem to result in a lot of spectating or leaving. Not many servers have said limit enabled however and sometimes you can see a good 7+ archers per side and you can't get anywhere near the objective if your team refuses to listen to reason. The main reason I think that we've seen this spike is because archery, while not easy to everyone, is simple enough that more people have gravitated towards the class. If the arrow drop and bolt drop was make only slightly more challenging (easier than launch, harder than it is now) we may hopefully see less in larger servers. I've had a good suggestion that you should be less accurate while moving and shooting similar to how CS does things. 

- Knights seem to be in a good spot, although wielding their 2h swords in 1h doesn't seem to be as effective as simply pulling out a falchion or mace as they sacrifice so much reach or damage that it's hard to find a real reason except for getting a shield which also means losing your parry counters. Concerns about the Warhammer being able to 2 shot knights and the bearded axe being to fast have been brought up, the tricky part would be balancing those weapons to keep them viable and not nerf them into obscurity. However, two equally skilled players with one being knight and one being MAA I think the MAA will win more often than the knight because of the aforementioned teleporting and facehugging + overheads. 

- Several maps (*Citadel is the worst offender) tend to fall apart because of bias one way or another either due to map design or the number of people on the map. This is often because the defenders spawn way to close to what they're supposed to be defending while the attacking has to walk for what can feel like miles. In some cases the attackers can also overwhelm the defenders because there's more objectives to defend than what the attackers need to proceed. Stoneshill has this problem, the first objectives has more houses/filthy peasants than the attackers need to kill, therefore making defense difficult if not impossible. The cart push is generally fair although if the defense has a lot of archers and the attacks make the mistake of responding with just as many archers there may not be enough people to push. The last part has the defenders spawning right next to the objective and a truly cowardly person will have the king sit right outside the spawn and in a 32+ game killing him could be near impossible.

- Duel mode is a good addition, to bad so many players want to use cheap tactics in order to win. People pretending to be AFK and wait until you get close to attack, or running and hiding or any other number is cowardly conduct. Also, I don't think it makes sense to allow archers in duels (some servers disable them thankfully but not a ton) seeing as archers don't ""duel."" They sit in the back and shoot at people or throw pointy sticks, and most matches against them involves chasing them around and preforming the serpentine maneuver and if they get a hit they pull out their dagger/shortsword and start spamming stab. While this is counterable I don't think that is what duel mode was intended for. 

- THE BIG ONE: Mouse dragging and exploits. I have no problem with mouse dragging existing, but I do have a problem with the attacks dealing maximum damage when logically they shouldn't because the weapon isn't moving at its maximum velocity if you make it hit earlier or later. I'm no programmer but I suppose a way to fix it would be to have a ""sweet spot"" where each weapons swing has a point in the swing where it deals maximum damage and any point before or after that would deal reduced damage and doesn't flinch. This would mean you could use it to quickly get in a hit but at the risk of taking a full damage hit. As for ""tactics"" such as combo feinting and downward stabbing at shields should simply be removes as they are exploits. Supposedly Torn Banner is aware of combo-feinting and will fix it at some point.

Overall, I'd say polish and the servers/server browser are the biggest issue followed by map balance. Many of my other issues could be solved if more servers had things like archer limits or players just using some common sense. Still one of my favorite games currently on the market and I hope to see it continue to improve. I would also like to see the Official TO Servers have an archer limit to avoid over a third of the attacking side having archers sitting right outside of spawn only shooting at people who are nowhere near the objective. 

TL;DR: It's a discussion on game balance, chances are if you're reading this you'll care enough to take a few minutes to read and post your own thoughts, keep it civil.

1364342594.0,47,self.ChivalryGame,1b2sgr,State of the Game - current problems and ideas,snoee,55,8,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1b2sgr/state_of_the_game_current_problems_and_ideas/,"I've logged about 65 or so hours in this game, with about half in duel, and I really, really love it. But, as great as it is, there are some issues which I think most people would like to see addressed, and I felt like seeing what you guys think. My thoughts are influenced by a realism and dueling perspective but these are what I see as the biggest problems and my ideas on what to do about them, besides the obvious mechanic bugs.

**Feinting**

Probably the most controversial mechanic in the game. A lot of people feel it turns the game into chance instead of tactics. Solution:

* Reduce the parry cooldown to the point where feints can be parried
* Reduce the stamina usage of feinting

This way, getting feinted and messing up a parry doesn't mean you get hit, but it does mean you've just burned a lot of stamina - a burn for parrying the first time, a burn for parrying the second time, and another burn for deflecting the attack. Feinting would become a way to wear your opponent down.

**Facehugging**

The ability to facehug doesn't really make sense realistically since fights would turn to grappling very quickly at that range, not to mention the actual game play issues it presents. So I say:

* Add a shove mechanic with a very low range that pushes enemies back and breaks their combo
* Change mace/spear/axe weapons to have separate hitboxes for their handles and their heads
* Add damage gradients throughout an attack

Most of the time - especially with weapons like the dane axe and the morning star - you have to block by facing the tip of the weapon, but you actually get hit by the shaft. Getting hit by the shaft of a weapon should do minor blunt damage and maybe cause flinching, but to deal the full amount of damage (and this includes long weapons like the spear and halberd) you have to be wary of your distance to your opponent.

Damage gradients would make attacks do different amounts of damage depending on when in the swing it connects, so the least at the very beginning and end, and the most at the middle where momentum is highest. This means that someone facehugging with a norse sword would do less damage since their attack would connect before its ""peak"", and someone hugging with a zwei or spear would have to keep a decent distance for their attack to deal its full damage.

**Overhead leaning**

Weapons like the bearded axe and the vanguard swords benefit immensely from looking at the ground while doing an overhead. The bearded axe, for instance, connects almost instantly if you do this while facehugging. The damage gradient suggestion under facehugging would take care of this issue.


I know it's somewhat pointless to post a thread like this since the chances of influencing the devs are pretty damn low, but it's good to think about at least. I think these are pretty reasonable and non-drastic changes that wouldn't feel at all out of place in the game we have now.

- Stamina does not regenerate while taunting, however health does.

- Switching weapons while taunting will end the taunt

- Shields block ranged attacks even when on your back

- Stamina regenerates faster while crouching (I can't confirm if health does this as well)

- Stamina will not regenerate while changing weapons, or while picking up torches

- If you are stuck, use kick/shield bash, it should unstick you

- ~~Only~~ his death, parrying his attack, and kicking before the attack lands will stop a vanguards charge attack.  [Credit: ClassicHitler](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/19tke2/a_few_tips_you_might_not_have_known/c8r6qyd)

**Improvements/Additions/Tweaks**

-After being deflected from hitting walls/ground/environment, you're now unable to parry until you return to idle. An exception is made for destructible objects, such as the cage locks on Citadel or walls protecting the royal family on Darkforest.

-You can no longer follow up with a combo if you're struck while in release.

-Fists and Piercing/Blunt weapons now explode heads properly.

-Fists now use normal weapon tracers and deal appropriate hitbox damage, making them more precise to hit with and less forgiving - you can now duck and sidestep punches properly. Let the tavern brawls truly begin!

-Further improvements to block detection, eliminating some more edge cases of attacks going through parry boxes when a player's block was properly aimed.

-Blocked the use of certain mildly exploitable UE3 console commands.

-Shield toggle is now consistent between all weapons - either pressing 3 or the number of the weapon (I.E. 1 for primaries 2 for secondaries) will toggle the shield, where previously the behavior varied with some weapons.

-Mute commands now mute text as well as voice.

-Perspective lock and free camera now only apply to living and dead players respectively, not spectators.


**Bugfixes**


-Fixed flinch sometimes causing ""ghost"" attack animations to play rather than the flinch animation.

-Fixed a bug/exploit causing players without stamina to be able to daze others who weren't out of stamina.

-Fixed server browser issues introduced in Patch 1.

-Fixed flinch not applying to dazed players.

-Fixed an issue causing siege weapons to appear to fly into the air when a player enters one and jumps.

-Fixed a bug causing catapults to fire point blank when double clicking.

-Fixed players who join spectator still being displayed as being on the team they were previously on.

-Fixed blood particles from dismembered limbs spawning incorrectly.

-Fixed an issue causing players to spawn with the wrong loadout when switching from a team, to spectator, and then to the opposing team.

-Fixed being able to sprint with a bow or crossbow ready to fire.

-Fixed being unable to sprint with throwing weapons and the sling ready to fire.

-Fixed the missing return button from weapon select.

-Fixed both arrow types being displayed as bodkins in weapon select.

-Fixed being unable to throw a torch while sprinting.

-Fixed spectating players who are using a ballista forcing the ballista to rotate.

-Fixed being unable to queue javelin throws.

-Fixed spawning with a random weapon equipped.

-Fixed a case where the setname command wasn't being blocked properly.


**Map Changes**


**Citadel:**


-Added awnings to first mason spawn to prevent archers from firing at the ballistae.

-Removed collision from damage states on the locks that were registering player strikes.

-Removed Balista after completion of first objective

-Minor spawn tweaks on final objective for attackers

-(Sound)Made malric must not fall/attack the throne room commander vo attacthed to end of statue fall, was previoused bugged and starting when sale cage pens came down



**Hillside:**


-Trebuchet 3 message should display correctly now.(Was showing trebuchet 4)


**Stoneshill:**


-Multiple collision and stuck spot fixes

-Fixed an exploit spot for archers in which they could hide inside the gatehouse mesh.

-Fixed a spot near the mason spawn where players could get on top of the rocks and were hard to access.

-Smoothed over the landscape in areas.

-Moved the ammo crate to the front of the Throne Room to reduce archer nesting around the king.

-Patched up some mesh holes/overlaps

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Experimental**


*These changes will not be going into the live patch, but since they're already complete, we want to have them on the beta so players can give feedback on them while we work on other Patch 2 tweaks:*

**Feint changes** - first pass only, subject to change:

-The last .15 of an attack windup is unfeintable.

-Feinting from a combo has a .1 longer recovery.

-Attacks made after a feint cannot be feinted.

**Other:**

-Modified some things about dodge that should make it smoother and less buggy - this needs extensive testing so we can be sure it addresses the problem without introducing new issues.

-Hitting destructible objectives no longer counts as a miss, and thus does not drain stamina - need to be sure it doesn't make attacking too easy on Citadel.

Before the patch I was doing fairly well, never really being afraid of going into a 1vs1 with anyone, but now I just can't seem to hold my own any more.

The timing feels off on pretty much everything, it takes forever after finishing a strike before you can put your block/parry up, and it takes a long, long time after blocking/parrying that you can strike again. Even when you're just dropping your shield to strike it takes a long time, even when the enemy hasn't hit you. 

Also while it doesn't state it in the patch it feels like they made the reach of the broadsword shorter. I miss all the time now whereas before it wasn't unusual for me to have a 90%+ accuracy. This could be coupled to the reset of the FOV setting, but I put it back to where I had it (110 degrees) so it should be the same. It looks sort of the same too so I don't think it's that.

Shortly after I chased an Archer atop a building and kicked him off / fell onto him and punched him to death, the complaints were constant from more then a couple people in the server. Then I got a double kill from a leaping punch, and the demands for a votekick started.

I'm new to this game still. I've only clocked about 5-6 hours, 4 of which came last night. Are fists *really* actually that effective, or was it just a case of sour grapes from the bad players that I was haymakering into a bloody pulp?

While we have been working a lot this week, there’s really not a whole lot to say in terms of updates, but this is what I’ve got!

* The balance and mechanics update on the beta patch is going well. We’ve been getting a lot of good feedback from the community and we want you to know that we DO listen! We have started up a Balance Testing Council, which will have representatives from both the NA and EU scene to help us go over everything related to the balance and mechanics of the game. 

* In regards to the next beta update, we’ll have it out for you on Monday. With the new council, we wanted to get as much out of it as possible, so we weren’t able to get a release out today.

* Customization will be coming soon!  It’s looking really good so far! You will be able to customize your background pattern, colours (within team range) and emblems + helmets.

* After the current beta is all done and released, we’ll be focusing on bringing the SDK + tools out to you. Thus, it will be released in the beta for you to test out after the balance and mechanics are all taken care of. Again, it will be released in the beta first and foremost. It’s happening guys! :)

See you next week!

I made a post about this on the chivalry forums, but the modding sections aren't browsed as often so I figured that posting it here would get it a few more views. In my free time I've been making these, which could be imported to the SDK and used as visual replacements for the knight swords. Except for the messer (which I think will need to be redone), they're properly proportioned. I tested out importing and rigging one of them, and it's not terribly hard - although making the materials is a little bit unnecessarily complicated. Their polycount is a little bit higher than the vanilla weapons, but not to such an extreme that it would have a negative impact on performance, I'd think. 

I'm not super happy with all of these and constantly see little things that could be improved. But if you guys like them, I would gladly do more and would love some help getting them working before the workshop opens officially.

1359157885.0,35,self.ChivalryGame,17ac96,Rather than complain about new players. Let's help them by compiling a list of 'pro' tips!,Mad-Dee,42,7,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/17ac96/rather_than_complain_about_new_players_lets_help/,"So, you just picked up Chivalry during the sale, or you're just playing for the weekend. Great! Welcome to the game! The tutorial is the best thing you can play through first, but there's a lot of really useful tips you are not initially taught. And a lot of ettiquete that is in no way written down formally. I'll do my best to give you some tips that really helped me out.

Consider upvoting this for the sake of getting it seen! (I'm not getting karma from it!)


* Teamkilling by mistake happens. Learning how to veer your swings AWAY from people can make it happen less and if it DOES happen, saying 'sorry' is important to keep people from getting upset.

* Swings, jabs AND overheads can pass THROUGH targets. Use this to your advantage by trying to stab THROUGH foes, but watch for friendlies when you swing.

* Blocking isn't just about getting your guard up. You have to keep the TIP of the foe's weapon in roughly the centre of your screen for it to be blocked. If your enemy is close to you, this may involve turning using your mouse to block properly. An overhead attack from a longsword may require you to look 90 degrees UPWARD in order to fully block it!

* If someone IS blocking repeatedly, a well placed overhead strike from close range can easily reach OVER their shield, long weapons make great guard breakers if you're brave enough to get up in their face!

* Kicking cannot be blocked and being kicked will stagger you. If you think someone's about to put the boot in against you, back up!

* If you're a slower class and your enemy is running away, KEEP YOUR CURSOR ON THEM. A knight who keeps his cursor red by aiming it at a fleeing Man-at-arms can gain a speed boost as they chase, enabling a slow knight to skewer a much faster class through the chase.

* Kicking someone requires you to enter the console. Votekick &lt;name&gt; followed by Confirm &lt;number&gt;. It always helps to state why BEFORE you initiate the kick in order to get people to vote.

* Swinging a longer weapon, such as a spear, will cause the attack to strike targets even out of your field of view. Be careful when you swing as you might hurt friendlies who are rank-and-file beside you!

* A shield that you are not using can still offer impressive protection. If you're concerned about being shot in the back, bring a shield and don't USE it to offer your spine some arrow-protection!

* In team objective, the blue marker will show you what to do, if you can't see it, you might have hit 'h' and accidentally hidden it from view!

Well, I used to.

After spending some time with the relatively new block, 1v1 in larger battles are just not fun. Both me and my opponent can block any strike that we can see coming, and the punishment for mistakes are much lower than they used to be. This leads to drawn out battles, even when playing against rookies, which again leads to getting backstabbed before ending the battle. 

TB lowered the skill ceiling with the altered block, and I no longer jump in a game whenever I'm bored because of it. Experimenting with weapon speeds, damage and length is fine. We adapt. This new block is just frustrating.

**EDIT: Since my little rant hit front page, in the case that a developer actually sees this, I think you should take a look at the block mechanic. Experiment with something new, who knows, it might hit bullseye. The old would also be accepted with open arms, I don't think I EVER heard anyone complain about it. This weapon is OP, that class is OP, blocking was just blocking, block too early and you die.

After a couple friends and I decided to pick up this game during the holiday sale, we were promptly confused by the documentation regarding creating a dedicated server.  After scrounging the internet for a couple weeks, I have managed to successfully set one up.  In hopes that I will save the time of at least a couple people looking to play a quick private match with there friends I have decided to make a basic guide to setting up a server.

**2. Port Forwarding**

You will need to port forward ports.

* 27015
* 7777
* 7778  

If you are unable and/or unaware of how to do this, look towards [this site](http://portforward.com/) which has tutorials teaching how to port forward on various routers and firmware.

**3. Dedicated Server Tool**

The dedicated server tool provides only the necessary files needed to host a dedicated server.  While it is possible to run a server using the main game files, I would recommend you download the tool as steam interpreted me doing this as running two instances of the game.  You can find [the dedicated server](http://i.imgur.com/lZGvD2t.png) in [the tools tab of your game library](http://i.imgur.com/65Hjhbd.png).  The server should download in the following directory.

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\chivalry_ded_server

**4. Configuring Server Files**

The server config files are located in the ""Config"" directory shown below.
    
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\chivalry_ded_server\UDKGame\Config

Now open the ""PCServer-UDKGame.ini"" file in your preferred text editor and scroll to the section titled ""[Engine.AccessControl]"".  If this is not already present, add it to the end of the file.  To add a server admin password, add the line ""AdminPassword=####"".  For a game password, add ""GamePassword=####"".  Your config file should now look something like this.

    [Engine.AccessControl]
    IPPolicies=ACCEPT;*
    bAuthenticateClients=True
    bAuthenticateServer=False
    bAuthenticateListenHost=True
    MaxAuthRetryCount=8
    AuthRetryDelay=8
    AdminPassword=iamunoriginal
    GamePassword=thisismypassword

To set the server name and message of the day, scroll down to the ""[Engine.GameReplicationInfo]"" section.  Add or change the lines ""ServerName=####"" and ""MessageOfTheDay=####"".  It should look something like this.

    [Engine.GameReplicationInfo]
    ServerName=5paceManSpiff's Super Happy Fun Time Server
    MessageOfTheDay=Merry HumpDay!

If you would like to change the map rotation, scroll to the ""[AOC.AOCGame]"" section and replace all lines starting with ""Maplist="" with the maps you would like to put in rotation.  For example, if I only wanted to play free for all on the arena, the only line starting with ""Maplist="" would be this.

    Maplist=AOCFFA-Arena3_p

**5. The Batch File**

There should be a .bat file in the dedicated server directory titled ""start.bat"".  If the file isn't present, create a new text file and name it so.  Right click on it and select edit.  There should be two lines that look something like the following.  If the file was not generated, paste these two lines in.

    CD ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\chivalry_ded_server\Binaries\Win32""
    UDK.exe AOCFFA-Arena3_P?steamsockets -seekfreeloadingserver

The second line launches the dedicated server executable, which takes a couple command line arguments such as the starting map, which in this case is ""AOCFFA-Arena3_P"".  This can be interchanged with [any other map in the game](http://chivalry.wikia.com/wiki/Maps).  You can also add the ""-maxplayers=##"" argument to set the maximum amount of players.

**6. Starting the Server**

Simply double click the ""start.bat"" file to load up the server.  Then either find your server in the server browser in game, or open up the console by pressing the grave key (the key above tab) and type ""open 127.0.0.1"" which should load you right into the game.

It's FAR too easy for people download Cheat Engine and press 2 buttons to speedhack and it's hard to catch them when they are speed hacking by only 10%. It's like the Chivalry communities dirty secret. No one wants to toss out hackusations willy nilly and sound like a butthurt noob that just has been getting smashed all day by a superior player. 

What bugs me the most is the constant paranoia. ""Did I lose that fight because I made a mistake in timing/parrying or was the fight rigged to begin with?"" When I play I try to maintain the thought the no one is hacking, but sometimes it's hard to not be suspicious of some players. This sucks because it takes away from the respect a player can earn from being skilled. ""Is he level 47 because he has a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and has some crazy moves or has he been playing for a month with a speedhack?"" There are times when your attacks seem to be molasses compared to certain opponents. A lot of this can be explained away with counterattack speed, flinch mechanics, lag etc but the ease at which a person can download a cheat program and press a button really bugs me and is proof enough that cheating is in fact rampant in Chivalry.

After a few minutes more of playing I start noticing all the times I would hear “no”  etc, so I decide to help Alice out and defend him from attackers.  I would attack anyone that came close and would not leave Alice’s side for the most part.    Alice and I owned that little gate area, let me tell you what.  We would do our battle shouts at the scum running around the arena, and occasionally we’d dance around, generally being silly.  It was some good times.

Here are some performance tweaks that I've found actually work.,evolveasaddict,41,7,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/17mopm/slow_game_weak_processor_here_are_some/,"This game crushes processors, even good ones. If you find some maps running better than others, servers with more players killing your framerate, big fights turning your game into a slideshow: this thread is for you.

Excuse the shitty editing - I can't seem to get it right, but you should get the idea.

Go into your UDKEngine.ini file located in Documents\My Games\Chivalry Medieval Warfare\UDKGame\Config, and ctrl + F ""maxchannels"". You should see (the unedited version of) this:


[XAudio2.XAudio2Device] 

*MaxChannels=32* 

*CommonAudioPoolSize=109*
 
*MinCompressedDurationGame=3*


IIRC, the defaults were 64, 0, and 1. But yeah, switch them to that. 

Then right below those values:


[ALAudio.ALAudioDevice] 

*MaxChannels=32* 

*CommonAudioPoolSize=109*
 
*MinCompressedDurationGame=3*


Do the same thing.

Also in the SystemSettings.ini, I found this one really helps as well:


*OnlyStreamInTextures=True*


If anybody doesn't see a big improvement from these tweaks, PM me for a few more you may have already heard of. I've found them to be far less effective, but they just might to the trick for some.

If you're wielding a goddamn broadsword and I can get in close enough to fist you, then you're doing something wrong. If you can't block one of my fists between the two punch rotation and kill me with an actual weapon, then you're doing something wrong.

The main complaints seem to be that fists do ""too much damage"" and have ""too much of an OP stagger effect"", but honestly I think they do piss-poor damage and the stagger effect is the only way you can viably use them at all.

This sort of talk is aimed to help newer players learn and help veterans refine their skills.

So, let's talk about the riposte.

The tutorial fails to mention the riposte.  It teaches things like feints and purposely missing your first attack in order to connect with the second, but there is no mention of a riposte.

So, what is a riposte?

A riposte within Chivalry is a quick counter attack off a parry.  It is normally used to catch your opponent off-guard with a quicker strike after parry.

How do I riposte?

Basically, a riposte can be preformed by using a stab or overhead immediately after parrying.  The wind-up for the riposte strike is shortened thus dealing the strike quicker.

What's the difference between a riposte and any other attack after a parry?

Well, the riposte strikes much quicker than a normal attack after parry while dealing the same amount of damage.  This makes fights more complex and more deadly.

Obviously, this description of the riposte is short and lacking specifics so please  post questions and more detailed specifics about the riposte maneuver.

I want to encourage talk of this mechanic!",Discussion,False,,t5_2vb9k,False,,Agathapng,True,t3_1k4v0o,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1k4v0o/riposte/,

If you are like myself who came from a strong FPS background, you may be used to having a button for quick-swapping between two weapons!  Being an archer, I find this invaluable in being able to quickly swap between weapons via a single key.

In my case, I like Q as my hot-key to mimic many other FPS games.  So, simply bind the same key to both your primary AND secondary weapon switches, and BAM!  Easy dagger access for close encounters.

If you are interested in giving this a whirl, check out [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/NsD0xHt.png) to get it all setup! (Of course, you can change Q to be any other key you wish.)

I'll start with a couple I saw playing last night.

- A lot of newer players will tell you TK is part of the game, it is to a degree, but you should atill try hard to avoid it. Use mostly stab attacks if you are in a tight mele and say sorry in chat if you TK someone, this will prevent you front getting kicked from the server in many cases and keep a happy environment.

- If someone is TKing you a lot, ask them to stop, and vote kick them if they don't.

- If you're playing maa, don't dodge 6 times before you even get to an enemy, you will run out of stam and die. 

- If you are playing an objective match and there are already 5 archers on your team, you might want to pick a class that can run in and help an objective instead of playing another archer.

- If you are arching, you can stand fairly close to the fights, don't be scared, there is no point taking hail mary shots from your spawn. 

- Dont troll or complain to much in chat, it can get you kicked pretty easily.

- Starting with a knight for the extra HP or a class with a shield to avoid parry mistakes can be a good place to begin.

- Join a clan or invite your friends, playing with others you know is hilarious and great fun.

This is confirmed during the credits, as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/04BczIc.png).

Lately, I've been trying to find all of them, but I've been stuck on 4 maps for a long time, so I gave up and decided to ask for help. However, none of my friends could find these either, so I'm taking it to the next level.

Reddit: I want you to find these 4 cows:

* ~~**Citadel:** It's a huge map, so it's like finding a needle in a hay stack.~~ WalrusOnWheels nailed it.

* ~~**Dining Hall:** I've scouted the castle perimeter but didn't find anything. i even went behind the mountains, thinking the devs would be evil enough to put the cow there, but nothing. There's a weird black and white ""thing"" inside the wall, above the fireplace, But it doesn't look like it's that.~~ Thanks medi_retla for making me feel stupid

* **Cistern:** Fuck this map. I've been searching on it for hours, and nothing. And it's a small map too. There is a way to leave the inside, in case anybody wants: Go to the middle of the map and look to the side where there's light coming in. Now look to the tunnel on your right. On theright side of the arc that starts the tunnel, there is a place that you can go throught. I know my explanation sucks, but if you fly in there for a while you'll find it.

* **Throne Room (normal/XL):** Doesn't matter which one, because it seems like they are both the same. You can also leave the small version by gong throught the big sphere on the center.

Thanks for your attention, and I hope you guys can help me :)

Update:

* **Stonehill:** People found 2 but I realized I'm missing another one. I could swear there was a cow on Stonehill near the gate where the ram comes from. Looks like I'm just crazy.

But now that everyone can look different, people are choosing darker colors and in most levels, the classes and teams start to blend together. Dark blue looks black in most parts of Chivalry (seeing as it's a darker game) and black can be chosen as well. When there's a larger battle taking place, unless your reticle is on your opponent, it's hard to tell what team they're on.

I've had some people agree with me, and others tell me to turn my brightness up... but I'd quite like the game to not look like someone watered the colors down to tell. Is there an option to turn customization off? (so everyone looks the same on just your end?) I'm all for customization on FFA and Duels, but in team play it's confusing for me.

Ideas inside!,logancmc,43,16,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1h9bnu/this_game_needs_4v4_team_objective_maps_what_do/,"I have long been saying that Chiv, once fully polished and without bugs, will one day be a very competitive tournament game. However, as it stands, there just isn't the perfect mode wherein something like this can grow. I have recruited several friends to start playing with me, but once it comes down to it, there is no game mode where we can really feel like we are working together. The TO maps now are just too large for small team rounds to make any sense.

I believe that 4v4 TO maps should become a game mode so that groups of friends can play against each other. It makes sense seeing as there are 4 classes, and it could really allow for some strategy to start making its way into the game. Team class combination would be vital (you shouldn't be able to change your class once you're in the game) and the maps could be a lot of fun.

Imagine a map where, for example, Agatha is tasked with escorting the king (or prince, or queen, or whoever) out of the castle while it is being raided. We're talking about 4v4 here, so 4 Mason would at the same time be trying to stop the Agatha. The first ""phase"" of this map would be getting the king out of the castle -- navigating its labyrinthine corridors while fighting off the Mason. Meanwhile, the castle could be burning to the ground, adding another dangerous element to the situation (this could even somehow be interactive for the Mason, giving them a strategical advantage if done correctly).

Once the Agatha have escaped the castle walls with their king, they must light a distress Pyre to signal for a ship pickup. This is Phase 2 and is a full-on beat down as the two teams directly collide over a key location since Mason must prevent Agatha from lighting this beacon and the Agatha must protect their king.

Once the beacon is lit and the ship docks, we get to the wickedly fun Phase 3, where Archers become a key role for both sides. When the Agatha ship docks, any players still alive and not waiting to respawn will be able to board it, including Mason. Dead players, in Phase 3, will spawn on their own ship, so Agatha will spawn on the ship with the king and Mason will spawn on a different ship tailing the Agatha ship. Mason will be able to kick ladders from their ship to the Agatha ship and cross; meanwhile, Archers from both sides will be lighting the opposite ship up with arrows. Agatha are still trying to protect their king. Obviously, this part will be need to be balanced perfectly (Agatha having the king gives them a clear advantage). I picture a cannon on one or both of the ships. The game ends when Agatha defends their king until they get to their remote fortification, or when the Mason kills the king.

I just wrote this idea up from scratch in about 30 minutes, so there are bound to be flaws (feel free to offer suggestions/improvements, I'd love to hear them and will edit my post once I receive feedback!) The point I'm trying to make is **4v4 could be a hell of a lot of fun.** I want this mode to happen. What do you guys think?

**TL;DR:** 4v4 maps could be a lot of fun and contain shenanigans involving ships and teamwork. It could also push Chiv toward being a truly competitive team game with both strategy and skill required.",,False,,t5_2vb9k,False,,,True,t3_1h9bnu,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1h9bnu/this_game_needs_4v4_team_objective_maps_what_do/,

It contains a whole host of new fixes and tweaks to the previous combat mechanics changes, as well as the first pass of balance changes aimed at rebalancing weapons around longer windups and faster releases, as well as improvements to some weapons that were long overdue for buffs.

**Bug Fixes:**

* Dodge cooldown should work properly again (1 second delay before being able to dodge again)
* Sprint no longer causes you to slide forward during a dodge or crossbow reload.
* Fixed a bug causing Light Crossbow to become unable to fire.
* Rank limits will now recognize rank 0.
* Blocked access to some console commands allowing you to switch weapons when you shouldn't be able to.
* Flinch animation was playing server-side for players struck by a teammate, overriding their real animation.
* Respawn timer will no longer force you to the next spawn wave if you have class or weapon select open at the end of your current spawn wave.
* No longer stunned if your shield blocks a projectile while out of stamina.
* Fixed a server request allowing hackers to spawn as the king class.

**Tweaks/Improvements:**

* Better kick/shield bash hit detection against enemies on higher or lower elevation.
* Bonus stamina regeneration from crouching removed; normal stamina regeneration rate increased by 40% of previous crouch stamina rate.
* Dodge stamina cost increased by 5.
* End of windup feints have a .6 recovery for one-handers and .5 for two-handers.
* Being flinched or having your attack deflected will now prevent you from starting to sprint again for 1 second.
* Quick kick costs 5 less stamina than slow kick, made slightly faster, and now works with shields as well.
* Enemy-specific collision radius reduced by 20%.
* Decreased visual size of buckler for first person Flail animations (other buckler animations will be fixed as well).

-After being deflected from hitting walls/ground/environment, you're now unable to parry until you return to idle. An exception is made for destructible objects, such as the cage locks on Citadel or walls protecting the royal family on Darkforest.

-You can no longer follow up with a combo if you're struck while in release.

-Fists and Piercing/Blunt weapons now explode heads properly.

-Fists now use normal weapon tracers and deal appropriate hitbox damage, making them more precise to hit with and less forgiving - you can now duck and sidestep punches properly. Let the tavern brawls truly begin!

-Further improvements to block detection, eliminating some more edge cases of attacks going through parry boxes when a player's block was properly aimed.

-Blocked the use of certain mildly exploitable UE3 console commands.

-Shield toggle is now consistent between all weapons - either pressing 3 or the number of the weapon (I.E. 1 for primaries 2 for secondaries) will toggle the shield, where previously the behavior varied with some weapons.

-Mute commands now mute text as well as voice.

-Perspective lock and free camera now only apply to living and dead players respectively, not spectators.

**Bugfixes:**

-Fixed flinch sometimes causing ""ghost"" attack animations to play rather than the flinch animation.

-Fixed a bug/exploit causing players without stamina to be able to daze others who weren't out of stamina.

-Fixed server browser issues introduced in Patch 1.

-Fixed flinch not applying to dazed players.

-Fixed an issue causing siege weapons to appear to fly into the air when a player enters one and jumps.

-Fixed a bug causing catapults to fire point blank when double clicking.

-Fixed players who join spectator still being displayed as being on the team they were previously on.

-Fixed blood particles from dismembered limbs spawning incorrectly.

-Fixed an issue causing players to spawn with the wrong loadout when switching from a team, to spectator, and then to the opposing team.

-Fixed being able to sprint with a bow or crossbow ready to fire.

-Fixed being unable to sprint with throwing weapons and the sling ready to fire.

-Fixed the missing return button from weapon select.

-Fixed both arrow types being displayed as bodkins in weapon select.

-Fixed being unable to throw a torch while sprinting.

-Fixed spectating players who are using a ballista forcing the ballista to rotate.

-Fixed being unable to queue javelin throws.

-Fixed spawning with a random weapon equipped.

-Fixed a case where the setname command wasn't being blocked properly.

**Map Changes**

**Citadel:**

-Added awnings to first mason spawn to prevent archers from firing at the ballistae. 

-Removed collision from damage states on the locks that were registering player strikes.

-Removed Balista after completion of first objective

-Minor spawn tweaks on final objective for attackers

-(Sound)Made malric must not fall/attack the throne room commander vo attacthed to end of statue fall, was previoused bugged and starting when sale cage pens came down

**Hillside:**

-Trebuchet 3 message should display correctly now.(Was showing trebuchet 4)

**Stoneshill:**

-Multiple collision and stuck spot fixes

-Fixed an exploit spot for archers in which they could hide inside the gatehouse mesh.

-Fixed a spot near the mason spawn where players could get on top of the rocks and were hard to access.

-Smoothed over the landscape in areas.

-Moved the ammo crate to the front of the Throne Room to reduce archer nesting around the king.

-Patched up some mesh holes/overlaps

**Experimental:** (not getting released this patch, but still experimenting and gathering feedback... no noobs allowed!)

These changes will not be going into the live patch, but since they're already complete, we want to have them on the beta so players can give feedback on them while we work on other Patch 2 tweaks:",News,False,,t5_2vb9k,1366279502.0,,,True,t3_1cliqk,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1cliqk/cu1_patch_15_beta_release_candidate_1_its_fucking/,

*Faced with a new and powerful enemy, the Mason Order and the Agatha Knights must combine their forces to defeat an onslaught of demonic proportions.  Together, they must overcome the instruments of Lucifer, the coming of the Revelation, the* ***LIVING DEAD***.

This would change the game a bit.  It wouldn't become a game no longer about defeating equal opponents on a battlefield of skill, but about outlasting an incoming stream of thousands of sprawling hellbeasts.  Decapitations would be the only way to kill, as anything else would only slow a zombie down.  This creates interesting new situations and some problems.

.

.


NEW COOL STUFF:

* Sieges.  Now the Ballista and Catapult can be used to their full effect all the time, instead in only a few situations.

* Teamwork.  Desperate times call for interesting cooperation.  Formation fighting would reign king.  Knights form a Wall of Shield, Crossbowmen lay down a ring of Pavises, Vanguards spin around, and Men-at-Arms thrown Oilpots to thin the crowd.




POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:

* Javelins.  They are now almost useless, unless there could be some form of ""javelin-through-body"" debuff mechanic worked in.  This is sort of bad, as Javelins provide interesting combat situations, but a dedicated mod team could pull around this.

* Bows.  Of any kind, they now provide a very difficult challenge to use.  They still have the range advantage, but now they need to be aimed *exactly*, otherwise they become useless.

But now we enter the troubled times, this game has become popular.. More people are playing and that's great, there's more competition, more servers to pick.. More assholes to encounter..

I play a lot of FFA, and I try to play a lot of Classic Duel servers (Before Duel was a Mode, Classic Duel was 1v1 FFA).. Lately nearly all the FFA Classic Duel servers (Again, FFA 1v1) I've joined are filled with players going at it, standard FFA styled.. When I bring it up, 4 times now - I get vote kicked and told it's an FFA Server (and called some variation of fagget, homo, dick, etc)..

Chivalry used to be filled with gallant warriors ready to battle wits with steel and iron.. I would thirst for blood, as too would my opponents.. We would bow to each other and respect our victors.. Now my mums getting fucked by 13 year olds..

We had a fourth archer bug us, so we'd take up arms, go murder him, then go back to brawling. All without any speaking in the chat.  
The archer eventually quit, and we spent the rest 4 minutes punching each other in turns, while the third one waits to fight the winner. I was laughing throughout all of it. Only chat messages were farewells when the round was ending. Good times.

They hinted at being able to change the color of your clothing by making is auto choose for you when you enter FFA. I forget what video I watched where he touched on that point.

One thing I would love to see would be sliders for each section of your armor that is static. So if you are on Agatha you will have a section of your armor that is always blue and cannot be changed. 
BUT things like your boots or gloves or maybe just the lower section of your clothing should be able to be changed in color. 

Of course the helmets are the big thing. I have seen the screenshot of the veteran helmets and cant help but think they need about 15 different helms to choose from for each class.  The extra helmets and being able to change small parts of your armors color would allow everyone to look almost unique and really add to the game. 

Also I want to look the same as my gang when we rumble in FFA.

On to the steam part. I think it would be amazing if the community would be able to make skins and mods and such for Chivalry. I would even be open to a style like TF2 where you can buy different helmets and gear to change the look of your guy. I understand lots of people hate that but I dont miss the 6 bucks i spent on a beard and hat for my solider in TF2. Ive never seen anyone who looks the same in game with the same colors. TF2 has made it so you can modify the crap out of your character and its still very easy to tell what team everyone is on.

It was kind of successful. You found 2 of the 4 cows I required, and later I found out that I was missing another one.

Some of them are visible only on Spectate, and others can be seen while playing normally, so it's hard to put limits to where they can be. There might even be a tiny cow instead (Fucking DiningHall). I want to post an album here with the location of these easter eggs, but I'm waiting until I have all of them.

So this is what we're still missing(texts copied from the last post, becasue nothing has changed):

* **Cistern**: Fuck this map. I've been searching on it for hours, and nothing. And it's a small map too. There is a way to leave the inside, in case anybody wants: Go to the middle of the map and look to the side where there's light coming in. Now look to the tunnel on your right. On theright side of the arc that starts the tunnel, there is a place that you can go throught. I know my explanation sucks, but if you fly in there for a while you'll find it.

* **Throne Room (normal/XL)**: Doesn't matter which one, because it seems like they are both the same. You can also leave the small version by gong throught the big sphere on the center.

* **Stonehill**: I could swear there was a cow on Stonehill behind the walls, near where the ram comes from. Maybe like I'm just crazy.

I think the cows on StoneHill and ThroneRoom are in the same spot, since one is just a portion of the other.

Sorry, this was put out a little later than normal due to waiting for a couple of things!

~ First off, we’re excited to give you a sneak peak on our new customization in game. Like we said previously, you can change the background pattern and colors of your outfit for both team play and FFA, as well as customize emblems. You can see nice close up views of your character and spin them around to see how it looks from all angles. You can choose which helm you’d like your character to wear from this screen as well.

~ Secondly, phase 4 of the beta build should have been online sometime tonight, however, Steam decided to be difficult at that exact moment, so most likely we’ll have to wait until Monday. Sorry! :( So to tide you over until it’s officially updated, here are a few fixes and alterations written up by SlyGoat, of what’s to come. Balance changes shall wait til’ Monday!

**CU1 Patch 2 Beta 4** (Just a preview of what's to come!)

**Fixes:**

* Projectile stickies should work again.
* Assists now properly awarded to both teams.
* Alt slash tracers for fists draw properly.
* Projectile speed should no longer be influenced by framerate.

**Alterations:**

* Special daze length from 1.5 seconds to 2.
* Ranged weapons no longer flinch on hit (attack is canceled instead), and can now cancel attack at any time.
* One-handed bastard swords withut a shield now 'officially' supported; 1 will toggle between one-handed and two-handed, 3 will toggle shield if equipped.
* Vanguard sprint attack can now be rebound to a key other than mouse 1 to allow you to perform normal slash attacks with a sprint attack readied.

**New experimental feint changes:**

* Attack grunt will play in the last 200 ms of windup - beyond this point attacks may not be feinted.
* Combos can no longer be feinted.

**Stamina drain changes:**

* Stamina drain from parrying an attack is now locked between 8 and 25, from 7-35.
* Stamina drain more consistently based on relative weapon weight rather than damage.
* Less cases of minimum or maximum stamina drain outside of extreme circumstances like maul vs. dagger.

**Chase boost changes:**

* Chase boost now only activates against an enemies with their backs turned.
* Chase boost activates from further away.

**Low stamina sounds updated:**

* A wheezing sound will loop when you're under 30% stamina.
* Out of stamina grunt plays when you try to perform an action you don't have enough stamina for, rather than when you swing with 0 stamina.

*More to come next week!*

I found it annoying to have to download 1.xxGB every time I wanted to go from retail to beta update, so this made it easier.

Just copy **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\chivalrymedievalwarfare** while on the retail patch.

If you want to play on the beta patch, rename **chivalrymedievalwarfare BETA** to just **chivalrymedievalwarfare**.

If you want to play on the retail version, rename **chivalrymedievalwarfare RETAIL** to just **chivalrymedievalwarfare**.
Just remember to keep the folders named so you know which version is which.

I play a **Knight** who favors a **kite shield &amp; one-handed warhammer**. While my kill range is low, I can just about 2-shot every class with reasonable swing speed. 

HOW YOU CAN KILL ME:

**Archer** Take your potshots sure, but if I have my shield up and am charging you: Run. Your only chance is to out-distance me OR circle strafe and stab-spam with a fast weapon (we can't block them all, and will take 1-3 hits before we can land one if you are quick on the block.

**Man At Arms** Firepots take out 1/3rd of our health- that will usually put us at 2-axe range. Overhead attacks to get around the shield with an axe are good, circle strafe with delayed horizontal attacks are good. The Dodge-attack after a successful block is easily deflected- don't waste your time unless your opponent is bad. From my experience, the weapons that hit harder are better than the super-fast but weak ones against us. You only need to make 1 mistake for us to brain you- make your time count. 

**Vanguards** Your Horizontal attacks against our shields are bad, and you should feel bad. Range is your friend- stabbing with long-range weapons are my greatest bane. Keep us at range, block our initial swings, and stab-riposte. 

**Knights** OVER THE TOP. Our shields will block most of what you've got going, so you either need to Down-Mousewheel or stab at an opportune time. Remember- a full health knights V.S. full health knight- I WILL get 2 hammer hits (a kill) in before you get two hits with your big axe/maul/sword- so don't try and trade blows. 

I hope this is helpful- feel free to add in your own strategies that you have trouble with!

**CU1 Patch 3 Beta 3**: Our next beta patch has been released into the beta app! This one fixes the issues with customization, micro transactions and the broken issues on the EU beta servers. Patch notes can be found here: http://www.chivalrythegame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=16094

**Hacks/Cheats**: New hack preventions have resulted in 40 bans in the past week. We are continuing to monitor the situation to ensure we are on top of everything in terms of hacking and cheating.

If you encounter someone cheating and are 100% sure they are cheating, contact a server admin from the Steam group here:  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/chivmod
If you aren’t able to get ahold of someone, then please make sure you have proof (videos, pictures, etc) along with their FULL Steam ID (not just their nickname) and then send all that info to kimiko@tornbanner.com

**RCon/Server Admins**: We’ve been testing out RCon on the beta app and it’s been working out pretty well so far. With this in mind, server owners will be able to have different levels of admin support for their servers. I will be looking for dedicated people to help admin our official servers. More details to come later.

**Google+**: As I finally learned how to make an actual group and not just the community group, I have made an official g+ group for Chivalry.

Hello everyone!

It’s that time again for our Friday update!

~ This week has been the focus on continuing to work on the balance changes for CU1 patch 2. While we hoped to have a new update on the beta for you by today, it just wasn’t possible, but stay tuned, it will be coming soon.

~ An exciting piece of news is  that this weekend is free to play Chivalry on Steam! From now until Sunday at 4pm EST, you can enjoy the game for free! The game is also discounted a whopping 66% from now until Monday at 1pm EST, so get it while it’s hot!

In order to play the game for free, you need to look in your uninstalled games in your games library, it will be grayed out and you will install it from here. Keep in mind that once the free weekend is up, you will no longer be able to play, so take advantage of the sale!

I know there has been some issues with people not being able to join the servers. This is something that is occurring on Steam’s end, but we’re trying to figure out what we can do to help lessen the load all around. What has worked for a lot of people has been to restart steam - completely end the task and restart it, then try again. I do apologize that everyone is being affected.

~ Level Designer Andrew Seyko made some 2D overhead TO maps for us, which can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.569114103128268.1073741828.117802204926129&amp;type=3

~ I setup a Google+ community page for Chivalry, so be sure to add us!
https://plus.google.com/communities/109333686453335811238

~ We have a Community Events section up on our forums, where you can host your own event or contest, so either check out what we have going on already or start your own!
http://www.chivalrythegame.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=91

~ Thanks everyone for your continued support. Til’ next week!

The offending player was thusly ridiculed into rage-quitting. No need for  such in a game.

Here's how it works. 

**Ultimate goal is overthrowing the King Argon or King Malric at Stoneshill or Citadel**

* We start with a Team Deathmatch at Moor. 
If Agatha wins, we move to Battlegrounds, where Mason will defend their Castle against the Agathian Army. If Mason wins the deathmatch,  we move to a Team Deathmatch at Argons Wall, where Agatha will attempt to repel the invading Mason forces.

* At either of the second stages, if the attacker fails in their advance, they RETREAT and take two steps back, so if Mason is to lose at Moor, but win at Battlegrounds, they will meet Agatha at Argon's Wall, and vice versa. However if the attacker wins, its on to the next Team Objective where Agatha will attempt to eliminate the Mason fleet at Hillside, or Mason will attempt to ruthlessly poison Agatha's drinking water at the Dark Forest, and eliminate any heir that King Argon might have to the throne.

* At the third stage, if the attacker loses, the fight returns to the objective stage that the defenders have not yet beaten. For instance, if Mason has lost both Moor and Battlegrounds, but then wins at Hillside, they will advance to Argon's Wall. If they have already beaten Argon's Wall, they move to Dark Forest and attempt victory there.

* The final stage will be StonesHill for the Agathian defenders, and Citadel for the Mason defenders, where the Kings will defend their keeps from the advancing army. Agatha will liberate the Mason's slaves in a self-righteous act of mercy, and Mason will attempt to murder, rape, and plunder the small village outside of King Argon's Keep.

* Upon the defeat of either king, the losing team will have a chance for a rebuttal, sending a elite task force directly to the opposing castle if they have left any stage untouched. (For instance, if Mason steamrolls agatha and beats them at Argon's Wall, Dark Forest, and Stoneshill before Agatha has had a chance to attack at Battlegrounds or Hillside, they will attack Citadel directly and attempt to assassinate the King.

* If the rebuttal is successful, then there will be one sudden death round of LTS at moor, with the winner of this fight being the Ruler of the Realm!

* Intermissions will be periodical drunken brawls at the Tavern!

**COME AND SUPPORT YOUR KING!**

1374299782.0,20,self.ChivalryGame,1iok97,Had in interesting encounter with a Kila member today...,Waldinian,23,3,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1iok97/had_in_interesting_encounter_with_a_kila_member/,"http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/577869232768461919/F54C827813BCAD358ECB08DBFF2970467D2718CA/

It was late at night, and I wanted to get some head chopping in before going to bed, so I joined an arena LTS server. It was a multiplay pub server. On it were a few Kila members. They were all talking in the in-game voice chat.

I decided to go vanguard with greatsword. I wind up going 5-0 or 6-0 or something, untiil |ĶiĻă| Baine decides to start attacking teammates. He is slashing and stabbing at teammates left and right, regardless of whether they are his clanmates or not. Then he starts throwing kniives at me as I am leaving the spawn. Naturally, I kill him with my greatsword of justice. 

Again, the next round, he starts attacking me and other teammates in the spawn again. Again, I murder him with my mighty greatsword of vengance. He decides to place a kick vote on me, calling me a tking tard. I get kicked with around 66% because his Kila buddies voted yes and some random folks on the other team just saw ""24% team damage"" (from attacking baine) and voted yes.

Normally, I would not be angry. People can be dicks, and you just got to brush it off sometimes. However, coming from Kila, I would expect better. Usually, I like Kila members. They are respectful, good players, and I have a number of them friended on steam, too. 

Has anyone else had this kind of experience with Kila?

1370397853.0,21,self.ChivalryGame,1fp06t,How the comp. scene works,HELPMEIMGONADIE,21,0,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1fp06t/how_the_comp_scene_works/,"First off, this post was made before, but people are having trouble finding it so I rehosted it [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1fnpt1/how_the_competitive_scene_works/)

So, seeing a LOT of comments on questions about the comp. scene in chivalry I decided to give a basic outline here, as in 2:30 a.m. I just don't have a lot to do.

Anyways, at the moment, no leagues exist. Tourneys are announced via forums and contacting the clan leaders directly. The NA scene at least has ~250 members who play on different teams. (Average 20 people per team). Tournaments are usually hosted by one person or a small group who own dedicated servers. They find streamers and refs for the tourneys, and organize it. These mostly go smooth.

The next part varies by clan, and I only have experience from my own and from a fer other clans. Matches against other clans are usually done in two ways. 1- Clans set up weekly scrims against each other. ie. At 9 PM EST on Saturday my clan is to scrim another. These are set up via clans contacting one another and the schedules are posted in the clans Steam group for the members to see. 2- Clan people just contact someone from another clan, asking to scrim. Clan that was contacted is usually with his clan so he asks, and sends back an answer. These happen pretty often in my expecerience. Clans also hold practices on a regular basis, which may be daily or weekly. At least here in ia, it's daily at 8:30. These involve inclan scrims or organized practice for different classes. This can vary a lot between clans. So lets say you find a clan to scrim against, got your own team and they got theirs. One team hosts a passworded server, sends the console command via Steam who than gives it to his teamates. The begin to join, do some FFA untill both teams are prepared. Team size is traditionally 5v5 and 8v8 but these often change in friendly scrims, depending on how many players are on. Anything from 4v4 to 10v10. These scrims also are played in either LTS or TO. Once both teams are ready and the gametype is decided, each team sends one dueler to a team for one round of dueling to determine who picks map, and who picks side. Victor picks map, loser picks side. After map has been deicded the map will be changed by the admin and it will begin. Clans follow specific rules such as no third person, 100% friendly fire and only allowing 50% of your team to be any one class, etc.

If LTS the match will start, if everyone spawns each team usually says live, and it begis. First one to 7 match wins, wins the game. Pretty simple.

If Team Objective that match will begin. This takes place in 2 rounds, as the roles are reversed. If the first attacking team finishes the match completing all objectives, than the next attacking team needs to beat their time to win. If both teams only beat some of them, than it goes by how much time was remaining (say as king) or as to what progress the team has made (say pushing the cart) Game ends, gg is shared and the teams usually go their seperate ways or just FFA again for a bit

Scrims usually arent hard to get , its jsut a matter of contacting other clans. Some Steam Groups are set up where people you can contact to scrim are in, to easily find people. Most members form dif. clans know and already have eachother added anyways. Clans usually stick in a voice server and possibly their own chiv server most the time. Basically everything is done in private, via steam. And I think thats about it.
If you have any questions, leave them. If any other clan guys read this and have anything to add, please share. :D

EDIT: This is the NA scene, with about ~400 members

I would definitely say I'm above average, I can hold my own in all game types and feel like I am a strong opponent to contend with...

However, the other day I went on to a FFA Duel server to test out the Beta patch and... god almighty there were some great players. I can't recall the names, but one was in a clan called KMC?

Anyway, he was truly skilled and so were the other players. I got my ass handed to me and I was just curious...

How on earth did you learn those techniques you use? How can I better my game?

Primarily I play Vanguard with Greatsword or Zwei and on LTS I play  Knight with Longsword. I don't feign, just use weapon dragging / delaying and combos or jumping to imitate a jump overhead and then after the block I attack. Little things like that, which I thought were pretty skillful, but nothing I did was anywhere near up to par as these gents.

Any ideas/ tips? Where do you skilled players normally practice? It'd be great to come and watch you guys duel and maybe pick up a few things on the way.

After that it should let you back into any servers. I have no idea why this works but it worked for me and a couple other people. Hope this helps!

Knights with shields make a protective barrier out of which the vanguard strike at people who get too close, skirmishers deal with flanking attacks. Best for maps based on taking objectives.

Some questions that came to mind:

Should Chivalry have thought about their proposed stretch goals, and should the stretch goals be considered part of the full game?
  
Should the money earned from being massively successful contribute to the remaining stretch goals (Two ""???"" and a Mac version, Emblem customisation if not counting micro-transactions), and do you think the developers have used the funded money correctly given the time between updates, hot fixes, and lack of bug support (steam achievements, map bugs, rank skips (which now affect players more than ever given the hat unlocks), server list bugs, tutorial bugs, [and more](http://tornbanner.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=87&amp;sid=fd04a69d3196c38dc2ecb5c2b9648b82))?",Discussion,False,,t5_2vb9k,1376481786.0,,,True,t3_1kccuf,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1kccuf/chivalry_and_its_kickstarter_stretch_goals/,

On behalf of all my clan, i want to apologise to the people who might have been harassed or trolled by someone wearing our tag this week.

Indeed it has been three days since an infamous french player started using our tag ([ҒҒ]) and even our names in public servers to soil our reputation (those knowing us can, i think, attest that all our members are mature enough and never act toxic).

To sum up what have been going lately, this player (his former name is Funk) applied (with an other name, making his real name disappear by changing it a lot of time) to our clan a week ago. However, his lack of dedication during our trainings, as well as his behaviour made us direct him towards better suited clans. As you did guess by now, he took it pretty bad and tries to harm us in any way possible. 

Thus if you see any [ҒҒ] having a toxic behaviour in game, please keep in mind that there is a *really good chance* he is not from our clan. (He told us some of his friends took our tag too but we can't confirm this since we haven't seen them)

I want particularly to apologise towards the Death Toll and Broken Banner clans who have been trolled by him during the semifinal of our tournament.

Thank you for reading this and taking it into account.( I hope it was cristal clear ^^)
See you on the battlefield. =)

• You can find them buried in - C:\Users\Username\Documents\My Games\Chivalry Medieval Warfare\UDKGame\Config\UDKStats.ini.

• UDKStats contains rows of numbers. The top number is your total score. Kills earn you 200pts, assists 100(not sure about assists).

• Each rank takes *approximately* 1.125 times higher score than the last.  
To know when you will achieve next rank, next time you rank up, don't fight any more that match.  
When server goes to next map, leave the server, copy your UDKStats and save the copy elsewhere.  
Multiply this saved score by 1.125 and you will get an approximate score needed for next level.  
Compare the difference to your current score as you progress to know how far you have left to go.

• Example:  
rank 56 = 22,301,900.  
22,301,900 x 1.125 = 25,089,637 = rank 57  
Divide the difference by 200 to get an approximate kills remaining to rank up:  
25,089,637 - 22,301,900 = 2,787,737. This is the score gap 56-57.  So about 14,000 kills.  

• Below your total score are weapon group kill totals. You can add all of these up to get your total actual kills.

• Here's a copy of my UDKStats to show you what each row is:

I quite new to this game (just reached rank 10) but I've watched some videos on youtube so I sort of know how to fight. 

The match I just finished had an amazing ending. I became the king for the first time and all my allies stood around me with shields to protect me from arrows which was really cool. 

When all my fellow knights were killed I ended up in a 1v4 situation which I somehow managed to survive. I blocked the first attackers swipe and then ducked under the next ones, blocked another strike and then went for the fast horizontal strike using mouse drag as I learned on youtube. I killed two guys in one hit and blocked another hit.

 By now I had no health left whatsoever. And just when I thought it was over came all my allies running up the stairs screaming from the top of their lungs. They fended off the remaining enemies just as the next wave came. Unfortunately one of the vanguards attacking managed to get a spear though the defenses and landed the killing blow on me. 

I wasn't upset though, I had so much fun and it was a great match.

That's pretty much all I wanted to share, feel free to add HOLY STAN on steam if you want to play some time (I'm playing a lot of other games currently though so I might not be online that much.) 

And one quick question, which weapon is considered the best for knights? I'm using the sword of war right now because I feel like the speed of it lets me be more in control of my character.

- Pick your fights, dont rush at a group of 4 people hoping for a good outcome. Go for individual fighters or people who are off guard.
- When using your secondary, although it is annoying and cheap, just mash the LMB. It swings so fast that it is hard to block.
- One of the most effective swing combos, IMO, is to do an overhead attack followed with a stab. Its quick and deals good damage.
- When fighting against longer length weapons, get used to their length. It is great to know when you are just out of reach, you wont need to block so you can go in for a quick hit.
- When playing MaA, use one-button-dodge. As a person who uses MaA almost exclusively, I mapped OBD to ""spacebar"" and jump to ""E"". Since I dont jump much, this was a perfect alternative, you can keep your move fingers on the keys and use your thumb to dodge.
- The higher kill unlock weapons aren't always better. Check the stats of the weapons. Personally I look for speed and damage because when playing MaA or Archer you are going to have to get close anyway.
- When using MaA, use oil pots. They can injure groups of people and will take enough HP from a Knight/Vanguard to kill them a lot faster.

**Fighting against shields.** *Shields can be rather annoying when fighting a heavier armored opponent. My best tip is to learn to attack around the shield.*

- There is a key you can map, I think it is called ""Alternative slash"", instead of swinging from the right, you swing from the left. When using this move quickly to the left and do the alternative slash. Most of the time you can land the hit.
- Another thing most people dont expect, is a jump attack. When moving in to a target, wind up an overhead swing and jump over the shield. Usually people dont think their attacker is going to jump and cant block in time.
- Another thing to do is use ""kick"" or ""bash"" to knock the enemy back to where he cant block. I usually dont have luck with this but it can be effective.
- When playing as MaA, dodge to the left or right of the attacker and take a swing, the dodge is so quick it will take a precise mouse move and good timing to block your attack.

**That's all I have for now. Hopefully this helped some of you.**

Might just get ya killed.,absurdparadox,31,12,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1cyiol/psa_careful_with_those_kicks_might_just_get_ya/,"Hey guys, I'm no pro or anything (I'm like 1000-400 I believe), but I have won an astounding number of duels by forcing people to kick my shield when they are too low on health. I'm sure a lot of experience players are aware of this, but if you are not, and if you are like me, it will vastly change some of your tactics.

Here is the way it works.

1. I get you to within 1 swing on life total
2. I ensure that I won't die from one hit from you.
3. I just turtle until you kick
4. You get a free hit, but this hit does not flinch me or kill me.
5. I get a free hit immediately after, as I am not flinched, you die (I do believe this can be dodged)

This is ridiculously effective with the warhammer or norse sword against MAA, since you only need two hits.

* **New Look**:  If you haven’t noticed it yet, our site http://tornbanner.com got a fresh new look along with merging our forums over.  We would love to have your opinion on the new forums as they are still a work in progress, please feel free to post constructive criticism  and suggestions for the forums here: http://www.tornbanner.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=16744

* **SDK**: With the release of our Content Update 2 (Customization) Patch, our next major focus will be getting the SDK tools and Steam Workshop integrated into our game. We will continue to release updates on the beta app where you can currently use and test out the SDK. You can check out some user created maps and game modes on our forums here:  http://tornbanner.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=51

* **RCon**:  We've written a Chivalry parser for BigBrotherBot which has been integrated into the program. While it hasn’t made it into a stable release yet, you can download the B3 daily builds which, as of v1.10.dev.daily68, include the parser. http://files.cucurb.net/b3/daily/

To use BigBrotherBot, you should still follow the directions on their site here: http://wiki.bigbrotherbot.net/installation:start for installing and configuring it, but use a daily build (at least v1.10.dev.daily68) from http://files.cucurb.net/b3/daily. When setting up the bot, set the ""game"" to chiv

To set the rcon port the game uses, add this to PCServer-UDKGame.ini:

[AOC.AOCRCon]
RConPort=27960

* **Community Events**: Our Community Fun Night last Saturday was a great success! Thank you to everyone who came and participated in our little extravaganza. Due to the great turnout, we will be having Community Fun Nights each month with days and times varying. A special thanks to http://LowPingServers.Com who sponsored our event by hosting both the game server and Mumble we used to voice chat. They also provided a prize of a free server for 30 days for our raffle. The winner of the raffle was RushSecond. Congratulations! Stay tuned for not only our Community Fun Nights where we just casually play for fun, but also other events as which are posted in our Community Events forum located here:  http://tornbanner.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=91

* **Patch**:  If you noticed a small 50MB patch, this was for localization only. The following changes were:

-Added new scripts into the two main fonts, including: simplified Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, Arabic, Lao, Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics

-Removed the separate Japanese fonts (as Japanese glyphs are now part of the two main fonts)

* **Translations**: A new sub-section is up on our forums called Game Translations found here: http://tornbanner.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=101. If you are interested in translating the game to your language, please use this section. Please follow the guidelines here: http://tornbanner.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=101&amp;t=16905  before proceeding.

Thank you and see you next week!

Will go on until we don't have enough players [Some role-playing involved],HELPMEIMGONADIE,21,4,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1jpz11/the_campaign_of_chivalrymw_who_will_you_side_with/,"Hello /r/chivalrygame, 



I'm proud to announce and host the campaign of our beloved game, Chivalry: Medevial warfare. It will be mostly based on this idea -[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1jmjl9/i_need_1015_players_for_a_test_run_tonight_prize/) (He said I could carry it on)

Here's how it works.

**Ultimate goal is overthrowing the King Argon or King Malric at Stoneshill or Citadel**

* We start with a Team Deathmatch at Moor. If Agatha wins, we move to Battlegrounds, where Mason will defend their Castle against the Agathian Army. If Mason wins the deathmatch, we move to a Team Deathmatch at Argons Wall, where Agatha will attempt to repel the invading Mason forces.

* At either of the second stages, if the attacker fails in their advance, they RETREAT and take two steps back, so if Mason is to lose at Moor, but win at Battlegrounds, they will meet Agatha at Argon's Wall, and vice versa. However if the attacker wins, its on to the next Team Objective where Agatha will attempt to eliminate the Mason fleet at Hillside, or Mason will attempt to ruthlessly poison Agatha's drinking water at the Dark Forest, and eliminate any heir that King Argon might have to the throne.

* At the third stage, if the attacker loses, the fight returns to the objective stage that the defenders have not yet beaten. For instance, if Mason has lost both Moor and Battlegrounds, but then wins at Hillside, they will advance to Argon's Wall. If they have already beaten Argon's Wall, they move to Dark Forest and attempt victory there.

* The final stage will be StonesHill for the Agathian defenders, and Citadel for the Mason defenders, where the Kings will defend their keeps from the advancing army. Agatha will liberate the Mason's slaves in a self-righteous act of mercy, and Mason will attempt to murder, rape, and plunder the small village outside of King Argon's Keep.

* Upon the defeat of either king, the losing team will have a chance for a rebuttal, sending a elite task force directly to the opposing castle if they have left any stage untouched. (For instance, if Mason steamrolls agatha and beats them at Argon's Wall, Dark Forest, and Stoneshill before Agatha has had a chance to attack at Battlegrounds or Hillside, they will attack Citadel directly and attempt to assassinate the King.

* If the rebuttal is successful, then there will be one sudden death round of LTS at Arena, with the winner of this fight being the Ruler of the Realm!

* Between matches, which won't be long will be filled with FFA's on different maps.

We will be hosting it on the ia teamspeak along with the ia server, and ip's for both will be given out before it begins. We want people to show up a little bit early so we can get rolling quickly. We really want everyone to be on teamspeak, mic or no mic. I'll have to give priority if we run out of slots to people in teamspeak. Role playing doesn't need to be very intensive, but feel free to do so if you want.

We hope to see at least 16 people! Max of 24.

Also, we have some steam games to giveaway to the victor mvp!

Edit: North american only, will be on a central server

* **CU1 Patch 3 Beta 4: **

The next phase of our beta patch has been released. Full patch notes can be found here: 
http://www.chivalrythegame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=16298

** Remember in order to test out any changes before they are released to the live game, you need to have the beta app installed. Once you do, just click play and click the top option “Play Chivalry: Medieval Warfare Beta”. If you wish to check out the SDK and begin modding, you can click on the third option “Editor (64-bit)”. You can find help on the SDK, brainstorm some ideas and post your mods and maps in the custom content of our forums. http://www.chivalrythegame.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=94 section 

* **Picture time: **

When I was in Toronto hanging out with my team at Torn Banner, my buddy Hugh from Unknown Worlds also came by, and he was kind enough to take some pictures of us!
Check them out here! https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.601112279928450.1073741833.117802204926129&amp;type=3

* **Official Servers: **

All official servers have been fixed up nicely. Renamed and ordered properly, so each server is now numbered only once to eliminate confusion about what server you are on. I also added more servers to each specific game server mode, specifically more US servers as those were needed, so it’s pretty even around the block between North America and Europe, with a few Australian and Asian servers mixed in. 

We’ve gotten a lot of questions asking whether or not we have South American servers and unfortunately, we do not as Multiplay does not offer services there. It appears to be quite difficult to find a host who does carry game servers in South America due to them not having the proper exchange points and networks. So we apologize for this, but there isn’t a whole lot we can do for now. Hopefully we will be able to offer South America some better servers in the future!

* **Community Events: **

We’ve got two Official Community Events happening this month! 

The first happens this weekend and is titled “Line Formations” and is being run by our Events Coordinator and Forum Moderator Chuckingit!. Full info on the event can be found here: http://www.chivalrythegame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&amp;t=15733 
Sign-ups end today, August 2, so be sure to post in the thread if you are interested. There will be prizes awarded to the top 3 players, so check it out!

The second is a Community Fun Night which happens on Saturday August 10th at 4pm EST. Everyone is welcome to attend! It’s just a chance for some of the community to get together and have a good time playing with one another. We will have a couple servers set aside for this, as well as a Mumble server setup. So if you can attend, please be sure to post in the thread here: http://www.chivalrythegame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&amp;t=16242, so we can get an approximate head count of who will be attending and how many servers will need. This is the first of many Community Fun Nights we’ll be having, so let’s make this first one a success! Get to know your fellow community members and make some new friends.

And also a reminder, that we encourage others to make their own community events and post them in our Community Events sub-forum: http://www.chivalrythegame.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=91. Just be sure to read the guidelines posted here: http://www.chivalrythegame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&amp;t=13484 to find out what you can and can’t do! This section is strictly for fun and we’d like to get more community involvement here. So if that’s your thing, please set something up!

In TO it turns into play as vanguard, and simply out foot work the enemy into swinging early or hitting their own team mates.  I'm not offering solutions, or critism.  I'm just curious if other people feel the same way?

Personally, I can't even play TO anymore, because it just feels so mindless after dueling.  Even FFA I find provides more fun than TO.

* Class change menu needs a return button, at the moment you can be chatting, have the chat wiped by a state change and then bring up the class menu, and you're gonna be typing when changing states above all else (good fight etc)

We’ve just been bombarding you with all kinds of fun things lately and this week is no different!

1)**Mod Tools + SDK**: Yes, we released this in alpha stage on our beta app 3 days ago and the response has been enormous. People have really been looking forward to this and now that it’s out to be played with, expect to see all kinds of new and fun content that will keep you entertained for hours! Keep in mind that this is still in the early stages, so it won’t be released to the live game for some time, but enjoy playing with it and creating your content in the meantime.
There are lot of good tutorials out there, so be sure to search around! Also, it’s very important that you read through our SDK documentation carefully, so you understand how everything works prior to starting and while you are getting setup. Our documentation can be found here:  https://tornbannerjira.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CHIVCOM/Chivalry+SDK

2) **Emblem Contest**: In case you missed it the first time, we have an emblem contest going on right now! The lucky winners will get their emblem put into our game in our customization setup and receive a peasant hat for their characters!
Full details here:  http://www.chivalrythegame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=14449

3) We’ve brought back our IRC channel so come chat with us!
Channel: #tornbanner on QuakeNet
http://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=tornbanner

4) **CU1 Patch 2 Beta 6 RC 1** is now updated on the beta app!

Yes, yet another beta update, but we’re down to the wire and after this one, we should be releasing into the live very soon!

Here are the changes that were done:

* - If you're kicked during shield drop you're no longer special dazed, only if the kick connects against an active block.
* - If you're hit in release on the server, but you're in transition on the client, it forces you into recovery. I.E. client and server are now properly syncing release-flinch.
* - Shields should have a .3 longer drop time if you raise your shield while in recovery. This is in the same vein as recovery parries not allowing counterattacks.
* - Tapping block with a shield while deflected extends your shield drop by the remaining time in your deflect, so you can't abuse shield tap to attack quickly after being parried or hitting a wall.
* - Projectile stickys should now show up on characters when they’re hit, both when they’re alive or dead. 
* - Flinch is now 1.1 for two handed weapons.
* - Kicks now have a 1 second cool down.
* - You can no longer attack during pre-round freeze in duel mode (IE. Archers).
* - Pole Hammer sprint attack fixed (no longer able to move freely in any direction during the attack).
* - Dodging during recovery should only apply to attack recovery, not parry recovery (same as live).
* - The panic parry function should only work in an attack recovery, not a parry recovery.

I am ejoying this game immesly! Such a wonderful change of pace to the COD's and their clones. Plus I swear I can feel my mouse shake when my maul takes someones head off. I just have a few questions though about some combat tactics and the way things work so here goes.


1. 1st or 3rd? Is this just a preference thing or is one better then the other?


2. I am getting better at playing classes. Moving from knight to vanguard and MAA. However even when I play a MAA or Vangaurd I can never catch someone in their swing. Ill give you an example. A vanguard swings at me with the claymore. I block it and slash back with my 1h mace. He also starts to perform a second swing. Somehow my faster weapon will not hit him before his claymore lops my head off. Am I missing something? What is the trick to timing?


3.  I always seem to run out of stamina before ANYONE. I see people wildly slashing and they just keep going. I just sit there, try to time my attacks and somehow I am depleted. Any tips for this?


4. Lastly some tactics. How do I defend and win against a Vanguard? They seem to swing fast and I can never get in close. Same goes for MAA. They are just too fast for me and I can never catch them in a swing. Their swings never seem to reset while mine always do.

You've probably seen myself and him here for awhile now, and most likely ingame. 

What this means for the subreddit: We can moderate some posts! Mostly troll posts and blatant reposts will be taken away. Also, streams that are posted will be checked by the mods, and if they see that the stream has ended will delete the post. This will help stop a big problem that has been arising with these posts sticking around hours after they're gone

Most likely every Friday from now on a post will be made for people to discuss buying/selling/trading cards. these will also be moderated for any possible scammers.

We're still going to keep this subreddit open. Because of torn banners harsh moderation of the forums, here has always been a place for free discussion and expressing the unpopular opinion. 

I'm hoping to keep it free, but update the sidebar and work to form the old community back together. It's also to reduce spam and unimportant dead stream links.

I've always enjoyed dueling other players. That is, when I run into an enemy on a battlefield and we fight alone to the finish. These duels tend to be quick adrenaline rushed affairs leaving you with a great feeling of accomplishment. The nature of the game mode forces this, you are both constantly looking over your shoulder for fear of a third party interfering, and likely you also have an objective to get to so time is of the essense. This leads to fast furious attacks and parries and the fight is usually resolved quickly.  
  
Duel mode on the other hand, neither opponent has anything else to worry about. This seems to be why 75% of players in duel mode only use spears. The only tactic seemse to be to keep your opponent at range and wait for him to try to attack. There is no excitement to be found like with informal duels, as there is no incentive to resolve the fight quickly.

The servers that have ""duel"" in the name are still there, sitting in the server list, sucking in players who can't read or don't know what it means and lying to the ones who do. When the game first launched, this wasn't nearly such a problem. People who didn't know what it was at first picked up quickly and didn't go around indiscriminately attacking people for very long.

Today, I went through 5 duel servers, each one filled with people who either didn't understand or didn't care. The last one I entered had the largest number of actual duelers (maybe 4 of a server of 12 players), and they were attempting to either explain to newer players or kick the ones who refused to listen. I felt it was necessary to lend a hand when a vote was started against a player who continued to attack people ceaselessly despite everything the duelers had said. The reason why he was being kicked was clearly stated several times in the chat. I typed ""VOTE YES"" in the chat, to which a player named ""Zelden"" responded with ""VOTE NO"". The vote failed, and immediately ""Zelden"" proceeded to initiate a vote against me, which went through, and I was kicked.

Yes, I am obviously quite upset at the juvenile behavior of ""Zelden"", but I don't think this is an isolated incident. Keep in mind this was the fifth failed duel server I entered.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

This is a tutorial on how to edit your control configuration file to execute more complex commands in the game. For this example, we will be mapping ""feint/cancel"" to the same key as ""block/parry"", so that you can parry an opponent even if you've already started to attack with only one button.

The game's configuration files are located in 

`""username""\Documents\My Games\Chivalry Medieval Warfare\UDKGame\Config`

The file we want to edit is called `UDKInput.ini`, open it in notepad or your preferred text editor. Scroll down through the `Binding=` commands until you reach the keyboard section (you could also ctrl+f ""RightMouseButton""). The two commands we want should be right next to each other. My ""feint/cancel"" key is set to ""Q"", which should be right under the ""parry/block"" key which is set to ""RightMouseButton"". It should look something like this:

`Bindings=(Name=""RightMouseButton"",Command=""DoParry | Onrelease LowerShield | GBA_Aim"",Flag=KBFlag_Weapon,FriendlyName=""Parry"")`

`Bindings=(Name=""Q"",Command=""`**GBA_Feint**`"",Flag=KBFlag_Weapon,FriendlyName=""CancelAttack"")`

Copy the bolded command and paste it in front of the command `DoParry`. You now need to separate the commands, which in Unreal Engine's config code is done by [space][pipe][space] or ""` | `"". The end result of your RightMouseButton binding line should look like this:

`Bindings=(Name=""RightMouseButton"",Command=""GBA_Feint | DoParry | Onrelease LowerShield | GBA_Aim"",Flag=KBFlag_Weapon,FriendlyName=""Parry"")`

Save the file and open up Chivalry. You now have the ability to back out of an attack to block much more easily. It's not perfect, you still can't cancel after halfway through the swing, but it does improve the gameplay experience.

This is only a very simple edit but much more complex commands are possible. In Source games like TF2, editing these config files is encouraged and can lead to some pretty awesome command combinations.

Some interesting weapon changes I've noticed:

**Sword of War:**

* Needs a head hit on the overhead + thrust combo to 2hit a vanguard. Can often take 4 hits to kill a knight now, barring head hits.

**Longsword:**

* Same story as Sword of War: Will sometimes take 3 hits to kill van and 4 hits to kill knight.

**Polehammer:**

* 2hits knight with thrust + overhead. Pretty sure head hit required. Always 2hits knight with 2 overheads.

**Maul:**

* Overhead 1hits knights with head hit!

**Claymore:**

* Needs three hits to kill MAA if no thrusts are used, I THINK.
* Takes 4 hits to kill a knight if no head hits(takes two overhead head hits + 1 thrust hit, or two thrust hits + one overhead head hit).
* Can no longer 1hit archer unless charge attack? Takes 3 hits more sometimes to kill vanguard. So basically, it sometimes needs 1 more extra hit than we're used to. I don't think it's OP.

**Messer:**

* Slash can 1-hit MAA if head hit! Yes? Not sure if it still 2hits knights with 2 overheads. I don't think they changed the overhead damage away from swingblunt like they did to the slash.

**Saber:**

* Saber always 2hits archer with 2 overheads.
* Can 2hit MAA with 2 overheads, one a head hit.
* Will often kill van in 3 hits.
* Requires 5 hits on knight with no head hits, but a head hit is likely in the span of 4 attacks, so might often only take 4 hits to kill knight?
* Toss in some backstab damage and saber is a good weapon now. With the windup and combo speed buffs plus the range advantage over shorty and stick, I'd say it's strong vs light classes, and viable vs heavies.

**Heavy Javelin:**

* Thrust backstab does 105 pierce. That's enough to 1hit any class except knight with a head hit(probably need to jump to hit head).

**Bearded Axe:**

* Can 1hit archer now with head hit of its super fast overhead. I think.

**Hunting Knife:**

* Is really fun! The increased size means more reach, combined with it's speed and combo times makes it almost viable in serious play. Just won an FFA with it. XD Can't catch a person running away from you though. Not with slash at least. Haven't tried thrust.

Also, I got owned everytime. No matter how hard I tried, everyone seemed to outmatch me, which is pretty understandable. I was just starting. But little by little, I improved, either reading tips and techniques in this subreddit or watching youtube videos. Right now, my favorite class is Knight (Messer, Mace and Throwing Axes), makes me feel like a fucking beast.

I tried to convince my friends to join me, but they are too obsessed with LoL or WarZ (yes, WarZ). So I had to keep playing alone against everything I heard/read about how playing alone ruins the experience.

Well, I don't know if it has something to do with the game's name, but most of the players, at least in Team Objective and Team Deathmatch are wonderful players. I've never met such a polite and mature community in an online game ever. And that's what made me to keep playing this game even if my friends didn't want to join me.

So, my point is: Do you guys here at Reddit have a clan or something? I remember a guy who posted about a private server, but it never worked for me, not even with console commands or anything. I'd be glad to join you guys and learn something new from pros.",,False,,t5_2vb9k,False,,,True,t3_1axly3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1axly3/1_month_and_a_half/,

I was thinking the other day about how crazy it is for 2h weapons to cut through multiple foes.

Right now it just enabled vans and knights to lmb spam and cut through groups, but I had an idea that might balance their power without nerfing them into the dirt.

Basically I think it would be good for there to be diminishing returns on attack. Lets say a van slashes at three people ( and hits them all.) First target would receive full dmg, but each target after that would recieve a cumulatively lesser amount of dmg.

For instance if the diminishing dmg per target past 1 was 10%, then first would take 100, 2nd 90, 3rd 80, etc. I dunno if anything is already in the game like that, but I think it would be nice.

This hit me cause I primarily play FFA, and atm, in that game mode at least knights and vans rack up tons of kills by just attack spamming into groups. If there was a diminishing attack it might alter the current class balance in a good way. 

What do you guys think?

I've already unlocked the heavy javelin thingy, so I've put a decent amount of time into it. Observations and questions are as follows:

Javelins are fucking awesome. Shield, melee weapon, ranged if necessary. Plus you're an archer, so people get tunnel vision and chase you down. I can't count how many times I've ran away from someone chasing me, only to prime a spear, turn around, and throw it into his big stupid face.

That being said, the reload time is KILLING me, quite literally. Is there a way to circumvent this? I'm almost positive there's a way to do it, I've done it before accidentally, but I have no idea what I actually did.

Also, combos. Currently I'm relying on the good ol' poke&gt;overhead&gt;poke, which outright kills everything except knights at full health. Are there other options I should be aware of?

(It seems like I can't feint with javelin pokes. Am I just timing it wrong, or can they not be feinted?)

Also, for those of you with all the unlocks, do you prefer the heavy or regular? I'm used to the speed of the regular javelin, but the heavy seems to do more damage in general. Without feints, though, it's hard to pull off combos as easily because of the slower attack speed.

Yesterday was the final match up of the Do or Die Tournament between Broken Banner and The Phoenix Legion.

That was an intense match is the least to say. I am always amazed at individual player actions in the heat of the moment (crouch dodges and lean back dodges are my favorite) and I was pleased to see some nice moments in this match. 

[Here is the video !](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBqV7D53htI&amp;feature=youtu.be)

And here are nice moments that I noticed:

[3.57 : Dat crouch dodge](http://youtu.be/xBqV7D53htI?t=3m58s)

[6.20 : Awsome duel between Shard and Triwal !](http://youtu.be/xBqV7D53htI?t=6m20s)

[9.10 : Brandicopter swing all along ! And a natural 20 on the archer save !](http://youtu.be/xBqV7D53htI?t=9m10s)

[12.35 : Turtwiggy efforts in the matrix training programs paying off](http://youtu.be/xBqV7D53htI?t=12m35s) 


I would also like to point out that as you could see feints are an integral part of the strategy but many times you can see the player would *not* fall into it. Besides, it eats up your stamina quite fast. The first duel (for side and map) is a good example as Ky Wild quickly ran out of stamina. During the match you could hear a lot this marvelous sound of gorilla on heat when their stam was low as feinting and comboing would take its toll.

Anyway this was a nice match and congratulations to both team for giving us such a nice performance !

3.) Tutorials before combat.


4.) Learn the timings and weapon ranges.

Know the distance of your weapon of choice's attack and just as importantly know your enemies weapon of choice's distance of attack.
To practice just find a post in the game that you can access from all sides and start swinging away. You will notice where you make contact when where you don't. Learn all the weapons at some point or another even if its just so you know how fast all the attacks swing.

-Know your timing. Your footwork is going to get you in and out of trouble a lot more than just swinging your sword and going straight at someone. Learn how to time your attack to hit just after your opponent swings. So put your distance training into practice and learn how to make that contact hit while avoiding a hit on yourself. 

-Learn your opponent. If there is one guy on the server who is kicking your ass - take note of what he is doing. Maybe his class or weapon is something you should try out. Maybe he is just very effective with doing one attack from one angle but no one has figured him out yet... maybe it will be you.

-Throwing weapons vs melee weapons. I use knight and for a while I was using a shield as well. Now I use knight but i strap on the throwing knives. Once you get accurate with the throwing knife it can be very handy. Especially when the opponent is very low health or you yourself are in very low health. Keeping the distance and landing that one quick throw is a great feeling. If you are a guy who uses bows or crossbows then you are probably pretty accurate with your projectiles so just do whatever you are happy with.

-STARTING OFF NEW. I had the pleasure to first introduce my friend to this game after knowing it quite well. I let him start first with 1 on 1s so that he could grasp the timing and the attacks. Then I took him to a small FFA server so he could see what its like to add it all together but have the randomness of FFA. Then I took him to a big objective game where he already had the idea of fighting 1 on 1, 1 vs many and now he could combine it all to do some objectives. 

-Location of DAMAGE. This is important. If you can aim for the neck on your enemy then please do. This is very obvious but very important.

-Quick swing or improvised swing. I often will use a swing and then physically move my mouse in the direction of the swing to make it slightly faster. So imagine I swing downwards or something lets say. I might crouch at the same time and look down towards the enemies feet to increase the swing time and hit him sooner with a downward chop. Or more commonly I will swing with a regular left click and then move my mouse to the left- making my character do the same and make impact sooner.

-Ducking or crouching. I dont see this as often as I used to but I still do it all the time. If you time it correctly you can duck certain horizontal swings. If you duck and look down you can crouch even lower however you cannot see what is going on. So sometimes if I am in the middle of a battle and multiple people are swinging at me, instead of standing there and taking a chop to the head i will duck and hope that someones swing hits someone else. It works it works well but it doesnt work all the time. If you are fighting someone smart and you do this more than once he will figure you out quickly and its all over. 

All in all I just want people to play this game and enjoy it. I am 27 and used to play Rune: Halls of valhalla and LOVED how the multiplayer was. 
It was an honor system kind of like the FFA server duels. Everyone would stand back though and let 2 people go at it and whoever fell was out and whoever stood then fought the next guy,. winner goes on style.    Much love!

I just joined an 8 man duel server, in which there were about 3 or 4 people actually dueling, with the rest running around like twats killing people as if it was FFA. I asked them to stop, told them it was an FFA server, but none of them listened.

Each time one of them would interrupt one of my duels, both of us would stop and go after the interrupters, then resume our duel. This goes on for a few minutes, and in that time I've racked up about 15 kills, of mostly interrupters that keep coming back (or attacking two at once - quickly dying with a hammer swing to their faces).

Next minute, one of them calls a vote to kick me. No reasoning, nothing in chat, and the vote passes with ~75%. The fuck is wrong with these people? If you join a duel server, and don't actually duel, you should expect to get beaten to a pulp by those trying to play properly. But then for the rest of the people on the server who are trying to duel to actually votekick the person cleaning up the idiots....ARGH.

For everyone that attends the event and hangs out with us actively for at least 30 minutes will be entered into a raffle to win a server from http://lowpingservers.com/ for one month!

Fhloston Paradise is a Seattle, WA server with a few restrictions that I believe will make for more balanced, enjoyable Team Objective, Last Team Standing and Team Deathmatch. Of course, being that it is a fairly new, the server experiences very low traffic. That’s where you come in!

Here are the key differences compared to the official servers:

-  Archers are limited to ~~two (2)~~ three (3) per team. 

- Team damage is at 100%. Watch those swings!

- Maximum of 24 players to cut down on lag and encourage more competitive play.

- The minimum rank to join the server is ~~20~~ 15. I believe this is necessary with the increased team damage.

The server cycles between Team Objective, Last Team Standing and Team Deathmatch. However, I have had issues with the server following the maps in order – I’m hoping to have this resolved soon, if I haven’t already.

Let me know if there’s anything that should be changed that the server could benefit from. You can find the server’s IP address below if you have trouble finding it in the server browser.

This becomes very annoying when someone is employing the ""run away from anyone who so much as looks at me and try to find people to stab in the back"" method of accruing kills. Of course, if you are playing as a faster class this isn't as much of an issue, but playing as a knight in FFA anyone you fight can choose to run away from you at any time and have a decent chance of succeeding (assuming there is no speed boost from targeting.)

**To the point:** Is there a speed boost in FFA mode? And, if not, should it be implemented or left alone, and what reasoning is there for either option?",,False,,t5_2vb9k,False,,,True,t3_1ahvbk,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1ahvbk/regarding_the_ffa_mode_and_speed_boost_from/,

1. Do the tutorial, or at least part of it. It's really helpful. In 20 minutes or less you can get the basics of every class and you will have a much better time in multiplayer once you've got the basics down. 

2. Max out your field of vision (under video/graphics settings). It may seem strange at first but after a round or 2 you won't be able to go back to anything less.

3. If you're injured, go chill and crouch. You'll be back on your feet in no time. It may be an inconvenience but it's better than getting killed, waiting up to 15 seconds for a respawn, then having to run all the way back to the battle. 

4. After you've mastered the basics, learn to feint. It seems complicated and intimidating at first, I know, but with just a few hours of practice you'll have it down and be able to effectively engage way more players. I can honestly say a successful strike after a feint is one of the most satisfying feelings in the game, you won't regret your time spent learning it. Far to few players utilize feinting. 

Welp, it's late here in CA and I just wanted to put that out there and hopefully help out a couple noobs. I'm know there's stuff I missed, feel free to add anything in the comments or retort anything I said.

I've been playing Chivalry for 2 weeks and i find this game very interesting and challenging but there are lots of things i don't understand. I've been looking for some answers but i didn't find much about.

In one hand, i noticed some hit ""stun"" you and you can't block for a few seconds, any idea how to do this ? 

In the other hand, when i sometimes hit an enemy his attack movement don't stop and he hit me back. Does somebody have an explanation ?

I like playing man at war without a shield and preferably with an axe (I'm prouder when I kill a vanguard !) but I have some strafe trouble, I sometimes strafe without double taping the key and without using the strafe button. Is there a way to remove the double taping strafe mode ?

I've experienced some trouble to kill people, and they sometimes hit me once while I hit them 3 or 4 times. I've checked the Damage values and i guess it's because i don't try to hit the head. Are the damage values from the links in damage percent ?

I sometimes think people playing with vanguard do weird thing like starting a shot and then move their mouse all around them and kill me even if I'm not in the line of the weapon. Is it just me or does it really happen?

Thanks for helping a noob to be a better warrior :D 

PS1 : Sry, English is not my mother language
PS 2 : if you are an archer, a good one, let me eat you brain and get your strength cause I have no idea how you do to be strong ! 
EDIT : PS3 : if you have any advice feel free to give it :p

EDIT 2 : Noob TIPS resume

**How to stun ?** 

* As a Vanguard you can stun with the Sprint attack 
* As everyone hit your enemy when he is winding up. If you hit him to late he won't we either stun nor interrupt.
* (Block without stamina ) Need confirmation here

**How many hit do i need to kill someone ?**

It depend of a lots of thing : 

* Your weapon
* The attack type
* His armor
* Where do you hit him
For further explanation check [the Damage Values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ami8d_HZmYHsdDRzc1Byb3ItVWNXSFR1SURHN29TZnc#gid=1) (not my work but thx to this man!)

**How to parry efficiently ?**

* Look at the tip of your enemy weapon

Hey everyone! Welcome to our Friday Update, where we tell you what we’ve been up to and maybe, just maybe what’s to come! Friday Updates include any information that have to do with Torn Banner Studios and Chivalry: Medieval Warfare.

1) **Beta Patch**:  We were trying to get CU1 Patch 3 Beta 2 out to you guys today, but there were some issues with it that weren’t able to get resolved by the end of the day, so that’s why this Friday Update is out so late. Brady has been working feverishly on this, so expect to see this out early next week. Here are some of the changes so you know what’s to come:

* Stamina drain from successfully parrying attacks slightly reduced.
* Vanguard primary weapon knockback values toned down.
* Two-hander flinch duration down from 1.1 to 1.0.
* Special daze duration down from 2 to 1.8.
* Crossbow projectile speeds are lower, and the difference between light and heavy crossbow is less drastic.
* Corrected Bardiche sprint attack being .15 faster than other sprint attacks.
* Flail overhead windup from .55 to .5.
* Heavy Flail overhead windup from .6 to .55.
* Spear slash windup from .425 to .475.
* Spear stab windup from .575 to .6.
* Brandistock slash windup from .45 to .5.
* Brandistock stab windup from .55 to .6.

2) **Micro Transactions**: If you’ve been paying attention to the beta app and been playing around with customization, you will notice that you can purchase helmets. As everything on the beta is for testing purposes only, you will NOT be charged if you attempt to go through with the transaction. You will get a message from Steam thanking you for your purchase and that funds have been deducted, however funds have not really been deducted. If you encounter any issues, please send an email to kimiko@tornbanner.com with the time of your transaction and Steam ID and we will look into the problem. So please test out the micro transactions at your convenience and let us know in the Beta Feedback forum how it’s working out and any issues you come across. (Please wait until CU1 P3 B2 is released next week to begin testing this out)

3) **Steam Summer Sale**:  The Steam Summer Sale will be continuing until July 22 and Chivalry has been on sale the entire time at 50% off, with a Daily Deal and Flash Sales at 75% off. So if you’ve missed out in the past, you definitely want to take advantage of the discount during this sale. 

4) **Ask TBS!**: Just a reminder that we WILL answer questions in the Ask TBS! section of our forums. It’s just a matter of getting the answers to you when we have them. So if it seems like we’re never answering, we will! As you can see, a lot of questions have been answered recently, so take a look if you have asked a question in the past to see if we tackled yours.",News,False,,t5_2vb9k,False,,,True,t3_1io8s9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1io8s9/friday_update_what_were_up_to_july_19_2013/,

Hi everyone! Welcome to our Friday Update, where we tell you things we’ve worked on and maybe, just maybe things to come!

* **Steam Summer Sale**:  As you can see, the Steam Summer Sale is now in effect. With this comes all sorts of great deals and Chivalry is one of them. During this time, Chivalry will be on sale at varying amounts, but for today only, Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is on Steam’s Daily Deals, right at the top, for 75% off - the lowest we have ever been, so take advantage of this awesome deal!

* **Steam Trading Cards**:  Chivalry finally has trading cards! We’ve all been waiting for this and the time has come! Just play the game and you will randomly get some cards. For others, you’ll need to trade with friends or purchase from the Market. Here are some examples of some of the cards you can earn!

* **What’s to come**: No hotfixes or anything this week, but we might have an update next week for the next beta patch. Everything is looking good. Keep playing around with the SDK and the customization. Any feedback on Rcon would be helpful as well.

**Thanks and see you next week!**

In general, I'm quite impressed with the balance of all the classes, and am heartened to see the devs are actively tweaking things with the Beta and gathering feedback. 

Here's something I've been thinking about Archers, and I'm curious what the vet's around here think:

Currently, a good archer seems to earn about half his kills in melee fighting with that wicked, neck-stabbing dagger, or some other knifey-knife. Don't get me wrong -- I find meleeing as an archer tremendous fun -- but it kinda feels like we just have two MAA classes, one with a bow instead of a shield.

What if they upped the damage of all arrows, but further nerfed the Archer's close combat abilities, just by making him weaker. Either lower hitpoints, or slower, or both. I think this would make archers spend more time carefully finding postitions to support their team and defend objectives, and less time sprinting into the middle of furballs and slashing knives in everyone's faces. 

As an Archer I want to hit hard from a distance, but I think I should be summarily slaughtered if the wave of combat washes over me, and I can't get out in time.

Thoughts?

I generally try to do the same, though perhaps with less success. But once in a blue moon, I come across players who seem *too* good to be true. Let me explain.

I think most people have seen blatant movement speed hackers; people who zoom around the map at the speed of light, or MAAs who can span chasms with their dodges. These are not the players to whom I'm referring.

The people I'm referring to move at a normal speed; their attacks are blockable; they can be stunned, they can wounded, and they can be killed. Just like everyone else. But sometimes it seems like their weapons are... faster than you'd expect. Their two-handers have the speed of broadswords, their broadswords the speed of short swords, etc. It's subtle enough that you're always doubting whether it's real or whether you're just imagining it. But the longer you play against them, the more you feel that they DO swing faster, and that their attacks are *much* harder to block than those of other players using an identical weapon.

Now I realize there's lots of reasons certain players might have attacks that are difficult to block. Or why they might seem to swing so fast. Off the top of my head:

1. They make excellent use of combos
2. They drag-swing, changing the aim of their attack mid-swing
3. They use look-down overheads
3. They use the parry-feint technique (which I've never figured out)
4. They time their attacks exceptionally well
6. They're using a particularly fast version of their weapon category
5. They're lagging


But even taking all this into account, I still feel there are some players whose weapon attack speed is consistently faster than should be possible. I've seen lots of comments on it in game by other players as well (though this could certainly be people mistaking skill for speedhacks, or pure groupthink), and I've seen people get votekicked for it.

So what do you guys think? Is it possible to use hacks to slightly increase the swing speed of a weapon, and do people do it? Have you seen this in game as well? Have you ever voted yes in a votekick that was based on the assumption of weapon speed hacking?",,False,,t5_2vb9k,1369184537.0,,,True,t3_1esrxt,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1esrxt/the_subtle_yet_deadly_hacks_do_they_exist/,

1.  The run button.  Yes, I know there is 'toggle run' but thats not what I'm looking for.  I expect my character to just *fucking* run when i have shift held down.  So many things will cancel the run for no good reason and it's really stupid to have to release and then repress shift just to enable running again.  I understand getting hit with an arrow should stagger you for a second, but you should automatically start running again afterwards if you still have shift pressed.

2.  The input queuing seems... glitchy.  This is a pretty frustrating issue because it can be hard to tell if its just you, the game, your mouse.. or what the hell is causing it.  However, I can't count the number of times where I have only thrown two combos instead of three even though I've been constantly scrolling the mousewheel the entire time.  Or somehow I'll throw out an extra attack even though I swear I only scrolled the wheel once.  I even had one time where I threw an overhead when I hadn't touched the scroll wheel at all.  This happens sometimes with blocking too.

3.  Mouse sensitivity changing randomly.  Once again, this can be frustrating cause sometimes I'm not sure if I'm just going crazy or what but seemingly at random, the mouse sensitivity seems to go wayyyy down for no reason.  I was noticing this quite a bit the other day while swinging the maul.  I thought it was my mouse at first but I haven't noticed this in any other game.

4.  Flinching seems to be improved since the patch but I'm pretty sure that there is still some problems with it.  E.g. I hit someone with a fast one hander and they are able to wind up a two hander attack and hit me  before I can hit them again (the combination of this and combos not queuing up when i want them two leads to much anger).",,False,,t5_2vb9k,False,,,True,t3_17vhij,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/17vhij/anyone_else_experience_these_problems/,

1. Most of the time enemies try to chop your head off on the second swing, if you feel blocking is overrated try crouch dodge it LIKE A BOSS

2. Don't swing your main weapon in 2v1 situation, use stab/vertical stab. Otherwise you may kill your teammates as well (Especially Vanguards)

3. Man at arms' fire bomb can also be used to burn down objectives

4. You can sometimes fire two consecutive shots with balista if you keep left clicking

5. When playing archer and someone like vanguard or knight try to kill you, don't panic. Try to use your dagger/shortsword to block his first strike, get REALLY close, run around him in circle and swing your weapon as hard as you can
 
6. Try shoot the knees when enemies are using shield.

7. When using bow, predict which way will  your enemy go. People tend to head forward when their swing hit someone, and head backward if they are hit by someone",,False,,t5_2vb9k,False,,,True,t3_123sfo,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/123sfo/advance_combat_what_ive_learn_so_far/,

There is a long delay between throwing a javelin, and when it is ""reloaded,"" and I think this is right and proper so that missile attacks aren't spammed.

However, this means that after throwing, it takes a really really long time to be able to block because you have to wait to reload the javelin before you can block, unless weapons are switched.

The javelin is already very difficult to use / master, but I think this would help reduce the frustration in playing this character.

I end up joining a clan with some of the same people, and even still play with the non-clan guys now, 6 months later.

It was an awesome way to learn the game and meet other people to chop heads off with.

This is really just planned as drop in - drop out session for fun and I only expect a few people to be on at any given time, so don't expect a big event with lights and fireworks. We have a TeamSpeak server as well.

If you wanna join messege myself here on reddit or steam(same name on each) or In_Dying_Arms on reddit (ApocalypteK on steam). ",,False,,t5_2vb9k,False,,,True,t3_12irpm,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/12irpm/chivalry_clan_event_tonight/,

There are elements that I love - like the fantastic map design, the impressive production values, the atmosphere, and the feeling of rushing into battle. But I can't stand the gameplay mechanics. FPS melee only really worked for me in two games - Riddick and Condemned. And both of those relied on the melee as a form of tension and/or vulnerability.

I started to do well and get into the zone at the two hour mark, got about a dozen kills in all, and it clicked...but that only lasted for about ten minutes. After that it was back to getting beheaded and blindsided going into every battle. Seriously, no matter what I tried (changing up tactics/weapons/classes), I would die immediately. Should I stick with it? I mean, it took me a while to ""get"" TF2, but at least I was having fun playing it...this game just pisses me off.

Here's how this clan works: 

We are a clan by name, yes, but we prefer to look at this as a brotherhood. There is nobody more in charge than anybody else. All members have equal say, all members have equal priviledge. With this comes equal responsbility, trust, and the development of a clan we can all be proud to be a part of. 

We are a clan with new ideas and a lot of energy. More importantly we are clan of people that are quite good at the game Chivalry. That's why you're here, and why we're here; To play with good people to further our own skill and to bolster the skills of others. What you bring to the table in that regards is on you, as it is with everyone else. But overall, we are a family. And I suggest we treat each other as such. That being said, however, we are a clan that strongly values organization and obedience, and we expect all of our members to listen to their superiors when on the battlefield (only during competitive matches, of course) 

Lastly, as most clans need to use this schtick, we're going to also say that we do plan on being respectful. We intend on playing in tournaments and against other clans competitively, as such we can't have ridiculous slander or negative behavior making all of us look bad. 

That aside, you're a brother now or will be one soon. Divide et Impera, Divide and Conquer 

More info:
Where: USA, server located in NYC
Requirements: 

-must be nice

-must have mic/be willing to talk

-must have mumble (if you don't know what that is, don't worry)

-must be good

-must be willing to scrim

We have a 16 slot server and a 15 slot mumble server until the payment runs out on it, at which point we will buy a new one. Same location, same provider, same slots, same features.

You can click all three buttons yourself or you could edit the config file to do it for you:

documents/chivalry/config -&gt; open UDKGame.ini  -&gt; go very bottom where your keybinds are saved. 

find RightMouseButton  -&gt; it should say GBA_Parry|GBA_Raiseshield|GBA_MeleeFeint| and so on 

Delete meleefeint and the bar separating each command. Add GBA_Feint in front of GBA_Parry and put a bar between the two. 

What this does is if you press RMB, the game will feint out of your swing and parry immediately. You just have to always queue a combo before pressing RMB to eliminate any recovery time.

Now the downside to this is you cannot use your RMB for feint. Use a different button for feint (i use Q and E both for diff. walking direction and i use G for Use because you never really use 'Use' anyways)

This trick will save your life on countless occasions. This is especially useful for slower weapons. This is why those more experienced players seem to be able to block all of your swings.

I'm also marking the objective points with stars and ammo crates with gold boxes. Stationary weapons like catapults are boxes colored for the team who should use it.

The numbers next to the flags show spawn/objective order.

Now that I have a good feel for the game, I want to share my thoughts on aspects of the game that people seem to like, not like, or maybe aspects people haven't really mentioned before.

*Pre-patch vs post-patch Combat*

When I first started playing, I was having a great time but this was a major topic in a lot of games that I joined. And it really dampened my spirit as a new player. The way people were making it seem, the game was now dumbed down and worthless. I've read up on people's opinions about the patch changes and I have a gist of what is different, but it's hard to grasp. All I can really say here is that from a new perspective on the game, the post-patch balance and combat system works very well. Combat is very fluid and doesn't feel like I have to ""exploit"" it to better my opponent. Classes have strengths and weaknesses, but good players can hold their own and pick of the slack of their class as well as expanding the on class' strength, allowing them to really stand out in the battle. But, the ""dumbed down"" game's sporting of decent noobs adds a good static level of balance to the matches and players, so you can still get your ass handed to you if you step out of line.

*Customization*

Am I the only one around here who doesn't have a problem telling the difference between Agatha and Mason Order? Seriously, the amount of people raging about the color customization is concerning. The only time I attack the wrong team is when they are covered in blood and look red (and even that happens rarely, pay attention to the cursor), but I did that pre-patch anyway. I think the customization is fantastic and I hope they expand on it.

*Game Modes and Maps*

I want more game modes! Steal some ideas from CoD - I don't care :P. But seriously, I'm having a blast in all the game modes. All of them. What I do want to see are bigger maps and larger objectives. For instance, game modes where there are points to capture and hold around the map and maps big enough where there are different ways to move about to these points. I think some wooded maps would be fantastic and more open maps like Moor (spelling?) would be really awesome if they also incorporated flanking paths on the sides that people could fight through. I dunno. Thoughts?

*Closing Thoughts*

I'd like to be able to bind some of the commands (like Yes, No, Thanks, etc) to the numpad. I don't have a problem with the community, I think it has a healthy balance of nice people and stupid people, which works for this game because you get to chop stupid people's heads off and vote kick is used constantly. I think a lack of stats being kept (like kills/deaths and all that CoD stuff) keeps the game from getting too stressful, but I wouldn't mind if they added stats. Oh, and I would pay a lot of money for killcams. 

Well, I think that's all I had to say. It's 2am here, so I probably missed something, but I'll check in the morning and see. Please share you thoughts on what I said and/or add input of your own on how the game could be improved.

During this weekend I decided to get my hands to the dreaded Bearded Axe to fully realize how ridiculous it was.

Boy I was not disapointed. This thing is a chopping machine. 

The axe has good damage, insane speed on the overhead, but the real deal is that you can really abuse game mechanics to transform you into a automated chopping machine.

[See for yourself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl_QHBf7iqo&amp;feature=youtu.be)


Quite fast aye? As soon as I connect a hit, and provided I don't hit the floor which would prevent me from comboing, I immedialty combo and then I cancel my combo, and launch an overhead immediately after. You have your super attack

This second attack can be blocked but there is a difference between possibility and parrying rate. It is FAST, and you have to know the opponent is going to do it to properly parry it.
If you don't you are almost assured to eat the second strike. On top of that it can desync the attack as you saw in the video. (~0.29 sec of the video)

Right now in the game if you feint your attack at the last second, or almost at the same time as the release of the weapon, your attack animation become desync, or sometimes ghost.

The weapon becomes of course worse when you feint, whether it is at the beginning, during your combo or after. In this patch you can much more easily see feints it requires a clear head and training. But try to have a clear head when you know fast strikes from the mad chopper are coming fast and two shot you (knights also if one hit hits the head)


We wanted to do this video to raise the awareness about this weapon. You do feel like a chop machine. It does not guarantee victory every time (try to hit a good MAA with it, or a spear vanguard) but it quite does help you a lot. 


Something MUST be done to fix this. I confess I do not have a solution, but I guess you have to know an issue before solving it.

Slow blocking and hitting. I honestly feel like I'm playing a different game. Also, I disagree with them making when you get stunned from having no stamina last longer. One can basically run up and annihilate you, and you have no stamina either! It's near impossible not to block an attack. I feel like this relies too heavily on feinting and dragging to work well, and I strongly disagree with the combat alterations on this patch. 




Also, double axe is so OP.

EDIT: There are some things I agree with that i should note. I like the kicking as well as the weapon changes (mostly). Although Knight's sword arsenal is kinda ruined (here come the claymore vanguards), the other weapons seem fine.
