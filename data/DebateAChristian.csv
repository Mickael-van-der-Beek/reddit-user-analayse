1374329307.0,86,self.DebateAChristian,1ip0tz,Fellow Christians: it's time for some tough love!,agrum_citrus,115,29,221,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/1ip0tz/fellow_christians_its_time_for_some_tough_love/,"I understand this is a debate subreddit, so please bare with my, I will make the debate topic clear after the introduction.

I found this subreddit a week ago and I've been lurking and learning the rules.

I've noticed there have been a few posts regarding the lack of Christian participation and Christian hurt feelings and claims that Christians are being persecuted within /r/DebateAChristian/. **As a Christian, I call bull-shit on this! And here's why:**

**TO CHRISTIANS**

* From an atheist's perspective, we are adults that believes in pixie-dust and magic. This is our opportunity to undermine that prejudicial view and demonstrate our patience, grace and intellect. We are not a victim of persecution, we are participating in a debate because we choose to. We can walk away at any time.

* Let's get one thing clear: God has NOT been definitively proven to exist and you can not pretend otherwise during rational debate!

* We are receiving down-votes because our debate arguments are often unsubstantiated. We are being ridiculed because rational debate ends once we make these unsubstantiated claims (which typically presumes that Christianity can be proven). **This is THE key issue.** If we want to be taken seriously, let's start presenting serious arguments that can be substantiated with facts and rationale.

* If you are not an expert in ancient Hebrew or Greek and you do not have access to the original Old Testament or New Testament then **DO NOT CLAIM THAT YOUR BIBLICAL INTERPRETATIONS ARE MORE CORRECT THAN SOMEONE ELSE'S** *(unless you can actually substantiate it)* because you can not substantiate your claim. You will be down-voted, you will be ridiculed and you deserve it!

* Debate arguments and rebuttals need to be rational. We deserve to be ridiculed (within a debate) if our argument are unsubstantiated such as ""because the bible tells me so"" or ""because God can do no wrong"" or ""Jesus died for our sins"" etc.

* I am sick of Christian whining about being persecuted and how the /r/DebateAChristian is unfair. Stop your complaining and present some decent, compelling, rational arguments in support of your faith that are not supernatural and you **WILL** receive up-votes, or do not participate! We can not expect non-believers to respect our unsubstantiated religious views within a debate unless we can present a decent argument in support of said claims!

* Remember that we will not die from hurt feelings.

**TO ATHEISTS**

* Nobody has proven nor disproved the existence of God. It is irrational to claim to know of sure, one way or the other. Please keep this in mind when forming your rebuttal.

* If you are interested in having a serious debate, consider letting Christians know if we are making unsubstantiated claims that are unacceptable outside of our social circles and unacceptable within a debate. If we continue to make unsubstantiated claims within the debate, feel free to ridicule us because we deserve it for not following the expected intellectual discipline of a debate!

**MY DEBATE QUESTION**

I think Christianity in particular is a good example of this, as in Ancient Rome only a handful of people were Christians and they were often persecuted for their beliefs. Only after hundreds of years after Jesus Christ did it start getting recognized as a religion.

An omnipotent and omniscient God knows **exactly** what it would take for me to be convinced of his existence. But would this be equal to *forcing* me to believe? I reply this is nonsense. God knew that you would believe, based on whatever evidence happened to have convinced you eg. the bible. Did God force you to believe in him, because he inspired a book and you accepted it as truth? What evidence would therefore be acceptable and would not count as ""forcing"" me to believe?

1317503863.0,41,self.DebateAChristian,kxsc1,Why I abandoned Christianity after spending a year at a Bible college where I finally read the whole Bible (x-post from r/atheism),JimmyTango,52,11,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/kxsc1/why_i_abandoned_christianity_after_spending_a/,"In the interest of allowing my ideas to be challenged any way possible, I'm posting this here and on r/christianity.

  When I went to a Christian College we read the ""Old Testament"" in the order the Jewish people read them (TaNaKh, Torah, Nevi'm, Ketuvim, Torah, Prophets, Writings) and it was pretty damn clear to me at that time the central concern at all times was the preservation of their land. Nothing more. In fact the end of the Hebrew canon is closed by a recap of Jewish history in 1 and 2 Chronicles, and after reading a giant back and forth of the Jewish people living and getting expelled from Palestine, it ends with the Persian King Cyrus making a ""happy ending"" and giving the land back to the Isaelites and rebuilding the temple destroyed by the Babylonians, making him a proto-messiah. As a Christian that is such an alien concept, tying the Messiah to a physical act of regaining land, and stuck out like a sore thumb for me. But when you think about the coming history of Israel, specifically the Alexandrian conquest and Greek rule, things start to fall into place.

  What's really interesting was how the Old Testament came to be reordered. Alexandrian king Ptolemy the II oversaw the height of literary achievement and thus commissioned a greek translation of the Hebrew text from occupied Palestine. Now the Talmud (Jewish oral history/exploration of laws, life, etc.) contends that miraculously 72 Jewish scholars were set in 72 separate rooms and asked to each translate the Torah (first 5 books) from Hebrew to Greek and all 72 translations were exactly the same via Divine inspiration. This is obviously a ""history of the victor/editor"" hyperbole. The rest took about 200 years to be completed, far after Ptolemy and the influence of Hellenism in Judea into the Herodian occupation which continued through the times of Jesus. We can tell the standards of transliteration were becoming more flexible as time went on. The Septuagint incorporates texts that were not in the original canon of the Tanakh and are known now as Apocryphal, almost wholly rejected by the Protestant church. 

  While the exact reasoning for the reordering of the text is not known, its no wonder the Septuagint ends with the prophets/philosophers of the Jewish Canon instead of the history of occupation and expulsion of the Jewish people when you consider the prophets are some of the most philosophical and poetic writings in the Old Testament and emphasizing them at the end of the canon would appease to the hellenistic occupiers commissioning the translation. This becomes the precedent for Christ and the Christian church to reinterpret the Old Testament under the lens of Platonic ideation and dualism as opposed to the very literal and pointed focus of the Jewish text on the importance of 1 god having 1 people on 1 piece of land. Christianity never would have spread to the rest of the Mediterranean world without some Platonic adaptation because it would not have been accessible to Hellenistic cultures. What's more, its a simple law of economy: Judaism is by its nature exclusionary, whilst Christianity, with a god of the universe, as opposed to god of the strip of eastern Mediterranean coastline, is capable of opening its arms to everyone. Undoubtedly that's what Constantine must have found most useful about the religion after he relaxed the laws against Christianity with the edict of Milan. Despite the fact that he maintained a more pluralistic approach to religion in the empire early on, later in his reign he was going as far as North Africa to judge over doctrinal disputes of theology and even waging war to impose his decrees. The council of Nicea becomes very important politically to consolidating power in a reign plagued by rebellion and civil war and what we know as Christianity today stems from these very unchristian motivations.

  Thus, **tl;dr** the Old Testament is nothing more than a real estate manifesto, cobbled together by a culture trying to defend themselves and their land from invasion after invasion, and Christianity is simply a platonic expansion of that text based on a loose translation into greek with political/philosophical edits which are later imposed by a politically motivated board charged with forming consistent doctrine for the Roman emperor trying to maintain control of an expansive and divisive empire.",,False,,t5_2ryd5,True,,,True,t3_kxsc1,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/kxsc1/why_i_abandoned_christianity_after_spending_a/,
1371319044.0,39,self.DebateAChristian,1gera8,I don't understand Jesus's sacrifice. It seems irrelevant in the context of who's making the sacrifice.,EpsilonRose,44,5,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/1gera8/i_dont_understand_jesuss_sacrifice_it_seems/,"So, the sacrifice of Jesus is something that has bugged me for a while. Recently I've been discussing it with a few people on /r/DebateReligion and this has prompted me to bring my question here in the hopes of getting a good answer.

The basic gist of my problem is as follows: It is often claimed that god sacrificed Jesus for our sins and, beyond that, that it was a major sacrifice on his part, so we should be greatful. Often phrases like ""God sacrificed his only begotten son for your sins"" and ""extreme personal sacrifice"" are used to describe the event and explain how people feel about it. Unfortunately, neither of those phrases seem to accurately describe what happened. While it can easily be argued, if you believe in Christianity, that we should be grateful for the result of the sacrifice, the sacrifice itself seems rather trivial. To my eyes, there are four major problems with the sacrifice. The first three have to do with its nature and the final one has to do with it's context. I would greatly appreciate hearing people's thoughts on this matter.

---

**First is the issue of scale.**  
God is credited with creating the universe. That means, at a minimum, his view spans from the beginning of the universe, 13.77 **Billion** years ago, to the present (or the time of Jesus, if you prefer, a couple thousand years isn't worth much on this scale). Jesus lived for about 30 years. This represents 2.179E-7%, or .00000002179%, of his existence. If we were to put this on a human scale, that's only 5.429 **seconds**, if we use the average life expectancy of an American citizen (79 years according to Wikipedia). Of course, that uses the whole of a human's lifespan. The universe, and presumably god, isn't anywhere close to dieing. Similarly, it counts the whole of Jesus's life, not just his time on the cross. If we were to change either of those assumptions, god's sacrifice would count for even less time.  

**Next is scope.**  
As an omniscient entity, God's awareness covers things as small as quantum strings, as large as galaxies, as tranquil as interstellar space or a barren planet (with atmosphere), and as violent as a solar system getting destroyed by an exploding star. I find it hard to believe that mortal humans, especially during Jesus's time, could create or experience events that would be described as 'extreme' when taken on that stage. I could certainly understand calling the experience unpleasant, but but only in a mildly less than neutral way. When cosmic level events are included, I can think of plenty of things that would be worse than getting nailed to a cross and, by definition, an omniscient being should know what it's like to experience those things.

**After that, there's the issue of permanency.**  
Normally, god's sacrifice of Jesus is compared to a father sacrificing his only son for a cause. The problem with that is, when a father sacrifices his son, it is a permanent thing. This is explicitly not the case with god and Jesus. In fact, one of the central tenants of Christianity is that god promptly undid the loss by resurrecting Jesus and bringing him back home.

---
**Summary of first three issues.**  
God's sacrifice of Jesus only looks like an extreme personal sacrifice if we judge it as if god were a human. If we actually take the time to put it into perspective, it becomes a relatively short and unremarkable event with no permanent drawbacks.

In that light, it's more akin to a father sneaking up behind his son and shouting 'Boo!' for someone else's amusement than anything else.  

Personally, I don't find that a particularly impressive 'sacrifice'.

---
**The final issue is a matter of context.**  
God is sacrificing Jesus to modify a situation that he created and to change his own policies. Hell and sin were both created by god and the judging of a human life is supposedly god's domain. Asking someone to be grateful for that is like asking someone to be grateful for Steve Jobs paying Steve Jobs to change the iTunes drm policy. While you might be able to legitimately claim people should be grateful for the change in policy, claiming they should be grateful for the payments made is utter nonsense. Regardless of how much is being paid, it is coming from and going to the same person.",,False,,t5_2ryd5,False,,red brackets,True,t3_1gera8,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/1gera8/i_dont_understand_jesuss_sacrifice_it_seems/,

Not explicitly Jesus, but the idea that the Messiah will be Godly is antithetical to Judaism. [Chapter 1](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904960/jewish/Chapter-One.htm)

The Messiah will be a warrior king.  He will be a human, born of a *young woman*, and will **not die and come back as he will have a mortal life span to fulfill the prophecies.**  As per [Bar Kochba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kochba), who was thought to be the Messiah.  [Once he died](http://imgur.com/a/N1kbb), the Rabbis shrugged and said ""I guess it was not him"".  So the Messiah must be alive in order to fulfill the prophecies.

""Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves."" (John 14:11)

Presumably we are to believe the hearsay reports of these miracles and conclude that Jesus was who he said he was. But none of the gospels were written by eyewitnesses.

Christians point to another primary ""proof"" of Jesus' identity as God and Messiah: the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. But anyone could have written Jesus stories to ""fulfill"" Old Testament prophecies.

Is there anything else that Jesus could have done (short of never leaving Earth) to ""prove"" he was God?

Jesus could have uttered some prophecies that would not be revealed until hundreds of years later. 

Jesus could have made some general comments about how it is that the earth orbits the sun in a solar system consisting of nine planets. He could have mentioned gravity, germ theory, Evolution or genetics. He could have given some medical advice that would not be verified by the scientific method until hundreds of years later. But he did nothing like any of these things. Why is that?

Jesus expected people to believe he was God based on a few parlor tricks. But imagine what a real miracle it would be if a 1st century Judean revealed scientific information that would not be verified until hundreds of years later. Imagine what a slam dunk it would be for Christianity if the creator of the universe revealed just a few of his secrets hundreds of years before they were discovered by humans. Imagine how many more souls would be saved. 

But Jesus didn't reveal any special knowledge of the natural world. Instead, Jesus appeared, for all intents and purposes to be a man of his time who knew no more about biology, astronomy or physics than any other man on the street in 1st century Judea. Why is that?

Please don't respond with, ""but nobody would have understood what he meant"". We *still* don't know what the Book of Revelation means. And we teach Evolution to grade-school children. *Someone* in the 1st century would have acquired a rudimentary grasp of the Theory of Evolution if the greatest communicator who ever lived deigned to talk about it. After all, Hellenistic people already knew about Aristotle's idea of the Great Chain of Being.

As an atheist I believe that I have as much right to publicly express my views on religion as the Pope does.  However most Christians do not seem to see it this way - that if you do not believe then it is somehow ""disrespectful"" or ""offensive"" to say so.  Why is this?

I realise that most christians on DaC are not like this, but I would welcome some insight into the minds of the ""Christian in the street"" that you could give.  Are their beliefs so shallow that just knowing that someone does not share them threatens their whole world-view?  Is it more offensive for an atheist to tell a Christian that god does not exist than for a Christian to tell an atheist that he does?",,False,,t5_2ryd5,False,,,True,t3_hxp5e,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/hxp5e/why_are_atheists_labelled_as_militant_for/,

3. It could not be logically adapted to support any other religion

Do any such arguments exist?

**Edit**: So maybe I could have formulated this question a little better. Specifically, I've come to think of the third criteria as flawed. Nevertheless, it's spawned an awful lot of fascinating conversations, and I now have a few books to read.

But even with the flawed third criteria, I genuinely don't understand why this is so difficult to do if Christianity is verifiable and demonstrably true. The very best theist arguments never seem to focus on proving their particular religions true; rather, their energies are devoted to proving atheists wrong. And even were they to succeed in that task, it would merely prove that one of the thousands of known religions, or some entirely undiscovered one, is the truth. It wouldn't prove their own religions.

It's a really good question though, IMO.  

If your religious beliefs are based on ""faith"", then do you understand that that means that the supernatural claims you're making are no more reasonable than me saying that I believe in Scientology based on ""faith,"" or that I believe that Steve Jobs is God, based on ""faith""?

When adding to that the fact that the Bible is full of atrocities and contradictions, I honestly don't understand how people could possible believe or want to believe in Christianity.  And I'm not trying to say that in a condescending way, what I mean is that I've never been a Christian, so I honestly don't know what it's like, or how it's possible.  

But seriously, how is it possible to not see how malevolent your God is?  He has complete control on whether people go to Heaven or Hell (assuming he is all-powerful, as the Bible claims), yet he lets people go to Hell anyways.  Do Christians truly believe that people deserve to go to hell?  There are VERY FEW people I've ever heard of that would deserve such torture.  I certainly don't think I deserve the same kind of torture that Hitler deserved (even though, he might be in Heaven, seeing as how he was a Roman Catholic...)

So that's it?  You'll end up in one of two places?  One is unimaginatively fantastic, and the other is unimaginatively terrible?  There's no middle ground?

But there is a lot of good that comes out of being in the klan! A sense of community. A sense of belonging to something bigger than yourself.

They stand behind states rights, and they strongly support veterans.
Just because a few radical individuals did some terrible things in the past in the name of the Klan, that has nothing to do with how the Klan is today! Besides, those people weren't true Klansmen. A real, modern Klansman would never act like that!
I can call myself a Klansman, even though I don't agree with everything they believe in. And I still go to a few Klan meetings each year, even though I disagree with some of their core tenets. I like the ceremonies, and some of the songs. I'm just choosing the parts that I like, and I'm going to with that, while I ignore the parts of The Klan that I disagree with.

""...Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Chrestians by the populace. Chrestus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus,...""

(Tacitus, Annals, 116 AD, book 15, chapter 44)

Christian apologists like to believe that ""Chrestians"" and ""Chrestus"" in the above text are just insignificant mispellings. But the earliest copy of the Bible in existence, the Codex Sinaiticus, *also* refers to the followers of Jesus as ""Chrestians"".

""As to the ancient manuscripts, they all have the word in all three places and their testimony is identical – with one critical exception. The best and earliest codex of all, Sinaiticus, has instead of Christianoi (Xristianoi/), Chrestianoi (Xrhstianoi/) – and it has this reading in all three places where the word occurs.  Therefore it is impossible, in spite of the Nestle-Aland tentative suggestion for Acts 26:28, for it to be an itacism (i.e., a popular misspelling based on third/fourth century shifts in pronunciation, something of which this manuscript is, it is true, replete). For one thing, I find no parallel for changing a long ""i"" (iota) to a long ""e"" (eta) in this manuscript (and the unusual spelling would not have happened three times by mistake). Equally interesting is the fact that **in all three cases, the right vertical stroke and the horizontal stroke of the ETA have been erased to produce an IOTA (yielding the traditional spelling)**. This is very unusual. Sinaiticus was corrected many times, and each generation of correctors had their own discernible ""tics"". But simple erasure without further comment seems to be unprecedented. Moreover, the empty space left by the erasure is, in all three cases, not filled up. This shows that without any question **the scribe of Sinaiticus deliberately meant to write ""Chrestian"" in all three instances; it was not a mistake**. The plot thickens when we consider that two of the earliest secular references to Christianity, Tacitus, Annales 15.4, where Tacitus talks about the Christians being persecuted by Nero as ""Chrestians"", and Suetonius, Claudius 25, referring to Claudius' expulsion of the Jews mentions a certain ""Chrestus"" as responsible, we find precisely the spellings one would predict if these authors (or their sources) were deriving their information from the same tradition which the spelling of Sinaiticus suggests. 

http://ichthys.com/mail-the-name-Christian.htm

The two titles ""Chrestus"" or ""Chrestian"" are referred to in the following written sources: Tertullian (AD 210), The Eighth Sibyl (AD 200), Theophilos of Antioch (AD 170), Marcus (AD 145), Apocalypse of Elijah (AD 100), Suetonius (AD 124) and Tacitus (AD 116). There is even a disputed inscription (now lost) from Pompei (AD 79) that is believed to have contained a reference to this lost title of Jesus.

Again, Christians like to play off the spelling of ""Chrestus"" as an insignificant misunderstanding on the part of pagan Romans. But ""Chrestus"" appears in the earliest Bible we have so ""Chrestus"" *cannot* be an early pagan Roman misunderstanding. ""Chrestus"" is the word early ""Christians"" (Chrestians) used to refer to their god. 

Why is this important?

""Firstly the hero of Marcion's Bible was called Isu Chrestos - not Jesus. An important point here is you don't see ""Jesus Christ"" in second century texts. So in the Bible of Marcion of Sinope ""Isu Chrestos"" appears instead of ""Christ"" and ""Jesus"". Also in the archaeological fragments mentioned earlier the scribes used the letters ""IS"" wherever Jesus Christ now appears. The inscription ""Isu Chrestos"" can still be seen on the oldest surviving Christian ""Synagogue"" in Syria.

http://www.marcion.info/

Marcion's Jesus appeared full grown on earth during the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius. Marcion's Jesus had no human family and only appeared to be a human being. Marcion's Jesus only ""appeared"" to be crucified. Marcion's Jesus only appeared to die. Marcion's Jesus only appeared to be resurrected. Marcion's Jesus was a god totally separate from the evil Yahweh, whom Marcion referred to as the ""demi-urge"".

The earliest date we have for Marcion is Polycarp's comment that Marcion was teaching in 115 AD. But use of the word ""Chrestus"" precedes Marcion by 65 to 75 years. It would seem, therefore, that the above set of dogma was the original set of orthodox beliefs. How else can we explain the widespread popularity of Marcionism just 23 years after 115 AD, the date Polycarp was willing to admit Marcion arrived on the scene? 

Writing in 138 AD, Justin Martyr said that Marcionites could be found in ""every nation."" Could someone just make up a theological system in his head and 23 years later threaten the primacy of the supposedly established orthodoxy of Catholicism? Marcion *must have* piggy-backed off of a pre-existing theology, the dogma accompanying belief in Chrestus, the god of the Chrestians as long ago as 40 AD...just seven years after the alleged crucifixion of Christ and a good two decades before Paul arrived in Rome.

""Nobody knows how the Church of Rome was established. Neither the Book of Acts nor the writings of the early Fathers explain how Christianity arrived in Rome. As has been discovered, Suetonius, the Roman historian, mentions the **expulsion of followers of Chrestus from Rome, during the time of Emperor Claudius c. AD 40-50**. This indicates that **a flourishing Christian community existed in Rome, even before Paul went to Corinth or Ephesus in AD 49**. By the time of Nero (AD 54-68), the Christian community in Rome was already of a considerable size.""

http://www.firstnewtestament.com/origin_name_christian.htm

Long before Paul, the apostle of the Gentiles, ever went to Rome we find in that city a belief in ""Chrestus"". Chrestus was the god of Marcion

How did ""Christianity"" reach Rome at that very early date and before Paul? 

Could this ""Chrestianity"" referred to by Suetonius be something other than what we have come to understand as Christianity today? 

Could ""Chrestianity"" represent the original orthodoxy of what we now call Christianity?

""According to Clement of Alexandria, Marcion preceded in time all the great Gnostic masters: ""those that invented the heresies"" (The Miscellanies, Book 7, ch. 17. 106f.). That educated scholar from Alexandria (Clement) represents Marcion as an ""elder"" predecessor to two early Gnostic teachers, Valentinus and Basilides. Another heresiarch, Simon Magus, who is often portrayed as the grand father of Gnosticism, also is described by Clement as succeeding Marcion. ""This statement of Clement appears to make Marcion an old man while (Basilides and) Valentinus were still young, and to put Simon Magus posterior to them all in time"" (Robert Smith Wilson. Marcion: A Study of a Second-Century Heretic. James Clarke and Co. Ltd. 1932. p. 56). Clement's chronological data is not being so readily dismissed today, and Marcion's career is being dated to an earlier time than before (Marcion: On the Restitution of Christianity - An Essay on the Development of Radical Paulinist Theology in the Second Century. R. Joseph Hoffmann. Scholars Press 1984).""

http://www.sullivan-county.com/id2/marcion.htm

It would seem that the *earliest* expression of what we call ""Christianity"" was not what we know it to be today. It would appear that once the Catholics gained supremacy, the earliest orthodoxy was repainted as heresy and the heresy of Catholicism was declared to be the original orthodoxy. 

Later Christian scribes literally erased the ""e"" from ""Chrestus"" and ""Chrestianos"" and replaced it with an ""i"". And, as we know, later editions of the Bible replaced ""Chrestus"" with ""Christus"" and ""Chrestianos"" with ""Christianos"".

But, as we have seen, the Catholic church failed to cover all of it's tracks. And now we know why. The Catholics sought to erase all evidence of the original god of Christianity, Chrestos, the God of Marcion.

**TL;DR** If Christians are going to give weight to Tacitus as a historical source and say he is correct and knows what he’s talking about…especially if they are going to say he got his info from authentic governmental documents…then Christians have to also accept that the theology found in Marcionism came *before* the theology found in Catholic orthodoxy. This is because ""Chrestos"" is the god of the Marcionites and ""Christos"" is the god of the Catholics.

This always feels rather anticlimactic for me, especially when the discussion has tried to establish a logically consistent flavor of Christianity, built upon a stable foundation of empirical evidence.  While I can't discredit an individual's personal experience, I feel that the following argument calls into question the conclusion they think it supports.  Dear Christian(s) of DebateAChristian, please consider the following:

**P1.** God is omniscient.  (Some would consider this a consequence of P2, but I find it helpful to state explicitly.)

**P2.** God is omnipotent.  (You may exclude the logically impossible if you like, but it is not a factor in this argument.)

**P3.** God is omnibenevolent; he wishes to have a personal relationship with all of his creations.  (For those of you who object to this premise, I have included an explanation at the end of the post.)

From these premises, we can draw the following conclusions:

**C1.** From P1, God knows how to convince me of his existence.

**C2.** From P2, God is able to convince me of his existence.

**C3.** From P3, God wants to convince me of his existence.

Given that God is willing and able to convince me of his existence, it should be reasonable to conclude that I believe that God exists.  However, I do not believe that God exists.  Given this apparent contradiction, which of my premises and/or conclusions are improperly drawn?  In other words, why has your god failed to provide me with sufficient reason to believe?

To get things going, I'll take a moment to address some of the popular responses to this argument, and explain why I believe they fail to resolve the problem:

* 
*“God has provided you with sufficient evidence, but you refuse to accept it.”*

From P1, we know that God knows that the evidence he has provided is insufficient to convince me to believe.  Thus, it is improper to say that he has provided me with sufficient evidence; this objection is self-refuting.

* 
*“You don't want a personal relationship with God.”*

I assure you that if a divine being exists, I want to know as much about it as possible.  Remember that many atheists (myself included) came to their lack of belief from a sincere desire to strengthen our faith and grow closer with God.  

* 
*“God could not convince you of his existence without violating your free will.”*

If this is the case, then God necessarily violated the free will of the prophets, disciples, early apostles, and the very individual making this objection.  Providing adequate information to make an informed decision is not a violation of free will.

* 
*“P3 is improperly drawn.”*

An omnibenevolent God loves all of his creations.  Without settling on a precise definition of the word “love,” I hope we can agree that eternal damnation in hell is not an expression of love.  Since a personal relationship with God is the only way to escape eternal damnation in hell, we have P3.

This makes no sense to me.

So let’s analyze what this is saying: God makes a bunch of little beings in order to worship him (a [strange idea to begin with]( http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/fkgdz/why_did_god_need_to_make_us/)), gives the beings the ability of logical/rational thinking, then creates doubt about his existence *for the sole purpose of making people doubt him* so he can look down on them for it, favoring those who aren’t swayed by the doubt *that he purposely creates *?

That sounds like a twisted, petty game to me.

Further, I’ve heard the argument, “If he showed himself, we’d just be robots following his orders because there wouldn’t be doubt about him anymore.” First off, isn’t that what Christians are, then? That's bad?

Second, what would be bad about that? We have laws in place that people still break, laws that have not “turned us into robots following the law,” but wouldn’t the world be a better place if people *were* “robots following the law/God”? The “so we aren’t robots” argument again uses a strange “petty game” assumption that God creates doubt around himself *simply so people can act in evil ways.* 

tl;dr: God creates doubt of his existence in people then punishes those who doubt him. Seems like a petty game to me, not a test of virtue.

1297450560.0,32,self.DebateAChristian,fjm6f,A historian's view of how the story of Jesus's resurrection got started.,lanemik,38,6,171,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/fjm6f/a_historians_view_of_how_the_story_of_jesuss/,"This is from [Bart Ehrman's debate with William Lane Craig](http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/p96.htm#EhrmanClose).

&gt;Let me conclude by telling you what I really do think about Jesus' resurrection. The one thing we know about the Christians after the death of Jesus is that they turned to their scriptures to try and make sense of it. They had believed Jesus was the Messiah, but then he got crucified, and so he couldn't be the Messiah. No Jew, prior to Christianity, thought that the Messiah was to be crucified. The Messiah was to be a great warrior or a great king or a great judge. He was to be a figure of grandeur and power, not somebody who's squashed by the enemy like a mosquito. How could Jesus, the Messiah, have been killed as a common criminal? Christians turned to their scriptures to try and understand it, and they found passages that refer to the Righteous One of God's suffering death. But in these passages, such as Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22 and Psalm 61, the one who is punished or who is killed is also vindicated by God. Christians came to believe their scriptures that Jesus was the Righteous One and that God must have vindicated him.

&gt;And so Christians came to think of Jesus as one who, even though he had been crucified, came to be exalted to heaven, much as Elijah and Enoch had in the Hebrew scriptures. How can he be Jesus the Messiah though, if he's been exalted to heaven? Well, Jesus must be coming back soon to establish the kingdom. He wasn't an earthly Messiah; he's a spiritual Messiah. That's why the early Christians thought the end was coming right away in their own lifetime. That's why Paul taught that Christ was the first fruit of the resurrection. But if Jesus is exalted, he is no longer dead, and so Christians started circulating the story of his resurrection. It wasn't three days later they started circulating the story; it might have been a year later, maybe two years. Five years later they didn't know when the stories had started. Nobody could go to the tomb to check; the body had decomposed.

&gt;Believers who knew he had been raised from the dead started having visions of him. Others told stories about these visions of him, including Paul. Stories of these visions circulated. Some of them were actual visions like Paul, others of them were stories of visions like the five hundred group of people who saw him. On the basis of these stories, narratives were constructed and circulated and eventually we got the Gospels of the New Testament written 30, 40, 50, 60 years later.

Christians, is this scenario plausible? Is it likely? Is it *more* likely than the scenario in the Gospels? Why or why not.

My deconversion process was slow and very painful--I cried out to your God to save me, to give me my faith back because I didn't want to lose it. I very much wanted to find anything I could use to hold onto my faith. I studied apologetics because I hoped that would vanquish my doubts--if I only had some good arguments for God I wouldn't lose my faith. Wrong. In fact, those apologetic arguments for God did nothing to validate the Christian God at all. It was funny seeing these Christians such as William Lane Craig using these arguments for God because, even if you accept these arguments as proof that some god exists, it doesn't even come close to proving the God of the Bible exists. The gap between belief in some flavor of god and the God of the Bible is even wider that the one between atheism (non-belief) and belief. In addition, if the arguments somehow proved that God is a possibility, it does nothing for the plausibility for a god existing.

Our beliefs have causes.",CHollman82,39,10,271,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/1egebg/no_one_merely_chooses_what_they_believe_our/,"As the title says. No one merely ""chooses"" to believe in God or not believe in God. No one merely ""chooses"" to believe that Muslims are terrorists, no one merely ""chooses"" to believe that black people are criminals, no one merely ""chooses"" to believe anything that they believe. All of your beliefs have causal determinants, they are all determined by the knowledge that you posses (whether that knowledge is objectively true or not is irrelevant, incorrect knowledge is still knowledge in my usage of the word here). The knowledge that you posses is quite literally the sum of the experiences that you have had during your life.

For example, I do not believe in God, but that is not a mere choice. I cannot on a whim suddenly start being a Christian... I literally cannot merely choose to start believing in God, that would be impossible. I could TELL you that I believe in God, I can lie to everyone about it, but I cannot lie to myself, I would always know the truth.

I suspect it is the same for people who do believe in God, you cannot merely ""choose"" to stop believing in God, that's not possible.

These beliefs, like all beliefs, are not mere ""choices"", and to portray them this way, as many people do over and over again on these debate forums, is damaging to intellectual conversation. We must recognize the truth, that our beliefs, our opinions, and our ideas are causally determined by our experiences, and that it would require NEW experiences, NEW information to change them.

It is not a mere ""choice""... nothing is.

So, the question then is how does one end up going from a Christian to an atheist, or from an atheist to a Christian, or from a Christian to a Muslim, or from a Muslim to a Jew?

The answer is competing influence due to new knowledge gained from knew experiences. This is obvious, and I'll explain why:

As a child I might not have believed that I could dip my wet hand in molten lead and not get burned, but now that I understand the physics behind that reaction I can believe it without ever actually experiencing it myself.... new knowledge leads to new beliefs and knew understandings. If there was ever a more obvious statement I haven't heard it, it's the entire reason we go to school, it's the entire reason we practice things we want to be good at, everyone knows this and everyone agrees with it... so why don't we understand that when it comes to certain types of beliefs?

Now, getting away from my original point slightly, it is also obviously true that had we been born into a jungle tribe in Africa rather than in America we would have had a completely different set of experiences than most of us have had, and those different experiences would have lead to different knowledge and thus different beliefs. It is also patently obvious that none of us choose where or when we are born, or what parents we have, or what relatives we have... the many obvious conclusions of this include that we also do not control where we go to school, what teachers we have, what classmates we have, who our friends end up being, etc etc... in fact, we don't control ANYTHING. Every single aspect of your life utterly DEPENDED on the circumstances that you were born into. For example, whether or not you ""choose"" to go to college and where you ""choose"" to apply has a set of REASONS, and those reasons are the beliefs and knowledge that you have when you make those choices, and the beliefs and knowledge that you have are a result of your past experiences, and your past experiences are the result of the circumstances you were born into (if you were born into an African jungle tribe do you think you would have went to the same university?)...

All of this is obvious... so why do people believe in free will? Because it really feels like they could suddenly stop believing in God **if they wanted to**?

This seems to me to be the entire crux of the debate. I used to be a Christian, and remember how it feels, and can currently only assume that the reason (in absence of a rational one, which I hope that somebody can provide) is simply that you were told these things when young, and are not able to evaluate them fairly with balance. i.e. I assume that your brain seemingly won't let you look at the truth, and you dance around the seemingly obvious, which is that reports of magic are not at all reliable, especially from ancient and uneducated times. If they even happened, Occam's razor would seemingly suggest magic tricks before huge implications about the entire universe.

The logic debate involving Aquinas' work to make the story internally consistent seems utterly worthless - a rabid Star Trek fan might do the same with their fiction, one could simply assert that *Atlantis* was and thus the story is now logically consistent - but an internally consistent story does not mean that the story is true, rather the entire value of the story rests upon the assumption of the unusual honesty of the witnesses from who you get the story. (A story which just happens to be the one which you were told as a child - i.e. I am accusing you of having an excruciatingly-unfounded bias with these witnesses). 

Maybe that previously-mentioned internal logic (people like Aquinas are just digging the story-hole when the lie is revealed to be untrue as I see it) can explain why the supposed creator of the universe sent an offspring to only tell one group of people in a manner indistinguishable from other claims, and not, say, have somebody walking on water and being the son of the creator of the entire universe and all the galaxies and dust within being sent to Vietnam thousands of years ago (because, on a sarcastic-aside, that slightly-unfamiliar version would be an outrageously-tall claim - I suspect that all of a sudden you'd want to see significant evidence), but, any internally-consistent answers such as ""The Devil made people make other claims so that the Christian ones would look foolish in company"" is just magical circle-reasoning.

Have you ever said this to a non-believer?
Have they ever expressed a lack of appreciation for this sentiment?
Do you wonder why?

Atheists:
Has a theist ever said this to you?
Does it bother you?
Have you ever wondered why they say this?

I'm a former Christian, with family and friends who are still very devout Christians. I hear this phrase very often. I also have atheist friends who find the phrase very insulting to them. I'd like to offer my perspective and to hear the perspectives of others.

This phrase is uttered in many contexts, so in this instance I'll clarify that I'm referring to its usage with regard to a Christian telling an Atheist that they'll pray for them, usually at the end of a somewhat contentious conversation about Christianity or Religion. This is the context that I feel most atheists are offended by.

Christians, I shall now assume the role of the Atheist you just said this to.

I can understand why you would say this. Simply by saying it, I know that you, at least on some level, care about me. You care that I am on the wrong path, that I am lost. You wish to guide me onto the right path (we wouldn't have been having this conversation otherwise). For whatever reason, you were unsuccessful in convincing me over the course of this one conversation. An unrealistic expectation, but nevertheless, you are disappointed. You don't want it to be a total loss, however, and there's one last thing you can do for me. You can pray that God will show me the way; that with his help, I will be saved. This is a wonderful, selfless gesture that you're sure I will appreciate, and you want to end the conversation on good terms, so you say ""I'll pray for you"".

I hope I've adequately demonstrated my understanding of the phrase. Please tell me in the comments if I'm way off. But assuming we're still on the same page, here's my reply.

While you do not share my views, you're at least intelligent enough to entertain them. You know that, from my perspective, prayer does nothing, literally nothing. Just words. I mean no disrespect, but you know that I consider your prayers to be as useful as wishing on a star. Secondly, You could have prayed for me without telling me and it wouldn't have made a difference, unless you believe that prayer's effect is influenced by whether or not its subject is cognisant of its invocation (I've never met anyone who believes this). Knowing these two things, why did you tell me? Who was the phrase actually meant for? Not for me, since you know I don't believe in prayer's effect. It was for yourself. You want me to acknowledge that you're doing this kind, selfless gesture for me. By telling me that you'll pray for me, you've turned a selfless gesture into a selfish one.

Additionally, By invoking prayer at the end of the conversation, you are demonstrating that you have no intention of seriously considering any points that were made, whether they were valid or not - instead, simplifying the conversation down to a failure on my (and/or your) part, that requires prayer to resolve. This is naturally very frustrating, especially if I have invested a lot of thought into the conversation.

So Christians, please think twice before deciding to tell a non-believer that you'll pray for them. And Atheists, remember that it's coming from a good place, and try to treat it as such.

How can I, in all good conscience, hold that almost 90% of the people I know and cherish will go to hell for failing to believe in a dubious 2000 year-old tale? How can I fault the intelligent atheist for not believing in this credulous story which at best has circumstantial evidence and at worst is self-contradictory nonsense?

Inevitably there was no emotional connection between us because they would not accept anything other than a profession of Christian belief. They would settle for nothing less than a Christian robot for a son. As you can tell it still bothers me and I am here to wrestle with that demon and deconstruct the sickness that is or was (my father died earlier this year) my parent's Christianity. 

I have recently come to understand that the fault is not Christianity exactly. The fault is who we are. I mean no matter where my parents were raised or what label they put on themselves (Christian, Buddhist, Atheist, alcoholic, etc.) they would have found a way to avoid truly engaging life and accepting themselves and others for who they truly are. 

But, all that being said, they really were Christians and, from my perspective, Christianity for them and for me was not a solution to anything. It was an enabler and a big part of the problem. 

So there it is. What is touted by millions as the greatest thing in the world, was and is, for me, one of the worst things in the world. 

There is no magic bullet. No belief system or ideology is going to make us the people we should be. The Kingdom of the Spirit is not about conformity or labels. The Kingdom is *within*. It is *not* a system. It is a wordless *non-system*. It is feeling. It is Spirit. And this Spirit is not to be found written with ink on the pages of the Bible. This knowledge is written, *not* on tablets of stone (or pages of paper), but within each one of us, on the tablet of the human heart. 

God's kingdom is *not* of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. So stop defending a book or an ideology. It makes me sick.",,False,,t5_2ryd5,True,,violet brackets,True,t3_e4n15,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/e4n15/why_i_post/,

When someone rejects an idea or claim as being necessarily true, they do not have to prove that the inverse is true, the burden of proof is not upon them, because they are not claiming the inverse is true by that rejection alone. They are not making a separate claim. Neither do they have to prove that the claim actually being made is necessarily false. Their only stance is that the claim is not *necessarily* true, that there is enough margin for the claim to be false, and therefore shouldn't be deemed absolute truth.

If someone, for instance, were to tell me that rocks can talk, I do not have to conclusively prove that no rock has ever uttered any hint of language over the history of time. Rather, by saying that no, rocks do not talk, I point to the fact that rocks have never been observed talking, they lack the identifiable structure and capacity to talk, and so it is safe to say that rocks do not talk. 

When a rejection of the claim ""God exists"" occurs, it is not necessarily assuming the inverse, that no gods necessarily exist. It is simply measuring the evidence we have for any particular deities and observing that it is not ample enough to justify that statement.

* If Jesus was really found guilty of blasphemy by the Sanhedrin, why was he not simply stoned to death, as Jewish law required (Mishnah Sanhedrin 6:4 h &amp; i)? Why is the original trial account of Jesus so full of other unhistorical details and just plain mistakes that could never have actually happen as portrayed? How can each successive gospel continue to overload the original story with their own additional layers of details that are mutually incompatible with the others?

* Why does Seneca the Younger record all kinds of unusual natural phenomena in the seven books of his Quaestiones Naturales, including eclipses and earthquakes, but not mention the Star of Bethlehem, the pair of Judean earthquakes that were strong enough to split stones, or the hours of supernatural darkness that covered “all the land” – an event he would have witnessed firsthand?

* Why can’t the Gospels agree on so many fundamental facts about Jesus’ life and ministry, such as what his relationship to John the Baptist was – and why was John the Baptist’s cult a rival to Christianity until at least the early second century?

* Who were Jesus’ disciples, and why is it no Gospels agree on who they were? Why do the disciples disappear so quickly in the New Testament after the Gospels, only to pop up again centuries later when churches start spinning rival legends that they were busy founding Christian communities all along? If any were martyred for their faith, as Christians frequently insist, why don’t we have any details of any of the disciples’s deaths in the bible?

* When his skeptical Roman opponent Celsus asks the early church father Origen what miracles Jesus performed, why can Origen only respond lamely that Jesus’ life was indeed full of striking and miraculous events, “but from what other source can we can furnish an answer than from the Gospel narratives?” (Contra Celsum, 2.33)

* Why can’t the Gospels agree on so many fundamental facts about Jesus’ life and ministry?  For instance, if he was born during the reign of Herod the Great, or over a decade later, during Quirinius’ tenure? Or why he was arrested? Or on which day he died? Or whether he appeared alive again for just a single day, or for more about a week, or for forty days? Or where and when he appeared alive again, and to whom?

* Why are there so many anachronisms and basic mistakes and misunderstandings about first century Judean Judaism? Why are the Gospels all written in Greek, not Aramaic? Why do Christians insist that they are eyewitness accounts when none claim to be, or even read as if they were, or if all contain indications that they were written generations later?

* Why is Paul – and every other Christian writer from the first generation of Christianity – so silent on any details of Jesus’ life? Why do they display so much ignorance of Jesus’ teachings and miracles?

* Despite the frequent boasts in the New Testament of Christianity spreading like wildfire, attracting new converts by the thousands with every new miracle or inspired sermon, why does Christianity remain a struggling, obscure cult of feuding house churches on the fringe of Roman society for more than three centuries?

* Why is there not a single historical reference to Jesus in the entire first century; a pair of obviously interpolated snippets in the works of Flavius Josephus notwithstanding?

We have no choice but to sin at some point in our lives and throughout our lives. Since none of us, not even Christians, can choose to be non-sinners, the ultimate, the only truly meaningful, sin is to fail to choose Jesus as Lord and Savior.

Can you choose to believe in Santa Claus? Bigfoot? Chupacabras? The Loch Ness Monster? You have reasonably concluded that all of these things are myths. There was no choice. You cannot escape what you believe to be the truth about these matters. Based on the evidence or lack of evidence you had *no choice* but to conclude that all of these things were myths.

In the matter of Jesus, there is also no choice. You cannot escape what you believe to be the truth about Jesus. Based on the evidence or lack of evidence each of us has had *no choice* but to reach our own personal conclusion on the matter of Jesus' deity and the resurrection.

Christians: You didn't *choose* to believe Jesus is the son of God who died for your sins and rose again. Based upon your assessment of the evidence *you had no choice* but to conclude that Christianity is the true religion. To deny what you perceive to be reality and truth would be dishonest, delusional.

Non-Christians: You didn't *choose* to believe Jesus was just a man. Based upon your assessment of the evidence *you had no choice* but to conclude that Christianity is a false religion. To deny what you perceive to be reality and truth would be dishonest, delusional.

Free will has nothing to do with this. Is there any person in their right mind who would conclude that Jesus is God and then reject him? Of course not. Is their any person in their right mind who would conclude that Jesus was just a man and then worship him as God? Of course not. No one *chooses* Jesus. We each have *no choice* but to arrive at whatever conclusions we have reached about Jesus.

We can choose to try and follow the moral teachings of Jesus. I do this. But I cannot deny what I see as reality: Jesus was just a man.

2) Paul was previously known as Saul and made a living of persecuting Christians around Jerusalem.  
3) While journeying to Damascus, Saul was struck by a bright light, saw a vision of Jesus and fell blind for three days. Saul subsequently converted and became known as Paul.  
4) Paul mentions nothing of Christ apart from his crucifixion.


~~5) Paul writes that Jesus is not descended from David, in direct contradiction with the gospels. ~~   
6) Paul preaches dogma that Christ never mentioned, including inequality of women, condemnation of homosexuality, prayer, judging others, baptism, cleanliness of foods, remission of sins, etc.

The more I read the ""proofs"" of these prophecies (both from people commenting on here and other websites), the more I realize that merely believing in prophecies is an act of faith in itself.  Asking a believer to justify or proove a prophecy to a non-believer will most likely end up in frustration on both sides.

Believers obviously see MANY prophecies as being fulfilled, because the bible says so and it is an accurate historical record due to its many incarnations and translations, and its massive popularity.  Non-believers will see NO prophecies as being fulfilled for the opposite reasons.

At the very least, I now understand the gap between believers and non-believers a little more clearly after this topic.  I thank everyone for contributing, and hope that this conversation can continue.



INTRODUCTION: I've read and heard a lot about how there are so many biblical prophecies that have come true, and this is cited regularly as proof of the divine nature of the bible.

I just don't see it.  I have yet to see anything prophecied in the Bible that is not circular logic and it simply fulfils its own earlier predictions.

I would like a Christian to enlighten me and provide an example of a biblical prophecy that has come true in the time since the bible was written (circa 100 AD).  Any prophecies cited should be accompanied by an explanation of how that prophecy was divinely inspired and not simply an educated guess of man.  For example, ""there will be conflict in the land of the Israelites"" was obvious to any human being living in the 2nd century.

In debate style, I propose that there are no prophecies in the Christian bible that suggest divine inspiration.

Please rebut.

EDIT: 

I would like to be clear of the criteria that I would accept as being ""valid prophecy"" at which time I would agree that my proposal/hypothesis would be invalidated and I would agree that the bible contains at least one valid prophecy:

- (a) The prophecy describes an event that is clear and not simply a vague guess that someone living 2000 years ago could have easily predicted (e.g. ""There will be a war"", ""There will be a corrupt King"", and ""A city will be destroyed and rebuilt"" are all very common events and are hardly prophecies)

- (b) Metaphorical prophecies by their very nature are so vague as to be immediately rejected for the above reason.

- (c) There must have been some precognition involved in the prophecy such that a supreme being would have provided knowledge or insight.  Details should have been provided that could not possibly have been known beforehand.

- (d) The date of writing predates the event, according to the generally accepted view from historians.

- (e) The events actually happened in their entirety, you can't just pick PARTS of the prophecy that came true

- (f) Although I'm willing to relax this one a little, I'd like to see prophecies of events dated after 0 AD.

SCORECARD:

- Isiah 44:28 (Jerusalem will be rebuilt) - Fails (a)
- Isiah 44-45 (Cyrus' Conquests) - Fails (a)
- Daniel 8 (Alexander the Great) - Fails (d)
- Daniel 9 (predicting the birth date of Jesus) - Investigating, but looks like it fails (b) and (e)

I hope it should be clear to believers and non-believers alike that there's a vast difference between saying ""Well, I believe X because I've had experiences that have convinced me that that's the way I want to live and act, but ultimately it's up for each person to really think and explore things like this deeply and decide for themselves once they understand enough about X and its alternatives"" and ""I know X is true and that not believing X will have serious negative consequences for you (and -- implied -- for our relationship / my respect and/or love for you)""

I fully realize how real and incredibly important people's faith is to them, and I think it's fine to let your children know that it's central to your life -- doing otherwise would be disingenuous (as an atheist I feel I have this much easier, as there's no fear that my children will choose spiritual beliefs that would ever make me feel estranged from or disappointed in them, so long as they made that choice of their own free, rational decision).

And of course everyone has the duty to instill moral and ethical behavior in their children. I feel that having studied a number of religions as well as history, science, psychology, and philosophy that I have a very deep understanding of ethics, for what it's worth (I include this only because there are those who think that atheists are necessarily devoid of morals or ethics).

Consider for a moment the pre-Civil War white child on a plantation in the South. Would the parent of this child not believe that it was right to teach their children that whites were meant to own blacks, that blacks were an inferior race, and would not an abolitionist in the North (or almost all of us these days) not hold that indoctrinating a child with this attitude would be hurtful and prejudicial to their ability to view and treat other races equitably as an adult?

No, I am not equating Christianity with racism, however the operation of transfering a core belief about him or herself and about other people, their value(s), etc. is identical. I would close with this additional question: do those of you are Christian not think -- in your hearts -- that it is damaging to the children of fundamentalism Muslims to bring them up bowing toward Mecca and believing that 72 virgins await them in heaven if they are killed in a jihad? If you do believe this, please consider that they feel the same way about what you're raising your kids to believe -- this should then tell why atheists feel as they do about all religious indoctrination of children.

I have looked up commentary after commentary and have not found anyone willing to call this out for being completely immoral.

1301245759.0,23,self.DebateAChristian,gckgc,The gospel according to Paul only,Basilides,32,9,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/gckgc/the_gospel_according_to_paul_only/,"If you analyze Paul's writings in isolation, you will see that, while Paul heard *a* story of *a* Jesus, it is only a rough outline: 

1) At an unspecified time or place, ""born of woman"" (not a young woman or a virgin). 

Whenever Paul refers to someones birth (Rom. 9:11,Gal. 4:23 and 4:29) he always uses gennano. But when he refers to Christ's birth a few verses earlier in Galatians he changes to ginomai. (And in Romans 1:3)
 
It seems a stretch to think that it's merely chance that Paul uses a different word for ""born"" only when referring to Jesus.

Therefore, the type of ""woman"" Paul is thinking of here could be akin to the woman with child chased by the dragon in the Book of Revelation. After, all Jesus is the lamb slain from the foundation of the world (in some mythic dimension). And Paul described Jesus as a ""heavenly man"" ""from heaven"". Would he not therefore have a ""heavenly mother""?

2)  in Paul's writings, all of the evidence for the good news of the gospel is revealed by OT scripture or by the Spirit. Nothing has been revealed by the recently completed life of Jesus of Nazareth.

3) Betrayed by a party/parties unknown

4) At an unspecified time or place, crucified, died, buried and rose again on the third day. Again, Paul's lamb could have been slain, literally, from the foundation of the world.

5) If Paul's Jesus really was killed in 1st century Judea...he should not have said that the government that killed Jesus was justified in doing so.

For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 4 For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. (Romans 13)

From reading the above you'd almost think that Paul's Jesus was not killed by the Roman government.

6) Post-resurrection, Paul's Jesus ""appeared"" before various people including Paul. The only ""appearance"" Paul describes is that of a talking light on the road to Damascus. Paul makes no differentiation between the nature of the appearance before himself and the appearances before others. (1 Corinthians 15:5-7) Reading Paul's writings in isolation, the implication is that all of the appearances were visions.

7) Paul's Jesus did not receive his name while in his mother's womb. Paul's Jesus received the name ""Jesus"" as a result of being crucified. (Philippians 2:9-10)

8) For Paul, the ascension consisted of Jesus descending into hell so as to rise up to heaven. No mention is made of ascending from earth to heaven. Paul's Jesus does not pass go at earth and collect 200 hundred dollars on his way to heaven. (Ephesians 4:8-10)

9) Paul's Jesus only appeared in the likeness of flesh (Philippians 2:7, Romans 8:3). 

To argue that Jesus can appear in the ""likeness of flesh"" and actually *be in the flesh* is to completely disregard the meaning of the phrase ""likeness of flesh"".

""When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God."" (Genesis 5:1)

Was man God because he was in the ""likeness of God""? Of course not. Similarly, Paul's Jesus is not flesh because he is, instead, in the ""likeness of flesh"".

Paul's Jesus was not God in the flesh. 

As further evidence of this consider that the Jews did not accuse Paul of referring to a recently deceased man as the incarnation of God on earth. Also consider that while Paul referred to Jesus as a ""man"" (Romans 5:17), unlike Paul's first man, Adam, Paul's second man, Jesus, is of heaven, not of the earth.

Philo:

""There are two kinds of men. The one is Heavenly Man, the other earthly. **The Heavenly Man being in the image of God has no part in corruptible substance, or in any earthly substance whatever**; but the earthly man was made of germinal matter which the writer [of Genesis] calls ""dust."" For this reason he does not say that the Heavenly Man was created, but that he was stamped with the image of God, whereas the earthly man is a creature and not the offspring of the Creator."" (From Allegorical Interpretation of the Law)
 
""...flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption."" (1 Corinthians 15:50)

""For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality."" (1 Corinthians 15:53)

What is corruptible is flesh and blood. What is incorruptible is something other than flesh and blood.

Paul's Jesus was not corruptible. Paul's Jesus was not flesh and blood.

12) Paul credits his Jesus with only three teachings, communion, divorce and paying the clergy. Paul misses many opportunities to refer to the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.

13) Aside from the above, here is what is missing from Paul's epistles:

- Bethlehem (Jesus' birthplace)
- a place called 'Nazareth' (as in ""Jesus of Nazareth"")
- a Roman census 
- parents named Mary and Joseph
- angelic visitations to both Mary and Joseph
- the Virgin Birth 
- the Slaughter of the Innocents
- the Magi (they were magically summoned to meet the baby Jesus)
- John the Baptist 
- Jesus' baptism
- Jesus' career as a carpenter 
- Galilee 
- Jesus' itinerant preaching ministry in Judea (didn't Paul the apostle know about this?!)
- Disciples (Paul, who boasted that he himself received his gospel from no man, never acknowledges that a band of merry men accompanied Jesus during his earthly ministry)
- that Jesus was a teacher of morals 
- that Jesus taught in parables
- The Sermon on the Mount
- Jesus' prayers
- Jesus' many miracles (Paul nowhere has his Jesus turn water into wine, stilling storms, feeding 5,000 or walking on lakes)
- Jesus' healings and cures (no mention of the blind receiving their sight, for example, after Jesus spits into dysfunctional eyes)
- Jesus' exorcisms
- Jesus' temptation in the wilderness
- Mary Magdalene
- Nicodemus (mentioned only in the gospel of John)
- Judas Iscariot (a key player in the lead-up to the passion story)
- Gethsemane (and Jesus' hesitation there)
- a trial before Pilate
- Peter's repeated denials (wouldn't Galatians 2 have been a perfect opportunity for Paul to throw this in Peter's face?)
- Jesus' flogging 
- Jesus' crucifixion outside the walls of Jerusalem 
- a place called ""Calvary"" (mentioned only in Luke 23:33)
- the two malefactors condemned with Jesus
- Jesus' words from the cross
- the spear thrust in Jesus' side
- the darkness over the earth
- the earthquake
- the rising of the saints mentioned only in Matthew 27:52-53 
- Joseph of Arimathaea
- Golgotha
- female witnesses
- an empty tomb 
- Doubting Thomas
- The Great Commission. Regarding Jesus' choice of disciples Paul says, ""As for those who were held in high esteem—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism—they added nothing to my message."" (Galatians 2:6) Contrast that with what Jesus himself said about these men: Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."" (Matthew 19:28)
- The Ascension

Now the explanation I usually get for this is that congregations in the far flung towns of Corinth and Rome etc. already knew the gospel story and all of Jesus' teachings chapter and verse and had no need to have any of it repeated back to them. But if this is true then we must believe that these congregants knew everything about Jesus and what would become the NT but little to nothing about the OT because, in his epistles, Paul is constantly referring to OT teachings and stories.

I think the explanation for all of this is that, during the life of Paul, the Christology of a cosmic Christ who was slain, not in Jerusalem but, from the foundation of the world was already well-developed. But the story of one Jesus of Nazareth had yet to be created. 

Paul himself said that he received his gospel ""from no man"" (Galatians 1:11-12). Yet there were supposedly gospel stories floating around which, surely, Paul would have heard in his contact with other Christians. 

Did Paul willfully ignore the sacred stories and teachings that eventually found their way into the four gospels? Or did the sacred stories and teachings found in the four gospels not yet exist *in any form*, written or oral, while Paul was still preaching? 

Conclusion: Paul's Jesus was not Jesus of Nazareth.

The reason for this seems to be that the church destroyed the original documents as soon as it had the power to do so; they didn't want people to know that the Romans had a long tradition of pointing out that their religion made no sense.  We know about these critics only because their writing survives in the rebuttals written by early Christian apologists.  

The most notable of these critics is probably Celsus, whose work *The True Word* survives in Origen's *Against Celsus*.  He is noteworthy for several reasons; his writing is the earliest criticism we know of in any detail, although we know he was only the latest in a long tradition, his work is preserved with some accuracy as Origen's rebuttal depended on not attacking a straw man, and he drew on an apparently deep knowledge of the Old and New Testaments and personal experiences rather than the hearsay of some other Christian detractors of the time.  The Wikipedia article on [The True Word](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_True_Word) goes into pretty good detail, and his arguments sound shockingly familiar:

&gt;In his opinion Christian theology was based on an amalgamation of false eastern philosophical ideas hastily tied together. He stated that Christians would “weave together erroneous opinions drawn from ancient sources and trumpet them aloud”.  Celsus gave a point by point critique of Christian doctrine, and why it should not have been believed by anyone. He stated that the “virgin” birth story was ridiculous, and that Mary was an adulteress turned out by her husband. His theory was not new, as even Jews at that time were saying the same. The remainder of Christian stories – what now makes up the Christian Bible- Celsus found very insipid and unappealing compared to Greek and Roman legends of powerful and colorful gods. Celsus also found Christian philosophy lacking when compared to secular philosophy, and declared that “things are stated much better among the Greeks”.

&gt;...

&gt;Celsus could deduce no explanation for the actions of the Christian God, such as the floods, natural disasters, and the introduction of evil into the world, except that God wanted to draw attention to his greatness because he felt humanity was giving him “less than his due”.  Celsus concluded that Christians used the explanation of God ""testing"" them to disguise the fact that their God was not powerful enough to successfully fight Satan, but was instead “helpless”.  Celsus wrote that Satan was either a mortal invention used by Christians to frighten others into believing their philosophies and joining them, or if he did indeed exist then he was proof that God was not all-powerful, but rather a weak lesser god and a bad one, for only a vindictive and insecure being would punish mankind for being tricked by an evil that he has been too weak to stop.  The apparent “blind faith” of the Christians was bewildering to Celsus, and he used it to further support his claim that Christianity was a false religion. In his opinion, **the main tenet of Christianity was “Do not ask questions, just believe” and “Thy faith will save thee""**.

&gt;...

&gt;Celsus’ main argument against Christianity, and why he attacked it with such vigor, was that he considered it a divisive and destructive force that would harm both the Roman Empire and society...Christianity originated from Judaism, whose adherents, although living within the Empire, had already revolted against Roman rule several times. The Christian community then became further divided amongst themselves, and Celsus complained that “matters are determined in different ways by the various sects”.  This dissension between different factions within Christianity proved to the Romans that Christians who could not even draw together under their own shared beliefs were naturally a divisive people and not only caused friction within their own philosophy but would disrupt the unity of the Empire. Finally Celsus and other Roman writers believed that “Christians are dangerous precisely because they put the advancement of their beliefs above the common good and the welfare of the state”.

Inconsistent origin story, obvious plagiarism from earlier mythology, a god whose actions don't make sense, using the threat of Satan/hell to scare converts into believing, the stupidity of blind faith, the danger that it poses to society, fear that Christians will put their beliefs over what is beneficial to the state, etc.  Today's atheists and anti-theists are making the **exact same arguments**, and Celsus wrote in about 177.  I've made many of the same arguments myself, so clearly Christianity hasn't really responded to the early criticisms with any lasting force.  Well, other than killing their critics.

Does your faith in Jesus Christ and all of his works and your faith in everlasting life live or die on whether or not a butterfly can become a slightly different butterfly?""

The low-hanging fruit logical answer is that if someone IS a biblical literalist, then if any section of the text whatsoever is falsifiable, then the rest of the faith comes into question, so one must fight to preserve the literal truth of every section.

And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.""  My bible explains that the etymology of this passage references an ancient world belief that the sky was a large dome made of solid rock (firmament) splitting the vast infinite waters into a small 'air pocket' where people could live.  An aspect of this belief was that the area outside the dome contained heaven and the spirit world, and stars were holes in the dome where heaven shown in on earth.

If you cared to answer the first question I have a followup.

If I were to tell you that last night God himself came to me in my room and asked me to be the anti christ/the chosen one, would you believe me?

How would my first hand testimonial be any different from the accounts in the bible that were written by third party authors, well after the so called experience?

I dont care to debate the intricacies like,  ""god never visited a human in a humanoid form"" or ""the stories in the bible are fact"".

1311879291.0,21,self.DebateAChristian,j2fly,This issue needs to be addressed in this subreddit...,YouDontEvenKnow2,33,12,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/j2fly/this_issue_needs_to_be_addressed_in_this_subreddit/,"Posting from my throwaway in order to address some concerns. 

Over in r/Christianity we get a lot of complaints about this subreddit. Most people go to r/Christianity and ask debate questions or at least make comments to start a debate and when we refer them here, we often get comments like, “Well r/debateachristian is a ghost town. No one goes there.” And I find this partly true and not true at the same time for several reasons that everyone needs to be aware of from a Christian perspective. 

First of all, you need to know why more Christians don’t come here. They don’t come here because this community doesn’t welcome them. It is more like questions are bait looking to lure unsuspecting Christians in, in order to pounce on them at the first opportunity. I have seen a great lack of respect for Christians. Now if you believe that Christians don’t deserve your respect, that is one thing, but to show disrespect and still expect them to visit this subreddit is ridiculous. 

Another reason, whether we like it or not, is that karma does count. It may not mean anything but we do all like to see great comments get upvoted. While not all the time, a typical thing I have seen in this subreddit is that Christian answers often receive downvotes because you disagree with them even if they have taken a lot of time and put thought into their answers. Of course you are going to disagree with them, but it can just be disappointing to spend ½ hour constructing a comment with links and quotes only to finish a few votes in the negative. If someone makes an attempt to give a thought out answer, they deserve an upvote. Likewise, it just seems like an atheist discussion when we view an answer and an atheist response agreeing with the OP is voted to the top. It doesn’t seem like you really want a debate when you upvote those comments, just wanting an added assurance that your objection is valid and disproves Christianity without any debate. 

Lastly on this, it seems like a lot of the OP’s aren’t really looking for a debate, they are just looking for an opportunity to attack Christianity. “Are you so stupid that you actually believe this is true” types of post don’t really seem like they are trying to start an intellectual debate and I avoid posting in those types of posts because it seems like the dialogue quickly boils down to a personal attack or at least and ending comment such as, “Well Christians have done bad things in history and therefore you are a terrible person so I am right and you are wrong” which never addresses the question at hand. 

Lastly, I have rarely seen a post not receive a Christian comment. Lots of times, the reason you are not receiving a lot of Christian comments is that Christians see your questions, move to the comments, sees another Christian give an intelligent answer that they agree with and have nothing more to add to, and they move on. Just work with the Christian answers you get because they will a lot of the times represent the majority of Christian comments you would receive. 

Keeping these things in mind when you write will make this community more active and allow more Christians to come here to comment.

It seems to me that the only evidence for Christianity is The Bible. It's generally accepted by Christians that the Bible is the word of God and is proof of God's and Jesus' existence.

I don't think there's any tangible evidence for Christianity other than The Bible (unless you believe in ID, which would only be evidence for a creator, rather than direct evidence for Yahweh/Jesus).

With that said, why do you believe that The Bible is correct, but The Koran, the Mayan creation story, Joseph Smith's Mormon tablets, the Hindu creation story, etc. are not?

On a scale of 0-10, where 0 represented absolute disbelief in Yahweh, and 10 represented absolute belief, I'd say I'm at a 1.5 right now. In addition to wrestling with things like Russel's Teapot, how the Bible is even remotely compatible with evolution, and the authenticity of the Bible, the character of God is what has been tripping me up recently. I stumbled across a video in which the God of the Old Testament is compared to the God of the New Testament, and how it's darn near impossible to equate the two.

Here's the video in question: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqfGu6vTxFY&amp;feature=channel

If you could help answer the questions posed in that video, or at least help diminish the significant claims that NonStampCollector is making, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Edit: I should also note, one of the justifications I've been given over the course of my church history is that because God's knowledge and wisdom is so much greater than ours, we need to take it on faith that the atrocities committed in the Old Testament were the actions of a just God, and we just can't see the justification in that with our feeble minds. This argument is largely unsatisfying to me however, because I feel like it selectively allows us to substitute reason for faith when it best suits us. We dismiss the claims of other religions, because we find that their accounts of creation are too ludicrous, or that their gods have bizarre traits, etc., using our rationale and intellect. However, when it comes to the claims of the Bible, we tend to take our thinking cap off and instead accept 'truth' by faith. It's my ever-growing position that if something does appear to be a logical fallacy in the Bible, it probably is.


Likewise, I feel the same about discerning between literal/analogous interpretations of the Bible. If we can assert that part of what we believe to be recorded history ""is simply an analogy/metaphor for spiritual issues"", then that only brings about the questioning of *everything* as to whether it's an actual account or a metaphorical one. You can't say ""Everything in this book is true (except for the parts that were actually fictitious stories used to convey a point)"", because if the Bible isn't literal, than anyone can twist its words for their own justification.",,False,,t5_2ryd5,True,,,True,t3_f1qgi,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/f1qgi/a_square_is_a_square_a_circle_is_a_square/,

Here's the list:

&gt;1. Find what the article is about. Find the major subject matter. Define the problem(s) the blogger is trying to solve or setting and try to correctly outline the whole article.

&gt;2. Come to terms with the blogger by interpreting his key words, grasping leading propositions in his most important sentences.

&gt;3. Know the blogger’s arguments by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences.

&gt;4. Do not begin criticism until you have completed reading and rereading the article, correctly interpreting the blogger’s words, understood and outline his argument. “Do not say you agree, disagree, or suspend judgment, until you can say “I understand.”- Mortimer J. Adler

&gt;5. Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously.

&gt;6. Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgment you make.

&gt;7. When criticizing, try to use as few, clear and kind words to show wherein the blogger is uninformed, misinformed, illogical or incomplete.

&gt;8. Avoid disagreeing on minor details.

&gt;9. “Pick your battles”. Do not comment on the topic you are not familiar with. Study, ponder, and come back when you are familiar with the topic at hand.

&gt;10. Be quick to point out your own errors. Quick to admit you were wrong, and quick to correct your mistakes.

These tips can easily apply to atheists just as much to Christians.

The Church fathers, by and large, said that hell was a place of literal burning flames. Many of today's Christians, however, think these Church fathers who were oh so right about canonization were mistaken about the fundamental doctrine of hell and insist that ""hell"", instead of bring a real place of burning flames, is just a metaphor for the perfectly undefinable state known as ""separation from God"".

It is standard Christian belief that the Church fathers were divinely inspired to select for the canon of scripture precisely the documents that were the ""word of God"". *On the subject of canonization*, Protestants in particular perceive the Catholic Church fathers as being essentially infallible. Protestants do this because in order for that Catholic-selected anthology of writings to be the Protestant's infallible Pope it had to be put together by infallible people. But, as we know, on issues other than the selection of the canon, Protestants are convinced that the Church fathers had no idea of what they were talking about. Or worse. This is cherry picking.

The stories are so interesting and because it changed as the civilizations conquered new territories, and often because it varied from territory to territory, the tales you get from such variables tend to be some of the most vivid story-telling possible. While studying the concept of the Greek Underworld, the similarities between the Christian afterlife and the Greek version are numerous.

This is all based on recollection (and to prevent the need of an essay, is oversimplified) so please correct any inaccuracies. 

The Greeks believed in an Underworld mainly consisting of three areas, Elysium, where you dined with the heroes and Gods (I believe Cronus is thought to be in Elysium, yes?) of the world, described basically as being our concept of Heaven. Tartarus, a pit of eternal flame where the damned are tortured for all eternity. The Asphodel Plains, where those who were neither good nor bad would rest for eternity. 

Christians believe, generally (so many denominations I'm sure there are some who don't), in Heaven, a place where you live with the best of the world and are in the presence of God. Also, Hell, a place of eternal fire where sinners suffer for all eternity. Limbo of the fathers/infants being where those who die with original sin but not assigned to hell sit in nothingness forever. 

This is far from the only example of Christian traditions/beliefs being torn bloodily from the religions of past civilizations. **My question for the faithful is then, why do you believe these incredible similarities exist?**

My belief is that members of the Christian faith employ the same tactics as the Greeks used to convert societies over to their worldview, incorporating their existing beliefs directly into their belief system allowing the transition to be as painless as possible.

Note: I'm only talking about factual claims here; not your ""personal relationship"" nonsense.

* Christians say the bible is true and all the other religions are wrong (based on faith).
* Muslims say the quran is true and all other religions are wrong (also based on faith).
* ...

All religions give the same justification (faith) for their beliefs, but only 1 religion can be correct. I conclude that **faith is not a valid way of knowing which of the claims are actually true**, since it works for any of the religions. (Please post if you think otherwise)


Question: What (objective) method can we use to determine which religion is true? (aka: How can you tell that christianity is true and not islam?)

My response: There's no way to tell which religion is true.
(Again, if you disagree, please post)

This causes a problem:
Now, if we assume god is all-loving, we'd expect him to want us to be happy. Therefore he doesn't want us to go to hell (because that would make us unhappy). Choosing the wrong religion causes us to go to hell, so if god is all-loving, he would want us to choose the right religion. Then why is there no way of knowing which of the many this religions is the right one? Surely an all-knowing being would be able to forsee that some people would make up fake religions. Then why didn't he provide a way to differentiate between the fake religions and the real one?

If there was an all-loving god, I'd expect there to be only 1 religion or at least some way of telling the real one from the fake ones.

---------------------------------------------------------
TL;DR: There are lots of religions and you can't objectively tell which is the real one, so there can't be a caring, all-loving god that sends you to hell if you choose wrong.

The evangelist Mark uses the *Septuagint* in quoting Jesus as saying, ""teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.""  However, the Hebrew original has it as, ""their fear of me is a commandment of men learned by rote."" (Isaiah 29:13, RSV), which actually defeats his original point.  If these are actual quotes, Jesus and the Pharisees would obviously be quoting the Hebrew Tanakh, yet here the Lord and Savior uses the Greek text.

Obviously the author of Mark views the Septuagint as ""the Bible"" and uses it as such, though the characters in his story would not have done so.  There are countless other examples of Mark quoting the Septuagint as the words of Jesus rather than the Tanakh.  The evangelist is clearly either a gentile or a fully-Hellenized diaspora Jew, which means he'd have little to no actual knowledge of some earthly Jesus character preaching and performing miracles in Palestine at that time.

Here is my initial argument for why Hell is completely unjustified (assuming the concept of sin is valid, which I reject but for now I will accept, and also assuming that hell and the Christian God is real):

1. All humans sin but our sins our finite.
2. For this finite sin, God sentences us to infinite punishment.
3. Infinite punishment is by definition infinitely worse than finite sin and is thus insanely disproportionate.

One good comparison might be if someone was sentenced to the death penalty for jaywalking, except given that Hell is an infinite punishment even that does not begin to cover how disproportionate the punishment is.

Furthermore, why would God create us only to send us to hell? God is supposedly omnipresent and omnipotent - at the moment of creation and even before, he would know everything about how creation would unfold, including who would go to heaven and who to hell. He would know exactly which souls he created to go to hell. Could he make creation different, so that people wouldn't go to hell? Yes, but he did not. The common counter to this argument is that ""God wants to preserve free will"", but if God is both omnipotent and omnipresent, free will does not really exist as God knows everything about us and created us exactly in that way - everything we do is only because it is what God planned for us.

Some Christian rebuttals to my argument that I have seen and found unconvincing:

* ""All of our sins are forgiven through Jesus Christ, and if we only believe in him every sin is forgiven"". That sets up a condition for forgivement - our sins are still worthy of punishment but if we believe in Jesus they are forgiven. Furthermore, this sets up believing in Jesus as infinitely good and not believing as infinitely bad, as it can overcome any sin we commit on earth, which I think is somewhat ridiculous - my choosing to not believe in Jesus does no one any harm, no one here on earth and certainly not an omnipotent God.
* ""God is our creator and the source of morality, and He may do with us as he will and that is moral."" Ah, an appeal to power. If someone holds a gun to my head and says, ""Give me your wallet or I shoot you,"" is that moral? As well, the whole 'source' of morality argument falls into the [Euthyphro Dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma). Thankfully I do not see this argument much.
* ""Hell is not a place of punishment - it is simply oblivion, a separation from God, etc."" I'm surprisingly OK with this argument, as oblivion is what I believe I'm heading to regardless and I believe it is the best possible end (eternal life in heaven would get [pretty darn boring after a while](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever) (WARNING - TV TROPES LINK - DO NOT CLICK IF YOU VALUE YOUR FREE TIME)). However, the Bible does not support that notion (there are some verses which do and some which do not - as usual, the Bible is contradictory):

&gt;Do not be amazed at this, because a time is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice. (John 5:28)

&gt;and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (Matthew 13:50)

&gt;And the smoke from their torture will go up forever and ever (Revelation 14:11)

I know a lot of apparently believing Christians who have not read the Bible, have only read it a little, and don't really seem to think it matters.

If I believed that a train was going to hit me, or if I found out I had diabetes, or any other situation where it was clear something negative would happen to me if I did not act, I would do everything in my power to educate myself and learn about what I needed to do.

For this reason, I always felt that if I was religious, I would probably be a nun. If there is a god and a hell, I do NOT want to be sent to hell, and every waking minute of my life would be spent doing whatever I thought that entailed - studying, good deeds, prayer, whatever.

So when I learn that someone ""really"" believes in god but hasn't even read the Bible thoroughly and doesn't even care, I'm... completely baffled. The same feeling as if I saw a diabetic eating cake and saying, ""Oh, it'll be fine.""

Can you explain... what makes a person both believe, apparently sincerely, yet not care enough just to read the basics? If there was a reasonable thing for a god to hold us responsible for in life, it is to have read his book at least once.

It has been my experience that this applies to most Christians. Do these people think they just intuitively know what they need to? That they just sorta know what god wants, and because they have this *special understanding*, they don't need to learn from outside sources? 

That is the only way I can imagine not devoting my life to religion if I believed in a god - if I believed I had a special understanding and didn't need to try and work at it.

I hope my question made sense, and I didn't mean to offend if I did.

In fact, there's a part of me that would be happy to find out I'm wrong after death, even if it meant torment in your religion's Hell. After all, maybe God could eventually change his mind. He could decide that my failure in life to believe in something I had no reason to believe in isn't so horrible that I deserve eternal torture after all.

Take a moment to think about your own death leading not to Heaven, Hell, or some other afterlife landscape, but to simply not being. Void. Nothingness. Returning to what it was like before you were even conceived. Now compare that to how you'd feel about being in Hell.

I imagine that on a visceral level, the latter distresses you less than the former. Again, God could always change his mind for you, too, and decide you've suffered enough for your sins.

&gt; 1 Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.

Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 4 For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.
 6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

We both agreed that these are not good rules to live by, especially considering the oppression and violence which many governing authorities have brought upon their own people (religious or not, this is wasn't the issue).

This arose out of me trying to understand why some people deserved to be saved from hell while most people will never be saved. It seemed profoundly unfair. Anyway, it suddenly occurred to me that if you assume that no one deserves to be saved, then it actually is perfectly just for only some to be saved. In fact, it is the very suspension of justice via god’s grace that allows a small percentage to be saved. Essentially what I’m trying to understand is how this relates to original sin.

What it sounds like to me is that every human born carries the weight of this original sin. They are infected by evil and will therefore commit evil in their lives. This results in their inability to connect with god (and/or results in being sent to hell depending on who I talk to). Here’s my problem: I didn’t commit the original sin. Neither did anyone I have ever heard of. Most people agree that Adam and Eve didn’t literally exist. How is it that I am being held responsible for something that I (or anyone that actually exists) did? How is it that we deserve punishment (or at least don’t deserve the reward) for something that I was born with?

It is not hard to come up with an alternate scenario. We could all have been born and raised in the Garden of Eden and only be kicked out once each of us had eaten fruit.  Then everyone would actually have a say in whether they commit original sin. 


TL;DR Why is original sin inherited and how is that just?

Edit (5/2/2012 5:30pm PST): Thanks for the great responses everyone! Very interesting discussion and I've learned a lot. I will continue to read and respond off and on for a day or so if anyone else wants to continue the discussion.

1329925630.0,18,self.DebateAChristian,q108m,A few thoughts on the Fall of Man,Basilides,25,7,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/q108m/a_few_thoughts_on_the_fall_of_man/,"**1) Christians say all humans born after Adam were ""afflicted"" by original sin because of the separation between the Christian God and Man.**

But the Christian god created the entire universe. Christians are arguing that the Christian god made part of creation, if not most of creation, to be sick and disgusting and then banished Adam and Eve to this vast sick and disgusting realm.

**2) Christians say that the Christian god wants to repair the bond with humans.**

But the Christian god created the natural order, including the consequences of Adam's action. The Christian god, therefore, can alter the natural order by un-creating the consequences of Adam's action just as he altered the natural order by, for example, un-creating the natural consequences of:

* a horde of people marching into the Red Sea
* a man being eaten by a fish 
* a man being executed

**3) Christians say that the Christian god wants to repair the bond with each one of us, but that would betray on our free will, because not all of us WANT to be in that bond.**

But according to Paul, the Christian god makes *none of us* want to be in that bond. Unlike Adam and Eve, whom he did not birth into a fallen world with sinful natures, the Christian god surrounds each one of us with sin and deliberately infects each one of us with a sinful nature. He puts each one of us *as far away from him as possible*, assuming he is not as evil as the world he has put us in.

**4) Christians say we were given free will in the first place because the Christian god wanted us to choose to love him.**

But *no one chooses* to have a sinful nature. God made Adam and Eve *without* a sinful nature. What was wrong with the way the Christian god made Adam and Eve? Apparently, there was something wrong with it because the Christian god doesn't make people without sinful natures anymore. Adam and Eve supposedly had free will. But they also had *a much better shot at loving God than we do*.

In fact what kind of sick love is it when the one who loves you is so butt hurt by one mistake that he banishes his loved ones and all of their descendants from his sight forever? I wouldn't do that to my kids or my descendants. Would you?

**5) Christians make a big deal about free will.** 

But free will necessitates *the ability to make an informed decision*. The Christian god withheld information from Adam and Eve. Information which the serpent revealed. The serpent revealed, and the Christian god later confirmed, that eating the fruit did, indeed, make Adam and Eve like gods. So who really respected the free will of Adam and Eve? The Christian god or the serpent?

**6) Adam and Eve, due to their perfect unity with God, knew exactly what they were doing when they ate of the forbidden fruit.** 

If Adam and Eve ""knew exactly what they were doing"" then neither one of them were deceived. But the Bible says otherwise.

And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. (1 Tim 2:24)

So the Christian god punishes all of us with a sinful nature and with death because he failed to adequately coach Eve about the serpent and because a husband listened to his wife. It's hard to avoid the sexism of this story: The husband is guided by God. The wife is guided by Satan. All of the trouble comes when the husband listens to his wife instead of the voice inside his head.",,False,,t5_2ryd5,True,,violet brackets,True,t3_q108m,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/q108m/a_few_thoughts_on_the_fall_of_man/,

But why was a Church being established? It was being established to spread the gospel. And what better way could there be to spread the 
gospel than for the Holy Spirit to *give all of us the same information* it gave to that wicked persecutor of Christians, Saul of Tarsus?

Boasting that he received his gospel ""from no man"", Paul is the only person who ever lived who did not need to be learn about God from 
another person.

    “This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel
    after that time,” declares the LORD.
    “I will put my law in their minds
    and write it on their hearts.
    I will be their God,

    or say to one another, ‘Know the LORD,’
    because they will all know me,

    declares the LORD. (Jeremiah 31:33-34)

So far, Paul is the only person to have received the full benefit of the new covenant.

1317985907.0,19,self.DebateAChristian,l40si,TIL: Christians opposition to abortion began with the doctrines of Original Sin and the necessity for infant baptism to avoid the fires of hell.,Basilides,22,3,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/l40si/til_christians_opposition_to_abortion_began_with/,"""Aquinas’ heretical belief that infants who died with the sole guilt of original sin are happy and united to God is refuted by the Devil’s promotion of abortion. If these damned infants are happy and united to God, the Devil would be against abortion because these infants would be eternally happy and united to God and hence would have escaped enslavement to Satan. This obviously would not please Satan at all. If Aquinas’ heretical opinion were true, then Satan would want these infants to live long enough to reach the age of reason and commit a mortal sin and then die so that they would suffer eternal pain and be eternally united to him instead of being eternally happy and united to God. Simply put, Satan would be pro-life if those who died with the sole guilt of original sin are happy and united to God, for surely Satan does not want that!

We will read from a Catholic book, *Malleus Maleficarum*, that proves the Devil promotes abortion so that these dead infants will be tortured in hell for all eternity. This book, authorized by Pope Innocent VIII, was written by Frs. Kramer and Sprenger, Dominican Inquistors, whose specialty was exposing and defeating the heresy and evils of witchcraft:

MM: “For nearly three centuries *Malleus Maleficarum (the Witches’ Hammer)* was the professional manual for witch hunters. This work by two of the most famous Inquisitors of the age is still a document of force... Under a Bull of Pope Innocent VIII, Kramer and Sprenger exposed the heresy of those who did not believe in witches and set forth the proper order of the world with devils, witches, and the will of God.”

This work teaches that Satan desires to kill unbaptized babies so they can suffer pain in hell for all eternity:

MM: “Moreover (as was said in the First Part of the work), it was shown by the confession of the servant, who was brought to judgment at Breisach, that **the greatest injuries to the Faith as regards the heresy of witches are done by midwives**; and this is made clearer than daylight itself by the confessions of some who were afterwards burned. For in the diocese of Basel at the town of Dann, a witch who was burned confessed that she had killed more than forty children, by sticking a needle through the crowns of their heads into their brains, as they came out from the womb...[60] Now the reason for such practices is as follows: It is to be presumed that witches are compelled to do such things at the command of evil spirits, and sometimes against their own wills. For the devil knows that, because of the pain of loss, or original sin, such children are debarred from entering the Kingdom of Heaven.”[61] (Part II, Chap. XIII)

Hence infants who died with original sin are in the hell of the damned and suffer the pain of loss in the very least. And I believe they also suffer a degree of corporal pain by hell fire. Consequently, the Devil’s promotion of abortion is empirical evidence that those who died with the sole guilt of original sin are in eternal hell, are united to Satan and not God, and are not happy but suffer eternal pain.""

[Damned Infants](http://www.romancatholicism.org/ibranyi-damned-infants.htm#_Toc223506322)

**TL;DR** Christians swear abortion is evil. But this belief originated in the idea that infants need to be baptized in order to avoid being burned in the lake of fire for eternity by their evil god.

An issue that crops up when I occasionally debate theists is how God can love me and simultaneously send me to hell (since I'm an atheist).

A typical response to this would be that God is like a loving parent who sets the rules, and has to punish his child if they break the rules for their own good. I find this a poor analogy. No parent would chose to torture their child for all eternity. At least no parent who claimed to love their offspring.

Another response would be that it is not God who sends people to hell, it's the devil. But then who created the devil? And surely a God that loved me would rescue from such a fate if he could.

This got me thinking about Evolution. It seems to me that if God really wanted us to be ""without excuse"", there are a number of things he could have done differently:

* Different DNA coding for each species. 99.9999 % of life on this planet uses the same DNA/Amino Acid coding. We know that minor [variations in coding](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000565) are possible, so why is life so strongly biased towards the code that we have? An omnipotent creator could easily have given each species a completely novel DNA coding, yet he apparently chose not to do so. 

* Geographically isolated identical species. If God had just seen fit to create two ancestral species of Kangaroos on two islands ten thousand miles apart, the Theory of Evolution would have died in the womb.

* Unrelated physiology and microbiology. Species that resemble each other also have closely related genomes. From a biological point of view, there is no need for this to be so. God could quite easily have created Humans and Chimpanzees with completely different proteomes.

* Fossil lineage mixing. Fossils are always fixed to a specific geological strata. We never find modern mammals mixed with Dinosaurs, for example. Would it be so difficult for God to arrange for a wombat to be found in the same layer as a plesiosaur? 

* Horizontal lineage mixing. Kirk Cameron's infamous [Crocoduck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocoduck) raises an interesting question - why do major lineages never mix? Why don't we have winged rabbits? Why are there no six-legged hamsters? Surely God could create any mixture of lineages that he wanted?

* Remove vestigial forms. We humans can function perfectly well without our appendices, plantaris mucles and wisdom teeth. So why did God not simply remove them from the human body from the get-go?

We could go on, but the message should be clear - there are so many different ways that God could have ensured that the theory of evolution was a non-starter, but for some reason he didn't do so. If we are truly ""without excuse"", why did he apparently go out of his way to make it seem as if he wasn't involved in the formation of life at all?",,False,,t5_2ryd5,False,,,True,t3_h3fv0,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/h3fv0/god_evolution_and_romans_120/,

As a non-believer I find that deeply unconvincing.

The same for nudity - ever since Adam &amp; Eve were supposedly thrown out of Eden for wearing clothes, the naked human body has been considered sinful.  Ditto for masturbation, something practiced by most humans and many animal species.

It seems to me that these taboos originated from the desire of the small Jewish community in biblical time to out-reproduce its competitors, so anything that detracted from producing more babies was frowned upon.  (Ironically it is now known that masturbation increases male fertility rather than decreases it).  IMHO this early iron-age morality is out of place in the 21st century when overpopulation is a major concern, and is responsible for a lot of harm in society.  For example, homophobia, the spread of AIDS (since the Catholic church forbids condoms), and unwanted teenage pregnancies and abortions through lack of sex education and availability of contraception.

* An intentional (check)

* Unlawful (check)

* Killing (check)

* With malice aforethought, or premeditation (check)

How does an illegal abortion not meet these elements?

And if you want to argue that only the doctors should me charged with murder you still run up against conspiracy law.

And as any first year law student could tell you, all conspirators are guilty of all crimes committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. Even if you think only the doctor commits murder in an abortion the woman is still guilty of it as a co-conspirator.

The debate is VERY long, so I won't ask about all of it.  

In the first opening statement of the debate, Dan brings up a litany of amazing points about the utility of codifying 'biblical morality' into american law, especially with respect to the legalization of Gay Marriage.    Starting [ About 7 minutes in](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=oG804t0WG-c#t=406s), he explains in detail a very well-constructed, basically impenetrable argument, ending at time 13:35 in the youtube video as well.

The problem is, rather than letting this argument lie and waiting for his opponent to respond, Dan makes the poor decision to change the topic completely to something unrelated, a much weaker argument about being persecuted and libeled.  Then, when his opponent responds, his opponent ignores Dan's opening argument completely and responds only to the persecution argument, which to me was Dan's fault.

My question is this: What are some Christian responses to the argument Dan Makes in the video between time 6:50 and 13:35, which is a ery strong and well-thought out argument about 'biblical' morality.

For those who do not wish to watch the video segment, I tried to find a transcript of the segment I am describing.   

Ok, here it is: 

TRANSCRIPT:

&gt;Brian challenged us to a debate about the Bible, and I’d like to address some things in the Bible if that’s OK with Mr. Moderator.

&gt;OPPENHEIMER: It is OK.

&gt;SAVAGE: You know, I’m from a Catholic background. My dad was a Catholic deacon; my mom was a Catholic lay minister. I attended a seminary for a couple of years—a preparatory seminary, a high school seminary. I’m not unfamiliar with the Christian Bible or the Christian tradition or the Catholic tradition. There are two—you know, “In the beginning,” let’s begin with the beginning of the Bible—you get two conflicting, contradictory creation narratives right off the bat. Chapter 1 of Genesis and chapter 2 of Genesis, most Biblical scholars believe are two different creation narratives that have just been piggybacked together, or set side-by-side. Most people read them uncritically and don’t notice that everything’s created in a different order and for a different reason. At the end of the first creation narrative in Genesis, God creates “humankind.” Not Adam and Eve, but humanity itself created “in our image, male and female, He created them”—plural. And then chapter 2 of Genesis, a couple of verses in, it all starts over again. We have another creation narrative. And everything’s created for a different reason, in a different order. Man is created first and placed in what must have been a very depressing garden because God had not yet created plants. He places man in a garden and then creates plants. And then God says, “It is not good for man to be alone.” And His response to that dilemma for man is not to create woman—not yet—but is to create animals. And He brings the animals to Adam; he names them. Adam has some agency and some choice here; he’s allowed to express a preference. And he rejects all of these animals as potential partners, so God creates Eve.

&gt;And why does He create Eve? To create a co-parent for Adam? No, to create a partner for Adam, because “it is not good for man to be alone.” The message of Eve, before they get down to the being fruitful and multiplying, is the original purpose of Eve’s is companionship, because it is not good for man to be alone. The contradictions—and of course, both of these stories, these creation narratives, can’t be literally true. I think if you’re a Christian, who believes that the Bible is literally true, the inerrant word of God, here is God telling you in the first three pages that you can’t take what comes next literally because there’s a contradiction here, and a massive one. That was my father’s interpretation of the first two books of Genesis, is God opens with the, “Here are two beautiful stories, you have to work out the meanings; obviously you can’t take the Bible literally word for word.”

&gt;The contradictions continue. “Thou shalt not kill”—the Israelites spend a whole lot of time killing people on God’s orders. Jesus says the old law must be followed; Paul contradicts him.

&gt;The one place, and this is what I said that was so controversial at the journalism conference, where there isn’t really a conflict in the Bible is slavery. Leviticus 25:44-46: “As for your male and female slaves, whom you may have: You may buy male and female slaves from the nations that are around you. They may be your property. You may bequeath them to your sons after you to inherit as a possession forever.” In the New Testament, Timothy: “Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and the teaching may not be defamed. If anyone teaches otherwise, and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with Godliness, he is puffed up with conceit; he knows nothing.” This is a verse that was thrown in the face of American abolitionists, before and during the second—or the Civil War. The Reverend Richard Fuller, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, in the years before the Civil War was able to say, with a straight face and because it’s true, “What God has sanctioned in the Old Testament and permitted in the New cannot be the sin.”

&gt;Like I said to the high school journalism students, Sam Harris in his book, Letter to a Christian Nation, says the Bible got the easiest moral question that humanity has ever faced wrong, and that was slavery. And my—[?]—my point was that the Bible, if it got something as easy and obvious as slavery wrong, what are the odds that the Bible got something as complicated as human sexuality wrong? I put those odds at about 100 percent. Pat Robertson was recently asked about this. I don’t know if you saw that clip? [Brown shakes his head.] On the—his show, he was asked if America was founded as a Christian nation, why did we allow slavery? And he answer was, “Like it or not, if you read the Bible, in the Old Testament slavery is permitted.” That’s a half-truth; in both Testaments slavery is permitted and sanctioned. But then Robertson said something uncharacteristically profound: “We have moved in our conception of the value of human beings until we realized that slavery was terribly wrong.” And so what he’s saying there is not just that we realized slavery was wrong; also we realized the Bible was wrong about slavery.

&gt;I don’t think LGBT Americans are asking American Christians to do anything that you haven’t already done. Move in your conception of the value of human beings. In this instance, human beings who happen to be gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered. Many American Christians—we know you can move, because many American Christians have already moved in their value of the conception of human beings, because many American Christians, including a majority of American Catholics, support marriage rights for—support same-sex—rights for same-sex couples. Not a majority for marriage, but a majority for either civil unions, all incidents of marriage, and/or marriage. I don’t think support for our full civil equality requires fundamental—or evangelical Christians, or Catholics, or anyone else to change their theology, to change their perspective on the morality of what it means to be gay. Just to sign off on our full civil equality. Tolerate doesn’t mean celebrate; tolerate means endure or put up with. And I think that Christians—conservative Christians—can learn to tolerate legal civil same-sex marriage the way they’ve learned to tolerate legal divorce, which violates Catholic teaching, interfaith marriages, and non-religious marriages.

&gt;You know, John Shore, who’s a Christian blogger, a pro-gay-marriage Christian blogger and author, he says that the Bible has no place in a conversation about the legality or illegality of gay marriage. Illegal is not a religious term. In a pluralistic society, you know, people are free to live their religious values. And I believe people are free to proselytize. If somebody wants to talk me out of my marriage to Terry, I think that they should knock themselves out. I don’t think that they have a right to use the law to do that, to deny us equal protection under the law because of their interpretation of the Bible, or their interpretation of God’s will. Imposing your interpretation of the Bible on someone else is not religious freedom, as you’ve attempted to redefine it.

Here we are talking about the heavy rock paradox, can God create a rock so heavy that he cannot lift it. My position is that omnipotence does not mean God can do what is logically impossible, putting logic above God. A Christian responds to me to argue that this is not true, that logic is not above God, and that the question doesn't make any sense... Feel free to read the actual conversation linked above, but here is an overview of it:

Him: The question doesn't make sense, God does not lift things like we do, he is supernatural.

Me: Why doesn't the question make sense, God can create rocks and God can lift them, right?

Him: Yes God can create rocks, but God does not lift things the way we do. The question is broken.

Me: So what, it doesn't matter how God lifts things. Can God cause a rock to lift into the air or not?

Him: ""Yup, I'm going to ignore you on RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite). See ya!""

Clearly, when confronted with this paradox that he could not answer, he chose to try to dismiss the question as being unsound. When I demonstrated that the question was sound, that God can create rocks and cause them to lift into the air, he retreated rather than acknowledging the problem and adjusting his beliefs accordingly.

1346100188.0,18,self.DebateAChristian,yx7y2,A few questions for Christians about a Bible passage.,joshisneat,22,4,276,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/yx7y2/a_few_questions_for_christians_about_a_bible/,"I don't mean to be disrespectful or cynical but I have legitimate questions regarding the following passage and I would love to have answers from honest Christians.

The passage in question is Numbers 15:32-36:

32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.

33 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

34 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.

35 And the Lord said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.

36 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses.


And here are my questions:

1. Do you believe this actually happened? Was a man stoned to death for gathering sticks on the Sabbath?
2. Is the God who ordered this man be stoned the same God you worship in church on Sundays?
3. This man was killed, possibly leaving behind a widow and fatherless children, and worse, burning in Hell for eternity (he surely didn't get executed by God and end up in Heaven, did he?) Do you think this punishment was just? 
4. I recognize that Jesus ""fulfilled"" the law as Savior (NOT abolished but fulfilled), and thus, such punishment is no longer necessary, but doesn't the fact that such a penalty EVER existed make the whole thing seem crazy? Why make a rule like this? To show us that we need a savior? From what, the crazy rules? That God himself made, and now has to send his son to save us from? Really?
5. Surely this story sparks even the slightest feeling of injustice. Your answers to any of these questions may be, ""God did it, so who are we to question?"" But is it not your very God-given morals that are sensing the injustice? After all, good morals and good conscience come from God, correct?

Thanks and again I don't mean to be cynical, when I read the passage these were my immediate questions and I would love your perspective.",,False,,t5_2ryd5,False,,blue brackets,True,t3_yx7y2,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/yx7y2/a_few_questions_for_christians_about_a_bible/,
1345732342.0,18,self.DebateAChristian,yp3g4,The Christian Philosophers Double Standard,dblthnk,21,3,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/yp3g4/the_christian_philosophers_double_standard/,"To respond to criticisms about the divine origin of the Bible and the problem of evil, the Christian philosopher’s main defense is an appeal to ignorance. He will say that yes the Bible appears to have been written by fallible bronze age people whose religion evolved organically out of Canaanite polytheism, but to declare that it couldn’t be true is to commit the genetic fallacy because no matter how sketchy and unbelievable something’s origin is, it could still be true. And he will say that yes the problem of evil and what we define God’s nature to be appear incompatible, but we can simply add another premise, that God has reasonably sufficient moral justification to allow evil. So the Bible could still have been inspired by God even though it doesn’t look like it and even though we can only speculate at what God’s justifications for allowing evil are, with no way to demonstrate any of them, God could still have some unknowable moral justification for allowing evil.

So, even though the Christian philosopher cannot demonstrate in any way that he is correct, because he COULD hypothetically be correct, the arguments against the divine origin of the Bible or the incompatibility of God and evil are moot and the Christian philosopher walks away triumphant. However, appeals to ignorance are not accepted when inconvenient for the Christian philosopher, with regard to the origin of the universe specifically.

William Lane Craig has simply declared the issue settled in the second premise of his Teleological Argument when we really know almost nothing about it. Dozens of unprovable and unfalsifiable science based philosophical speculations about the origin of the universe are dismissed with the little or no justification or suggested to be absurd with little or no justification. Why is the non-Christian required to scientifically demonstrate them to be true before we accept the idea that they COULD be true?

What if I speculated that through some unknown and untestable natural law, an eternal, timeless, primordial vacuum that contained only quantum phenomena and natural laws, in what can be described as “empty” space, spontaneously spawned a multiverse of 10 to the 500th universes with one and only one for each possible variation of the fundamental constants. None of the universes interact with each other in any major way and can exist in the same “space” as each other. There will be an untold number of universes that have the right ratios of fundamental constants to support our kind of life and each of these universes could have beings like us in them wondering how it all happened.

Am I right? I don’t know. Can you prove me wrong? No, not yet at least. But, why is this answer not acceptable to the theist when his unprovable and unfalsifiable explanation for the origin of the Bible and the problem of evil are perfectly acceptable to him?

Many artists have admitted to ""selling"" their souls to Satan for fame and fortune. Many artists have also admitted themselves to channeling or being a conduit for evil spirits to create or perform their music. Remember, these are the artists saying themselves and the people around them that have said they are possessed or feel like the music is channeled through them.

Tori Amos said ""I think music comes through dimensions, it`s arrogant to think you can create music on your own, there`s a co-creation going on. I don`t know with whom, but there is this well that we all tap into"". She once said ""I wanted to marry Lucifer I don't consider Lucifer an evil force .I feel his presence with his music. I feel like he comes and sits on my piano"". She even made a song dedicated to Lucifer. In the following performances she gets down right freaky. Watch after 4:00

Another video. (Can you honestly say she doesn't look demon possessed?) 
In 1974, JONI MITCHELL told the press of a male spirit who helps her write music. “Joni Mitchell credits her creative powers to a ‘male muse’ she identifies as Art. He has taken so much control of not only her music, but her life, that she feels married to him, and often roams naked with him on her 40-acre estate. His hold over her is so strong that she will excuse herself from parties and forsake lovers whenever he ‘calls’” (Why Knock Rock? p. 112, citing Time magazine, Dec. 16, 1974, p. 39).

Lady Gaga apparently gets her music from demons. She said herself that she has the spirit of her dead aunt living inside her (which is really a demon) and that the spirit of Alexander McQueen wrote a song for her called Judas where I presume she expresses sympathy for Judas who betrayed Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God. She also says she bought a 'ghost buster machine' worth thousands of dollars because she said she is convinced evil spirits are haunting her. She also expressed that she had terrible nightmares with occult imagery but she would use it as inspiration for her stage acts which would consist of a mock self sacrifice and hanging by noose. Satan is obviously using Gaga for his agenda - brainwashing the masses.

John Lennon is believed to have ""sold"" his soul or made a deal with the devil, in fact he said it himself. There is even a book about it called The Lennon Prophecy. The Beatles channeled evil spirits as those in his inner circle revealed. John Lennon once said ""When the real music comes to me it has nothing to do with 'cause I'm just a channel. It's given to me and I transcribe it like a channel."" He once referred to himself as a hollow temple in which the spirits would inhabit him then leave to be inhabited by another. When asked why The Beatles were so successful he said himself ""I my soul to the devil"" (Ray Coleman, Lennon, McGraw-hill)

Kurt Cobain did say his life's goal was to “get stoned and worship Satan” (op. cit. Sandford, p. 42).

Kurt Cobain was obsessed with Satanist Anton Levay, Cobain even wanted Levay to record a song with him. Cobain was known to desecrate churches by writing ""God is gay"" and other blasphemies. He it was reported that he was involved in witchcraft. Indeed he did channel demons as Cobain is described as “stumbling on melodies by means he himself didn’t fully understand.” (op. cit. Sanders, p. 70).

His widow, after his suicide, would state that “Kurt had a lot of personal inner [expletive deleted] demons, a lot of frailties and physical ailments.” Sandford would state in his biography, “He was a diffident, yet aggressive personality who struggled with demons that drove and tormented him” (Sandford p. 97)

It said that Cobain killed himself because the demonic entities stopped channeling lyrics through him. In his suicide note he would write, “I haven’t felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music, along with really writing, for too many years now.” Sandford has stated, “In his suicide note, Cobain despaired that his muse had flown south…” (Ibid. p. 361).

ANGUS YOUNG, lead guitarist for AC-DC, is called the “guitar demon”; and he admitted that something takes control of the band during their concerts: “...it’s like I’m on automatic pilot. By the time we’re halfway through the first number someone else is steering me. I’m just along for the ride. I become possessed when I get on stage” (Hit Parader, July 1985, p. 60).

The so called father of Rock and Roll Robert Johnson believed to have ""sold"" his soul for guitar playing abilities and fame. People who knew him spoke about it.

Brian Wilson, from The Beach Boys who once said ""We were doing witchcraft, trying to make witchcraft music"" admitted that he was tormented by voices in his head that would distract and torment him. Records president Larry Waronker claims to have encountered at least five different entities that use Brian Wilson's body as their home.

Jimi Hendrix believed he was possessed by demonic spirits. His girlfriend admitted it as well. His producer also stated that he believed he was possessed. Hendrix begged his girlfriend for help and he felt that the voices in his head were tormenting him. 

Black Sabbath 's Ozzy Osbourne admitted he was being used by some outside external force:

""I really wish I knew why I’ve done some of the things I’ve done over the years. Sometimes I think that I’m possessed by some outside spirit. A few years ago, I was convinced of that – I thought I truly was possessed by the devil. I remember sitting through the Exorcist a dozen times, saying to myself, ‘Yeah, I can relate to that.’"" (Hit Parader, Nov., 1984, p. 49)

As a matter of fact the whole band had experienced dark, demonic forces as they dabbled with the occult.

""Geezer’s encounters with the supernatural continued. During recording of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath in Bel Air, the bassist felt an ominous presence fill his bedroom. He looked up to see several specters glaring at him from above with overpowering effect. Awash with fear, he immediately awakened Bill, Tony, and Ozzy to tell them what has happened. Geezer soon discovered that all of his fellow bandmates had experienced similar events. . . To Sabbath it was obvious that a dark, ominous cloud was looming over them.""(Black Sabbath : The Ozzy Osbourne Years, p. 19)


Elvis Presley is believed to have been demonic possessed. People who knew him said he had occultic powers.

Carlos Santana admitted he channeled a spirit to make his music. He even has a name for it Metatron:

""Metatron is an angel. Santana has been in regular contact with him since 1994. Carlos will sit here facing the wall, the candles lit. He has a yellow legal pad at one side, ready for the communications that will come. 'It's kind of like a fax machine,' he says.""

Jim Morrison himself believed he was a sort of a shaman and that spirits used him for his music. His producer Paul Rothschild said that the most pivotal part of his life is when this spirit entered him. This is all stated in the book ""Break on Through: The Life and Death of Jim Morrison"". At Venice Beach before he became famous he said ""In that year there was an intense visitation of energy. I left school and went down to the beach to live. slept on a roof... I met the SPIRIT OF MUSIC. AN APPEARANCE OF HE DEVIL on a Venice canal. Running., I saw SATAN..."" (The Lost Writings of Jim Morrison)


Jimmy Page , who was a devout follower of Satanist Aliester Crowley, was believed to be used as a vehicle for demonic spirits in his music. Other members of Led Zeppelin were said to experience 'automatic writing': ""He [Robert Plant ] often remarked that he could feel his pen being pushed by some higher authority."" (Stephen Davis, Hammer of the Gods, p. 262). In one of their songs when played backwards you can actually hear demonic messages

Bob Dylan implied he made a deal with the Devil whom he called chief

Katy Perry admitted she sold her soul to the devil.

Most of rock music and the culture it promotes are of things against God or good, is it hard to imagine there is a Satanic spirit behind it? Even several Rock musicians admitted the music was of the devil:

David Bowie in Rolling Stone magazine (Feb. 12, 1976), stunned the music world, when he stated:
""Rock has always been THE DEVIL'S MUSIC . . . I believe rock and roll is dangerous . . . I feel we're only heralding SOMETHING EVEN DARKER THAN OURSELVES.""

Little Richard has testified that rock music is demonic:

""My true belief about Rock 'n' Roll--and there have been a lot of phrases attributed to me over the years--is this: I believe this kind of music is demonic. ... A lot of the beats in music today are taken from voodoo, from the voodoo drums. If you study music in rhythms, like I have, you'll see that is true. I believe that kind of music is driving people from Christ. It is contagious"" (Little Richard, quoted by Charles White, The Life and Times of Little Richard, p. 197).

""I was directed and commanded by another power. The power of darkness ... The power that a lot of people don't believe exists. The power of the Devil. Satan"" (Little Richard, quoted in The Life and Times of Little Richard, pp. 205,206).

Eminem said he sold his soul in his rap song ""Goodbye Hollywood""

""What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, i'm trapped
If I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, i'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact""

Also in his song ""My Darling he retells the deal he had with the devil.

In his autobiography ""The Doggfather"", Snoop Dogg says the devil came
to him to make a deal that he would be rich and famous in exchange for
his soul. Snoop accepted the devil's offer (by his own words) and identifies that the point at which Calvin Broadus dies Snoop Dog was born.

FROM THE SONG ""LET ME FLY"". In this song, DMX explains that he sold his soul to the devil and exactly why he did it etc.

""I sold my soul to the devil, and the price was cheap. A yo it's cold on this level cause it's twice as deep. But you don't hear me, ignorance is blisning and so on Sometimes it's better to be taught dumb. Shall I go on. You don't want no real, what the deal is a mystery. How is it I can live and make history If you don't see it then it, wasn't ment for you to see
If you wasn't born wit' it then, it wasn't ment for you to be But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be hound lock down in a cell wit' a soul gettin' dwelled This is hell, go get the devil and get me the key but can't be worst than the curse that was given ta me It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone ""

Apparently, it turns out Satan was not happy that Heavy Metal was not reaching Black people. So he created that Hip Hop to reach 'brothers' and cross all kinds of ethnic &amp; cultural barriers.

Pastor Craig Lewis speaks about it here

Watch this wonderful testimony of a rapper who was close to selling his soul for a money but chose to walk with Christ.


A former Satan worshiper, John Todd, explains how record companies conjure up evil spirits and use witchcraft to brainwash people through Rock and Roll. Mind you this was taped around 40 years ago.



The Eagles were involved with the Church of Satan 
The so called father of Rock and Roll Robert Johnson believed to sold his soul for guitar playing abilities and fame 
Jimi Hendrex believed he was possessed by demonic spirits. His girlfriend admitted it as well. 
Michael Jackson was heavily involved in the occult. He admitted he had a room full of mirrors so he could communicate with a spirit. Jackson said he would go to sleep for days with the aid of drugs so he can get songs from the spirits or else the music of the spirits would be given to Prince. Jackson said “I wake up from dreams and go ‘Wow, put this down on paper,’ the whole thing is strange. You hear the words, everything is right there in front of your face. I feel that somewhere, someplace it’s been done and I’m just a courier bringing it into the world” (MICHAEL JACKSON, Rolling Stone, Feb. 17, 1983). 
GINGER BAKER, drummer for the popular ‘60s band CREAM, said: “It happens to us quite often--it feels as though I’m not playing my instrument, something else is playing it and that same thing is playing all three of our instruments. That’s what I mean when I say it’s frightening sometimes. Maybe we’ll all play the same phrase out of nowhere. It happens very often with us” (Bob Larson, Rock and the Church, p. 66).

The original recording of “I Put a Spell on You” was done after the SCREAMIN’ JAY HAWKINS and his band members got drunk and “some type of presence seemed to seize him.” He began “grunting, growling, screaming, gurgling in strange unknown tongues, and wildly dancing around the studio” (Heartbeat of the Dragon, p. 40).

Prince admitted he had 2 other people living inside him [really evil spirits] and that he changed his name to Formerly Known as Prince because he didn't know what the spirits wanted to call him 0A419B3E0058F3B8&amp;index=27&amp;playnext=3 @2:54

Eazy E revealed his Satanism and how Satan helped moved him along in his career 
The Bible is clear that Satan has control of the world until Christ returns. Satan even offered Jesus the kingdoms of the world if Jesus worshiped him so surely he can offer people fame and fortune if you served him. Satan is using music to pull people away from God.

Satan certainly has musical abilities. It is believed he was a minister of music in heaven before he got kicked out because iniquity was found in him. In Ezekiel 28:13 - ""Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: THE WORKMANSHIP OF THY TIMBRELS AND OF THY PIPES WAS PREPARED IN THE DAY THAT THOU WAST CREATED.""

Isaiah14:11-12 ""Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols [stringed instruments]: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!

We only have to look around us at the music industry and its ""Rock, rap and Pop stars"" to see how much of an influence Satan has on music and its corruption, it is most certainly one of the devils strongest tools to corrupt the Word of God and influence the lost away from Godliness and to place strongholds on them via music. The signs and symbols are prevalent in music videos and in stage performances.

Spiritual warfare is certainly going on: ""For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities , against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places."" -- Ephesians 6:12

There is a battle going on for your soul. The choice is either Jesus Christ or Satan.

To them a gay son is like disabled son or mentally ill son or a perpetually unemployed son - a difficulty in the family, a cross they must carry, a problem in the family but _in_ the family, they cannot simply get rid of the problem by shutting the problematic person _out_ of the family.

For a while when I was a young teen I wanted very much to believe and to have a personal relationship with God.  Now, I don't mean to make this sound overly dramatic but I didn't exactly have an easy time back then.  My early teen years were a very dark, very sad time.  

I was at a church camp as the guest of a friend.  I remember seeing everyone in the camp around a big fire doing what people do at church camps and generally being in the spirit - I however could not.  I was never truly a believer.  I felt like a total outsider, completely alone.  I prayed to whatever was out there listening to show me *something*, something unequivocal to assure me that there was a God and a plan for me.  I was open to belief.  I wanted it badly.

It never came.

No signs, no reassurance, no connection, no tingly feeling...  Nothing.  For years.  As I got older I saw not just Christianity but spirituality as hollow.  I could not suspend disbelief enough for the claims of religion to make sense to me.  The gulf deepened as I got older.  I'm now about as firm an atheist as one can be.

I don't think that belief is a choice.  You either do believe or you don't, anything else being false faith.  You find something to be true and treat it as fact but one cannot find something to be false and will oneself to agree with it.

I've spoken to Christians that say that if you ask for a sign you'll receive it.  As I said, it didn't work for me.  What would you say to a decent man that honestly sought out God and did not find him?

The authorities that exist have been established by God."" (Romans 13)**

God established the government that crucified Jesus. And the God-established government did not understand God's wisdom....

**""7 No, we declare God’s wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. 8 None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."" (1 Corinthians 2)**

What is the significance of having a government established by God if said government does not even understand what God wants the government to do?

**""2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3 For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong."" (Romans 13)**

Jesus' experience in the Garden of Gethsemane suggests that he felt terror and apprehension at the thought of receiving the ultimate punishment from the God-instituted government. But Paul says that ""rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong."" 

**""Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended."" (Romans 13)** 

Odd. Jesus supposedly did nothing *but* right. Yet he was *not* commended by the God-instituted government and he was *not* free from fear of being crucified by the one in authority. Was Paul not aware of the gospel story of a man named Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified by the Roman government during the reign of Tiberius?

**""4 For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good."" (Romans 13)** 

God's servant crucified Jesus for his own good.

**""But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason."" (Romans 13)**

Ah. Apparently, Jesus did wrong.

**""They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer."" (Romans 13)** 

Ah. Apparently Jesus was a wrongdoer.

Romans 13 kinda makes me wonder if Paul was not preaching a different gospel from the one preached by the apostles, a gospel about a cosmic Christ and not a terrestrial Jesus of Nazareth.

Maybe Paul was talking about those ""certain men who came from James"" (Galatians 2:11) when he said the following...?

**6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— 7 which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if *we or an angel from heaven* should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse!**

Strange that Paul would invoke the authority of an ""angel from heaven"" when speaking of heretics. Maybe what he meant was....

""Even if *Jesus Christ's hand-picked Apostles* should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse!""

** 9 As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse! (Galatians 1)**

Would Paul say such nasty things about the representatives of the Jerusalem church?

He said worse.

**12 As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves! (Galatians 5:12)**

Maybe those ""certain men from James"" were ""trying to pervert the gospel of Christ"" by saying that Christ was a recently deceased carpenter from Galilee?

For it is written:

   “'He will command his angels concerning you, 
   and they will lift you up in their hands, 
   so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'”

 7 Jesus answered him, “It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'”

Here is the question:

What would happen if Jesus jumped off the temple?  Would God keep his promise to keep Jesus safe?  Or would God break his promise to protect Jesus because Jesus actually had enough faith to believe the promise?

Now for your life.  If the Bible makes a claim such as:

1. ""pray and you will be healed""

2. ""accept Jesus and you'll go to Heaven""

3. ""God is present when two or three come together""

4. ""come unto me and I will give you rest.""  

5. ""handling snakes and drinking poison is OK""


Are you not also testing God by believing these claims and acting on them?  Anytime God makes a promise, are you not ""testing"" Him by believing that promise and acting on it?

Then you say, ""Wow, that sounds like a great deal, I'll gladly buy many of them if this claim is true.  Here put one on and I'll shoot the vest.""  To which the vender replies, ""No. You aren't actually supposed to shoot at the vest.  If you want to test it, then the deals off."" This leaves the potential buyer scratching his head.

Could it be that this whole ""do not test God"" is nothing more than a convient excuse for God's absence?

This is recorded in Acts 12.

According to Acts 12, Jesus stands by and allows James, brother of the beloved disciple, to be martyred while in the very next passage He saves Peter from the same fate by having Peter's chains fall off and the prison doors swing open. The motif of chains falling off and prison doors swinging open, BTW, is plagiarized from an ancient Greek play, The Bacchae. 

In the next passage of Acts 12 Jesus kills the king who had James put to death. Wouldn't it have been more kind to save James? Apparently, Jesus wanted the brother of his favorite disciple to be murdered in order to spread the faith. The Lord certainly works in mysterious ways.

Other than that one passage in Acts, the only evidence we have for martyrdom of Apostles is relatively late Church Tradition claiming that Jesus' original band of merry men died martyr's deaths. The Bible does have Jesus sort of prophesying that Peter would be martyred. But then the Bible also has Jesus prophesying that, within the lifetime of the generation alive to hear him speak, Jesus would return to earth to destroy all of his enemies and take over the world.

But on to the main subject of this post. Assuming any of the disciples *did* die violent deaths, we do not know why they were killed. 

We know that the Pharisees were jealous of the Apostles for their popularity and/or performance of miracles. We know that the Jews opposed the Christians for their attempts to persuade people to abandon the Mosaic law. And we know that the Roman civil authorities opposed Christians for their refusal to participate in offerings to the gods of Rome. Early Christians could have been killed for reasons other than belief in a resurrection. And just what did these earliest Christians believe about the resurrection?

According to the earliest secular sources, the first believers to be martyred, worshiped a god named, ""Chrestus"".

""...Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Chrestians by the populace. Chrestus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus,...""

(Tacitus, Annals, 116 AD, book 15, chapter 44)

In Matthew, an angel appears after the disclosing of the empty tomb and announces the resurrection. The angel does not go into details on how God went about it or what the scene was like.  The same for Mark. In Luke, there is no angel and Jesus does not tell them what being dead was like, what he experienced or did not experience for three days while dead, or the circumstances of his rebirth. Ditto for John.

Does this absence of detail seem to be a deficiency in the story, considering the important aspect of the resurrection to the Christian faith? As a Christian, would you like to have more details about what it was like?

There were no witnesses to the event so this may be a reason. However, there were no human witnesses to other events described in the Bible; perhaps most notably the temptation of Jesus by the Devil in the desert. Jesus and the Devil were alone, and yet their conversations and interactions are described in detail. Presumably Jesus told his disciples these events and they were then recorded. But Jesus did not commit the same attention to describing the details of his ressurection? 

While researching I found [this](http://www.jude3.net/JWRES.HTM) Jehovah's Witness page that collects all the other passages referring to resurrection in the Bible. They are all first-hand accounts that describe in detail the actions of the person reborn. But for Jesus we have nothing like this. We only have past tense declarations that he is risen with no eyewitnesses, no detail, no narration, and we are given no indication of what it was like.

Does the absence of detail lend credence to the Jesus myth theory that the story is built around a kernel of truth about a Jewish leader who was crucified and his followers, in their grief, chose or unknowingly found themselves continuing his story and adding explanations for why he died?",,False,,t5_2ryd5,False,,,True,t3_h49r6,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/h49r6/the_resurrection_of_jesus_was_never_described_or/,

&gt;A baby is born to a goddess.  Upon his birth, she brings everyone around to see him.

The mother insists until finally he does, and when he does, the baby's head is turned to ash.  The mother starts crying, but soon God comes and finds an elephant that has just died, and takes the elephants head and puts it on the baby.  From then on for the rest of his life, he has the body of a human and the head of an elephant..



OK, the reason I ask this isn't to mock *anybodys* faith.  This is the hstory of how Ganesha (a famous diety among HIndus) received his elephant head.  I used to be fairly religious, and my boss grew up as a Hindu.  He told this story to my co worker who was also religious like me.  Later on we were in a car together, and she started laughing and was like ""I have to tell you this story from ____'s religion!""  and she began to tell me the story.  She was like ""can you believe how crazy it is?  Who could ever believe such a religion?""  

Anyway it really got me thinking.  What was so different from *my* religion?  I asked her, but she just kept saying there's was illogical yet the miracles in our religion were because of God.  The reasoning made no sense  

Anyway I'm curious what others would think.  Does this story not sound illogical and made up to you?  Could you ever convince yourself to believe such a thing?  If not, why do you think you believe some in the miracles of the Bible, etc?  And do you realize there are many people who believe this story just as much?

I know that the Christian faith views homosexuals as sinners and holds that their relationships are detestable and evil. This is borne out (based on my limited understanding of the Bible) by the passages Leviticus 18:22 which states

&gt;*Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable.*

and by Leviticus 20:13 which states

&gt;*If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.*

I've also noticed that Christians tend to revile abortion under any and all circumstances. This is borne out by the verses Jeremiah 1:4-5 which states

&gt;*Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying: ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born I sanctified you...*

and verse Luke 1:15, which states

&gt;*...and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.*

My question stems from the fact I've noticed that, whereas some rules from the Bible are held as hard-and-fast moral laws, other rules are held to be metaphorical. I'll include a few examples.

The rule which says all houses must have a parapet around the roof (Deuteronomy 22:8).

&gt;*When you build a new house, make a parapet around your roof so that you may not bring the guilt of bloodshed on your house if someone falls from the roof.*

The passage forbidding the eating of rare (bloody) meat (Leviticus 7:26-27)

&gt;*And wherever you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal.  Anyone who eats blood must be cut off from their people.*

The passage which forbids haircuts and shaving (Leviticus 19:27)
&gt;*Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.*

The passages which forbid the eating of certain meats (Leviticus 11:6-12)

&gt;*The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you. And the pig, though it has a divided hoof, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you. Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams you may eat any that have fins and scales. But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scales—whether among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the water—you are to regard as unclean. And since you are to regard them as unclean, you must not eat their meat; you must regard their carcasses as unclean. Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be regarded as unclean by you.*

My question, at length, is this:

How is it decided which rules in the Bible can be broken without it being a sin, and which rules must be followed in order to get into Heaven?

Case in point, how do Evangelical Christian groups justify their assertions that homosexuals and pro-choice organizations are immoral and should be purged from society, when they do not voice any objections to houses without parapets, restaurants and homes which serve meat rare, barbers and hair stylists, places which sell shaving devices, or restaurants and homes which serve things like rabbit, pork, and shellfish?

1)God is omniscient so He would understand intimately each detail of my life and why I did not accept the explanations other people gave for his existence. ""I would not have to make any excuses"". God would see each step in my life and see why I cared about what I believed, why I believed it, and why I tried to be the best person I could be.

2)If I met god, and he was real as many christians describe him: giving damnation to all those who did not accept the reality of his existence, let alone the sacrifice of Jesus, I don't know how I would feel even on the off chance I was allowed to stay in His presence considering some of the people I cared about most in the world would be suffering and/or destroyed.

3) I don't know, watch the video. That's why I liked it so much.

What say you Christians?  Ever notice how prayer only ""works"" with  things like cancer or other illnesses that can sometimes fix themselves? Sure, there have been people in dire straits or with really rare or normally not survivable conditions that have been healed of things, but nothing REALLY crazy like growing a new arm or head or being resurrected after decomposition has set in.    

It has been shown prayer has no effect on illness time and time again.  (Review the most recent STEP study for further reading on the matter.) Anyway, the data suggest prayer is wish thinking and nothing more.  

What say you?  (I really hope I don't get the cop-out response of ""You pray to have peace, not to see results"" because that really isn't how prayer is viewed OR utilized by most Christians.)

Believing the spirit of my great, great grandfather, who I never met, is with me and protecting me cannot evoke love.  If God wants my love he has to seem real.

 For instance: When a Christian gets sick, they see a Doctor and get the bounty of modern medicine. When they need a car, they get one designed by an engineer. When they need safe food, they have people inspect their food.

 They do not pray the illness away and shun a doctor, though their God should be more powerful than a doctor. They do not have divine inspiration in their tools or vehicles, though their God should be smarter than any engineer. They do not pray their food is healthy, though God should protect them.

 One is more likely to avoid traffic than to expect their faith to shield them.

 Further, Christians tend to be very closed to questioning their God. It is offensive. This shows a great deal of insecurity towards their faith; it must be confirmed, never questioned, else the fragile walls might crumble. The dam might bust, and the truth might flood in.

 It is very, very rare for a Christian to objectively question their God.

 So what are we left with?

 We are left with people who 'believe', so long as they can keep their head turned and so long as the crowd gives them a bit of confidence so they needn't stand alone. 

 We are left with people who go throughout their day acting practically, as if there were no one watching them, no one protecting them but themselves and other humans.

 To make a long story short: 

 Christians who 'believe' in their God still rely solely upon humans to protect them. They clearly put much more faith in the power of one man than their omnipotent being. Either they do not believe God is real, or they believe God is remarkably weak.

 Christians who 'believe' in Heaven will go to great lengths to extend their life here on earth. Ergo, they do not truly believe heaven exists, else they'd wish to arrive there post-haste. Why spend years fighting a remarkably painful illness when one could have eternal paradise?

So, let's kick the tires on a modified version of the classic Euthyphro dilemma; if it holds water, I respectfully submit that we ought christen it the “USS Anti-Craig.”

**Definitions:**

* 
A thing is said to be *objective* if its truth value is independent of any consciousness. Sound logical arguments provide us with an example: if A implies B, and A is true, then B is objectively true.  Conversely, a thing is said to be *subjective* if its truth value is dependent on some consciousness. Emotions are subjective things: happiness cannot exist apart from consciousness, and thus is only able to exist subjectively.

* 
An action is said to be *moral* if it is imperative: we ought to perform moral actions.  Similarly, a *moral system* is a set of moral actions.  For example, if a moral system were to include altruism, then conscious beings would have a moral obligation to be altruistic.  To fail to do so would be *immoral*.

* 
*God* is Yahweh, the perfect, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent ~~lovable rascal~~ divine entity of Christianity.

With these definitions in mind, I wish to propose the following: **if God exists, then an objective moral system does not exist.**  Consider the following:

If God commands actions because they are moral, then some moral system exists apart from God.  Because God is a perfect being, he is not able to fail to perform an imperative action.  Rephrased, God cannot be immoral, and cannot command immoral actions.  However, God is omnipotent; thus God is able to command any action, including immoral actions.  But this is paradoxical.  Because the existence of a moral system apart from God would directly contradict his fundamental nature, we can eliminate the possibility of such a system entirely.

From this, we can conclude that *all* moral actions are moral because they are commanded by God, because no moral actions *can* exist apart from God.  Because of this, all moral actions are subjective since their truth is dependent on God’s consciousness.  Therefore, an objective moral system does not exist.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but Jesus Christ did not sin while he was on Earth.  To what extent do you, or other Christians that you've heard of, believe his divinity went in terms of physical perfection?

He claims to perform physical miracles, but was his body a physical miracle?  I think it could be argued the inability of Jesus Christ to process food at 100% efficiency would be considered a challenge to his divinity.  Was Jesus Christ incredibly good looking because he was so symmetrical?  Did he look at all like his 'Earthly parents'?  Did Jesus ever have an erection?  Did he fart?  Did he ever cough or sneeze?  I know it's not knowable, just something I had never really thought of when I previously believed.

I know that it sounds like I'm trying to mock him or the religion, I swear that I am not.  The thing is, there are many physical and biological claims about Jesus Christ.  I think it's also valid to speculate on the nature of his physical body.  He obviously bled and appeared to experience pain and negative emotion.  

I guess the main question is do you believe in the physical perfection of Jesus Christ?  Is this ever addressed in scripture?

If this is your first time considering this, what are your initial thoughts on the matter?  Again, I'm really not trying to mock, and I know that these questions are essentially unanswerable, I was just curious as to the opinions of believers.

Some people have made the point that a portion of the purpose for Jesus' arrival was to experience life as a human being.  This being the case, I believe you could argue that sex is an integral part of a human life.  From the perspective of a God experiencing what it is like to be a human, sex would be pretty high on the list of experiences to have in order to understand our species.  I know that the scripture doesn't mention any of this unless you recognize Dan Brown as canon, just a thought concerning the ""he had to experience being wholly human"" angle.",,False,,t5_2ryd5,True,,,True,t3_hti46,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/hti46/did_jesus_christ_produce_physical_waste/,

The argument was well made on both 'sides', that this blustering and rather petty approach puts off a lot of people who might otherwise have a lot to contribute to the debate.

In another thread the Mods asked for feedback on what to do to correct some of these problems, and perhaps attract a higher quality of debate.  So I thought it would be useful to flesh out some of the basics in an area I see lot of people from the Christian benches getting tied up; which gives no real incentive for those in the atheist quarter to take part.  Some similar pointers from the Christian side would of course be very welcome.

**Why Christians carry the burden of proof**

Statement A contains the following:  God is a non-physical entity outside of space-time, who created the physical universe in which we exist.

Statement B contains the following:  God manifested Himself in human form on the planet earth 2013 years ago, so that every living creature in the universe would know that He exists.

Statement C, therefore, MUST contain the following if Christianity is true:  I) A description of the relationship between the truth-claims of A and the truth-claims of B which does not borrow from one in order to explain the other.  II) Objectively valid evidence that God is a non-physical entity outside of space-time capable of creating physical objects which obey the laws of space-time.  III) Objectively valid evidence that God manifested Himself in human form on the planet earth 2013 years ago, so that every living creature in the universe would know that He exists.

**Why the bible doesn't count**

I) It does not meet the burden of proof set out in statement C because the bible is not objectively valid.  II) It makes truth-claims which are directly contradicted by empirical observations.  III) It makes unfalsifiable truth-claims about observations which have not and / or cannot be made.

**Why atheists do not need to meet the burden of proof on your behalf**

I) Atheists do not believe God is a non-physical entity outside of space-time, who created the physical universe in which we exist.  II) Atheists do not believe God manifested Himself in human form on the planet earth 2013 years ago, so that every living creature in the universe would know that He exists.  Therefore III) atheists do not need to present any evidence that God is not a non-physical entity outside of space-time which is not capable of creating physical objects that nevertheless obey the laws of space-time.

**We'll move on when the criteria of statement C has been set out; possible objections**

Until C is presented in a way which is logically valid we cannot go forward.  There are no hypotheticals worth entertaining if they demand that Christians be allowed to sidestep them simply to:

I) Insist that statement C is only relevant if you lack faith in that particular religion.  If this is your get-out-of-jail-free card of choice, please recognise that it is no different than declaring your faith is in faith itself, and therefore does not meet the criteria of **your own burden of proof**, C.

II) Insist that atheists do in fact believe God is a non-physical entity outside of space-time, who created the physical universe in which we exist, but are either in a state of wilful denial, or have succumb in some other way to secondary truth-claims incumbent upon statement B.

III) Insist that the burden of proof does not rest upon such strict absolutes.  If you cannot see the logical necessity of C, that does not mean no-one else can see it either.

[Special Pleading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading), be it direct or indirect, does not exclude your argument from meeting the criteria of statement C.  Statement C is an emergent property of two inescapable fundamentals of the Christian faith itself, NOT an artificially imposed barrier to statement C being shown objectively valid by a third-party.

**Summery**

This argument is not designed to scupper religious objections no-matter-what.  It is, however, an attempt to demonstrate in as simple terms as possible why the burden of proof begins for Christians way before any debate we might have about human behaviour, morality, the origins of life, or the big bang can even begin.

Until it is acknowledged by those who insist otherwise, that they have based their right to make this insistence upon a gamble no atheist would make, no amount of however cleverly constructed escape hatch arguments are going to make any difference to any atheist sure of their [facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact).

That does not mean we cannot have these conversations, and all dialogue should cease; far from it.  But hoping that the burden of proof will go away, if enough of a smokescreen is erected around it that at least a certain percentage of the population continues to believe in things which aren't true, doesn't mean that those of us who see this smokescreen for what it truly is are going to suspend our disbelief for the same reasons Christians suspend theirs.

My problem with this bit of (il)logic is that it is no different from the statement ""John was immortal, but then he died"".

The statement: ""Adam was sinless until he sinned"" is a tautology and is not meaningful, it literally means nothing and carries with it no information that isn't patently obvious per the rules of logic. It's like saying ""this piece of paper is not a paper airplane, until I fold it into one"".

Adam was NOT made perfect, if he were ""perfect"" he would not have sinned, he would have been incapable of being deceived (that's a whole other can of worms too...)

Christians claim that we have an inherently sinful nature (original sin). This means that it is a part of our being that we do not control. Christians also believe that God made humans, so our sinful nature is the result of Gods own design. Christians also believe that God does not like sin.

So God created us with an inherently sinful nature, despite the fact that he does not like sin, so naturally we sin, so he get's mad at us and drowns us all.

Then, he promises to never do that again (implying a regret/mistake).

Then, he sends himself to be sacrificed to himself to appease himself and to forgive us of the sins that we commit due to the inherently sinful nature that he designed us with in the first place.

...make sense yet?

Christians will then try to play the free will card, despite the fact that it's patently obvious that we don't have the type of ""free will"" required for their argument to make sense, but even ignoring that it still makes no sense.

God gave us the ability to sin and the ""free will"" to choose to sin... then he commanded us not to sin, then he murdered us all because we sinned... this seems like starting over after a failed experiment, but a God with omni-properties would not need to experiment.

This is like telling my child: ""You may select the cupcake or the baby carrots for lunch, but DO NOT select the cupcake!"" and then murdering him when he does select the cupcake, and knowing from the beginning that he would select the cupcake. All I did was murder my child for acting according to his nature.

If I didn't want my child to have the choice I shouldn't have given him the choice... unless it were a test to see what he would do, but a being with omni-properties does not need to test anything, he already knows what we are going to do.

But better yet, Jesus actually deserved the death penalty twice over.

Evidence:

First, a little directive from God in Deuteronomy 13:2-6:

&gt;If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises in your midst, and he made a sign or **performed a wonder for you,** and when the sign or wonder came to pass, **he spoke unto you saying ""Let us go after other gods, which you have not known, and serve them,"" you shall not heed the words of that prophet or dreamer of dreams,** for the Lord your God is testing you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul! It is after the Lord your God that you shall walk! And it is Him you shall fear! You shall observe His commandments! And hearken to His voice! And Him shall you serve! And unto Him shall you cleave!

&gt;**And that prophet or dreamer of dreams shall be put to death!** For he has spoken perversion against the Lord your God - Who has taken you out of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of bondage and servitude! - to set you aside from the path that the Lord your God has commanded you to walk upon! So shall you purge the evil from your midst.

So the following conditions must be met for the execution of the dreamer of dreams or the prophet:

1. Must perform a sign or a wonder

2. Must incite people to worship any god other than the Lord himself

Jesus performed miracles and claimed to be divine according to the NT.

This made him a prophet/dreamer who performed miracles and told people to go after ""other gods who they have not known,"" namely him in this case.

As for the second death penalty, Jesus is picking plants on the Sabbath in Luke 6, which is forbidden. Jesus even acknowledges this. Instead of responding with ""It's permitted,"" his response is ""David also broke the law."" And guess what the punishment for violation of the Sabbath is...

I decided to contrast something so bold with the Bible and see what I could find. No disappointment followed:

* **""You're NOTHING without me.""**

Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them. You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people. Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.

Interestingly enough, those patients who *were* prayed for were more likely to develop post surgery complications; the researchers chalked this up to a form of stage fright. 

Do studies like this give you pause to think perhaps no one is listening? Think of the billions of people who engage in prayer on a daily basis, and it is all apparently in vain. If God was not planning on answering any prayer, why do you think the bible specifically asks those to do it (there is a lot if this but the first to come to mind is in Matthew 6:7 I think - I might have this mixed up though), instead of perhaps spending the time actively helping oneself or others?

**Psalm 122:6** Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! May they be secure who love you!

**1 Timothy 2:1-2** First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.

**James 5:13-14** Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.

Basically, no one has any real faith. They can claim to have faith because of a little loophole. 

Basically it's the ""Don't test God"" situation. Claiming to have faith, and being unable to test God go hand in hand. Also believing that God works in ""mysterious"" ways. 

So you can say that you believe God will take care of you, then justify  bad things. You can have faith that God would protect you from anything, justify it when he doesn't, and then, well the examples I had were these. 

No amount of faith, none, can save you from quite a lot of situations. Faith won't help you if you're trapped under water, won't help you if you're cut and bleeding out, won't help you if you're smashed in a hydraulic press... 

It would be beyond easy for God to help someone in these situations. But deep down you know he wouldn't. You could never have enough faith to lock yourself in a tank of water for an hour. You know you would drown no matter what your beliefs are. If someone tied you to a chair and cut your arms, no amount of talking to god could help you. (Sure, someone could come and let you out of the tank or save you from the chair and wrap up your arms, but that isn't supernatural, and can't be attributed to any divine source.)

So yeah. It's just us, there is no supernatural, and when it comes down to it we all know it. 

The power of God is limited to things that could happen naturally, and get attributed to god. 

Ok that's the pitch. You know that faith can't help you in a great number of situations. You also know that there are times when things don't go well, and God gets by on that too. You just slap ""God did it"" on all the good stuff that happened. 

Like if you were tied to a chair and someone saved you you would say that that was God, and be utterly convinced of it. There's nothing supernatural about it though. If you were tied to a chair bleeding out, and all your cuts healed and the chair and ropes disintegrated... That would be supernatural. If you were trapped under water and you could somehow survive in some way for an hour, that's supernatural. If you were pressed under a hydraulic press and you suddenly had diamond hard skin and could withstand the pressure, then that would be supernatural. 

You could actually have faith, and a belief that god would protect you if you really put it all on the line... 

If you dove into a swimming pool filled with needles and razorblades, knowing God would protect you... deep down you know it wouldn't work. You know you would get hurt. That ""Don't test God"" loophole makes it ok. 

TLDR- There are many loopholes like ""mysterious ways"" and ""inability to test God"" that make true faith unnecessary.

Basically if we pass, heaven, if we fail, hell awaits. 

To put it simply, it would work better if we had no knowledge. 

If you tell someone that you're doing an experiment and you're testing whether they're going to follow the rules, they'll act differently, knowing they're being observed. 

Now if you plan for the bias to test something else, like the way people will act when they know they're being watched, then ok, but that's a different test. 

So here is my scenario. Well a few potential ones. 

1. There is no god and it's all just made up. 

What? Oh I have to put another? Ok well...

2. (Again) There is a god and he's doing some sort of double blind test. He wants to see how people act. (He can't care about innate good and evil. If he did he would have just made people, let them live their lives, then act accordingly based on their behavior.)

Ok sorry for the weird formatting I'm mostly asleep just running on fumes. 

Ok so, let's take the hard long stretch and suppose there is a god. Only it's not this universe, it's a different one. 

Basically God makes people and this time he doesn't fuck things up and have to kill everyone. He makes people and does everything correctly. 

He sets everything up, then turns everything on and just watches. 

This is a world where there would be no hint of a god. He never talked to anyone, did any miracles, nothing. He doesn't care if people act wicked, doesn't heal the sick, or anything. He just watches, and observes. He watches people either act horribly, or kindly, and sees most as somewhere in the middle. He doesn't need people to sit around praising him because the test should be whether or not people are generally good or generally bad. 

The whole idea that god needs people to praise and worship him is insane. There's no reason for him to even tell us that he exists. And judging us based on whether or not we believe he exists, without any evidence, on faith, is just about the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. 

So basically all that was the lead up, to get the mind thinking for the real question. 

Why the heck did God tell people he existed and taint the experiment? 

What do you think about the possibility that things aren't as simple as they seem? What if he wants to see if people are smart enough to realize that there isn't actually enough evidence to believe in him. Or some other thing. What if he gets mad at people who claim to know he exists when he deliberate made that impossible? 

If there is a god, I don't see how he could care if we believe in him. That's just an idiotic thing for him to care about. I don't think he cares if we worship him, because that's totally petty on his part. Demanding worship is one of the absolute worst attributes anything can have. Think about the worst king you could think of, and you're picturing a guy getting mad at people who refuse to worship and praise him, and punishing them forever. 

It seems that the test would still be whether or not we were good or not. But he put a monkey wrench in that test. You see the knowledge that we're being tested messes up the results. People want to get to heaven and avoid hell. So it influences the results. Why would god want influenced results, people behaving for the reward or punishment avoidance? 

Something is fishy. Things just can't be as they seem, if he is testing us, it has to be for something else. Not good or evil, not whether or not we believe but that's closer... 

The signs point to either gullibility, or he wants to see how people act with the reward / punishment looming over their heads. He wants influenced impure results. 

Either that or there is no god and it's all made up and makes no sense. 

Sorry this was sort of rambley.

TLDR - If there is a god, he's not looking for what it seems like he is. He's studying something else because he gave people too much info. He tainted his results by letting people know they're being observed, and there's a reward / punishment. Also the faith / gullibility thing.

I am *not* looking to start a flame war. lol.

So I totally get that homosexuality is widely seen as a sin among most christians/christian communities today. I'm not interested in the whole ""well if being gay is forbidden then football, tatoos, and divorce should be as well"" argument. 

What I *am* curious about is why it seems like it is so important to make it illegal. There are a ton of legal [**benefits**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_and_responsibilities_of_marriages_in_the_United_States) for being legally married, and denying these to two people who will be living together, and potentially raising children together, is very detrimental.

Now I understand this reasoning may sound odd, because someone who believes that homosexuality is a sin, and therefore doesn't recognize such a partnership as legitimate, would not want two men or two women to be recognized as legally equal to a heterosexual couple. My father, a devout christian but not a fundamentalist at all, told me that he feels that such recognition would undermine what he and my mother have.

My response to that view is this: how do these feelings justify making such a union illegal? These sentiments are all derived directly from the bible, or from biases instilled in us as children. And you simply cannot, in a true democratic system, legislate based on religion. The church has every right to not actually *marry* the couple, but denying them legal protection in my mind isn't much different from officially denying muslims legal protection (just as an example). [In this speech made by Obama a few years ago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av3H0_7HgSg), he really puts it better than I ever could. He makes some really powerful points here, points that, even from a religious standpoint (and growing up in a very christian home I think I can emulate one) I can't see how you can argue with what he says here. 

There are many defenses of anti-homosexuality I've seen that base themselves on things other than religion. Before I even get into some examples, it seems to me that even views that in no way involve religion almost universally come from those who believe in the bible. I'm not saying this automatically invalidates the opinion, but it does make me wonder if their religious bias is skewing the way they interpret data. 

In my father's case, I can see he is quite jaded against the concept of homosexuality. He had a highschool friend come out as being gay, only to die of HIV a few years later. Another man he met on a religious retreat called Tres Dias (in which he is heavily involved) had his marriage ruined, and was infected with HIV, because of a homosexual affair. He firmly believes that the way ""homosexual intercourse"" works makes it far better at transmitting disease. The research that I've done into the subject it largely conflicting, and it is very difficult to find truly impartial data on the matter. From what I can tell, it is the promiscuity, and not the action itself, that leads to infection (if there *are* some good impartial studies out there I'd love to hear about them). And from that, I would say that promiscuity is a behavior that is entirely independent of sexual orientation. To those that say that the homosexual community emphasizes promiscuity, I would argue that A) that is not the *entire* community, just a small part. there is a culture just like that among the heterosexual. Also I would say that B) even if there *is* more promiscuity, I would attribute that to the amazing amount of discrimination they face; such hate directed at them makes it difficult for many to find and reconcile themselves to a homogenous homosexual relationship, so they instead indulge themselves physically. 

I would think that if you believe homosexual intercourse transmits disease more effectively, you would *want* gay marriage legalized. Marriage encourages intercourse with only one partner, whereas if people can't marry, they will be less likely to remain in a committed relationship, thus resulting in them copulating with more people. If neither spouse has an STI, then it is impossible for one of them to get one inside of that relationship. Even if one of them*is* infected, then marriage increases the likelihood that it won't spread beyond those two people. So, ultimately, short of making gay sex illegal entirely (which is ludicrous), this would be the most favorable alternative.

Another thing I've heard is how gay couples are bad parents, or that they set a bad example for children. This is just kind of ridiculous: the premise for the argument is entirely subjective and anecdotal. This would be like saying that *every* heterosexual family that self-identifies as christian is awesome. It is a generalization that cannot be justified outside of religion. The book *My Two Moms* by Zach Wahls by itself makes this theory seem far fetched. The idea that it ""sets a bad example"" is also subjective: just because you believe homosexuality is bad doesn't mean everyone has to. I also don't buy the whole ""how do I explain homosexuality to my child"" concept. People who struggle with this seem to only identify the sexual aspect of the relationship here. To explain it to a child, I would simply say that ""those two men/women love each other very much, just as much as mommy and daddy love each other.""

Finally there is the ""it is unnatural, marriage is all about making life"" point. This is a view that I can actually respect; at face value it seems to have merit. However it has several flaws that I cannot reconcile with. First, if marriage is all about making new life, why allow heterosexual parents to choose whether or not to have children? I can't think of a reason. Second, contrary to popular belief, [Animals do it too.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals). In fact, most studies show that the number of homosexual sexual encounters in giraffes *far* outstrips the number of heterosexual ones. Finally, how exactly do you *define* ""natural?"" you could easily describe medicating oneself against illness, or better yet treating mental disorders, as ""unnatural.""

Anyway, those are all of the viewpoints that I could think of off the top of my head, along with my responses to them. Is there anywhere I reasoned with fallacy, or was just wrong? Are there any major viewpoints I missed? What do all of you think? I know this is a really lengthy post, but I just wanted to be sure I covered everything I can think of.

**TL;DR:** Defenses I have heard of anti gay sentiment&amp; why I don't buy them (way oversimplified &amp; may sound over exaggerated because I'm trying to be concise. Read the whole thing if you want to make a point or draw conclusions please)* 

---To ""the Bible says so"" or other religiously derived reasons: you can't legislate based solely on religion. [My opinion on this matter expressed perfectly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av3H0_7HgSg)

---To ""gay people are promiscuous!:"" So are straight people. discrimination may well be a cause for some of the promiscuity. Marriage and promiscuity are opposites, so if your issue is with promiscuity, wouldn't you *want* it legalized?

---To ""gay sex is unhealthy/spreads disease:"" cheeseburgers are unhealthy, too. it may indeed be better at spreading disease, however that remains unproven. Even if it is, encouraging homogenous gay relationships would limit disease spread, as ultimately promiscuity is what spreads it, regardless of how well certain types of sex spread it.

---To ""gay people can't raise children/ bad family values/ bad example for the kids:"" Impossible to say that *every* gay couple is bad at parenting, just as many bad heterosexual parents. Read *My Two Moms* by Zach Wahls if you are confused about values. How is two people loving each other and living together, regardless of gender, ""bad"" or difficult to explain to kids? (again, ""bad"" from a nonreligious stance, as you can't legislate based on religion).

---To ""gay relationships are unnatural/ don't produce life:"" There are plenty of heterosexual couples who choose not to produce life either. If its unnatural, why do so many animals do it too (cited in main text). How do you even *define* what is natural and what isn't?

So a woman's life is worth more than a fetus.

&gt; 27:6 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.

&gt; 27:7 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.

As a narrative function, Judas betrays Christianity, revealing it for what it is.",Basilides,29,13,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/mgcmo/judas_didnt_betray_jesus_as_a_narrative_function/,"The question is not, ""why did Judas betray Jesus?"" The question is, ""why did the Sanhedrin need Judas?"" The answer is quite simple: the Sanhedrin did not need Judas.

Jesus could have been arrested any number of times without the general populace knowing about it. It would have been simple to keep tabs on his whereabouts. The religious authorities did not need a betrayal - only the gospel writers needed a betrayal, so that a few more ""prophecies"" could be fulfilled. 

In the earliest Christian writings, the Pauline epistles, Paul does not even mention Judas by name. Of course, Paul also never mentions the Sanhedrin, Herod Antipas, Pontius Pilate or a whole host of characters and episodes from the Jesus biography. In fact, the only episodes Paul mentions are Jesus' birth (""born of woman"" but no Mary and no virgin), the Last Supper, the crucifixion and the resurrection. But I digress.

""For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,"" (1 Corinthians 11:23)

The Greek word translated above as ""betrayed"" is [""paradidomi"" or ""paradidomai""](http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=3860). But in Romans 8:32 and Romans 4:25 the word is translated as ""handed over"" or ""delivered over"". 

Gospel writers constructed episodes of the Jesus story using passages from the Tanakh. Perhaps this is how ""hand over"" turned into ""betrayed"" and an anonymous act or an act of God (handing over) came to be applied to a specific human character (Judas).

Specifically, the author of the gospel of Mark seems to have employed Psalm 41:9 as a means of composing the Last Supper story.

""Even my bosom friend in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted his heel against me."" (Psalm 41:9) 

The author of Matthew fleshes out the Judas character with even more Old Testament passages.

""It is interesting to see how Matthew embellishes the enigmatic figure and fate of Judas. First, he knows the precise amount Judas was paid, 30 silver pieces. He knows this from Zechariah 11:11 (“And they weighed out as my wages thirty shekels of silver.”) How does he know that Judas returned the money, throwing it into the Temple treasury, and that the priests decided to use it to buy the potter’s field? The Syriac version of Zechariah reads: “Then the LORD said to me, ‘Cast it into the treasury, this lordly price at which I was paid off by them. So I took the thirty shekels of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of the LORD.” The Hebrew of the same verse reads: “”Cast it to the potter, etc.” How does Matthew know Judas hanged himself? That was the fate of David’s traitorous counselor Ahithophel (2 Samuel 17:23), whom scribal tradition took to be the subject of Psalm 41:9, which the gospels applied to Judas (Helms, p. 106)."" 

[Robert M. Price, ""New Testament Narrative as Old Testament Midrash.""](http://www.robertmprice.mindvendor.com/art_midrash1.htm)

The ""betrayal"" related by the gospels and pretty much every element of the Judas tale is based on Old Testament scripture or ""messianic prophecy."" The Judas episode is pure fiction.

But why is this fictional character named Judas?

The English word ""Jew"" is derived from the Latin Iudaeus, which, like the Greek Ιουδαίος (Ioudaios), could also mean ""Judaean"". The character is named ""Judas"" simply to indicate that he is a Jew from Judea.

""Spong's conclusion is that early Bible authors, after the First Jewish-Roman War, sought to distance themselves from Rome's enemies. They augmented the Gospels with a story of a disciple, personified in Judas as the Jewish state, who either betrayed or handed-over Jesus to his Roman crucifiers. Spong identifies this augmentation with the origin of modern Anti-Semitism.""

So the New Covenant that Jesus came to fulfill actually involves the *absence* of a book! In the New Testament (King James Version) Paul (ironically?) refers to the New Covenant as the ""New Testament"". And he concurs with Jeremiah 31.

Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; *not of the letter*, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. (2 Corinthians 3:6)

Leave it to these cock-eyed Christians to turn the new covenant into exactly what it is not supposed to be. These Christians don't just turn the new covenant into yet another religion based upon the dry letter of a book....they have the temerity to refer to a book of letters as the New Testament. But the New Testament is supposed to be a book without letters. The New Testament is supposed to be written in the minds and on the hearts of every person...

""...written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone (or on pieces of paper) but on tablets of human hearts."" (2 Corinthians 3:3)

Some hypothetical situations:

1. If someone were to raise a child in a room isolated from society and never expose him to the Bible and Jesus, would that child, upon death, go to Hell?

2. If that child, at age 18, were handed a Bible and given no direction other than ""read this"", would the child go to Hell if he did not believe what was written?

3. If that child were instead given a Bible AND a Torah/Quran/Hindu text (or other), would his afterlife depend on his recognition of the Bible as the ""best"" one?

For clarification: the child is isolated in the sense that he never interacts with media/writings from the outside, and only ever sees his caretaker, who never explains anything regarding religion and keeps education to a minimum. Furthermore, if and when the child recognizes one of the texts as sacred he follows it to the letter.

 Therefore, paintings must be grown. 


 Of course ... no. Natural things grow and artificial things, like paintings, are made. Paintings do require a painter, because they're artificial. That's the definition of artificial. Trees don't require a tree-er though because, well, that's kinda the definition of natural. It's not made. It'd be equally silly for me to say that because paintings require a painter or watches require a watchmaker, that nature must require a creator. 

 But that's just what creationist do all the time. Except they don't call nature nature, they call it creation. Which is a fallacy. To call nature creation implies it has a creator, but the existence of nature is not itself evidence of a creator. You can't ascribe the attributes of artifical things to natural things anymore than you can ascribe the attributes
of natural things to artifical things. 

 Trees grow, so paintings must grow

 and 

 Paintings are made, so trees must be made

 are equally invalid statements. Trees, flowers, and nature ≠ paintings, watches, and creation (not withstanding trees create more trees, people create more people, etc, etc. You know what I mean). The only things we've ever witnessed to be created (again, in the sense I'm using here) are artificial products.

Even though I am an atheist, this debate will be Christianity vs Judaism, with you taking the Christian side.

You must be a creationist, against gay marriage and abortion, and believe that the Old Testament is the literal infallible word of God. You should be fairly well-versed in the New Testament (even googling verses that you can't remember exactly where is fine), as you will probably need to reference it to rebut some of my arguments. I want the infallibility and literalism of scripture to be taken as a given. This is my theology as well, even if I don't believe in it.

I will *not* be attacking your views on origins, political issues, and inerrancy. These will be accepted as givens from both sides of the debate. What I *will* be attacking is the internal consistency of your belief, mostly from a Jewish perspective.

So to sum up the givens that will be accepted before the debate even starts as fact and framework:

* God exists. He is a ~~non-corporeal~~, omniscient, omnipotent, all-loving being that intervenes (whether naturally or supernaturally) on this earth and has a master plan for humanity, which He cares about dearly. Arguments against God like the problem of evil will not be mentioned or used because theistic belief is background for this debate. (Arguments that can be used against a specific religion's understanding of its deity are just fine though.)
* The book which you call the Old Testament and that I call the Torah is the infallible, inerrant, literal word of God as it was given to Moses and the Jews at the Sinai revelation 3300 years ago. The prophets and writings are also authoritative and binding, even if not dictated directly like the Pentateuch was.
* God created the world in six days, and did not use Darwinian evolution to do so. The word ""day"" may not necessarily be a day's length as we know it today. The flood is also literal.
* Judaism was the correct religion at one point in time.
* All the prophecies of the OT are binding
* Jesus existed.

I simply want to know what it is each person thinks.    If you were to sit down and think of what it would take to you to not believe.  
  Would it be that some other God come down and say "" Im the true God, the christian God is fake""   

Would it take the confirmation about the big bang theory and the full on explanation of our natural universe.  That we learned everything there was about the origin of the universe, and can prove that it can have been created naturally, without the assistance of God.

Would it take somehow, someway that we proved that Jesus didnt get resurrected?

Many of these things will not come to pass, it is more likely that scientists will come up with the full on answer for the universe, before we prove jesus wasnt resurrected.  However thats not my point.  Im curious for YOU personally what it would take.  I would like you to sit down and think about it. 

I would like to see some honest answers, and i would appreciate all those coming in to not misconstrue this as me trying to be an asshole.  I simply am curious,  because i am a former christian, and i know that the thing that got the ball rolling for me, was wondering how could the Holy spirit actually be moving through people that the bible defined that it shouldnt be. In particular, my pastor. He was found to be cheating on his wife repeatedly, and using our tithe money to fly his private jet to fly to his on the side woman. However he would still preach that God only answers the prayers of the righteous, and the holy spirit cant move through you, if you arent right with God. He would go through his normal "" spirit-filled"" sessions, meanwhile everyone knew what he was doing.  I couldnt imagine thats, how God would work. Why would God continue to work and do miracles through a man like this. Anyways, thats just MY story.   Many will argue that i may be wrong about making such an argument, but it was what got the ball rolling.  I then moved on to the suffering of the world, the amounts of fallacies in the bible, the philosophy of religions, the history of religion, the misconceptions between all the churches, and a growing list.

Often times, especially on this subreddit, we forget to acknowledge that there are some things we will never understand. An good example is the trinity. How can God be one God, yet have three distinct persons? There are lots of ways theologians have tried to explain or illustrate this. But the reality is, we will probably never fully understand it (whether we'll be able to grasp these concepts with our regenerated minds in heaven is also debated).

Here's the point: God is an infinite being - literally so powerful that he spoke the universe into existence. There are laws of physics that we are just beginning to understand, and God is the author and designer of those laws. Doesn't it only make sense that created beings with finite minds are simply not capable of understanding the infinite mind of God?

This doesn't mean that we quit trying. I believe that our struggle to understand the more mysterious qualities of God brings us closer to Him. I am by no means trying to stifle inquiry and debate. These things help us to grow. However, we should be humble enough to, at times, say that there are some things revealed to us (in the bible, or nature) that we will never fully grasp.

For example, in the ""dying god"" motif of the resurrection, the classics scholar is reminded of the life of Apollonius of Tyana. This first-century miracle worker had a life that shared many features with that of the Jesus of the Gospels. Of course, the actual life of Apollonius was not written until after the Gospels, so scholars cannot be sure that Christianity did not influence it. However, if we were to accept the ""life"" as being an accurate account of what pagans believed about Apollonius in the first century, we have a good parallel to Jesus. At the very least, however, the mystery religions of Greece and Rome had important similarities to many features of the Christian cult, including the dying god motif. Using the radical infection method of dealing with the text, it would be permissible to call the entire ""Jesus story"" a Greek importation.""

http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles4/ReynoldsAthensJerusalem.php

Of course this Christian scholar goes on to say, ""Pay no attention to the parallels. Nothing to see here, folks. It's all just a total coincidence.""

More specifically, the Gentiles gave to the Hellenized Jews who came to be known as Christians the following:

A son fathered of a god and a mortal woman (Prometheus, Hercules, Perseus, Adonis aka Tammuz) born of a virgin (Perseus) who performed healings (Asclepius), fantastic feats (Hercules), was scoffed at yet pursued what is right and honorable despite knowing that it would result in his own early death (Achilles), made a great sacrifice for the benefit of mankind (Prometheus), descended into Hell to rescue lost souls (Hercules) and ascended into Heaven (Hercules).

And the great Hellenistic thinker, Plato, composed a tale that has epitomized the best of Hellenistic values and Western values since. His allegory of the cave tells us how a would-be savior of a people will do all he can out of compassion to rescue others. But at the same time those he loves and would save will not recognize him or his claims. They will even scoff at him, and even eventually seek to kill him if they ever have the chance.

Remember, there are no parallels to any of these concepts in the Old Testament.

Other borrowings from Hellenism:

The Trinity, a divine virgin, the motif of the women who follow the god (Dionysus), the Platonic mind-body dualism of Paul, the Logos, the red dragon chasing the woman with child in the Book of Revelation, the millenium and the lake of fire.

The list goes on and on.

Even the idea of overturning an old religion by re-imagining an old myth comes from Hellenism...

There were two Prometheus myths. Hesiod wrote an early version of the myth (which we might refer to as the ""Old Testament"" myth of Prometheus) wherein Zeus was the good guy and Prometheus was the bad guy. But in the 5th century BC, Greek playwright, Aeschylus, composed Prometheus Bound, the Greek antecedent to the Pauline idea that mankind had been cursed by the father of the god. In Aeschylus' telling of the story, Hesiod's earlier version was inverted. Similarly, Christianity is an inversion of the original Yahweh myth.

""These innovations reflect the play's thematic reversal of the Hesiodic myth. In Hesiod, the story of Prometheus (and, by extension, of Pandora) serves to reinforce the theodicy of Zeus: he is a *wise and just* ruler of the universe, while Prometheus *is to blame for humanity's unenviable existence*. In Prometheus Bound, this dynamic is transposed: Prometheus *becomes the benefactor of humanity*, while every character in the drama (except for Hermes, a virtual stand-in for Zeus) decries the Olympian as a cruel, vicious tyrant.""

&gt;And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.

&gt;Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.

&gt;Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.

&gt;That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

&gt;And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?

IMHO, this describes a very admirable way of life. Be egregiously, unreasonably nice to people, even when they're not being nice to you. Good stuff. 

And you'll note that nowhere in all that is there talk of atonement or repentance or forgiveness. You don't demand a blood sacrifice in order to turn the other cheek; you just *do it*. You don't demand that your enemies repent and beg forgiveness before you love them; you just *do it*. You don't wait to see them sufficiently punished, for their trespasses against you, and you don't ask who they are - you just love, care and forgive, unconditionally. They don't have to accept you as their personal anything, you don't have to be satisfied with their attitude; they don't have to be the right kind of people or headed down the right road. They don't even have to like you. There's  nothing they have to do *at all*. There's nothing *you* have to do. Being compassionate and loving is the right thing to do *at every single instant, no matter what*. 


So why, pray tell, can't an infinitely-good god be as compassionate and loving as he expects mere humans to be?

Why couldn't he have taken a leaf out of HIS OWN DAMN BOOK, LITERALLY, turned around and said ""Ehh, it's just an apple. I've got lots. Here, try one with some sharp cheese; they're *really* good that way""?

My family is Catholic, my sister is Baptist, my wife's family is protestant and I have many theist friends of different denominations. 
Whenever someone catches wind that I am an atheist I sometimes get people trying to explain the Bible or the faith to me in a well meaning (but ultimately futile) effort to help me ""see the light."" 

This has happened so often that I have noticed that everyone I talk to has a different take on it. Literally, I am not exaggerating when I say that every time I hear about it, its different. By that, I don't mean a different slice of the pie that adds to a whole--- I mean a different interpretation and belief system all together, a whole different recipe to whats supposed to be the same pie if you will. 

For example, I hear Jesus was the son of God, but not God himself. On the other hand I hear Jesus is the son of God but also God himself since Jesus is  but one element of the Trinity that is God. The interpretations of the Bible span the gambit so wide its not even funny. The only constant I hear ""they're wrong, this is how it really is.""

Why, even within the same denomination, is the story completely different every time I hear it from someone else? 

How am I supposed to ignore reason, logic, and overwhelming evidence to the contrary from multiple scientific fields in favor of this one particular religion and its holy book when I can't even get a straight answer as to what its all about? Why the variety? Its the infallible will of God and the absolute truth in the universe. Why isn't there a single consensus on what its all about?

The Kansas House on Wednesday [advanced legislation](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2012/mar/28/house-gives-preliminary-ok-bill-supporters-say-pre/) that would allow a religious defense to discriminate against gays.

&gt;State Rep. Lance Kinzer, R-Olathe, defended his bill, saying it was meant to make sure government could not infringe on an individual’s religious beliefs.

&gt;“Free exercise of religion is at the core of who we are as a people,” Kinzer said.

&gt;Davis asked Kinzer if under Kinzer’s bill an apartment owner could cite his religious beliefs to fight a complaint if he refused to rent to a same-sex couple.

&gt;“That is generally correct,” Kinzer said.

This is wrong, full stop.  It is in no way religious discrimination to not give people the right to discriminate against other groups; no one has the right to act in a discriminatory manner, and I'm not sure why any moral person would *want* that right.

The bill was approved 89-27.  This is not a small margin.  This means that the majority of voters in Kansas elected representatives who support a religious exemption to anti-discrimination ordinances.  Most people in Kansas are in favor of representatives that are willing to argue for *carte blanche* to mistreat others.  This does not support the claim that ""moderate"", ""liberal"" believers are the majority; it appears, rather, that at least in Kansas, extremists are the majority.  And I'm not aware that there's anything special about Kansas.

There is no valid justification for this bill.  No one would even suggest it, if it were not for the fervent belief that god cares what people do with their naughty bits.  This is a religiously-motivated bill, and it is explicitly in support of religiously-motivated discrimination against a minority group.  You may say ""that's not what I believe"", but that is not a defense; significant numbers of people *do* believe it, and they believe it for *the same reasons* that you hold your beliefs.  It is quite clear that religion enables and empowers immoral actions.

1332347684.0,18,self.DebateAChristian,r6x8h,"""Forgive those who trespass against us.""",Basilides,27,9,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/r6x8h/forgive_those_who_trespass_against_us/,"According to the author of the Lord's Prayer, the Christian god wants us to forgive those who trespass against us.

That's a little ironic. 

The Christian god blew his first opportunity to forgive others and instead invented the *grudge* against others as a shining example of how *not* to be.

When Adam and Eve committed the absolutely horrible crime of failing to heed the advice of the Christian god, not only did the Christian god refuse to forgive them, the Christian god vowed to retaliate against the entire human race. And, despite the Son coming to earth and sacrificing himself in the futile attempt to undo the damage done by the Father, to this very day the Father continues to retaliate against the entire human race. I can only conclude that Jesus' father has a huge ego.

Jesus directed The Lord's Prayer to his egotistical Father. But how can we reasonably expect the god of the grudge to forgive those who trespass against us? He would not forgive the first trespass and for 4,000 years he would not forgive human beings for something they did not do. Now he supposedly forgives those who believe he came to earth to die at the hands of those he tormented.

If Jesus was God, he came to pay for his own sins.

Are we ready to forgive the Christian god for his refusal to forgive Adam and Eve? Are we ready to forgive the Christian god for retaliating against billions of people who did not eat the fruit in the Garden? Are we ready to forgive the Christian god for the following trespasses against us?

1) Inadequately preparing Adam and Eve for the temptation of the serpent

2) Withholding from Adam and Eve some of the consequences of eating the fruit

3) Allowing the evil serpent into his perfect paradise

4) Punishing two people who could not know they were committing a sin.

5) Cursing all women with pain in childbirth and second class citizenship because a metaphorical woman listened to a metaphorical serpent and ate a metaphorical fruit

6) Cursing all people who would ever be born with death because of a single metaphorical act committed by two metaphorical people. Under this curse, the Christian god stands by and watches the death of every innocent child. The Christian god considers the death and suffering of every innocent child stricken with cancer to be justice.

7) Cursing all people who would ever be born with a sinful nature because of a single metaphorical act committed by two metaphorical people. The Christian god causes you to have sinful thoughts and then blames you for the thoughts he causes (Romans 7:8 and 14-24). The Christian god calls this justice.

8) Drowning every infant and child on earth.

9) Destroying the unified language of the human race to cause discord among us.

10) Lying to Abraham by going back on His word to give the promised land to Abraham's descendants (Genesis 15:17-20). Christians say that the Christian god demanded a perfect sacrifice to satisfy his sense of justice, to somehow not ""go back on His word"". But the Christian god went back on his word to Abraham. He has been betraying Abraham for the last 2,000 years. The Christian god goes back on his word, changes his mind and changes the rules at will. Why, therefore, should we believe the crucifixion was necessary? Why should we believe the Christian god's entire 6,000 year process (game) of justice is necessary?

11) Ordering the Children of Israel to commit genocide.

12) Condoning slavery and rape.

13) Punishing the Jews in general for the actions of the few Jews who participated in the execution of Jesus many years earlier. Under Christianity, the killing of Jesus became the new Original Sin and the Jews became the historic scapegoats for the commission of this sin. A Christian on reddit recently informed me that even the Holocaust was God's will. And I need the forgiveness of this monster?

Maybe the Christian god knew *not* what he did...until 1 AD when He gave birth to a new idea? The idea of forgiveness symbolized by Jesus. But, the Father continues to curse all of us to this day. And the Son seeks forgiveness. The Son is the Father's new idea. The Father's new improved consciousness. But the Father still thinks in his old primitive way.

There's a war in heaven all right. It's a war between the primitive Christian god of wrath and the new improved Christian god of love. It's a war between the divided loyalties of God. Selfishness vs. Unselfishness. The same inner struggle we all experience every day.

""God created mankind in his own image.""

**TL;DR** The Kingdom is within. The Father is within and the Son is within. The metaphorical sins of God the Father represent my sins. When I can forgive and accept myself, I can forgive and accept others.

Hopefully, the Son (the new consciousness) within each one of us will someday be able to transcend the Father (the lack of consciousness) within each one of us. Hopefully, someday the eye of God will be single - meaning God will not be divided against himself. Like Adam and Eve before the Fall, may we and God someday have one perspective and not two. On that day will not see God as a god of wrath *and* a god of love because we will not see ourselves as divided against others. And God will not see himself as divided against us. Hopefully, someday the body of the Christian god will not be full of darkness.

""The light of the body is the eye: therefore *when thine eye is single*, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness."" (Luke 11:34)

""At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."" (Matthew 11:25)


And he said: “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."" (Matthew 18:3)

She had, simply put, lived up to a point where her brain simply said ""no more"", and instead of taking in new impressions and memories switched itself to read-only. Every 90 seconds, she would ""reboot"" and proceed to say and do the exact same things, in the same way and the same order, as the previous cycle.

So, my question now is: do we truly have free will, if a syndrome like this exists?

Her symptoms indicate, to me, that we are after all purely materialistic. If we remove the capacity to make new memories or learn anything from outside stimuli, it takes the form of our brain always following the same pattern, as if all it was was the sum of its parts, and since the parts remain the same, the outcome must do so as well. It would seem to me that if we truly had free will, a state like this wouldn't have the impact it evidently has. With actual Free Will, even though we cannot make new memories, it shouldn't follow that our will remain the same each cycle. We should be able to choose to say anything we wished, regardless of our brain's frozen state, and not be victims to our past.

How does God potentially change this? If you accept this as a valid syndrome, what role does it play in a Godly universe? How did God design free will around this affliction?

“I baptize you with water **for repentance**. (Matthew 3:11) 

Why did Jesus insist upon being baptized by John the Baptist?

Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this **to fulfill all righteousness**.” Then John consented. (Matthew 3:15)

Baptism was not a requirement of the Mosaic law so, in the above verse, Jesus could not have been referring to ""fulfilling"" the law. 

And John the Baptist said he only baptized people ""for repentance"".

So it would seem that Jesus of Nazareth was undergoing baptism for repentance of his own sins.

 16 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. 17 And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.” (Matthew 3;16-17)

I guess that's what happens when you repent of your sins. You become a child of God.

If Jesus was, as Paul maintained, an ""unblemished"" sacrifice it was only because his ""blemishes"" (sins) were forgiven at his baptism.

It seems fairly common (at least on this board) for Christians and other theists to answer the problem of evil by claiming that god does not prevent people from performing evil acts because to do so would require him to violate the evildoer's free will, which for whatever reason he is unable or unwilling to do.


Here's my problem, for those who advocate a form of this:


Let's suppose god had made it impossible for us to murder another human being^1 . If you advocate the above argument, you hold that he would have been violating our free will in doing so.


Here's the thing, though: there are many things which are made impossible for us by the very nature of our existence: we can't turn invisible, or move things with our mind, or create a universe. And if god created the universe and its parameters, then he is at least passively preventing us from doing those things. 


Does it also constitute a violation of our free will that he does so?


If not, why not? In what way does the act of, say, telekinesis differ from murder such that god is free to prevent it or make it impossible without violating our free will?


If so, then why is god willing to go against our free will in some cases, but not others? Where, precisely, is the line between those acts god is willing to violate our free will to prevent and those he isn't, and what criteria does he use to place that line where he does?

The famous 'conversion' of Paul is a good
example. In Acts, it is said that Paul hears the voice of Jesus say:

""Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you, this kicking
against the goads [pros kentra laktizein]"" (Acts 26:15).

In the Bacchae, which is approximately five hundred years older than Acts, the situation is parallel. Dionysus, the persected God, says to King Pentheus, his persecutor:

""You disregard my words of warning... and kick against the goads [pros kentra laktizoimi]"" (line 794).

It is highly probable that 'Luke' has 'borrowed' this from the Bacchae,
because 'Luke' retains the plural form of the noun 'kentra,' which, while
maintaining the meter in the Bacchae, seems out of place in Acts.

'Luke' also apparently plagiarized the Bacchae when constructing the
jail-break scenes of Peter and Paul. When Peter is imprisoned in Jerusalem, an angel appears, saying:

""Quick! Get up... And the chains fell away from his wrists. [When they
approach the prison gate, it] opened for them of its own accord"" (Acts
12:8,10).

Similarly, when Paul and Silas are imprisoned in Phillipi, ""all the doors
burst open and all the prisoners found their fetters unfastened"" (Acts
16:26).

Both scenarios seem to be derived from the Bacchae, where the persecuted Maenads [followers of Dionysus] find that ""The chains on their legs snap apart ...untouched by any human hand, the doors swing wide, opening of their own accord"" (lines 447-8).

Randel Helms observes that ""it really is not surprising that this play
should have had such a lasting effect on Luke's imagination; for it concerns a young, persecuted and misunderstood deity, the son of Zeus and a mortal woman (Semele)..."" (Who Wrote the Gospels, 91).

When I watch this it seems absolutely ridiculous. It seems like these people are just hyping themselves up into some kind of group euphoria and just letting it all out. When I see this it doesn't look like something divinely inspired. I have had friends who do this kind of stuff but for the sake of our friendship I didn't want to ask questions which could be seen as offensive and disrespectful. That's where you lovely people come in:

1. As I understood it speaking in tongues refers to the language used by the apostles so they could spread the word of Jesus to all peoples even if they didn't speak Aramaic. If this is the case why do I have no idea what these people are saying? and are any explanations for this founded in scripture?

2. For Christians who don't do this (which I'm sure are many), what are your thoughts on this? Do you think the holy spirit really works in this way?

3. How do you know that this experience people are having isn't inspired by satan? How do you distinguish an experience inspired by God from an experience inspired by anything else, or even just an experience in your head?


For any of you who do do this, please explain what speaking in tongues means to you.

Please discuss. ,,18,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/gmzrz/atheism_and_justice_my_thoughts_please_discuss/,"“The cruelty of atheism is hard to believe when man has no faith in the reward of good or the punishment of evil. There is no reason to be human. There is no restraint from the depths of evil which is man. The Communist tortures often said, “There is no God, no hereafter, and no punishment for evil. We can do what we wish.” I have even heard one torturer say, “Thank God, in whom I do not believe, that I have lived in this hour when I can express all the evil in my heart.” He expressed it in unbelievable brutality and torture inflicted against his prisoners.”

Richard Wurmbrand

One often hears such examples brought up by Christians. If there is no God, then there is no ultimate justice. Man need not fear evil if he can get away with it since he will not be ultimately punished for his actions. A world lacking ultimate justice is a cruel and heartless one where nothing is guaranteed to prevent evil from triumphing.

The Christian I think has a point, a disbelief in God may have a demoralizing effect on people. It may cause evil people, who were before restrained by the fear of God, to do evil acts as they no longer fear punishment for their actions. However, is it also not true that theism can have a similarly demoralizing effect? Consider the massacre of Beziers in 1209 C.E. Catholic crusaders slaughtered every single inhabitant of the city during the Albigensian Crusade which was launched by pope Innocent in 1208. This crusade was directed at the Cathars of Southern France. Yet, the crusaders viciously and deliberately put the entire city to the sword. Man, women, or child. Catholic or Cathar. It made no difference to the invading army. A passage from the historian Joseph Sumption gives the chilling reasons for the indiscriminate behavior of the attackers.

“A German monk repeated a story that Arnald-Amaury, when asked in the middle of the slaughter how the Catholics could be distinguished from the heretics, replied “Kill them all; God will recognize his own”; and this motto has passed into history as the epitome of the spirit which had brought the crusades to the south.”

We have seen a case where atheism inspired horrendous behavior; here theism- specifically the divine guarantee of justice- has done the same. This massacre was justified by the belief (a correct one, on the Christian view of things) that God would punish or reward each soul as was appropriate. If justice cannot be had on earth, a believer can find recourse by putting the matter into the hands of God.

Atheists have no such recourse. The universe is only as good as we make it. There is no God, no all knowing judge to whom we can send the difficult cases, no guarantee of justice. This realization, rather than being demoralizing, should be remoralizing. There is a greater sense of urgency to obtain justice in this life if it is the only one. It should make us uncomfortable with the taking of human life for any reason. On the other hand, a divine guarantee of justice can make us careless. It can make us more willing to use capital punishment, to send soldiers off to war, and, in cases such as the Crusades, to slaughter innocents. Were George W. Bush an atheist, perhaps he would not have had the confidence to assert that God had told him to invade Iraq. Perhaps Atheism can lead to horrendous actions, but can anyone doubt that Theism can and has done the same?

Next, I have something to say about the topic of self sacrifice. On a theistic world view it is impossible for you to receive a fate better, or worse than that which you deserve. In such a universe, no matter what you do to another person, you cannot, in any way, have an effect on their ultimate fate. Even the brutal murder of someone cannot impose an underserved fate onto someone else; all the killer has done is to deliver them into the hands of a perfect judge. If we consider self sacrifice, we rightly admire those who give their lives up for another or for a noble cause. But on theism, what have they really sacrificed? A martyr made the huge sacrifice of a few years on earth for an eternity of bliss. Consider a mother who throws herself in front of gunfire to save her child. On theism, it is impossible that she has really sacrificed anything, and she has not really saved her child from a fate worse than the one he deserved. For if theism is true, divine justice balances all. This is not to say that here actions are not morally extraordinary, or that we should not view her as an exemplary human being. Rather, it only shows that there is even more to admire in a person who faces death, knowing it to be the end. A person who accepts a fate worse than they deserve for the sake of another is the epitome of self sacrifice.

I end with a quote from the great Bertrand Russell,” Supposing you got a crate of oranges that you opened, and you found all the top layer of oranges bad, you would not argue, ""The underneath ones must be good, so as to redress the balance."" You would say, ""Probably the whole lot is a bad consignment""; and that is really what a scientific person would argue about the universe” We will not produce good fruit by hoping the bottom of the crate is good. Rather, we must return to the fields and get our hands dirty. The universe will only be as good as we make it.",,False,,t5_2ryd5,False,,,True,t3_gmzrz,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/gmzrz/atheism_and_justice_my_thoughts_please_discuss/,

1368111535.0,13,self.DebateAChristian,1e05dh,Why I don't like it when the origin of morality is credited to anywhere else but humans,travis_s,19,6,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/1e05dh/why_i_dont_like_it_when_the_origin_of_morality_is/,"**TL;DR acknowledgment**: The overall point I make below is that denying ourselves the creation of our own morality is extremely self-deprecating. It robs us of the one thing that makes us truly human. 

An opening question that I get when I tell anybody that I'm a non-believer is usually something along the lines of: ""Well, where did our morality come from?"" I know this topic has probably been pounded out dozens of times on this sub, but one more round couldn't hurt, right?

I guess for starters I can acknowledge the fact that this is a losing debate because if you are a Christian then of course your answer to this is that God is the source of our morality (God created everything, thus He created morality). And from the Christian worldview, that's a perfectly sound line of reasoning. I'm not here to say that that's a poor stance on this, I just want to offer up yet another non-believer's view on the subject.

As an atheist, there is only one answer to the question, and it is an extremely satisfying and humbling one. I of course believe that humans are the creators of our own morality. I think it is deeply self-deprecating for us to insist that we did not come up with the principles of right and wrong on our own; that this had to have come from an all-intelligent being. To deny ourselves that reality is to knock our species down a few pegs on the tree of life. I mean, that's what makes us human, right? And to a Christian you feel the same way: yes our morality is what makes us human, for it is the gift endowed upon us by our creator. That's fine, but as a non-believer it frustrates me to no-end to hear that we can't acknowledge.

I'm not going to sit here and say that morality is a delusion; that it is subjective. But it is *evolving*. It is something we've been trying to reach a consensus on since the dawn of society. Can we all acknowledge the fact that slavery is a universal crime against humanity? We do now, but it wasn't that long ago that slavery was an accepted practice (yes it is still happening today, don't retort with that as if it somehow negates the overall point I'm trying to make). 

A lot of Christians assume that if morality didn't come from God then it wouldn't exist at all; that there would be nothing stopping us from wreaking absolute havoc on ourselves with no consequence. Again, how self-deprecating is that? If you really step back and consider that being a good person could easily be paralleled as being a selfish person, then morality starts to make more sense. And the word ""selfish"" has such a negative connotation, but it doesn't have to. When I do good things, it makes me feel good. It's as simple as that. And sure, doing bad things can also make me feel good, but doing bad things will eventually have negative consequences. We do good things because good things often happen to us in return (by and large). We do good things because it helps us survive as a species. 

That's my rant for the morning. It is probably a largely incoherent group of ramblings that may or may not form a succinct message, but 'tis the nature of my brain. As Pascal once said, ""I made this so long because I did not have time to make it shorter.""

There are several problems with this, but the one I want to focus on here is that ""stuff"" does not require a cause.

What is nothing? It is nothing... simple but profound if you understand what I am getting at with that statement. Nothing cannot exist, it is a concept, a mere idea. We have never experienced nothingness, we have never found a volume which contained literally nothing. ""Empty"" space is not empty, it is very much full. We see it as empty because our five senses do not detect anything, but ""something"" is there, not ""nothing"". Electromagnetic fields, specifically. The space between the sun and the Earth may appear empty but it is completely flooded, inundated, with EM radiation with a near infinite number of wavelengths. Visible light travels through space to reach Earth, that is why we can see the sun, and the reflections of that light is why we can see anything else. Beyond that you have thermal radiation, x-rays, gamma rays, etc etc... all forms of EM radiation of specific wavelength regions, all completely filling the vacuum of space. Beyond that, space itself is something, even if you somehow extract all radiation energy, there is still something. If you could remove all energy and matter from the entire universe and place yourself in the middle of this ""empty"" volume you would still be able to tell if you were spinning or not... your arms would still be pulled away from your sides if you were spinning... there has to be a reference frame, there has to be something that you are spinning in relation to. We don't know what this is, we refer to it with terms like the ""fabric of spacetime"" but we really don't understand it, but is there, it exists... even absent of all matter and energy space is still something, it is not nothing.

Furthermore, we've never experienced the creation or destruction of anything. The laws of thermodynamics state that this is not possible. Conservation of matter/energy (same thing per E=mc^2 ) implies that everything that exists has and always will exist, because we lack observational evidence of it's creation or destruction, only of it's conservation.

The point I am making is that we have no evidence, no reason to believe, that there could ever exist an area (or more specifically a volume) where there is literally nothing.

Existence is the default state, the expected state, and it requires no explanation. Given the evidence we have existence is necessary, because we have no evidence that the opposite is even possible. Nothingness would require an explanation, not somethingness.

For example, if you were born in Asia, 200 years ago, you would most likely be a Buddhist, taoist, and or follower of cunfucian ideology. Likewise, if you were recently born in Pakistan, you would likely be a follower of the Muslim faith.  If you were born 3000 years ago, in any place on the globe you would be a follower of a god that has since been cast aside as mythology, and more interestingly, would definitely not be a christian.

We get both stories from the same book.  Why do you accept one and reject the other?

I assume it is because you feel science has proven the Genesis account incorrect, right?  But.. science has also proven that a virgin cannot give birth and people cannot rise from the dead, right?  

I think if we reinterpret the Bible everytime science says we should, that is extremly dangerous!  Why don't we reinterpret the science?  Whose authority do we as Christians truly hold to - man's word or God's word?

I realize that people do not want to appear unintelligent, but is that a Biblical idea?  Are we supposed to crave acceptance from the world?  I also believe creation can be 100% defended, but once we comprimise the Bible - we no longer have a foundation to defend our beliefs.

I think most Christians have not taken the time to think through this issue and why it is so important.  Let me give you a few quick thoughts...

* According to the Bible the earth was made BEFORE the sun (no big bang)
* According to the Bible flying creatures came BEFORE land animals (no evolution)
* According to the Bible man came from dust, and woman from his side (no evolution)
* According to the Bible death entered the world once man sinned (no billions of years of death and reproduction before mankind ""evolved"")
* According to God's own hand in the 10 commandments: ""For in six days God created the heavens and the earth"" (why we celebrate a Sabbath)
* According to the Bible the earth was created out of water (not molten rock)
* According to the Bible death is an intruder on the created order (not the mechanism by which God uses to create; if this were to be so that would make God the creator of all death and suffering)
* According to the Bible thorns came AFTER man sinned (but according to secular interpretations thorns are in the fossil record BEFORE man ""evolved"")
* According to the Bible there was a worldwide flood (but this couldn't have happened if evolution was true because it would have wiped away all the fossil record, BUT funny thing is I think it is actually what created the fossil record!)

This is just the start!  There are sooooo many scriptures you can't explain if you accept evolution.  Why did God need to send his son as our savior, to overcome death, if death was always a part of His plan?  You see death HAS to be an intruder on the created order, our choice to separate ourself from God - for the gospel message to work.  Evolution destroys that cause/effect relationship.

I'm not asking anyone to ignore any evidence.  But just to realign our starting assumptions when we come to the evidence.  When we start with the word of God as our authority, and then interpret the evidence, it all aligns perfectly... and of course it does.  There is NO NEED to reinterpret Genesis, or any of it.",,False,,t5_2ryd5,False,,,True,t3_vbrp1,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/vbrp1/to_my_fellow_christians_who_accept_evolution_why/,

&gt;Matthew 19:16-21

&gt;English Standard Version (ESV)
&gt;The Rich Young Man

&gt;16  And behold, a man came up to him, saying, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?” 17 And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. **If you would enter life, keep the commandments.”** 18 He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, 19 Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” 20 The young man said to him, “All these I have kept. What do I still lack?” 21 Jesus said to him, “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”

With Romans 10:8-10;

&gt;Romans 10:8-10

&gt;English Standard Version (ESV)

&gt;8 But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); 9 because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.

Why does Paul teach a different requirement for salvation that Jesus?  When I first became a Christian, I was told that I had to repent of my sins and accept Jesus into my heart, which I did.  I prayed the ""sinner's prayer"" and accepted Jesus and for 24 years I was a Christian.  However, even as a Christian, when I read the Gospels (with the obvious exception of John), I noticed that Jesus heavily preached the Law.  Jesus even said that he did not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfil it (Matthew 5:17).

Whenever I ask Christians I know about the blatant discrepancy between what Paul taught on salvation and what Jesus himself was alleged to have said, I get increasingly absurd answers.  One such answer is that Jesus upheld the Law (and taught it) while he was alive, but after his death there was no need to obey the Law.  This is silly because Jesus himself predicted his death.  And if Jesus knew the Law was going to be abolished as a result of his death, why did he bother preaching it?  Why didn't Jesus directly say to the rich young ruler that he (the rich man) only needed to believe in Jesus in order to be saved?  

Another excuse I've heard from my Christian family members is that the disciples couldn't bear the knowledge that the Law was going to be abolished.  This is probably taken from John 16:12-13;

&gt;John 16:12-13

&gt;English Standard Version (ESV)

&gt;12 “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. 13 When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.

But if Jesus meant by this that they couldn't bear the knowledge that the Law was going to be abolished, then Jesus was basically lying when he said to the rich young ruler that he needed to keep the commandments in order to be saved, because this is flatly not true.  

Furthermore, both Paul **and** Jesus cannot be right.  Paul says this;

&gt;Galatians 2:16

&gt;English Standard Version (ESV)

&gt;16 yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.

So either Jesus is right and Paul is wrong, or vice versa.  

Also, something occurred to me a few nights ago.  Christian tradition states that Paul died at the command of Nero in 62CE.  Bible scholars believe that Mark, the first Gospel, was written sometime between 65CE and 70CE.  So basically, Paul didn't have access to the Gospels that we read now.  He had never read them.  Given that Paul's ""Gospel"" is actually different from what Jesus taught in the Gospels, it is highly likely that if Paul had known of them he would have written against them.

I'm not really looking to stir up a huge debate on the matter, but this is something I've been curious about for a while now. I've heard this said a lot, and I've always wondered where it came from. I'm not too familiar with the Bible, and the only verses I've heard that seem to relate to this are [Matthew 5:17-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A17-20&amp;version=NIV).

Assuming the Old Testament is covered by ""the Law"" that is written about here, this seems to very clearly state that Jesus himself supports the Old Testament and every commandment therein. If that's wrong, what is he talking about when he says ""the Law""? And what alternative verses lead people to believe that the commandments in the Old Testament can be disregarded?

1. If the biblical portrayals of slavery are accurate, then god explicitly endorsed slavery.
2. A morally perfect being would never endorse an immoral act/practice.

These two guarantee that at least one of the following statements is true:

* The bible's portrayals of slavery^1 are inaccurate.
* God is not morally perfect.
* Slavery^2 is not immoral.

^1 There are two distinct treatments given to slavery in the OT. One describes proper treatment and rights held by Hebrew 'slaves' owned by Hebrews. This version is something like indentured servitude, and is roughly analogous to a contract job in a mildly oppressive society. The other version describes proper treatment and rights held by *gentile* slaves owned by Hebrews. This version is only *slightly* less brutal/barbaric than the form of slavery practiced in the 19th century American South. I have no interest in engaging those who are unfamiliar with these distinctions, and it is my hope to avoid arguments over the *content* of the practice of slavery. I leave open the question as to whether or not it is immoral, but the text is clear in that gentile slaves are actual slaves, and are actually subjected to pretty harsh conditions.

^2 Note I am using the term ""slavery"" to denote ""the form of slavery portrayed in the bible.""

I hope to see some significant discussion on the subject, and I especially look forward to hearing which of the three Christians deny: the veracity of the bible, the moral character of god, or the immorality of slavery.

Informal summary:

* Either the bible is accurate or it isn't [with respect to slavery].
* If it's accurate, then god explicitly endorsed slavery.
* But morally perfect beings don't endorse immoral behavior.
* So if the bible is accurate, than either slavery isn't immoral (because it was endorsed), or god isn't morally perfect (because he endorsed slavery).
* This means that at least one of the following is true:

1. The bible is inaccurate [with respect to slavery].
2. God is not morally perfect.
3. Slavery is not immoral.

You cannot choose what you believe in. For instance, if I asked you to believe a fire-proof cow lives inside the sun, you couldn't do it. There is no switch you can flip in your brain and all of a sudden you believe it.

Now, you can *say* you believe it. But that would be a lie, not legitimate belief. You cannot make yourself convinced that a cow lives inside the sun through sheer willpower. Something would have to happen. A probe near the sun would need to record a faint ""moo"" sound or a scan of the sun would need to show a cow-shaped shadow near the center. Something has to happen to spark the belief, you cannot conjure genuine belief out of thin air.

I hope everyone can understand and accept this, because if you do than it opens up a lot more questions that yield good debates. Example:

- I am convinced there is no god  
- I have done all I can to research god and try to convince myself he exists (reading bible, going to church, etc)  
- I remain unconvinced a god exists  
- Because I cannot choose to believe in him, and have exhausted all methods available to try to believe in him, I will never believe in him  
- God is supposed to love me and wants me to be in heaven  
- God created me knowing I would not be able to believe in him

1331868779.0,15,self.DebateAChristian,qyvqr,Why isn't abortion discussed in the Bible?,richunclesam,17,2,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/qyvqr/why_isnt_abortion_discussed_in_the_bible/,"As stated.  

I recently learned that abortion is *not* a novel idea or practice.  It predates Christianity in several cultures.  It would have been a known ""issue"" to both Luke (who, as a physician, would have been familiar with the writings of Hippocrates) and Paul (who, as a cosmopolitan Roman, would have seen the practice or at least heard of it).  

The Torah seems to deal with just about every aspect of life.  It specifies how fabrics should be woven and what ingredients should not be eaten together.  So it seems conspicuous that abortion does not merit a specific mention.  There is one reference in Exodus 21:22, which depending on the translation refers to either miscarriage or premature birth caused by recklessness.  There is no reference, that I am aware of, to ""fetal murder.""  There are a few passages that ascribe different ""value"" to lives depending on age, and there is a passage (2 Kings 2:21) that refers to miscarriage as a bad thing.  But there is nothing in either old or new that explicitly say, ""abortion is wrong.""

What gets me so hung-up about this is the fact that the political church treats abortion as a *core issue*.  As I see it, core issues should be limited to things that the Bible/Jesus actually talked about, like pride, judgment, hypocrisy, and greed.  Instead, the Church is entirely hung up on issues that require reading between the lines to ""discern"" the supposed Biblical position.

Abortion isn't the only issue that's a stretch, but it seems to be the most extreme.  For instance, at least within the ""youth movement"" the Church seems to be entirely hung-up on premarital sex, yet in the old testament context, it is treated as a property issue, and in the new testament it is unaddressed.  Homosexuality is another one; while both old and new contain passages condemning it, there are plenty of cues that cultural relativity and context should be applied.  I don't even remember off the top of my head what issues the Church seems to care about anymore.  I got so fed up with it.

I'd been going to a Mennonite church for a few years where none of these made-up issues were allowed into the forefront, and where the discussion usually leans toward tolerance, charity, and peacemaking.  But geography and demographics are making it harder for me to keep up with that fellowship, and I just can't seem to find another one where I don't get absolutely infuriated whenever I walk in.  

Anyway, my core question is about abortion, and nobody has given me a satisfactory answer or one that isn't some wishy-washy ambiguous interpretive line of crap.  I feel like Goliath challenging the Israelites when I raise issues like this in a church community- ""Is there no one who will challenge me?""",,False,,t5_2ryd5,False,,,True,t3_qyvqr,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/qyvqr/why_isnt_abortion_discussed_in_the_bible/,

I've seen people (friends of mine whom I trust) walk into prayer meetings with crutches and boots on their feet, burdened with pain, leave it without their crutches or casts, jumping in excitement because they had been healed. I have a co-worker who was having trouble with exhaustion, as well as a number of other symptoms, get diagnosed as anemic. After receiving prayer and going back to the hospital for a second appointment, the same doctor wasn't able to find any iron deficiency in her body whatsoever. A friend of mine tells a similar story about one of his family members, only it was with cancerous cells (in his jaw, I believe). I also have three close friends all with serious allergies (the kind where you can get ill for weeks), receive prayer and allergies that they were suffering from literally the day before (and had received treatment for their entire life) have disappeared entirely and they can now eat whatever they please.

All of these (besides the instance with the cancerous cells) are people whom I personally know and trust. I could go on for a while. I have also seen people pray for strangers on the street/in public and had them experience healing (much to their shock and disbelief).

Feel free to ask me questions about any of these, or other examples that I've seen. *My question for you all is: What would seeing or experiencing something like this do to your belief?*

Would you rationalize it away? Would it convince you of Christianity (even if you still couldn't explain it logically or philosophically)? Would you be frightened or incredulous and ignore it? 

If any of you *have* experienced anything like this, what was your reaction? I will say that growing up I was extremely skeptical of healings, and though I didn't know the term, I was definitely a cessationist. Once I saw God manifest himself through healing, though, especially in the context of people I know and trust, I had to radically re-think my theology.


EDIT: I would really like to keep from turning into a discussion of ""does healing exist"" because, even as a Christian, I think that healing, and most gifts of the Spirit, are a mystery that we can't logically explain. I will say that I completely recognize that a number of healings are probably bogus publicity stunts or done for money, but those are typically also the ones that are hyped and glorified and done on stage in big venues by travelling healers (who I think are typically scam artists). All of the examples I gave are really not glamorous at all. Usually they happened in a small room in my school, office, or a friend's house, and often they were instances of friends praying for other friends (specifically friends who have been educated in the spiritual gifts and who actively believe in modern day physical healing through prayer) and pastors or Christian ""celebrities"" weren't involved at all. **I'm more interested in whether people's beliefs that are grounded in their rationalization and what they've been taught are/can be influenced by what they see, experience, or hear testimonies of.**",,False,,t5_2ryd5,True,,,True,t3_qobud,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/qobud/atheists_or_cessasionist_christians_if_you_saw_a/,

1322717636.0,17,self.DebateAChristian,mvsfu,The incoherency of Paul's gospel in four easy verses.,Basilides,22,5,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/mvsfu/the_incoherency_of_pauls_gospel_in_four_easy/,"8 Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers and sisters. 9 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men 10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. (1 Cor 6)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
These 4 verses reveal several problems with Paul's gospel. 

First of all, in verse 8, Paul speaks in the present tense saying that certain Christians ""cheat and do wrong"". But in verse 11 Paul describes the same behavior in the past tense, ""swindlers...that is what some of you *were*"". How is it that between verses 8 and 11 *current* swindlers became *former* swindlers? Paul seems to be encouraging his followers to engage in magical thinking. Just remember that you are Christian and you are no longer a swindler.

But the real incoherence comes in verse 9.

""Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God?'

Say what? Throughout his writings, Paul goes on and on about how Christians are made righteous (i.e. not judged by the law) through Christ's sacrifice. But in 1 Cor 6 he says that wrongdoing Christians are not saved. Please note: in this passage Paul does *not* say that wrongdoing is merely *evidence* of the absence of salvation. He says, ""wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God"". No qualifiers. Behavior results in condemnation. Even for Christians.

If Paul really taught that the Mosaic law was abolished and/or that Christians are no longer subject to the penalty for breaking the Mosaic law, then there is only one possible explanation for Paul's announcement that Christians are condemned for wrongdoing: Paul is the new lawgiver. The law is dead. Long live the law. The law as determined by Paul. How do we know this? Paul gives us his own pet list of sinful behaviors. Jesus never said anything about ""men who have sex with men"". But Paul puts homosexual behavior on *his* particular list of ""thou shalt nots"".

So with Paul we have:

1) Christian swindlers transforming into sanctified non-swindlers just by remembering that they are Christians. 

2) The penalty for breaking the law abolished...then re-established.

Paul is just all over the place. His gospel is incoherent. Unless you cherry pick the parts you like...the way Paul cherry picks the laws he wants us to follow..

1) Why are women uniquely penalized, based upon the conduct of a character in a metaphorical tale?

""A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14 And **Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.** 15 But women will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety."" (1 Timothy 2)

2) If Paul did not teach the Genesis creation account as literal history, please explain the metaphorical meaning of 1 Corinthians 11:8.

""For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; 9 neither was man created for woman, but woman for man."" (1 Corinthians 11:8)

3) If the Genesis account is strictly a metaphor please explain how it is that a man and a woman existed at the beginning of creation.

""But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.'"" (Mark 10:6)

In the above verse Jesus, while teaching about divorce, was alluding to Genesis 2...

""Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib[h] he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.

 23 The man said,

   “This is now bone of my bones
   and flesh of my flesh;
she shall be called ‘woman,’
   for she was taken out of man.”

 24 That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh. (Genesis 2)

In Romans 1:20 Paul backs up Jesus' statement in Mark 10:6 saying that humans have been around ""since the creation of the world"".

4) If the Genesis account is to be understood as metaphorical and not literal history, why does Paul repeatedly state that sin entered the world through one act by one man and contrast that supposedly metaphorical first man, Adam, with a literal last man, Jesus?

Alan Hayward wrote:

""Worse still, if we treat the Fall of Adam as a piece of religious fiction we strike at the very heart of the Christian gospel. The liberal is forced to reinterpret Paul’s teaching about salvation through Christ’s Cross in this fashion:

For as in [the fictitious] Adam all die, so also in the [real] Christ shall all be made alive.... Just as we have borne the image of the [fictitious] man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the [real] man of heaven (I Corinthians 15:22,49).

If, because of one [fictitious] man’s trespass, death reigned through that one [fictitious] man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the [real] free gift of righteousness [truly] reign in life through the one [real] Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17).

Such a blend of fact and fiction is a flimsy foundation on which to build a doctrine of eternal life. Observe how Paul weaves Adam’s sin and Christ’s righteous death together into the very fabric of salvation. Paul evidently regarded Adam and Christ as the two key characters in human history, each playing a vital role in the destiny of mankind. But if Paul was mistaken, and Adam’s fall is actually little more than a touching tale for tiny tots, then why should we believe Paul when he tells us that Christ rose miraculously from the dead? And “if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile,” Paul warns us (I Corinthians 15:17)

additional notes:

In Luke 11:51-52 Jesus says Abel was the first prophet killed. No Adam and Eve, no Abel.

Matthew 24:38-39 says Jesus thought the Flood was a historical event.

In Romans 5:12 Paul says Adam was a person.

I should preface this by stating that I'm an atheist, so for me the question of God's omnipotence and the logical consequences of it is neatly resolved by saying that ""omnipotence"" is a meaningless, self-contradictory term. However, I've noticed that it's very much a part of pretty much every monotheist's idea of God, so I've been wondering how the contradictions in that are resolved.

Can God create anything that He can't then alter? Can He make anything with properties that would then defy His powers? And if He can't, is he truly omnipotent?

Hell, why is it even important that God be omnipotent? Wouldn't it be sufficient for Him to be able to do much, much more than we can? Why, when the concept of omnipotence is so logically tricky and there's nothing in nature to suggest the word ""omnipotence"" corresponds to anything real or possible, is it necessary that God be precisely that?

Sorry it took me so long to get back on here, I hope this thread hasn't died just yet. 

Thank you for all of your responses! People seem to have been a little side-tracked by the fact that I chose to include the idea of disbelieving in other religions as part of the definition for being a Christian. Sorry about that, I realized it was a generalization as I was typing it, but decided to keep it in there anyway, because it helps to convey the way that I understand/assume Christians feel about their Christian-ness...? I imagine, if I were a Christian, I would feel like other religions somehow had it ""wrong,"" or at least, ""not as right."" 

Secondly, for those of you who answered that you choose to be Christian because you choose to be a follower of Jesus, could you explain in more detail WHY you think Jesus is the noblest spiritual adviser/role-model/leader (and why that struck you as being impressive enough to call yourself HIS follower, rather than some other impressive person's follower)? Also, why can't you follow Jesus, but NOT call yourself a Christian? Why can't he just be a cool guy you aspire to live like? Is it because he tells you you should be a Christian, that you can't be true to him if you're not?

Acts 4:12

The entire premise of Christianity is that God incarnated himself as Jesus Christ to be sacrificed as the only means of salvation for man.  According to the Bible and to the Christian god, this is the *only* way to be saved and enter heaven.  If anyone else gets in, it negates the purpose of Jesus Christ and his exclusive salvation.  

If a non-Christian can enter it means you don't have to believe in Christianity at all.  A God who was allowing non-Christians into heaven would clearly not be related to Jesus Christ and would have to base his judgments on merit and good deeds.  This is not the case in Christianity, it is a system which specifically rewards faith and belief, not actions and behavior.  Actions are not enough in the eyes of Jesus, you must recognize him as your personal savior.

If you want to call yourself a Christian, you must also say that the vast majority of the human species is going to hell and that God intended it to be this way.  This didn't get out of hand for God, this is the way the Christian god wanted it.

I'm beyond frustrated with Christians trying to take the 'good' route when it comes to eternal judgment.  If you want to believe that God sees the inherent good in people and will judge accordingly then you don't agree with the Christian God and, if he was real, this God would take offense to your belief that a human could enter God's presence based only on a charitable, loving, and selfless life.  If you believe others gain entrance to heaven, your God does not agree with you.

For the life of me, I don't understand, when faced with the fact that the religion explicitly requires the eternal suffering of the majority of our species, how anyone could want to follow this God.

Quoted below the whole unedited post.

&gt;Why are we here?
&gt;
&gt;No, really. Why did god bother creating us in the first place?
&gt;
&gt;Most Christians I have spoken to will answer with ""God was bored/lonely."" If you look at the definitions of the words bored and lonely, they both imply a lack of something, in this case stimulation or companionship. To think that god was bored is just silly because being bored comes from having nothing to do to fill the hours. Christians believe that god was here, existing in the infinity outside of time, and then suddenly got the urge to create. It's ludicrous to imagine that an omnipotent being, just chillin in the great nothingness of space, would give even a blip of a consideration to making our microscopic planet. Also, I think all Christians agree with the idea that God is perfect, but to be perfect is to be complete, and a complete god lacks nothing. So clearly he didn't create the universe out of boredom or loneliness. The other answer I get is ""Because he wanted to."" Again--to want is to lack, and a perfect god lacks nothing.

&gt;From this point in the discussion, it progresses in one of two ways: either they'll regurgitate that old favorite, ""With God all things are possible,"" or they'll switch to another point entirely (i.e. ""But what about this other thing that god did, that's pretty special, huh?) This says to me that no one has any idea what the hell god was thinking when he made us. I have not yet gotten what I consider to be a satisfactory answer, meaning one that makes any sort of sense.

&gt;If you have an answer, let me know. I could use a laugh.

Now, I’ll pose this analogy: for those of you with children, would you ever send your child to burn for eternity for saying you’re not his/her biological parent? What if your child was aware that you threatened to do it, thereby “choosing” it? If God’s love for us is supposedly superior to humans, how could he let us go to hell?

The most common answer I see is: “He doesn’t send us there. It is the default for refusing God.”

First, that still leaves the problem above; a parent letting their child burn because the child refused to acknowledge that the parent is the real mom/dad. A parent would surely stop it. If God can’t stop it, how is he omnipotent?

Second, if God created hell, then he knew when creating it that we would go there for not believing in him, so the case that he’s innocent in the situation is bogus. If I strap a time bomb on you and say that if you don’t say the magic words, it’s going to explode by default, it’s still my fault for strapping it on you to begin with. Same goes with being sent to hell.

First, I rarely see a Christian propose a resolution to be debated on here.  Second, I feel like writing my thoughts will help them coalesce.  Third, because I feel like my position is defensible.  And finally, I have been somewhat disappointed in the rigor of these debates, and the level of respect given to Christians who choose to talk about their faith here.  

I wrote this a while ago, but decided to post it due to another post today.

My belief in a higher being follows roughly that which was offered in [The Evolution of God](http://www.amazon.com/The-Evolution-Back-Readers-Pick/dp/031606744X) by Robert Wright.  I am a big fan of his, and you should read his books.  That said, what follows is an outline of *my position* and should not be implied to other Christians or individuals of faith.  Which brings me to my first point.

I. Does this debate even make sense?

Faith is personal.  Debating it is a bit like debating musical taste.  It is subjective and based upon the interpretation of the individual experiencing it.  What you experience is not what another will.  Moreover, religion is a function of culture and the two are inseparable.  You cannot argue it in or out of existence.  But, here I am debating it, so let me address the reasons I do so.

A.  Christians can be dicks.

I get it.  I feel the same revulsion when a Christian group takes over a school board in Kansas and takes evolution out of the curriculum.  It makes my blood boil when Christians use the Bible as justification for their preconceived prejudice.  I also understand how it feels to be a minority voice in a sea of that type of shit, and the ridicule and exclusion that comes with it.

Please understand, however, that not all Christians are that way.  In fact, I think only a very vocal minority of Christians are that way.  I think most go to Church most Sundays and “are not very political” like most other Americans.  Please do not conflate conservative political views with Christianity.  I will concede that there is a correlation, but I don’t think that there is necessary a causal relationship (more on this later).

B.  There is little logic in Religion.

I’m sorry but this is just the way it is.  I suspect that this is why people turn to religion when there is no logical explanation for the purpose of something.  This is the age-old question of why bad things happen to good people.  I understand that an atheist would state simply that there is *no purpose*, that the universe is random, and that bad things happen randomly.  My argument is that that viewpoint is not of much value when you have just lost a loved one, or been diagnosed with a terminal illness, or found out that your wife never loved you.  These are times when it is human to ask *why?*.

Either way this debate cannot take place in the form of mathematical proof.  Any Christian who says so is fooling himself, and any atheist that says so is denying natural human spirituality.

II.  Spirituality is Built In.

*Why?* is the quintessential human question.  Humans began answering this question with their imagination.  Bad things happened because of this god, good things happened because of that god.  There were tons and tons of gods: gods for things, gods for people, gods for groups of people.
When humans discovered scientific explanations for the world around us, the purview of the spiritual explanations accordingly dwindled.  The rainstorm did not come from the rain god, but rather from a cold front of air plowing underneath a warmer pocket of air lifting it to where it cooled causing water to condense and fall out of it.

Today, it seems that everything has a scientific explanation.  It seems like that.  But I contend that there is still much we do not know.  My personal view is that the complexity of the Universe is infinite, and that science will thus never be able to explain it. I, also, contend that our understanding is implicitly limited by the Uncertainty Principle, in that we will never understand what the Universe was like *before we looked at it*.  In other words, science will always leave a little, even if very, very small part of nature unexplained.  This question of “why?” will never be fully satisfied by science.  Thus, in the religion vs. science paradigm, I think there will always be room for religion.

A. 	So what if it’s built in?

One’s life is basically the interaction between many different interrelated, but distinct spheres.  These include, but are not limited to your physical body, the mind, your social interactions, and spiritual questions.  Humans have developed different mechanism to ensure the health of these different spheres.  Concerning physical health, we exercise, go to the doctor, eat right, whatever to make sure that our physical selves are functioning correctly.  Concerning the mind, we educate ourselves, do puzzles, debate one another, and many other things to ensure our mental health and stability.  The delineation of the various aspects of humanity is not really important for this purpose.  What is important is the understanding that we do things to ensure the health and sustainability of various aspects of our lives.

Religion is humanity’s attempt at giving structure and discipline to the inquiry into the unanswerable questions.  It is my contention that it is good for people to develop this part of themselves.  It gives meaning beyond game-theory to altruism, for instance.  It brings certain concepts like love and selflessness to the forethought rather than the afterthought.  So, if it is built in to at least some degree, I feel it should be developed through discipline and practice in the same way we develop our bodies through exercise and our minds through education.

B.  What if I choose to develop spiritually differently than you?

Short answer: I don’t care.  Look, it is difficult to hear the harmony underneath the noise, but most religions are pretty much the same.    Some very vocal religious extremists do some very terrible things.  But, as aforementioned, most are not extreme and are just going about their daily lives with religion being only one sphere in a person made up of many.

I think that discipline and development of one’s spiritual side is important, I just don’t care how they do it.  I choose to be a Lutheran, because that is the most accessible to me.  Yes, I have tried out other religions (both Christian and non-Christian).  And this seems to be a good fit for me.  To continue an analogy, why would I care whether my friend likes to bike to stay in shape while I like to lift weights.  As long as he is exercising, I don’t care.

C.  What if I choose not to develop spiritually?

This question can be rephrased: What if spiritual development is not a priority for me?  Cool.  Prioritize the way you want.  There is an assumption out there among non-religious folks that religious folks will look down on them for not having their priorities straight.  This assumption is correct much of the time.  It is basically the same thing as a guy who works out looking down on a fat guy.  The workout guy just thinks the fat guy has his priorities wrong.  

This is not for me to judge.  I think that most religious people won’t judge atheists along these same lines.  I just want to point out that this is the source of the disparagement, not some type of pity or lack of understanding.

III.  So Why Christianity and How do you Know that it’s the “Right One”?

As I mentioned, Christianity is just the way that I chose to develop spiritually, I think people should develop their spirituality just as they would develop their bodies or their mind, but I can’t presume to tell people how to do it.  Most religions will say that it is the only true religion.  Accordingly, a few Christians will tell me that this is not right.  But keeping in mind the similarity between religions, I think its rather presumptuous to tell people that one is right for them.

IV.   But your religion says X, Y, and Z and that is dumb!

Any Christian who is not aware that the Bible is not the word of God, but rather people’s interpretation of hearing God in their lives is deluding himself.  I prefer to think of the Bible as a distillation of spiritual wisdom over centuries.  A book to live by spiritually.  Remembering that religion is a cultural animal, it is easy to see that the development of Christianity is like the development of other cultural movements.  

A. Inconsistencies

For example, it is open to other religions at times (when it is good for the movement) and closed to other religions at times (when it is bad for the movement).  The Quran is particularly inconsistent with its regard for other religions.

However, this and the plethora of other internal inconsistencies does not change the value of the message.  Religion is not science, it is not logical.  Whereas a paper on the maize genome that contains inconsistencies can be written off as unpersuasive, the same is not true of these “holy” documents.  They were written over centuries, and are not meant to prove anything, but rather to communicate spiritual ideas and ideals.  They are also subject to varying interpretations.  Whereas a scientific paper should not really be open to various interpretations, a spiritual document almost needs to be to survive changing times.

B.  Interpretation

Here I will simply cut-and-paste from a comment a wrote a while back.
  
&gt;The Bible is a lot like the U.S. Constitution. Both are sacred documents. Both were written long ago. Both are open to many different interpretations pursuant to many different ideologies.
Asking how one should read the Bible is just like asking how one should read the Constitution. I cannot say how people should read the Constitution. I can say how people do read it, and how I read it. But asking whether you are a constructionalist vs. textualist is not really a debate about the document itself. 
So just because the Bible is and should be construed differently by different people does not take away from the value of the document itself.

V.	Conclusion

Well I hope I have covered my bases.  Hit me with questions and challenges and what not.  I will do my best to respond to respectful and helpful comments.

Having said that, there are many reasons I am not a Christian, and by far the biggest reason is the glaring omission of the condemnation of slavery in the old and new testaments.
  
For example, slavery doesn't seem to make it into the ten commandments and the old testament goes so far as to condone slavery:
  
Leviticus 25:44-46  
Exodus   21:2-6  
Exodus   21:7-11 (selling daughter as a sex slave)  
  
So does the new testament:  
  
Luke     12:47-48  
  
There are more, but I think this is a good start for a debate.  
  
The biggest defense to this line of argument is that slavery in these times was completely different than, say, slavery during the time of the American civil war.  Even if that were true, nowhere in the Bible does it say that you are not allowed to own another human being. 
  
And this to me is absolute proof that the Bible was written by people of the time as opposed to the word of God.  As someone who is secular it is very easy to explain why slavery is treated this way in the Bible and by Christ.  As opposed to most atheists I know, I believe the Bible was was written by several groups of well intentioned people, that the idea was to put together one master book of all of the most up to date information that we had at the time (like a predecessor to Wikipedia).  Slavery was condoned by society, thus the Bible condones it.  We can say the same for Christ, and even if he had wanted to stand up against slavery in any form, I think he knew realistically no one would take him seriously as it was such a common practice in the day.  If Christ were truly the son of God, I think at some point in the new testament we would have seen him say something like ""Don't cheat, lie, murder, steal, rape, or own other people"".

2)  Do you consider Jesus Christ to be God, or the son of God.  If the former, how can he have been human, meaning, while he was on earth where was God?

3)  Since some (maybe most or all, I really don't know) sects of Christianity pray to The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit, why is Christianity considered a monotheistic religion if you pray to 3 things?

4)  What are the differences between The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit??  Do they have different powers?  Do you pray to one for certain things and another for other things, or all three for everything?

Assume God is omnipotent and omni-benevolent. God created man with free will, for some reason, whether that be so that we could love Him better or to fufill some greater design of His. The reason is kind of irrelevant to this. In any case, God created man knowing that man had a choice between falling or not falling for reason x. Of course the fall brought sin, and God abhors sin, but he needed the possibility of sin because of reason x. 

But in God's omnipotence, couldn't he have just ""changed the rules of the universe"", and in fact, altered reason itself, so that there would be no reason x for us to need free will? That in fact God could have altered the universe so that we could go on just as happily and God be just as pleased without free will? Or is God bound by even higher, or maybe equivalent notions of ""justice"" and ""love"", ones that He must Himself abide by in order to remain omnibenevolent?

Since when is it acceptable to *force* a person to give parts of their own bodies to support other people?

Of course, lots of people donate blood or platelets, but to *force* someone to give away their blood and platelets would be abhorrent. 

People donate livers, bone marrow, and such to save a life.  But to force someone to give bone marrow?  What a horrifying thought.

So how it it different when we're talking about a pregnant woman and a person she does not want to give her fluids and organs to?

Matthew says Jesus was born in Judea during the reign of Herod the Great and Luke says Jesus was born during the major tax census while Quirinius was governor of Syria. These are both documented historical events but they are also separated by at least 10 years making it historically impossible for Jesus to be born during both events.

---


Apologists have tried to cover up this historical contradiction by making up the claim that there was an earlier census AND that Quirinius was also governor of Syria twice. However Quirinius was never the governor of Syria prior to 6 CE and was the governor of Pamphylia-Galatia (in modern Turkey) during the last years of King Herod. Also there was not another large census within 100 years prior to 6 CE.

Some apologists claim that in Matthew 2 ""King Herod"" refers to Herod the Great's son, Herod Antipas. However, Matthew 2 is in fact talking about Herod the Great. It mentions that Herod is king of Judea and only Herod the Great was king of Judea. Antipas only the ruler of Galilee and Perea. Also Herod Antipas lived until 39 CE yet the Herod talked about in Matthew died while Jesus was a child according to Matthew 2:19.

Conclusion: The nativity story most likely never happened and was a work of fiction by gospel writers. I have not found any apologist explanation that does not contain what I already refuted, so I would like some input. 

Also, if this story was made up by the gospel writers then wouldn't that mean that they weren't inspired by God? If this isn't evidence that Jesus of Nazareth was just a normal man and his divinity was just added on by the early Christians, then what evidence would convince you?

I don't think it's bold to predict that, as time passes, the Abrahamic religions will only continue to diverge, and no amount of debate and discussion will resolve the mess that's out there.

On the other hand, lots of different types of hard sciences - biology, physics, chemistry, and mathematics initially started completely separately with no intention of unifying, and throughout time, each of the sciences has really come together in some elegant and beautiful ways, and the borders between them have become blurred to the point where it's really become impossible to say where one science begins and the other one ends.  

As time passes, the understanding of the universe from an Abrahamic religion follower's perspective will only become more confused as this religion messily evolves into more and more sects, while the understanding of the universe through science (which says nothing about a god) becomes more complete, unified, and beautiful.

But this post is not about science vs. religion.  It's about the kind of thinking that leads to either - skepticism vs. faith.

The type of thinking that religion rises from is faith-based.  A believer hedges his whole interpretation of reality on two things:  1.  The assumption that a book is divinely inspired and the complete truth, and 2.  The believer's church has a monopoly on the complete, correct interpretation of that holy book.  A believer frames his/her understanding based on this.  There is no objective measure that a believer's interpretation of his holy book is correct, and no way to verify.  

The type of thinking that sciences rises from is skepticism-based.  If an observation contradicts a scientist's understanding, and if the scientist does not adjust his theory, he is laughed out of the community.  A scientist has to humble himself to the fact that the discovery of science is an imperfect search, and that he's prone to that imperfection.  But the base of knowledge continues to grow, and there is always progress in the uphill climb.  We've built some amazing things with this type of thinking discipline, and we've even put a man on the moon with it.  Without expecting it, we've achieved a beautiful convergence of our understanding of the universe from this kind of thinking, and within that framework there is no necessity of a god (or an Abrahamic religion-based god).  

Seeing the results of faith-based thinking vs skepticism-based thinking throughout time and history, could a Christian say with 100% confidence and honesty that through their faith, they actually have the monopoly on the understanding of reality with endorsement from some supreme being?

Looking at Jesus, he loved those around him, and arguably all of humanity.  That alone would give me just cause to trade my life so that all of them could be ""saved"".  But the fact is that by Christian dogma Jesus knew, to some extent, the grand plan, ie. that he would be tortured and die a mortal death, come back, and then ascend to Heaven to be with his father in paradise for all eternity.  Knowing that, he didn't sacrifice anything, he accepted a mortal death, albeit a horrible one, and was granted paradise for all eternity.

In summary, (by christian dogma) Jesus accepted a horrible method of death for a guaranteed eternity in paradise... where is the sacrifice?

So one third of God died for 72 hours. Does that mean that one third of God's brain was destroyed for 72 hours? How does one third of an infinite being die without being one third finite?

**2)** Animals sacrificed in the Old Testament never came back to life. They made a real sacrifice. The sacrifice of their lives. Permanently. Jesus' sacrifice as the passover lamb was only for 72 hours. How can that possibly be considered equivalent to the permanent and irrevocable sacrifice of a passover lamb?

**3)** God the Father hated all humans because the first human disobeyed him by eating an apple. God the father expressed this hatred by cursing all of us from birth with a sinful nature. Then he punishes each one of us with death because we fail to resist the sinful nature he cursed us with. So it is God's will that we sin and it is God's will that we do not sin. The deity is a psycho. He apparently experience some kind of psychotic break around the year 1, impregnating an earth woman with himself (whom he referred to as ""son""). God the Father's split personality (Jesus) decided to save humanity from his other personality (God the Father) by offering himself as a human sacrifice for every sin that ever was or ever will be committed. 

**4)** But this sacrifice business is just a hold over from the meaningless and barbaric sacrifice ritual that God the father introduced in the Old Testament: animal sacrifice. Genesis 8:21 says that God the father likes the smell of burning animal flesh. Apparently, he liked the smell of his own tormented flesh on the cross. 

**5)** Jesus was supposedly the one and only perfect sacrifice because he was sinless. Which is also stupid because goats and sheep are incapable of sin. *All* animal sacrifices were sinless sacrifices! Every goat and sheep was just as untainted by sin as Jesus. Apparently, Jesus was the most perfect *physical* specimen ever offered to God as a sacrifice. The Aztecs would be envious.

**6)** In the Old Testament the animal sacrifice itself temporarily saved people from God's wrath *without the people of the community having to believe anything about the sacrifice*. Therefore, Jesus' sacrifice should save all of us *without us having to believe anything about Jesus or the sacrifice*.

**7)** Jesus himself and several passages in the Old Testament say that God does not desire sacrifice. He desires that humans express mercy and a contrite heart. Well, God did not see any mercy or contrition from us when he got himself killed. So why on earth should we believe personality #2's death made personality #1 (God the father) change his mind about cursing humans with a sinful nature and death?

**8)** Christians suffer from a mighty form of cognitive dissonance. They believe that Jesus conquered death *physically* so that they can conquer death *spiritually*. That is: Christians believe they are *spiritually* resurrected because Jesus was *physically* resurrected. If Christians were being logically consistent they would concede that Jesus was also spiritually and not physically resurrected. 

The Pope agrees.

""A further point emerges from this discussion. Given the foregoing considerations, it goes without saying that the life of him who has risen from the dead is ***not once again bios***, the biological form of our mortal life within history; it is zoe, new, different, definitive life; life that has stepped ***beyond the mortal realm of bios and history***, a realm that has here been surpassed by a greater power. And in fact the Resurrection narratives of the New Testament allow us to see clearly that the life of the Risen One lies, ***not within the historical bios***, but beyond and above it.""

.

FYI all

I'm not an expert on this subject and haven't  studied all these positions in detail, but -

&gt;Support and affirmation of marriage rights for same-sex couples increasingly come from those who practice progressive Christianity. 

&gt;**Some examples of religious organizations voicing their support for marriage equality include the Metropolitan Community Church, the United Church of Christ ""Marriage Equality and the UCC""., the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Episcopal Church of the United States, the Anglican Church of Canada, the Evangelical Lutheran Church In America and the Unitarian Universalists church which has long supported the rights of gays and lesbians to marry both in the church and through the state.**

&gt;Several well established Christian denominations support the legality of same-sex marriage and perform same-sex weddings and blessings religiously. The three largest of these denominations in North America are **the Episcopal Church of the United States, the United Church of Canada and the United Church of Christ.**

&gt;While self-identified progressive faith organizations such as **the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)**, support marriage equality, other more conservative and or orthodox organizations including **some Mennonite churches, the Church of the Brethren, the Old Catholic Church, the Church of Sweden and the Church of Scotland** also support marriage rights for gay and lesbian persons.

&gt;**Members of Reform Judaism** support the inclusion of same-sex unions within the definition of marriage. **The Jewish Reconstructionist Federation** leaves the choice to individual rabbis.

&gt;Some Conservative Jews reject recognition of same-sex unions as marriages, but permit celebration of commitment ceremonies, in part as an expression of their belief that scripture requires monogamy of all sexually active couples.

&gt;Due to the ambivalent language about homosexuality in Buddhist teachings, there has been no official stance put forth regarding the issue of marriage between members of the same gender.

&gt;There is no objection of the Buddha found in the Tipitaka. Buddha was neither supportive nor against marriages between members of the same gender. [I should note that this is also true of  Jesus.] 

&gt;There are both conservative and liberal views about homosexuality and same-sex marriages in Hinduism, similar to many other religions.

My question is about the Christian God. If my understanding is correct, this is a separate entity from Jesus. And the central philosophy behind Christianity is that Jesus died for everyone's sins and people will go to heaven if they accept this fact.

So the Christian God is into human sacrifice? I mean, He accepts a persons death as an appeasement of his wrath? So death appeases Him, ie makes Him forgiving and happy? I mean to me it seems Jesus death made God happy enough to forgive peoples sins.

As such, it is the religion they worship and honor, not God. Furthermore, the Christian's insistence on the historical reality of miracles (such as the resurrection) is, for me, evidence of their disbelief. They have thrown out God and believe instead in a religion. A God that *has to conform* to a religion is not God.

I can't see why God would manifest him/her/it self primarily through ancient miracles and writings. ***Reality as we know it is message enough.*** The real gospel is written in every molecule of creation. It is not uniquely imparted in a few ancient writings and events. But creation as we know it is simply not good enough for Christians. 

If, for the Christian, a miracle *must have* happened and uniquely sacred writings *must* exist, then the Christian is saying: 

""If there was no miracle (the resurrection) and no uniquely sacred writings, then there is no God.""

Why does God have to perform parlor tricks for these people to prove he exists? Why are these people (Christians) so incapable of seeing the miracle of life without these supernatural pretensions? 

It is for these reasons I say that Christianity is an insult to God. If there is a God.

I am occasionally accused by Christians of attacking or criticizing God. As if it is the Christians job to defend God. As if it is Christianity that represents God. But my response is always the same:

God needs no defense. 

But religion is in constant need of defense. This is because religion is just another creation of man.

“**Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.** 21 Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh. (Luke 6)

30 Give to everyone who asks of you, and whoever takes away what is yours, do not demand it back. (Luke 6)

""Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
   
""But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break
through nor steal:
   
""For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.""
(Matthew 6:19-21)

In The Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus, Jesus pictures one man in hell, whose only related vice is that in life he was rich; and another in heaven, whose only related virtue is that in life he was poor (Luke 16:19-31). 

Jesus affirms it is more difficult for a rich man to get into heaven, than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle (Luke 18:25). 

And Paul describes a Christian community as essentially communist.

13 Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, **but that there might be equality**. 14 At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. Then there will be equality, 15 as it is written: “He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little.” (2 Cor 8)

That's standard communist dogma. No class distinctions. From each according to his abilities. To each according to his needs.

44 All the believers were together and had **everything in common**. 45 They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. (Acts 2)

The Jerusalem church was a small community compared to the millions of alleged Christians alive today. But most individual churches are smaller than the 3,000 plus members of the early Jerusalem church. 

""41 Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day."" (Acts 2)

Yet modern small Christian communities still do not act and think like 1st century Christians in regard to material wealth. Why is that? 

""By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?"" (Matthew 7:16)

The serpent placed the (competing) idea of eating the apple, the *desire* to eat the apple, into Eve's mind.

According to Jesus, this was the first sin. Eve was no longer single-minded.

The light of the body is the eye: *if therefore thine eye be single*, thy whole body shall be full of light. (Matthew 6:22)

29 If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. (Matthew 5)

Jesus was not talking about a literal eye or a literal hand. He was talking about singleness of purpose and competing ideas/desires. He was talking about sinful thoughts. Eve had the first sinful thought. And Yahweh made it happen.

",Basilides,21,8,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/ir96o/because_heaven_and_earth_have_not_disappeared_the/,":...**until heaven and earth disappear**, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished."" (Matthew 5:18)


Many, if not most, Christians claim this passage does not mean that heaven and earth must disappear/pass away before the Law ceases to exist/be in effect. They ignore the heaven and earth passage and insist that the ""all"" that is to be ""accomplished"" is isolated to the death and resurrection of Jesus.

But let's look at this *in context*.

Our first piece of context is Matthew 24 where Jesus talks about the ""all"" that needs to be ""accomplished"".

All of the following events are to happen, be *accomplished*, long *after* the resurrection and ascension.

4 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. **Such things must happen (i.e must be *accomplished*), but the end is still to come.** 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 **All these are the beginning of birth pains.**

Another component of the ""all"" that needs to be accomplished before Heaven and Earth can pass away and the Law can disappear/be abolished....

14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, **and then the end will come.**

Then Jesus discusses Heaven and Earth passing away...

21 **For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.**

The worst thing ever. What could that possibly be? The destruction (disappearance/passing away) of the earth as we know it, perhaps?

29 “Immediately after the distress of those days

“‘the sun will be darkened,
and the moon will not give its light;
**the stars will fall from the sky,
and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’**

30 “Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. 31 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.

32 “Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. 33 Even so, **when you see all these things (accomplished?), you know that it is near, right at the door**. 34 Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened **(been accomplished?)**. 35 **Heaven and earth will pass away**, but my words will never pass away. 

Jesus states unequivocally, ""**Heaven and earth will pass away**"". This is what is known as a ""prophecy"", a promise from God that this event *will* happen.

This *prophecy* is repeated *verbatim* in Mark and Luke.

Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. (Mark 13:31)

Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. (Luke 21:33)

When Jesus promised in all three synoptic gospels that ""heaven and earth will pass away"" he was not using a figure of speech or engaging in hyperbole. He was referring to a what he believed to be a literal event, the ""all"" that was to be ""accomplished"". We know this because in the next few verses of Matthew 24, Jesus compares the last moments before Heaven and Earth pass away to the times of Noah. And he talks about the flood as a *literal historical event*.

37 As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; 39 and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

2 Peter 3 also compares the literal disappearance of the Heavens and the Earth to the days of Noah...

""...long ago by God’s word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water. 6 By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. 7 By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.

10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare."" (2 Peter 3)

Notice that both Jesus and the author of 2 Peter use the word ""disappear"" in relation to the fate of the heavens and the Earth. And Peter is *definitely* talking about a literal event.

1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. (Revelation 21)

Now let's take another look at the passage Christians do their best to ignore or explain away as meaningless hyperbole.

18 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. (Matthew 5:18)

Isn't that something? Jesus relates the *accomplishment* of *all* prophecy to the disappearance or passing away of heaven and earth. And then, in Mark 13, Matthew 24 and Luke 21 he promises point blank, ""Heaven and earth *will* pass away"" and relates it to the survival of specific words, ""but *my* words will never pass away"". He is stating again and again and *again*, for those who are willing to listen: When heaven and earth pass away (disappear) the Mosaic law will also disappear...but the words of Jesus will never disappear.

4 ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for **the old order of things has passed away**.” (Revelation 21)

Call me crazy, but *order* usually means ""law"". It's right there in the book of Revelation. When the first heaven and the first earth pass away (disappear) the old order (the Mosaic Law) will pass away (disappear) right along with them. the Book of Revelation agrees with all three of the synoptic gospels. Christians don't seem to agree with any of them.

Now there is one more interesting point to make about the Book of Revelation.

1 Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb 2 down the middle of the great street of the city. **On each side of the river stood the tree of life**, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. (Revelation 22)

After the old heaven and the old earth have passed away (disappeared) humanity again has access to the Tree of Life.

Why is this important? As strange as it may sound, for fallen man, the Tree of Life *is* the Mosaic Law, the Torah.

'It is a tree of life to those who take hold of it, and those who support it are fortunate' (Proverbs 3:18).

Mankind recaptured that exalted spiritual plateau of Adam before his primeval sin at Sinai (Shabbos 145b) when the Jewish nation received the Torah – itself called Etz Chaim, ""the Tree of Life"" (Mishlei 3:18). 

http://www.torah.org/learning/livinglaw/5767/chukas.html

And this relates to something written in the Book of Hebrews...

23 It was necessary, then, for the *copies of the heavenly things* to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 24 For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was *only a copy of the true one*; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God’s presence. (Hebrews 9)

So everything in the Holy of Holies was a copy of a heavenly thing. But what was in the Holy of Holies?

1 Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary. 2 A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand and the table with its consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. 3 Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, 4 which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and *the stone tablets of the covenant.* 5 Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now. (Hebrews 9)

Notice what was inside the ark? ""The stone tablets of the covenant."" The Law. The Torah. The earthly copy of the Tree of Life which is protected in heaven by what? The two cherubim..... which are *copied* on the cover of the Ark of the Covenant! Are you getting this yet?

The Tree of Life was the original Law. After the Fall of Man, man no longer had access to the Tree of Life (the heavenly thing). And so the Mosaic Law, the Torah, was created as a replacement for (a copy of) the heavenly thing, the Tree of Life. When heaven and earth pass away (disappear) the Mosaic Law *also* disappears and it is replaced by the original Torah, the Tree of Life.

To start, I enjoy a good debate, I think it's a way we can find common ground, and recognize that we're not so different from each other, it's just that we believe differently.  You also can see that most debates here are not about us trying to ""convert"" you, but rather sharing with you what we believe, since we're debating, that's the very core of any reply we make on here is it not?

I think some nice ground rules should be set for debating.  For starters, We are aware you don't like christians in general.  Most of you are more Anti-Theist then atheist anyway, and that's ok.  The subreddit makes no claims we will only debate a specific people, it claims you will debate us.  So that said, can we agree for you to stop the rude comments towards us?  At least me and my temper, it makes me want to call you out on your comment, so I'll write up a long reply, then end up deleting it before it even posts.  Why?  Because then you've won the debate, and now we've degraded into childhood name calling.

3. [Asking a valid question about miracles then comparing it to magic.](It's almost as if the so called 'miracles' were little more than illusions in which people actually believed was magic!)

Now I'm not saying you cannot hold a valid debate with us regarding the topic, it's the snarky comments you guys make sometimes that make us not want to give you the time of day.

- How would you explain the existence of other religions? Hinduism was formed around 2,000 BC. That is 2,000 years before Christ came down to the earth. Islam and Christianity trace back to the same ""God of Abraham"" yet there are differences in beliefs.

- If everyone either goes to *hell* or *heaven*, how does one explain the occurrences of ghosts and spirits? Not to mention several cases of [reincarnation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Cases_Suggestive_of_Reincarnation).

&gt;  Matthew 14:26
""And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.""

&gt; Luke 24:39
""Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."" 

Christ believes there are ghosts. 

- &gt;  Genesis1:27 ""Matthew 14:26
""So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.""

So scientists believe theists are [mildly demented](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/health/06nih.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all); I like to use the term ""delusional,"" as I was taught in med school that delusions are ""fixed, false beliefs.""  Just like IQ, height, and a million other variables that make up each person on this planet are distributed on a curve, I honestly believe that true religious believers just happened to have a genetic/cultural/familial predisposition for irrational, illogical thought processes perhaps coupled with an almost pathological need for social acceptance in a group/herd mentality.  I have seen this in my own cultural subgroup of [Korean-Americans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_American#Religion): [fan death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_death) as an example of irrationality and maybe [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tmnMsGm6ZA) as an example of their sheeple behavior, although I'm sure everyone knows the Asian stereotypes already.  (This isn't meant to insult you, I'm just being brutally honest.  I expect the same in return.)

Just out of curiosity, what do you guys think of atheists?  Do you believe that all of Creation intrinsically ""knows"" God and that we're just in denial?  Are we the Devil's agents here to tempt you?  Are we ""challenges"" that God has placed on the Earth during your stay here for you to work on in His name?  Are we just ""delusional"" in our own way and just can't see the obviousness that is God?  Is atheism just another one of the ""false"" religions that worships a false idol?  Is there any other reason you can think of that is consistent with your own Biblical worldview?

A follow up: if you have a personal relationship with Him, and this serves as constant, real-life evidence for your religious belief, why are you so special that you deserve face-time with the Big Man?

Most of the times the discussions have taken place during the later stages of weekend evenings, where either just me or all parties involved have been rather marinated. One question in particular has stayed with me from these alcohol fueled nights into reality. Essentially, it's a very simple question, but when I think about it, the ability of a Christian to provide an answer is really important.

The question goes: *A 90 year old man is lying on his death bed. He has been a good man for his entire life. Being a doctor, he has saved the lives of countless people working at a free clinic in his homeland somewhere in Asia. Now, before he dies, a pair of Christian missionaries comes to him, gives him a bible and asks him if he has ever heard about Jesus, which he, naturally, hasn't. They go on by giving him a 101 in Christianity and asks if he accepts Jesus Christ as his lord and savior, which he doesn't, since he's been a Hindu all his life. Some time later, the man dies without having admitted to Christianity. Will he go to heaven?*

Since the man in the story was introduced to Christianity and denied it, I would think that the general opinion of Christians is that the man won't be allowed to enter heaven. The people I've been talking to, however, have answered either, *""yes""*, *""no""* or *""I don't know""*. In my opinion, all of these answers are flawed and here's why:

**Yes** - The man goes to heaven.

This would eliminate the need for a good person to be Christian in order to go to heaven after he/she dies. Now, some of the people I've been talking to propose that being Christian will earn them a better place in heaven, that there are different levels of heaven if you will. I would argue that there is no such thing as a ""better place"" in a place with the characteristics of heaven as proposed by Christians. Assuming there's no jealousy, suffering or fear in heaven, there are no such things as a ""better"" or ""worse"" place. It's all the same. Consequently, there's no point in being a Christian.

**No** - The man goes to hell.

This is the general opinion among Christians (I think), which says that, unless you aren't oblivious of Christianity, the only way to be allowed into heaven is by accepting Jesus Christ as your lord. If this is the case, it would also mean that any person who's lived a, by Christian standards) bad life may enter heaven as long as he abides to Christianity. This is when most Christians again bring up the possibility of getting to better or worse places in heaven, which, as stated previously, I call a moot point.

**I don't know** - The man goes... somewhere.

This is the one that bothers me. If a person claiming to be a Christian doesn't know whether or not a good but faithless person will be damned or not, what's the point of believing in God?

This means that it is logically possible for the person to pick the good choice at t^1 . Now the person is presented with another moral choice at t^2 , and once again it is logically possible for them to pick the good. This same scenario is true through t^n .

But if it is logically possible to pick the good at each point in the series, then it is logically possible to pick the good at every point in the series. If this is true, then there is a logically possible state of affairs where an individual always freely choses the good. And if one individual can do it, then I think it is possible for every agent to do it. This means that there is a logically possible state of affairs where everyone always picks the good.

If it is a logically possible state of affairs, then God can actualize it. If He cannot actualize it then he is not omnipotent, and if he can actualize it, but does not, then he is not all good. And if God is necessarily omnipotent and all good then he does not exist.

Edit: I'll respond to the most popular objection.

Now your objection is that there aren't genuinely free choice in this world, but I object that if this world does not contain genuine moral choices then no world does. This is because a possible world is a complete picture of reality. The truth value of every proposition for that world is settled.

When God creates he choses to actualize a particular possible world. So, if he actualizes a world where the proposition, ""Philo12 sins"" is true, my sinning is predetermined in the sense that in this world, it is true that I will sin. Now, this is the same kind of predetermining that would be involved in actualizing a world where everyone freely chooses not to sin. So, if this kind of predetermining destroys genuine moral choice in one world, it destroys it in all.

Edit 2: As to why God must actualize this world if he is all good. 

To display perfect moral goodness, a being must always pick the best possible path of actions when presented with a moral choice. It is my contention that creating a world such as the one I described is the best possible course of action for God to take. 

Edit 3: Crucial to understanding the argument is the notion of [possible worlds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world).

Well, allow me to introduce myself and my throwaway account.

I was raised an atheist from birth. My parents despised religious doctrine. My grandmother on my father's side was an evangelical. When they found out she made me get on my knees and accept Jesus at age three, they threw her out of the house. I haven't seen her since. While I don't remember this event at all, my mother swears that it happened.

Growing up, my community (a suburban town in Connecticut) was pretty open to atheists. Not so much in elementary school where everyone went to Sunday school, but by high school, the ""Jesus freaks"" were in the minority.

I attended a private college in New Hampshire where I majored in English and minored in Philosophy. Mid-Junior year, I converted to Christianity. I won't go into details about what converted me, but I switched to Catholicism. That was the end of my relationship with my family, my friends, and my boyfriend.

That's a very short background for where I come from. I think background is important when it comes to these kinds of debates because then you guys will know I'm talking from a Catholic perspective versus a Calvinist perspective and that I'm relatively new to my religion. As a previous atheist, I think I bring a little something special to the table, as well.

The reason for the throwaway is because, and I don't intend any offense here, Christians are known to be downvote magnets on Reddit. I like my comment karma where it is and I feel engaging in conversations with you will destroy that. I'm not going to let this stop me from answering posts, however.

In the eyes of a missionary, each convert is a redemption of a soul and another saved member of the flock, or however you want to word it.

What if the missionary is talking to a 60 year old man who spent his entire life believing in his cultures version of religion or spirituality?

It probably doesn't need to be covered, but I would cite the following as pretty clear cut problems with the story that are not explained.

Where did the excess water come from and where did it go?

How long did it take Noah to round up all of the animals?

The size of the boat could not hold the volume of the animals which would have had to have been on the boat.

Neither could it have held the weight of the animals.

How did he manage to get all of the marsupials back to Australia and other animals which are only found in certain areas?

How did the animals not attack each other?

How were the animals fed? 40 days is a long time in terms of food.

So nothing happened to the fish?

The logistics of a single man and his family building a quality boat of that size.

I can not remember if the Bible addresses if other humans lived. If our entire population was reduced to Noah's family (and I want to say there is some loophole about others existing like with the who did Cain marry question.) it would be pretty obvious in our record of culture etc. You'd have to believe the descendants of Noah managed to populate the rest of the Earth in the last 5000 years.

Were dinosaurs on the ark? Oh yeah, I brought it up :) Ok, not a serious question.

Like i said above, I don't think anyone here needed a lesson on the story of Noah or issues it brings up. I only said those to highlight the things you would have to look past in order to believe a literal version. The only thing I can assume for someone who literally believes is that their only logic is 'if it's in the bible, it's true'. I'm just curious as to how various types of Christians with various levels of belief address the idea of Noah. Not so much as a specific example or case, but how it relates to other beliefs in the religion. It's just an easy one to address because it is so widely known and a bit outlandish.

In reading over it, I apologize if I sounded offensive, I really don't mean to be. I just can't for the life of me understand and I'm assuming that the confusion isn't really warranted because people don't take it seriously.

There would be no division of Catholics and Protestants. There would be no denominations. Hell, we wouldn't even need a Bible! Everyone would agree. And, thank God, there would be no Christian apologetics. There would be no Atheists (well, maybe a few) or Muslims or Hindus or Buddhists. There would probably be no other religions. The Kingdom of God would be pretty much here because the evidence for the orthodox Christian God would be right here in front of us 24 hours a day every day for the past 2,000 years: a perpetual 33 year old (nail holes and all) alive since the 1st century AD. His presence, as it did for the few who saw him post-resurrection, would make all the difference for the rest of us. And Heaven would be filled to the rafters with believers.

But, instead of sticking around after the resurrection, Jesus made a few random, phantom-like appearances here and there before a measly handful of people (who apparently didn't even know how to write) and then literally vanished in the clouds. What we are left with to base our faith upon is a handful of second-hand (or worse) written accounts of an earthly life that, in fact, lasted no longer than that of a mortal human.

Apparently, Jesus does not find it necessary to appear before any of us. But in order to prove his claims to his disciples, the risen Jesus found it necessary to personally appear before each and every one of them and even show them his nail wounds.

Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” 20 After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. (John 20:19-20)

If the people who knew and traveled with Jesus and ostensibly believed his teachings had to see the risen Christ for themselves in order to believe the resurrection occurred, what are the odds that the average human (who can't even be sure if Jesus even existed or what he taught) is going to believe a specific supernatural event occurred 2,000 years ago? Our inability to do as the disciples did and see for ourselves has resulted in billions of souls, otherwise destined for heaven, condemned to eternal damnation. 

It is no wonder, then, that Jesus said...

""small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."" (Matthew 7:14)

Any definition of such an all-encompassing term as omni-benevolence has to incorporate every relevant action of such a being.  Therefore I posit this as the Christian definition of omni-benevolence.  I posit that no other definition is possible if you consider the actions which God supposedly does.

**Christian Definition: ""A being with infinite kindness, compassion and forgiveness who will shove a red hot iron spear in your stomach for all eternity if you do not believe he has infinite kindness, compassion and forgiveness.""**

The fact that the action of such a being is entirely contradictory of the words describing him is the contradiction I am pointing out.  You can not possibly argue that your god is omni-benevolent.  Instead of arguing such a thing, why do Christians not admit that their god is jealous, vengful, wrathful, hateful and petty?  

Jealous because he cannot allow anything more important than himself.  Wrathful because he has led the genocide of millions and will torture for eternity.  Hateful because torturing for eternity can represent nothing other than hatred.  Petty because he is so concerned about your opinion of him that it causes him to enjoy the eternal torment he inflicts on you.

Is this a God worth worshiping?  No.  Therefore I posit that there is no possibility for me to go to hell from not worshiping a God who I should have worshiped.  Therefore such things do not keep me up at night, and it is very easy to be an atheist.  Essentially I am turning Pascal's wager around and targeting it at the theists.

Shouldn't it keep you up at night, the idea that you worship such a morally reprehensible being?  I know he promised you nice things, but isn't it disgusting what he does to the 'other guys'?

Technically, couldn't you smoke, drink, and eat your way into an early grave with a clear conscience, so long as you believe Jesus died for your sins?

Why stay physically fit through exercise and diet and live to age 100 when you can greatly reduce your life expectancy and get to heaven more quickly? After all, what is an extra few decades of life when compared to eternity - especially when you genuinely believe you're going to heaven?

Some of you may have seen the [thread a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/1iqrec/recruiting_mods/) about recruiting some new mods for a trial period. Some of you upvoted my ideas, so here I am. There are a few things I want to address in this post, and I'd like feedback on some of my ideas. I'm also open to suggestions, so feel free to comment here with what you'd like to see from moderation

1. Mod Transparency

I mentioned in my post in the aformentioned thread that I'd like to keep moderation transparent. There are a few options. The first is keeping a log of all deleted comments that anyone can view. I'm no web design genius, and I don't know how easily this can be done in a subreddit. If anyone knows how, that would be great. Alternatively, we can make a thread now and post links to (if they still work, I'm new at this) or screenshots of comments that we delete, so it's out in the open. Something /r/debatereligion do is have a team of WatchMods who can see mod logs, which is easy enough to do if there's support for that system

2. Post quality

Atheists and Christians alike have complained about post quality here, citing examples of hostility or ad hominem attacks. This is not acceptable. Comments simply containing insults will be deleted. Some of you may be worried about censorship here, and trust me, I'd be the last person to bow to political correctness in this. The basic rule that I'll be following is ""If a post is not conductive to discussion, it will be removed"". For example, a post simply saying ""God is an angry bigoted misogynistic blood God"" will likely be removed. A post starting with that line as an introduction, but then elaborating on each point, providing evidence (for example biblical references), and remaining respectful of those who disagree, will be left alone. 

Also remember that we don't read every single thread. If a post violates our posting guidelines, then please report it or message the mods, or even better both. We don't know about it until you show us. 

3. Repeated common questions

The current sidebar is not as good as I'd like it to be. There is a section linking to neverending debates, but all posts linked are too old to be commented on. It is also not as expansive or detailed as I'd like. I'm open to suggestions on what to include in this list, but my thoughts were along the lines of:

* How do you know Christianity's true?
* Why does God allow evil?
* Why don't Christians follow all Old Testament Commands?
* What would happen if we discovered aliens?
* Why is faith a virtue?

Each would have a bullet point in the sidebar linking to one or two examples of good discussions on the topic, much like now. I would also include in the sidebar either a link to a thread I'll write on posting guidelines, once I've gotten feedback to this, or simply some text in it like there is now. It's my experience that people would rather click links than read text, and so I lean towards that.

Two other ideas that I've seen thrown around but that I'm undecided on: Removing the downvote button, and removing non-Christians who respond to posts addressed to Christians. The problems with them that I see are that people who want to downvote can no matter what we do, and that I've seen atheists make good, informed responses to questions posed at Christians.

EDIT: I've got some great support for removing the downvote button. It's what you guys want, so I'll do what I can to make it happen. Thanks for the feedback!

So please, give some feedback on everything I've said here, and let me know your ideas for improving this sub.

Went to VBS as a kid, youth group grades 7-12, confirmed in grade 10, ""got saved"" younger than I can clearly remember (age 3-5), 20+ years of sunday school and regular church.  Always questioned certain aspects and never became a proper ""evangelical"" because I always found proselytizing to be rationally inconsistent (on Augustine's explanation of primary and secondary revelation, it simply makes no sense; similarly on Paul's discussion of law vs conscience and self-evidence of God; etc) and faith to be deeply personal.  I was so deep in the church that even from a more austere approach I found myself experiencing what I described as prophecy and had what most people would agree was a very vibrant prayer life.  I got my undergraduate degree from a Christian college.  

Around age 18 things started to unravel.  I had conflict with the church over single issues.  For instance, I could not deny the evidence of evolution, but my pastor insisted that orthodoxy required a belief in creationism.  One day at college I learned about fetal alcohol syndrome and my position on abortion did an instant 180, such that I am now rigidly pro-choice; my mother, who volunteered at a pro-life ""crisis pregnancy center"" was pretty upset by this.  Eventually I became a political liberal, and voting for Obama was apparently the final proof to many of my Church friends that I was a proper apostate.  I retained my faith, mostly, for several years after my divorce from the church, but about 18 months ago I acknowledged that I no longer believed in God at all, considering myself an agnostic.  

Recently, some events in my life have led me to reconsider theism.  I am at a point where I believe in God generally and pray occasionally.  I am dating a very devout Christian and she and I have started praying together.  But I disagree with her about the ""political"" questions surrounding Christianity, such as abortion and homosexuality.  

I'm now looking into returning to church, but in my past experience I was simply exasperated with being ""chased out"" over my beliefs.  Specifically, that I am not a biblical literalist; that I am pro-choice; that I reject the apocalyptic interpretation of the book of Revelation; and that I favor gay rights.  Whenever these stances were revealed, it caused tremendous conflict with clergy and fellow congregants.  I would usually leave after it became clear that the pastor viewed me with open hostility and frequently mentioned my disagreements in conversation.  This happened specifically at at least four churches.  

I suspect that part of the problem is I'm simply going to the wrong churches.  

My two questions: Why is the all-or-nothing approach so popular?  Where should I go to be accepted as a Christian (if I do in fact get there; I'm not quite there yet) without having to lie about the details of my beliefs?

There are two reasons that I can see for this. First, that sacrificing an animal pleased God. Second, that sacrificing an animal amounted to a willing punishment of ourselves that made further punishment unnecessary. 

But neither of these explanations is plausible for Jesus. It is hard to imagine that God would be pleased by Jesus's crucifixion. And it is unclear how Jesus's death amounted to much of a loss for us; what did we give up by killing Jesus?

First, for the sake of argument, God and Jesus can be considered the same thing... I know about the trinity and I know that the two are considered separate but all practical purposes they are two manifestations of the same thing. So, we can say that God sent himself to be killed to save mankind.

Second, God created mankind, and man has a sinful nature. Even if you want to blame this sinful nature on some third party agent like the devil or whatever, God created everything, the universe and everything in it... ultimately God is responsible. God is omniscient, he knew what he was creating when he created it, so God intentionally created mankind knowing that we would be sinful. God made us sinful.

So, god made us sinful, then flooded the earth and killed all of us because we were sinful, then we became sinful again, so god sent himself to be tortured and killed and somehow this forgives all of us for our sins? That's the gist of it anyway, I don't want to argue irrelevant details.

Even if that doesn't bother you, exactly how does god spilling gods own blood do anything? Why is THAT what was required to forgive us for our sins? Couldn't god just forgive us for our sins without doing that? Doesn't it seem archaic to you, that blood must be spilled for some reason?

A simple exercise in logic shows us that omniscience and free will are mutually exclusive. If *any* being is omniscient, this means that free will can not exist. 

A simple analogy that explains this fairly well:

In the future, your great great grandson builds a Sims-type simulation complete with millions of little humanoid characters who, unaware of their matrix-like existence, are programmed by the boy to go about their lives, under the impression that they have free will to do as they wish. 

In scenario A, this boy has written every line of code in the entire program and is considered all-knowing when it comes to the simulation. He knows everything about the program and he knows what will happen and what won't happen. With regards to the program, he is omniscient. In this scenario, because he knows everything about his simulation, the simulated characters, who think they have free will, obviously do not. 

In scenario B, the boy has created a sophisticated artificial intelligence where the simulated characters really do have the ability to make their own decisions and choose their own paths. The boy kick-started the program but since it began, he has no knowledge of what will happen because the characters have free will. 

What this analogy shows is that for something (a God for example) to truly *know all*, there can not truly exist free will. If free will *does* exist, there can be no data from which a omniscient source could draw from. 

I am not really sure what denominations hold that God is omniscient; I had always just assumed that all Abraham monotheistic branches believed this.

1338819802.0,12,self.DebateAChristian,uk7tf,Old Testament = a series of books centered around the main character who is likely the most powerful and evil super-villain in all of literature.,MisterFlibble,21,9,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/uk7tf/old_testament_a_series_of_books_centered_around/,"As Christians (and for Jews as well), it may be difficult to step back and **take a look at the Old Testament from a non-christian and literary point of view**, but I'm asking you to try your best here.

First picture the stereotypical mad scientist.  Living along in the darkness, needing something to show affection for.  This is usually satisfied by the creation of life in most old-fashioned horror stories.  Frankenstein made his monster.  Dr Cortner, in *The Brain the Wouldn't Die* kept his lover's head alive on a plate after a horrible accident.  In these examples, and many others, the creators are driven mad.  Usually, the antagonist is the main character who combs the city looking for victims to harvest for body parts.

Similarly, the Old Testament starts with a genius entity, so genius in fact, he's said to be omniscient.  Only there is darkness, and it loves nothing as there is nothing to love.  So it creates a universe.  It's own world, complete with living creatures and people.

Now, I'm not going to go through the whole testament story by story, but eventually, the main deity character int he mythology goes on to kill millions of the people he's created for various selfish reasons.  

The first few commandments he communicates to his creation are purely narcissistic and jealous.  Throughout the Old Testament, we see this god punishing those, mainly for questioning or doubting it.  He goes on to flood the entire planet because the people he created aren't behaving to his standard.

He destroys an entire city, for consisting entirely of rapists, sure, but he also destroys one of the victims of the incident (Lot's wife) for simply turning back to look at it when God told her not to.

It seems that above all else, this character values a strict obedience to him.  He even asks for things such as the slaughter of Abraham's son just to test Abraham's loyalty.

If the bible wasn't read with the predetermination that the character is some all-knowing, loving, just, and forgiving entity, then it would appear like the super-villain it is.  If it wasn't already the case, that millions of people actually believe the character to be real and deserving of fear, would it still be perceived as a ""good guy""?

Then there's the absurdity in the lack of limitations of this being.  There is literally nothing that can stop this thing.  As illustrated countless times throughout the saga, any that oppose, or even just doubt the decisions of this deity get killed.  There's no fight or battle.  There's not even an uprising to overthrow this tyrannical ruler of the universe because the people therein are simply too scared and/or powerless to do so by comparison.

In short, the Old Testament can be summed up as such:

*Once upon a time, there was a powerful being that created a universe with a bunch of living things and people.  Any time the people didn't do what he liked, he killed them or tortured them.  To be continued. (Or ""The End"" if you're Jewish)*

1337938324.0,12,self.DebateAChristian,u48zn,Why should I believe God is good when there is so much evidence to the contrary.,ThisIsMyRedditLogin,15,3,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/u48zn/why_should_i_believe_god_is_good_when_there_is_so/,"I remember back in my Pentecostal days the Pastor used to say ""God is good"" and the congregation would respond ""all the time"", like some kind of mantra.  

I'm convinced the God of the Bible isn't a good God.  The evidence is overwhelming.  Before I get to that evidence, I would like to say at the outside that I have debated the issue of God's morality many times on Reddit and other forums and have yet to see a convincing argument that God is good.  Whenever I present examples from the Bible on the sheer destructive nature of God, Christians will avoid answering directly and instead accuse me of judging God.  Here's an example from a debate I got into yesterday - http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/u2152/the_love_of_god_does_not_cancel_the_wrath_of_god/c4runre?context=3.  This is the bog standard response I get whenever I question the goodness of God.  

So let's see some evidence for why I don't believe God is good.  Firstly, the Garden of Eden.  I am convinced that God deliberately stuck a spanner in the works of his own creation.  He sticks Adam and Eve in a lush Garden and forbids them from eating the fruit of the nearby Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.  Now, the first problem with this is that we live on a big planet.  God could have put that tree anywhere!  We also have a second problem though, because God stuck a talking snake in the Garden, or allowed it in there.  I am, of course, assuming that God is omnipotent and omniscience (having knowledge of the past, present and future), attributes which Christians always assign to God.  So here we have a deity who has deliberately and with foreknowledge set his creation up for failure.  We all know how the story goes.  

Next up is the Flood.  Christians will often tell me that mankind was pure evil at this time, quoting to me the following;

&gt;Genesis 6:5-8

&gt;5  The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6 And the Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. 7 So the Lord said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.” 8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.

But when I reply that innocent children and babies drowned in the flood, I either get no direct response to that statement, or I am met with the ""man is not qualified to judge God"" response.  If there was a Flood as described in Genesis (and the archaeological and geological evidence says ""no""), then we can be reasonably confident that innocent children and babies would have drowned too.  

Thirdly is the Exodus and the murderous conquest of Canaan.  God himself hardens Pharaoh's heart, effectively giving the man no choice but to disobey God.  This culminates in God killing **every** firstborn son of the Egyptians.  So we already have two examples of God fully supporting abortion.  Pro-lifers beware, because I will always use this against you.  God kills babies, so do not judge a woman who is not ready to have a child, or has been raped and does not want to raise her rapist's baby.  

God's crimes throughout Israel's wilderness wanderings are many, not least of which is that on several occasions God slaughtered large numbers of his **own** people.  Numbers chapter 16 is one such example of the psychotic nature of God.  Korah tries to rebel against Moses, which culminates in Korah and his family getting swallowed up by the earth and another 250 people getting burned to death (Numbers 16:1-35).  But this isn't the fun part.  The next day, the Israelites heard about what had happened and were understandably upset.  They complained to Moses and Aaron about their people being killed (Numbers 16:41).  What is God's response against this complaint?  He sends a plague among them.  What is surprising about this part of the story is that even Moses and Aaron are appalled by God's temper tantrum.  Moses sends Aaron out into the ""congregation"" with incense in order to make atonement (Numbers 16:46-47).  Apparently God can be appeased by nice smells.  Sadly, Aaron wasn't quick enough and 14,700 people die as a result of God not being able to have a nice smell fill his nostrils (verse 49).  

Another example of God's complete lack of mercy, and love of killing babies, is the case of David's adultery.  In 2 Samuel chapter 11 we find the story of how David fell in love with Bathsheba and committed adultery with her.  David got her pregnant and ends up having to kill her loyal but rather stupid husband (David, rather comically, tries twice to get Uriah to go home and spend the night with his wife).  With Uriah having died on the front lines, David takes Bathsheba as his wife and she bears him a son.  In 2 Samuel 12, God sends a prophet to David to rebuke him and David admits he sinned (2 Samuel 12:13).  Interestingly, God forgives David of his sin, but decides to punish David's son;

&gt; 2 Samuel 12:13-14

&gt;13  David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the Lord.” And Nathan said to David, “The Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die. 14 Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord, the child who is born to you shall die.”

David spends several days praying for the child, but to no avail (verse 16).  In verse 18 we are told of the baby's death.  

In one debate with a Christian on this, he tried to convince me that God did not cause the child's death.  I ended up having to go through the entire chapter proving from the verses therein that God said he would kill the child and that the child had died as a result of God's punishment.  

Another person responded to me by saying that David's son went to heaven after he died, so it all worked out in the end.  So I replied that murdering babies must be okay because they all go to heaven, and I brought up the topic of abortion again.  He did not respond after that.

Another example of God's good nature is the death of Ezekiel's wife.  As in the case of David, God first told Ezekiel that he would kill Ezekiel's wife **before** she died.  But, in this case, Ezekiel was **not** being punished for a sin.  God killed Ezekiel's wife simply because he could.  

&gt; Ezekiel 24:15-18

&gt;15 The word of the Lord came to me: 16  “Son of man, behold, **I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you at a stroke**; yet you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears run down. 17 Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your shoes on your feet; do not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.” 18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, **and at evening my wife died**. And on the next morning I did as I was commanded.

Sickeningly, Ezekiel is not even allowed to mourn her death.  Not even to cry.  

I believe the God of the Bible is evil.  He *says* he is good, and he says he loves us, but his actions speak otherwise.  From the Bible, it is clear that he deliberately and knowingly usurped his own creation, causing humanity to sin and bringing suffering into this world.  Since then, God has watched that suffering go on whilst doing nothing to alleviate it.  

This God also designed hell, with the full foreknowledge that he would shove humans there when they die.  The creation of hell is the invention of a depraved and sadistic mind.  Some Christians like to cop out and say we send ourselves there, or that God never intended humans to end up in hell.  To the first, I argue that even if that is true, God still designed hell and is thus still an evil sadist.  To the second group I argue that if they believe that God never intended humans to end up in hell, he shouldn't have made it.  I also point out to these folks that if they believe their God is omniscient and has foreknowledge of future events then God could not possibly have created hell without knowing beforehand that he would be putting humans there.  

There are other Christians who have tried to convince me that hell is **not** a place of eternal punishment and non-believers simply die while Christians go to heaven to eternally sing sweet songs to God about how important and nice he is.  I would like to remind such Christians that Jesus often promised that non-believers would go to a place where there is ""wailing and gnashing of teeth"" and where the ""worm does not die"" (whatever that means).  I would also like to remind them of the ""rich man and Lazarus"".  The rich man was in a place of torment.  It is fairly clear from the New Testament that God has a nasty punishment in store for those who **don't** want to eternally sing sweet songs to God about how important and nice he is.

I'm presuming that most people will believe, as I did when I was a Christian, that these people do not go to hell.They were never given the opportunity to accept Jesus so cannot be punished for not accepting him.

2.If that is the case then by spreading the word of God,arent you putting people in danger of going to hell?If you don't do a good job and they reject Jesus,they're going to hell.Whereas if you had never told them about Jesus,they would be safe.It seems to me if you really believe in hell, spreading the word of God is an extremely reckless and dangerous thing to do.

Among the butchered were many thousands of innocent women, children and elderly. Defending such actions is rightfully considered grotesque. 

That was recent though - apparently genocides become more excusable the further back in time you go. If you go back far enough, even gentle people might say it was a good thing. This is certainly the case with many Christians, whose holy book describes the mass murder of the Canaanites. The book of Joshua tells us of God specifically ordering the destruction and annihilation of entire cities of people. When I've asked Christians about this the responses generally fall into three categories:

1. Ignorance - they're simply unaware of this part of the Bible.
2. Error - the bizarre claim from Christians that certain parts of the Bible are wrong. Prime example of cherrypicking. This view needs a lot more justification than ""the good parts are genuine and the bad parts aren't, because the Christian God is loving""
3. Justification - the most disturbing. There are actually a large number of Christians who not only accept this as a historical genocide, but believe it was a good thing. They say the Canaanites had horrible practises such as child sacrifice. Anyone whose had a glancing look at the history of genocide will see the victims are always portrayed as sub-human by the perpetrators. The Hutu aligned militias in Rwanda referred to the Tutsi as corrupted 'inyenzi'. Cockroaches. Even if child sacrifice was true, this in no way justifies exterminating the population. That much should be obvious.


It confuses me how so many Christians can go through perverse mental acrobatics to justify this shit, when the obvious answer eludes them. This stuff is fucked up because it's man-made. Their religion is man-made, and it's only by an accident of their birth that they're justifying this brand of bullshit over some other brand of bullshit.

I'm not just here to rant though. I would like to discuss this. For all I know there could be an explanation for this, perhaps a solid reason to consider Joshua not genuine, perhaps a solid justification for considering it allegorical (though this raises problems of its own). I won't compromise my position on genocide though, that simply cannot be justified. I think the obvious reason for the brutality there is that Christianity (and all Abrahamic religions) are man made.

That's fine, honestly the thought of kissing a guy is disgusting to me, so is eating sushi.  As long as no one is forcing me to do either, I don't care if other people partake.

The most common argument I see for Christians political stance against marriage is that it negatively affects the idea/concept/whatever of marriage.

*My question is this, by what specific manner does gay marriage affect heterosexual marriage?*

1.  Does God think less of marriage?  Is he so upset by the unity of same sex couples that the overall value for marriage in God's eyes decreases so that each 'true' marriage loses a tiny amount of value to God when a gay couple marries?  

2.  If God doesn't accept the marriage as 'true', then why do Christians care?  If you believe it doesn't count to God, then it's a non-issue in terms of religion. 

3.  Is God upset with Christians for allowing these abominations?  If so, would this not be paying for the sin of another?

4.  In the Bible, even a raped virgin is not allowed to divorce her husband.  Considering the amount of time spent speaking against divorce compared to the few lines against homosexuality, wouldn't divorce hurt heterosexual marriage more than homosexual marriage?  At least the homosexual couple isn't creating children only to grow up in a divorced household (not that it's always bad, just making a point.)  

5.  Is a homosexual couple adopting a child worse than the child staying with parents who didn't want them, or could not provide for them?  

For me, it comes down to just a few things.

If gay marriage does not directly devalue each heterosexual marriage, does not force others to pay for their sins, and can be achieved through a civil union outside of any religious affiliation...

... then if you're politically opposing gay marriage you are just attempting to deny them the civil rights of marriage.  It's not about religion at this point, you are 

Marriage is not a privilege, it's not something you earn, and honestly the Bible expresses some pretty horrible ideas about it.  

*If you're using the Bible to actively prevent the marriage of gays then you aren't making a religious argument, you're making a civil rights argument through an interpretation of religious belief.*

If I make an argument for genocide by quoting the bible, I assume you would say it's not a Christian argument, just me using the Bible to support my desire to commit genocide.  How is this any different?

And for what?  What do you earn when you oppress them?  Will God reward you for preventing gays from seeing their loved one in the hospital?  For denying them tax benefits? 

Would you keep gay people from dating?  For dating for their entire lives?  From sharing a savings account to putting their names on a mortgage?  I assume not, but you would keep them from saying a few words in court and gaining the rights that our country gives to married people.

The rights that our country will give to Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindu, Scientologists, Pagans, Wiccans, devil worshippers, murders, rapists, child abusers, thieves, and almost every potential sin.  We should alloy these people to marry but not gays.... ridiculous, and I challenge you to state a specific answer beyond 'the bible says so.'  By what mechanism are gays hurting Christians or heterosexual marriage?

Heck, maybe the question should have been, why don't you care that every other religion can have members marry in the country?

I concluded that I would probably believe it was a ceiling with lights in it.

I then did some more research and, in fact, that is what people believed at the time. They thought that the sky was a firmament that had the stars, sun, and moon embedded in it. The usage of the word star really just meant ""light in the ceiling."" An ancient version of the Truman show.

I was sitting by the ocean yesterday thinking about this, and I simultaneously had the thought of how comforting it would be to believe in god. To know that the decisions I make are leading somewhere, to know that it is all part of plan. Instead, I know there is no safety net, the decisions I make are scarily real and permanent. I am forging my own path, free to fuck up any number of ways, no deity to pray to for comfort.

But in that moment, with both of those thoughts in my head, I really tried to imagine what it would be like to live when the bible authors lived. What it would feel like to look up at the sky and believe that it is nothing more than an unreachable wall.

Instantly, I understood the origin of religion. Rather, I felt the origin of religion. It became easy to see why and how Genesis was written the way it was, most certainly to be taken as literal. For them, the world was so incredibly small, the scientific substance of which so alien, that using a god as an explanation was certainly the most reasonable thing to believe at the time.

Anyways, I'm not sure if this belongs here, but it felt like the right place to put it. I had never really tried to put myself in the reality of someone living during that time.

And I will attempt to lay out the case of why it makes at least as much sense that God is evil as that he is good.  Why is God an patient father and not a bored kid playing the Sims?

First, I want to define an evil God in order to head off any claims that an all powerful god can make anything he wants to be ""good"".  As a working definition, I define an ""Evil God"" as a supernatural being that wishes to cause harm and suffering to humanity.

I would like to begin by pointing out that all ""evidence"" for the omni-benevolence of God comes from sources that are supposedly either directly from or inspired by God.  There is no way to say that God couldn't have said one thing and secret intend to act evil.

Furthermore, even with in the texts supposedly given from God, he performs very few acts that reduce suffering for humanity, in fact most of his acts increase the suffering of humanity.  The entirety of human suffering is a direct result of God cursing Adam and Eve, even if it was in retaliation for the original sin it increased human suffering.  Gods next important act was drowning the entirety of humanity save one family.  Fast forwarding through the rest of the OT we see God generally performing wanton acts of genocide and terror against anyone who displeases him (and sometimes innocent children).

Now to the tricky part: the NT and Jesus, meek and mild.  For all the barbarity of the OT, Jesus has a fairly progressive message.  However, this does nothing to proof Gods benevolence; to the contrary Jesus works very well into the plans of an evil god.  All earthly suffering has one hindrance, humans consent to endure it.  Almost all beings who suffer have it within their power to end their life.  In order to counter this a being would have to give his creation hope.  And I believe that most Christians would agree that more than anything Jesus attempts to be a message of hope.  It is the promises of Jesus that allows many to endure great hardship.  Which would merely give god more time to cause suffering.

Next, is the fact that religion helps to hinder human progress both scientific and social.  The only real challenge in the US to evolution and equal rights for gays is Christianity.  In this way an evil God hinders attempts for humans to help themselves.

Last, is the fact that all claims to divine revelation and personal interaction with god could just as easily come from an evil god.  Furthermore, even the most devout Christian must admit that if god has absolute control over the fate of man, that he could just as easily cast all of the devout into hell and only allow rapist and murders into heaven.


In conclusion, there is no evidence for the benevolence of god.  All of Christianity could just as easily come from an evil god.  Believing the Bible reflects god's true nature because it says it reflects god's true nature is as convincing as the statement ""Martel732 is the world's greatest lover (which is true, I read it on a forum somewhere)""

51 At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split 52 and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. 53 They came out of the tombs after Jesus’ resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people. (Matthew 27)

Josephus, who wrote a history of Jerusalem both prior to and after her fall, i.e., forty years after the death of Jesus, knew of Jesus but nothing of this raising of many and appearing to many. Of this greatest of all miracles, not a rumor appears in the works of Josephus or of any other ancient author. Surely at least one of the many raised out of those many emptied tombs was still alive just prior to Josephus's time, amazing many. Or at least many who had seen those many saints were still repeating the tale. Although people may have doubted that Jesus raised a few people while he was still alive and although ""some doubted"" Jesus' own resurrection (Matt. 28:17), who could fail to have been impressed by many risen saints appearing to many? How also could Peter have neglected to mention them in his Jerusalem speech a mere fifty days after they ""appeared to many in the holy city""? Surely their appearance must have been foremost on everyone's mind. So why didn't Paul mention such a thing in his letters, our earliest sources? Why did the women who visited the ""empty tomb"" on Sunday morning not take notice that many other tombs were likewise open? Why didn't the visitors to Jesus' tomb mention that they had met or seen many raised saints in that vicinity, meeting them on the way to Jesus' tomb or on the way back to town? Why did the apostles disbelieve the first reports of Jesus' resurrection when a mass exit from the tombs had accompanied his resurrection? Why didn't Matthew know how many raised saints there were? Why couldn't he name a single one or a single person to whom they had appeared?

1 Kings 8:63 - Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the LORD: twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the LORD. 

It seems as though Yahweh loves animals about as much as he loves humans.

And what was the point of slaughtering all of these animals if he was just going to come down eventually and offer himself as the ultimate sacrifice? Yahweh, Mr. ""I exist outside of time"" could have established his final covenant (the one Paul made up) from the beginning of time.

He could have said to Adam and Eve:

""Look, you assholes, I know in advance you are going to sin because I made you to sin. 

So here's what I'm going to do:

As soon as you commit your first sin...

And believe me you *will* sin because I'm sending my doppelganger, Satan, down there ahead of me to make sure it happens. But I digress. 

...As soon as you commit your first sin (which will be something so incredibly petty you won't believe it) I'm going to come down there as a human and let you kill me. My death for the weekend will serve as atonement for the sin I manipulated you into committing. And for this you must be eternally grateful and acknowledge my wonderfulness through all the generations until I come back and kill all of the people who don't believe this story.""

Why didn't Yahweh just cut to the chase and establish his final covenant right off the bat in Eden, or immediately outside of Eden or sometime during Adam's lifetime? 

Is it because he is so gratified by the death and dismemberment of animals and the smell of burning animal flesh that he wanted to enjoy that sensation for a few hundred years before he came down here and arranged to have himself killed?

20 Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it. 21 **The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma** and said in his heart: “Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done. (Genesis 8:20-21)

It seems that the God of love is also eagerly awaiting the day when he can enjoy the smell of burning human flesh.

""I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!"" (Luke 12:49 )

Jesus also wants Christians to enjoy this spectacle.

22 “As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me,” declares the LORD, “so will your name and descendants endure. 23 From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me,” says the LORD. 24 **“And they will go out and look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me**; the worms that eat them will not die, the fire that burns them will not be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.” (Isaiah 66)",,False,,t5_2ryd5,True,,violet brackets,True,t3_fqen4,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/fqen4/why_didnt_yahweh_just_cut_to_the_chase_and/,

And according to a United Nations World Conference Against Racism document, he also ""declared war against all non-Christians throughout the world"".

""In 1452, Nicholas V issued the papal bull Dum Diversas, granting the King of Portugal the right to reduce any ""Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers"" to hereditary slavery. Dum Diversas legitimised the colonial slave trade that begun around this time with the expeditions by Henry the Navigator to find a sea route to India, which were financed with African slaves. This approval of slavery was reaffirmed and extended in his Romanus Pontifex of 1455.

It is argued that collectively the two bulls issued by Nicholas gave the Portuguese the rights to acquire slaves along the African coast by force or trade. The concessions given in them were confirmed by bulls issued by Pope Calixtus III ""Inter Caetera quae"" (1456), Sixtus IV ""Aeterni regis"" (1481) and Leo X (1514) and they became the models for subsequent bulls issued by Pope Alexander VI : ""Eximiae devotionis"" (May 3, 1493), ""Inter Caetera"" (May 4, 1493) and ""Dudum Siquidem (September 23, 1493) when he conferred similar rights to Spain relating to the newly discovered lands in the Americas.[7]""

My questions to you are as follows: once they have entered heaven, do human souls still possess free will?  Are they still capable of sin?  If so, and if they do sin and remain unrepentant in their sin, will they be 'kicked out' of heaven and sent to hell?

How does this argument not refute itself?

I remember Dawkins brought up this argument in a debate once and he was met with the answer ""I don't believe in a created god"". Which avoids the point, we're not asking ""who created god"", we're just showing you that the argument doesn't stand on it's own feet.

My basic question is this: why would a loving, all-knowing, all-powerful God need to brutalize an innocent baby and leave it to die slowly from it's injuries over a period of a week? Some people believe that God physically struck the infant, pounding it with His fists, other Christians interpret the passage as though God infected the helpless baby with some sort of disease. I personally find these discussions irrelevant and I encourage people not to be easily distracted by such minutia. I believe the most important fact is that a helpless, innocent baby was killed and the most important question is if a less savage, blood-thirsty option was available to an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving and magical God?

My core concern is this:

**If you believe that God is loving, why would He need to attack and kill a helpless, innocent baby to achieve His goals?**

Surely a loving, all-powerful and all-knowing God would have the wherewithal to solve His issues without resorting to killing babies? He would not be constrained by imagination, time, space or resources. For example, God could have made His voice so loud and compelling that King David (and perhaps everyone else) was absolutely compelled to comply. Also, I believe the argument of free will is invalid because what is more manipulative than killing a parent's baby?

So Christians, what do you think?

Was God correct to kill an innocent baby, or did an all-knowing, all-powerful, loving God have the power, imagination, love and resources to achieve His plans without killing babies?

Please consider your answers carefully and please do not attempt to rush to justify murder in the name of your God.

**TL;DR: Why did God need to resort to brutalizing King David's innocent baby to death to achieve His goals? Was the all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God somehow incapable or unwilling to solve His problems without savaging an infant? God can do anything, why would He need to attack and kill a helpless baby?**

**EDIT #1: I have noticed that, with many question that I consider to be difficult, Christians become easily distracted by anything and everything other than answering the question.

Can we create a thread here for all of the questions about creationism, and have it put into the FAQ?",temoignage,21,11,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/1eee2t/is_anybody_else_tired_of_the_same_questions_being/,"**TL;DR - Let's create a thread for all questions regarding the first eleven chapters of Genesis.**


I am an agnostic theist, and in this post I will discuss my point of view according to Genesis in relation to history and science.

**-**

**-**

**GENESIS AND HISTORY** **--**


All events in the first eleven chapters of Genesis long predate Moses, and are called the **primeval period (chs. 1-11).**  Further, there are important **parallels** between chapters 1-11 and stories of ancient times from **Mesopotamia** (creation/flood stories are not unique to the Jewish culture).  Some argue that since the other Mesopotamian myths are called just that-- *myths* -- that the first 11 chapers of Genesis should find their place in that name, as well.  Some argue that the **patriarchs (chs. 12-50)** are legends with only loose connections to actual people and events.  


**In order to sort through these issues, the first question that we must address is whether or not Genesis claims to record ""history.""**


First we must have a clear definition of **history**.  In ordinary language, the word simply refers to an account of **events that the author believes to have happened**. 


**In and of itself, the label ""history"" makes no comment about whether the account is complete, unbiased, free from divine activity, in strict chronological sequence, or with or without figurative and imaginative (mytholgical) elements.**  With this definition, we can obviously see that Genesis aims to record *actual* events, rather than mythological ones.  It explains how the Jewish ancestors came to be in Egypt; the genealogies connect Jacob to his children with ancient generations going back to Adam and Eve.  Further, the book is in **narrative prose**, whose main function in the Bible is to **recount history.**


The similarities between Genesis 1-11 to the other Mesopotamian stories actually support the conclusion that these chapters intend to record history.  The Mesopotamian stoies clearly aim to celebrate actual historical events, but they do so in ""mythological"" terms.  **The Genesis stories are fundamentally different**, however, in that they recount the activities of the one true God.  **Recounting these events like history separated the Israelite narrative from those of the rest of Mesopotamia, serving the ultimate purpose of building religious and cultural identity.**  Genesis, like the Mesopotamian stories, provides the opening act of a grand narrative that conveys a **particular worldview**.  In order to provide the **necessary grounding** for this worldview, the author **needed to use real events** (albeit theologically interpreted).  In this way **Genesis aims to provide a true record of these events, in harmony with the biblical worldview.**  That worldview includes the notions that Yahweh, the deity of Israel, is the universal Creator of heaven and earth, who made mankind to know and love him; that all mankind fell through the disobedience of Adam and Eve; and that God chose Israel to be the vehicle by which all mankind would receive the blessing of knowing the true God.  **Clearly, that worldview requires the events of Genesis to be historical.**

At the same time, it is not possible to answer all questions arising from Genesis.  For example, faithful interpreters of the book disagree on just how long Adam lived before Abraham, or even how long the creation period lasted.  There is not enough material here for a complete life of Abraham.  Even the name of the pharaoh that Joseph served is not mentioned.  It is possible through archaeological research to locate some of the Genesis events in ancient Near Eastern history, at least in order to offer a plausible scenario for them.  **But it remains true that Moses has not sought to provide a comprehensive retelling of ancient days; his purpose lay elsewhere.**

**-**
**-**

**GENESIS AND SCIENCE** **--**


**The relation of Genesis to science is primarily a question of how one reads the accounts of creation and falls (chs. 1-3) and of the flood (chs. 6-9).**  What kind of ""days"" does Genesis 1 describe?  How long ago is this supposed to have happened?  Were all species created as they are now?  Were Adam and Eve real people?  Are all people descended from them?  How much of the earth did Noah's flood cover?  How much of an impact did it have on geological formations?


Faithful interpreters have offered arguments for taking the creation week of Genesis 1 as a regular week with ordinary days **(the ""calender day"" reading)**; or as a sequence of geological ages **(the ""day-age"" reading)**; ir as God's ""work days,"" analogous to a human workweek **(the ""analogical days"" view)**; or as a literary device to portray the creation week *as if* it were a workweek, but without concern for temporal sequence **(the ""literary framework"" view)**.  Some have suggested that Genesis 1:2, ""the earth was without form and void,"" describes a condition that resulted from Satan's primeval rebellion, which preceded creation **(""gap theory"")**.  **There have been other readings as well, but these five are the most common.**


**None of these views requires denying that Genesis 1 is historical, so long as the discussion in the above section on ""Genesis and History"" is kept in mind.**  Each of these readings can be squared with other biblical passages that reflect on creation (**Exodus 20:11**, ""in six days the Lord made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day"": this passage echoes Genesis 1:1-2-3, the word ""day"" here need mean only what it means in Genesis 1, therefore it does not *require* an ordinary-day interpretation, nor does it *preclude* an ordinary-day interpretation).  **The arguments for and against these different views involve detailed treatment of the Hebrew (going beyond the question of the meaning of ""day""), and assessing these arguments would go beyond the goal of my initial post (we can talk about them in the comments).**


A further question involves the genealogies: do they describe direct father-to-son descent, or do they allow for gaps?  The Hebrew term ""father"" can be used of a distant ancestor, and ""son"" can refer to a distant descendant.  Likewise, ""to father"" can mean ""to become the ancestor of."" **In other words, the conventions for Hebrew genealogies allow for gaps; genealogies are not given to indicate a length of time.**


These issues become less pressing when it is recalled that **no biblical passage ever actually purports to count up the length of the creation week (outside of Exodus 20:11) and that no biblical author adds up the life spans in genealogies to compute absolute time.**


Should Genesis 1 be called a ""scientific account?""  Again, we need a careful definition.  Does Genesis 1 record a true account of the origin of the material universe? To that question, **the answer must be no.**


The account in Genesis is well cast for its main purpose, **which was to enable a community of nomadic shepherds in the Sinai desert to celebrate the boundless creative goodness of the Creator**; it does not say why e.g., a spider is different from a snake, nor does it comment on what genetic relationship there might be between various creatures.  At the same time, when the passage is received according to its purpose (to build religious identity, and nationalism), it shapes a worldview in which science is at home.  **This is a concept of a world that a good and wise God made, perfectly suited for humans to enjoy, and to rule, and explore.**

**FAQ ABOUT GENESIS**


&gt;What kind of ""days"" does Genesis 1 describe? 

The ""days in Genesis are not described in the book-- but if the book is read according to its purpose, then when it comes to the creation story we must trust science, and understand that the formation of the earth took place about 4.56 billion years ago from the accretion of solar nebula.


&gt;How long ago is this supposed to have happened? 


The creation story in Genesis offers no account of how long ago this took place, and so it is important to read Genesis (and all books of the Bible) according to the intention of its author which was **not to provide a historical account, but to separate the Israelites from the rest of Mesopotamian cultures.**  To answer this question, it is important to refer to good science, and trust that as far as we know the earth was formed roughly 4.56 billion years ago.

&gt;Were all species created as they are now? 


The Genesis account does not address the question, although it does separate animals from livestock to creeping things, and from land animals to aquatic animals.  This is secondary to the main purpose of the Genesis account, and so **we must trust in good science and the Theory of Evolution.**


&gt;Were Adam and Eve real people? Are all people descended from them? 


Although the writing style of Genesis would imply that Adam and Eve were historical figures, and that we are all their descendants, this is secondary to the main purpose of Genesis which is not to answer these questions; we must defer to science.


&gt;How much of the earth did Noah's flood cover? How much of an impact did it have on geological formations?


Given that flood stories in Mesopotamia are not rare (Epic of Gilgamesh), one can come to two conclusions.  One conclusion could be that because of the multiplicity of myths, perhaps there was a massive flood, perhaps global, or perhaps localized in Mesopotamia.  This is unsupported by geological evidence, however, and so the second conclusion, that **the Israelites wanted their own flood story, as the other cultures had, to validate their religion.**  Other Mesopotamian flood stories have uncanny similarities to the Genesis account of the flood.  The differences lie in the intentions and motivation of God to cause the flood (or gods), and the number of deities.  This would imply that the flood narrative is another tool of cultural separation.

**What’s the Difference Between the Old Covenant &amp; New Covenant in the Bible?**

For a long time I was confused about the difference between what the Bible calls the “Old Covenant” and the “New Covenant.” I imagine many readers still struggle with some confusion between the two.

This post has been made in hopes of clearing up that confusion.

The Old Covenant was in effect during the time before Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection when the Jews were living under the Mosaic Law, or, the Old Law, and is associated with the Old Testament and the leadership of Moses.

The New Covenant went into effect after Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection that fulfilled the requirements of the Old Covenant and Old Law, and is associated with the New Testament and the leadership of Jesus.

When I was in college a professor of mine named Dr. Phil Thompson presented my class with a handout put together by a man named Jack McKinney. I’d like to share the contents of that handout with you today as I’ve found them to be very helpful.

Jack McKinney uses 2 Corinthians 3 to compare/contrast the Old Covenant to the New Covenant in a way that really helped clear up a lot of confusion for me … check it out:

The Old Covenant vs. The New Covenant

Jeremiah 31:31-34

Old Covenant – Moses as Minister (2 Corinthians 3:13-15; John 1:17; Hebrews 3:5)
New Covenant - Jesus’ Disciples as Ministers (2 Corinthians 3:6; John 16:12-15)

Old Covenant - A Covenant of the Letter (2 Corinthians 3:6)
New Covenant - A Covenant of the Spirit (2 Corinthians 3:6-8)

Old Covenant - A Covenant which Kills (2 Corinthians 3:6)
New Covenant - A Covenant which Gives Life (2 Corinthians 3:6 – literally “makes alive”)

Old Covenant - A Ministry of Death (2 Corinthians 3:7)
New Covenant - A Ministry of Life (2 Corinthians 3:6)

Old Covenant - A Ministry of Condemnation (2 Corinthians 3:9)
New Covenant - A Ministration of Righteousness (2 Corinthians 3:9)

Old Covenant - A Covenant Written with Ink (2 Corinthians 3:3)
New Covenant - A Covenant Written with the Spirit of the Living God (2 Corinthians 3:3)

Old Covenant - A Covenant Written on Stone (2 Corinthians 3:3-7)
New Covenant - A Covenant Written on the Heart of Man (2 Corinthians 3:3; Jeremiah 31:33; Ezekiel 11:19-20; 36:26)

Old Covenant - A Covenant which came with Glory (2 Corinthians 3:7; Exodus 34:29-35)
New Covenant - A Covenant which came with the Greatest Glory (2 Corinthians 3:8-11)

Old Covenant - A Covenant whose Glory was Passing/Fading (2 Corinthians 3:7)
New Covenant - A Covenant whose Glory Continues to Shine (2 Corinthians 3:18)

Old Covenant - A Veiled or Covered Glory (2 Corinthians 3:12-16)
New Covenant - An Unveiled, Ever-Increasing Glory (2 Corinthians 3:18)

Old Covenant - A Covenant Destined to be Done Away (2 Corinthians 3:11; Hebrews 7:12, 8:13, 10:9)
New Covenant - A Covenant Destined to Last Forever (2 Corinthians 3:11; Hebrews 13:20)

McKinney goes on to note:

It was not merely the glory (GREEK: Doxa; cf. English “doxology”) which was transient in nature, but the Old Covenant itself. A close reading of 2 Corinthians 3:11 makes that clear, though some commentators have missed this. It is especially clear from 2 Corinthians 3:7, where Paul speaks of the “ministry that brought death … engraved in letters on stone” coming with glory (NIV). It does not make sense to say that the glory of the Old Covenant “came with glory.” To understand this chapter, one must turn back to the situation in Exodus 34, and even then Paul’s argument may seem a bit strange to us. Still, his line of reasoning in one that is quite acceptable to that of the rabbinical interpretation of his time. It is not, of course, as if the Old Testament were of no value to the Christian. As the tutor or schoolmaster whose purpose was to lead to Christ, it has tremendous value for us, but the fact that “now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law” (Galatians 3:19-23, 25; 2:19-21).

I’ve retyped the original handout by Jack McKinney as it was given to me with a couple of minor changes (mostly typos), and encourage any serious Bible student to download and study it.

That leads me to the question: what should we do with the teachings surrounding the Old Covenant today? Should we simply ignore them, or are they still applicable?

I really appreciate the way Mark Driscoll explains this on pages 46 &amp; 47 of his book On the Old Testament (A Book You’ll Actually Read):

I have also been asked many times whether we need to obey all commands in the Old  Tesatment. The short answer regarding law is that all of the Old Testament commands/laws were fulfilled in Jesus Christ (Matthew 5:17-18). This does not mean that we do not love and value the Old Testament law. But it does mean that we are no longer under it. Similarly, when I was in high school I had to sign an attendance sheet every day, go to assemblies, and bring a note if I had been sick. Since the graduation requirements have been met, I am no longer bound to do those things. This does not mean they were bad, only that they are completed. However, there are some laws from high school that are still binding on me. For example, at my school I was not allowed to kill anyone, sell drugs, or steal. These laws are still applicable to me, even though I have graduated.

Likewise, there are three kinds of laws in the Old Testament.

First, there are ceremonial laws, which are related to the priesthood, sacrifices, temple, and cleanness. These are now fulfilled in Jesus (for example, nearly the entire book of Hebrews addresses this issue for Jews who struggled with the Old Testament laws once they were saved). These laws are no longer binding on us because Jesus is our Priest, Sacrifice, Temple, and Cleanser.

Second, there are civil laws, which refer to the governing of Israel as a nation ruled by God. Since we are no longer a theocracy, these laws, while insightful, are not directly binding on us. As Romans 13 says, we must now obey our pagan government because God will work through it, too.

Third, there are moral laws, which prohibit such things as stealing, murdering, and lying. These laws are still binding on us even though Jesus fulfilled their requirements through His sinless life. Jesus Himself repeats and reinforces nine of the Ten Commandments. The only exception is the Sabbath, because that is part of the ceremonial law. Now our rest is in the finished work of Jesus, not just a day.

OP Edit: For me the actual answer to the above paragraph is stated in this:

&gt;Galatians 5:14 NLT New Living Translation

&gt;For the whole law can be summed up in this one command: ""Love your neighbor as yourself."" 

If you do this you do the law.

He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.
&gt;Colossians 1:15-20 NRSV

I find this passage to be one of the most beautiful passages written by early Christians. In it they declare their belief in Universal Salvation and how such a belief demonstrated a perfect symmetry between their belief of God being all things before/during creation and God being all things with the ultimate reconciliation of creation.

And if you have any doubt, if you read closely, the same ""all things"" that is reconciled in verse 20 is the same ""all things"" that were created in verse 16.  So if you believe that the writer didn't mean that literally all things were reconciled, then you must conclude that all things were not created by God.

While I no longer personally believe this passage to be true of objective reality for a number of reasons, I find it hard to understand how Christians who profess to believe the Bible literally in its original context cannot conclude from this passage that Universal Salvation is the clear teaching of this passage and, as such, at least one early Christian community.

The best evidence for Jesus' existence within the works of Josephus is that he makes a passing reference in one passage, and another passage is generally accepted to be added in later? Here are the passages in question:

&gt;And now Caesar, upon hearing the death of Festus, sent Albinus into Judea, as procurator. But the king deprived Joseph of the high priesthood, and bestowed the succession to that dignity on the son of Ananus, who was also himself called Ananus... Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of **Jesus, who was called Christ**, whose name was James, and some others; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned.

which is the one which is more authentic, and

&gt;Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.

which is admitted by most scholars to be embellished or fabricated by church leaders. He basically recounted the execution of one guy, and said ""if you're interested, he pretty much hung out with this one dude, maybe you heard of him?"" and that was it. That's the only authentic reference to Christ in Josephus' *entire* works on the history of the region. The *Testimonium* reference isn't mentioned by anyone until the 300s, by an anonymous author. Origen, a Christian theologian from the 2nd century, was very familiar with the works of Josephus, but *never*, in all of his authentic works, references the *Testimonius* passage. There is no evidence that Jesus was mentioned at all prior to the first passage I mentioned - the one that is generally regarded as authentic.

That's terrible evidence. That's hardly anything!

Furthermore...

We don't have Josephus' original writings. There aren't any mentions of the first, more authentic passage, until Eusebius tells us it is there in the 3rd century. We don't have any of Josephus' manuscripts until the 11th century, so there's a *huge* gap in our knowledge of that document (hereafter, *Antiquities* in particular).

Because of the grammar in Greek, there are three possibilities: that Josephus made *no* mention of Jesus, that the *Flavium* passage had some truth in it and mentioned Jesus Christ and Josephus was referencing that passage, or that the church leaders (Eusebius, to be exact) added the *Antiquities* reference to correlate better with the *Flavium* passage that was embellished upon, but had some authenticity.

If the *Flavium* passage is an outright forgery, then the *Antiquities* reference is dubious at best. Even as a partial forgery, why would Josephus qualify James in such a way? The readers should have already known which James he was talking about! Finally, the Greek manuscripts do not attach significant meaning to ""Christ"" as a title, even though most of the English translations do. The Greeks at the time had a grammatical quirk where they would reiterate an article for no reason other than cadence. The truest English translation would simply say ""...Jesus, called Christ"".

Galileo argued that such passages should not be taken literally. The Church obviously disagreed. Until 1992.

In 1992, it was reported in the news that the Catholic Church had turned around towards vindicating Galileo:

""Thanks to his intuition as a brilliant physicist and by relying on different arguments, Galileo, who practically invented the experimental method, understood why only the sun could function as the centre of the world, as it was then known, that is to say, as a planetary system. The error of the theologians of the time, when they maintained the centrality of the Earth, was to think that our understanding of the physical world's structure was, in some way, ***imposed by the literal sense of Sacred Scripture***...."" —Pope John Paul II, L'Osservatore Romano N. 44 (1264) - November 4, 1992

In 2000, Pope John Paul II issued a formal apology for all the mistakes committed by some Catholics in the last 2,000 years of the Catholic Church's history, including the trial of Galileo among others.

1. What Christians call God is really just an inner voice that everyone has.
2. The Church tries to replace our inner voices with their own beliefs.
3. Therefore, the church is keeping us from the ""true God"".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm talking about the generic notion of ""God"" as a force, entity or presence that seems to exist in opposition to (some of) our own wishes and desires.

Christians:

What if ""God"" was there all along before you converted or went to church or read the Bible? What if ""God"" was simply the voice of opposition within you that said ""yes"" when another part of you said ""no""? The voice that said ""no"" when another part of you said ""yes""? From early childhood, we all hear this opposing voice within ourselves. Even atheists hear this voice.

But Christianity teaches that we are all ignorant pagans without the *external* influence of the Bible and the Church. As such, Christians teach their children that the little voice inside of them is meaningless compared to the voice of the Church and the scriptures as interpreted by the Church.

I'm sure Christians will argue that the inner voice and Jesus are one and the same. But it's not that simple. Christianity demands belief in a whole package of ideas in addition to the belief in ""God"" as the inner voice of opposition to our own egotistical desires.

In addition to the aforementioned demand that Christians follow the scriptures as interpreted by the Church, Christianity also demands that we believe a man who lived 1,900 years ago was the one and only physical embodiment of the inner voice on earth. And Christianity demands that we believe this man-god was killed to atone for our sins and rose from the dead three days after being killed.

I don't need to believe these things to know that the inner voice is real. I don't deny reality. I honor reality. I worship reality.

And I believe that we are all Jesus. The voice of ""God"" is the birthright of each one of us. As such we are all sons and daughters of ""God"" nurtured by the inner voice. And we are all crucified, suspended between spirit and flesh (heaven and earth) nailed to the cross of materialism and forever advised by the opposing voices of the two thieves. What dies on the cross is the ego. Ego death results in a rebirth, a resurrection, of the true Self. Simply put: Jesus is a symbol, an archetype.

When I point out that Jesus himself said, ""the kingdom is within"", Christians quickly point to other translations rendering the word ""within"" as ""within our midst"". They don't want ""God"" to be our birthright. They want ""God"" to be available by membership only.

It is this impulse that causes Christians to train their children to disbelieve and devalue their own internal experience of ""God"" in favor of an external perception of a book and a religion as *the* representation of God on Earth, a representation through which any *valid* experience of God must be obtained. Outside of the Christian paradigm, children are trained to believe the inner voice is the devil. AFAIAC, Christian children are trained to believe God is the devil.

An object or thing which represents God is an idol. Christians demand that Christians be idol worshipers. But I maintain that ""God"" is not uniquely represented by a book or a religion or a man who lived 1,900 years ago or by an event that may or may not have occurred 1,900 years ago.

""God"" is not here in a unique collection of things and events. ""God"" is here in everything, every molecule of creation. ""God"" does not have to be proven by miracles, such as the literal reanimation of a three day old corpse. To me, the Christian insistence upon the occurrence of this supernatural event is a sign of doubt in the existence of the true God, not faith. Knowing the true God requires no faith.

Until we can get past religion, it will remain a fact that theistic claims to exclusive possession of *The Truth* are the greatest barrier to experiencing ""God"".",,False,,t5_2ryd5,True,,violet brackets,True,t3_q9sey,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/q9sey/theistic_claims_to_exclusive_possession_of_the/,

* Jesus was not sent to earth like Kal-El in some pod or something to land here, grow up, and become a superhero.  
* God did not get married, have a kid, raise him up with love teaching him how to play baseball and tie a tie, then send him to earth to die.  

Why then does the language seem to perpetuate the feelings associated with these ideas? Is it to help people relate to God so they can think, ""Hey, God must really love us if he was willing to send his son here to die for us""?

""Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will Yahveh bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed"" (Deut. 28:15-61).

Why isn't all of that metaphorical? We are spiritual people. We can be separated from God in this life. But no one claims that the tortures promised by the Christian god in the OT are metaphors.

It's pretty obvious to me that the temporal torments the Christian god threatened us with in the OT are the basis of the eternal torments the Christian god threatened us with in the NT. 

In the OT, the Christian god promises punishments and rewards in this life. In the NT, the Christian god promises punishments and rewards in the next life. This is probably what happens when you go from running your own country to having your country run for you ...by heathens. You can't get no satisfaction in this life so you transfer it all to the next life, in your fantasies.

And once the torments occur in your fantasies, in imaginary worlds, the sky's the limit. You can devise the most sadistic torments possible for your enemies, those *other* people. That is exactly what Jesus did when he invented the eternal burning torment of hell. And, like Moses, he meant for his threats of torture to be taken literally. 

Revelation 14

10 they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. 11 And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.”

This is not including angels, ""living creatures"" and the rest of the panoply of supernatural characters found in the Bible. Nowhere in the Bible does it express the idea of the Trinity as found in Christian doctrine. That is to say, it does not describe them as being simultaneously one and three distinct entities. [That doctrine wasn't orthodox until the 4th century CE.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity)


This doctrine is one which Islam points out as a major error of Christianity. It is one of the deadly sins of Islam: [شرك‎, or širk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirk_%28Islam%29) the placing of partners with God, or counting anything or anyone to be equals with God. 


I am not a Muslim, but I am mentioning Islam here to show how foreign this idea is even to another member of a major monotheism. Being raised as a fundamentalist Christian, I remember being taught this idea from early childhood and never examining it until I started to seriously think critically about whether I believed in the infallibility of the Bible. At that point, I discovered that it wasn't even in the Bible. 


Now, as an atheist, it just seems wacky to me when someone says ""these 3 separate things are all 1 thing."" Three distinct things are not one single thing. This is not logically possible. And you can't even base this assertion in scripture, so it's tough to say that it's an idea from God, and beyond human logic. This was a human idea. 


Here's an example. As a Christian, I'm sure you consider Hinduism to be a pantheistic religion. Would it make any difference to you to hear a Hindu say ""No, you don't understand. Aditya, Agni, Antariksha, Ashwini, Brihaspat, Dishas,  Dyaus, Indra, Ganesha, Marutas, Moordha, Prajapati, Savitr, Shiva Soma, Varuna, Vayu, Vishnu and Vishvedavas are all manifestations of a single godhead entity: Brahma, the Creator. You're just not interpreting the Vedas correctly.""  Well this is what a lot of Hindus say. To me, the Christian claim sounds very similar; the only difference being the number of gods that are claimed to still be one god.


You can take as many gods as you want, claim they are the same thing, and call your religion a monotheism, but that doesn't make it so. And it's really tough to expect someone on the outside to see it the same way, especially if they haven't been indoctrinated to ignore the logical contradictions from early childhood. 


So, Christians: **How can you reasonably tell me that you have a monotheistic religion without committing a logical contradiction?**

I do not understand this Moral Law, care to enlighten?

From my perspective:

The argument goes something like: all humans know right from wrong, therefore objective morals exist, therefore there is a source of objective morals, therefore God. But this does not make sense to me.

First off, all humans know right from wrong, but those rights and wrongs are not common. One person says it's wrong to have premarital sex, another says it's right. How does any sort of objective Moral Law apply here? Perhaps biblical law can lay a claim on this, but biblical law fails on slavery; fails to even acknowledge stem cell research; or euthanasia (given we can prolong suffering and life simultaneously).

I can only conclude that if there is a Moral Law then we do not understand it (e.g. slavery, what's gonna happen in another 2k years), and therefore it is rather useless.

1. God creates Adam and Eve.

2. Adam and Eve sin. 

3. The debt of sin is death so God punishes Adam, Eve, and all of mankind (Note: This debt/punishment is transferred to all of humanity with no exceptions or limitations).

4. The only way God would remove the debt of mankind is if we shed the blood of His son Jesus as a sacrifice to Himself.  So thousands of years after the fall, God becomes a man and dies on our behalf to pay our debt to Him.

5. Jesus’ blood covers us and God can now forgive mankind for the sin of Adam and Eve and give us eternal life, **but** this forgiveness is only limited to those who believe that Jesus is our savior and that he died to cover our sins; otherwise we are still saddled with the debt of sin.

Basically Adam &amp; Eve eating the fruit damned humanity across the board regardless of our beliefs; Jesus dying on the cross should save everybody across the board regardless of our beliefs, but it doesn't.

http://sausageoffaith.blogspot.com/2013/08/limbo.html?m=1

Since the time of Augustine it was believed that all humans were born with original sin and if left unbaptized that sin would persist.

This was a particuarly big issue for new born babies.  In the pre modern era infant mortality was much higher and having a child die before it was baptised meant that it could not enter heaven.  The church taught that these unbaptised babies went to limbo instead....until 2007  

In 2007 an advisory body know as the International Theological Comission released a document written by Pope John Paul II that concluded that in fact unbaptised babies who not necessarily have to go to limbo.

-----------

Here is the wiki entry:

*On April 22, 2007, the advisory body known as the International Theological Commission released a document, originally commissioned by Pope John Paul II, entitled ""The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die without Being Baptized.""[8] After tracing the history of the various opinions that have been and are held on the eternal fate of unbaptized infants, including that connected with the theory of the Limbo of Infants, and after examining the theological arguments, the document stated its conclusion as follows:
Our conclusion is that the many factors that we have considered above give serious theological and liturgical grounds for hope that unbaptized infants who die will be saved and enjoy the beatific vision. We emphasize that these are reasons for prayerful hope, rather than grounds for sure knowledge. There is much that simply has not been revealed to us.[28] We live by faith and hope in the God of mercy and love who has been revealed to us in Christ, and the Spirit moves us to pray in constant thankfulness and joy.[29]
What has been revealed to us is that the ordinary way of salvation is by the sacrament of baptism. None of the above considerations should be taken as qualifying the necessity of baptism or justifying delay in administering the sacrament. Rather, as we want to reaffirm in conclusion, they provide strong grounds for hope that God will save infants when we have not been able to do for them what we would have wished to do, namely, to baptize them into the faith and life of the Church.
Pope Benedict XVI authorized publication of this document, indicating that he considers it consonant with the Church's teaching, though it is not an official expression of that teaching.[30] Media reports that by the document ""the Pope closed Limbo""[31] are thus without foundation. In fact, the document explicitly states that ""the theory of limbo, understood as a state which includes the souls of infants who die subject to original sin and without baptism, and who, therefore, neither merit the beatific vision, nor yet are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal sin. This theory, elaborated by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, never entered into the dogmatic definitions of the Magisterium. Still, that same Magisterium did at times mention the theory in its ordinary teaching up until the Second Vatican Council. It remains therefore a possible theological hypothesis"" (second preliminary paragraph); and in paragraph 41 it repeats that the theory of Limbo ""remains a possible theological opinion"". The document thus allows the hypothesis of a limbo of infants to be held as one of the existing theories about the fate of children who die without being baptised, a question on which there is ""no explicit answer"" from Scripture or tradition.[30] It ought also to be mentioned here that the traditional theological alternative to Limbo was not Heaven, but rather some degree of suffering in Hell. At any rate, these theories are not the official teaching of the Catholic Church, but are only opinions that the Church does not condemn, permitting them to be held by its members, just as is the theory of possible salvation for infants dying without baptism.*

----------

So the church took a step backwards here.  It went from being certain about something to not really being sure.  In the meanwhile, all of the Catholic clergy told people that their children were not in heaven, which is a horrible thing for them to suffer through.

But I find this very unsatisfactory.  If Hell is any variation of eternal damnation, then no one would rationally choose it, because living things with a life span of &lt;100 years can't understand eternity.  And if god could prevent eternal suffering but chose not to, the magnitude of that ""sin"" would dwarf any evil that could be accomplished in a human lifetime.    That is to say, if God created humans knowing that a non-zero number of souls would be hell-bound, god should not have created life in the first place.  There is no choice involved, if no one living has a concept of hell.  

Or: imagine you're a parent of a five-year-old kid.  You want the best for him so you set some rules: i.e, look both before crossing the street.  You're very clear about this rule because the consequences of not following it is your kid being splattered across the road.  The kid is normal, he has his cuts and bruises and understands that he'll get hurt by if he's hit by a car but he's five years old.  He's a good kid and usually listens to you.

But one day he's playing catch next to a freeway with his friend and the ball goes flying and lands on the road.  Your kid goes running after it.  You see this and shout: Hey I told you to watch for cars, you better not run into the street or you're get hurt!  The kid hears you, but to him the ball is so close he thinks everything will be fine.  In this situation, if you, as the parent, could stop your kid, you would do so.  No rational person can say, well, I told him not to, it was his choice, and I'm not going to interfere with free will.  If someone said that and the kid died, he would be put on trial.

http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+11&amp;version=NIV.

Essentially Japhtheh makes a deal with god and it backfired, resulting in the need to sacrafice his daughter.

Unlike the story of Abraham and Issac, god actually let's Japhtheh go through with killing his child to fulfill the vow.

Bible Commentary from BibleGateway.com below will confirm this:

(4.) That what we have solemnly vowed to God we must conscientiously perform, if it be possible and lawful, though it be ever so difficult and grievous to us. Jephthah’s sense of the powerful obligation of his vow must always be ours (Jdg. 11:35): “I have opened my mouth unto the Lord in a solemn vow, and I cannot go back,” that is, “I cannot recall the vow myself, it is too late, nor can any power on earth dispense with it, or give me up my bond.” The thing was my own, and in my own power (Acts 5:4), but now it is not. Vow and pay, Ps. 76:11. We deceive ourselves if we think to mock God. If we apply this to the consent we have solemnly given, in our sacramental vows, to the covenant of grace made with poor sinners in Christ, what a powerful argument will it be against the sins we have by those vows bound ourselves out from, what a strong inducement to the duties we have hereby bound ourselves up to, and what a ready answer to every temptation! “I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot go back; I must therefore go forward. I have sworn, and I must, I will, perform it. Let me not dare to play fast and loose with god.
The Wikipedia page is full of experts who disagree with the story and proclaim that it is in error.

Once again, this boils down to the bible having a message and it needing to be interpreted a certain way in order to be defensible.

Would any Christian by willing to say that Japhtheh's daughter deserved what happened to her?

- 1) In 2 Kings 3:27, Yahweh is defeated by another god, Chemosh.
- 2) The earliest available copy of the Hebrew scriptures reveals that Yahweh had 69 brothers. Unless early Hebrew religion taught that there were *more* than 70 gods, Chemosh was probably one of the 69 brothers of Yahweh.
- 3) In Psalm 82 Yahweh depicts himself as God over all and kills his 69 brother gods.
- 4) BTW, the Chemosh episode also reveals Elisha to be a false prophet.

**TL;DR**

- 1) In 2 Kings 3:27 Yahweh not only admits the existence of the Moabite god, Chemosh. Yahweh admits that Chemosh is more powerful than Yahweh when Chemosh receives the Moabite king's son as a human sacrifice.

2 Kings 3:27
27 Then he (Mesha, king of the Moabites who worshiped Chemosh) took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The fury against Israel was great; they withdrew and returned to their own land.

Maybe that's why Yahweh decided to sacrifice his firstborn son? So he could be more powerful?

Do you think it is inconceivable that a follower of Yahweh could acknowledge the existence of another god?

The biblical hero, Jephthah, gave Chemosh equal billing with Yahweh.

23 “Now since the Lord, the God of Israel, has driven the Amorites out before his people Israel, what right have you to take it over? 24Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you? Likewise, whatever the Lord our God has given us, we will possess. (Judges 11)

- 2) The Hebrew text underlying the Septuagint reading of Deuteronomy 32:8-9 (below) from the most ancient available manuscript evidence (The Dead Sea Scrolls) reveals that Yahweh did indeed have 69 brothers.

""When the Most High (Elyon) assigned the nations their heritage, when he parceled out the descendants of Adam, He set up the boundaries of the peoples after the number of the sons of God;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the LORD’S own portion was Jacob, His hereditary share was Israel.""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Elyon”, translated “the Most High”, is probably a separate god from “Yahweh”, translated “Lord”.

The polytheistic nature of this passage became clear with the discovery in 1929 of Ugarit (related to Hebrew) texts in modern-day Syria at Ras Shamra.  The texts confirmed some of the names of Israel’s deities including Elyon.

In fact, **Yahweh appears to be only one of Elyon’s 70 sons**.  Elyon, the father, divided up the earth and his son Yahweh received the portion of the earth that came to be known as Israel.

http://triangulations.wordpress.com/2010/05/09/deuteronomy-328-9/

Literary and conceptual parallels discovered in the literature of Ugarit, however, have provided a more coherent explanation for the number seventy in Deuteronomy 32:8 and have furnished support for textual scholars who argue against the ""sons of Israel"" reading. Ugaritic mythology plainly states that the head of its pantheon, El (who, like the God of the Bible, is also referred to as El Elyon, the ""Most High"") fathered seventy sons, thereby specifying the number of the ""sons of El"" (Ugaritic, bn il). An unmistakable linguistic parallel with the Hebrew text underlying the Septuagint reading was thus discovered, one that prompted many scholars to accept the Septuagintal reading on logical and philological grounds--God (El Elyon in Deut. 32:8) divided the earth according to the number of heavenly beings who existed from before the time of creation. (Job 38:7 states that the heavenly host was present at creation.)

[DEUTERONOMY 32:8 AND THE SONS OF GOD](http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/Ted_Hildebrandt/OTeSources/05-Deuteronomy/Text/Articles/Heiser-Deut32-BS.htm)

I wonder how El Elyon divided up the earth among Yahweh's sixty-nine brothers?

We know that Yahweh's brother, Chemosh, got the region of the Moabites.

- 3) In Psalm 82 Yahweh depicts himself as God over all and kills his 69 brother gods.

God presides in the great assembly;
    he renders judgment among the “gods”:

2 “How long will you defend the unjust
    and show partiality to the wicked?
3 Defend the weak and the fatherless;
    uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.
4 Rescue the weak and the needy;
    deliver them from the hand of the wicked.

5 “The ‘gods’ know nothing, they understand nothing.
    They walk about in darkness;
    all the foundations of the earth are shaken.

6 “I said, ‘You are “gods”;
    you are all sons of the Most High.’
7 But you will die like mere mortals;
    you will fall like every other ruler.”

8 Rise up, O God, judge the earth,
    for all the nations are your inheritance.
(Psalm 82)

""The final editors of the Hebrew canon were fervent monotheists, but a remnant of the polytheistic basis of the pre-Mosaic religion can still be detected. Albrecht Alt has shown that divine titles such as 'El Bet' el (Gen. 31:13; 35:7); 'El 'Olam (Gen. 21:33); and 'El Ro'i (Gen. 16:13); 'El 'Elyon (Gen. 14:18); and 'El Saddai (Gen. 17:1); all later taken to be one God (Yahweh) after Moses, were all originally separate gods worshipped by the early Hebrews.3 The Catholic scholar Bruce Vawter concurs with Alt. According to Vawter, none of the available English translations does justice to the original Hebrew of Genesis 31:13, which quite simply reads ""I am the god Bethel"" ('El Bet'el), who was a member of the Canaanite pantheon along with the rest of the above.4 The original meaning is therefore quite different from the traditional understanding: this god at Bethel is not the universal Lord who appeared at Bethel but just one god among many – a local deity of a specific place.""

http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/ngier/henotheism.htm

Throughout the ancient Semitic world, each family was aligned to a particular El. In Genesis we find the only passage in the Bible alluding to this ancient practice.

The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us."" So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac, (Genesis 31:53, RSV)

Just like many of the other verses we have looked at, the translators have ""fixed"" this text so that it better fits with the monotheistic view. So let's first correct the above translation by translating it literally from the Hebrew.

The Elohim of Abraham and the Elohim of Nahhor, they will judge between us, the Elohim of their father, and Jacob swore with the fear of his father Isaac.

Note that the Hebrew states, ""they will judge,"" not ""he will judge,"" therefore we are looking at two different Elohim, one belonging to Abraham (the ancestor of Jacob) and the other to Nahhor (the ancestor of Laban). Because we are looking at two different Elohim, the Elohim in the phrase ""the Elohim of their father"" must be used in the plural sense.

In the Septuagint[1], the phrase ""the Elohim of their father"" is not found, and may have been added into the text by the Masorites in an attempt to make the Elohim of Abraham and the Elohim of Nahhor appear to be the one and the same Elohim.

Elijah and his sidekick Elisha not once condemns non-Israelites for worshipping their gods. Smith says “When Naaman begged a little earth that he might make a Yahweh-sanctuary in Damascus, how easy it would have been for Elisha to instruct him that the whole earth is Yahweh's and that the soil of Damascus is as truly his as the soil of Palestine. But the opportunity passed without improvement. Neither Elijah nor his biographer thought that the woman of Zarephath ought to give up the service of her Baal on the ground that there was no God but Yahweh. These facts are inexplicable except on the theory that neither Elisha nor Elijah nor the men who wrote their lives denied the existence of the heathen gods. Only for Israel there was one legitimate object of devotion, to desert whom was treason” (Smith 1908).

http://toby.weebly.com/hebrew-henotheism.html

- 4) BTW, the Chemosh episode also reveals Elisha to be a false prophet.

2 Kings 3 

14 Elisha said, “As surely as the Lord Almighty lives, whom I serve, if I did not have respect for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not pay any attention to you. 15 But now bring me a harpist.”

While the harpist was playing, **the hand of the Lord came on Elisha 16 and he said, “This is what the Lord says**: I will fill this valley with pools of water. 17 For this is what the Lord says: You will see neither wind nor rain, yet this valley will be filled with water, and you, your cattle and your other animals will drink. 18 This is an easy thing in the eyes of **the Lord; he will also deliver Moab into your hands.** 19 You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town. You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs, and ruin every good field with stones.”

As a result of the war, the Moabites retained their independence from Israel.

If Moab was a football and Yahweh delivered Moab into Israel's hands, then Israel dropped the ball before he made it into the end zone.

Elisha is a false prophet.

According to the Christian god's law, Elisha should have been executed for making a false prophecy.

19 I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name. 20 But **a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded**, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, **is to be put to death**.”

21 You may say to yourselves, “How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the Lord?” 22 **If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not take place or come true, that is a message the Lord has not spoken.** That prophet has spoken presumptuously, so do not be alarmed. (Deuteronomy 18)

So Elisha was a false prophet. And since Yahweh failed to act on his highly developed sense of so-called “justice” (by having Elisha put to death as a false prophet), we can also conclude that Yahweh was/is a false god.

Or maybe sometimes the True God simply fails to act on his highly developed sense of so-called “justice”.",,False,,t5_2ryd5,1374798832.0,,violet brackets,True,t3_1iqx44,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/1iqx44/chemosh_1_yahweh_0/,

Christians, on the other hand, claim to be very different than the Pharisees/Rabbis/Judaism, claiming truth and such. However if you read the Bible it's very obvious that Paul of Tarsus is acting Messiah, and that Jesus of Nazareth is a puppet Messiah. Messiah is described, even by Jesus, as the illuminator of the law and the prophets, the revealer of truth and the meaning of Torah. Yet when you ask a Christian what Torah means or truth or life, they quote Paul, and equivocate his words to God's words. Meanwhile Paul was (1) not prophesied about, on the contrary only warnings of false teachers after Jesus are given, (2) he appoints himself and says god did it, (3) he follows the exact pattern of what Torah and Jesus described as a false prophet, (4) he claims to see Jesus, which Jesus said is an automatic sign of a false prophet, (5) he ethnically cleanses and hellenizes Torah and creates new doctrines and rules, nullifying others by his own authority, (6) he is adversarial to Jesus' disciples, (7) he claims to still be a Pharisee during his ministry (Jesus warns about this too).

What's your definition of true Christianity? I would say that it is identified by a 100% devotion to and following of the Bible. **Is that a reasonable definition: that the best Christians are those that follow their scriptures most closely?**

**If so,** I'd say that the fundies are the closest you could possibly get to a ""true"" Christian. They take the Bible as the literal words of God, and refuse to accept any other source of evidence as equally good. This is exactly why they hate homosexuals, why they believe the earth is 6000 years old, and why they don't let their kids read Harry Potter because it's ""witchcraft."" Fundies are ridiculous because the Bible is ridiculous.

**On the other hand,** if a truly religious person is someone who does **not** religiously follow their scriptures, then *why not?* What else do you have with which to measure true religiosity? Deep down, you know that what fundies do is ridiculous, regardless of what the Bible says. So, you water down the Bible, taking just the nice happy parts and calling that true Christianity.

God existed before all things. If God did not exist before all things, something came before God and thus, God is not omnipotent.

2. God knows all things. If there is even one thing God does not know, God is not omniscient.

With those two things in mind, I will explain my thought process.

At one point, God is the only thing existing, just God and nothing else. God decides he wants to create something. God develops a plan, reviews his plan, then goes through with creating it. God has an idea to create the universe. Because he knows all things, he knows every single event that will take place within the universe BEFORE he even creates it. God develops a plan for the universe, reviews his plan for the universe, then creates the universe.

 Scale this down to the creation of human kind. God develops a plan for human kind, part of this plan is a test to see if humans will choose God over sin. Since God knows all things, he must know the outcome of the test prior to creating it. God KNOWS that if he creates a test of God vs. sin for humans, the humans will choose sin.

TL:DR - My question boils down to this. If God knew the results of the test he designed for human kind (God vs. Sin) BEFORE he even went through with creating it, did humans choose to defy God or did God make it destiny? 

If the answer is ""humans chose to defy God"", Why wouldn't he alter the outcome while reviewing his plan before creation?
