On the canvas, it looked good. I liked it. When I uploaded it onto the computer I had to cut off the uneven outline (I had taken a picture of it at a slight angle, so it didn't come out with right angles). After I cropped it, I saw that I liked it better than the uncropped original. 

Initially I felt crappy. Why couldn't I make it look like that in the first place? I didn't make it as good as it could've been. Argh.

Then it occurred to me - the painting simply wasn't finished yet. It took a new perspective to figure it out, but now I know how to make it better. I'm going to use a straight edge to crop the painting into the way I like it.

1369793716.0,18,self.painting,1f8qo5,My dad is dying and I want him to pick up a long-lost hobby/passion.,sh00ks,20,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/painting/comments/1f8qo5/my_dad_is_dying_and_i_want_him_to_pick_up_a/,"My dad was diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer in 2002. By then, it had already spread to his cranium, ribs, pelvis, and leg bones. The doctor gave him 2 years. He didn't tell our family; he kept it a secret so we could live, if only for a few more months, in blissful ignorance. That protective bubble lasted 8 years up until the moment I found a medication bottle with a very long and complicated label. As a result of natural curiosity, Google delivered me the news.

Despite knowing he didn't have much longer to live, that motherfucker worked everyday to help my brother and I pay our way through University. He encouraged us to follow our passion and to never work a job we didn't love. We listened: my brother took Fine Arts and I, Film Studies.

Even when his muscles began to deteriorate and the pain was so unbearable he would be lucky to get a couple hours of sleep, he worked. Not until this March, when his legs literally could no longer hold his weight did he have to resign from the architecture firm. Worked on a Tuesday - collapsed - unable to work on Wednesday. It killed him inside. A man who has worked for 40 years suddenly forced, against his will, to stop. He cried that night. I've only ever seen him cry at his father's funeral when I was 10. Powerful, to say the least: your hero, the man you look up to in every possible way, is helpless.

Since then, he had been quite literally on his death bed. The palliative care nurse visited him and told us to make funeral arrangements. We did. We cancelled his cellphone and my sister's wedding booking, which was suppose to be his birthday surprise. I imagine getting that deposit back hurt her in ways I will never understand.

I say ""had been"" on his death bed because he was, and is no longer. After 3 days of diving in and out of consciousness, he arose telling us of a dream he was having, that he was ""operating on himself"". Now, I'm not sure what that means, but they're his words, not mine. A week passes and things are looking up - how could they not when you've internally accepted the death of a loved one and here they are talking to you over tea?

Though, he is not the man he used to be. Worse, he knows it; overwhelmed by his current condition and his inability to do basic tasks, depression set in. 

My dad is a great man and a wonderful artist. He always loved to paint, but was never able to in his spare time. He sacrificed hobbies, employment opportunities, and just about everything under the sun for the chance to be by his child's side for a few extra minutes. 

I believe if he starts painting again, it will be therapeutic for him. This father's day I want to give him the ability to do that. Unfortunately, I know nothing about painting and you guys do! Could anyone help me find some easels that would be easy to hold and rest on your lap? Due to his pain in the pelvic region, he's usually in a half sitting/half lying down position. Ideas for paints and alike would be awesome to!



I really appreciate the help /r/painting, it means a lot. 

TL;DR - My dad is dying from cancer and is depressed that he can no longer do the things he once did. I want to give him the ability to pick up his love of painting again. I'm just asking for some help on where I can buy easels and painting paraphernalia that would be easy for him to use.

But it looked like a topographical map with various colors.

The painting itself was smooth (from being sanded) and the lines of the paint were clean like that picture.  

I asked the artist years ago and he told me, but I forgot.  Well, I reached out to him again and he explained in an email:

&gt; I'm not sure if there is a technical term for it.  I basically imitate natural processes by layering different colors of paint (letting each dry before I do then next) then wearing away with a machine sander.  Splattering an uneven layer as the first layer makes it bumpy so different colors come through much like a topographical map or eroded stones.

I was wondering if anybody has done something similar to this and if you care to explain in a little more detail (or have any videos demonstrating it).  I'd like to replicate this background and paint on top of it.

I'm much more into abstract stuff and color experiments, and will probably have space for a smallish easel. 

Should I try acrylics or oil first? What kind of brushes should I get? What brands would you recommend in the vein of ""cheaper but not super shitty""? What sort of paper (canvas?) should I get? Can I mix paints? 

I'm coming in blind, so any tips or answers would be greatly appreciated!

For example, one might post a challenge such as: ""A rosebush. The beach. A child's stuffed toy. Take those three things and come up with a painting."" Then, in the comments, everyone can respond with whatever they've come up with.

The subreddit is open to other forms of creativity too (music, writing, etc), but I wanted to give everyone a shot at showcasing their creativity!

My dad was a fantastic oil painter, and I had always meant to ask him to teach me, however, he passed away before I really got an interest. 

My brother gave me some oil paint and a few canvases/ canvas boards, and now (after a lengthy cry), I have no idea where to start. I stumbled across this sub and thought you guys could point me in the right direction of a good tutorial, or even give me a couple tips yourselves- like major differences between the two, things I really should not do with oil that you do with acrylic, etc. Any 'I learned this the hard way' stories are welcome!

Long story short is that I live in China and for years have seen   [this statue](http://imgur.com/a/71WQp) outside of a restaurant. Recently the place closed and the local hoods took it upon themselves to desecrate this dude. 

I have time and interest and would like to repaint him so that he looks as awesome as he should and I have the following questions which I hope you can help answer.

1) Should I do anything before I begin painting? I have already thoroughly washed and disinfected.

2) Should I use a primer? Would white spray-paint be a good idea? What would be a better idea?

3) Can I use acrylic paints and a fixative? What would be a better option?

Thank you very much in advance and I appreciate any advice.

I did a surrealist/bubblegum/squishy take on the politics from 08. I want to start a new series for the upcoming election but want some fresh ideas. I am not sure what the teacup represents. I just like painting them. I think the critters are obvious. Should I use the donkeys and elephants again? Skip the cups?
I like Romney's ""mittens"" nickname but want something equally as cute for Obama if I use it.


Any ideas are welcome- be as silly, kind, mean, sarcastic as you want.


My topic ideas thus far are:


Healthcare but I don't want to use typical hospital imagery

economics

civil rights

voter fraud/registration 

any interesting campaign bloopers


edit- sorry my links are all messed up.  I will try to fix them.

So I'm using a photo from [TackORama.net](http://tackorama.net/) [A fun retro stock photography site. A lot of the photos are of unknown origin and unknown copyright status] to paint from. I altered a bit it in Photoshop, but it's essentially the same. I am using THAT as reference to paint it by hand. Mostly for practice mixing colors, but I really like they way it's turning out.

I recreated the image myself onto the canvas, but I didn't take the original photo (because it's from the 50's). Is it ""my"" work? Can I hang it in a gallery with my name on it? Can I sell it? If not, how much does the image need to be altered before I can? Not that I would with this particular piece, but I'm rather enjoying painting retro photos. 

Just want to know if I can call it my own, or what I *should* be calling it!

EDIT: I just thought of another question. I have credits at a stock photography site. What if I *purchase* a photo that is ok for commercial use, and paint that?

Then I forget about all this and it becomes all colour and lines. I don't really want to market my art as it should be art and not marketing. All I know is that I want to paint them and make them beautiful.

However, I love seeing the talent within people. I want to inspire creativity and find the most talented people out there to build something special. 

I have thought of different mediums to find my talent, but would like to start with a painting challenge. To do this, I have a few questions to get in the heads of some of the internets most talented painters:

1. How much prize money would incentive you to paint something (min. 24 x 30) if royalties were included on any money your painting made?

For my giftee, I am custom painting a pair of headphones with Adventure Time characters (his favourite cartoon). I am using acrylics, obviously.

The painting is going well, and I am trying to get it as smooth as possible, but there is still some ""painterlyness"" to it. I want to smooth it out some, so it looks cleaner. But I don't want to strip the paint for obvious reasons either, haha.

Any suggestions? Would using a fine steel wool or REALLY REALLY low grit sandpaper (~200 grit) gently smooth the surface and reduce the visible brush strokes without completely stripping the paint? Or would I be better off just embracing the brushstrokes?

And I know that I'll need to buy some paints, an easel, brushes, palette, knife, thinner (what kind?). 

And then I figure, if I'm going to get really good at this, then I'm going to need to clock 10,000 hours in. Maybe I'll do about 5 [edit: hours] per week (currently working and going to school, full time each, so very busy!).
