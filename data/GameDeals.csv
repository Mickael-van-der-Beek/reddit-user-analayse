**~~Better deal available on Green Man Gaming with voucher GMG20-F202F-UI40F, price = $24~~ I have heard this deal has expired. However, you can still get B:I for around $25 on Amazon!

&gt;Step 1: Go to http://www.amazon.com/2K-Games-BioShock-Infinite-Download/dp/B009SPZ11Q/

&gt;Step 2: Apply coupon at checkout: gooncave

&gt;**Final Price: $25.49**

&gt;Step 3: Amazon will get you to download a very small EXE file, which then downloads two HTML pages. One page has your Steam key, the other has instructions on how to download Steam and activate the copy.

As usual if you have any suggestions for these threads please, feel free to tell me.

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale, for whatever reason.

**Notes**

Amazon requires that you have a US BILLING ADDRESS to purchase from them.

Reposts of Amazon games on sale will be removed during the sale.

If Amazon price matches a Steam game on sale - which they might - that is okay for posting on its own.

As the sale develops more information will be added each day and each day's posts will include an update of what goes on sale that day so if you check for these threads daily you will not miss anything.

Join others for chat about games on irc.snoonet - [details here](/1blyks)

As usual if you have any suggestions for these threads please, feel free to tell me.

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale, for whatever reason. Just let me know if you spot any and I will correct them.

First and foremost let me note that I reached out to the mods and got permission to post this thank you note. I'll give an update on a few upcoming deals and pricing at the end though to keep this semi-deal related.

I wanted to take the opportunity to thank /r/gamedeals for the massive amount of support these past months. Whether it be [Tastes_of_vanilla](http://www.reddit.com/user/tastes_of_vanilla) providing his daily updates for our deals, [Pharnaces_II](http://www.reddit.com/user/Pharnaces_II) tossing us mentions in the Steam daily threads, or [Megatruck](http://www.reddit.com/user/MEGATRUCK) [drawing pictures of me shooting savings from a plasma gun](http://i.imgur.com/SIR9k.jpg?1), all of the constant feedback has been amazing and we appreciate it.

I hope you've all enjoyed getting in on and discussing the deals we've been running as much as we've been enjoying putting them together and bringing them to you.

We've got some fun stuff planned for 2013, Happy New Year /r/GameDeals.

As usual if you have any suggestions for these threads please, feel free to tell me.

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale, for whatever reason. Just let me know if you spot any and I will correct them.

I think it's only for PC Digital downloads. Also, you can't use it on a game 30 days new, Star Wars: The Old Republic, or any Valve games. I already got Dragon Age 2 and The Saboteur for free!

Well shit, people...[we crashed Origin](http://i.imgur.com/Gqena.png)

**EDIT:** Code is no longer working. Hope you enjoyed it while it lasted. But it seems stupid for them to completely remove the code, when people might still want to use it the way it's supposed to be used for. If that's the case, they should send out more emails with unique codes tied to the account that the survey was completed on, as it says the code is valid until October 21st.

**Notes**

- All the links here carry the [AbleGamer's](http://www.ablegamers.com/) affiliate tag, so you'll be helping them with every purchase.

Amazon requires that you have a US BILLING ADDRESS to purchase from them.

Reposts of Amazon games on sale will be removed during the sale.

If Amazon price matches a Steam game on sale - which they might - that is okay for posting on its own.

As the sale develops more information will be added each day and each day's posts will include an update of what goes on sale that day so if you check for these threads daily you will not miss anything.

Join others for chat about games on irc.snoonet - [details here](/1blyks)

Reminder: Please do not offer to buy / sell / trade / giveaway / split purchases. There are other subs for that: /r/gamesell, /r/gameswap, /r/playitforward, /r/SteamGameSwap. Any comments that do will be removed.

**Notes**

 - Amazon requires that you have a **US BILLING ADDRESS** to purchase from them. 

 - Reposts of Amazon games on sale will be removed during the sale.

 - If Amazon price matches a Steam game on sale - which they might - that is okay for posting on its own.

 - As the sale develops more information will be added each day and each day's posts will include an update of what goes on sale that day so if you check for these threads daily you will not miss anything.

As usual if you have any suggestions for these threads please, feel free to tell me.

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale, for whatever reason.

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale, for whatever reason.

1367513277.0,493,self.GameDeals,1dk656,Region Restriction - VPN and Proxy Talk.,RedditCommentAccount,637,144,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/1dk656/region_restriction_vpn_and_proxy_talk/,"Hey,

Over the last month or so, we've been noticing an increase in deals from regional sites. The deals from these regional sites will sometimes be unavailable to users from outside that region. Exploiting regional restrictions to get a good deal is not a new occurrence on /r/GameDeals. From fake addresses to VPNs and proxies, there are ways of getting around the restrictions. You probably see a comment mentioning one of these in every regional thread. We feel that this issue has gotten big enough that we need to address it.

We have talked about ways that we could deal with this issue, but none of the solutions seem satisfactory. Ultimately, we've come to the conclusion that /r/GameDeals is an international subreddit and that disallowing regional deals is not an option. Short of an outright ban on regional deals, we realize that we can't stop people from exploiting regional restrictions. If people want to purchase regional deals, they should at least be doing it safely. We want people to be aware of the dangers associated with it. Instead of this discussion being relegated to the sometimes unreliable and misinformed comment section, we want to directly address it and hopefully provide accurate information and a place to ask questions. 

While we can offer some insight into what we've seen and other users can offer their experiences, your individual experiences may vary. A user's claim regarding regional restrictions, whether positive or negative, shouldn't be taken on any kind of authority. The only people that will be able to tell you about their policy on regional restrictions are the retailers and services. One of the more extreme policies is from the most used digital distribution service, Steam:

&gt;*You agree that you will not use IP proxying or other methods to disguise the place of your residence, whether to circumvent geographical restrictions on game content, to purchase at pricing not applicable to your geography, or for any other purpose. If you do this, we may terminate your access to your Account.*

Steam's policy, while extreme, is not wholly dissimilar to others in the industry. Many digital game distribution services or retailers state in their Terms of Service (TOS) that using a VPN/Proxy service will result in an account termination or your purchase being revoked. **We advise you to never use a VPN/Proxy Service to activate games.**

Issues regarding account termination for exploiting regional restrictions are not the most common issue that we hear about. By far, the most common issue is a retailer charging the user for a purchase, but the user never receiving the product or receiving the product and having it revoked at a later time. While a number of you would consider issuing a chargeback at that point, a chargeback is a serious action that can lead to account termination or additional fees if your card issuer finds in favor of the merchant. A chargeback is not a secret weapon against merchants and should not be used lightly.  

The most critical issue is one of information safety. The safety of your information(credit card, personal information, and username &amp; password) should be a concern when you choose to use a free VPN or Proxy service. These free services will sometimes serve hundreds or thousands of users. Providing a free service on that scale does cost money to operate. If you aren't paying for the service, you are the product. Put simply, what happens between you, a VPN/proxy, and an endpoint (such as Steam, PayPal, another region's website, etc.) *could be* logged and used for malicious reasons. 

Our top concern is the safety of the users of /r/GameDeals. We want you to be aware of the dangers associated with using VPNs and proxies.


Thanks,

-Adam(and the other /r/GameDeals mods)


**TL;DR**

* Don't use a VPN to activate games on your account!
* Consider the possible dangers when buying from another region.
* Don't put your credit card information, username and password, or any other personal information into a form that's passed through a middleman.",,False,self,t5_2qwx3,False,,,True,t3_1dk656,http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/1dk656/region_restriction_vpn_and_proxy_talk/,moderator

For those first three discounts, I listed every game. For the 75% off discount, however, there are were way too many games to list them all (almost 400!). To make the list more manageable, I listed only those with a Metascore of 75 or higher. But this left out some real gems, particularly those that don't have enough reviews to get an official Metascore. So here's a second sweep through the list (almost 70 more games). My new criteria:

* 75% off
* Permit games with fewer than 4 critic reviews (no official Metascore)
* User Score is 75 or higher **or** critic scores are 75 or higher (scores are marked bold when **both** are 70 or higher)
* Not already mentioned in previous Deepest Discount post

Just popping in to point out some new things.

There's this secondary subreddit that we've been using for about ten months now. It's for everything that doesn't fit into /r/GameDeals. It's called /r/GameDealsMeta, and we'd appreciate it if you subscribed there. /r/GameDealsMeta is a catch-all for things that are tangentially related to /r/GameDeals. This includes discussions about deals and companies, suggestions for /r/GameDeals, and, most importantly, information about past deals. Yes, this includes PSAs, like [Tony's recent post about Divinity II: Dragon Knight Saga being upgraded to Director's Cut](http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDealsMeta/comments/1bzyws/psa_if_you_bought_divinity_ii_dragon_knight_saga/), or numerous postings about past bundles that have added Steam codes. Seriously, check it out and subscribe, because that's where all the PSAs have been going.

You'll also notice some cool changes around the edges of /r/GameDeals. First, there's a brand new submission arrow in the sidebar for non-deal posts. That will submit the post directly to /r/GameDealsMeta. Second, we've changed our sticky (the text at the top of every page on /r/GameDeals). We've made it stand out more, because many people were mentioning that they hadn't seen it. That's crazy, considering it's on *every* GameDeals page. We've also updated it with a link to a [multi-reddit of GameDeals/new and GameDealsMeta/new.](http://se.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/search?q=subreddit%3AGameDeals+OR+subreddit%3AGameDealsMeta&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Yes, it's not the normal method for multi-reddits, but this one allows us to still show our fancy CSS.

So yeah, **subscribe to /r/GameDealsMeta today!**

Edit: Oh, right, upvote for visibility. No karma for self-posts.

Edit2 for clarification: If you browse GameDeals/new anyway (the best way to view GameDeals), and you want to see both GameDeals and GameDealsMeta at the same time, then just change your bookmark to the multilink at the top of the page.

I've never been a big fan of how Steam categorizes their games really broadly. This is especially difficult when as far as I know, there isn't a way to search for multiple genres or categories at once. Some games aren't even tagged with categories.

I decided to make a list of all the games Steam has on sale currently in the Winter Sale to help people find games more specific to a particular genre they might be interested in and help draw attention to some unknown/underrated games. The emphasis of the list was on indie games and lesser known or forgotten titles. 

Keep in mind, I have not played a majority of these games and categorization comes from a first look basis, mostly from the store page, some with additional videos online. Some will be wrong and suggestions, whether it be for an additional categories or to indicate a game should be moved to a more fitting category would really help.

Metacritic scores were omitted since 1. not all games have them. 2. many of them are done when a game is first released and usually considers bugs/glitches present in the game that may have been fixed later. 3. they are subjective to an extent.

The rest of the list will be posted in the comments. If the game is part of a collection in the same series, the collection is included with the price of the individual core games (not DLC) will be included beside the prices of the bundle in brackets. GOLD is usually an indicator of a collection.

The list will be continue to be updated so suggestions are again, welcome. Also feel free to ask if you have any other questions such as why a game fell under a certain category or what mechanics and gameplay was considered for a certain category.

EDIT: Forgot to mention that the prices listed are the lowest prices the game has been sold for (Daily/Flash deals).

A little over a year and a half ago we had just hit 10,000 subscribers. Today we reach 100,000 subscribers. It hasn't been a perfectly smooth experience. We've had our fair share of growing pains. From /r/GameDealsMeta stumbling out of the gate to the rise of rule-breaking sponsored links, we know that there are always things that we can work to improve. But these temporary hiccups only help punctuate the fantastic couple of years that we've had. /r/GameDeals has turned into a great resource for saving money, getting opinions on games and deals, interacting with the reps, and passively helping our charity partners with your purchases. We're proud of the community and we know that it couldn't be where it is today without you. Everybody contributes in their own way. Be it through comments, deal submissions, or even just voting. Thank you.

With an eye on the future, we'd like to open up the comments for feedback on our moderation or the direction of the subreddit and suggestions about features or changes that you'd like to see in the future.

Thank you,

-The mods.",,False,self,t5_2qwx3,1368647988.0,,,True,t3_1ee8dc,http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/1ee8dc/100000_a_retrospective_and_looking_forward/,moderator
1339805167.0,388,self.GameDeals,v49wg,Let's Get Ready For The Steam Summer Sale 2012!,bryanhbell,501,113,206,http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/v49wg/lets_get_ready_for_the_steam_summer_sale_2012/,"Steam's annual summer sales in 2011 and 2010 both started on the last Thursday in June, so my bet is that this year's sale will start ~~Thursday, June 28th~~.

**EDIT: I was wrong. The sale did not begin on this date. See [FAQs About Steam's Big Sales](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vnrr5) for further information.**

Reddit has been a great place to get information on these sales, thanks to redditors like [ltx](//www.reddit.com/user/ltx), [Remmib](//www.reddit.com/user/Remmib), [squidthesid](//www.reddit.com/user/squidthesid), [CommentStatistics](//www.reddit.com/user/CommentStatistics) and others. Subreddits like /r/gaming and /r/games have played host to these redditors' daily posts, while subreddits such as /r/steamdeals and /r/GameDeals have carried the torch between the big sales. Thanks to you all! You make these sales so much fun!

*Sadly, ltx will only be available to do his daily posts on the weekends. But we've got you covered. Remmib will be on hand to do his daily posts and I've offered to step in for ltx on weekdays. Plus, squidthesid has agreed to once again provide his excellent commentaries on the games (see below for an example of his work).*

**But here's where I need help from all of you.**

I'd like your input on the ways we could improve the daily sales posts. Below is a template for my daily sale posts. It is based on previous sale posts by ltx and Remmib (such as [this](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/nv4os/steam_holiday_sale_2011_day_11/) and [this](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/nv4ok/steam_holiday_sale_day_11_useful/)).

What should be added? Changed? Removed? I'm particularly interested in those pieces of information that are most helpful to redditors when deciding whether or not to buy a game.

Keep in mind that there is a 10,000 character limit on self-post text, so we'll need to be choosy and include only the most useful information. Also, assembling the information for these posts is time-consuming, so any resources (such as [this](//steamdrm.flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=DRM_Lists/The_Big_DRM_List) and [this](//www.steamprices.com/)) you can provide for finding information is most appreciated.

1350414372.0,363,self.GameDeals,11l1q5,"Reminder: GameDeals is a place for legitimate game sales available to large numbers of people. It is not for coupons, giveaways, CD Key sites, or discussion threads. (Please report those posts.)",ih8evilstuff,504,141,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/11l1q5/reminder_gamedeals_is_a_place_for_legitimate_game/,"With 14 posts and 5 comments removed in the past 48 hours, I'd say it's about time for another one of these threads. (Also, it's been exactly two months since [the last one](http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/yceza/reminder_gamedeals_is_a_place_for_game_sales/). This one's a bit longer, though.)

The GameDeals subreddit has been growing a lot lately. We have almost 50,000 subscribers. (Hooray!) However, we've also seen an increase in people not reading the rules. To stop this subreddit from eventually devolving into image macros and other memes (hyperbole, I know), we (the moderators) have been keeping things very strict with what is allowed here. To remind you, here are the rules. (These are not new rules, they have been here for a while.)

**The following are not allowed:**

* Blogspam that isn't about an offline sale. (There's really no reason to post a link to a blog when posting a link directly to the sale saves everyone's time.)

* Redirection links or URL shorteners. (There's no reason to use these on reddit ever.)

* Affiliate tags on links, with the exception of Amazon links using approved affiliate IDs. (Allowing affiliate programs causes a lot of low-quality posts from greedy spammers. However, Child's Play and the EFF are worthy causes, so we allow those. Their links will be green.)

* Unauthorized CD key resellers. (They might be cheap, but they're way too risky. See my note below.)

* Anything that isn't information about a sale (This includes giveaways, coupons, auctions, and other super-limited things. We have nearly 50,000 subscribers. If there's only one or two copies of the game, they'll be gone in seconds, and the post will still be there, cluttering up the page. My general rule is it must be available to at least 1-2% of subscribers. If you're giving away something, try /r/PlayItForward, /r/RandomActsOfGaming, or /r/GiftofGames. Also, threads dedicated to discussion aren't allowed. It's okay to talk in the comments. Hell, it's encouraged. However, creating new posts that say ""How is your Borderlands 2 adventure going?"" is not allowed. Try /r/games, /r/TrueGaming if you have something in-depth, or /r/PatientGamers if it's an older game.)

**Edit for clarification**: Coupon codes that are redeemable by a large number of people are fine, since those are basically sales. Steam coupons and similar aren't allowed. It's all about the number that can redeem one code. That Origin thing where EA screwed up and allowed anyone to redeem the $20-off code? That's fine. EA's fix of emailing unique one-use codes? Those aren't allowed. (Also, reminders to check your email also aren't allowed.)

About unauthorized resellers:

""Unauthorized resellers"" is the term the GameDeals mods have been using when we're talking about sites that don't get their copies of games from the game's publisher. They get codes from some other source, and since that source is never revealed, customers run the risk of buying a key that was stolen at some point. Publishers commonly figure out which keys were stolen, and hand those lists to distributors, asking them to remove those copies of the game. Valve has no easy way of removing a single game from a Steam account, and they have been known to lock/ban entire accounts because some not-so-legally-obtained keys were redeemed.

We don't want that to happen to unsuspecting people just because they wanted to save a few bucks. So we banned unauthorized resellers from GameDeals.

We can't actually tell which sites have stolen keys, but there are some clues that a site isn't fully legitimate. The first thing I look at is the base price at that store. Right now, Borderlands 2 has a base price of $59.99 at every major retailer. From that price, sales will bring the end price down a bit, but the base price will still be sixty bucks. If I open a site and see that their base price for a $60 game is $28, and a sale lowers it even further, I'm highly skeptical.

Another method I use: If you look in the game features section (where the site normally tells you if it's a Steam game, has multiplayer support, etc.), a lot of unauthorized resellers will boast that they will send you a *scanned code* via email. Dead giveaway. If you were a games publisher, and you wanted to give Steam codes for your game to a digital-only site so they could sell them, would you print up individual cards with scratch-off/peel-off codes, then ship them off just to have them be scanned in at their end? Fuck no, those cards cost money to make! You'd just send them an email (or some other digital document) with codes in it.

1364918672.0,309,self.GameDeals,1bisig,Promoted Links: What they mean for the subreddit and what we can do about them.,RedditCommentAccount,382,73,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/1bisig/promoted_links_what_they_mean_for_the_subreddit/,"Hey,

Over the past month, some of you may have noticed that there have been a few promoted links on the hot page of the subreddit. The first instance was a promoted link from a popular CD-key reseller aggregator. We didn't realize that /r/GameDeals was big enough to be considered for advertising and it took us by surprise. We quickly got into contact with the admins and they did an amazing job. They were able to address our concerns and disable that promoted link with the same sense of urgency that we felt. *CD-key resellers are against the rules of /r/GameDeals because they pose a potential risk to the users of this subreddit. With the lower price of CD-key resellers, you are generally forced to accept their unsavory business practices and additional risks. Some of the risks associated with CD-key resellers include, but are not limited to, receiving stolen keys and receiving regional keys that must be activated by VPN. The most recent [example of this]( http://unknownworlds.com/blog/beware-shady-key-resellers-and-discount-steam-keys/) happened with a popular game, ""Natural Selection 2."" Over a thousand keys were fraudulently purchased from them, and sold at a discount. All of these keys were disabled by the developer. In-turn, all accounts that had one of those stolen keys associated with it had the game removed from the library without warning.* **The admins agreed with our decision to not allow these shady CD-key reseller sites and I think they will be supportive in getting rid of future promoted links that try to advertise for CD-key resellers.**

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for similar promoted links that break our rules. As can be evidenced by one of the currently promoted links, promoted links that violate our affiliate rule will be allowed to stay. We have talked with the admins about this and it is unlikely to change. As far as we can tell, any promoted link that doesn't specifically endanger the users of the subreddit will be permitted to remain. This is not a reason to be angry at the admins. This is the price that we pay for using their platform. A price that I think is reasonable and am certainly willing to pay. **We absolutely don't have a problem with advertisements.** We welcome more companies to advertise within the subreddit. If we can find a way to benefit a company and the users of this subreddit, that would be fantastic. We even have an promoted link that is doing it right: **BUNDLESTARS**. Where the problem arises is when these advertisements are affiliate in nature. Affiliates create nothing. They leech. They exploit. And they use this subreddit and its users as a means of profit. I would like to clarify that **we are unable to do anything about the promoted links.** They are completely outside of our control. We cannot hide them. We do not get to choose which ones show up. **The promoted links will have no effect on the rules of regular links and comments.** 

The currently promoted link is an unnamed deal aggregator. They do not appear to aggregate any of the CD-key resellers, but they do aggregate deals from the ""big nine"" of digital game sales: Amazon, Gamefly, GamersGate, Gamestop, GetGamesGo, GOG, GreenManGaming, Steam, and Origin. **You should know that every link on the site inserts affiliate information into the links or otherwise redirects you through an affiliate portal, with the exception of Steam and GetGamesGo.** I would hazard a guess that this is only the case because neither of those stores have an affiliate partnership program in place. Gamefly, GamersGate, and GreenManGaming links take you through the Commission Junction portal while the other links will simply append affiliate information onto whatever link you click. **It is likely that all of the sites store these cookies on your system so that future purchases will be attributed to the affiliate marketer that referred you to the site.** The duration of these cookies can be anywhere from one visit, to a day, week, month, or even in extreme circumstances, a year.

The economics of the promoted link work fairly well in favor for the promoter. Barring competition amongst promoted links, a promoter can gain access to a closed ecosystem of nearly 90,000 users interested in purchasing games for as little as $20 a day. Any more than that just buys you a larger slice of the advertising pie, so to speak. If there was only a single link being promoted on /r/GameDeals, the coverage for that link would be 24 hours a day for as long as the promoter is willing to pay. Since there are currently two links being promoted, the coverage for each link it slightly diminished. If another advertiser decides to complete with that link, their coverage is diminished proportionally to the amount each of them pay. Once the promoter gains access to the user base through a promoted link, the process of monetizing those users is fairly simple. As was briefly touched on above, most affiliate marketers' goal is not to sell you on a specific product, but to get their affiliate cookie on as many systems as possible. With no affiliates being allowed on /r/GameDeals, competition and the chance of having their affiliate cookie overwritten is minimal. **Because /r/GameDeals is a relatively closed ecosystem and in conjunction with the low cost of entry and our quickly growing subscriber base, the promoted link is an attractive method of bypassing the rules of the subreddit.** 

To give you an example of why advertising on the subreddit is so attractive, let's take a look at a hypothetical PC download deal from Amazon. I'm unaware of how Amazon rates compare to other affiliate programs, but as far as I am aware, Amazon will pay out a 10% rate on digital download games with their Affiliate Partnership Program. Taking a $10.00 game that is on sale for $2.50, which many of you would agree is not an uncommon experience; an affiliate marketer would get $0.25. It would take only 80 purchases with their affiliate information to make back the investment cost of $20.00 on a promoted link. 80 purchases on a $2.50 game isn't something a community of nearly 90,000 users would struggle with.

For nearly two years, we've exclusively allowed Amazon affiliate links that directly benefit one of three approved charities. These three charities are The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Child's Play, and most recently, Able Gamers. When clicking on, and purchasing from links with one of these three tags attached, they make money. **Working with charities to ensure that affiliate money goes where it is needed has been a proud tradition on /r/GameDeals. We are willing to work with charities to set up additional amazon/non-amazon affiliates that will benefit them.** 

The objective of our subreddit has been, and will continue to be, to save you money. We never felt that it was right for someone's incentive in posting here to directly correlate with their ability to exploit our users for a few bucks.

Thank you,

-The mods.

1341305994.0,278,self.GameDeals,vyz68,[WARNING] Do not buy from Amazon.com (If you aren't from the USA),jeveuxdormir,524,246,290,http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/vyz68/warning_do_not_buy_from_amazoncom_if_you_arent/,"Greetings,

I bought many games and books from Amazon.com, because unfortunately their digital download service isn't available in my country. However yesterday when I tried to buy the Paradox bundles, I found out that I cannot access my account anymore.

I tried to talk with the support and provided my personal billing informations but they told me to wait for an email from the support specialist.

Today I got an email which basically says that they have closed my account and my SO account also and we can do nothing about it.

We can't access the games and books that we have bought anymore, we can't download nor store our steam keys.

Please be aware of this happening to you if you aren't from the USA and bought from them anyway.

I wish you a better day then mine.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**EDIT6** I got my account back, it seems to be a case of security check of double account or the like. Thanks to everyone who have been kind enough to wish me the best and advice me about what I should do, and thanks to the mods who have been very helpful. I think reddit helped a lot in this case thank you all.
I wish you all a good day.

**EDIT5** Some people find the title misleading, I can't edit it unfortunately, so if the mods can come up with a better explicit one, please be my guest.


**EDIT4** I've just contacted amazon.com support by chat and this time around they told me to wait 24h for an answer from an account specialist. (yesterday it was the support specialist that sent me the second email).


**EDIT3** I contacted my bank and apparently, they have no problem with amazon or my account, I can buy with different address without issues. So now I'm going to see what happening with the amazon support.


**EDIT2** It seems that I'm not the only one, read this [LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/vyz68/warning_do_not_buy_from_amazoncom_if_you_arent/c58uyvv)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**EDIT 1**

I'll put some answers here and hopefully it'll be useful.

Q:**Did they give any reasons at all?**

Yes,

* I got this first email ""Unfortunately, we are currently unable to process your order because the billing details provided with your payment method do not completely match the information on file with the card issuer.""

I provided my personal informations to the support with my current address and billing informations.

* Then I got the second email ""This message is to inform you that we have closed your Amazon.com account. We have taken this action because we found this account to be related to previously closed account. In addition, all open orders have been cancelled.""

I believe this email is related to the fact that my SO lives with me, we share the same apartment and IP but have a different account. Anyway, since when can't we have different account for the same household? everyone is allowed to have his/her personal account, it shouldn't be an issue anywhere.

Q:**Did you've any problem with you credit card before? What kind of credit card do you use?**

No, I didn't have any problem before, and I use a MasterCard.

Q:**Did you use a real US address (restaurants, hotels) or did you made it up?**

I always used my real address on the other website but I did made up an address on amazon.com for buying the games.
I know many people used hotels or restaurants address, but I didn't want to do this and cause people harm or something. so I made up an address.

Q:**Did you purchase anything recently? I might be in trouble, however I haven't purchased anything from Amazon in a while.**

Yes, I purchased ""Borderland"" and was about to buy the ""Paradox bundle"" when it happened. I could access my account without any problem until I tried to buy games yesterday. 

Q:**Why do you assume it is related to the fake address?**

The only evidence for me that they have closed my account because of the fake address is this ""Unfortunately, we are currently unable to process your order because the billing details provided with your payment method do not completely match the information on file with the card issuer.""

Q:**Did you get your steam banned and games removed?**

Why would they ban my steam account? I bought all my games legally and the one on amazon are region free. Steam only ban you if you cheat in game or use VPN to buy games from their shop. The worst they can do is remove your game, but they mostly do it if it's RU and is not region free.
We've paid for ours games and they are region free, they can't do anything about it.

Q:**What are you going to do now?**

I'm going to call my bank and see if there is some problems with amazon.com, a redditor told that it might be a protection from my bank due to the fact that I've used a fake address on amazon. If everything is OK with my bank, I'll contact Amazon support again and ask for more informations about this ban.

Q:**Why are you complaining? it was your fault** 

Yes it is my fault, I just wanted to warn other redditor who do the same, so they can back-up their games and books, and I hope for you all that is a single accident and that your accounts are safe, I'll try to see if it is indeed a related to my bank or not.

The subdomain has changed from ""rw"" to ""ww"". ""rw"" will continue to work for a while.**

Hey,

Congratulations on reaching 50,000 subscribers. Next Tuesday will mark a year since we hit 10,000 subscribers. It is surprising to see how fast the subreddit has grown.

**The new feature:**

Flair-based filtering: It has been a long time coming. The most requested feature is the ability to sort, in some way, deals based on certain preferences. While not perfect, given the tools at our disposal, we believe flair-based filtering is the best option. If this option doesn't work out, we can consider creating more individual, specialized subreddits.

* http://co.reddit.com/r/gamedeals : The first is the ability to sort by deals marked with with the Console flair. This will be the umbrella grouping for all non-PC games.

* http://ww.reddit.com/r/gamedeals : The next is the ability to sort deals marked with the Rest of World flair. This will be the umbrella grouping for all non-US deals. It is not required we use this exact subdomain or flair descriptor. We considered using the EU subdomain, but it was already in use.

* http://ph.reddit.com/r/gamedeals : The last is the ability to sort deals marked with the Physical flair. This will contain all games that are not digital.

At this time, it was decided to test the system with a limit of 3 filters. We determined that trying to allow all possible filters resulted in increasing complexity. As a technical explanation, the inability to use the AND operation severely limits what the system allows us to do. The most critical conflicts occur when categories aren't mutually exclusive. I would like to thank /u/Alphanos for help determine whether a complex or simple system would work best.

[Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) with ""never-ending reddit"" is recommended for use with this feature. As a technical explanation, we hide the links that do not fit the criteria. Because we don't have access to anything other than CSS, this is the extent of our abilities. 

Note: You may see empty pages when you go to the filter links. Once flairs start to be applied, you should see some entries. 

**Community Feedback:**

1. How do you feel about reposts? I consider there to be two primary types of reposts:
 * Reminder posts: Any post that serves the purpose of reposting a deal on purpose to bring it to the communities attention again.
 * Incidental reposts: The reposts that happen when multiple people all submit the daily deal and none of them are deleted by the submitter.
 
 Right now, we don't take action against any kind of repost. With the number of subscribers only becoming increasingly larger, I can only see the number of reposts becoming larger.

2. How do you feel about Deal Indexing Sites? We've recently been receiving a fair amount of queries into ""Deal Indexing Sites"". An example of one of these sites would be Cheapshark. A user had previously submitted a roundup of these sites and we removed it because some of the sites contained links to affiliates. We understand that a list of these types of sites could be useful to the community, but remain wary of becoming a gateway for affiliates.

Please feel free to submit submit feedback or your own questions.

Thanks,

-Adam

There are over 1000 games on sale. That's a lot to sift through. If there's a game on sale that you recommend (let's say, under $10), write up a comment that explains why you'd recommend it (a few sentences or more!). Try to recommend hidden gems instead of items that are already up here. List the price, and link to the game. I'll sift through some of the best and add them to the Community Picks list below. Please remember to keep things friendly. If you disagree with a comment, explain in detail why, and what you'd recommend instead. Comments that are intentionally rude or those that add nothing positive to the discussion will be removed without warning.

tl;dr: Find a game (Under $10) that you like. Write a bit about it. Post!

**OnLive access not part of the Humble Store purchase**

**All games have Steam keys and DRM-free copies upon purchase, except possibly Wanderlust and Chivalry**

**Steam prices only confirmed for the US and Canada, other regions may get a better or worse discount from the Humble Store as opposed to Steam**


Again, a reminder that the Humble store gives 95% of the price to the devs, whereas Steam gives the standard 70%. [Source](http://www.edge-online.com/news/humble-store-revenue-split-preferable-to-steam-and-gog-says-phil-fish/)

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale, for whatever reason. Just let me know if you spot any and I will correct them.

You might have woken up to find your order has been canceled. Tony, our Amazon rep on reddit posted this in /r/SimCity - 

&gt;Hey guys, I just saw this note and saw this issue (I was at comicon all day). For 100% transparency here is the mistake that led to this issue. Note this was absolutely a mistake, and orders that were did not use CAGROCKS were cancelled as well. On Thursday we learned that there would no longer be a pre-load for SimCity. In response I set up a mass mail to go out to every customer who had pre-ordered the game up until we found out there wasn't a pre-load anymore. When I filed this request, I copy/pasted a previous request for a mass mail, in this previous request the words ""also please cancel all of the attached orders"" (we had an issue with a product previously that we had to cancel/refund orders on because the product never shipped). So, when sending the email out, letting customers know there was no pre-load, we also cancelled all the orders. Again, this was totally my bad. Cheers, Tony

Seems to me the best way to get results is to ring 8664390310 or get them to ring you, and they can apply the discount directly to your account again.

Any non Americans worried about them throwing a fit over you not being american, I phoned up with an incredibly Northern English accent, spoke to an Irish guy, and he applied the code for me with no questions. I even gave him my English billing address. Phoning 8664390310 with US selected through Skype was free also.

1356801113.0,242,self.GameDeals,15moog,PSA: Gamersgate will not provide serial keys for legitimately purchased Bethesda published titles until mid-January,KanjiKado,416,174,294,http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/15moog/psa_gamersgate_will_not_provide_serial_keys_for/,"After pulling all the Bethesda bundles and claiming they were out of serial keys, they put Doom 3: BFG Edition on sale yesterday. Since GMG won't accept my Paypal and it already went on sale on steam, Gamersgate looked like my only option to get this game at the sale price. Once I checked out and waited for their system to give me a serial key, I was informed [they were all out](http://i.imgur.com/eYl9K.jpg).



Nowhere on [the game's sale page](http://www.gamersgate.com/DD-DOOM3BFG/doom-3-bfg-edition) does it mention they are out of keys, and since it was on sale and displayed on their front page I assumed they would be offering keys for the game. My 15 dollars are tied up and now I can't play Doom over the weekend like I had planned.



Today, they have [Skyrim](http://www.gamersgate.com/DD-ES5S/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim) on sale for the same price as Steam did. I want to make sure anyone buying it from them because they passed on the Steam sale thinking they would get it as part of the bundle knows what they're in for.

Make sure you give it a look, if you haven't already. If you participated, thank you!

Today is the final day of the Summer Sale. It's a really good time to buy that game you were debating about buying, if you haven't already done so.

**Please post suggestions only! You may respond to a comment with a question.  Please ask questions about what to get in the main summer sale thread or over in /r/GameDealsMeta.**

We want to hear more suggestions. So, here's the encore community suggestion thread. Same rules as before.

There are a lot of games on sale. Some haven't gotten much attention. Some have, thanks to people like /u/bryanhbell and his [Deepest Discounts](/1i9w3w) posts, which have been a great resource for budget-priced games on sale right now.

Here are the (loose) rules in this thread

- *Please explain*, with as much detail possible, why the game is your pick
- *Only one pick per top-level comment*
- **Please link to Steam game page!**
- Please no F2P, DLC (alone), and items that aren't on sale
- Try to choose games under $10 (or your country's equivalent)

Please remember to keep things friendly. Abusive comments will be removed.

Reddit ""Contest Mode"" is enabled in this thread, so post order is randomized, and scores are hidden.

As usual if you have any suggestions for these threads please, feel free to tell me (preferably in a private message as sorting through the hundreds of top level comments that fill my inbox is difficult).

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale, for whatever reason. Just let me know if you spot any and I will correct them.

Since there seems to be some confusion on how I list franchise packs I will explain. If there is a franchise pack, like the Assassin's Creed franchise pack, then I will list the price of it if it is available in all major regions (US, CIS, RU, EU, UK, AUS). If there is no franchise pack, or if the franchise pack is region specific (like GTA's from yesterday) I will just list the price of the game in the image shown on Steam and link to the franchise page, which usually has today's deal at the top. Sorry for the confusion!",,False,self,t5_2qwx3,1356936849.0,,,True,t3_15oi07,http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/15oi07/steam_holiday_sale_day_11/,

We had a suggestion come to us to open up a thread where we all could talk about our top picks from the sale.

There are a lot of games on sale. Some haven't gotten much attention. Some have, thanks to people like /u/bryanhbell and his [Deepest Discounts](/1i9w3w) posts, which have been a great resource for budget-priced games on sale right now.

Here are the (loose) rules in this thread

- *Please explain*, with as much detail possible, why the game is your pick
- *Only one pick per top-level comment*
- **Please link to Steam game page!**
- Please no F2P, DLC (alone), and items that aren't on sale
- Try to choose games under $10 (or your country's equivalent)

Please remember to keep things friendly. Abusive comments will be removed.

Reddit ""Contest Mode"" is enabled in this thread, so post order is randomized, and scores are hidden. This will help to make sure that all comments will be seen.",,True,nsfw,t5_2qwx3,False,,,True,t3_1inebh,http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/1inebh/steam_summer_sale_your_picks_community/,

As usual if you have any suggestions for these threads please, feel free to tell me (preferably in a private message as sorting through the hundreds of top level comments that fill my inbox is difficult).

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale, for whatever reason. Just let me know if you spot any and I will correct them.

Since there seems to be some confusion on how I list franchise packs I will explain. If there is a franchise pack, like the Assassin's Creed franchise pack, then I will list the price of it if it is available in all major regions (US, CIS, RU, EU, UK, AUS). If there is no franchise pack, or if the franchise pack is region specific (like GTA's from yesterday) I will just list the price of the game in the image shown on Steam and link to the franchise page, which usually has today's deal at the top.

Amazon requires that you have a US BILLING ADDRESS to purchase from them.

Reposts of Amazon games on sale will be removed during the sale.

If Amazon price matches a Steam game on sale - which they might - that is okay for posting on its own.

As the sale develops more information will be added each day and each day's posts will include an update of what goes on sale that day so if you check for these threads daily you will not miss anything.

As I'm sure many of you have noticed, we've recently had some issues regarding the submittal of non-deal posts. Some examples of these include Tony's post on E3, users requesting deals on certain products, and reminders to check your email/account/etc. While we understand that some of the subscribers of the subreddit don't mind these types of submissions, we feel that these submissions stray outside of the focus/scope of the subreddit. Most of the users of the subreddit subscribe for deals on games and as the subreddit increases in size, the amount of clutter will likely increase if no action is taken to prevent it. Whereas subreddits like /r/games, /r/gaming, and /r/truegaming are all relatively general subreddits, I consider /r/gamedeals to be a more focused subreddit. Going forward, the other moderators and I think we should try to keep that focus. As it is, it is easier for someone to subscribe to another subreddit than it is to hide submissions that they aren't interested in.

-Adam

Note: This isn't a slight against anyone. The issue just came to a head today and we felt that we should address it before people started wondering why some posts were removed.

As /r/gamedeals grows more popular, we're starting to see more independent retailers posting their own deals, asking if it would be OK for them do so, and users submitting deals from questionable sites. We consider the safety of the people who use this subreddit to be our number one priority, but we also realize that in trying to protect the users of the subreddit, we may be excluding good deals from legitimate retailers. Unfortunately, the only way to confirm the legitimacy of some of these retailers is to contact the publishers and hope for a response. Thus far, we've been unable to get a response from publishers. We have been in contact with a few retailers and they have been able to slightly quell our apprehension by revealing what appear to be legitimate distribution channels that, in turn, get their keys directly from the publisher. In the past, we've removed these sites because couldn't verify their legitimacy and we wanted to try to err on the side of caution for the protection of the the users on /r/gamedeals. We'd still like to be cautious, but we would like to take a slightly new approach: **cautious, but fair.** Many of the sites that we use today we're not trusted at one point, but through consistently good deals and service, they have been able to prove themselves. I believe that we need to allow other retailers this opportunity.

The policy on CD key resellers will remain unchanged. If we have reason to believe that keys were acquired illegitimately, keys require a VPN to activate, or a site will not deliver the ordered product, deals from that site will be removed. If the community overwhelmingly determines that a site it unsafe, deals from that site will be removed. The idea is to allow upvotes, downvotes, and comments to determine the fate of a deal as much as possible without compromising the safety of the people on /r/gamedeals. Currently, I believe the presence of a deal on the subreddit signifies to most users that we have approved the deal or that the deal is safe. This is not what we intended. Going forward, we will, unfortunately, be unable to guarantee the safety of any accounts you attach questionable keys to. We ask that you to carry a little skepticism for the unknown names, and keep in mind the old adage that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

We'd like to have this policy change run on a trial basis. We will revisit this topic in about a week and decide if it is the best course of action for the subreddit. As always, we would like your feedback on this change. If you would prefer we keep a hard line on removing unknown independent retailers, then we will continue to do so. If you like this new ""cautious but fair"" approach, then great, let us know below. We take your comments seriously and it's your say above all else that matters to us. Continue to use the report button if you question the legitimacy of a site, and please leave a comment or contact the mods (via ""message the moderators"" in the sidebar) so we know why the thread was reported.

**A note to independent retailers:**

While we have generally been accepting of self-promotion, we do have a couple of requirements. If you are self-promoting for a site, we will require you to admit that you are and state what connection you have to the site. We will then give you a flair that identifies you as officially representing that site. Those that violate this will be given a warning and have flair applied to them at our discretion. The community is easily able to recognize deceptive or misleading practices. Using deceptive practices such as sock/shill accounts will reflect negatively on you and will be dealt with harshly, up to the banning of your site.

Will you be our valentine?

**Notes**

Amazon requires that you have a US BILLING ADDRESS to purchase from them.

Reposts of Amazon games on sale will be removed during the sale.

If Amazon price matches a Steam game on sale - which they might - that is okay for posting on its own.

As the sale develops more information will be added each day and each day's posts will include an update of what goes on sale that day so if you check for these threads daily you will not miss anything.

**Notes**

Amazon requires that you have a US BILLING ADDRESS to purchase from them.

Reposts of Amazon games on sale will be removed during the sale.

If Amazon price matches a Steam game on sale - which they might - that is okay for posting on its own.

As the sale develops more information will be added each day and each day's posts will include an update of what goes on sale that day so if you check for these threads daily you will not miss anything.

+-+-+-+-+-+- **Information** +-+-+-+-+-+-

**How can I get these credits?**

They were only available when purchasing a game late last year at Amazon.com

**Can I get more credits?**

No.

**Do credits stack?**

No.

**Can I trade / swap to get more credits?**

No. They are attached to your account and untradeable.

**How do I know how many credits I have?**

1 - Search your email for this complete phrase and count the emails: It is our pleasure to let you know that you have earned a $5 credit toward the purchase of select game downloads

2 - **Try** to buy a game. Look to see at the Checkout if any Promo credit has been applied. (Be careful not to buy a game accidentally of course)

(If someone says to use the Amazon widget - it's useless for this)

**Will more games be added to this selection?**

Yes and as soon as dates/deals are known they will be posted.

**Will prices drop even further?**

No idea

**Important!**

**DRM**

Some games are standalone, some are Origin, some are Steam, some are Ubisoft. Read the game page fully before buying if it matters to you. If you buy the wrong one contact Amazon Customer Services and politely explain.

Changes since Day 6:

So you get to see everything I have added a comment to this post - there is just too much for a single post otherwise.

**IMPORTANT**: Some sales, like LA Noire, have a Steam and a NON-Steam option. Be sure to buy the version you want.

Note: Where the sale says 'to December 22' this could mean until the end of the 21st OR the end of the 22nd. So don't wait until the last day.

We've recently had some requests to highlight ongoing/long-term deals in one way or another. Unfortunately, the functionality of reddit doesn't allow for a submission to be ""bumped"" or ""stickied"" to stay on the front page. The only realistic way that I can see this being implemented, with my current technical knowledge and tools at hand, is either using the note: at the top or the sidebar on the...side. I think that this sort of thing would likely work better in the sidebar because there isn't much space to do anything at the top.

I think we should have some restrictions on which deals will be posted in the sidebar because the list could very quickly get out of hand. These are some ideas:

* Have a limit on the minimum number of days a deal would need to run to be put in the sidebar. Most daily deals and mid-week-end deals won't fall off of the front page before the deal ends. **How many days should a deal need to run to be on the list?**
* User submitted or moderator curated? If the list was curated by the moderators, it could end up being a large time commitment, we could miss deals and people might think we are playing favorites. **How should we choose which deals are added to the list?**

I can't think of anything else that I need to add. If you have any questions/ideas/opinions/suggestions/etc. feel free to respond with them.

**Sound good to everyone?**

[AU ONLY]&lt;--sorta",NegimaSonic,223,67,238,http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/14t9g6/ubisoft_free_ac_brotherhood_from_dust_beyond_good/,"Basically I got the information from here:
http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TradersGuild#announcements/detail/1731896787239739529

But I will be copying and pasting with some minor edits in bold:

This promotion is only available in Australia. Alternatively, you can get an Australian to do it for you. **Or keep reading**

You can get Prince of Persia® The Forgotten Sands™, Assassin's Creed® Brotherhood, NCIS - Based on the TV series, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, From Dust and Beyond Good &amp; Evil.

To do this, you will need a verified Facebook account.

None of these titles are Steam redeemable, they are for UPlay”. This will take around 5-10 minutes to complete, but it’s all worth it for free games right? :D

1. Login to your Facebook account (Needs to be verified) @ www.facebook.com **Does not need to be listed as from Australia in your location**

2. Then go [here](http://www.facebook.com/lynx/app_544424275584664?ref=ts), The page should look something like this

3. Fill in all the boxes, fake information is fine. **Phone number field needs to only contain numbers, no dashes or parenthesis for area codes, I used the 10 digit format** When you get to the boxes with the last 4 digits of the first product, pick two from this list here:

• Lynx 2012 - 5550

• Lynx Africa - 2606

• Lynx Anarchy - 5727

• Lynx Anti-Hangover - 0083

• Lynx Click - 4144

• Lynx Cool Summer - 7298

• Lynx Dark Temptation - 4327

• Lynx Excite - 5354

• Lynx Fever - 0090

• Lynx Instinct - 7304

• Lynx Legend - 2872

• Lynx Shock - 0106

• Lynx Twist - 1868

• Lynx Voodoo - 1948

4. Enter any 6 digit number in the “Receipt Number” box. Make it up, could be like 124676. If it doesn’t work on the first try, make up another 6 digit number and try again. **I just copied one of the above numbers and added two random digits**

5. Check the box “I agree to the terms and conditions”, then click “Submit”.

6. Check your email for a code. It should say something like “Your code is: …….”.

7. Now go to shop.ubi.com/lynx2

**Not from Australia and don't want to use a proxy? Then take this tip from &gt;KJH&lt; on Steam**

**"" Dec 10, 2012 @ 8:01am
for those not living in Australia and want this deal, make a tab and use this link to make your store page the Australian store page [clicky](http://shop.ubi.com/store/ubiemea/en_AU/home/ThemeID.8605700/ccRef.en_CA/ccSet.au)""**

8. Click add to cart on one of these games
- Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
- Prince of Persia The Forgotten Sands
- NCIS**&lt;--Warning, this one might be physical copies only. So you might not get one.**
- Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2
- From Dust
- Beyond Good and Evil

9. Then, it should redirect you to your cart. Enter your promo code you received in your email in the “Promo Code” section, then click apply.

10. If you only want one of these games, click checkout. **Skip if you want another game** Enter real or fake information there, then accept the privacy policy and click “Continue”. Then followed by “Submit Order”. The next page should show your serial key for the game you selected.

11. If you want more than 1 of those games, copy and paste “shop.ubi.com/lynx2” in the SAME tab. If you open a new one, this will not work. **I recommend instead going continue shopping. And upon further inspection looking back at the app, I don't even think this is a trick. It says ""Buy 2 Lynx Cans = 3 Free games"". I just happened to pick out 3 games.**

12. Do the same with second product you selected, enter your promo code. If you want more, repeat the process. Make sure all the prices are 0.00.

13. Once your done selecting all your games, click checkout. Enter real or fake information there, then accept the privacy policy and click “Continue”. Then followed by “Submit Order”. The next page should show your serial key for the game you selected. **To help myself out, I grabbed some information from fakenamegenerator that seemed Australian, but I don't think this is necessary. After pressing submit order, it sent me back to my own country's page supposedly, but within 30 minutes, I got my codes. Actually it tried to send me back to my country's page several times in the ordering process but it all appears to have worked out**

Enjoy! 

------

Additional non bolded tips from me because I have a feeling too much bold is annoying. If you're new to uplay like me, then you might be confused how things work compared to something like Steam.You'll get keys sent to you in your email, but there's no where to enter them in uplay. Instead, there will be download links in those emails. You download the games and keep uplay running, eventually there will be some point in the installation process that asks for the key, then it'll add it to uplay. (You may have to enter them in the game AND uplay, I'm not sure if this is necessary, but that's what I did. You should be able to run the game from the Windows ""Games"" folder at first). Also because of this, don't try to trade the codes. 

Note: From Dust may also not work without restarting your computer after an update, I haven't verified this but research seems to indicate this is why I was stuck at the main screen.

If any of this is against the rules, just remove the post. I figure this was similar to the origin code thing from awhile back, and at the very least it IS a deal for Australians. Do this at your own risk, I am not sure if they'll handle it like Origin did if this blows up.

**UPDATE** 11:25 PM US Central: If you entered an alternate email as a ""friend"", check it, it comes with another code! You don't even have to use Facebook again for another code, or you can really give it to a friend who doesn't use Facebook. Special thanks to [distinctvagueness](http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/14t9g6/ubisoft_free_ac_brotherhood_from_dust_beyond_good/c7gcqen)

**UPDATE 2** [Note from Avacyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/14t9g6/ubisoft_free_ac_brotherhood_from_dust_beyond_good/c7gkvtz)

""Just a little point of advice for all people from outside of Australia. I did the same last giveaway, got assassins creed; from Dust; and Ghost recon. A week later my U-Play games where removed from my account (Including stuff i bought!) After contacting Ubisoft , they told me i tried to ""hack"" their launcher...""

So like I said, before even knowing this. **Do this at your own risk if you ARE from outside Australia.** That is all.",,False,self,t5_2qwx3,1355510203.0,,,True,t3_14t9g6,http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/14t9g6/ubisoft_free_ac_brotherhood_from_dust_beyond_good/,

As usual if you have any suggestions for these threads please, feel free to tell me.

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale, for whatever reason.

**Notes**

Amazon requires that you have a US BILLING ADDRESS to purchase from them.

Reposts of Amazon games on sale will be removed during the sale.

If Amazon price matches a Steam game on sale - which they might - that is okay for posting on its own.

As the sale develops more information will be added each day and each day's posts will include an update of what goes on sale that day so if you check for these threads daily you will not miss anything.

Join others for chat about games on irc.snoonet - [details here](/1blyks)

As the title would suggest, you need a MasterCard. And as you might imagine, there are a lot of restrictions but most are on TVs and other home theater items.

There are over 1000 games on sale. That's a lot to sift through. If there's a game on sale that you recommend (let's say, under $10), write up a comment that explains why you'd recommend it (a few sentences or more!). Try to recommend hidden gems instead of items that are already up here. List the price, and link to the game (make sure that you remove unauthorized affiliate tags, or AutoModerator will eat your post). I'll sift through some of the best and add them to the Community Picks list below. Don't be offended if your game doesn't make the list. There's only so much room in this post. Please remember to keep things friendly. If you disagree with a comment, explain in detail why, and what you'd recommend instead (""It sucks!"" is not a valid reason. ""I feel that x in this game is lacking because it..."" is great!). Comments that are intentionally rude or those that add nothing positive to the discussion will be removed without warning.

tl;dr: Find a game (Under $10) that you like. Write a bit about it. Post!
