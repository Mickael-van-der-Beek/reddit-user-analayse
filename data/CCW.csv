I recently got my conceal and carry permit. Up to date, LU has allowed students to carry on campus as long as they do not carry within buildings, but, as of yesterday, they allow students to carry within buildings OTHER than dorms.

To enforce this, you must get a separate permit from the LUPD (police department) for carrying within buildings (15 day max waiting time). After that, any student may carry within buildings (excluding dorms) anytime.

I believe LU is the first to do this. I talked to fellow faculty and students who did and did not carry, and about 95% of them were happy with this change.

I couldn't help but share! If you'd like I can link/post their policy here.

We occupy about 1/8 of the building, and consider ourselves a great part of the reason that crime in our complex is much lower than in the surrounding area. We are **vigilant**.

Today, I was working when my father came in and said ""Make sure you have your gun and come with me NOW."" I trust my dad, so I pulled my carry gun out of the drawer (I take it off at work sometimes), holstered it, and walked downstairs.

He pointed, and I could immediately tell what was going on. Our UPS driver's truck had broken down and his supervisor had joined him. They were working on the truck, on the side that has the gas cap. The way we came out, we were at an angle so I could see both sides. On the other side of the truck were two black males. One was on the ground by the back wheel, and the other was by the back corner of the truck, in what I would call a rather athletic posture. It is a chilly day for the area, but not horribly cold - their dress is something I wouldn't take into consideration on a day like today. 

So basically, the UPS guys were getting cased. 

We walked up to them. The driver knows us well. I told dad to do the talking so I could stay alert. He sounded like Arnold Schwarzenegger: ""There are two men casing you on the other side of their truck. I believe they are going to rob you. Lock your truck, and come with us into our offices."" The guys eyes got really, really big. They didn't know what to do, and I've never seen IRL people take a few steps, then go the opposite way, then take a few steps, rinse, repeat. They finally calmed down, locked their truck, and came in with us. The guys on the other side of the truck took off running as soon as we got inside. One on foot, down a sidewalk. The other into the passenger seat of a car we hadn't noticed - weird plates, but we got them. I later found out that they had been to several other businesses in our building, but had no business and had simply walked in each business, looked around, and left any time they were asked, ""Can I help you?""

1370561100.0,245,self.CCW,1ftrdj,Some observations from my first year of carrying concealed.,smokeyjones666,272,27,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1ftrdj/some_observations_from_my_first_year_of_carrying/,"It's been almost a year since I got my Permit to Carry.  In that time I've carried my only high-caliber pistol - a Sig Sauer P220 stainless - through the heat of summer, the bitter cold of Minnesota winter, and now it's almost summer again.  Here are some of my observations and thoughts.

* Buy a quality holster the first time.  Most holsters that are available on retail shelves appear to be crap.  There's a reason so many of us love our Comp-Tacs, Crossbreeds, and Old Faithfuls.

* Unless you're wearing a tight-ass shirt over your full-frame automatic it is not immediately obvious to anyone else that you're carrying.  Even if you print or your shirt rides up a little bit and gets pinched between the grip and your side, most people will probably assume you have a cell phone or something under there.  Folks tend to assume the innocent and they probably wouldn't see it unless you lifted up your shirt and pointed to it with a bright orange freaking arrow.  Nobody else is thinking about your gun and you shouldn't either.

* Stop thinking about your gun.

* Seriously, stop thinking about your damned gun.  Your restricted body movements make you look silly and awkward.  Swing your arms when you walk like a normal human does, reach for things like a human person does.  You're a human being, not a gun with a human being attached.

* It's okay for things to shift around a *little* bit.  Obviously, you don't want it flopping around or hanging out (a rule that applies to almost anything, really).  As long as your gun is very secure in its holster and can never leave your belt things can be a little loose, just like you should be a little loose.  But don't be *too* loose - you don't want to be that guy who shot himself while taking a dump in the Rainbow Foods bathroom, do you?

* It's not about having *larger* clothing, it's about having the *right* clothing.  If you see a style of something that you like, grab 5 or 6 of the size you want, take them to the fitting room, and try them on with your holstered pistol.  Pants and shirts of the same size can all fit dramatically different, and a little extra time spent here will pay off in greatly-reduced frustration later on.

* An undershirt or tank helps to keep everything in place and helps to camouflage what's underneath.

* Stiffer belts are better.  A fresh new belt will work better than the one you've been wearing for the last 10 years.  A nice stiff purpose-built gun belt will be even better still.

* Winter coats are awesome, but how are you going to feel when you take it off?  Make sure you're comfortable with the clothes you're wearing underneath or you're going to have a real tough time carrying a tray, getting more napkins, taking your kid to the bathroom, or whatever.

* Speaking of kids, if you have small ones remember that they do irritating and unpredictable things when they get bored - like lift up your shirt while you're waiting in line.  Which has never caused a problem for me because people tend not to be very observant.

* Carry something smaller and lighter than a stainless P220.  Seriously, this thing is ridiculously heavy and large.  On the upside, any gun I carry after this is going to feel like a featherweight.

Finally, and I think this might be the most important observation I have to make:

* Get over your fears and carry with one in the chamber.  Seriously, you might as well not be carrying anything at all.  It's likely you won't  have the luxury of that 'quick second' you think it's going to take to chamber a round.  You might not even have both hands free to do it, in which case all you'll have is a chunk of metal in your grasp - not exactly what you signed up for.  Besides, if you need your gun you'll probably be freaking out and won't remember to do it anyway, so do what you can to reduce the number of steps between danger and not-being-dead.  Remember, any modern pistol designed with self defense in mind has multiple internal mechanisms to prevent your gun from going off - which means it just can't happen unless you do something stupid to make it happen.  So get over it.

**TL;DR: Wear a good holster and a stiff belt.  Don't buy larger clothes, buy the right clothes.  Nobody thinks you're carrying a gun.  Put a round in the damned chamber already.  Don't do stupid or careless things...and for chrissakes, don't shoot yourself while you're taking a dump in the Rainbow Foods bathroom.**",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_1ftrdj,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1ftrdj/some_observations_from_my_first_year_of_carrying/,

[x-post from /r/dgu and /r/reactiongifs]",iSpccn,249,49,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1h550y/when_i_found_out_that_my_little_sister_shot_a_guy/,"My sister was at a major mall in a city near where I live. (Location withheld due to legal matters.) She had just got done at Barnes &amp; Noble and was walking outside when this random asshole ran up behind her with a knife, then grabbing her by the shirt, attempted to pull her into that fenced in area where they keep the dumpsters. You know the one I'm talking about. The guy started spouting some shit about, ""If you don't keep your mouth shut, I'll gut you like the fat pig you are."" My sister, having the presence of mind to keep her shit about her in any situation, pulls this semi-auto .380 Ruger from her purse that I bought her for her birthday last year. She puts it to the guys stomach and tells him to drop the knife. He raised it up above his head like he was about to stab her, and she pulled the trigger twice.

Now mind you that a .380 isn't big enough to kill someone outright immediately, but she put two slugs into this guys abdomen. It apparently wrecked some shit internally. Spleen, liver, upper intestines, gall bladder, stomach. She booked it out of the fenced in area and called 911. She called me right after, not even really freaking out.
Anyway, I showed up about an hour and a half after everything went down, (I live an hour away, and was sleeping when this happened), and the Paramedic and EMT on shift for that FD told me she was fine and that she was in the back of a patrol car. Went over to check on her, she was perfectly fine. Said she just had to hang out until the detective showed up to talk to her.

The guy however, ended up going into emergency surgery to repair internal damage for multiple organ trauma. (I bought her hollow points because .380's are notoriously underpowered, and this gives them a little extra effectiveness.) Apparently, both shells mushroomed on impact and shattered internally, keeping all of the kinetic force from the barrel and ended up just bouncing around inside this guy's abdomen.

I don't think there has ever been a day in my sister's life that I have been more proud of her, than I was when I found out how she handled herself in that situation.

EDIT 1: Figured I would add this.  These hollow points not only cause massive internal damage, but they are meant to have almost ZERO collateral damage. I'm glad I didn't hear about her popping a round off in this guy, having it go straight through, and inadvertently hit a small child and kill them.

EDIT 2:For those wondering, [these](https://www.buffalobore.com/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=252) shells are available at most online retailers, and as such, are very easily obtainable.

In the numerous self defense classes that I have taken I have always been told to avoid confrontation and bad situations.


**Situation**: I am leaving the office early to run to a 4pm meeting, I had mistakenly miscalculated how long it was going to take me to get there and was running just a couple minutes late according to the GPS. I know the area I am going to and there is an unsavory part part of town that I have to pass through to get there. Not the worst in our city, but its a 45mph 4 lane road with a couple stoplights that I have been on dozens of time. Being late and rushing I am zigging and zagging through traffic to try to make up a couple minutes of time. Finally I get stuck behind 2 school buses side by side and we roll up to a light that just turned red. I am in a newer car at a stop light with traffic all around me. Looking to my left I see a young kid about 11 or 12 wave at me and come running over to my car smiling. My first reaction was to check that my doors were locked while he made his way over (my windows are already rolled up and I had pulled to within inches of the bus in front of me and I know there is a car right behind me). ""Hey mister, I got off on the wrong stop on the bus. Do you have fifty cents so I can get home or to call my mom?""  
Now this kid looks very sincere and completely non threatening, but I have always had a rule that I donate to charities and not to beggars. Fifty Cents is no big deal, but I just say no and sorry. He persists and gives me ""Please, I just want to go home"". I shake my head and say no. Suddenly my car violently lurches to the side as I hear my door handles pulled on. I look over and see to large men trying to yank my passenger side doors open. I am in broad daylight in the middle of a crowded intersection cars all around me. ""Open the door motherfucker, get the fuck out"" one of them jumps onto my hood moving across to my side, at that same moment I grabbed for my Glock that was in the side panel of my door and brought it up with my left hand while reaching for my seatbelt release with my right.  The guy instantly saw the gun and began to roll off so I begin to look for the other known threat, the other man had been coming around the back of the car to the drivers side and by the time I swept right and back left looking for him he was already running as well. I did notice a piece of metal in his hand that looked like a thin pipe or rebar. 

My mind is blank, adrenaline hasn't even started going yet. They are gone, out of sight the entire ordeal lasted less than 20 seconds. I am left there with other astonished drivers all around probably thinking the same thing WTF. Light turns green a few seconds later, traffic just moves out..... I start to realize the reality of the situation, but what am I supposed to do? My mind goes back to I am late for an important meeting. So I just drive forward and begin to take in what just happened. I put the gun away and debate pulling over. But instead I keep driving.

**Aftermath**: I dial the police on my cell phone while still heading to my meeting. I report over the phone that a child and two large men tried to break into my car while I was at a stop light, but I was able to drive away. They ask if I could give a description and if they had stayed in the area, I told them what I could over the phone which was not much and they asked if I wanted to come give a statement. I simply declined and the operator thanked me for calling it in and that was it. I got to my meeting about 5 minutes late and by then the adrenaline and nerves had completely set in but I got through everything without a problem. 

**Review**: After leaving my meeting I called a friend of mine who is a CCW instructor and told him the story. He was very happy to hear that I was ok and not overly shaken by it, but confirmed that this is a know trick that happens. The kid distracts you and then the big guys yank open your door and hop in forcing you out or in some cases the kid will kick your door really hard if you turn him down to try to get you to jump out of the car which is when they hit you in the head with a crowbar and leave you bleeding on the side of the road. If you don't open up they can smash your window open and then drag you out. 
I never would have expected this to happen on a busy road in the middle of rush hour traffic regardless of the area. These guys were prepared and were very fast, having and knowing that my Glock is always there is probably the only thing that stopped the attack. 

Be safe out there and remember to always watch your surroundings no matter the crowd or time of day.

(x-post from r/guns),ebbycalvinlaloosh,206,24,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1cy0z8/actually_had_to_pull_my_gun_last_night_crazy/,"EDIT: From many comments in r/guns, people have pointed out several things that I should have done differently in this situation. I welcome all feedback, as that is why I posted, but maybe a trip over there will save someone the burden of redundancy.

I was using an ATM at the local branch of my bank. The branch is in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood, but on a well lit, well traveled street and it was only 10pm-ish. This ATM is not inside of a lobby but rather just along the wall of the bank next to the entrance. There was one person using it in front of me and as I waited for him, I noticed a decidedly shady looking individual leaning on the wall about 12 feet to the left of the ATM. He was shady in the sense that he looked like a vagrant, definitely not a guy just waiting for the bus...for the purposes of classification I'll just say he looked like a crack head (though that can be very subjective, I know). Now, I'm a big guy, I can hold my own, I've lived in this city my whole life and it takes a lot for me to get nervous. I've been robbed, had my share of run-ins with unsavory characters, as most inner city residents will have over the course of their time. I say that to say that I'm not overly jumpy or suspicious because I know that most of the wackos on the street are just in their own little worlds and present little to no threat despite their appearance. But when he took a few steps closer to the ATM as I was punching numbers, I paid attention.

He was on my left and I keep my EDC pistol on my right hip in an IWB holster. As I put in my pin, etc, keeping him in my peripheral, I unbuttoned my down vest, lifted my shirt to expose the grip and make my gun more available to me. I think my intent at that point was maybe to draw his attention to what I was doing, see I was carrying. The machine dispensed my cash and I began to walk to my car which was in the parking lot adjacent to the bank. The lot is definitely NOT well lit. I was instantly aware of the fact that he was walking behind me, following me to my car. As I walked, I drew my pistol from my holster, making zero attempt to hide what I was doing. I didn't turn around and I didn't point the gun at him, but he clearly saw and turned around and walked back to the street.

It didn't really hit me what had just occurred until a few minutes later and in hindsight, I should have called the police. But my heart was racing and I was processing what had almost just gone down. I have never taken my gun out of the holster anywhere but at the range. It was very surreal.

I don't know what I would have done if I wasn't carrying. Like I said, I feel confident in my ability to hold my own against this guy but I think my first instinct would have been to get to my car and attempt to avoid an interaction altogether. I have to say, I've never been more confident in my decision to carry almost all the time.

Some background about me: I've been the victim of a couple of violent crimes in my life, and as a result I've come to recognize a lot of gut feelings that you get when you're in danger. A lot of what informed the following decision had to do with those feelings, and that may be hard to convey in text, so just keep that in mind. 

Anyway, last night, I worked a loooong shift, and ended up having to take the light rail home at about 1:30AM. It's about a 25 minute ride, and for a while I was the only one on the train. Maybe 10 minutes in, three guys came in one of the back doors. Right away I knew these guys were trouble. They were younger guys, around my age (22), I guess they were dressed like ""thugs,"" but what made me uncomfortable was more than their fashion; it was something about the way they were acting, hard to describe but they were just really aggressive in the way they treated eachother and walked around. I was standing towards the back, so I was able to keep my eye on them, while they took a seat towards the middle of the car and were basically talking shit to one another. Maybe a minute later (time is hard to keep track of, but I didn't think it was a long time), they all three came up to where I was and started talking to me. They asked me what time it was, and I had just been checking my watch so I told them ""1:40,"" but I think they were trying to get me to check my phone because they looked a little confused and then kept asking if they could borrow my cell phone. This made alarm bells go off in my head, because people in my area got robbed by people who asked for their cell phones just like this. Also, they were a little too close to me, and had this really aggressive look in their eyes; like, more than the normal amount of eye contact you make in a conversation or something, hard to explain. Altogether, I did *not* like the way these guys were making me feel, so I said ""no, sorry, phone's dead"" and excused myself to walk into the next car. I'm starting to get into condition orange at this point, if you're into that terminology. I'm standing in the next car, my back to the seats, and then *they follow me in.*

At this point, I'm feeling *very* uncomfortable. The adrenaline was definitely creeping up on me, and when they came through that door I start getting that fight or flight feeling, almost to tunnel vision. At this point, they're standing TOO CLOSE to me, definitely closer than polite conversation between strangers. They start, for lack of a better word, fucking with me. All three of them talking at me and asking me questions, but I can't really make out what they're saying. They start asking for money. They are definitely in my personal space, almost a foot between their faces and mine (try it yourself, it's not a lot of distance). They do this for a few seconds maybe, I am terrified, my mental ""OH SHIT"" switch has tripped, I swing my left arm out to create some distance with my elbow while clearing the clothes from my weapon (wearing suit jacket, had a G26 IWB) and pull my right arm back and down until it's on the backstrap of the Glock (still holstered). I know they can see what I'm doing and I'm looking at them with a look on my face not ""hard"" or ""badass"" or ""vigilante"" but scared and I say something like (sorry, but I really can't remember my wording) ""STOP. Please do NOT make me do this.""



The looks on their faces changed instantly. They went from aggressive to shifty, still hypermasculine like they were trying to look hard, but definitely not as comfortable. One of them sucked in some air in a condescending way (I dunno if you've seen people do this?) and kind of chuckled like he wanted me to feel like I was crazy/a wimp (hard to explain, but I'm hoping people know what I mean) but you could tell it was a tough guy act. They walked off casually and then got out at the next stop which came up pretty soon (at least it seemed that way to me). The encounter took maybe a minute tops, but it felt way longer. I looked around and took a seat by the back and watched the doors while shitting solid gold bricks on what seemed like the longest ride home of my life.

Anyway, how do people feel about this? Did I act right? Was I being paranoid? Let me know.

It's NOT my personal account, OP was using a throwaway so I'll just go ahead and repost it here.  


&gt;I had to make a throwaway for this one because Reddit has some very polarized views on the situation I'm about to describe.
&gt;Several years ago I was driving back home from school with my little sister for Christmas break. She was in college, I was in grad school, and our hometown was about an hour from the city where we studied. She was driving, I was passenger. About 2/3 of the way home I notice a car coming up rapidly in the rear view mirror, MUCH faster than our speed of 65-70 mph. It was a white Honda Civic, and it wasn't slowing down even though it was almost on top of us. We couldn't (legally) get out of the way because there was a car in front of us and a car to the right of us, and we were in the far left lane. At the last moment, just as I thought the car was going to hit us, it swerves onto the shoulder, goes past us, and then cuts in between us and the car in front of us and slams on the brakes.
&gt;Luckily my sister was alert and we are in a car with very good brakes, so we manage to barely slow down enough to avoid hitting it. My sister lays on the horn and swerves into the now-free right lane to get away from this guy. At this point I am fully alert, wanting to believe that this is just some reckless idiot but realizing that what I just witnessed looked very, very intentional. His next move confirmed my fear: as we move into the next lane he slows down even further and then sideswipes our car.
&gt;Luckily we are in a larger vehicle than his and my sister manages to keep it under control. At this point she is panicking, screaming at me asking what to do. I am thinking a thousand miles per hour, trying to figure out what to do and also trying to figure out just what the everloving fuck this guy is trying to do and why. There is an exit less than a mile ahead, I tell her to stay behind him as best she can and try to get to the exit, leaving him on the highway and unable to follow us. For some reason I will never be able to fully rationalize after the fact, I hold off on calling the police, hoping that we can get away. I guess I figured they couldn't do anything for us at that moment (which is true) and that my sister needed my attention more than anything at that moment. Plus I had his license plate burned into my brain at that point; there'd be plenty of time to talk to the police later.
&gt;The next mile feels like it may as well be 10. There are barely any other cars on the road (probably a good thing), and the maniac in the Civic continues to alternate between trying to brake check us and trying to side swipe us off the road. Luckily (or so I thought), my sister manages to stay behind him all the way to the exit, mostly by swerving back and forth across four lanes as he tries to hit us. I try to tell her to wait until the last moment to get into the exit lane, but she wasn't willing to cut it as close as I would have been. Unfortunately she gives the maniac too much warning, and he swerves over at the true last moment and exits in front of us.
&gt;At this moment I decide it's time to call the police. I also remember at about that time that I have a pistol in my bag in the backseat, a subcompact 9mm (I have a concealed carry license). Of course at this point it isn't very useful and besides that I have no desire to shoot anyone today, not even a crazed maniac. Even so, I reach into the backseat and grab it while 911 is dialing.
&gt;As I'm attempting to describe the situation and our location to the dispatcher, we come up on the first intersection with a red light on the frontage road. The Civic is still in front of us, although he seems to have stopped trying to run us off the road temporarily. I notice that one of the two lanes ahead is both a left turn and a straight-through lane, so I tell my sister to get into that lane in the hope that we can go whichever way the maniac doesn't and get the fuck out of there. At this point I've relayed our location to the dispatcher as well as the fact that I am armed.
&gt;As we move into the desired lane approaching the intersection, the Civic does the same. The light is red as we approach but turns green. Perfect, this is our chance. To my chagrin, the fucker turns to block both lanes and stops.
&gt;At this point, I am almost as scared as my sister is. My mind is racing, reeling from the realization of what I might have to do. If this guy is willing to do all of the things he has done so far, he clearly wants to hurt us. And if he is willing to get out of the car and come after us, he's probably armed. I tell the dispatcher the situation and inform her I'm going to have to hang up. I don't remember what she said after that; I honestly wasn't listening anymore. For a few seconds the car just sits there, and my sister starts to back up to put some distance between us and him. I think to myself that maybe he doesn't have the guts to go through with it, but then I remember he has already tried to kill us and fucked both of our cars up in the process.
&gt;Then the door opens, and he steps out. I'll never forget him: short, overweight bald hispanic guy, looked to be in his mid-20s just like us, wearing an oversized light-blue hoodie and baggy jeans. He looked angry as fuck, and he started to walk toward the car. My mind is still racing, I look one last time for an exit, see that there just isn't one that won't put us in danger if he has a gun (we'd have to drive right past him), and realize that's it. I open the door and get out of the car, remaining behind the door, and start yelling at him. I don't remember exactly what I said, but it was something along the lines of back off, the police are coming, etc. He looks straight at me and keeps walking toward the driver's side (it was midday, I have to assume he could see the my sister though the windshield). I remember up to that point thinking over and over again that this can't be happening, or that he can't be this serious, after all we haven't done anything to this fucker. And then I'm thinking what happens if I shoot this guy? Is it justified yet? Am I going to go to jail for this? Then he starts to reach into his pants, and that's it for me. I'm no longer thinking about the legal implications, or anything like that. All I'm thinking about is my little sister. I raise my gun and fire once, aiming for his lower midsection, the bullet goes high and hits him square in the chest and he drops. He didn't die immediately (I don't feel like going into the details) but he didn't get up and he was motionless before the police got there.
&gt;Of course after all this, as relieved as I am that we are safe and as numb as I am given the unreal nightmare that we just experienced, the first rational thought that creeps into my brain is I'm in a world of trouble for this. I could go to jail. At that point I still wasn't sure that he was reaching for a gun. But it turns out that he was, it was a stolen gun at that, and it was later found that he was both drunk and high on cocaine (which I guess explains why all of this happened, since there is no other explanation). On top of that, one of the motorists on the highway who saw his original attempts to run us off the road called the cops even before I did, although she was older and didn't give them a reliable location so that they could get to us before... it... happened. She did, however, corroborate our story. I was never charged, and beyond having to go through the very lengthy testimony and investigation process there wasn't much in the way of legal implication for me.
&gt;The crazy thing is, when I went back to school I didn't tell anybody about it for a long time. I just didn't think they would understand without the context of being there, that they'd subconsciously think of me as a murderer.
&gt;It's true what they say about the experience of killing someone. No matter the circumstances or the justification, you never forget it and you never get over it. But I will say this: never in the years since have any of the emotions I've felt in connection with this incident ever come close to approaching something I would call remorse. That man tried to kill me and, more importantly, my little sister, and he deserved what happened to him. I would do it again in a heartbeat if I had to, although with the benefit of this experience I would call the cops much earlier in the hope that I wouldn't have to. Honestly though, given the time it took for them to arrive I'm not sure that it could have been prevented even if I'd called as soon as he first sideswiped us.

We'll see what happens...



****Update**** - I dropped the monitor off at the hospital earlier today and stopped by member services to discuss the situation with one of the administrators.  I told her the story as I wrote it here and made it clear that I totally understand their desire to keep everyone safe, but I felt like my privacy was violated.

She stated that HIPAA rules allow security to enter hospital rooms when safety could potentially be compromised, but definitely agreed that the situation was handled very poorly and unprofessionally.  She is going to speak with the security supervisor on his poor handling of my privacy and his poor handling of my firearm, and will be following up with me via written correspondence.  She also said that she was going to speak with the nurse who handled the situation and would advise her to ask future patients to step outside and place their weapons in the car before proceeding with the appointment.

The administrator seemed professional, but she definitely didn't understand concealed carry laws (and I wouldn't expect her to either).  She told me that hospitals and schools are ""off limits"" zones for anyone who has a carry permit, to which I informed her that there is no law restricting valid permit holders from carrying anywhere other than federal buildings.  She thanked me for my time, and I left.

I do plan on following up with the administrator once I receive written correspondence from her.

**Sorry in advance for the long story, but there's quite a bit that happened.**

I was at an appointment at a Kaiser Permanente in Northern California today to get fitted for a holter monitor (to track my heart rate for the next 24 hours), and was carrying my XDS IWB as I typically do.  No big deal, right?  Think again.

Once the appointment started, the nurse asked me to remove my shirt.  I didn't want the nurse to freak out when she saw my pistol when I removed my shirt, so I calmly explained to her that I have a concealed weapons permit and that I was carrying my pistol at that time.  She was super cool about it, and asked me to remove the pistol from my waistband and set it on the counter so that she could prep me for the monitor.  I gladly obliged and set it on the counter facing in a safe direction.  She told me that it was hospital policy to notify security if a patient was carrying a concealed weapon, and stepped out into the hallway to do so.  She returned a few minutes later and said that one of the security officers might want to chat with me, and then began to shave my chest and prep me for the monitor.  We're having a conversation about what I do for work and why I carry, to which I replied ""I work at xxxx company, but don't carry for work reasons.  I carry for my own personal safety.""  She says that she totally understands why someone would want a CCW, and says that her husband is trying to get his too. 

Not even a minute later and all hell breaks loose.

Two security officers appear at the door and proceed to enter the room without permission.  The main security officer sees my gun on the counter, walks up to see what type it is, and then asks to see my license and carry permit.  I gladly hand over the permit, although I'm not too happy that these guys are in the room while I'm shirtless and being prepped for a medical procedure.  The security officers ask why I'm carrying in a hospital, to which I reply ""I have a concealed weapons permit, and it's my legal right to do so.  There are no signs prohibiting firearms on the premises so it's legal for me to carry inside this facility."" (FYI - CA is odd about these rules, and my county technically has a restriction for carrying a weapon in businesses where signs are posted prohibiting firearms).  The officer nods his head, and then asks the nurse how much longer the appointment is going to be.  She says it's only going to be a few minutes more, and that she's cool with my weapon on the counter, and says that the officers can leave the room.  The officers decline to leave, and say that they have to wait and watch me and my pistol until the operation is complete (mind you, the pistol is still on the counter in its holster).  A minute or so later, and the main officer tells me that he received a call on his radio and that he now has to physically hold my pistol in his hand until my operation is done.  I tell him that I'm not comfortable with him touching my weapon, and that he needs to leave it on the counter.  He tells me that I can either leave the building or let him hold it (and since I'm in the middle of being prepped, I can't really leave).  At this point he's already got the pistol in his hand (without my consent), so I told him that he can hold it but he is not to leave the room with my pistol.  He agrees, and continues to watch the nurse prep me.  

Another minute later, and an additional officer shows up with the security supervisor in tow.  All of the officers are now in the room watching me get prepped, and the security supervisor instantly starts off on a tirade.  He grabs my pistol from the first officer and says ""What are you doing in MY HOUSE with a weapon...????""  I look at him and say ""Please be careful, the pistol is loaded.  I have a concealed weapons permit, and it's my legal right to carry in this hospital.""  The supervisor is now dicking around with the gun in the holster, is holding the gun by the muzzle with his hand over the barrel, and is slightly sliding the gun out of the holster.  I'm just waiting for him to launch a round through his hand at this point.  

The nurse finally finishes up, apologizes to me under her breath, and promptly leaves the room.  The supervisor then starts lecturing me about how I'm legally not able to carry in any hospital and how I'm breaking various laws, to which I replied that no such laws exist, and that they should post signs prohibiting firearms if they really don't want people carrying in the hospital.  He realizes I'm not trying to be a total dick, agrees with me, and tells me to never carry my pistol again in his hospital.  He then hands me my gun and asks me to reholster and leave at my leisure.  I'm pretty heated, but I put my gun away and leave without any other words.

Here's a twist though - Later on in the day I run into my friend's mom, who works for Kaiser, and I tell her the whole story.  She laughs, and then proceeds to tell me that the security officers were in violation of patient privacy rules as stated by HIPAA regulation since they entered the hospital room without my consent, and that I should file a complaint through member services as a result.  I knew that they were not supposed to be in the room without my permission, but I didn't realize that there was regulations prohibiting their actions.

So, here's my questions for all of you - Did I handle the situation appropriately?  What would you have done in my shoes?  Should I actually file a complaint with member services against the security officers involved?

TL;DR - Went to Kaiser while carrying, got lectured by a supervisor, and left.  My privacy was violated since they were all in the room.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,1372277673.0,,,True,t3_1gs6xe,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1gs6xe/i_had_the_whole_security_staff_of_kaiser_called/,

A few gungho newbie CCWers with no real world experience may think ""I'm a sheepdog!  My CCW makes me special!  I will run towards the gunfire/screaming and rescue the innocent and punish the wicked!""

Unfortunately, reality is different.  CCWers do not have the thin blue line of silence protecting them if they screw up, instead they will be Zimmermanned in the court of public opinion.  They will also not get paid vacation, free legal representation, and free counseling like cops do, instead they will likely lose their job and their family loses a provider and protector.

It does not address the regular Joe/Jane that just wants to be left alone to protect their family.  IMO, a wannabe civilian playing the sheepdog hero in the mix with current US police (who really consider themselves the ""real sheepdogs"" per the article) is likely to either wind up killed by the police or thrown in jail.

IMO, there is a fourth archetype, which I would submit I am one of - the grumpy badger.  The grumpy badger doesn't care much for sheep in trouble (""not my fight"", he/she says), the sheepdogs generally growl and bristle at the badger because they don't know any better, but if a  wolf is dumb enough to threaten a badger he generally gets his face ripped off.

Someone approached my vehicle while I was at a drive up ATM. Began to draw when person changed their mind when they realized they were noticed. Keep your eyes open.

I had to run by an ATM. I went to a drive up ATM for the convenience at approximately 21:15. The bank is in a strip mall with a gas station that is located at the corner of the lot, and there are 2 drive up lanes in an island between the strip mall and gas station. The gas station can be shady at night but normally not much of a worry. 

I get my card out and notice someone at the gas station walking from a pump towards my car/ATM. Then the person stops, looks, and walks a different direction. I do not know where the person originally came from, did not have a clue if the person was in a vehicle that was at a pump or what the case was. I simply noticed the person paying attention to me. I continue my transaction while keeping an eye on my vehicle's mirrors and the mirror on the ATM a little higher alert than normal. I noticed the same person coming up behind the car. While I'm fully aware that someone could be walking up to the drive up ATM to get cash for a purchase and simply waiting in line, they are approaching in a manner that seemed as if the person were lining up to come between the ATM and my car. 

I was finishing my transaction waiting on my receipt at this point when the person was almost touching my tail light and looking behind, with some nervous hand movements. I start to draw the gun into a ready position on my side without brandishing in an obvious or threatening manner. I'm keeping my hands in the vehicle at this point to not open the opportunity for the person to grab them. I see a mannerism I'm really not ok with from the person, kind of a fake run motion for lack of better description, when at that point I spoke up. I have a deep voice that carries well, so I knew I would be heard and hoped I would draw attention. I simply stated ""You are way too close to my vehicle, you need to give me some space."" At that point, the person was startled and moved at a quick pace, not a run, towards the corner of the strip mall. Away from the other ATM and the gas station all together. 

I don't know what the person's intentions were, I know what it seemed though. I feel like I narrowly avoided a snatch and grab robbery. I'm just happy I didn't have to involve my weapon in the situation or become involved in any type of confrontation.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,1371435418.0,,,True,t3_1ghlhw,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1ghlhw/this_just_happened_stay_aware_of_your_surroundings/,

My jacket is cut pretty long so it covers even while I am fully crouched.  One sunny afternoon I was running late and let my speed creep high enough to catch the attention of the State Patrol.  I see the patrol car come flying up on me and then the wonderful sight of blinking blue lights.  “Sigh, there goes my insurance rates” I thought as I slowed and pulled over onto the shoulder.  My next thought was how to I make the officer feel comfortable and in control of the situation?  I know how I handle it when I am in the car, but what to do on my bike?  So I took off my helmet and gloves real fast and calmly interlocked my fingers on my head and waited.  The officer walks up and says “Good Afternoon, sir you don’t have to do that”, I reply “I have a CC and a weapon on me” and as expected the officer takes that one step back and his hand drops down to his service weapon.  “And that” I say while pointing with my elbow, “is why I have my hands on my head”.  The officer actually grinned a little and told me to go ahead and drop my hands, I asked him if he would like to secure my weapon while we did our business and he thanked me and took my S&amp;W MP 40 back to the cruiser.  We go through the whole license and insurance check and he gives me a warning.  When he was returning the pistol he asked me how I liked it since it was still a relatively new model.  We spent about 15 minutes on the side of the interstate talking pistol preferences (he was a glock guy) and he even spent a little time seeing how my S&amp;W felt in the hand and how it pointed before we went our separate ways.  I sometimes wonder if anyone passing by got freaked out by the sight of that officer pointing my (empty) pistol into field as he was checking it out?  Or if my actions at the beginning of the stop helped get me out of a ticket?

TL,DR -  chatting guns with a cop during a traffic stop :D

But it seems to me that whenever I see a post about someone retelling a story of an encounter theyve had with their CCW a large majority of the posts are uber-critical and most seem to say ""well you shouldn't have gotten yourself into that situation anyway"". 

That line of thinking annoys me. It's true that we should take all reasonable measures to avoid situations where violence could occur but to sit back on your computer chair and stick up your nose and say ""well just don't get in those situations"" seems pompous at best.

Isn't the point of this subreddit to talk about the purpose of carrying a concealed weapon and to encourage others in safely doing this? Nobody wants to get in a situation where their weapon is necessary but things DO happen, and alot of them are UNAVOIDABLE. 

There's been some posts of CCW'er's sticking up for/defending people that could potentially be in danger that have come under alot of fire from people in this subreddit that seems unreasonable. I carry to protect myself and the innocent around me. Not to sit in my car or run away if something bad befalls someone else. Nor do I go around looking to play Policeman.

I am a private citizen who is legally carrying a firearm (concealed or otherwise). I have every right, and dare I say obligation, to help those who cannot help themselves. Take the story about the 13yr old on the schoolbus that's been on the news lately. That bus driver SHOULD have gotten physically involved and removed those kids that were beating him up. Worrying about some legal ramification that could come of that is just inhumane. I'm sorry but when situations like that occur it's just common decency to intervene. The courts can sort it out later, but I couldn't live with that on my conscience (if I didnt help out a person in trouble).

As background, I'm from Missouri where I am NOT required by law to inform the officer that I'm carrying.

My wife and I bought a new car a few weeks ago and it's much faster than the tiny Kia we used to drive, so I've had trouble keeping my speed in check when there aren't other cars around to pace me.  Sure enough, I looked down at my speedometer as I passed the patrol car and I was doing 60 in a 45.  I see him pull out behind me and I knew I was getting pulled over, so I pulled into the nearest parking lot and grabbed my wallet out of my back pocket so I wouldn't have to be reaching for anything while he was near me.  With both front windows fully rolled down, I grabbed my driver's license and my CCW permit and rested both of my hands on top of the steering wheel.

When the officer approached, I handed him both ID cards and said something to the effect of ""Officer, I'm licensed to carry and I have it on me.  This is the first time I've been pulled over while carrying, so I'm not sure how you want to handle it.""  He glanced at my CCW permit and asked me where my gun was, I told him it was on my right hip, and he said ""That's fine.  Keep your hands off yours and I'll keep my hands off mine"" and took my IDs back to his car.

A few minutes later he comes back (my hands still sitting on top of the steering wheel) and says ""I'm going to let you off with a warning because you handled your CCW perfectly.  Thanks for letting me know right away and keeping your hands on top of the wheel.  It makes me feel safer"" (I'm sure having my wife and one year old son in the car helped too).  I thanked him and told him I'd watch my speed and that was the end of it.

I was super nervous and my wife said she could hear it in my voice, but after reading all the horror stories on here I was half expecting to be disarmed and frisked.  I was very pleased with how everything went, especially since I was fully expecting to be stuck with a couple hundred dollars in fines -- this is the first time I've ever been let off with only a warning.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_1gyu8f,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1gyu8f/first_time_pulled_over_while_carrying/,

She is alive, but lessons have been learned.",runanteloperun,155,26,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1idskf/my_sister_was_stabbed_this_weekend_she_is_alive/,"This past weekend my little sister was jumped while walking home from work in New Orleans.  She was half a block away from her work, and about 250 feet away from her apartment.

The assailant came at her from behind, made a demand for her purse which she complied with, and then he proceeded to stab her twice in the arms, twice in the abdomen, and twice in the legs.

Sufficed to say, she is lucky to be alive.  I received word Saturday morning when I was awoken by a call from my mother who told me what had happened.  Needless to say, it is not a call that I wish anybody ever has to endure.  The fact that she is alive, and that I didn't hear that my little sister was stabbed to death in New Orleans is pure chance, and I feel very fortunate to have the ability to talk to her.

As somebody who carries daily, I recognize that there are very real dangers in the world.  Not all people are nice, and care about their fellow man.  I think before this event, my family had thought I was half crazy or at the very least weird for carrying a firearm.  Now they completely understand.

My sister is leaving New Orleans tomorrow for good, and coming home to the relative safety of our home state.  We are fortunate to live in the area where we do, that while not perfect, is leaps and bounds better than that shithole in Louisiana.

Anyways, as soon as she gets back, I am going to teach her how to shoot.  I am going to show her how to defend herself so that if this ever happens again, she will at least have a chance and/or ability to defend herself.  I want the knowledge that my sister will not be killed for $15, 3 tampons, and 2 chapsticks.

While I've had relatives die, this is the closest I have come to having a member of my immediate family die.  I will appreciate my family, and value them and the time I get to spend with them more than ever.  I guess you don't realize what you have til it's gone, or almost gone.

**tldr;** Sister stabbed in New Orleans, Alive and doing ok, will have to deal with the anguish of physical, emotional, and fiscal issues as a result of some shitbag attacked her.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,1373942472.0,,,True,t3_1idskf,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1idskf/my_sister_was_stabbed_this_weekend_she_is_alive/,

I was told to not carry there but that no signs would be posted and that it was just between us and it would not go anywhere...


Well today (four weeks later) I was sat down by my supervisor and basically told that she did not feel safe around anyone that even owns a gun after the CT incident and that she wanted to make sure I was not carrying. I informed her that I was not carrying in accordance with our original discussion and was not obligated to present my gun or my permit to anyone that is not a uniformed police officer. She then went on an anti-gun bullshit fest that, like all anti-gun claims, was simply ""I feel insecure, I don't feel safe, evil black rifle"".

I did not even bat an eye. I presented a few real statistics and said that I tolerate her feelings and wishes to the extent the law requires, and that I do not argue with anti-gunners because I know it is pointless to try and convince anyone otherwise.

But once again, when confronted with real evidence, the anti-gunners revert to doing that they always do, **projecting their own insecurities** as if it means something. I'm not going to leave the job because of this but I am sorely dissapointed.

A few nights later a friend invited me out to a bar in a sketchier neighborhood.  I had been toying with the idea of carrying since I received my license, but had been putting it off since I didn't own a very concealable gun or an IWB holster.  While I was getting ready that night, it didn't even cross my mind.

As I put my keys in my car's ignition, I got a really weird, paranoid feeling.  Chills, clenching jaw, stomach dropping, hairs on the back of my neck standing to attention like a soldier on parade, the whole shebang.  I walked back inside and grabbed my full size pistol.  As an afterthought, I put on a light jacket to cover it.

My friend asked why I wouldn't take off my jacket in the bar, but I laughed off the question, and kept having a good time.  The end of the night rolled around, and I left my wallet with my friend to settle the tab while I stepped outside to smoke.  I noticed a rather sketchy man approach from down the street, but didn't think anything of it, since he fit the area.  The guy came right up to me and demanded that I give him my wallet, watch, and phone.  I backed off down the side alley trying to put distance between us, and hoping he'd just go away, or I could go back in through the side door.  I was trying to tell him that I didn't have anything on me, but it's fuzzy now and I'm not sure what I said exactly.  Regardless, he said something along the lines of ""I don't fucking care."" and started digging in his pocket for something.  There was roughly ten feet between us when I saw his boxcutter come out, but my gun was already clearing my holster.

I can still see his eyes get real big so damn clearly, and the sound of that boxcutter clattering onto the ground as he ran off is something I'll never forget.  Sometime between drawing my gun and him running off I froze.  My friend got nervous when I was gone for too long and found me standing there holding my gun down by my leg, shaking.

I'm not sure what I'm looking to get out of this post, maybe some reassurance that I'm not a coward?  Or some tips on how I could of handled it better?  The question I keep asking is, ""Could I have pulled the trigger if it came to that, or did I really freeze in that crucial second, and should be dead right now?""

**Edit:** For everyone talking about drinking and carrying, I was at the bar for around 4 hours, and had one scotch and one beer.  I'm not defending myself drinking and carrying, just giving you what happened and more details on the events leading up to my incident.

Just putting up the quick story as another data point of how I handled the stop and how it turned out.,withoutapaddle,133,20,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/164hcj/stopped_by_police_while_carrying_everything_went/,"Location: Outskirt suburbs of Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN (20-30 miles outside of central metro area)

So, I got stopped for a burnt out headlight a couple nights ago.

I was carrying IWB on my right hip at the time.  Officer asked for license, and I handed him both my license and CCW permit together.  This is what I was taught was the best way to inform so as to never have to say anything along the lines of ""I've got a gun"" to a police officer.  I am not required to inform in Minnesota unless asked, but I've heard it's better to be upfront about it, especially because officers here on reddit have said it puts them at ease because when they see the permit they immediately know you are not a felon or diagnosed with any serious mental issues.  The likelihood of the traffic stop turning dangerous immediately drops to a very tiny percentage when they know you're eligible for a permit to carry.  Not to mention permit holders commit crimes on a much smaller scale than the average citizen... but I digress

The officer looked at both and asked me if I had my weapon and where it was.  I said ""Yes, it's in a holster on my right hip.""

That's where the gun conversation ended.   No fuss, no disarming, stepping out of the car, etc.  He said he'd check my license and be back.  He returned and asked me to make sure I get my headlight fixed as soon as possible.

End of traffic stop.  No problems.  I was surprised he didn't even say anything like ""Just keep your hands on the wheel, please"".  The officer was about as professional and respectful as he could be.  I *did* keep my hands on the wheel the whole time, just because it's a good idea in general.

So, just sharing this data point with you guys, especially for those new to CCW who haven't had their first experience with the law while carrying, and might be nervous about it.  I know I was after seeing horror stories of people being disarmed, muzzle swept by their own weapon, or screamed at like a criminal.

Please contact him and let him know that you stand for freedom, and you want him to do the same. There is no reason that we should be so far behind others in the way of rights, especially gun rights!

UPDATE 06/12/13: It looks like Perry has added open carry to the special session. The bill was filed yesterday (06/11) and is listed under [83(1) HB 56](http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=831&amp;Bill=HB56).

On Friday night I went downtown with some friends, about halfway through the night everybody decided we should go dancing. I was stoked to dance, but was a little worried about my gun in that situation, but I didn't have a car or anywhere to put it so I just put my faith in my holster. (De Santis Sof Tuck, can't say enough about how much I like this holster).

After dancing for part of the night one of the girls in our group patted me on the back and hit me right on the gun. She grabbed it and stared at me and gave me a stern talking to about carrying a gun, and how I should not carry in the presence of this group of people because some people don't like guns.

Well after she got very upset on Friday night about me having a gun I figured whatever, I can keep it in my truck if we end up hanging out again.

The very next day the same group of people decide to hang out, and knowing she will be with the group I decided to keep my gun in my truck. Halfway through the night we go driving way out into the woods to star gaze and act as general miscreants. We get a considerable distance away from the vehicles and somebody hears a group of people in the woods yelling at our group and being moderately belligerent. This girl runs up to me and asks me to check it out because I have a gun. I told her I left it in the truck because I wanted to make some people feel more at ease, and she freaked out and told me I always needed to carry a gun. After a short discussion she finally said she was ""okay"" with people carrying guns as long as they are ""the good guys"". 

Anyway, after she hears me say I left it in the truck she tells me I should carry at all times, and all places! I thought it was comical how in 24 hours she went from being angry that I was carrying to now telling me I should carry.

We went back to the vehicles and went back to the town with no encounter or issues, but some people were very scared and a couple of them made comments about wishing someone was carrying a gun, to which I just giggled because I usually do, and they just don't know.

I guess in the end I am just glad some people are changing their minds, and I have been able to help in that process.

(x-post from /r/progun),rivalarrival,120,19,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/16yv1s/nra_numbers_4_million_licensed_concealed_carriers/,"[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/16yra8/nra_numbers_4_million_licensed_concealed_carriers/)

Concealed Carriers typically carry a firearm with standard magazine capacities of 13 to 21 rounds. /r/guns recommends a Glock 19 (15 round standard capacity) as the first handgun a person should purchase. Any magazine ban is going to have huge effects on concealed carriers.  

Vice President Biden has commented extensively on hunters and sportsmen, as well as several ""categories of individuals prohibited from having a gun"". I have not yet heard a single mention of concealed carriers. 

We number more than twice the members of the NRA, but we are being completely ignored by the administration. Why? Because they know that if they acknowledge us, they have to acknowledge that these so-called ""high capacity"" magazines are carried and used more often by law-abiding people to stop crime than by criminals to commit crime. They will have to acknowledge that magazine bans will make it more difficult for us to defend ourselves, but will do nothing to stop violent criminals. In short, they lose any real credibility in asking for magazine bans as soon as they recognize us.  

Let's force them to recognize us. When you [write your representatives](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml), make sure to tell them to talk about us, talk about how many we are, how well trained we are, how unlikely we are to commit any sort of crime, let alone a violent crime.

Went to the food co-op. Had a conversation about forest fires. Paid for my food and left. Handgun didn't spontaneously shoot anybody.

Drove to Costco. A couple of people cut me off in traffic. I didn't whip out my gun and show them who was boss. I got to Costco and did my shopping. One guy was VERY rude to me in the paper products aisle. I just smiled, apologize and moved on.

Filled up my car on the way home. Standing there at the pump all sorts of people walked or drove by and somehow none of them got shot.

Stopped at the bank and went in to deposit a check. Nothing happened. Transaction concluded.

Drove home. I didn't do a drive-by on a neighbor who won't cut his damn lawn.

Yeah, it's a circle-jerk kind of thing to post to a CCW sub-reddit, and I know that ""nothing happened"" is not news. Only tragedy and splashy things are news, because people are fascinated when things go wrong, and things going OK becomes boring.

I guess I'm a bit more aware of the non-events because of a bunch of interactions I've had with people with week, both online and off, about concealed carry. I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that you can put gun rights into the same category as religion with people.

I went out to get my girlfriend some food from our local fast foodery (mcD's). It's about a 5-7 minute walk and even though I purposely avoided the ghetto on my walk I still had an encounter. I'm walking up a cross street (broad daylight roughly 2pm) and I get to the end and 3 guys walk out from the corner and block my way.

I go to move around them and they move infront of me again. The one directly infront of me says ""hey homie, you got any cash to spare on you?"" and I replied ""No, I don't carry cash with me..."" he comes back with ""That's cool, gimme your wallet and your phone anyways"". I stepped back and he started to reach in his pocket and I said ""I think you're making a mistake, just let me go and nothing needs to happen"" he took a step toward me now with a steak knife in his hand and said ""I'm not going to ask you again, give me your fucking wallet or me and my boys are going to fuck you up"" as he was stepping forward I reached for my pistol and raised it up and took a defensive stance and told him not to move towards me again. He backed up and said ""Oh shit dis nigger got a gun!"" then ran off. That was all that happened but by this point, it doesn't phase me anymore and I just go into auto pilot. The kicker is that there were people watching this whole altercation and didn't say or do anything. I found a policeman on the next corner and told him what happened and he called it in but basically I got told nothing was going to be done about it.

This is the third time I've had to draw on someone while living in this area and every time it happens I have never been happier and more relieved to have gotten a CCW. I do not let my GF go anywhere by herself and I always walk her to and from wherever she needs to go for this reason.

On the way to the kitchen I see the front door slowly, slowly opening. I stand there for a split second baffled and very afraid at what I am seeing. My gun is safely locked away upstairs and I have nothing but bare hands. 

Holy crap! This is it! But I am unprepared. My gun, training and practice at the range are all useless in this moment. My hands are empty.

In 20/20 hindsight I should have quickly and quietly gone back upstairs - it would have removed me physically from the situation, avoided direct conflict and given me time to get my gun. But I didn't do that when faced with the actual circumstances. I simply reacted out of fear and adrenaline. That's one lesson learned.

Still, totally unarmed and in my PJs, I pulled the door open quickly to see a shadowed figure in a hoodie. I yell ""what the F---, what are you doing?"" I had the brief advantage of surprise, and so I reflexively landed a heavy solid punch to the throat. The person staggered back, and in the moonlight I could then see a bit more clearly.

It's our 15 yr old son...he had apparently snuck out of the house earlier and was now trying to sneak back in undetected.

Obviously he's in a lot of trouble and we had a very serious talk. But more important for me are all the planning, preparedness and gun safety issues that come up for me having experienced this situation in reality.

What if it wasn't him but was a real home invader? Would I be dead right now? What if it's him again next time? All of a sudden my imagined ""home invasion"" scenarios have become a LOT more complicated and need to be considered more carefully. But I expect this experience will make me both more prepared and also safer.

Hopefully our kid will also re-consider when he thinks about sneaking out again. He was rather shaken by the whole thing, crying and apologizing profusely. But we sat for a long time talking about why he cant be sneaking in and out, and even though I didn't have the gun with me, how the way I've practiced gun safety &amp; engagement means I probably wouldn't have shot at him anyway. (it was dark, I didn't see a weapon, he wasn't attacking or moving towards me aggressively etc.)  i.e. I was scared but my life wasn't in danger.

Just looking for thoughts and input really, and to share a realization that I've come to.

Yesterday at about 3:30, I was sitting at my desk at work, sort of aimlessly looking out the window on a slow Saturday. I am carrying at the time, as I usually do, tucked under a polo shirt. I see a woman in a large pickup attempting to park, and she's getting it all wrong and backs right into my car, doing obvious damage. I walk outside, filming with my phone as she hasn't stopped driving yet. I explain to her that she damaged my property and she admits to doing so, we examine the damage on both vehicles, I get her plate number and ask for her insurance info and everything seems to be going well so I cut the video.

She's pleasant, while upset and I am trying to be nice about the whole situation. I call the police for a report and she realizes she doesn't have an insurance card. She calls her husband for the insurance information and that's when things start to get weird.

I'm not privy to the other end of the phone conversation, but it's clear that the husband is trying to coach her on denying what just happened. She starts claiming that the damage was already there on her truck, as well as on my car. I begin taking detailed photos of my paint chips on her car and the way the damage lines up. While still on the phone with him, she sees me doing this so then starts loudly claiming that I ""threatened and intimidated her"" and starts making a scene. She continues telling me that I'm threatening her and intimidating her and that I came outside swearing and yelling at her (all of which is on video that proves she's lying). Realizing that I am carrying and the sheriff is on the way I start to worry and head back inside. 

Once the sheriff arrives the woman makes the same claims but thankfully the sheriff didn't care. She (the sheriff) looks at the damage on both cars, notes that the dents are fresh, no rust, etc. Notes that I was nowhere near my car when this happened and therefore am not at fault, and makes up a nice police report. 

The TL:DR is this, basically I was involved in an encounter where the other party was doing everything she could to attempt to cover her ass, and decided to make up a story about how I was threatening and intimidating her. I can only imagine if she knew I was carrying or god forbid I was carrying openly it would not have gone well for me when the cops arrived on scene. More than anything I was kind of left with that thought in my mind and I don't know what to make of it.

Bottom line is, I've been carrying a long time, and I carry daily. I've drawn twice when I felt it was justified, but I've never felt more *uncomfortable* while carrying than I did yesterday.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_1fiqjq,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1fiqjq/had_a_very_weird_encounter_yesterday_while/,

I hope you guys will find this to be of interest anyway. 

I was sitting outside and talking with a friend on my cell when I heard some yelling sounds in the distance. I was a curious what was going on so I got up and started looking around. I noticed people standing outside of a doorway and looking in.

I walked in and saw a single cop wrestling with a black dude who was on the floor. The man was loudly shouting and complaining. As I slowly approached, I hung up on my call and dialed 911. I wasn't sure if the cop had been able to call for back up before the altercation. 

As the phone rang I noticed that the cop was really struggling to get the man under control. My original intention was only to be a good witness, but I quickly realized that this guy might actually be a threat to the officer. 

Once I had approached (cautiously) to within about ten feet of the men I asked the officer if he wanted my help. I can't remember exactly what he said but he beckoned me over. I can't remember the exact order of events, but I believe that when I first came over the officer had the man in a chock-hold. 

I did my best to help by holding the man down and trying to get his right hand behind his back as directed by the officer. I tried to talk the man down as well by telling him that I wanted to help him and asking him to calm down. That didn't seem to help. 

This man was strong. I mean really strong. I'm about 6ft 175lbs and I could barely keep just his right arm behind his back. One scary thing that I noticed was that the man grabbed at the cops duty belt with his right hand. I guess campus police officers don't carry guns, but he was reaching for the spot where his gun would have been. 

It took a while to get both the man's hands behind his back, he was resisting the whole way through. He was covered in so much sweat that I think he may have been on drugs. 

Once the handcuffs were on the man we kept holding him down until backup arrived. I asked the cop to let me know when he wanted me to back off, the last thing I wanted to do was get in his way. 

Once cops started arriving they asked me to step back. I gave them my contact info and briefly told them what had happened. 

I gained a lot of respect for what cops go through. Throughout the entire encounter the man yelled about police brutality and excessive force, while at the same time putting up a hell of a fight.

I suspect that the cop would have gotten by just fine without my help, but I was glad to offer my help in a small way. We shook hands afterwards and he thanked me. 

What really bothered me was the behavior of the onlookers. No one else intervened to help the cop, and it looked like no one was even calling the police. What really killed me is that all the witnesses who had been there when I arrived seemed to disappear. I guess I  chalk up the crowds behavior to the bystander effect. 

Well, that may have gone a little long. This certainly made my day interesting. I hope this story is relevant to this subreddit, despite my gun remaining safely in it's holster the whole time.

But anyway, the NE highway patrol officer comes to my window and I *immediately* declare that I have my PX4 .45 in my glove box and hand him my permit along with my DL. I hold a Utah non-resident CCP and he was kind of baffled and I informed him that the Utah permit is honored in Nebraska. I think he was all together confused since I had a Nebraska DL, Utah CCP, and Illinois license plates (I recently moved to NE). So he kindly asks me to exit my vehicle to come to his patrol car (I sat in the front seat) while he sorts out the hodgepodge of paperwork I gave him. As he is verifying my CCP, lack of criminal history, and vehicle tags... I noticed his M&amp;P 15 and we start talking about guns. This conversation goes on for about 15 minutes and was quite pleasant. He hands me a warning for not having switched to Nebraska license plates and never even mentioned the speeding. My take on the situation is that gun enthusiasts unite. It was my first time being pulled over with my CCW on me and having remembered that **the first thing to do is declare your weapon,** it was a pretty good experience... relatively speaking. Just thought I'd share my story.

Edit: The state of [Nebraska](http://www.handgunlaw.us/states/nebraska.pdf) requires that you declare your weapon to any peace officer or emergency personnel. It's not NY where unfortunately, your butthole may or may not be resized to the diameter of Johnny Law.

I live in Ohio and ran to the mall to get my girlfriend a gift. Nice area, wealthy crowd, WASPy suburbia. I'm Walking out (carrying concealed) with a jewelry bag in one hand in the middle of the day, so I'm not really alert. Not until this guy walks out from between two SUVs and asks if I have any cash on me. I know enough to say no. He gives me a line about his van being out of gas. Again, I say no, shift the bag to my non-trigger hand. He sort of stands in my path before turning and walking very slowly  away from me but in the direction I'm walking, so I hold back, act like I've got a phone call and stand there until he's far enough from my car that I feel comfortable to get in and leave. 

I don't know his intentions. He might've told the truth and just not been aware of how he came across. But I considered him a potential threat, treated him with suspicion and went on with my day. No harm done. I just can't help but stress to everyone how vital it is to be vigilant and alert, even in suburbia when your guard is down.

That said, I wasn't carrying with one chambered. The close proximity made me realize I couldn't have chambered, aimed and fired in that distance if things went wrong. I think I'll change that practice tomorrow.

Help?,Irlyh8usernames,99,21,229,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1gnxar/girlfriend_has_issues_with_my_plan_to_carry_help/,"Figured I'd submit here before /r/relationship_advice. So January I turned 21 and bought a handgun. February I took my CCW class. Fast forward to April, I sent out my paper work. Now, last night we were at the grocery store. She comes up to me and puts her arm around me and feels a bump in my waistband. ""She whispers, is that your gun?!"" I tell her no it's my cellphone, I'm trying to get used to having something in my waistband so when my permit comes I'm use to carrying (my logic?). At first she didn't think anything of it until we got back into my car. She said something about if I was serious about carrying one day, I told her yeah that's why I've spent so much time and money trying to get my permit. She asks me where my gun was now and I told her in the center console (perfectly legal in Florida). This is where she loses her shit. I'll summarize what her points were:

* I don't want you to hurt yourself.

* I don't want you to pull the gun out in anger. How do I know you won't shoot me when I piss you off?

* I don't want you to accidentally shoot someone if the gun were to go off.

* Why do you need to carry?

* I don't like the idea of you having a gun on you everyday all day.

My counter points were as follows (summarized)

* Accidents do not happen with firearms, only negligence. I have taken a 6 hour safety course before I filed for my permit and have watched countless videos on what is safe and what is not safe.

* She thinks I have anger issues. I don't, she just stresses me out over bullshit things which causes me to become short with her. I've humored her and will be talking with out pastor Monday for ""stress management"". What she doesn't realize is, I've carried the gun with me everyday since purchase in my car. I've had plenty of arguments. When I bought the gun, I asked myself, can I handle this responsibility? I find myself actually avoiding confrontation if I have it within a close proximity. Further more, I told her if she is truly worried about me shooting her, she doesn't need to be with me at all. I don't know where the hell she is getting this from. She is the one who always threatens me. One instance we were in the kitchen with her mother and her mom started talking about ""Oh what if irlyh8usernames ever cheated on you?"" (side note, she's 100% pureto rican) and my girlfriend goes ""Just like you told me mom, cut his dick off in the kitchen and make it look like an accident."" I don't know why I didn't run... My point here being, I've never even lifted a hand at her, but she has at me and she is afraid I'm the one who would hurt her?

* Again, accidents do not happen with firearms, only negligence. I have taken a 6 hour safety course before I filed for my permit and have watched countless videos on what is safe and what is not safe.

* I need to carry for the same reason you need a fire extinguisher in your house. I plan on carrying on me in public as well, when you walk into a restaurant, do you not hope they have a good fire extinguisher system whether it be an actual fire extinguisher or the sprinklers on the roof? If I am somewhere and a crazy starts shooting at me, I want to be able to send bullets back in their direction in order to stop my threat.

* I tried to compromise with her here and even stated I wouldn't carry on me if I were around her. I told her a big reason for wanting to be able to carry is my job.

Does anyone have a problem similar to mine? I've taken her shooting twice, she loved it. She is slowly becoming familiar with firearms. Originally she planned on taking the CCW course with me and getting her permit at the same time, but never followed through with it. I don't know why she is so surprised that I plan(ned) on carrying. I've made it very clear to her with the talk about holsters, my next gun purchase will be the gun I plan on carrying, etc.

1353077032.0,76,self.CCW,13asrb,"On ""brandishing"" and the draw-fire mindset. ",Predditor_drone,85,9,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/13asrb/on_brandishing_and_the_drawfire_mindset/,"There seems to be some confusion amongst some of the subscribers here on what brandishing is so I wanted to point out a few things. 

First, the definition of the word:
bran·dish 
Pronunciation: \ˈbran-dish\
Function: transitive verb 
Etymology: Middle English braundisshen, from Anglo-French brandiss-, stem of brandir, from brant, braund sword, of Germanic origin; akin to Old English brand Date: 14th century 
1 : to shake or wave (as a weapon) menacingly 
2 : to exhibit in an ostentatious or aggressive manner

This is the literal definition of the word brandish. Consult all applicable laws for the legal term and its implications. 


Generally, brandishing is considered as drawing a weapon in order to intimidate and victimize a subject. Drawing your weapon in response to a threat of lethal force is not brandishing. If the threat flees or subsides as a result of your weapon being drawn and presented in response to the threat, you are to act accordingly in the situation as it unfolds. The notion of ""if I have to draw my weapon, I am going to fire"" could turn around to bite you in the ass as you're engraving in your mind that the second your sights are on the threat, you pull the trigger. What if the threat is neutralized as I said, by running away or backing down? Welp, now you're pulling the trigger and putting a bullet in a fleeing or surrendering subject.  There are numerous cases like this to draw upon, both CC and home defense, where the shooter did just that, and got legally fucked in the ass and sentenced to prison. I'm not going to reference any, because the accounts of those are easy enough to find (google it, I'm feeling lazy at the moment). 

Where is this going? To the range. It's likely that many of you practice draw-to-fire drills, which is certainly fine to practice and implement in certain situations, but it should not be so engrained in your mindset and muscle memory that if you had to draw your weapon, sights would immediately go on target AND your finger would pull the trigger. That leaves no time whatsoever to asses the situation before you commit the irrevocable and life changing action of pulling the trigger on another human. Sometimes shit happens (isn't that why we carry?) and people cannot stop themselves from pulling the trigger. Don't let that be you. Change your mindset and alter your training drills a bit to give yourself a short moment to asses the situation when you're able to, and act with force rapidly only when you have no choice.

It's not just your life that could be affected by an improperly trained index finger and an undisciplined mindset so conduct yourself in a manner befitting someone with the power and responsibility of carrying a loaded firearm.

Was doing just under 60. Got pulled over by the cop shortly after and was slightly concerned as I had always planned on handing over my concealed carry permit along with my drivers license. Wasn't sure how the cop was going to react. When I handed him both cards, he simply asked:

Cop: ""Do you have your firearm now?"" 

Me: ""Yes, it's in my holster at the small of my back. How would you like me to proceed?""

Cop: ""Step outside for me and I'll take your firearm until we are done here, then you can have it back.""

Wrote me my ticket. Even reduced my recorded speed so that my ticket was reduced by over $100. Gave me my gun back and told me to re-holster and have a nice day. Wasn't excited about getting a ticket, but everything turned out better than expected.

If anyone else has had an experience with law enforcement while carrying, good or otherwise, please feel free to share. 

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses guys! To answer some of the questions being asked here:
-I'm in Florida.
-At the time, I hadn't even considered the 4th amendment as I'm a relatively new CCW holder. However I think as I have more experience I will definitely be more mindful of preserving my given rights and being aware of abuses of those rights.

1363213238.0,73,self.CCW,1a8uia,Medical Marijuana and CCW... Did I Unknowingly Give Up My 2A Rights?,General_Veers,95,22,145,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1a8uia/medical_marijuana_and_ccw_did_i_unknowingly_give/,"Hi, all. Long time lurker/commenter, I think first time poster here. Got kind of a serious situation that I didn't realize I had gotten myself into and I'm hoping for some input from this fine community.

Backstory: I applied for and received my CCW (called CPL where I live, Michigan) in 2008. I carried routinely until I moved to the area I live in now where it was much less necessary. Around this time, a bit more than a year ago, I applied for and received my medical marijuana card (called the Michigan Medical Marihuana Program or 'MMMP' card here). 

Once I received my card, which is necessary for both consuming *and* growing marijuana in the state of Michigan, I stopped carrying completely. To me, and I know many will disagree with me here, it's irresponsible to carry a Glock while also carrying a weed card. That's just me, so I stopped carrying firearms all together. My CPL expired in November, and I let it lapse because my MMMP card was still active.

Well, MMMP card expired March 1 of this year. I have no intention of renewing it. Since coming to that decision I figured it was a good time to get paperwork around to renew my CPL. I called a contact of mine, a Sheriff's Deputy in my county, and asked if I could use him for a reference since I have to have two references on my renewal application. He told me I had a problem.

He said he knew about my marijuana card and that I was no longer eligible for a CPL. He said it would be a violation of Federal law for them to approve it. This was news to me, and I'd read up on it a fair amount before ever getting my MMMP card. I know about the statement from the ATF, saying federal law prohibits someone who is an ""unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance"" to purchase or own a gun.

Well, my card is expired and, even if it wasn't, I am not trying to purchase a gun. I guess I'm not seeing the problem here. Am I screwed? Does my contact have it wrong? Is my county about to cross a line it's illegal/unconstitutional for them to cross? 

**TL;DR --** Got a CCW in 2008, got a weed card in 2012, CCW expired in Nov and weed card on March 1. Waited until after weed card expired to renew CCW, was told I can't. Have I lost my right to a CCW because I once had a weed card?

**EDIT --** Wow! I did not expect such a big response. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I will keep up with this, and update in subsequent days/weeks as I get through the process. Here's hoping all goes well. If not... Well you'll be along for the ride either way. Thanks again, everyone.

Learn From My Mistake. ,Dornicus,87,20,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/13hen2/soa_ccwers_secondworst_nightmare_just_happened_to/,"So I was carrying my CZ-75D outside my waistband, under an untucked button-down shirt. The holster was a generic, made-in-China leather holster that was essentially to flat strips of leather and a single clip (not sure if there's a name for this; if not, I recommend ""Huge Liability Holster""). 

Anyway, everything is as normal, everything feels fine, and my father and I walk into a grocery store to purchase some paper plates in anticipation of Thanksgiving (classy family). 

I make it three steps in the door, and my holster fucking drops off my waist, gun and all, and hits me in the foot. I look down, and prevent myself from saying anything at all because I don't want anyone to look. I slip the gun back in the holster, stuff the whole mess under my shirt, and walk past the cashiers out the door, muttering something like ""Dropped something, be right back."" 

I went outside, locked the gun in my glove box, locked my truck, then came back inside, shaking from adrenalin dump and embarrassment. 

Thankfully, I don't think the clerks saw, except maybe one who looked at me funny. I was, however, dressed professionally, and my undershirt had ""[MY CITY] FIRE DEPARTMENT"" on it, so it was probably clear I wasn't a shady dude. 

Anyway, my dad and I buy our things, make it all the way back to the truck, then he says, ""Let's talk about what you dropped in there."" My dad is extremely anti-gun, but he was surprisingly cool; he respected my decision, but he told me I should make a learning experience out of it. 

So that's what I'm doing here.

What did we learn? 

1) Cheap, shitty holsters are no good. If you're gonna spend a chunk of change to buy a gun to carry, spend some more to buy a good god damn holster. 

2) Looking professional probably prevented me from having the cops called. 

3) Don't panic.

My submission will be coming soon, but the highest caliber I've got to offer is .380.

EDIT: suggestions for ground rules would be appreciated. One I thought of - the place where your weapon is located has to be visible (e.g. no SOB carry with a front-facing photo)

Also changed to say largest gun, not highest caliber, as per B5_S4's suggestion.

Ground rules:

* Must submit a pic (not necessarily to /r/malefashionadvice) of the same outfit with the weapon exposed
* Carry position must be exposed in photo
* Don't stick a rifle down your pants and just stand there straight-legged. Let's be reasonable

A story about open carry
Last night, around 9:45, my wife and I were on the way home from grocery shopping.  We were in separate vehicles because she had just gotten out of class, and I was about 10 minutes behind her.  About five minutes out of town, on a very dark stretch of interstate, she saw a vehicle stopped on the side of the road with an older gentleman walking down the interstate towards the next town.  She passed too quickly, but called me and asked me to stop and offer help.


I, being a realist, decided that if I was going to stop, I would be carrying.  I haven’t received my CCW license yet, but Louisiana is an Open Carry state, so I knew I was well within my rights to be armed.  I stopped about fifteen yards behind them, got out of my vehicle and approached the older gentleman.  


I greeted him and asked if there was anything that I could do to help.  He said they (he was travelling with his wife) had overheated and were trying to make it to the next exit.  They had been on the road for just over five hours.  I told him that I would do whatever I could do to help them and proceeded to walk back to their van with him.


I decided that he was not a threat to my safety, so I very casually informed him that I was carrying and that he should inform his wife so she didn’t freak out.  We ended up sitting on the side of the road for the next ten minutes.  A point in the conversation that stands out is his wife and I having this conversation:

**Her**: “So what do you do that you carry that?” She points to my gun

**Me**: “I’m actually a student.  I didn’t know who y’all were and didn’t want to get in a bad situation”

**Her**: “Oh no, I’m not worried about it.  I’m actually glad you have it.  Good to know you’re on our side.”

After limping along, we finally get them to the next exit, which happens to be a very dangerous part of a dangerous town.  They were very appreciative of both me stopping and of me carrying.  We ended up calling the local sheriff’s office to get an escort back to town, and he was also very supportive of both me stopping and of me carrying.  Apparently there have been a few robberies of people stopped on the side of the road and the sheriff was glad to have someone with them.


**tl;dr**


Not everyone is against open carry.  Both the couple that I stopped to help tonight and the sheriff that responded to our call were very supportive of it, in fact.

1352671179.0,68,self.CCW,13119k,Is brandishing ever appropriate?,non_troppo,80,12,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/13119k/is_brandishing_ever_appropriate/,"I've heard conflicting opinions from various friends, instructors, and enthusiasts on this, and there doesn't seem to be one camp that the majority of gun owners fit into.

The question is - is it ever appropriate to brandish your gun without firing it? Some people are of the mindset that firing your gun should be your absolute last line of defense, and anything you can do to ward off attackers short of firing your weapon - the sound of chambering a round, the appearance of a laser sight, or merely making your attacker aware that you are armed and capable of using deadly force - should be pursued before you consider putting your finger on the trigger. A lot of people probably get this idea from ~~Jeff Cooper, who suggests in Principles of Self Defense~~ a popular forum post entitled 'Street Robberies and You,' which suggests that pulling your jacket back to reveal your handgun or some similar show of force is an effective means of deterring a would-be attacker in a dark parking lot.

The other end of the spectrum says that drawing your gun must always be associated with firing your gun. Draw, aim, 2-3 shots to halt your attacker, holster.

Obviously both have their pros and cons. If you choose to brandish your weapon without firing it, you will possibly halt an attack without ending a life, which I think most of us would agree is the best case scenario for any encounter. On the other hand, if you disassociate drawing your weapon with firing it and draw your weapon on someone who wouldn't have otherwise warranted a show of force, you could face criminal charges for wrongfully brandishing a deadly weapon. There are also some that say that any show of force short of firing your weapon only serves to alert your attacker that you are armed, and gives them motivation to fire on you when they otherwise may not have had chance or reason to do so.

What does everyone think?

For the sake of conversation let's assume the following scenario. You're walking to your car late at night, the parking lot is near pitch black. As you approach your car you see someone attempting to break in through the driver's side door. They notice you, turn to face you, and begin to approach you. They are not armed as far as you can tell, but they are much bigger than you and could obviously wreck your day if they wanted to. If you do nothing, they could soon draw close enough to you with malice that firing on them is no longer a feasible option. If you brandish but do not fire, you could provoke a deadly attack from someone who may not have otherwise attacked you, or you could draw on an innocent person who will then call the police and have you arrested for wrongfully brandishing a deadly weapon. If you draw and fire, you are attacking an unarmed (as far as you can tell) person who may have simply mistaken your car for theirs in the dark.

**edit:** somehow got 'Street Robberies and You' mixed up with 'Principles of Self Defense'

**edit 2:** By brandish I just mean drawing your weapon without immediately firing it - giving the aggressor a chance to stop his actions before you pull the trigger. Apparently the definition of brandishing implies showing a weapon menacingly/aggressively.

This meant that today was my first day carrying.

I have to say that it was very very weird and nerve wracking at first. I couldn't stop thinking about someone noticing and causing a scene. However the more I was out and about, and the more the gun started to feel normal on my hip the more this went away. (Though it always feels present which I like. I don't ever want to forget it's there) I ran a few errands, helped move a refrigerator, went out to dinner, and got gas without any issues. I know this doesn't seem like much but it feels like a big step to me at this point. 

I was also happy that when after all this I asked my wife how I'd done about not having my hand on my weapon or any other nervous ticks she told me that I had done fine.  She said the only time I ever put my hand anywhere near my gun was to shift it slightly when I got up from sitting down.

1363105709.0,65,self.CCW,1a5jwb,Here to vent.  Today I got to experience failed bureaucracy at it's finest.,runanteloperun,74,9,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1a5jwb/here_to_vent_today_i_got_to_experience_failed/,"So I am trying to apply for a non-resident permit for concealed carry in New Hampshire.

I have no criminal record, no arrests, I don't do drugs etc.  Not a perfect person, but I like to think I'm up there.  I'm also the most modest.

So I go to the State Police of New Hampshire's website, and download the pdf, and begin to gather my paperwork.  

As a Vermont resident, we have constitutional carry.  Vermont requires no permit to carry open or concealed.  As such, we have no permit that I can copy and send in as proof of my worthiness.  

[The New Hampshire form states] (http://www.nh.gov/safety/divisions/nhsp/ssb/permitslicensing/documents/dssp260.pdf) , 

""**Or if you are a Vermont resident,** 2) A letter from your local police department, verifying that the state you reside in does not require a licence to carry concealed, and that, to the best of the department's knowledge, 

-You have never been denied a license to carry.

-You have never been convicted of a felony which has not been Annulled

-You are not a user of controlled drugs or narcotics without orders from a physician

-You have not been treated for mental illness, emotional problems, or confined to a mental health facility

-You have no domestic violence petitions that would prevent possession of weapons under federal statute, and

-In any court of a misdemeanor of domestic violence.

OK, I think to myself,  that shouldn't be too hard.

So I go to my local police department, and they make me call the records dept. from their lobby phone, who then pushes me around to 5 other people who all ""have never heard of anything like that before"".

Finally, I get in touch with somebody who tells me, we can't write that letter for you, because we can't perform a background check on you unless you are under arrest.  
After an hour of being pushed around, I get a non-answer.
Ok, so what do I do now?

I go to the local State Trooper station, and meet with a very nice trooper who after explaining my situation, is kind enough to write me a letter specifying that Vermont does not require any sort of permitting for open or concealed carry.  He will not comment on the other portions of the requirements, however, since he can't run my name without me being arrested. I thank him profusely for his help, and leave after about a 1/2 hour.

So I call the NH State police licencing department, and explain my conundrum to them.  I ask them if I go to the State Public Safety office, and do a background check on myself, if that would suffice, with the letter from the State trooper.

They tell me that a background check is unnecessary, since they will be doing a NICS check on me anyways when my application is processed.  What they really want is just a letter from my local PD that says that I'm a good person, and that they don't have issues with me.

OK.  Deep breaths.

Day 2.

I wake up this morning, and drive 40 minutes to Waterbury, VT and pay 30$ for a background check, and get a notarized copy on official letterhead stating that I have no criminal record in the State of Vermont..  Sweet.

I then call my local PD, and ask them if they would be willing to write me a letter based on the local database, and the guy says that he'll help me out, just swing by the station.

I drive 40 mins. back to town.

I get to the PD station, and call on the lobby phone and get in touch with the same guy who asks my name and date of birth, and says he'll have it in about 5-10 minutes.  I can smell victory.

20 minutes later, a different guy comes out and tells me that the PD has a policy against writing ""good conduct"" letters for individuals, and that they would tell the same to anybody else trying to get one for Med school, or to take the BAR exams.  It's just ""something they don't do.""

RAGE.

So what do I do now?

I contact the Sheriff (had already called 3 times with no answer).  And leave a message.  Then I decide to drive to his office and talk to him in person.  To his credit, he takes about 10 minutes to talk to me, and explains that he won't write me a letter, because..

1. He doesn't know whether the notarized background check is authentic.

2. He doesn't know that I don't use drugs, or haven't been in trouble with the law.

among other reasons.  He even made it a point to mention that he doesn't sign NFA ATF forms, because he doesn't know whether people are on drugs or not.

OK.  Thank him for his time.  He just lost a vote.

Finally decide to just send in the information as-is, and hope for the best.

I have seen the belly of the beast, and just how broken our entire governmental systems really are.  It's not just Federal, the whole thing is fu*ked all the way down to the local levels.

What is funny about all of this is, EVERY single person I interacted with during this whole charade acknowledged that an actual criminal WOULD NOT go through any of this hassle to get a permit.  That only law abiding people would, and that a criminal would just take the chance, and cross the border with their weapon concealed.

Just had to vent.  If you have any advise please post below.

I'm feeling awfully dejected today.

**edit to add: I haven't been declined, I'm hoping the NCIC check I did will cover the other caveats.  Since it is greater proof that I am not a criminal than is required.  I sent in the information I had, and hopefully it gets approved.  The lady in NH said that if I got rejected, I would know quickly through ""express mail"" and it would be because I failed the background check.  I'm hoping that was a hint hint, nudge nudge type answer.  But, we'll see.**

* We went through the information, lots of ""story"" telling by him, like about how he accidentally discharged his handgun from his 2nd story apartment through the floor into his neighbor downstairs living room.  I guess he was using that as a ""teaching experience"".  
* He also injected plenty of his own political thoughts into the ""class"", ranging from him not caring if he ""offends Arabs"", or mentioning the ""liberals"" anytime gun control was mentioned by a student.  

All in all it was a waste of 8 hours to me, I barely learned anything I didn't know, the range qualification was laughable.

I just received it back from Springfield's repair (AMAZING customer service, by the way), and it looks like a completely different lever on the inside. there's definitely some breathing room now between the bullet and the lever, although I haven't yet tested it out. If you have one, take a good look at how it sits with rounds in the magazine, and look at the gap between the two. Also check the bottom of the lever through the magazine well and check to see if you can see any brass coating it.

We decided to tow our motorcycles with us (I-80 through Nevada will eat up a sport motorcycle tire in no time).  In less than a week I had two instances where I wish I was able to carry my pistol.

**The Swagger**
If any of you live or have spent time in a bad part of town then you are probably familiar with the walk I have dubbed The Ghetto Swagger.  This unusual gait is typified by dramatically swinging or dipping shoulders, often has smaller steps and the person appears to tip their pelvis back and forth to lift their feet.  In the time I lived in a very bad neighborhood, I learned to spot The Ghetto Swagger; it usually means shit is about to go down. 

My wife and I had stopped for fuel near a CostCo in Seaside, CA along the central coast (the CostCo didn't have any pumps).  Right now you are probably thinking of picturesque coast line, expensive houses tucked among the redwoods and pines, and probably a faux-historic downtown district with overpriced boutiques.  Reality was somewhat different: a grubby gas station, restrooms covered in Aryan Brotherhood and other gang tags, and one out-of-state white boy in an SUV towing two flashy motorcycles and looking very, very out of place; needless to say, I wanted to get my fuel and get the hell out of there.  

I was standing next to the pump as I was fueling up and making sure to check my surroundings every few seconds without looking too conspicuous; as I did I noticed a guy with a big puffy knee-length coat strutting right towards me with The Ghetto Swagger.  He was staring intently at me and it was clear that he was moving with a purpose.  While keeping an eye on him, I moved from the pump up to my open driver's window to retrieve my [SOG axe](http://imgur.com/8lI6oPm) from the driver's door pouch.  I snapped the cover off and kept it at the ready but out of sight.  Swagger Guy saw me reach for it, and not knowing what I had in my hand, thought better of approaching me.  He turned and exited the gas station property and I watched him until he reached the corner of the block.

**Oakland**

We were at a friend's condo in Oakland and left around 11:30 at night.  We were on our motorcycles and one in our party had to get fuel right away so we stopped at the closest gas station.  In the time it takes to pump 5-6 gallons of fuel we had one guy get uncomfortably close asking for money and another guy who was probably tripping come within inches of me and my bike while rambling about the motorcycles being ""time machines"".  The group that worried me the most was the half-dozen or so young males that appeared from behind the gas station's small payment shack to stand several yards behind us while my friend fueled up.  They continued to inch closer and closer and appeared to be trying to goad each other into doing something.  I signaled my wife to keep her bike running and to run like hell if anything happened (we are used to communicating with hand signals).  My friend finally finished fueling after what seemed like ages and we got the hell out of there.

I have never wanted my daily carry more than in those two situations.  I guarantee that, had I been armed, my hand would have been on my weapon and ready to draw.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_1jtsge,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1jtsge/a_recent_trip_to_california_and_two_situations/,

When I usually go to this Dr. which I have gone to for years, I get my meds and i'm in and out. They take my weight, blood pressure and i'm good to go.

So the Dr. puts his stethoscope in his ears and asks me to lift up my shirt.

I'm carrying a G19 at 3 o' clock in a crossbreed supertuck and a spare magazine at 9 o'clock.

The Dr. and the nurse are standing strong side to my gun. While I lift up my shirt I tell them that I'm a concealed weapons permit holder, and he proceeds to do have me breath in and out etc. while he checks my heart/lungs.

Neither of them said a word, the nurse clearly glanced at my gun but they made no mention of anything at all. They went on about their business and said nothing.

Got a refill on my script and went on about my day!

It was a little anxious revealing my gun to a Dr. whom i've never met before, didn't want to scare him.

Shooting Advice:

Cops carry guns to protect themselves, not to protect you.

Never let someone or thing that threatens you get inside arm's length and never say ""I've got a gun"". If you feel you need to use deadly force for heavens sake let the first sound they hear be the safety clicking off, and they shouldn't have time to hear anything after that if you are doing your job.

The average response time of a 911 call is over 23 minutes, the response time of a .44 magnum is 1400 feet per second.'

""The most important rules in a gunfight are: Always win - and cheat if necessary.""

""Don't forget, incoming fire has the right of way.""

""Make your attacker advance through a wall of bullets. You may get killed with your own gun, but he'll have to beat you to death with it, cause it's going to be empty.""

""If you're not shooting, you should be loading. If you're not loading, you should be moving, if you're not moving, someone's going to cut your head off and put it on a stick.""

When you reload in low light encounters, don't put your flashlight in your back pocket. If you light yourself up, you'll look like an angel or the tooth fairy...and you're going to *be* one of them pretty soon.""

""Do something. It may be wrong, but do something.""

""Shoot what's available, as long as it's available, until something else becomes available.""

""If you carry a gun, people will call you paranoid. That's ridiculous.
If you have a gun, what the hell do you have to be paranoid for?""

""Don't shoot fast, unless you also shoot good.""

""You can say 'stop' or 'alto' or use any other word you think will work, but I've found that a large bore muzzle pointed at someone's head is pretty much the universal language.""

""You have the rest of your life to solve your problems. How long you live depends on how well you do it.""

""You cannot save the planet, but you may be able to save yourself and your family.""

If you must shoot, make sure your side of the story is the only one available.

When I decided to get mine, I talked about it with a few friends and for the most part, I was surprised that most people, my girlfriend included, just couldn't understand why I would want to carry. 

Yesterday is a perfect example why. 

I went for a walk with my dog along a trail that is very close to my house. There are nature trails, places to swim, bike, etc. so it's pretty popular. I wasn't five minutes into the walk when a young guy and girl came up asking me if I had seen any loose dogs. After a short conversation with them, I wanted to say that, here, alone on a trail with my dog, with your two, fully grown approximately 80 pound pit bulls loose without a collar or tags are exactly the reason why I don't feel safe walking around and particularly with my dog. 

Nothing happened and I never saw the dogs but when I got home, for the first time my girlfriend said, ""I get it. I'm glad you were carrying.""

This isn't meant to be a negative post about Pit Bulls...it was more the owners fault and clearly any dogs that he (approximately 18 to 22 y/o) owned were not likely to be well behaved. That's the point though. Some people think I carry because I think I'm going to be in a shoot out at the OK Corral but the truth is, I carry just because you never know when you're going to wish you were.

What they don't understand is that the only thing that makes a gun dangerous is the person that's holding or mistreating it.""

By giving her that simple answer, I had that real eye-opening moment that really made me think how ignorant (not stupid; you can fix being ignorant) the general public can be when it comes to firearms.  The media hypes up shootings like it's goddamn Armageddon.  All semiautomatic rifles are ""assault rifles"" and all semiautomatic pistols are ""automatic handguns with large-capacity magazines.""  To quote a post I made in a forum's gun section (regarding the way media portrays violent criminals with firearms):

&gt; OH MAN! So the bad guy had a high-capacity drum clip ammo magazine with laser sights and silencers with barrel shrouds and scopes on his assault rifle with semi-auto automatic capabilities and the safety clicked off.

&gt;God damn. That sounds so scary, it makes me want to cry when I see guns.

After the whole discussion I had with my girlfriend about why people think ""guns are scary,"" I also went on to explain that I don't want a potential criminal seeing that I'm armed.  If he's going to jump me, it's most likely going to be in the parking lot or parking deck, so he's probably going to hang around out there for a while to find a victim.  I don't want him to see me arm myself... that gives him a major advantage.

Then again, from an outside perspective, seeing a guy strap on a 1911 .45 ACP and prepare to walk into a major shopping mall (as was the situation when she was asking me that question) may not be the best of scenarios.

Yes.  I EDC a full-sized 1911 .45 ACP.  I'm looking into a Glock 36 for my new carry weapon and keeping the 1911 at home.

More clarification:  I generally keep my pistol in my door pocket in my car because the handle started chewing up the seats.  It's still readily available, easier to access with my seat belt on, and is completely out of view from someone approaching my door.  When I prepare to go inside, I'll toss the holster on my hip, holster the gun, and go from there.  Of course, I do this with the doors closed and ensure nobody's around to see it.

Thank you for reading, assuming you did.  I just had to vent a bit after obsessing over general public ignorance and media portrayal of firearms.

I was at the store yesterday buying a gallon of milk because we were out  at home and you just can't make scrambled eggs fluff up without it.  While I was in the dairy section trying to decide between 1% and 2% (I chose 2%) a man came up next to me.  I looked over at him and saw he was wearing a t-shirt that had writing on it.  Well, I read EVERYTHING I see.  It had a picture of a 1911 on it and around the picture in big easy to read letters it said "".45 ACP... because shooting twice is just stupid"".  He saw me reading it, gave me a grin, said ""yea, no ones gunna fuck with this"", pulled up his shirt to reveal an openly carried 1911.  I said ""nice gun"", grabbed my milk, and proceed to leave.  Now, here are the morals of the story that I realized when thinking about it today.

1.  Wear clothes that are appropriate in the situation.  This includes tucking in the part of your shirt over your gun so that when you open carry it's actually visible.

2.  Your clothing says a lot to potential threats.  Wearing a shirt that essentially screams ""I HAVE A GUN, LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME!"" is probably not the worst idea at a gun show but anywhere else might not be a great idea.  What do you think a potential robber or shooter will think when he see's that shirt?  Probably something along the lines of ""I should shoot that guy first, he has a gun.""

3.  Open carry eliminates basically any tactical advantage you have in a force escalation situation.  You will become the primary target of the attacker.

That is my small rant.  Just thought I'd share these ideas.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_1izv9b,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1izv9b/something_that_happened_at_the_store_yesterday/,

1369763726.0,55,self.CCW,1f7mzz,Pucker moment when walking the dog. Would love to get your thoughts on what happened. For the first time I was consciously prepared to use my CCW.,NebraskaGunOwner,71,16,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1f7mzz/pucker_moment_when_walking_the_dog_would_love_to/,"Yesterday, I was walking my dog (Baxter) to the park like I've done a thousand times. He's a smaller guy, a white terrier-mix, who I got from a rescue. We were taking our normal route through the neighborhood on a sidewalk when we both stopped. Up ahead was a huge black and brown dog running around from yard to yard. I couldn't identify it from the distance I was at, but I soon saw that it was a [very muscular Rottweiler](http://outfitnm.com/wp-content/uploads/Rottweiler-Big-Dog-Picture.jpg).

I have nothing against certain breeds, and have owned a few big dogs through my years. Any dog can be brutally vicious or incredibly kind - depending on their owner and how they were raised.

Baxter, has always been skittish around bigger dogs. He was attacked by a German Sheppard before I got him. Because of this, he tends to have his guard up around them. Maybe it's a compensation thing, to act more aggressively as not to seem weak.

So were both standing their stopped on the sidewalk and can see that the Rottweiler is making his way toward our direction. I turned us around and started heading back the way we came. It didn't take long, maybe 10 or 20 seconds for the Rottweiler to really take notice of us and charge our way full tilt.

I remember thinking I could run up to a nearby house or hop in a pickup with an open bed in a driveway. But there was almost no time. The Rottweiler was on us in seconds.

At this point, I pulled Baxter in close and stood slightly in front of him. I turned toward the Rottweiler - he was breathing really heavy. I can only liken it to a bull about to charge, but I don't know if that means the same thing in a dog.

He was doing a kind of ""testing the water"" thing. Moving toward us then backing away quickly. I was pretty freaked out at this point. For the first time since carrying (which hasn't been that long compared to some) I made a conscious decision that I would be prepared to use my CCW depending on how the next few moments went down. I think we have all come to some level of mental preparation and acceptance that we might have to defend ourselves or loved ones one day - and as CCW holders we must be responsible for our actions. But this was different, it was like I went through a mental checklist in the moment and came to a conclusion that I've never been at before. 

Because this wasn't a mugger with a knife or gun. I was in this kind of limbo stage of unsureness and I didn't like it.

Now, I know some of you may be thinking that a dog really isn't a threat warranting the use of a CCW. Or if Baxter was attacked, would he qualify as a ""loved one"" that is legally defendable with a firearm? I certainly think so - and I firmly believe my wife would kill me if I didn't. I also know that I would physically intervine with my body if need be, putting myself in danger.

Baxter wasn't backing down and was pulling at the leash and barking. I'm certain he would have defended me to his death. The Rottweiler was getting amped up and started growling with his head haunched low. I was shouting ""Hey! Go! Get Away!"".  He was inching closer to us - not backing away. I pulled my jacket back and had my hand on my CCW. I literally thought at any second he would leap at us and I would need to defend us.

""SAM! GET BACK HERE!"". A woman had come into my vision from behind the Rottweiler and pulls on a collar that I didn't see seconds before. ""I'm so sorry! I know he looks dangerous but he is really nice!"".

And just like that, the moment of terror was over.

I pulled my jacket forward and was at a loss for words. I could tell she was embarrassed and was trying to get out of there. I remember mumbling something like ""No worries"". When really I was thinking ""Lady I almost shot your fucking dog! Don't let a dog like that out of your sight!""

So yea, awesome action-packed story, huh? But in the immediate aftermath, I *felt* different. I'm sure it was a mixture of adrenaline and/or fear - but for me it was as real as staring down a man with a knife.

I thought about this situation for a bit and wish I did two things differently. I had my phone on me and should have started recording the moment the Rottweiler was heading our direction. I could drop the phone if need be, but I needed an independent witness if I needed to defend myself.

I also should have walked up to a house immediately and knocked on a door. I remember having a feeling of embarrassment of being afraid of a dog. That pride needed to be literally checked at the door.

Thanks for reading, I am curious as to some of your thoughts. Would I have been justified or not? At what point?

All the information was great, the instructor was an RLEO from Raleigh, where we live.  When he began to talk about the places you cannot carry (courtrooms, schools, while intoxicated etc.) I was shocked to find that restaurants that serve alcohol are on that list.  EVERY Non-fast food restaurant in the area serves alcohol, effectively banning CCW while eating out at all.   After some research I discovered HB 17 (a rehash of the HB111 from 2012) that would allow ""restaurant carry"" you people know what to do, light up those phones and email accounts.  

TL:DR
North Carolina has once again opened the floor to a bill that will stop banning ccw in restaurants.  If you live in NC please contact your state reps about HB 17.  This bill will also give more privacy to the ccw permit holder database so criminals cannot easily access our personal information

The fight is here and it's up to EVERY gun owner to stop this madness before we have our rights taken away. 

----------------------

Here is the exact letter I am sending to my reps, feel free to copypasta. 

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I live in (MY AREA) and am writing you to encourage you to OPPOSE any gun legislation that would further erode our second amendment rights. Diane Feinstein is going to propose a reinstated Assault Weapons Ban that will destroy thousands of American jobs in the firearms sector, waste Government resources attempting to institute a National Firearm Registry, and bloat governments reach further into law abiding citizens lives.
&gt;
&gt;Gun control has been proven in cities like Chicago to be ineffective and will only cause harm to legal gun owners. I would like to link you to this article that polled random people in America, including non gun owners, and determined that over %51 polled DID NOT support an Assault Weapons Ban.
&gt;
&gt;http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/poll-51-percent-dont-want-gun-ban-85512.html?ml=la
&gt;
&gt;I would also like to remind you that in the wake of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, voters turned out in record numbers to vote out the Democratic majority that passed the law under President Clinton. I ask you to remember the voice of your constituents and see reason - an Assault Weapons Ban is NOT going to help our country and several studies have shown that the previous ban had ZERO affect on crime.
&gt;
&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban#Expiration_and_effect_on_crime
&gt;
&gt;""In 2004, a research report submitted to the United States Department of Justice and the National Institute of Justice found that should the ban be renewed, its effects on gun violence would likely be small, and perhaps too small for reliable measurement, because rifles in general, including rifles referred to as ""assault rifles"" or ""assault weapons"", are rarely used in gun crimes.""
&gt;
&gt;In conclusion, Feinstein's ban will destroy private sector American jobs, disenfranchise the voting public and lead to a further distrust in our Governments ability to effectively run our nation. A vote for this Assault Weapons Ban will result in me personally rallying support for your opponent in any further election and devoting ALL of my time and resources towards a more constitutionally friendly candidate.

This isn't one of those stories and I'm all about giving praise for a job well done. 

First a bit of background: I live in Michigan. I have a CPL permit in Michigan. I was driving to South Carolina for a funeral.

The Story:

I was on the last leg of my trip going EB on I-26 around 3A.M. I have a G30SF holstered in the drivers door pocket. After 12 hours in the car my mind starts to wander and to be honest Im preoccupied with my sisters death. I inadvertently creep past the speed limit and I pass a cop under an overpass. I see his headlights come on and I knew it was game over. It takes about a mile for him to flip on his take down lights and I promptly pull over. Of course there is a million thoughts going through my head. ""Shit, I have a gun."" ""This is my friends car."" ""Am I ever gona see my gun again?"" ""I hope this isn't gonna be bad like you see online."" I turn the car off, turn on the interior lights, open all the windows and put both hands at 12o'clock on the wheel. The officer come up to the passenger side door and introduces himself very politely. No attitude, no rhetorical questions, just professional and polite. 

LEO: Hi, Im officer Diaz with (I didn't catch the agency). Hows your night?

Me: Hi, Its ok. 

LEO:I'm pulling you over because I clocked you at 79 in a 70. Where are you heading?

Me: Columbia sir. 

LEO: (shining his flashlight around the car)Ok, well....

Me: (interrupting him) Sir before we go any further I have a CPL in my home state and there is a weapon in the car. 

LEO: Where?

Me: (moving my left leg) In the door pocket sir.

LEO: Ok, thank you for your honesty. Give me one second. (walks over to the drivers door.) Im gona take your firearm for a second for safety. Its nothing personal.

Me: Hey as a Law Enforcement student I totally understand. Ill allow you to open the door and take the gun. Its holstered, loaded, and one in the chamber. Ill keep my hand right here on the wheel. 

LEO: (Opens door, takes gun out of door pocket while never pointing the muzzle at me and puts it under his arm.) Ill need your permit as well. 

At this time we have a brief chit chat about where Im going, where I'm from, my schooling, ect. (I know Reddit never talk to cops, yeah yeah yeah.) He then goes back to the cruiser and does his thing. He comes back and asks me to open the trunk. I do so and he come back to the drivers door. 

LEO: Alright sir. I put your gun in the trunk. The mag is out and the slide is locked back. I hope you don't take offense to me putting it back there. 

Me: Absolutely not! 

At this time he tells me to slow it down, thanks me again for my cooperation, wishes me luck in school and a better week. We then go our separate ways. He was never overbearing, had a superiority complex, or anything of the sort. 

So Officer Diaz who patrolled the last few miles of I-26 before the NC/SC line, Thank you! Your exactly the cop I want to be. Professional, respectful, and no superiority complex. I just wish I knew what agency you worked for so I can write a letter.

EDIT: Alright fellow Redditors I can see where this is going. Everyone want to get all up in arms about rights and thats great (no it really is). However please understand that he asked and I could have easily said no. But I didnt and thats MY choice. I dont want this to turn into a cop-bashing-circle-jerk.

Thank you for contacting me regarding the rights of gun owners.
As you may know, I am a strong defender of our Second Amendment rights. The right of law-abiding citizens to own firearms is an individual right guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the Constitution and broadly interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. Our Founders clearly understood that one of the most basic rights of Americans is the ability to defend themselves and their families. 

In light of the terrible tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, there have been calls for immediate action to address gun control. I do believe it is important that we have a serious national discussion about preventing these senseless acts of violence and protecting our children in their schools. Equally important, however, is an effort that more broadly addresses ways to spend federal dollars more wisely when it comes to treating and identifying those who are mentally ill as well as intervening before they tragically impact their own lives and the lives of others. 

There are no easy answers here. I continue to believe that a weapons ban does not fix the issue. Whatever we do, it must be consistent with the Constitution.

I appreciate your thoughts and will continue to support legislation that safeguards our Second Amendment rights, encourages safe and responsible gun ownership, and keeps our homes and families safe.

Again, thank you for contacting me. I look forward to continuing our conversation on Facebook (www.facebook.com/SenatorBlunt) and Twitter (www.twitter.com/RoyBlunt) about the important issues facing Missouri and the country. I also encourage you to visit my website (blunt.senate.gov) to learn more about where I stand on the issues and sign-up for my e-newsletter.

--- Begin Original Message ---

Mr Bral,
 
I am a current student at Portland Community College, Sylvania campus. I am writing today to hopefully get a definitive answer on my right, as well as other students' rights, to conceal or open carry on PCC campus, faculty buildings, and student learning buildings. As per the PCC Student Rights document available online at pcc.edu, section 12, subsection 19:
 
""The use, carrying, exhibiting, or displaying of any weapon (as defined by Oregon Revised Statute 161.015), or facsimiles thereof, is prohibited on or in College facilities, except as provided by Oregon law or when approved by College administration for official College activities.""
 
From the above text, it appears to me that that, as per Oregon law, students are not allowed to bring firearms on campus or in college facilities except provided by Oregon law, which would obviously include a trained and permit holding student or individual to legally conceal or open carry on campus. I am writing today, as previously stated, to clarify current internal college policy.
 
Your response to this matter is appreciated in advance, I look forward to hearing from you in any way you see fit, as I have included all pertinent contact information below.

&lt;Name Removed&gt;, thank you for your questions!  While we do not encourage this, only current CHL holders may carry concealed on campus.  Open carry is only permitted by on-duty law enforcement personnel, displaying a badge/credentials.  For CHL holders on campus, the weapon must remain concealed at all times and be in secure possession of the CHL holder  e.g. not secured in a locker.  Let me know if you have further questions.

So there you go, as a concealed carry permit holder, you are fully endorsed by the security staff to conceal carry on campus. For me, this is fantastic news, and I replied back to Alan with a sincere thank you for his time. I have printed his email off and will be carrying it within my messenger bag I use for school, just in case faculty has questions or concerns.

If you'd like to write Alan Bral with additional questions, concerns, or simply a ""thank you"", you can find him via the MyPCC portal under the staff directory.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_rv4cj,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/rv4cj/pcc_portland_community_college_students_confirmed/,

1358802257.0,48,self.CCW,170egb,I've started open carrying again to promote a positive gun image to the public despite having my CCW permit.,what-the-frack,61,13,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/170egb/ive_started_open_carrying_again_to_promote_a/,"In light of all the stupidity against guns in the media I've started open carrying whenever possible to create positive personal gun experiences for non-gun people.  I usually continue to conceal carry a smaller gun in case I need disarm the visible sidearm to go somewhere and still be concealed, but I've been carrying my full frame pistols whenever I'm out and not at work (I work at schools so I can't do it there).

My pro-gun friends have even asked me why I'm carrying my full frame ""sidearm"" and after I explained it to them that I'm doing it for publicity for the 2A issues in the media right now they've all said they thought it was a good idea. 

Here's the full explanation of the reasons why I've started.  I'm considered a good role model and a leader in my community.  I do a lot of work with kids, and I've been recognized by the community for doing good work with all kids, but I do a lot with at-risk, disadvantaged, etc. students as well.   I'm also a known Democrat and know to identify as liberal on most social issues (not that that makes me pro or anti-gun, but I'm just giving all this info for background purposes).  Some of the people I've carried around have been people I've worked on some of these social issues with as well that aren't always gun friendly.  I believe that seeing someone like me supporting gun rights and exercising my 2A rights should let people that are unsure about how they feel about guns know that there are good people that carry every day, and there are ""good""  people who carry guns all throughout their community.  They just usually don't see them because they're concealed.  

I decided to start doing this because of a discussion a friend and I had while out to dinner with some of my friends that are very pro-2A, and the conversation turned to a discussion that a lot of people that are afraid of guns and assume that if you have one on you you're intending to shoot someone would be shocked to know how many people take weapons into public concealed every day.  It was our assumption that if they knew this they'd be less afraid of guns.  

I would like to encourage as many people as can to do this.  Like I said, I can only do this on my days off and after work.  A few things to note.  I don't do anything illegal: no drugs of any sort - ever (I'm actually for legalization of many drugs, but I've chosen to never imbibe), social drinking only - I've never driven under the influence, nothing in my house could be used to convict me of a crime (no you still can't search any of my property without a warrant (: ).  If you can't say similar types of things, according to your own belief system, I would advise not making yourself a poster child for the cause in your community.

I've been very surprised by the number of discussions my open carrying has inspired.  I've not had anyone react negatively, despite living in a very liberal community.  Friends, family and strangers have all had conversations with me about it and have all mostly been at least marginally supportive.  The interesting thing I've noticed is that the ""old timers"" are willing to compromise with mag size limits in the fight we're in right now.  I've been glad that I've been able to educate them on how government likes to chip away rights of citizens.  They've also been surprised to find out that my 9mm pistol (when I'm carrying it) has a mag size of 15.  Most of these guys are used to revolvers with 5-8 rounds or single stacks with 7-9 round maximums.

Educating people with common sense and a rational level headed bit of information tends to go a long way.  I'm just as fired up about this issue, but yelling at people who are unsure or who disagree with you does no good in turning them to our side.

What do you all think, does this sound like something good for the cause?  

My final warning is to make sure you know if open-carry is legal in your state and community.  We only need positive press for 2A issues right now!  Look here for information about where it's legal to open carry: http://www.opencarry.org/?page_id=103 but don't only use this.  Check with your local PD, and anyone else that would give you current information about your state and community!

**TL;DR** - I'm open carrying to create a positive image for gun rights in my community, and using any discussions that come from it to educate people about the current issues going on about 2A.  Read the post for information about why you might want to do this as well.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_170egb,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/170egb/ive_started_open_carrying_again_to_promote_a/,

It's lifted and it's old and it's ugly. As such, it has poor visibility and is not the fastest thing in the world. I like to drive it occasionally to work to keep the battery charged and the fluids circulated, but it's not something I drive often. ([Reference](http://imgur.com/2kYiBLD))

I also work about 15 miles from home. In those fifteen miles, like much of California, the area goes from so so to very nice. With that kind of money, the arrogance of the general populace skyrockets.

Anyhow, I'm on my way home and I remember that I need to mail something and so I signal to get over so I can find a place with my phone in a parking lot. A jeep in the next lane over about 4 car lengths back immediately starts accelerating when I turn my signal on as if to block me from getting over. I still have room so I get over and almost immediately pull into a parking lot. As I'm doing this the guy goes around me nearly missing me and another car in the lane I just merged from and speeds by doing probably close to double the speed limit. 

I'm not perfect. I flipped him off.

So there I am sitting in a parking lot fiddling with my phone in a beat up truck in a really nice part of town. Guess who turned around and came back to chat? Yeah, that guy. 

Now that I have a good look at him he seems typical of the area. Young twenty something who likely lives with his parents and spends too much time at the gym. I'm talking steroids big. He gets belligerent and calls me a little bitch and tells me I shouldn't be flipping him off. He went so far as to get out of his jeep only a 10 feet from me and threaten to pull me out of the car and whoop my ass. 

What did I do? I apologized. I felt so emasculated. At the end of the day though, I know I handled it as best as I could. He eventually left with a smirk on his face, but not after calling me more names. I just took it and let him leave.

One thing is for sure.

As CCWers (and really, firearm owners in general) we previously have had to stay on top of existing laws and regulations, both for legal reasons, and (more importantly IMHO), for ethical reasons.

However.

Will this ""having knowledge of the law implies the desire to circumvent the law"" argument be applied in the future? If GZ is convicted and this becomes a successful argument, will this have a chilling effect on people who (rightly) want to be knowledgeable about CCW/self-defense laws?

Previously, Maryland law held that an applicant for a weapons permit (concealed or open, MD makes no distinction) must prove to hold a 'good and substantial reason' to be granted a permit. Basically, only police officers/retired police officers, security personnel, employees who can prove they transport large sums of money after dark, and 'professionals' such as doctors, lawyers, etc, can be granted permits, and even then there is absolutely no guarantee.

Several months ago this was ruled unconstitutional, but before the law was formally overturned, an emergency stay was granted, basically putting us into Gun Permit Limbo.

Welp, on the 24th of October the federal 4th circuit court of appeals entertained oral arguments in favor of overturning Maryland's 'good and substantial reason' policy, and [the folks at marylandshallissue.org are ""cautiously optimistic that the 4th will uphold the ruling of the District Court.""](http://marylandshallissue.org/2012/10/woollard-at-the-4th-circuit-audio-and-analysis/) They're basically being optimistic on the basis that Judge King, the (only?) federal judge campaigning against a citizen's right to concealment in Maryland, danced around the 2nd Amendment for the entire hearing, choosing instead to focus on ridiculous arguments like long gun carry (""MD citizens can already feasibly carry a long gun for self defense, so why would they need a handgun?"" - note that if you were insane enough to try carrying a long gun in Maryland you would get bulldozed by an army of police regardless of the technical legality of the situation) and the danger of handguns (""only criminals use handguns! Why would the average citizen want to use the tool of a criminal?!"").

Basically the constitution is the higher law here, and the judge danced around the constitution for the entire hearing; if he actually thought that the second amendment didn't provide for citizens to carry a weapon for personal protection, he would've gone the constitutional route - but he didn't. A ruling is expected in the next 3-6 months, unless they decide that they really want to challenge the constitution, in which case it'll go to the SCOTUS and we're looking at another couple of years before we hear anything concrete.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_12c6k1,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/12c6k1/maryland_gun_rights_campaigners_cautiously/,

1340503208.0,46,self.CCW,via3o,TIL: My local Waffle House is run by a hoplophobic shit head.,Swrdfshtrmbns,68,22,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/via3o/til_my_local_waffle_house_is_run_by_a_hoplophobic/,"I am not certain if all franchises have the same policies, but this is my experience at my local Waffle House.

A Waffle House opened up on my block not too long ago, and since they're open 24/7 and I often have to get up early for work (before sunrise), it's a convenient way for me to get my dietary needs (I'm doing the /r/keto thing) if I'm in a hurry.  I noticed there was a sign on the door that said something to the effect of ""no firearms or deadly weapons unless authorized by law"".  Well, I thought, I am authorized by the state to carry a concealed firearm, so I'm fine.

The first few times I went there I openly carried my utility knife on my belt that I use for work (I am an organic farmer).  Nobody cared or said anything, and apparently at the hours I visited, there was no security guard.  My knife has previously never been a problem anywhere, even walking by cops, going into all sorts of retail stores, even grocery stores with off-duty cop security guards.  

The last time I went to Waffle House, I sat down at the counter and the server recognized me and said if I would like my order again, and I said yes, and off course he was super friendly because I tip extremely well.  Anyway, this manager was off-duty and sitting down the counter and looked at my knife.  He said, ""is that a knife?"" and I said, ""yes, it is"", and he said, ""that is not allowed in here, please leave"".  I gave him a funny look and said, ""I've been here several times and it hasn't been a problem, ever.  This guy even recognizes me.  I carry the knife because I am a farmer and it is a useful tool.""

He points me over to the sign and says, ""no deadly weapons, a knife is a deadly weapon.""  I argued that according to Ohio law, IT IS NOT UNLESS IT IS USED AS A WEAPON and that there is absolutely no law against open carrying knives of any size in Ohio (concealed is a different story).  A deadly weapon, under Ohio law, can be a lamp or a fork or anything that can cause serious bodily harm.  He wasn't having any of it.

So then I said, ""fine, I won't bring a knife in here if that's your policy, but what about firearms?"" (because if he unreasonably discriminates against one, I wanted to make sure I was OK with the other)

He says, ""you can't bring firearms in here.""  I say the sign says I can if I am authorized to carry a firearm.  He says, ""Only police and security guards can"".  I say that is not what the sign says.  He just says that's their policy.  He looks really pissed off, so I decide just to leave.  Never going back to Waffle House.  Fuck that.  Even Starbucks respects local laws and allows you to open carry firearms in their stores (even had a nice conversation with a knife-collecting barista about my knife).  Apparently Waffle House cannot trust their own customers.

I tried to contact Waffle House on their website about this, but apparently my local franchise is not supported by their customer contact submission thingy and I should call the franchise directly (which obviously isn't going to get anywhere).

(x post from /r/askanamerican),xenokilla,55,10,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/v61ek/the_4_reasons_i_carry_a_handgun_x_post_from/,"I posted [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/v4mmn/guns_i_own_several_i_also_carry_a_handgun_on_me/) in /r/AskAnAmerican and i thought there was some nice crossover to /r/ccw.

Question:
I'm a New Yorker, but still have some questions. Is there a reason you carry a concealed weapon? I know one person who has one, but she only carries it when she is alone on her boat. She had a friend who was attacked and robbed so she wanted the protection. I know that is wasn't easy for her to get the her ccw license, was it fairly easy in your state? Also, do you carry it with you all the time? If so I'm assuming for protection? Do you live/work in a dangerous area and how quickly would you be willing to use it?

My reply:
&gt;Is there a reason you carry a concealed weapon?

I assume your asking why i carry in general as opposed to open carry.

I guess there are 4 reasons.

1. Because i can. I know that sounds silly but there is just something to it I've always liked.

2. Self defense. Kinda of obvious, but I don't live in a very dangerous area (northern Indiana, but not near Chicago

3. To express my constitutional rights. Its kinda of self explanatory but i feel that our rights as citizens are being slowly eroded, so this is the one thing i can do everyday to show my support for the constitution.

4. I'm Jewish. I grew up knowing people who went through the Camps. I know its a very slim possibility, but I'm not going out like that dammit.

A lot of the people here are new to firearm handling, purchasing, and most importantly carrying. Most people cannot afford the exorbitant fees associated with formal training either, and that's totally understandable.

*Anyone* can shoot a gun and put a hole in a paper target. That's the easy part. But how many people know how to fight with one?

**So, to this end, I have decided to make some videos for you all that will be welcomed to be placed on the sidebar should enough interest be found here** since I have no other reason to keep my knowledge to myself.

Starting with this thread, you Redditors can ask any questions you would like regarding...

* Use of Force continuums
* AOJP and other applicable ""before you shoot"" considerations
* conflict de-escalation
* tactical considerations in a firefight
* stances and pros and cons
* carry techniques
* drawing (5-stage, etc.)
* marksmanship
* Scenarios (i.e. ""If a situation like this happens, what do I do?"")

and other related topics. If the question requires it (I imagine most will), I will happily demonstrate myself with my own firearm so other carriers can learn by seeing and modify the techniques to their own needs and practice as their time allows.

NOTE: Please do not ask any ""legal"" questions outside of considerations before drawing and/or shooting, questions about preferred kit, etc. **IANAL, a firearms instructor, etc., and always consult your state, county, and municipal laws. Anything I teach is what works for me -- it may not work for you the same way, so adapt it as necessary.**

I'll prefer questions that can be demonstrated and can be used to teach other carriers, so please take the time to upvote those questions.

Why The Gun Is Civilization
By Marko Kloos
March 23, 2007
http://munchkinwrangler.wordpress.com/2007/03/23/why-the-gun-is-civilization/

Human beings only have two ways to deal with one another: reason and force. If you want me to do something for you, you have a choice of either convincing me via argument, or force me to do your bidding under threat of force. Every human interaction falls into one of those two categories, without exception. Reason or force, that’s it.

In a truly moral and civilized society, people exclusively interact through persuasion. Force has no place as a valid method of social interaction, and the only thing that removes force from the menu is the personal firearm, as paradoxical as it may sound to some.

When I carry a gun, you cannot deal with me by force. You have to use reason and try to persuade me, because I have a way to negate your threat or employment of force. The gun is the only personal weapon that puts a 100-pound woman on equal footing with a 220-pound mugger, a 75-year old retiree on equal footing with a 19-year old gangbanger, and a single gay guy on equal footing with a carload of drunk guys with baseball bats. The gun removes the disparity in physical strength, size, or numbers between a potential attacker and a defender.

There are plenty of people who consider the gun as the source of bad force equations. These are the people who think that we’d be more civilized if all guns were removed from society, because a firearm makes it easier for a mugger to do his job. That, of course, is only true if the mugger’s potential victims are mostly disarmed either by choice or by legislative fiat–it has no validity when most of a mugger’s potential marks are armed. People who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the young, the strong, and the many, and that’s the exact opposite of a civilized society. A mugger, even an armed one, can only make a successful living in a society where the state has granted him a force monopoly.

Then there’s the argument that the gun makes confrontations lethal that otherwise would only result in injury. This argument is fallacious in several ways. Without guns involved, confrontations are won by the physically superior party inflicting overwhelming injury on the loser. People who think that fists, bats, sticks, or stones don’t constitute lethal force watch too much TV, where people take beatings and come out of it with a bloody lip at worst. The fact that the gun makes lethal force easier works solely in favor of the weaker defender, not the stronger attacker. If both are armed, the field is level. The gun is the only weapon that’s as lethal in the hands of an octogenarian as it is in the hands of a weightlifter. It simply wouldn’t work as well as a force equalizer if it wasn’t both lethal and easily employable.

When I carry a gun, I don’t do so because I am looking for a fight, but because I’m looking to be left alone. The gun at my side means that I cannot be forced, only persuaded. I don’t carry it because I’m afraid, but because it enables me to be unafraid. It doesn’t limit the actions of those who would interact with me through reason, only the actions of those who would do so by force. It removes force from the equation…and that’s why carrying a gun is a civilized act.

I was meeting my insurance agent for lunch to go over a few business things.  One was insurance for my gun collection. He grew up on a farm and is generally cool about guns. When we were talking about my guns he asked if I had a CCW and immediately followed up with ""do you have a gun on your right now?""

Needless to say, I was caught off guard, and I'm pretty sure my awkward pause gave away the answer.  He quickly said ""Nevermind, you don't have to answer that, sorry.""

It got me thinking that I should prepare a default response.  I do hang out with people who talk about guns, shooting, hunting occasionally, so I'm sure the subject of CCW will come up from time to time.

Do you guys have a personal policy when it comes to discussing CCW among friends?  What about if you don't know everyone in the conversation well? Obviously, I avoid the topic in unfamiliar company.  So if the topic came up in a group in which you did not know everyone's feeling about guns, would you lie, misdirect, tell it like it is?

Thoughts?,throw_me_out707,62,18,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1amtxo/this_guy_should_not_have_a_ccw_thoughts/,"I'll mention up front that I own two rifles cause I think it's important for you all to know that I'm not anti-gun by any stretch.

In July of last yr I was riding the bike through the local park here in California (Solano County). I was passing a two people (man/woman) and words were exchanged between myself and the male, it was a very minor disagreement (no cursing or even anger,on my part at least) and I moved on, thinking nothing more of it. (I won't get too specific here because I'm concerned that doing so my be problematic if this goes to court) 

I usually park the car a few blocks away from the park entrance because it's easier to exit. As I was mounting my bike on my car rack the man who I had that very minor confrontation with drove by and yelled: *“Fucking homo”*  out his window.

I flipped him off so he made a U-turn then parked approximately 50-60 feet down the block on the same side of the street.  He then exited his car and started walking toward me in a threatening manner. As he neared me I stopped what I was doing, turned to face him and at that time he pulled out a small, greyish 22 caliber revolver, pointed it directly at my face, then asked me: *“Do you want to fuck around now?”*

I answered *“No, I do not”* at which point he spun around and started walking back to his vehicle. At this time I was dialing the police at which point he noticed my phone in hand and said *“That's OK, I have a concealed carry and I felt threatened”*

Which is ridiculous considering **he turned his car around and approached me** as I was attempting to mount/secure my bike and stow my items in my car.

I did call the police but the officer didn't take a written statement, he did go into a local business to see if they had outdoor cameras with footage (they didn't) . He asked me if anyone else witnessed, I said no.  He said that they had him pulled over up the hwy and that his story was very different than mine. He then had me drive over to the location to where they had him pulled over. They had him and his fat girlfriend sitting on a curb and they were positioned in such a way that they couldn't see me when I walked up to identify them. The officer informed me that it was my word against his but that he'll forward it to the DA. 

A few days pass and I get a phone call from that officer and he informs me that the man who pulled a gun on me wrote me an apology and that the man wanted him to forward said apology to me. A few minutes later that officer arrived with a printed copy of the apology in hand. The officer also informs me that the man's statement *changed* drastically but mine was consistent and that mine made sense where his didn't make sense. *But* the chances were slim that the man would be indicted because there were no witnesses.

I believe this man should not have a CCW because he has demonstrated a propensity toward violence as he has brandished his weapon at me for no reason other than his anger.

I have waited this long to pursue because I thought the 'justice' system was just moving slow but it has become clear that they're not pursuing this further.

Questions: 
1) Does anyone know of official channels I can file a complaint against his CCW? I HAVE googled this extensively but google is not my friend in this instance.

2)Is there a way to file any sort of paperwork with the local DA office with my concerns as to the case (The cop never took a written statement and I'd like to paint a clear picture for the DA) 

3) What would you do,CCW Reddit? Would you let this go knowing there's a guy like this with a CCW or would you pursue? After all he shoved a gun in my face *for no reason.* (Other than feeling powerful)

I'm not seeking legal advice;more along the lines of maybe: *""Go to the DA office and look for form #xx and then for the CCW complaint go to this office and look for form #xx""*

I don't have $$ for a lawyer BTW.

I offered a number of reasons why I think a blanket policy outlawing firearms is a bad idea, and suggested that we write in an exception allowing those of us (like myself) who have a CHL to carry at work with manager approval.

My boss agreed that we (as a company) should have a more open conversation than just the small management team. As a result, he would like me to come speak to the group, express my opinion, and answer any questions as a representative of responsible concealed carry.

My wife wanted to take it, so I tagged along as a refresher and to keep her company. It was a 4 hour, no-range class that will meet my local Sheriff's shall-issue requirements.

Ok, I know I am being overly critical, as I regularly instruct for my profession, but these guys simply did not know what they were talking about. Numerous comments about liberals, socialists, and the like were said, but I was mentally prepared for those. *What bugged me most is below:*

They started the class by skipping over a great number of the NRA provided slides, as we ""would get back to those later"", though we never did. When they did cover some of that material, they didn't use the nice graphics and slides the NRA provided, instead they covered it with poor descriptions and half ass examples. Lots of 'this', 'those', 'them', etc. Everybody was glassy eyed and I fear almost nobody knew what a double-action or single-action pistol was in the end.

Next, they talked about several examples from their ""extensive training classes"" they flew somewhere to take. In these examples, they lied repeatedly about seeing **in person** a ""large drug cop afercan-black fella"" shoot himself in the foot (lie, youtube, http://bit.ly/30aLcm), and a woman being handed a large caliber pistol and it going off twice due to recoil and shooting the person behind her (lie, youtube video). *Yes, I believe they said she shot somebody literally in front of them at their training.*

They made us stand up in front of the class and show our stance. I used my regular aggressive isosceles stance, but they said I was doing it wrong. I was forced to use more of a weaver stance and stand up straight, because ""Don't lower your head into the gun at all. Nobody shoots like that any more. Yull hurt yurself er somethen I think.""

Another thing that made me absolutely furious was the local sheriff had graciously made slides for them to use (which they skipped most of), and when they showed a slide listing the common effects of high-stress situations (tachypsychia, reduced motor skills, narrowing of vision, etc), *they had no idea what those where.* ""I don't know what most of those are, but if you practice a little, these things don't happen to you, so I don't know why these are on the slides. These are mostly things that happen after a shootin""

Lastly, they barely covered where you can, and can't carry a concealed weapon. It was in the last 5 minutes of class, they just said ""any federal buildings, the sheriff should give you a list"". And that was it. Class over. I was utterly flabbergasted. 

Tid-bits:

* They didn't know what the castle doctrine was, so they skipped that slide. 

* They said that all guns without safeties are dangerous. ""Don't buy Glocks, M&amp;P's, or XD's"".

* About the Clackamas, OR shooting: ""I heard there was a concealer there, but he didn't take the shot, and two people died. You see... that's wrong. I would have put him down.""

**TLDR; Horrible CCW class. Made me want to get my NRA basic pistol instructor cert to teach classes.**

Were my rights violated?,Dr_Crapface,55,11,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/134u3d/police_encounter_while_ccwing_were_my_rights/,"I was pulled over while driving this weekend, and wasn't completely sure the cop could legally do everything he did. Here goes:

While driving at night on a multiple-lane road, I was pulling up to a stoplight and noticed the lane next to me was empty. A police car had just switched lanes to be behind me, and I signaled and switched lanes to be first in line at the light without thinking anything of it. I looked in my rearview mirror as I pulled out on the green, and noticed the police car back behind me again. After a few blocks he turned on his lights and pulled me over.

He approached the vehicle and asked me if I knew my license plate lights were both out. (I'm pretty sure he just thought I was acting suspicious and came up with a BS excuse to pull me over.) I informed him that I wasn't aware of that. He asked me for my license and registration, and I told him it was in my wallet in my back pocket and asked if I could retrieve it. I was under the impression that this makes a law enforcement officer more at ease before you reach somewhere he can't see. However, I think in this case it made him a little more wary. He asked if I was carrying any weapons, and I told him ""I have a concealed carry permit, and I am carrying tonight."" (My state doesn't require me to inform unless asked.) He asked me where the weapon was, and I informed him that it was in my right hip pocket. (Kel-Tec P32)

At this point he told me that he would require me to surrender my weapon for the duration of the traffic stop and asked me to step out of the car and put my hands against the roof. He frisked me and pulled the gun out of my pocket, dropped the mag and cleared the chamber. (It wasn't chambered anyway.) Then he had me go sit on the hood of his car while he checked to make sure the gun wasn't stolen. 

This is where I'm not sure about the legality of his actions. Can an officer run a registration check on a firearm with no probable cause? At the end of the traffic stop, he also told me he wasn't comfortable handing me my gun back loaded. So he told - NOT ASKED - me that he was going to open my trunk and place the gun on the floor, and I could retrieve it when he pulled away. As he was reaching for my trunk handle, I briefly considered telling him ""I don't consent to any searches,"" but realized it would probably just result in him searching my entire car and detaining me for at least another half hour. There was absolutely nothing in the trunk except for two camping chairs, but it was a matter of principle. Had the trunk contained more legally purchased firearms, I'm sure he would have run all their serial numbers through the police database as well.

Reliability: I had 2 FTE's my first box of ammo. And 1 in my second box. After those three failure to ejects, I have not had one more FTF or FTE or malfunction of any kind. These could have been a problem with my grip, or could have just been since the pistol was brand new. Either way, no problems in the last 900 I have shot.

Ammo: takes everything I feed it fine. Remington UMC, Federal, Bronze, and fired a box of 124 +p gold dots without a hiccup and therefore is my carry ammo. The three FTE's that I mentioned earlier was in the Remington UMC, and again, no provls in the last 900 shots.

Trigger: I feel it broke in just a touch. Either it broke in, or my hand broke in to it. One or the other, the pull is great, and the reset is perfect. No complaints at all. Recoil is also extremely light. Not just for a pistol it's size, but for any pistol.

Accuracy: my first magazine was one of the best patterns I had ever fired. Probably really excited. Either way, the pistol shoots where you want it, and does so at any range I can find at an indoor range. Shot it outside and the minimum was 15 yards (45 feet) and that was the farthest I'd hope to do, but could still easily hit a silhouette.

Concealment: I carry it at 4:00 in a theis iwb holster. Just like the super tuck. I can't speak highly enough for Tommy Theis' work, but I'm going to stay on the shield. I'm a big dude with a spare tire. I've been dropping a lot this year, but it's still there. I can iwb it nicely. Really doesn't get in my way, and it is thin enough that it fits in my jeans without needing to get a bigger size.

I paid a full $450 for mine, high, but I got one. The extra didn't matter since the first shop I tried had them available. Even at full price, totally worth it. I really couldn't be happier. My dad is searching for one now, his beretta tomcat he ""loved"" took a giant shit and the frame, not slide, crumbled... I've always hated that gun.

Id be happy to help anyone and answer any questions you have. If I left something out that you want to know, ask and you shall receive, just put it in a comment. Any pics or comparison pictures, I will be happy to post them upon request as well.
Hope you enjoyed reading.

All of a sudden I hear a loud scream as I feel something sharply hit the back of my shouder/neck, followed by a loud pop.  At this point I'm wondering what the hell just happened.

I quickly identify the situation and realize that some drunk idiots threw a (seemingly full) beer bottle out of their car, and the pop was just the glass breaking, but for a second there I honestly was fearing for my life.  My mind was racing, but I realized that if it had been a gun I would have heard the pop first, and that it wasn't nearly loud enough.  My first instinct was to retaliate, which I had to go against.  

I paused for a second to make sure I was ok, and then started chasing.  Couldn't get a license plate, and they ran the red light at the intersection before I could run and catch them.  (not to shoot, but to get the plate)

Anyway, that's probably the first time I felt the urge to draw my weapon, but I'm glad I didn't.  It's good to know that I'm able to keep my cool in a situation like that though.

I expressed this to my bf and he told his friend not to bring it out when I'm around, which also kind of pissed me off, but anyway, my bf doesn't have a problem with it.

My dad has been in Alabama at my grandfather's house and so he drove my grandfather's car back to Texas to pick me up. 

I was driving, had it set on cruise and was apparently following a truck too close and so was stopped by a Texas state trooper.

He walks up to the vehicle and asks for a driver's license, and I hand him my Texas driver's license and pistol permit, and tell him I'm armed.

He asks me to step out of the vehicle and asks if it is on my person, I say yes and point at my hip. He tells me to turn around, and when I do he lifts my shirt and takes my SIG, placing it in his belt. 

He asks why I was following the truck so close, and I told him as soon as I realized I was that close, he was already there, and I couldn't move over.

He noted I lived in Texas, and asked who owned the car. I said it was my grandfather's, and he asked if that was him in the car. I said, no, that is my dad, and I'm sure he was skeptical then because my dad is Japanese (he's actually my stepdad).

He then tried to get my story straight: my dad and I live in Texas. My grandfather lives in Alabama. My grandfather passed away, my dad drove back to San Antonio and now were both driving back to the funeral.

He then asks for insurance. I explain that my insurance company provides liability for any car I drive, but my dad might have insurance specifically for the car. He then checks that, comes back, stares at my licenses a bit. 

After a pause he hands my licenses back, hands the pistol back to me, and tells me I can leave.

I have read other people's accounts and have always found them interesting so I'd like to contribute.

Background: I live in Florida and it is not required to inform and officer you are carrying unless asked and I carry a glock 9mm iwb at 5 o'clock

I was driving to my friends house and came too stop at a stop sign and made a right hand turn. Down the road I see two officers standing outside of their cruisers about an 1/8 of a mile from the stop sign. One was a much older officer and another was a younger officer in his 20s that seemed to be a rookie.

The younger officer steps into the middle of the road and gestured for me to come to a stop. I rolled down my window and stopped. He told me to pull over in front of where their cruisers were parked. I asked if I was being detained. He replies this is a traffic stop. I ask what I did and he said I rolled a stop sign and to move because I'm obstructing traffic.

I pull over and immediately gathered my driver's license, ccw license, registration, proof of insurance before he walks to my window. I hand the documents and he looks over them and asks if I have an weapons. 

I reply ""Yes""

He asks ""Where is it?""

I reply ""My right hip.""

At this point I see an expression on his face of being nervous and unsettled. He immediately says some code on his radio and walks away from the car and talks to the other older officer. He comes back after about 1 minute and asks me to put my hands in air and step out of the car.  I open the door and move to exit the vehicle when I notice my wallet on my lap. I ask him if I can grab my wallet, he does not respond so I wait with my hands up and sat their for maybe 7 seconds before he takes my wallet off my lap and puts it on my car. I step out and he instructs me to face my car. The older officer comes over and disarms me. They seemed to be having trouble removing the gun from my kydex holster and I asked them ""Please be careful, it is loaded"". He says ok and removes the gun and unloads it. The other officer pats me down. At this time I inform him that I do not consent to any searches or seizures of my person. He doesn't respond and removes a pocket knife from my pocket.

He told me to sit back down in my car. The older officer then comes over and tells me they pulled me over for making ""the perfect rolling stop"". He said I didn't blow the stop sign going 15 mph but I nearly came to a complete stop but didn't. He asked if I was a student and I responded I was a first year medical student. He asks and few more questions in a friendly manner and we make small talk for a couple minutes. He then leaves and comes back with his partner and hand me my knife and unloaded gun with slide locked back with the magazine removed. They let me go with a warning and I was on my way.

The whole stop probably took about 15 minutes. I was happy not getting a ticket and felt the whole experience went well. Though I did not enjoy being disarmed I came away with an overall positive experience. I have more respect for my law enforcement officers today than I did yesterday.

TL;DR I was stopped for making ""the perfect rolling stop"" ordered out of my car, disarmed, and patted down. Then was sent on my way with a warning after they returned my knife and glock 19.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_1fg84b,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1fg84b/first_encounter_with_law_enforcement_with_ccw/,

It was a minor fender bender from the sound of it with a head light broken so I didn't think much of it. Then I heard the woman yelling at the man who hit her,  ""Hey jackass my three year old is still in there"" at this point I jogged across the street to see what was going on. Two men who are both high on what I would guess to be heroin were repeatedly ramming into the back of the woman's SUV trying to flee the scene.  At this point three other drivers pulled up alongside and behind the cars to block him in. The men continued to ram the back of the woman 's SUV, after she had removed her child, so she asked me to put on her emergency break. As I walked to her car the driver dad contemplating driving between the SUV and a parked truck, both had their doors open to prevent this. I honestly believe the only thing that stopped him from trying was the fact I was standing there and he was sober enough to realize that hitting a person would get him in much more trouble. At this point he got frustrated turned off his keys And threw them into the street. I proceeded to grab them. As soon as I did he climbed out of the Window And began advancing on me with a knife he had had in his pocket. As soon as I saw this I tossed the keys to his feet bit he still continued to come at me. Luckily for myself the police were finally getting to the scene once he heard the sirens he decided to drop the knife And stumble away. Where the officer preceded to take him to the ground. 

I apologize for the wall of text, I left the scene 10 minutes ago And nerves are still on edge.

**Edit #2: They were going 55mph on a 45 mph empty three lane road.** they were **NOT** street racing or exceeding 35 mph in the neighborhood. The speed limit in the neighborhood is **30 mph** hence why my neighbor had no chance to get rid of the Toyota.

So I live in a small area, I know all my neighbors and one of my neighbors drives a NICE Mercedes convertible. She's in her late 50s, it's an AMG of some sort. Today (9:12pm) I was about two miles away from home and I pulled up behind her. There was a red Toyota corolla, 1993-1995, next to her. Two Indian (dot on forehead) males roughly 16-17. She tends to drive ""Spirited"", **up to 55 mph in a 45 mph zone** my neighbor and I like to mess around. **up to 55 mph in a 45 mph area when ww pull up next to each other** My car has 1/3rd the horsepower hers does so she'll count to three and then beat me to 55 mph for giggles. Well the little Toyota decided to ""race"" her. **my neighbor and the Toyota were racing, not me**

The road went from two lanes to three lanes. She went **straight** in to the left lane (our turn was a mile down the road on the left) and the Toyota went on the far right lane. **I hung back to watch the ""race"" to 55 mph** She went to go in the turn lane to go into the development **where both me and my neighbor live** and the **Toyota** SLAMMED on their brakes and swerved across two lanes to pull up behind **my neighbor**.

This is when I realize something is horribly wrong.

As she turns left the **Toyota** stayed within 2 feet of her bumper. She takes off, trying to lose them but she is old and scared and **didn't have many chances to really accelerate** because she is taking every turn she could. I decided to make sure she is OK and it increasingly becomes obvious **the toyota doesn't live here** and they are waiting for her to stop somewhere for whatever reason.

Finally she fakes a left and swerves right. They were so worried about not hitting her, they end up going straight, down a dead end. I stop my car blocking the road, **the passenger ditches the driver and runs into some woods**. The kid rolls down his window, ""Hey fuckin asshole, move your car, I got places to be!"" And I said, ""If you have a problem with my neighbor, you can settle it with me.""

Now, I don't have my CCW permit YET but my state is open carry so I carry my G21 open carry any time I step out the door so I'll be used to the bulk on my hip. 

**He stepped out of the car first** (he was about 20 yards away) and said, ""Fucking bring it old man."" That is when **HE charged at **me** while I was still in my car.

So I stepped out and he saw the gun **still holstered on my hip** and he raised his hands up (**my hands were nowhere near the gun nor did I motion towards it**) and he said, ""Whoa! Please don't shoot me! I was just havin some fun! Playin around! I wasn't gonna hurt anyone I swear! Please let me go! I'll go straight home! Please! Please! Please!"" He is practically at tears.

At this point I was VERY aware of the gun on my hip and my adrenaline was pounding and I said, ""Just go home and leave us alone."" Then I got back in my car, moved it, and followed him out of the development.

Then I went to my neighbors house and **we called the police, filed a police report and got a case number.** If either of us see them again, we're gonna write down the license plate number and inform the Sargent in charge of our case.

WOW! I haven't had that much adrenaline in YEARS!

I know it wasn't a concealed story but this seemed like the best place to post it.

________________________________________________________________________________________

Decided to make a diagram To explain things.

The reason I followed after them is because A) I live next to my neighor so I had every reason to be there, and the toyota pulled this number:

That's when the Toyota first swerved across two lanes when it was obvious they were originally intending to go straight. Once again, I live next to my neighbor, so it makes sense for me to be going into the development.

Then throughout the turn into the development the Toyota stayed within a couple feet of her bumper. To get to our side street you have to take a 2 lefts, a right, 3 more lefts, and then another right. There's only 5 houses on our little side street and I know everyone on our street and he was NOT someone who lived on our street. Their car was old and had rust and none of my neighbors have kids. They're all in their 50s+

The only thing that would have changed if I didn't have a gun, is the kid would have probably attacked me. The fact that I had a gun had no bearing on what happened. **I didn't motion towards the gun, I didn't pull out the gun, I didn't threaten him with the gun.** When he said, ""Please don't shoot me"" I didn't put the barrel in his mouth, I just said, ""Please go home and leave us alone.""

Now, **I SHOULD NOT HAVE confronted him.** I know that now. The correct thing to do would have been to get his license plate and call the police.

I carry both a Ruger SR9c and an LCP. The LCP is kept in the slot under my radio in my SUV for quick access while in the vehicle.

Story inside.,schrute_beet_farms,61,18,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1inkjq/i_have_never_been_more_happy_to_carry_concealed/,"Long story short, about a year and a half ago I was working on a ""friend's"" car and found out that there were opened containers in his car and probably dope from his son. I decided to stop working on his shit bc he was so shady. I didn't answer calls or anything bc I was seriously fed up with his crap. So, last night around 7:40 I had parked my car in a small parking lot and the only way to leave was to back out. This guy saw me and pulled into the parking lot like a bat out of hell and blocked me in. I see him in my side mirror and knew he wasn't coming over for a tea party. I jumped out of my car and faced him. He proceeded to call me everything under the sun and said he had half a mind to beat my ass (he kept saying that dumb saying.) I knew if I showed any opposition that he'd come at me bc he was already inching forward. He was about 5 feet from me. I casually put my hands in my pockets and kept them there, bc my S&amp;W Bodyguard 380 was in there. I made a loud cough so I could turn my safety off. Bear in mind I did NOT want to have to draw on him, so I just let him yell at me as said nothing back. I had such peace of mind knowing I had a pistol in my hand in case e did anything. He ended up cussing some more and then left. Later that night I filed a police report and they said they were already well aware of him. I guess he's quite the douchebag.

I actually forgot about this since it happened so long ago. 

I was 22 years old having owned my first gun (a Ruger P90 .45) for around 6 months. I had a CCW permit but rarely carried it. Was more for convenience in transporting it. 

I was driving home from night school when I gassed it at an intersection and the light turned red before I got across. I was immediately pulled over by a cop staking out that intersection. 

The gun was underneath my seat and I knew based on the floor design it couldn't have slipped out so I couldn't understand why the officer was acting so strangely. 

He asked me what the vinyl case was in the backseat. I had no idea and began to reach for it. ""DON""T MOVE. DON""T REACH BACK THERE"" he said. I asked him ""What vinyl case? I don't know what you are talking about. I can't help you if I can't reach back there. Do you mean my cassette case?""  ""NO"" he replied. So finally he lets me fish my arm in back of me while looking straight ahead. I was like a 2-3 minute game of hot and cold until finally my hand grabs the vinyl object he is concerned about. 

Whoops !

It was my empty triangular shaped gun case. 

I handed it to him. He shines a flashlight into the obviously empty case ""Is there a gun in here?""  ""No officer"". He asks me if I have a gun in the car which I reply, ""Yes I do, it's under the seat and my concealed permit is on the inside of the visor.""

He asks me to step out and move to the rear of the car. I immediately place my hands on the trunk and remain cool. 

Both officers now search the entire car, take the gun, and several other items from the car. They ask me in a very serious tone ""What are you planning?"" 

I'm a bit confused as to why he thinks I am up to something. ""Nothing"" I replied. He says ""Then what are you doing with a loaded .45 caliber cannon in the car and these books?""

This was early 1992 after the 1st Gulf War and I was heavily into reading about the subject, including military tactics. 

The 3 books I had in the car along with the gun were:

* It Doesn't Take a Hero - Norman Schwarzkopf's Autobiography
* The Art of War - Sun Tzu
* How to Make War (A Comprehensive Guide to Modern Warfare in the Twenty-first Century) - James Dunnigan

1331370902.0,43,self.CCW,qq4l1,Things to consider before buying a carry gun.,XrayZach,47,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/qq4l1/things_to_consider_before_buying_a_carry_gun/,"Thoughts on CCW guns 

My younger brother is in the market for his first carry pistol. I typed up my thoughts for him and thought some people here might be interested too. Sorry it's so long.

 Preface: These are just my opinions about things to consider before purchasing a 
pistol for conceal carry. The actual facts about gun dimensions, bullet and 
caliber performance, shooting statistics and methods of carry are available 
online. Every single person is going to have differing opinions about how to 
apply these facts. My main goal is to just show the areas you should consider 
before purchase without getting into my opinions too much. 

 1) The gun must be reliable and must be something you will carry every day. This 
point basically summarizes all the other points to follow. You must be able to 
trust your life to this machine; that means it should always function without 
error, every single time. With this it must also be something you will carry 
with you every day or there is no point in wasting money on it. A .22 in your 
pocket is infinitely better than a shotgun locked up at home when you need it.  

 2) Size is the next thing to consider. You are looking for a concealable 
firearm...so...it must be concealable. There is a balancing act here, the 
smaller the gun the harder to shoot but easier to carry, you need something big 
enough to hold onto but small enough to stick in your pants. Your body shape is 
going to determine a lot about how much gun you can hide, the smaller you are 
the harder it gets to make a big gun disappear. Think about the barrel length, 
long barrels are harder to draw from concealment and harder to hide, but 
inversely, easier to shoot accurately. Thickness comes into play with comfort, 
the thicker the gun the less room you have in your pants for your ass. If you 
carry outside the waistband the bigger the gun gets the bigger your gun shaped 
tumor will grow for the world to see. The grip is probably the hardest part of 
the gun to conceal (for me any ways) and the length of the grip must be 
considered. Shorter grips stick out less but hold fewer rounds. 

 3) Next up we have weight. A heavy gun is easier on the hand with recoil and 
easier to shoot accurately but is much more of a drain on you to carry around 
all day. You want a gun light enough it won't pull your pants off, if it's a 
constant bother, you won't carry it. The heavier the gun is the more annoying it 
becomes. Polymer framed pistols are a great way to save on weight and are 
durable enough to stand the test of time. Weight, more than size, is what caused 
me to purchase a different CCW gun, that big hunk of metal on your hip becomes a 
real drain really quick. The rounds in the gun, the bigger the gun and steel 
frames are all going to add weight and you must find the right balance that 
works for you personally.  

 4.) Capacity, how many rounds of ammunition do you need? Enough to take care of 
business, unfortunately you won't know how many that is until you count how many 
bullets flew after a gun fight. So carry as many as it takes to make you feel 
safe. If you feel secure with five rounds in a snubby, good for you. But as the 
saying goes, better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. 
Ideally, carry the most ammo you can carry comfortably. It's going to differ for 
every person. The average gunfight is often said to be less than three rounds 
fired total, but what good are averages if your gunfight happens to need ten 
rounds from you?  Does your gun use single or double stack mags? Single mags are 
slimmer and will be easier to carry a second one if you want but hold less 
rounds. Every situation is different and you can't plan for all of them so again 
carry what makes you feel safe and what you will actually carry. 

 5) Caliber, oh god the opinions are coming! You will find more disagreement and 
opinions on this than anything else hands down. I'm going to keep it simply 
here. No rimfire, period. There is not enough lead to produce the energy you 
will need and even expensive rimfire loads have a higher rate of failure than 
centerfire loads. There is also no reason to carry a .32 caliber, basically 
anyone that makes a .32 will make the exact same gun (weigh and size) in .380 
also, so you gain nothing and lose firepower carrying a .32 caliber pistol. 
After that all I will say is the bigger the bullet the more energy you will have 
leaving the barrel but you will either lose capacity or have to carry a bigger 
gun. Look up penetration and energy charts for the calibers you are interested 
in and decide what works for you. When it comes down to it, shot placement is 
the most important thing. Unless you carry a pocket RPG you have to hit vitals 
before caliber is going to make a difference.  

 6) Buy quality, hollow point ammunition. I'm not going to tell you this brand is 
better than that brand but this is not the place to cheap out. In the end the 
bullet does all the work, everything else is just a delivery system so the 
bullet can do its job. Watch videos on YouTube and look at penetration and 
expansion test charts and decide what brand you want, and then make sure it 
functions IN YOUR FIREARM. You should practice with the same weight bullet you 
plan to carry but make sure you also put a few boxes of carry ammo through your 
gun to test function and make sure point of aim is the same as your practice 
stuff. Also remember to rotate your ammo every now and then. 

 7) What type of holster and where on your body will you carry? If you are dead 
set on a certain style holster make sure they make it for the firearm you are 
looking to purchase. Also if you are buying a new model gun (not recommended for 
a carry gun) holsters can be hard to find for awhile. Practice drawing and 
carrying in different locations on your body and from different positions, .i.e. 
standing, sitting, laying down on your back and belly, crouching ect. Find what 
is most comfortable and has the best access and concealment for you. There is no 
right answer on carry method, it will differ for everyone, but the gun must be 
easy to get to in a hurry. I recommend always carrying in the same position so 
you never have to think about where the gun is. In a stress situation your brain 
shuts down and you need to be able to do things w/o too much thought. PRACTICE 
DRAWING over and over until it becomes instinct and practice with different 
types of clothing. If you have access to different size handguns and holsters 
(family or friends or other guns in your personal collection) try carrying 
different size guns around the house for a few hours in different positions on 
your body, see what will work for you. Stand, sit, stretch and walk around to 
see what you can comfortably conceal. 

 8) What features do you want on the gun? External safety, slide lock, big or 
slim sights, night sights, hammer or striker fired, and trigger pull and weight 
are all things to consider. Every gun is different and there are a lot of 
options out there. There are pluses and minuses for everything on the list, find 
a model gun that you like. Gun stores love your money and most will be happy to 
let you play with all the guns you want until you find what suits your needs. 

 9) Cost. This is not the time to buy a high point, seriously I don't care if it 
has a lifetime warranty, you don't, so don't buy one for a CCW gun. If your deer 
rifle jams up you might miss the deer, if your .22 pistol malfunctions the soda 
can may live another day, but if your carry weapon fails when you need it you 
are in a serious world of hurt. Buy a quality gun with a solid reputation, this 
is why I said earlier not to buy a brand new model, there just won't be enough 
reviews out there to judge the gun by and many first runs have issues that still 
need to be worked out. If you want to save money here then don't get a fancy 
engraved finish with gold plating, I think it will be ok to skip that, but buy a 
quality functioning weapon.  

 10) All things considered you must like the final product. If you don't like the 
gun, even if it meets all of your checklist, there are tons of other options out 
there. Some things can't be summed up with words and if the gun just doesn't do 
it for you personally, find one that does. 

 A few final thoughts to consider before you start to carry a weapon. First, 
everything for a CCW gun is a compromise, what you gain in concealment you give 
up in function and vise versa. You need to remember that you are not buying a 
combat weapon, you are buying a last ditch machine to help you out of a life or 
death situation when you have no other options. You are not a badass because you 
have a gun, you should blend in and look like everybody else. Never be the cause 
of the scene, never do anything with a gun you wouldn't do without one. And 
finally you have to decide wether you are capable of taking a human life if you 
have to. That's not a fun question and one I hope you never have to actually use 
the answer on, but it's a question you must ask yourself and decide beforehand 
if you are willing to end someone's life to continue yours. ",,False,,t5_2s4mc,True,,,True,t3_qq4l1,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/qq4l1/things_to_consider_before_buying_a_carry_gun/,

I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't thrilled. I wasn't losing control of the weapon at all, but I tend to get sweaty palms and after a full days of shooting, I just wouldn't have the positive contact I desired. Since this was my carry gun, I was worried I could be in a situation, on a hot day where I had been active and  with all this: it could be harder for me to control my weapon. While it's unlikely I ever need to draw and even more unlikely this is the situation in which I'm drawing in, why not be prepared?  

I found a few places that offered after market grip options, but they seemed expensive and I'm a DIY kinda of guy. I picked up a sheet of [black griptape](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAQVYS/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_ST1_dp_1) from Amazon for a grand total of $8.00. Also obligatory notice, if you use Amazon, use the [SAF Link](http://www.saf.org/amazon/). I traced the design of the grip from the pistol onto paper, then onto the griptape and cut with an old pair of scissors (griptape, sandpaper, etc will fuck up your scissors over time).

I've been quite happy with the end result. Due to the contour of the pistol, it doesn't sit perfectly flat, but the small ridges conform to my hand. The only downside is that I don't wear an undershirt, so at the beginning it would scratch me slightly, especially when turning around while seated. After wearing and using it a bit, the extreme grit seems to have subsided and I no longer notice it. The grip has increased by magnitude and it feels great in my hand.

He does not come from a family that has had guns and I have known he isn't exactly fond of them for a long time before we were close so I have never mentioned guns or the fact that I CCW to him at all.  He is a great guy but I didn't want to worry about what he would think about having guns all over the house.

Cutting to the chase, I keep my Taurus .45 in a special compartment in my large bench desk (where the work light is) that is completely concealed and pretty safe.  It stays loaded in my IWB holster there so I have easy access while I work (from home) without having to sit with a gun on all time.

We were adjusting the legs of my desk to lower it since I've been having some back problems and he was giving me a hand.  I totally forgot that my gun could fall out if you bang around on that desk hard enough and so I didn't even think about.  While we were setting the desk back in place it sure enough fell out onto the desk.

He said ""whoa what was tha....."" and looked at me a little funny.  I just said ""That's my .45"" and grinned a little.  I felt terrible but he seemed a little bit intrigued actually because he knows me pretty well.

Of course his next question was ""is it loaded?"" to which I responded ""Oh yeah.  Always.""  

I asked if he wanted to see it and he did not.  I just completely dropped it there and apologized because I felt terrible.  After putting all my stuff back on the desk I unloaded it and left it on the desk with the slide racked and let him know he could look at it whenever he wanted.  He went in and seemed to be really intrigued by not only the gun but the fact that I had one loaded all the time.

I explained a few things and later that evening he actually said ""I want a gun now"".

It's amazing what a little knowledge and experience can do for someone.

I just wanted to share.  Sorry for the novel.

The firearm I plan to be carrying will be roughly the size of a Glock 19 for those wondering. I know shoulder holsters often get shit on unless you are an extra in a TV crime drama, but based off of my research thus far, they seem like a great option for me.

- I am tall and slim (6'2"" 165) and tend to wear tailored, slim fitting clothing, especially for trousers. My shirts/jackets are almost all either pretty short (ending barely past my beltline) or are tucked in, which discourages me from getting a holster located on my waist. The only time I have outerwear that is long enough to my rear end is when I am wearing a suit jacket, sports coat, or an actual foul weather coat. It seems that OWB holsters would almost always be visible, and that IWB holsters would not pair well with my clothing choices either. However, I am almost always wearing an unbuttoned outer layer (often pretty short in length, like a classic [levis trucker jacket](http://images.askmen.com/fashion/apparel/1248984763_levis-trucker-jacket_1.jpg)) that would be able to easily conceal a shoulder holster.

- For my career, I spend a large amount of time sitting down in vehicles. I've read that shoulder holsters are generally easier to access than other types of holsters while seated, with a seatbelt, etc.

- Most importantly, I want to walk around naked in my house wearing a shoulder holster.

But seriously. Is my thought process correct here? I don't really have much interest in an ankle holster or anything else semi-unusual. Let me know what y'all think.

Edit: Thanks for all the feedback so far. Some points that people have brought up include:

- Retention problems with others having access to your weapon

- Not being able to draw at the range

- Not as secure, more ""floppy"" than more fixed holster types

- You can mount a holster in the vehicle when driving if necessary

- Anything shoulder holsters can do, waistband can probably do better

My initial reaction was that this was not okay but as I read through the comments the overwhelming majority seemed to be in favor of being allowed to drink as much as one wants while carrying. I didn't comment on the post and my silence has been bugging me so I'm going to rectify that situation now.

While I see no reason why someone legally allowed to conceal carry should not be allowed to be in bar, I find it wholly irresponsible for someone carrying a firearm to also be drinking anywhere. Alcohol impedes a person’s judgment, judgment which is critical when deciding whether or not lethal force is merited and how to go about executing a proper defense that will best minimize the risk to innocent bystanders. These are incredibly difficult judgment calls to make while sober and alcohol is not going to improve the situation. 

This is not a decision that will only affect the carrier, it affects the person on the other end of the firearm, it affects that person's family, it affects the carrier's family, and it affects everyone within range of the carrier's weapon.

Am I off base with this opinion?

I am an average size guy, not imposing, but certainly not what you would consider a target.  I live in a nice area with a fairly low crime rate.  I currently have my right arm in a sling, but it isn't hurt too bad.  I am really just kind of giving it longer to heal than it probably needs.  
Today:
I am going out to lunch.  I am carrying on my right hip (the sling actually doesn't hinder drawing or aiming very much at all).  I get out of the truck and as I am closing the car door I spot a large man on the other side of this small parking lot.  He sees me and immediately makes a beeline for me.  Like I said, I am an average size guy (6 foot, 190lbs), and this guy is HUGE.  I won't bother to estimate his size because in the heat of the moment I probably saw him twice as large as he was.
Anyway, here is this Sasquatch of a man coming at me.  He's not running, but he is moving with intent, leaning into his walk.  I move my shirt a little to the side, and make sure I can get to my pistol without a problem.  At the same time I yell(maybe scream.  I was terrified) at him.  I believe my exact words were ""wrong guy, motherfucker"". He makes about a 40 degree turn and keeps going, mumbling angrily.

I went with the [Alien Gear Holster](https://aliengearholsters.com/).

From the first visit to the website, I was sucked in. From the 30 day trial, 'free' ( pay shipping) trades, and warranty.

I chose Alien, primarily for the 30 trial, just to try it out. Most of the others, had no return/trial period.

Others were over $50. Alien started at around $36 (shipping). More if you wanted black leather. But they have a store also on eBay.

Not to mention the wait times. Some online were at 2 weeks, others at 2 months. Ordered mine Thursday afternoon. I got it Monday.

Quality. It's great...for $36. But I also wasn't expecting perfection for that price. The Kydex is very nice, and the leather is quite thick. It started to irritate my skin a little, but it is to be expected with virgin leather. I was worried the night before more of the grips on my G19 Gen4 rubbing onto me. But that rarely happened. The only thing I hate about it, is the extra spacers they give you. They SUCK. They should either give you color coded spacers, or a length of tube and a razor blade so you can cut to it length. Many of mine were at different sizes.

Concealment is very nice. No real problems from it. The grip in the holster for me is nice and snug. You can adjust it to your liking, with the crappy spacers.

I plan on knocking out, or flattening the bottom holder for the belt loop. I don't plan on having it that high up on me. And it tugs on my pants to remove the holster.

Overall, I like it. And I'll probably buy another for a different gun.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,1375297483.0,,,True,t3_1jff4x,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1jff4x/followup_from_holster_for_ccw_while_landscaping/,

 I've found myself at a personal dilemma as to when it would be appropriate or not to carry. Keep in mind I live in PA, so there are no restrictions for me to carry when I am in a bar or intoxicated. I understand mixing firearms and alcohol is never a good idea, that is a no brainer. But then another part of me feels that, even if I was slightly intoxicated, if shit hit the fan, I would rather have the choice to defend myself, drunk or not.  I feel like it is okay to carry when I am going to be driving, staying under the legal limit. I also have chosen not to carry on ""nights out"" when I know I am going to be getting shit faced, partying hard. The dilemma is the middle ground, tonight for example, I am going out with some friends to watch the basketball game. I'll probably have too much to drink to drive (I'm getting a ride) but I have work tomorrow so I won't be reckless. Clearly based on this ramble, I could use some of your guys' opinions.

She has always been progun, but was attending a state college and hanging around a bunch of hippies. Buying a gun herself never crossed her mind until one day, something changed.

She worked on the weekends as a leasing agent in a nice apartment complex, and a man came in who she found very creepy. He wasn't the kind of guy that annoys a girl and makes her blush by flirting, he was the kind of guy who raised red flags and caused fear. During the course of their conversation, she made eye contact with a maintenance man who figured out she was scared, who got one of the resident police officers. That officer came in and waited as though he was in line. My now-wife thanks him, and they thought everything was fine.

Until the next weekend, the guy came in and said, angrily, ""Where were you this week? I checked every day and you weren't here!"" No one in the office during the week had seen him, so it was obvious the guy was doing very discreet recon, and that he is the kind of person that for me goes immediately into ""potential threat mode.""

I was on a plane out of here that night with several declared firearms. She could not immediately buy a handgun in NC due to the waiting period, and her sheriff would not rush a permit for her even with a filed police report.

I spent the next day training her how to safely and effectively use a handgun, the basics of home defense theory, and then enrolling her in more advanced classes. I left her with several guns.

Which brings me to why I oppose universal background checks and the current regulations on transporting handguns across state lines: right now, my wife is prepared to defend herself. She has her carry permit. At that time, she was not prepared, and she found herself with a guy who was behaving like a stalker. Universal background checks, even with family waivers, would have made me giving her a gun illegal. Had I wanted to give her a handgun, it would have been illegal under *current Federal Law.* The whole thing is bogus.

Oh, the property ended up getting a no trespass order issued against the guy, and after my wife moved up North to work on her masters, the property owner mentioned he found out the guy had been arrested for some type of assault shortly after the no trespass - an assault against a woman. My wife didn't ask more, so I don't know if that was a pseudonym for rape, robbery, or what.

If universal confiscation never came, I would oppose universal background checks because they create victims out of people who need to quickly go from ""unprepared"" to ""preparing.""",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_1a23f6,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1a23f6/why_i_oppose_universal_background_checks_and/,

I met with her, the executive director and H.R. today to clarify everything. It is now on record with H.R. The company officially has no written or formal policy regarding 624.714 subdivision 17. They can not intimidate or harass me in regards to a law I'm not violating, that they do not enforce, that they did not even know existed. **They did not even know 624.714 existed. They can't get mad.**

My supervisor apologized profusely and explained it was a personal and not a professional conversation.  *H.R. and the director were not pleased.*  It is now on record, it is now understood that as per our original agreement it will not be an issue personally or professionally. They know I was not doing anything wrong and the unprofessional outburst is now on record.

I made it abundantly clear that if it does become an issue I will be out of there faster than they can say ""black rifle"".

 Now I know it is not perfect but it works. I left a little too much room in the pocket and didn't have a perfect design.

# **Five Rules for Concealed Carry**

**1\.  YOUR CONCEALED HANDGUN IS FOR PROTECTION OF LIFE ONLY.** Draw it solely in preparation to protect yourself or an innocent third party from the wrongful and life-threatening criminal actions of another.

**2\.  KNOW EXACTLY WHEN YOU CAN USE YOUR GUN.** A criminal adversary must have, or reasonably appear to have:

&gt; A) The ability to inflict serious bodily injury (he is armed or reasonably appears to be armed with a deadly weapon),

&gt; B) The opportunity to inflict serious bodily harm (he is physically positioned to harm you with his weapon), and

&gt; C) His intent (hostile actions or words) indicates that he means to place you in jeopardy -- to do you serious or fatal physical harm.

When all three of these attack potential elements are in place simultaneously, then you are facing a reasonably perceived deadly threat that justifies an emergency deadly force response.

**3\.  IF YOU CAN RUN AWAY -- RUN!** Just because you’re armed doesn’t necessarily mean you must confront a bad guy at gunpoint. Develop your ""situation awareness"" skills so you can be alert to detect and avoid trouble altogether. Keep in mind that if you successfully evade a potential confrontation, the single negative consequence involved might be your bruised ego, which should heal with mature rationalization. But if you force a confrontation you risk the possibility of you or a family member being killed or suffering lifelong crippling/disfiguring physical injury, criminal liability and/or financial ruin from civil lawsuit. Flee if you can, fight only as a last resort.

**4\.  DISPLAY YOUR GUN, GO TO JAIL.** Expect to be arrested by police at gunpoint, and be charged with a crime anytime your concealed handgun is seen by another citizen in public, regardless of how unintentional or innocent or justified the situation might seem. Choose a method of carry that reliably keeps your gun hidden from public view at all times.

You have no control over how a stranger will react to seeing (or learning about) your concealed handgun. He or she might become alarmed and report you to police as ""a man or woman with a gun."" Depending on his or her feelings about firearms, this person might be willing to maliciously embellish his or her story in attempt to have your gun seized by police or to get you arrested. An alarmed citizen who reports a ""man with a gun"" is going to be more credible to police than you when you're stopped because you match the suspect's description, and you are found to have a concealed handgun in your possession.

Before you expose your gun in public, ask yourself: ""Is this worth going to jail for?"" The only time this question should warrant a ""yes"" response is when an adversary has at least, both ability and intent, and is actively seeking the opportunity to do you great harm.

**5\.  DON’T LET YOUR EMOTIONS GET THE BEST OF YOU.** If, despite your best efforts to the contrary, you do get into some kind of heated dispute with another person while you’re armed, never mention, imply or exhibit your gun for the purpose of intimidation or one-upmanship. You’ll simply make a bad situation worse -- for yourself (see rule #4).",,False,,t5_2s4mc,True,,,True,t3_t1pxy,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/t1pxy/came_across_this_list_via_link_on_rguns_of/,
1333509583.0,34,self.CCW,rsb2k,My incident from this weekend. Please help me analyze it. ,cabrilo,44,10,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/rsb2k/my_incident_from_this_weekend_please_help_me/,"This weekend I took my 3 year old son to visit his aunt and cousin in California. Guess what I could not take along. 

On Saturday after lunch we were walking around the neighborhood with the kids. She lives in a great neighborhood (Burlingame - just outside of San Francisco). We were just about done with the walk and my sister and her kid walked into the house. My son was poking some mud with a stick and I was in no hurry so I was just watching him. 

All of a sudden I see a young white guy in a corner of my eye and he does not belong around. His head is shaved he is wearing shorts and t-shirt (it was cold and rainy) and the shorts was basically around his ankles. He is walking literally in the middle of the road (not much traffic at all) and he has a dog that is running off leash on the sidewalk. I then notice that the dog is a giant pit bull with a chain consisting of 3 huge links. The dog sprints for my son. My first instinct is to lift my son up, which I do. My son is not afraid of dogs at all, and is calm about it. The dog stops about 10 yards from us and is sniffing something. It now hits me that you are not supposed to lift the kids because that gets their attention. So I put my son down - despite all of my instincts and position myself between the dog and my son. The dog gets done sniffing and makes another run for my son. I grab the link and the dog is now almost in my son's face. I feel for a second how ridiculously strong this dog is, and my mind is going full speed on how to stop him. The best I came up in the moment is to lift the dog by the chain. A moment before I was to do this the dog takes off in other direction. 

At this point the owner is walking past me with a gangster swagger. I yell out ""what the fuck"" and try to make an eye contact with him. He looks into the sky the whole time and while holding a leash across his neck he flips me two birds while slowly walking by. 

First of all - fuck carry restrictions and irresponsible pit bull owners. 

If we were at home I feel confident that I would have drawn at the dog. I probably would have held it on his head and waited to see what he does. But I think I should have just shot the dog. Had I waited and he attacked it would be hard to shot him without hitting my son.

I have a fit 75 lb dog, and my sister has a lean 100 lb dog. This thing was smaller but felt stronger then both of them combined. 

30 minutes later the adrenaline wore off and I tried to debrief myself. I am still not sure how I would have reacted if I had my carry weapon on me. 

Please tell me: Am I overreacting, did I underact? What do you think. What would you have done with and without your weapon.   ",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_rsb2k,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/rsb2k/my_incident_from_this_weekend_please_help_me/,

This means you can't just park and leave your gun in the car - according the USPS, that would still constitute a Federal crime.

1375728705.0,38,self.CCW,1jr9bi,Old Faithful vs. Crossbreed (an initial impression.),mfacenet,45,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1jr9bi/old_faithful_vs_crossbreed_an_initial_impression/,"So I ordered a Crossbreed holster for my Walther P99 a few months ago and got it today.  Since when I ordered my Crossbreed I also ordered a Old Faithful for my Glock 21 which arrived two weeks after I ordered it.  I wanted to share some initial impressions and points to any of you looking at which of these two holster companies to go with.  First of, ignore the shipping time differences, now that things are calming down Crossbreed is catching up, at some point their shipping will be as fast as Old Faithful.  

Some considerations about my order:

* I ordered the Crossbreed in Horsehide and the Old Faithful didn't have that option, this may explain some of the differences in thickness.
* My Old Faithful came shaped, just not assembled.
* I've worn the Old Faithful for three weeks now, the Crossbreed just arrived today.

Now on to the fun stuff:

On leather:

Old Faithful is significantly thicker than Crossbreed, almost doubly as thick.  Again, my Crossbreed is horsehide, so that may account for some of the thickness difference.  It's also worth noting that Old Faithful gives you a larger leather area around the weapon.

On Kydex:

Old Faithful covers from the barrel up to above the trigger, no metal is exposed except at the barrel opening.  Crossbreed has my front sight exposed to snag on clothing, the kydex itself, etc.

On Clips:

The Crossbreed clips are fantastic, I have both the traditional metal loops and the jclips both are fantastic.  The metal clips on the Old Faithful have a lot of tension and I had to dull the edges a bit. 

On Hardware:

Crossbreed rivets the Kydex to the leather, uses larger retention nuts on the straps themselves and due to my assembly with Old Faithful, the Crossbreed does not allow me to ""feel"" the hardware. 

On Gun Retention:

Crossbreed is not adjustable, at least not easily.  Their recommendation?  Heat the Kydex with a hairdryer to allow it flow a bit more into the trigger area of the gun.  Old Faithful provides what is basically air hose cut to certain lengths and various length screws to allow you to adjust retention on the holster.

[Image Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/0G2NJ) showing what I'm saying above.

My personal opinion:

Both are excellent holsters, however, I like the additional kydex and leather Old Faithful provides.  I also love Crossbreeds clips so what I think I'm going to do in the future is purchase Old Faithful holsters and replace their clips with clips from Crossbreed.  Ultimately though, this is all about personal preference, use what works, what you feel comfortable with.

I'll follow up once I've broken the Crossbreed in to report on comfort.  Keep calm and carry on.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_1jr9bi,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1jr9bi/old_faithful_vs_crossbreed_an_initial_impression/,

Found himself outgunned by fourteen year olds with better equipment and more experience. Decided it felt too much like LARPING. Won't be going back.

Disclaimer: This was my first and only visit to an Airsoft arena. My experience may be very different from yours. I'm only writing this to give you my perspective (and to soothe my bruised ego). Since I'm an ex-military CCWer who takes weapons very, very seriously, I thought my experience might be useful to others like me.

This past weekend I visited the [SAS Black Ops](http://www.sasblackops.com/) arena in Marietta, Georgia (Atlanta area). There were six of us in the city for a bachelor party and Airsoft sounded like a fun idea.

After eating a late breakfast at the Cracker Barrel (Grandma's Sampler, yeah!), we arrived a little before lunchtime. I had a sense we were in trouble when I walked in the door and saw the entire staff was decked out in tactical gear; we were mostly in jeans and casual shirts. Full alarm bells went off when I saw the waiting room: a dozen teenagers (ages 11-17?) in full camo, some with body armor, were waiting for the next match. Most of the kids had custom goggles and masks, flashlights, and backup weapons. Shit.

While we drew our weapons, magazines, and masks from the armory, I noted a few things about the other customers. First, muzzle sweep was rampant; even the armorer would casually point weapons in the general direction of the customers and pull the trigger to test the motor's action. Granted, the weapon had a sock over the muzzle, but...

Second, there was no trigger discipline. In the few minutes we waited for the next match to start, I think I developed a nervous tick in my right eye, watching everyone (my friends included) walk around with their finger on the trigger, sweeping everyone in the room.

Lastly, all the noobs (myself included) had to watch a five minute video explaining the rules and how to get thrown out. It was a challenge hearing the audio (that could just be me and my crappy hearing) and the video seemed to skip forwards at some points, so I'm certain I missed a few things (more on that later).

When we moved to the ""briefing room"" to get ready for a match, they gave us a cursory briefing, divided the group into two teams, and explained the rules of the game. The Yellow Team wore a yellow scarf to differentiate themselves. We started off with a deathmatch where you're allowed to respawn twice; upon your third ""death"" you had to return to the team's respawn point and wait for the match to end. Subsequent games involved capturing flags, raising flags, finding a detonator for a nuke, etc.

Upon entering the arena, which was in a massive warehouse, I took note of the various buildings they had set up. Most buildings were about 6'x8'; they usually had two doors and a window, pretty much eliminating the possibility for finding a truly defensible position. The building were never more than ten or fifteen feet apart, though there were some sight lines (streets, alleys) than ran for 50 feet or more. There was a scale model of the arena in the building's lobby, but I didn't have the time to memorize it.

Each team went to their designated building at opposite corners of the arena, with each team having a designated respawn point in one of the other two corners.

I should point out that the arena was very well-lit. However, I had never visited the website, so I was a bit surprised when the match started and the lights went out. Some music or sound effects (I don't recall which) started up and made hearing anything practically impossible. Then a bunch of spotlights came on, strategically placed to blind people looking around some corners and to cast long shadows around others. You see, this 27,000 sq ft arena ""specializes in simulated Night Ops.""

So, here I was in a dark arena, effectively deaf, surrounded by teenagers who knew the layout better than I did, were better equipped, and had actually done this before. Double shit.

Everyone took off in different directions, so I decided to play it safe and find a defensible position and stay alive. The first thing I realized was that there was no way to use the sights on the MP5-style weapon I had been given. The sights were too low and the mask too big. I decided to rely on instinct shooting, which I'm pretty decent at if my number of kills in the arena is any indication.

About thirty seconds later I took my first hit, right in the belly. Gut shot! Strangely enough, that was to only hit to leave a mark (and I got hit a lot more). It hurt for a few minutes and I'll probably still have the bruise next week.

I moved back to our building and ""respawned."" A couple of minutes later I was creeping through a building when a kid jumps through the doorway and yells ""Surrender!"" Honestly, he startled me so bad I didn't actually react consciously; I acted on instinct. I shot him.

Now, I should point out that you're not supposed to shoot anyone closer than 10 feet. I knew this. Sort of. Also, the deathmatch was semi-automatic only. However, the rental gun I was using had no real *snap* to the fire selector, so it moved easily from semi to automatic. So... I guess I shot him about three or four or five times. From a distance of about three feet. We got chewed out by the range officer at the next briefing. It turns out I wasn't the only one to do something like that.

I ended up being the last guy out on our team, thanks to my defensive attitude and tactics. In other words, I found a dark alley near the edge of the arena, hid, and waited for someone to come along that I could ambush. It didn't take long for some kamikaze kids to take me out. Which brings me to my biggest gripe about the whole outing...

My overall impression of the experience is that it's designed to be a LARPing version of Call of Duty. None of the kids seemed to care about getting shot; they just run off and respawn. There are no tactics. Lots of spray and pray. And people yelling ""Surrender!"" and ""Grenade!"" Sheesh! If I wanted to play a video game, I'd stay at home with my XBox.

I know it hurts to get shot up close. And I feel bad for the kid I lit up in the first round. But... It feels really stupid jumping through doorways and yelling ""Boo!"" at people to ""kill them."" I guess I'd rather play a game where everyone is expected to wear heavy clothes and there is no minimum range. It really takes you out of the experience.

So, bottom line. I was expecting an opportunity to engage in simulated weapons combat with people who thought getting shot was a bad thing and in an environment that had some relation to reality. What I experienced was some long-range shooting, getting yelled-to-death up close, and major sensory deprivation. I won't be going back.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the masks fogged up very easily and taking it off in the arena would get you thrown out. So the second half of most of the matches was spent trying to decide (through your blurry vision) if the guy in the distance is on your team or theirs. And you usually got shot before you could figure it out.

And another thing, lot's of the kids would shoot people on their own team. They'd say ""Sorry"" and run off. I lost count of the friendly fire incidents after five. That's just not right.

I mean, beyond just wearing clothes that help conceal. I tend to do so.  

I'm normally a jeans and t-shirt kind of guy, but when I carry (which at the moment is not often because I go to a college that prohibits firearms) I make a conscious effort to wear a different kind of clothing. I wear tasteful sweaters, nicer shirts, dressy glasses instead of my usual contacts etc. I look more like... I don't know how to say this without sounding dumb, more ""hipster and metro,"" like a bookish guy who's concerned with fashion (and probably the kind of person who would ""hate guns"" and not be caught dead with one).  

My rationale is that police or whoever else might hassle/fear someone lawfully carrying wouldn't expect a guy who looks like me to be a CCW holder. I'd get a lot less attention/profiling than a guy wearing a MOLON LABE shirt and a camo hat, and if I do happen to print or something, the cognitive dissonance will be such that they might not even recognize it. It's much harder to see (or think you saw) something you'd never expect.  

I'm not especially worried, since I never carry illegally or anything, and when you're permitted in my state it makes no difference whether you're concealed or OC. I mostly just don't like confrontation in general and especially don't want to be confronted/have to interact with police when the situation involves my firearms.

As I rounded the corner to put my equipment in my truck I noticed two women and a young girl (maybe 2 years old) trying to leave the house.  A young man comes out of the house with a baseball bat threatening to _____ them up if they leave.  I stood at my truck to witness what was going on, the young man never lifted the bat like he was going to swing which is when I had decided is when I would enter into this discussion.  Also if I got involved and assisted the women leave with the child I could be aiding them in something illegal.  

I knew that if I called the police that it would take a while for them to get there and since I was working for their family it might effect me completing my work and getting paid.

I felt that since I was carrying a firearm that I may have to employ deadly force if confronted by this young man.  By standing by and waiting to what happened I felt that I would not make the situation worse. I figured it I got involved the young man might threaten me with the bat.

In the end the women and child left and the young man when inside.  

I keep playing the event over and over in my mind if what I did was proper or should I have done something else.  My thoughts at the time were that if he held the bat like he was going to hit someone I would yell and get his attention and try and persuade him to put down the bat, preferably without me having to present my firearm.

Weapons include, but are not limited to, any implement that may cause bodily harm to another individual if directed at them such as firearms, archery equipment, knives, lances, etc.  This policy applies regardless of whether or not the employee or any person with the employee has a legal permit to carry a weapon.""

My question to all of you is this; have any of you cpl licensees had any luck changing your employers stance on weapons in the workplace for those that are legally allowed to carry?  I am trying to figure out if it is wise to try and discuss this with the man upstairs and how to approach it.

No big deal, I do it all the time. 0445 rolls around and I goto get started nice and early and as I am parking my car I notice there is a pickup truck on the side of the place with out of state plates, lights on, and a large man inside. I curiously glance at it, make note of it, and continue to go about parking my car. The fellow gets out of his vehicle as I am exiting mine. I initiate an interaction in an effort to A) let him know I know he's there, and B) potentially pacify him. ""Hey buddy, good morning! We aren't open for another half hour or so"". He didn't respond.


I go about my normal routine. Kill the alarm, turn on the grills and fryer, get the bacon and eggs out of the freezer, turn on all the vent fans (noisy as fuck) to pull off the stagnant hot air from the evening prior, yada yada - when I hear a knocking at the back door.

Now I made a point to shut the gate to the backyard, and the other guy who was working the morning with me wasn't showing up until 0630 or so, so I knew this could be trouble. My uncle, who owns/owned the place was robbed twice, once at gunpoint right in the front of the store during the evening, and once in the early morning after superbowl sunday when he was opening. The guys came to the back door and when he opened it they smashed his face with a baseball bat a few times, ran in and pulled the register and grabbed a bunch of cigarettes.

Knowing this story intimately, I was afraid of the latter being the case right now.


I turn on a few of the lights and make sure the camera feeds are getting a decent picture, and kill the blower so I can ask ""who is it?"" I look through the window on that side of the building and see its that large fellow from the truck. ""Exterminator"" he says. I'm confused because no one told me anything about an exterminator, and we didn't open for at least another half hour.

He did had a uniform, spray tank of some sort, and seemed legit, but I know how these things could go down, so I ask him if he's got a work ID or something to verify. He tells me he comes here all the time in the morning for the owner (who he mentioned by name - though that wouldn't be hard to discern if you lived in/near the neighborhood)



I tell him I'm going to open the door, but to just have his ID badge out so I can see it, and I reluctantly opened the door with my right hand on my glock. I half expected to have my face bashed in with a bat or crowbar when I opened the door, but was fortunate to be greeted just by the exterminator.

I told him to come in, apologized for being a bit jumpy in the morning, and offered him a cup of coffee.

It took him a second, but he realized my hand was on my carry piece after I pulled my boars head polo back down over it.


I called the owner about it the other day, and he apologized for not letting me know that was going on. He then chuckled and reminisced about how when he would come in the AM when he was opening up the exterminator would always be like ""don't shoot! its just me!"" and it was a running joke that I am now a part of.

I was clearly compliant, offering understanding of his demand, but also questioning if the store manager was available for me to speak with. He was quite short with me when he advised that I must leave immediately and secure the firearm in my vehicle and I was unable to speak to the store manager until I do so. With continued compliance, yet hesitation, I suggested an unattended firearm in a vehicle would be rather unsafe and asked if I could cover it while I remain in the store. No, of course, was Jerry's answer. I secured it in the car and came back inside.

Jerry was, in my opinion, an obnoxious old man who for all I care could pound sand until he falls asleep each night. He followed me out of the store as if he caught me vandalizing property, and according to my wife, he made her feel ""like a criminal"".

I met with the store manager (Chris) upon arriving inside, and went into his private office along with Jerry. He was a much more calm, easygoing gentleman. Chris opened the floor to me and I asked if this is a corporation wide policy, he confirmed it is. I questioned when this became effective and he answered ""about six months ago"". He stated something to the effect of how Giant Food Stores wants their customers to feel safe and this is why the corporate decision was made to prohibit firearms (unless you're law enforcement ). It was clear this was not his personal decision, but he was my current point of contact with the company and I asked if I could provide some feedback about what he's told me.

-There aren't many, if any, mass shootings in places that allow firearms. Forcing people to lose their means of self preservation and self defense will undoubtedly make them feel unsafe.  
-I have been shopping with Giant for over a decade, I lived in that town before Giant was built there. This was the first time any store employee has discussed this with me.  
-Firearm owners don't always agree on everything, but if there is one thing we do, it's voting with our money. Patronizing stores that have this stance is not commonplace, and I'd personally be voting with my money (or lack thereof) by abandoning the cart full of groceries that I'd already accumulated.  
-The events I experienced will most certainly be shared with my fellow firearm owners.

Chris didn't mind if I abandoned the groceries and he seemed like a stand up guy. He mentioned that he's a firearm owner himself, however we know that his personal opinions and corporate's decisions are not mutually exclusive.

I concluded my business with Chris, got his card and bid him farewell. My wife was standing near the other entrance of the store so I walked across and met her there. She gave me the ol' ""what's the verdict?"" look and I shook my head. At this point we're in a closer quarters private discussion range and she tells me ""Well, I'm not buying this stuff then."". Highlight of my day. My wife, historically (from 1999-2012) as anti as they come, refusing to pay for groceries because of Giant's policy. Warmed my heart.

I didn't record the discussion and I didn't want to quote anybody inaccurately, thus more of a story format than a dialog format. If you made it this far thank you for reading it. I'm open to suggestions/feedback, and I've heard that Giant doesn't allow firearms before from various people but never their employees or official documentation on their storefront or website. I'll be reaching out to corporate to give them my feedback on the matter...however futile that may be.",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_1kdqae,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1kdqae/my_first_negative_encounter_while_ocing_note_its/,

Do any of you carry a trauma kit as an EDC item, especially a pocket trauma kit?  Or are you considering getting one?  If you have a situation where you might need to draw, there's a chance of being shot or stabbed or needing to immediately treat someone else who is shot or stabbed.

If you carry one,

* which one, or if you put it together yourself, what's in it?
* what sort of training did you get on using it?

If you considered carrying one but decided against it, why not?

* Was it liability?  Or that you didn't think it would be needed given your circumstances (fast LE or EMT response time)?

Do any of you carry a decompression needle?  If so, what training did you get for that?  If you are a medical professional and carry it, would you recommend a non-medical professional carry one, with the proper training of course?  Some people seems to have the opinion that even if they wouldn't use it themselves, they are betting that a bystander with the proper training could use it in case the bystander isn't carrying one themselves (i.e. they are off duty but don't carry one).

**Background**

There's a lot of history with such kits in the military and those who serve domestically (law enforcement, emergency medical, etc.).  One common military term for such kits is IFAK - individual first aid kit.  A common slang term for these kits is ""blow out kit.""  There's even a standards body called TCCC providing guidelines for kits that treat the top causes of preventable combat deaths:

* 60%: extremity hemorrhaging
* 33%: tension pneumothorax
* 6: airway obstruction

Such kits are labeled as ""TCCC Compliant.""

See

* [Developing A Blow Out Kit](http://www.itstactical.com/medcom/medical/developing-a-blow-out-kit/)
* [2010 TCCC Tactical Combat Casualty Care Guidelines](http://www.itstactical.com/medcom/tccc-medcom/2010-tccc-tactical-combat-casualty-care-guidelines/)
* [Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC)](http://www.narescue.com/Tactical_Combat_Casualty_Care_%28TCCC%29-CN1CBE802C690C.html) (caution: graphic images of injuries)
* [TCCC for the Police Officer](http://www.officersurvival.org/blogs/news/6143386-tccc-for-the-police-officer-police-news)

As is often the case, these things follow a pattern: developed by the military and then makes its way to law enforcement / emergency medical and concealed carriers.

**Kit Components**

What follows seems to be the essential components of a pocket trauma kit (treat extremity hemorrhaging and possibly tension pneumothorax with makeshift occlusive dressing using plastic packaging):

* tourniquet - SWAT-Tourniquet seems perfect for this purpose
* hemostatic agent - QuikClot or CELOX Z-Fold Gauze
* pressure bandage - 4"" Israeli Bandage seems to be the go-to pressure bandage
* good quality nitrile gloves
* some kind of blade to serve as trauma shears - pocket knives with rescue features such as [Benchmade 915 Traige](http://www.benchmade.com/products/915) or a dedicated safety cutter tool such as [Benchmade 7 Safety Cutter](http://www.benchmade.com/products/7)

**Example Kits**

There are pocket trauma kits on the market, but some of these are pretty expensive.  Example pocket kits:

* [ITS EDC Trauma Kit](http://www.itstactical.com/store/edc/its-edc-trauma-kit/)
* [Pocket D.A.R.K.](http://darkangelmedical.com/About.php)

",biglazymoose,36,4,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/s8m2j/family_issues_with_ccw_need_advice/,"Hey all. 
I have applied for my ccw permit in Boulder County and am currently a month or so into the 90 day waiting period. I'm 21 in college(taking a semester off) and I work full-time for a non-profit org. I'm a pretty liberal guy.

Everyone I love who is important to me (brothers, parents) is against me carrying a weapon. They don't mind me owning firearms(although parents are strongly anti-gun), they just think it's a bad idea to carry one on me. They ask me when/where would I ever be put into a situation where I would need one. I tell them I don't want to use it, but it's there just in case(I used the seatbelt analogy.) I also explained that I am above petty confrontations, and It is only there for life or death situations. I am a responsible gun owner and feel completely safe when I carry the means to protect my life from
whatever threats I hope don't happen but are possible. I don't live in a dangerous place.

They still think its a terrible idea and that only bad things can happen when I carry. It has gotten to a point where my mom is practically clinically depressed because she is worried about me. My older brother, the smartest guy I know, says ccw is just a bad idea. I love my family, and their opinions matter to me more than anybody else's.  

I honestly don't know what to do. This much opposition to my right to ccw is really bothering me. These are the people that can change my mind, but havent yet. Obviously I am talking to a biased crowd, but I need advice.

Thanks for listening and I look forward to your responses.

Edit: I live with friends in Boulder. I am pretty much on my own.

I was adjusting things before I headed out the door and my mom **flipped her shit** (I'm 24, living at home while my divorce clears). She insisted I was going to get arrested for having a gun in public. I showed her my permit and explained what locations are off limits.

I bought it a couple of weeks ago.  I've had my concealed carry permit for a while and have held off on buying a carry gun.  

I have a full size pistol that I kept in the truck.  I always told myself I would carry it if I ever needed it.  Stupid of course.  I found myself in a situation outside a pawnshop in a shitty part of Tampa, FL that would have made me a lot more comfortable had I not disregarded my instincts to carry for worries about comfort and printing with my large gun.

I wanted to get a Glock 26 for the cheap ammo and reliability but I couldn't see myself realistically carrying even that small of a gun.  I ended up settling on the LCP with a pocket holster.  Problem solved.  I can slip it into my front pocket on the way out the door just like it's a cell phone or wallet.  It's actually thinner than my wallet, which really means I need to clean that out.  

I carried with an empty chamber for a couple of days just to get the feel of the gun, now I keep one in the pipe.  You've really screwed up somehow if you manage to accidentally drag that trigger all the way back.

Surprisingly accurate to.  I made a helluva lot of 3-4"" groups at 7 yards drawing and firing in at a self defense kind of speed.  2-3"" at a more reasonable pace.  The web of my hand did get a little tender after a box of 50 though.  

Anyone that's looking for a simple and inexpensive carry gun would do well to stick this one on their list.  No, it doesn't have the a 15 rd capacity, you won't ding steel targets at 50 yards with it, and it won't stop a charging grizzly with it's .380.  It is sitting right there in my pocket when it's needed though, while my full size is probably still stuck in my truck.

It's .40SW, but that works out because I have a full size M&amp;P 40. 

To those of you who have carried a Shield for awhile, I have some questions. 

What holster do you use and in what position? 

Do you have night sights? (I really enjoy having them on a carry weapon so they're one of my must have items) 

Do you use a laser? 

Do you use the manual safety or leave it in the off position? (I think the safety is a little too small to easily deactivate under duress and I have a disciplined trigger finger so I'd rather just not have the safety)

Here's a message he sent to remind people to aware of your surroundings.,idolon,53,22,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/xua9b/my_father_was_recently_a_victim_of_a_random_act/,"My father was recently assaulted while he was out. I'll let his message tell the story.

&gt;First of all, this is not a joke but a serious informational message about what I personally experienced late Friday evening August 3rd.
&gt;
&gt;On occasion, I walk to a local bar in St Peters that is fairly close to my house and have a beer for a night cap and to shoot the shit with the locals.  
&gt;Last night, I sat down at the bar (about 11:30PM) and got a beer. 
&gt;I was sitting next to a buddy and watching some Olympic reruns.
&gt;There were a total of 10 people in the tavern (8 men and 2 women), and I knew the first names of most of them.
&gt;
&gt;A black guy (young - about 20 or so) walked in and sat down about 15 feet away by himself at a table.
&gt;I didn't think anything of it.
&gt;I live in a safe neighborhood and only read about shit that happens in unsafe cities.
&gt;I turned my eyes back to the TV and continued watching a 15 year old American girl swimmer kick ass.
&gt;
&gt;The waitress asked the black guy what he wanted to drink.
&gt;He replied something (I didn't hear what he said).
&gt;The waitress asked for an ID.
&gt;He said he didn't have one.
&gt;He walked up to the bar right beside me and told the waitress he would give his birth date.
&gt;Again the waitress asked for an ID.
&gt;
&gt;Now keep in mind that I wasn't watching him.  
&gt;I was watching TV. 
&gt;I am in a safe neighborhood.
&gt;I could give a crap less that the guy didn't have an ID.
&gt;
&gt;Big Fucking Mistake.
&gt;
&gt;Next thing I know, I feel a wicked punch to my jaw and my body bounce against my friend that I was sitting beside.
&gt;
&gt;I immediately got up and saw the black fucking asshole running out the front door.
&gt;I got up and chased after him (everyone else in the bar was sort of in a WTF just happened mode).
&gt;Once I got to the door (dude, I wasn't going to leave the fricken bar and chase him - I am not that nuts!), I saw him about 150 feet away hauling ass.
&gt;I screamed every racial slur I could think of to lure him back in the bar (the seven other guys are quite large - one even played for Iowa State)
&gt;He turned to look at me but continued to run off. Chicken shit.
&gt;
&gt;Cops were called (three cars were there in 2 minutes) and a police report made.
&gt;I couldn't identify him even if my life depended on it but three people in the bar gave very detailed descriptions.
&gt;Cops looked for him and came back empty handed.
&gt;(Confirms the basic role of a law enforcement officer as a ""crime historian"" and not as a ""crime preventer""...).
&gt;
&gt;Basically, I was a victim of what is formally called a ""Knockout Game"" or ""Pick-em out, knock-em out"".
&gt;(You can google ""knockout game""...)
&gt;
&gt;The intent is to hit an unsuspecting innocent person in the temple to knock them out.
&gt;Fortunately for me, he missed my temple and hit my jaw.
&gt;His ride was probably waiting up the street to take themselves back to hood-ville.
&gt;
&gt;**This periodically happens even in St. Charles county.**
&gt;**You just don't hear about it.**
&gt;**I am making sure you hear about it now.**
&gt;**It happened to me.**
&gt;**Spread the word.**
&gt;
&gt;I thought about this a lot this morning and it could have ended up a lot worse.
&gt;A hell of a lot worse considering what happened in Colorado a couple of weeks ago.
&gt;
&gt;No matter what kind of community you are in (safe or not), be aware of the people around you if you don't know them.
&gt;If anything doesn't seem right, it then really is not.
&gt;
&gt;Watch your back.

I will also try to keep an accurate time frame. So, I go out to get some food from a restaurant for my girlfriend. I was going to get food for myself from another place. I arrived and paid for the food for GF about 7:30 ish, left the restaurant, and proceeded on my way home.

I'm now on the highway, behind a few cars. I get into the left lane of the highway because the right lane ends. Also, I'm trying to hurry up so I passed a couple cars in the right lane and they were forced to get  behind me at the merging point. So, the last guy I passed up, was now behind me, and he put his brights on. I waved to him, just to signify, ""sorry."" 

He had an suv and I had a mid sized sedan, so I could not see a thing with his brights on. So i slow down to 35 in a 45, and there is a hospital zone coming up, so I slow to 25 in the 35. We advance a little further down the road and the vehicle in front of me has now come to a complete stop, puts the vehicle in park and just sits there. At the same time, suv guy comes up on side of my vehicle, and stops at the rear drivers side door. I know what's happened, cut the wheel, and flee the scene.

Suv guy zooms past me, runs me off the road. So I slam on the brakes and put the car back on the road. Suv guy stops his car in the road, gets out of the vehicle, almost gets hit by a car, and advances towards my vehicle. At this time, I accelerate towards the opposite shoulder, he runs over to my vehicle as I'm passing and slams his fist, foot, or palm, into the side of my vehicle. I'm not sure where he hit the car but I could not care less at this point. 

I then hit side roads, random lefts and rights, and call 911. I was advised to come to the station and talk with an officer. To which I did. And that's pretty much it.

I've never been that scared in my life, and I'm sure I've left out some details. I will fill in any spots if I have. And I do not own a firearm of any kind, but have been in the market for one the past few weeks.

""Opinions about CCW 9mm's""",Ax_not_Axe,37,2,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1723eh/update_and_thanks_opinions_about_ccw_9mms/,"Last Thursday I posted on here opinions about CCW 9mm's and got an overwhelming positive response. I wanted to THANK YOU GUYS for the advice. I read every one of your responses, probably twice, so that I could make an informed decision. I also read a ton of reviews online and watched numerous videos.

I literally spent most of the past few days handling and shooting different firearms. I handled almost every one of the 9 mm's on my list and also a bunch of 380's. I also shot 9mm's .40's, 45's .357 mag and a .44 mag. 

I ended up purchasing a Smith and Wesson Shield for $385. Awesome gun and I felt like an awesome price. I got it from a small town mom and pop dealer that I think I will now be purchasing all of my firearms from. They were so helpful and ended up staying late to get me my firearm. Here is the url to their website: http://barneyoutdooroutfitters.com

I will now give my impressions of the 9 mm's I handled:

Kahr CM9- Simple, easy to use and felt good in the hand. Not the prettiest girl in the show, but it felt sturdy. I liked the trigger pull and the basic design. I would have been OK with buying this gun, so it was #2 on my list.

Ruger LC9- Holy crap! People were not kidding when they said there are a lot of safeties on this gun! While I was holding it a guy said to me ""Well, if you ever forget the instructions for that gun you can always read it off the side."" It fit my hands well though and I liked how the slide worked. The trigger pull was away too long for my liking and that was what ultimately made me decide against this gun. This is my last choice because of that trigger alone. And that's saying a lot because this was the gun that I originally was set on buying before I handled them.

Smith and Wesson M&amp;P9 Shield- I love the intuitive design slim profile and large sights. As soon as I bought it I went to a range and put 25 rounds through it before cleaning or doing anything. It shot awesome and didn't have a single misfeed or malfunction. I could go on and on about it, but the biggest thing is the short trigger pull, large sights, and how it fit in my hand.

Taurus PT709 Slim- I also liked how this one felt in my hand, surprisingly more than the other guns other than the Shield. It had a descent trigger, a good slide and the sights were OK. I think you get what you pay for with this gun, but it appears that Taurus is on the right track. I think this was my #3 choice.

THANK YOU REDDIT! You have helped m,e to get a gun that will help protect my family and be fun to take out to the range. You guys are great!

What drills do you do in your daily practice to better hone your situational awareness skills?

I guess it's good to condition yourself to raise your awareness level when out and about (code yellow) entering a building, when entering or exiting your vehicle (code orange) etc. and then let it return to a lower level (code white) when sitting at a desk at work etc. 

Here are a few good links.

Tonight was my first night of carrying legally after working there for 7 months and carrying occasionally when the night was known to be rough. The run is .25 miles through the darkest part of downtown.

So tonight, carrying a glock 22 Appendix with a Raven Concealment Vanguard 2. 

A black male wearing grey sweatshirt and old blue jeans runs across the street screaming ""I´VE GOT A GUN, GUN GUN GUN"" as he grabs for his waistband and pulling on something. I took two steps back and put the valet box between myself and him and started the process of lifting up my shirt to draw on him, when I saw that all he brought out was his finger pointed like a gun and started laughing at everybody and trying to get a high five....and laughing that we would call the police on him. 

The security team knows I carry, as of tonight, and the door man is actually my Muay Thai trainer, but I am the only person armed outside on Friday and Saturday nights....and I hate to say it, but I am absolutely certain that I could have drawn, fired, and killed him. After years of training at indoor airsoft facilities (you can knock it but I know what I am capable of). That man is very very lucky that he did not pull out something like a fake gun, and I am very lucky that I did not assess the situation incorrectly and take his life.

I got ahold of some police officers while running the next car, and I watched him get put into a police car less than 3 minutes afterwards.

* Virginia allows anyone to O.C. inside a state park, and you can C.C. if you have a permit (I do, but plan to open carry as it is hot as shit outside and I have a full size M&amp;P)

* Virginia does not allow you to enter federal buildings (i.e. ranger stations) while armed

1370968296.0,27,self.CCW,1g4olm,Last night was the first time I truly wanted to be armed,swinebone,49,22,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1g4olm/last_night_was_the_first_time_i_truly_wanted_to/,"I have been wanting a handgun and a concealed carry permit for about a year, but my financial situation hasn't been in a place where it would have been a responsible decision. Nevertheless, I witnessed an altercation late last night and I felt woefully underprepared and useless.

I was walking out of a local grocery store with a female friend when we observed two vehicles pull up in the fire lane. The one in the rear was following very closely and bumped the one in the front. The hair on the back of my neck stood up and I knew that this was something more than your run-of-the-mill fender bender. Sure enough, as the leading vehicle stopped, the one in the rear accelerated again and rammed them.

Both drivers leapt out of their vehicles and began yelling at each other. The driver of the rear vehicle, a 20-something woman, squared up and was obviously looking for a fight. As soon as she got close enough, the male driver of the lead vehicle clocked her on the side of the head hard enough so that her head bounced off of his rear window.

All of this occurred within seconds and my friend and I were less than five feet away from them. Neither the woman or the man paid that much attention to us, but it wouldn't have taken much for us to somehow get involved. 

My friend can have a fiery temper and I knew that her instinct was to step in and try to protect the woman. As quickly as I could, I put myself between her and the incident, grabbed her arm, and walked with her towards my car. I felt exposed and unprotected in the open parking lot. As soon as we got into my car and I locked the doors we were on the line with 911.

I wouldn't have done anything differently if I would have been carrying, but I laid awake for most of the night thinking about the dozens of ways that we could have gotten involved. I'm a pretty big guy and feel relatively comfortable defending myself, but I wasn't dressed for a confrontation and the woman I was with didn't have my physical size or mental clarity. If we had gotten involved and I needed to defend myself or her, my only options were my fists or my EDC knife I was carrying. I knew neither were great options.

The man and the woman began to leave the area while we were on the line with 911 dispatch. I figure it had to be some sort of domestic dispute, as they ended up leaving in the same vehicle. I wouldn't be surprised if we weren't the only ones that called it in and it literally happened directly in front of a grocery store entrance, so I'm sure everything was caught on tape.

When we got back to her apartment, my friend and I talked about what had happened. She said that she felt like she should have stepped into the middle of the fight to protect the woman. I reiterated to her that what we did was the best thing that we could have done, especially considering we had no idea what was going on and if either of them had a weapon. I consider her impulse to be a benevolent one, but it scares me to think that she could have sacrificed her personal safety and stepped into the unknown like that if I hadn't had been there.

Even though my adrenaline has long since worn off, I still can't help but remember how defenseless I felt. I *hate* that feeling. I don't believe we were in imminent danger, but it was definitely a situation that could have escalated quickly out of control. I've known the friend that I was with for over eight years and I know that I wouldn't have hesitated to shoot someone to protect her or myself. That realization would have made me feel uneasy even two days ago, but now I honestly just feel resolved to not feel defenseless ever again.

I graduated graduate school in May and am currently looking for full-time employment, but I know that one of my first major purchases is going to be a CCW permit, a handgun, and a quality holster. I think I've considered it a passing fancy or a hobby for far too long.

EDIT: Will be picking up a CCW permit, a handgun, a quality holster, *and* some good training. Thanks for reminding me /u/BerntPickle.

**TL;DR--** A close friend and I were surprised by a physical fight outside of a grocery store last night. We weren't in imminent danger, but we were very close to it and so many things could have gone differently. I felt completely defenseless and while I wouldn't have done anything differently if I was carrying last night, I feel resolved to not feel like that again.

I'm looking into getting my conceal carry permit in the near future, but I don't really have a pistol I think appropriate for EDC. So I'm looking at purchasing a pistol for that purpose in the near future. The biggest hitch I've found in the search is how much capacity I want, balanced with concealability of the pistol.

My roommate had an incident a couple weeks back where a friend of his picked a fight with some gangbangers in a restaurant.  Fortunately cooler heads prevailed before he had to draw, and the situation deescalated.  However, during the tense moments was picking his priorities if he did need to draw and decided that if it came to it that 16 rounds from his HK 30 would not have been enough to deal with the 4 or so threats that he identified. He now carries an extra mag with him.

So I guess the question I have for you all is how much ammo do you carry with you when you carry, and how important do you think the magazine capacity is when selecting your carry gun?

I recently moved from NY to GA and have finally purchased a few handguns. I have been shooting rifles for many years but the first time I handled a handgun was a few months ago when I moved. I am applying for my CCW and was wondering which of the following guns (that I already own) that you would suggest starting off carrying for someone who has never done it before. I have already fired a few hundred rounds through each. I am a very small guy, 5'4"" 135lbs, so concealability is a major concern. I have already purchased a pocket/IWB holster for my LCP and an alien gear for my shield but am willing to get whatever holster for whatever firearm people recommend for someone my size. You all know more than me about this.

Edit: For those suggesting a particular firearm, I would appreciate if you could say why you would choose that one over the others. (e.g advantages/disadvantages)

* Ruger LCP .380acp w/ lasermax handguard
* Smith and Wesson M&amp;P Shield 9mm
* RIA 1911 (2011 tactical model) .45acp

I received my firearm permit about two weeks ago and passed my enhanced carry class this past weekend. (I live in MS.) It will be nice to walk right past any sign saying that firearms aren't permitted, and only be restricted in 3-4 different types of places. For those of you in MS, the class is well worth the $100 and I had a blast. I recommend the instructor I went with, but I won't be listing his name or site. Don't want to make it seem like I'm giving him a free advertisement, even though he deserves it. Message me if you want it, or if it's OK with the mods I'll edit this post with his name.

So, for my first day out carrying. First thing I did was pick up my enhanced carry sticker (IC sticker) from the state DPS office. Then spent the next 6 hours carrying at the following places:

* Joann's

* Target

* Payless Shoes

* Guitar Center

* Academy

* Whataburger

* Lowe's

* Walmart

Definitely didn't plan on going all of those places on my first day carrying. Eventually my gun just disappeared after a couple of hours and I was only aware of it while driving. My holster is a generic/cheap two clip kydex type that seems so popular and is tuckable (more on that in a minute) and worked fine with my shirt untucked. It's a little bulky so I purchased a leather, single clip tuckable holster from Academy.

Here's my problem: I tuck in my shirts for work (business casual) and church. I can't seem to make either of these holsters work while tucked in. No matter what I did the shirt looked sloppy, or it was obvious what was going on in my pants (har har), or my wife had to help me (which won't work in public). **Basically, I can't dress myself.**

I know what you're probably thinking... get a quality holster. And you're right, and I will, but $$ doesn't grow on trees around my house. But honestly I imagine I'll have the same problem. I don't think it's necessarily the holster, but what do I know compared to y'all that have carried for years.

Get a cover garment? Not in the south in the summer, Bubba.

If you haven't noticed my flair, I carry a Glock 27 IWB, 4 o'clock-ish. Like I said, I can carry fine when my shirt isn't tucked in. But the two places I tuck in for (and are the main reasons why I got my enhanced carry permit - church and college where I work) I can't carry in because I look like a 6 year old who dressed himself. I'm seriously considering a belly band or shoulder holster for tuck in occasions. Pocket carry is out of the question due to most of my pockets not being big enough for my gun.

Any suggestions?

Learning laws, accepted practices and such and slowly becoming much less oblivious to whats commonly accepted. I'm newly 21 and just picked up my license easily in PA. And that's where the story starts.

While I was filling out the form to get my permit, I recognized a girl at the counter that graduated a year before from my high school. I didn't quite realize it until she was gone. Well, I decided now would never be a better time to strike up a conversation. I mean, an attractive shooting buddy sounds pretty good to me. 

So I posted on her wall about seeing her at the sheriffs office and inquiring if she was getting a permit too. 

I didn't think much of it, just a friendly conversation that I didn't think was that big of a deal. 

She responds, saying ""yeah! how'd you know?"". In the meantime it took me to respond, my whole post was gone. I double checked and was kind of dumb founded about what happened. I didn't quite make much of it. Just a lost opportunity. I moved on.

Well, it hit me like a ton of bricks just recently that people, specifically her parents (dad), would care that her having a permit should not be public knowledge. Now I feel like a bit of a dick for posting that in the first place and realized how oblivious I was.

I'm an Illinois resident so I probably won't actually be carrying until next summer I'm guessing. The past couple of months I've been highly considering picking up a new XDs in 9mm. I already know that I want 9mm as the caliber. I know the XDs will be probably perfect for the summer. But I was wondering if I'll be spoiling myself by getting used to it and never wanting to try any other gun that has a double stack magazine.

If I decide to actually get a double stack, my options open up considerably. I could look at a G26 (never owned a glock), a compact M&amp;P or XDm. I also considered looking at some other compact brands. The only current handgun I have is a full-size XDm.

I'm a fairly thin so I get the feeling I'll have trouble hiding a double stack gun, but I wish there were more single stack options out there. I don't want a 1911 because I don't want a .45 or a manual safety. I don't mind the grip safety on the XD series because I'm already used to it from my full-size XDm.

Are there any other guns out there besides the common Glock, Springer, or S&amp;W line that I should take a look at? Preferably a thin/small one that a thin person could hide well? I'll probably look into appendix style carry as well. I hear it's easier for thin people to conceal that way.

Any suggestions or comments?

My local ranges don't seem to rent many of these, so I can't really try them out first, so help me out on a comparison?

I think I've narrowed it down to:  

* Kahr PM/CM/CW  
* Walther PPS

Actually there was an effect and I kinda half expected it because I work with a couple LEO's at the range that always say when they see one it is good because they know people that bother to go through and get these are responsible citizens. I have been carrying daily for a few years now and I am amazed this is the first time I have actually had to show my license but any way here is what happened.


I was being an idiot running a bit late to work this AM and trying to catch an arrow and I blazed right by him and I knew instantly he was going to come get me. He let me go through the arrow on the next cycle and I pulled into a parking lot shortly after. At first the guy was actually kind of being a prick giving me the cold routine ""I got you going XX over and..."" then the ol ""why are you going so fast"". He asked the same questions they all do but his tone was just a bit condescending for so early in the morning. I thought about being a dick back and giving him the am I legally required to answer this question? That really isn't my style though and I didn't have the mental state to try and pull that off so I just said ""yeah I am running a bit late and thought I would try to make the light"" as I gave him the guilty awkward smile.


He continued to be a bit stand offish as he asked for my license and registration. I gave him my drivers license followed by my CCL and then dove into a really messy glove box and flipped through about 6 expired registrations before I could finally find the right one and ""I have no idea how my glove box exploded like this"" I said.

He responded completely different got patient and then started to chat a bit as I was still fumbling through car repair receipts and expired registrations. I was floored how much his demeanor had changed and when I finally got the good registration out he gave my CC license back and gave me a ""ok sit tight for a sec"" as he went back to the cruiser but said it in a real casual manner like you would tell your buddy to sit tight for a sec as you got up to get more beers.


Still got a ticket but I have never got away in that county without one and all the cops in that county specifically have been pricks and god help you if you get one of their female officers. This was a much more pleasant interaction and his complete attitude 180 after seeing my CCL was the key to that. He never even asked if I was carrying, what I was carrying, or where. I am sure he knew I was armed, and I was with my XDm IWB and I had my G26 BUG in my EDC bag, and he didn't even seem to care.

Just thought that I would share my experience. I am in Colorado near Denver in the suburbs and traveling to my job in DTC if anyone is curious.

I figure that if it doesn't become second nature then I'll stop doing it (because honestly, it's a bit of a hassle). Today, I had a scheduled doctor's appointment before work and I considered not bringing my pistol. I decided it wouldn't be too hard to bring it and leave it in the car for the appointment, so that I could have it for the rest of the day. I should note that one of the main reasons I carry is because of my walking commute to work from where I park. I usually end up parking a mile or so from the office and walking in. Along the way I pass through some sketch areas. I do my best to follow standard safety procedures, but sometimes the nature of my work forces me to make this commute in the dark or at weird hours. Probably the sketchiest place of all is the methadone clinic next to my building. I have seen some real sights walking past there and have more than once taken the long walk around the building to the back door to avoid pulling out my wallet to get my keycard in front of someone who clearly is from the clinic loitering near the covered doorways outside the building. 

Anyway, my dr.s appointment made me late to work, but when I arrived there were police everywhere and the front door I normally walk in was cordoned off with police tape. When I got inside, I asked the security guard what happened and he said that someone from the clinic next door stabbed another rehab patient in the neck with a knife. He said it happened while he was out to lunch, which would've been about exactly the time I would have arrived at work if not for my appointment. Needless to say, witnessing a knife-wielding drug addict stabbing people in the neck would have been a good time to have a weapon to defend myself. Depending on the circumstances, I may have also drawn to protect the stabbing victim. I'm glad I wasn't there to have to make those choices and I'm glad I decided to go through the hassle of being armed just in case.

1329666586.0,27,self.CCW,pwhom,Case Study - What a CCW Permit Holder Should've Done in This Situation?,what-the-frack,29,2,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/pwhom/case_study_what_a_ccw_permit_holder_shouldve_done/,"Yesterday, I encountered a scenario that is still bothering me as I think about it. Let me describe the event for you, and then I'll tell you the thoughts that were going through my head as I was dialing 911.  Before we get started this occurred in the rural south - we don't get a lot of violence in public in my part of the world. I realize some people live in a much more violent world.   

What I want to ask CCWdit is what could've/should've been done, and what would the legal ramifications of the could've/should've been had a CCW intervened and possibly had to use deadly force. 

The scenario - I was at work yesterday. I was traveling in a van with 8 students (age 15-18 kids). I was the only adult/chaperone on this leg of the trip. Because I was driving a vehicle that I would have to get out in gun free school zones, I couldn't have carried a gun with me even if I had my CCW (which I don't - but I'm planning on it soon). 

Anyway, we stopped for a bathroom/food break and I'm the next to last person to come back to the van. As we come back about 50-70 yards away in the parking there is a very obvious domestic dispute going on. Typical yelling, screaming, ect.  I'm embarrassed my students have to see this, and wish it wasn't happening but when I get back to the van it's just yelling. 

While waiting on the last student the male goes around to the driver side where a female is sitting and starts punching the female in the face.  I immediately grab my phone and dial 911. Because we're in rural America at a random truck stop by the interstate 911 literally takes 3-5 minutes of transfers to get an operator. Once the operator gets my location she has to transfer me to the state police because I'm out of her area. 

During this time the male has charged the female 3-5 more times punching her visibly in the face multiple times each charge.  He stops and yells at her between charges.  Also during this time the female has called a family member or friend who has brought a minivan to pick the female and 3 children up. One of the children is in a baby carrier car seat. Also during this time I saw at least 8 other people videoing the event or calling the cops. There was one tiny lady in her 50s visibly yelling at the male to leave the female alone and leave the premises - she was 60 yards away or more. The male flipped her the middle finger and went on about his assault. After that the male appeared to be aware of the attention and yelled to the female being assaulted that he dared anyone to try to intervene. Implying he would hurt them too. 

Because of his threats I knew he was either armed or was used to violence directed at him. Along this time one of his ""home boys"" showed up and tried to calm him, but obviously ""had his back"" from the way they postured themselves and the way they left the scene by going in the store together.  The male, thought he was a gangster type from the way he acted.  Even though he looked more like the skater type with a bad attitude to me. He even yelled about being ""gangsta"" at one point followed by ""what's anyone going to do to me?""  He wore baggy jeans that he had to keep pulling up, and a baggy hoodie with skate shoes. 

After finally getting through to the state police dispatch the dispatcher took my description of the scene, the assailant, his friend, the plates from his vehicle, and assured me state police were en route. I also let the dispatcher know the female now had someone getting her away from the scene.  The female was crying, was bruised and was very shaken up. I left at that point to get my students away from anything else that could go bad in the event he came back out. There were plenty of witnesses, and many who were closer to the scene than myself.  Since my students care was entrusted to me that was my primary responsibility at that time. 

Also, around this time was when my last student arrived from inside the truck stop so we left the scene. No one spoke for the next 10 minutes or so of the trip, and after they had some time to process what happened, we had some great discussions about the right way men and women should love and interact with each other.  This included how no matter what, violence is not love, how women who get beat up emotionally or physically deserve better, and how men who are violent deserve no second chances and that was the only good thing that came from this. 

My thoughts - I tried to just state facts above, but this entire time I was thinking why isn't some good neighbor trying to intervene? Why aren't there more people out yelling at this guy, trying to make him stop?  While thinking this I was accessing his threat level, and I immediately thought he would have either a gun or knife on him. He was obviously violent, and couldn't be controlled with social stigma like shame or the like. In the end there were also 2 of him because his buddy showed up and had this posture of ""I've got your back.""

In this situation where I was primarily responsible for 8 underage students I couldn't have responded.  If something would've happened to me the student would be unsupervised in a seemingly dangerous place. I would have been fired and possibly sued for neglecting these students. 

But, I started thinking if I would have been alone and armed how would I have handled the situation. I immediately thought I would draw my gun and approach him asking him to lay on the ground and wait for police to arrive. Then I thought I shouldn't draw my weapon until I actually ""feared for my life.""  So I thought if I were to intervene I would've approached him to about 20 yards and then yelled for him to leave her alone and lay on the ground. When he tried to rush me I'd draw and he'd either comply or he'd take a shot. 

Having not taken my CCW class yet, I'm not sure which if either is legal, but I can tell you this. I'm ashamed that no one intervened, and I am even more ashamed that I was not able to intervene.  I feel sorry for the female in that situation that she had to get hit in the face 15 or more times while all I could do was watch while waiting for a 911 operator to pick up. I feel ashamed that those 3 kids had to watch their mother get assaulted by a violent man while no one intervened.  I feel ashamed of all the people there who sat on their phones and watched something that was wrong, both morally and legally go on without actively trying to stop it. But I understand why no one intervened. The male was violent and could have been armed, and if no one there was also armed then they could have been killed trying to do the right thing. 

Response time for you the reader - So CCWdit, what would you have done if you would have been in that parking lot with me as a private citizen. Would your actions be seen as legal in your home state? Give as much detail to let me know why. I'm genuinely interested because if I'm armed in the future I don't plan to sit idly by.  I don't want to shoot someone, ever, but I don't want to feel like this ever again. I believe this one encounter has changed my life, and I feel horrible that no one was able to help.  I feel like everyone in that parking lot was responsible for what was going on, and we're all guilty of being too afraid to do anything.  I think if more people we're armed this man's behavior would have be different; probably from the beginning because he wouldn't have been dumb enough to do this in public because an armed group would have stopped him, but definitely once 1 or 2 or 3 armed private citizens intervened once he displayed these actions in public. In an ideal world, he should have been laying on the ground waiting to be arrested while the female and her children were being helped by the rest of us. 

His behavior was inexcusable, and I hope he rots in jail for what he did yesterday.  With the legal system we have today, I'm not holding my breath. 

tl;dr (I know it was really long, but there's lots of info for the case - I'd recommend reading it - I think it will start an interesting discussion): I witnessed a domestic violence episode with yelling, punching, etc. against a seemingly helpless female in a public place. No one really responded except to call the police. I believe it was because the assailant looked armed and people were afraid - how would you have responded as a CCW permit holder or even as an unarmed private citizen?",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,True,t3_pwhom,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/pwhom/case_study_what_a_ccw_permit_holder_shouldve_done/,

I'm about 6'5'', weigh around 220 pounds, and generally dress casual (jeans, T-shirts, shorts, etc.) but would also like to be comfortable carrying in business casual attire.

Two of the main handguns I've settled on are the Walther PPS and the Ruger SP101. I wonder if they're unique choices, but after everything I've read, they seem to fit what I'd like them to do very well. For the moment at least, I'm partial to the Ruger--being my first handgun that I plan on carrying daily, I love the KISS option. I've also been looking at the S&amp;W revolver models, but a lot of their classic police revolvers don't appear to translate well for concealment.

I'd probably carry IWB or AIWB. I will definitely look into appendix carrying, as my professional field is very anti-gun. Barring any laws, of course, I'd like to carry wherever possible while keeping as concealed as possible.

Well, it's been in interesting couple of days.

I called my contact back yesterday to let him know I could find another reference, and that I was sorry if I put him in an awkward position at all. The conversation kind of went sideways from there.

He told me I have to wait one year before I'm allowed to apply for a CPL. I asked why, and he told me because it's illegal for me to possess a firearm. I asked why it was illegal, and he told me he would technically be in violation for not immediately coming to my house and seizing whatever firearms I might have. He assured me nothing like that would happen, but that it could and should. 

I don't know what state or Federal law he's referencing when he says these things... there's no one year limit from the last time you smoked or had an MMMP card... there's no Federal law I know of that says ""if you smoked in the last year..."", so I really don't know where it's coming from. Any follow-up question I asked after that was met with him telling me, again, that any firearms I had should really be seized... but that that wouldn't happen.

I can't help but feel a bit weird about that conversation. I have since reached out to the State Attorney General's office, the NRA, and a number of 2A lawyers in my state. I don't feel as if I am being told the whole truth here, and I'm not happy about it. I'm *not* saying I think my contact is fucking with me. He said he would talk to his boss and get back to me, and I think the things he's telling me are the things he's being told. Maybe I'm being naive, but that's what I believe at this time. 

I will continue to provide updates as I hear back from those I've reached out to, and thank you again to everyone here for your responses and information. 

You are **truly** appreciated. 

**EDIT --** Wow, that was fast. Heard back from one of the lawyers I contacted already. The long and short of it is, **having my card in no way legally affects my ability to own firearms or get a CPL under State law**. Federally, the position is held that just *having* a card is evidence of smoking dope and claim that you can't use or possess firearms from 12 months since your last use. *This* part is not law, it's just their current opinion. He says this would not hold up in court if you have not, in fact, used. He encouraged me to hire him if I got into trouble, and I am inclined to do so should the need arise.

""For me it comes down to 2
elements:  One is that I believe that the proliferation of guns in
America creates a culture of fear, suspicion of each other, and, to
those who carry guns, a quick and ready willingness to act- and I
speculate, a heightened level of testosterone in the body when
carrying a lethal weapon.  If you have a device like that, you're
going to want to use it, and you are simply waiting to be provoked to
fire.  The second element is WHO is legally able to attain guns.  As
stated earlier, individuals who are conscientious citizens are
generally capable of responsibly keeping a gun for defense or
otherwise- although when heightened emotion enters the equation of an escalating, life or death situation, judgement can become clouded.
It's the unconscientious citizens who are of concern; and I speculate
there are more of them then the former.  You may argue that this is
precisely the reason we need guns, but again I think of the culture of
fear this creates and look to the extreme tension that existed in the
1980s in my lifetime as the Cold War and 2 heavily nuclear armed
superpowers aimed everything they could at each other held their
scopes ready with tense and brittle fingers.  I don't want to live in
that culture.  To suspect that everyone is out to rob me or kill me -
so buy and carry a gun to, attempt to, neutralize that force.  I just
don't want to live that way.  I would rather be shot and killed then
succumb to living extremely defensively and suspicious all the time
and have to carry a firearm to feel safe.  I respect you, and
feel that you have the right to do whatever you like to ensure the
safety of you and your family.  But for me I prefer to simply live
positively, be in-tune with myself and with the energy around others
and situations I encounter- and if that energy is particularly heavy
or negative I know to avoid it-  and let that guide me through this

How many of you carry pepper spray as well as your ccw?  I don't currently carry a gun but i do often have pepper spray.  I think it has a few perks. 1. it can be used in those situations where pulling a firearm may be too extreme (non life threatening robbery, keeping a petty criminal at bay until the cops arrive) 2. it is psychologically much easier to spray someone in the face, than to shoot someone 3. it is almost always seen as a defensive move and the legal ramifications are WAY less than using a gun. 4. pepper spray is no joke, especially the ones mixed with tear gas.  one could argue that its initial ""stopping power"" can rival that of a gun, because it physiologically makes your eyes unusable. I have talked to some cops who had been both tazed and pepper sprayed during training and they said pepper spray is far worse.

I use the word debate loosely, because as per usual it was just a cavalcade of random opinions. But the one that stood out most to me was the one person in the class who claimed to actually have a license, but didn't think she should be able to carry while at school. I caught up with her after class and asked why. She said in her mandatory psyche evaluation when she got her New Mexico license, it said she has anger issues and she didn't trust herself not to shoot someone she got in an argument with. ""They make you get psyche evaluations in New Mexico?"" ""Yea they do that for everything. I just bought a military sniper rifle and I had to do one for that too."" ""Really? That shouldn't matter. Any long gun only requires a quick call to the national background check people."" ""Yea but it's like, not an ordinary rifle. It's a sniper rifle for the military"" ""Did you buy it in Texas because really it shouldn't matter."" ""I bought it from a military base.""

Obviously total bullshit. I just walk away from her at this point.  I check the New Mexico CHL regs and there is no mention of anything other than the normal background check. But now the whole class has the idea that even CHL holders don't think they should be allowed to carry on campus. It's infuriating, but what can I do? It'd be silly to expose her in class, or to tell the teacher that she is a liar liar pants on fire.

We were discussing how would would handle certain situations, because knowing what you'd do prepares you to do it.

We though of a few different scenarios:

1)  You are approched at knife point and demanded for your wallet.  (Note:  you believe, while he has a knife he just wants the wallet; no violence intend.)  Is is legal/advisable to pull the gun and tell him to drop the knife and walk away?  Or have him get on the ground and call the police? Or shoot him?

2) Same scenario, but they person appear obviously belligerent and violent.

3)  Now the mugger has a gun, instead of a knife.

4) Same as 1), 2), and 3) but you are with your significant other.

 
__________________________________________________________

Here's what I said:

1) Tell him to drop the knife and walk way.  BUT what about relational in the future?  (ie from a gang for embarrassing a member).  Does pulling a gun bot not using it classify as ""reckless endangerment""?

2) shoot twice, call the police, ect.

3) They get the wallet, BUT now they have my ID and that makes me very nervous.

4) If I am with my SO they are getting shot every time, no question.  I protect my wife.


Side note:  I plan my days so to avoid sections of town at certain times and such and don't leave my place after 10pm if I can help it.  I live in an area known for  muggings and violence, ect.

EDIT:  If it is helpful these answers are based on someone from KY

1360534773.0,23,self.CCW,189pix,Range Reports - Beretta Nano &amp; Beretta PX4 Sub-Compact 9MM,NeedlessKane,29,6,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/189pix/range_reports_beretta_nano_beretta_px4_subcompact/,"So this past week I went a little nuts and picked up two new Berettas - both of which I've been wanting for a while.  The intent was to pick up something that my fiancee would enjoy shooting as well as carrying with her. Whichever one she liked the best, I would take the other as part of my CC rotation. 

Nano:
Out of the box it has a really good feel. Fit and finish are superb - no rattles, etc. The magazines don't scream ""quality"" to me - compared to the PX4 mags, but they don't seem like they will bend/warp either. I stripped it down and it has an amazingly simple design and breaks down in a few seconds.  The sights are very good and easy to line up on target. I broke the gun down to check out the operation before I took it shooting as well as to clean it up a bit. It breaks down amazingly fast/easy.  

 Since the gun is DAO the trigger pull is a little stiff - ~8lbs but very very crisp. There is no creep and it breaks very nicely.  The recoil is VERY controllable, and is very accurate despite its size. I was able to put magazine after magazine in a relatively tight square @ 10 yards using this [target](http://www.targetz.com/targetzlib/10101.pdf).
I shot 50 rounds in total all with FMJ PMC Bronze 115gr and Monarch FMJ 115gr. I had one FTF on the first magazine, 2nd round. I cleared the FTF and didn't encounter any other issues. Despite it not having a slide lock, the FTF was easy to clear. I really don't consider that being a downside to the weapon. I prefer the snag-less design - nothing protruding from the sides of the gun to catch on anything during unholstering, etc.  The lack of external safety was something that took a little bit for my fiancee to accept. We attempted to pull the trigger by only grabbing the sides of the trigger, etc and it was a no go. The entire trigger mechanism must be pulled back in order to make it fire.

Overall - a great shooter, especially considering its size/compact design. My only complaint would be it's a little difficult to hold on to given the short grip and the 6 rd magazine. Beretta makes an 8 rd kit that lengthens the grip, which will make it more comfortable for people with large hands. My fiancee didn't have any issues with it in the 6rd configuration.

Beretta PX4 Storm Sub-Compact 9mm:
I already own the PX4 Compact in .40 and I've been very eager to see what the Sub-Compact had to offer.   Like my Compact, the feel in the hand is great - better than that of the Nano. It fills the hand and is contoured just right. It's hard to explain - I suggest going to your LGS and picking one up and seeing what you think.  The fit/finish are perfect - no rattles and the slide fits great on the frame.  Like the Nano I broke it down prior to shooting and the design of the Compact is pretty straight forward. It's easier to breakdown/put back together than my Compact primarily due to the lack of rotating barrel in the Sub-Compact.

In terms of shooting - it ran like a dream.  The added weight (~26oz vs ~19oz for the Nano) definitely helped with lining shots up again and again.  The double action first shot is quite a long pull - longer than the Nano.  The single action shots have some trigger take-up before hitting resistance, but no creep once the resistance is met.  A slight pull past the resistance is rewarded with a crisp break.  The sight profile is good, but not as good as the Nano.  I was shooting @ 15yrds with the same target as above and was easily putting groups in the center of the target.  I was also using the same PMC Bronze/Monarch FMJ 115gr ammo.  I had two FTFs on the first magazine, after that no more issues.

In terms of a solid CC weapon - the Nano is hard to beat. The snag-free design, lack of an external safety, slim design and great sight profile makes this a great choice in high stress situations.   For people wanting something easy to conceal - especially in a purse or a warm weather/shorts configuration the Nano is your ticket.  Both my fiancee and myself were able to put rounds in the kill-zone from 10 yds without much trouble. 

The Sub-Compact's biggest issue is its size - The damn thing is thick and heavy, so concealing it can be a challenge. I've been carrying my Compact for a while so I'm used to dealing with the bulky design in terms of concealment so I would carry the Sub-Compact without question. Regarding shooting - It is a more enjoyable shooting gun than the Nano and I find myself wanting to shoot it more.  The Storm is a good mix of a conceal weapon that is also a pleasure to shoot on the range for an extended time.  

Overall - Both great platforms, but different in terms of purpose.  The Storm is a great shooter than is also somewhat easily concealed. The Nano is a great concealed weapon that is also a great shooter.  

As a first CCW, I would say that the Nano would be hard to beat and would definitely be my pick despite never shooting an LC9/other guns in the the Nano's class.

Thanks r/CCW for the great find on Old Faithful Holsters.,MustardCosaNostra,33,8,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/14medp/finally_thanks_rccw_for_the_great_find_on_old/,"[Here it is!](http://i.imgur.com/fGfMe.jpg) This is the Old Faithful Holsters OWB High Rider. Black English Bridle Leather. Black Kydex. For my CZ75B. It took about twenty minutes to assemble because I was playing with the various tension, spacer and screw types. I ended up using medium spacers and medium screws, it just took a lot of alignment and torqueing without the screws protruding (ergo medium screws).  The only tools I needed were a hammer and a paper clip to help align the spacer, screw, washer and t-joint holes. So basically a hammer and the included wrench is what you need.

I'm wearing it right now to break it in and it is actually more comfortable that I expected. The weight on my 5 o'clock position is the only thing I notice about wear it. The leather sandwiched between a t-shirt and zipper fleece hoodie feels very comforting.

Clint Smith said that carrying should be more comforting than comfortable, but this feels pretty good. I can jump up and down,  bend over, move around and tilt without the gun moving or feeling any different.


**But its thanks to you r/CCW** that I found the promo code to get my first holster. Your glowing recommendations really made this feel like a good purchase, and for $30 on a holster that assembled would cost $75 is really a treat. Thanks!

**EDIT:** I should add their customer service is great. I placed the order on November 16th, supposed to ship on the 18th to 25th. By December 3rd I did not have it yet. But I did get an email from the actual head of shipping at OFH explaining that they are experiencing high demand for the holidays and were a bit behind. This was actually from a real person at the company. I responded saying that I could wait for a good product and that I appreciate their consideration. She responds wanting to know what else they could do. I told them I'd like to see a molding for a CZ 2075 RAMI at some point. Apparently she will pass that on to production.

Great customer service!

Anyway, we had two instructors: one the gun-store manager, and the main one (the one who signed our certificate) a active Detroit Police Officer. This intrigued me because I have a pretty dim view of the DPD.

I was initially worried the whole class would be like Drivers Ed and pretty much be 8 hours of scared-straight threats. It turned out to be anything but. Since MI has castle doctrine and no duty to retreat, he spent a lot of time going over use-of-force laws and scenarios with people.

The class itself was very diverse. 24 people, 6 women, white/black was about 70/30. Age was all over the place, from barely 21 year olds to a white haired little old lady. Both the men and women seemed to be financially diverse also, from the ""redneck"" types to the ""blue bloods"". All were there.

It was interesting because, besides the fact that the main instructor is a high ranking cop, both men had personally used force. Gone through the trauma, lawyering up, and all that. Also, even though the cop had investigated hundreds of homicides, he was adamant in teaching us not to talk to the cops, which I already knew but it was good to hear right from a homicide cop.

One of the students was obviously a boy from da-hood, and presented a lot of ""what if"" scenarios, which I got the impression they weren't actually ""what if"". That made for interesting interaction between him and the instructor. Thankfully, MI law is very much on the side of the victim.

Of course we watched some NRA videos on the topic. That was... interesting. My main take-away from them is I'm really happy MI does not require you to warn and announce.

All in all, I probably wish the class was twice as long. Some people obviously struggled with the range part. I'm not worried about them carrying, but I doubt the effectiveness of it for their own sake unless they really get out and practice. That gun store give 3 months of range membership with a gun purchase, (which I am already taking advantage of), so hopefully they will.

All in all it was a great experience. I'm very much inclined to take their tactical course this winter sometime. Now it's time to put in the paperwork, money, and wait.

**tl;dr** It was good for what it was

And they usually go along the lines of ""so i was nervous when i started, then no one noticed, then I was fine"".  And I'm not putting those people down, but those types of stories never really comforted me prior to me carrying.

So here's how it may actually go for you.

You'll probably get your license in the mail.  ""WOW, COOL!"" is what you'll be thinking, but you'll keep a straight face as you (or if you) tell anyone so you don't seems like a crazy person.

It's alright to be excited, everyone is!  If it doesn't come as a 'card' you'll laminate it and throw it in your wallet/purse/man satchel/fanny pack.  Next you'll go look at your gun and think 'Ok, I'm ready for this... this is what I've been waiting for'.

You've trained for this, taken classes for this, and gone through 100's if not 1000's of rounds of ammunition to make sure you're as proficient as you should be.  So, let's do it!  You slip your gun into your holster.  It fits firmly and you know how it acts because you've worn it around the house for what seems like the longest time.  As you're about ready to head out of the door you double check everything.  Gun... check,  firmly in holster... check, photo ID... check, no printing... check.  LET'S GO!

You hop in your car and start to drive away.  Suddenly you're not so confident with yourself.  But that's alright, you're only going to pick up a few groceries.  As you approach the grocery store you become more and hyped up.  The adrenaline is pumping through your system... you have a loaded firearm.  And as you pull into your parking spot you start to think about all of the things that could go wrong.

What if you brush against someone and they feel your gun.  Or what if you start printing?  Or what if the WORST thing possible happens (short of having to use it of course) and your holster has a catastrophic malfunction and your gun falls to the floor... IN FRONT OF EVERYONE?!  No, no... you've come this far and you can't back out now.

Of course in the grocery store you'll make some mistakes.  Maybe you reach for the milk on the top shelf because it has a better expiration date and you flash the handle of your gun.  Or possibly you bend down to grab your absolute favorite cereal and as you stand up your shirt catches on your grip.  You'll constantly be fixing your shirt and pulling it down.  You don't think anyone saw and you don't want to look 'sketchy' so you play it cool (think blues brothers level of cool).

You know what though?  It's OK you made those mistake because you learned from them.  Next time you'll know how not to make those mistakes.  Remember, this takes practice!

As you approach the check out counter your adrenaline is still at the same level you went into the store with.  You pay and leave, phew... it's done.  BUT WAIT, you still have the drive home.  During that, all you can think about is ""I just walked through a store while carrying... finally! But what if an officer pulls me over now?  What do I say? What do I do?  WE NEVER WENT INTO THIS MUCH DETAIL DURING MY CC CLASS!"".  You pay extra attention to speed limits and laws, you do not want to get pulled over.  And finally, you're home... you've done it!

Boy, was that ever nerve racking.  Your adrenaline is subsiding and you feel a huge sense of relief and accomplishment washing over you.  You know that every time you carry in the future it will be easier.  But that first time, that was crazy... scary... and maybe even a little (could it be?) fun?

I'm a really skinny guy (5'8"" 130lbs). When researching my own options for my first ccw, I came across the dilemma of trying to find a gun/holster combo that was small enough to conceal well, but not a pain to shoot. I was afraid of making a purchase too early and regretting it later.

I decided on single stack subcompact types at first, and started shooting some... Well I didn't like the feel of most of them, and they were uncomfortable to shoot for me (your mileage may vary). I got a little frustrated until I saw how relatively skinny the SR9c was. I did more research and decided it was my best option for being the skinniest double stack compact pistol I could find.

Once settled on the gun I went for one of the cheapest custom holsters that people spoke well of: enter the PJ Holster. I was still afraid of the possibility of printing and not concealing well on my small body but I went for the SR9c/PJ Holster combo and I couldn't be happier with the outcome!

Anyway, I realized that during my research I had never found many pics or videos of skinny people like myself demonstrating, so I made my own video real quick to hopefully help others out there in deciding.

It seems as if everyone, including the media, is portraying the shooter as the bad guy when there hasnt been much detail on the initial attack.  I feel that the man was quick to pull his gun and probably wasnt in a life or death altercation with the other man but that is only speculation.

In Dallas, CCW was a no brainer. My life was basically my house, to my car, to work, to friends places/restaurants/movies/shopping, and back to my car to go home. In that kind of low-people-density scenario where cars are always used, I would somewhat easily know if there was a threat in advance. If I'm walking to my car, and someone is following me, I know something is wrong. If If I'm out somewhere and someone is shady/dangerous/psychotic, he is usually readily apparent.

In Seattle, it's entirely different, and I feel like my carrying a gun is more of a risk than not. I walk almost everywhere here, and there are dense crowds all around. Also, there are transient bums and psychotic people yelling and screaming on the street, who seem to pose threats, but 99.9% of the time never harm anyone. People asking for one thing or another approach you on the street constantly, usually pan handlers, but sometimes they don't always look like pan handlers. 

If I'm walking around in Seattle, I can't really perceive a threat until it's within inches of me because it's so crowded with people, many of whom violate personal space and plain act weird all the time. 

The cherry on top is that this is a very liberal place, not like Texas where people are sympathetic to those who carry guns and defend themselves. So even if I did justifiably shoot someone, I'd feel a lot less confident about the legal outcome in Seattle. 

All in all, I feel like the gun is more of a liability in Seattle than an insurance policy. I feel like when you combine the odds of shooting a bystander in a crowd, prematurely shooting a weirdo who looks psychotic but isn't really a threat, someone getting so close that you can't use the gun without risking it being taken away, and then getting screwed in the courts for using it, it's not worth it. 

I'm sure there are some real ninjas out there who have 100% confidence in their ability to always perceive threats from afar and use a gun without any risk of it being taken away, but I'm honest enough to admit I'm not one of those. I've never been involved with close combat, so I'd probably not fare well. The only advantage a gun has for me is being able to identify a threat at a distance and stop him before he gets any closer. 

Now, this isn't to say I think carrying nothing is good. I just think carrying a big canister of pepper spray makes more sense. 

No matter what, it's a gamble. Even in Seattle I'm aware there are scenarios that would make a gun better than pepper spray. But it's all about odds.

Did I mention I'd rather be dead than in prison?

I just applied for my CCW in Nevada the other day. I have a Kholster IWB holster for my S&amp;W Sigma .40. I am practicing carrying it around the house right now. I want to get a good feel for it so I will be more comfortable and can conceal it properly in public when I can do so.

Do you have any tips/ lessons learned from your experience with carrying a concealed weapon? 

Some examples might be:

-Best place on your belt for the holster 

-How to behave so observers wont figure out you're carrying

-Good wardrobe ideas or principles for the CCW holder

-The impact carrying has had on your lifestyle

Thanks all!

I want to be able to carry everywhere I go, but when I can't bring a firearm with me for approximately half of my waking hours, I sort of have to wonder if there's even a point to it.

You could say ""well if you're carrying properly, no one will ever know that you're breaking the rules,"" but that just doesn't really reflect reality.  Retail pharmacies are tiny places that are generally crammed full of people (techs) that are constantly bustling about eachother.  I obviously don't carry now, but I accidentally bump into one of my techs, or a shelf, or the counter at least once a day.  *Eventually*, someone would notice that I was carrying despite my best efforts to conceal.

So it's not that I'm worried that [I would be fired after having to defend myself](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/fired-walgreens-gun-toting-michigan-pharmacist-filled-robbers/story?id=13705438#.T3xVQNXzQwY), because better to be alive without a job than dead, but that I'd be fired just because a tech accidentally bumped into my side and wanted to know what that hard metal object near my waist was.

So you might say that, even if I can only carry to the bank, grocery store, movies, restaurants and other places that aren't work, that it would still be worth it.  But how do you even build up the ""carry always, everywhere, no matter what"" mentality that is necessary for proper concealing when I can't carry outside my home the vast majority of times?  What would I even do with my CCW while I was at work?  I remember asking HR if it was ok to leave a gun in my car in the parking lot after signing that ""no firearms"" policy, and the guy had no actual clue so he said ""no"" just to be safe.

Basically I'm asking... what would you do in my position?  ""Get a new job where you can carry"" is not really an option.

**Edit:** I live in North Carolina and our state ""[does not have a blanket Parking Lot Storage law.](http://www.handgunlaw.us/states/northcarolina.pdf)""  Furthermore, ""any private premises where notice that carrying a concealed handgun is prohibited by the posting of a conspicuous notice or statement by the person in legal possession or control of the premises"" is one of the places listed where carrying is off-limits even with a permit.  So from what I gather, if my work tells me I can't carry in the parking lot, then there's no law that says that I can, and they have the legal right to tell me that I can't.

I've also just now learned that carrying (even with a permit) is also illegal in ""areas of emergencies or riots.""  Doesn't that sort of defeat the purpose?

So my friend is about to purchase his first house, and I'm planning on moving in with him. He picked me up at work, and since I work at the airport, I don't carry to/from work. We go to the first house, meet the realtor, look around, and decide to drive to the next house. As we're following the realtor, he makes a mistake and misses our turn. We cross the street we're supposed to make a left on (Camp Creek Pkwy for any ATLiens on here) and then make a left on to a side street to turn around. My friend, the driver, follows the realtor back on to the road that leads to Camp Creek, and somewhat cuts off the white Lexus SUV behind us. Now, this isn't a great area, but it's not horrible either. Anyway, this guy speeds up, is talking on his cell phone, and almost rear ends us. My friend flips him off. At this point, we're trying to get into the right hand turn lane to get onto Camp Creek Pkwy. This guy goes around us, cuts us off, parks his car, and gets out. Comes us to the window screaming his head off, and punches the window. At this point, I'm really really wishing I had my .40. He's still screaming; we're not saying anything. He goes back to his car, then gets back out with something in his hand- at this point I have full on regret that I wasnt carrying, because I had no idea what it was. Turns out it was a pen. We speed off around him with his license plate number and call the cops. I doubt anything came of it, but it was still a pretty eye opening experience.

Five years ago, (Before I bought or was really interested in shooting) I was having some problems with depression, and some relationship issues that I sought psychiatric help for. It started with medication, and later, it got bad enough that I decided it would be a good idea to admit myself to a county mental hospital. I regretted this decision immediately. It wasn't a bad experience, but I quickly realized it was a mistake. During that time I had thoughts of suicide. I decided that I did not want to hurt myself or anyone else, and that the best way to get over it was in the hospital. I probably could have sought more intensive therapy, but it seemed pretty dire at the moment.
A few months after treatment, I got a really good job in a medical research lab studying cancer, and a friend of mine from school took me shooting. He had a pistol, and I was immediately hooked. I spent a few months deciding if I was ready to buy a gun. I mean, I gave it many hours of thought. My mom was a little weary at first, but after a few minutes talking to her she understood. I grew up around guns. My dad had a reloading setup in my bedroom closet (we lived in a small apartment growing up) and when I told him I bought a pistol, he didn’t say anything about it, in fact, I think he was delighted.
Now, I live in Texas, and the CCW laws do have a few lines concerning this (besides what’s stated below, there’s a few lines about being of sound mind to store a handgun, section d under ELIGIBILITY)

(f) Notwithstanding Subsection (d) (about storage), a person who has previously been 
diagnosed as suffering from a psychiatric disorder or condition described 
by Subsection (d) or listed in Subsection (e) is not because of that 
disorder or condition incapable of exercising sound judgment with respect 
to the proper use and storage of a handgun if the person provides the 
department with a certificate from a licensed physician whose primary 
practice is in the field of psychiatry stating that the psychiatric disorder or 
condition is in remission and is not reasonably likely to develop at a future 
time.

I’m currently tapering off my medication, (and I’m feeling a lot better) and I have no doubt that if I asked my psychiatrist about providing documentation, she would definitely do it. I strongly believe she doesn't think I pose a danger to myself or my community. I have a few LEO friends who would definitely do the same, and one even told me that he’s glad I’m almost off the medication because it made me “twitchy and paranoid.”
I don’t want to apply to the state for the CCW only to be denied and have to go though some sort of hearing, and possibly have unwanted scrutiny over my situation (and my the contents of my safe) by the TxDPS or any other LE agency.  If I voluntary entered a COUNTY hospital, I figure the state would know about it when I turn in the application for CC.
Guns are my favorite hobby (I’m not really an athletic kind of guy) and I take my security seriously being a past victim of violent crime, and everyone I know that knows I have weapons knows I’m a responsible owner. After I bought my first firearm, went out shooting a few times, learned to completely disassemble and assemble and clean my gun, I thought to myself that I’d never kill myself, because then I wouldn’t enjoy my favorite hobby. As I write this I’m imagining a lot of people might say “fuck this crazy kid, he shouldn't have a gun or a CCW!!”
 Is there anyone here who has been in a similar situation? Did you have to provide documentation? Did you “declare” this when filling out the application? Or, did you not declare, and nothing happened? I’m particularly interested in a LEO’s perspective. I understand CCW requires a little bit different mindset than that of simply owning a weapon, but from what I hear, a fair percentage of people with permits don’t really give much thought about what circumstances they will pull their weapon or not… which kinda scares me.

Last night, I finished the NRA's ""Basic Pistol Shooting"" Course, which satisfies the educational requirement for the ""Enhanced Carry"" endorsement. The MS State Legislature actually did something right in allowing current CCW license holders to get further education and an endorsement that allows them to carry in places otherwise prohibited by state law. By finishing the 8-hour NRA Basic Pistol course, CCW license holders may carry in courthouses (not court rooms), on school grounds, at athletic events, in churches, etc. - basically anywhere but what is prohibited by federal law.  I think our legislators did something good, for once...

Regarding the class - it was excellent.  The class covers the very basics, some of which was boring, most of which was review. However, we had a great instructor who made it quite bearable.  There was absolutely no political commentary and no ""war stories"" from him, other than what qualified him to teach the class (SWAT training instructor and 3 years of overseas personal protection duty as a team leader).  The class I took was limited to 10 and there were a few of us with significant experience around firearms, just as there were 4 who had never previously handled a firearm.

Regarding course content: The class followed the NRA curriculum and covered the basic parts of pistols, aiming, cleaning, etc., as well as proper grip and stance. The most beneficial addition to the NRA required material was the section on MS law - when and where you can carry, as well as obligations and planning each CCW license holder should consider. There is a written test and a range qualification (shot on a bowling pin target) - 5 rounds shot at 3, 5, 7 and 10 yards on night 1; same for night 2, with the addition of two 5 round magazines at 5 yards, rapid-fire.

For those who have to take classes to get CCW, I can certainly see the benefit. For those of you in MS who have the ""standard"" / shall-issue permit, I highly recommend the ""Enhanced Carry"" permit and hope the class you take is as beneficial as I found the one in Meridian. 

*edit: For those of you who work in ""At Will"" work states, remember this: Just because your state law says you can carry in certain places, your employer's policy supercedes this law. If you employer says you cannot carry on their property, your CCW permit is useless, and it is lawful for them to terminate you based on violation of company policy.  I should have known this, but had never really thought about it.

Before I applied, I made sure there were no ""No Concealed Weapons"" signs (in MO there must be), and I Googled a bit to find what their general corporate policy on in-store carry was. Everything looked great!

However, I just completed orientation, and it turns out that policy only exists for the customers. Employees are not allowed to have firearms or knives (except box cutters) on company property, or they will be fired. I _really_ don't want to risk my job, as this company is otherwise awesome.

Here's the kicker: I walk to/from work, through about a mile of bad neighborhoods. This can and will often happen in the dark, sometimes as late as 10:00pm. The kind of bad neighborhoods where if I didn't carry myself as though I was already carrying concealed, I'd probably be mugged.

So, I have a few avenues. I could talk to corporate HR and ask them for special permission. I could talk to my store manager and ask him for permission. I could either ask for permission to carry, or permission to walk to and from work with it, leaving it in a locked locker all day. Or I could just carry anyways, and hope I don't print and get fired--I _really_ don't want to get fired, I could see making this company my career. I could get a bicycle and cycle to/from work, hoping to outrun any threats (which I can't do on foot) in the bad part of town, instead of defending myself.

He had a cellphone case that looked, at first, like a handgun holster. He came around back to unload the massive amounts of books he wanted to donate. I told him, ""At first I thought you were open carrying a handgun when you walked in and was going to make a supporting comment about it, but then I noticed it was a cellphone."" 

He responded with, ""Yeah, I remember one time I was open-carrying in Wal*Mart and a kid just kept staring at my G19 on my hip. Finally he asked me why I was carrying a gun. I responded with, 'to kill people with,' and his mom carried him off to a different lane to check out. I was giving him the harsh reality.""

I was sort of flabbergasted at that and just said, ""Well that was sort of harsh and probably a little dangerous.""

He said, ""Well I just spoke before I thought, I guess.""

That mentality is the type that anti-gunners love to use against law-abiding gun owners. Being that blood-thirsty cannot be healthy and it gives people like me a bad rap. I don't know, maybe that guy had some kind of weird sense of humor.

Im in a business setting (tucked in polos in khakis ) so cargo pants aren't really an option. If it matters I sit 90% of the day so stuff in my pockets are always jabbing me from various spots and its near impossible to get comfortable

Ive never liked belt clip on cell phone holders and open carry / OWB is not even remotely possible due to the environment. Belly bands / smart carry /cell pal seem impractical, ankle hostlers Ive tried make me nuts. 

I have a feeling the response is going to be get a cell phone belt clip thingy and a tuckable IWB or just carry less junk. But Im curious if anyone else has had a more creative solution to still look business professional and not look like you have on a batman utility belt (no offense to batman) .

As I read through the CCW subreddit, I see the same questions asked over and over.   

So to that end I asked ChewWork (the CCW moderator) if he minded if I solicited everyone's opinions on these very common questions. Kind of like a CCW FAQ I guess you could say. To by honest, my motivation is biased, I want to know these answers for my own use :) But if I can compile the answers and put them up, make them available to everyone, it may do some good. ChewWork said he would link the information on the side bar, so it'll be readily available to the reddit community.   

So, please reply to this with:   

* your carry gun make and model (list a few pro's and con's please)    

* the holster you use make and model (pro's and con's)    

* Any other information you think is useful for a new CCW holder   


I envision creating a table styled web page listing information along with a link to the manufacturer's website and whatever else information we find handy and would like to pass along. I will pass it along when I get a good amount of information. The document can and will be kept up to date and modified, but I'd like a nice amount of information to start with.

However, I am interested in spreading this idea of personal responsibility to people that I am friends with and care about. There seems to be a fine line between peaking interest in other people's minds about learning more about CCW and ""OMFG YOU HAVE A GUN!!! WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT EVIL THING!!!""

He was a father of four afaik, not three as the article says.  He worked security at my job, he also worked at Fed-Ex overnight.  He was the first CCW'er I ever met.  He showed me how to handle my gun when I first got it.  He was well put together, somewhat flashy.  Last time I saw him in early June, he showed up in a Panamera to show me his newborn son.  

As the NBC article mentions in a not so clear light, [he did have 3 felony charges for assault with deadly weapon without intent to kill](http://florida.arrests.org/Arrests/Kishon_Dacosta_8154711/).  The charges stem from [this incident that I've been waiting to post](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ELpSBIlow) for awhile, but haven't since the court case wasn't over yet.  Basically three people are in the Toyota, Kishon is in the Acura.  His Corolla was in the shop, and he had forgotten to get the gate remote out.  He had thrown his gun on the front seat of the Acura (according to him). He was on the phone with his wife that was letting him in the gate, but the guy in the Toyota thought he was trying to tailgate.  The three individuals in the Toyota claimed he pointed a gun at them to get them to move from blocking the gate.  One individual was able to identify the exact model  of the gun (two tone Sigma), the other two individuals recanted their statements (contradictory).  

He was happy the case was coming to a close, he said he was looking forward to getting his CCW reinstated.  Just sucks it didn't happen fast enough.  [My mom's pregnant niece was shot last summer](http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/06/26/2868518/pregnant-woman-shot-to-death-by.html) and I could post an extensive list of the firearm violence my family has encountered.

Before anyone answers, I draw from a slightly slanted vertical shoulder holster. So it points mostly down but rotated slightly for the barrel to face the ground directly behind me instead of my pelvis.

NOW, many people say ""You sweep the room every time you draw.""

This is inaccurate.

When you draw you pull out, still pointed at the ground, and twist as you come up to aim at your target. EVEN IF you cross draw or draw same side, same goes. Still have yet to see this ""sweep"" people refer to. Not a great draw motion, but if in the car, it feels WAY better than IWB to draw, even with the retarded torque motion. 

So, okay NOW... it is for the car CCW and, maybe running in and out doing errands. You understand now that even though its not the BEST draw motion, it still does not sweep when you draw, explain why a shoulder holster sucks....
