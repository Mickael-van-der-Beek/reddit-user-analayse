I usually lurk on nosleep, but i figured this would fit in here. I'm not even sure if this is slenderman, because I had the dream before I even knew about him. Well here it goes..

Me, my mom, and brother were driving to who knows where in the woods, and all of a sudden, the trees change. Instead of the leaf-less trees we passed earlier, the trees with covered with dead bodies, hanging off the branches. There was hundreds of them. My mom and brother, however, didn't notice them, even though the police came to investigate.
So eventually the dead bodies appear less and less, and we come across what looked like an abandoned circus/arcade. Nothing was happening for a while, we just split up and looked around on our own. I was in the arcade, looking around and seeing if any of the old-fashioned games, like pac-man, still worked. Sadly, no. 
Next thing I knew, an old classmate of mine (and a slutty one at that), comes into my dream. She was being carried away by a bald man wearing a suit, which now that I think about it, could have been slenderman, but I never looked at his face. But he was taking her away, obviously by force, hence she was screaming. I had no clue he could of had something to do with the dead bodies. My dream then cut to a birds-eye view of the arcade, and it was actually a maze, that I had to find my way out of, and find my old classmate, and then find my family and get the hell out of there. Unfortunately, this is all I remember about my dream. I don't know what happened after that, to me, my family, or my old classmate. Let me know what you guys think!

1343878627.0,50,self.SlenderMan,xjmrp,Slenderman Encounter,,65,15,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/SlenderMan/comments/xjmrp/slenderman_encounter/,"I had always been a skeptic when it came to the paranormal and things of that nature, and I’m still completely confused about the event in which I am about to elaborate on, but I guess I’ll just leave you all to decipher this.
It was about midway into April, and unusually warm for that time of year in my area.  I did not even need the light jacket that my mother insisted I wear as I went for a walk on the bike trail that weaved its way through my relatively small town.  I had tied the yellow piece of clothing around my hips, feeling the ruffles of fabric sway as I walked steadily down the path.  There were several bikers and runners that passed me by that day, due to the nice weather, and I would accordingly exchange the occasional smile and nod as they went on their way.  
Being somewhat of a paranoid person when alone, even in the afternoon, I was oddly relaxed that day.  I had slept ten hours straight the night before - impressive for me, who usually sleeps between eight and nine hours with some early morning bathroom breaks.  I also usually walk with friends or with my grandma on the bike trail, so this was a change from my normal habits.  
Anyway, as I reached the two mile marker, I decided to stop at an approaching bench to rehydrate and rest.  As I sat, slouched against the wooden backing of the bench and sipping my water, I stopped mid-sip and listened.  It was extremely quiet – almost too quiet.  No birds singing, so squirrels jumping from the limbs of trees…not even any people seen or heard coming from either direction.  It was rather eerie, I admit, but being in the mood I was in, I didn’t give a second thought.
As I stood, I got a small cramp in my leg.  Wincing, I sat back down to rub out the cramp, sighing heavily in the process.  Just as the sigh left my mouth, I immediately held my breath.  A strange, mental pressure overcame me, one so strong that it almost felt physical.  It seemed to bore into the back of my head, as if a pair of radioactive eyes was inches from my messy ponytail.  I was afraid to move for what was probably several seconds, and then I briskly stood, ignoring my still throbbing calf, and began jogging down the path, refusing to look over my shoulder.
After a few minutes of jogging, I decided to glance behind me.  Seeing nothing, my nerves relaxed, and I slowed to a walk, taking a long swig from my water bottle.  Then it came again – that same, skull-drilling sensation on the back of my head.  It was not as strong, but still there.  I tried to brush it off, but with every passing second, it became the tiniest bit stronger, to the point where I had to look behind me.  
I turned my head around as far as I could, still walking, and what I saw make my heart stop.  There, right in the middle of the path, was a man, about middle-aged and with dirty gray-brown hair hanging from beneath an orange baseball cap.  He was wearing what looked to be several layers of clothing, including a large orange jacket, but one could tell he was quite burly underneath all that clothing.  He also wore a pair of thick work pants like the ones my dad used to wear when he worked at the Home Depot.  His steel-toed boots were caked in thick mud, like the mud that lined certain spots of the trail, and some spots were already drying.  He looked to be paused in a tip-toeing stance, his scraggly, bearded face one of slight shock when my eyes met his.  I wasn’t for sure, but I got the distinct feeling that he was not just an innocent man going for a stroll, especially considering he was taking care not to make any sounds while walking.  I felt that he meant harm, but I was frozen where I was at the time, unable to move.  We stared at each other for only a few moments before he advanced.  I snapped out of my shock and bolted in the opposite direction.  This guy was fast albeit being dressed the way he was, and I panicked as I pumped my legs, urging them faster than they had ever gone before.  My breath came in gasps as my stomach tightened into a knot, and my eyes burned with tears as the wind whipped into them.  I kept telling myself I was screwed, and that I should have joined track.  He was evidently an athlete, or at least used to be one, for his arms and legs were moving in sync, steadily pumping as he gained on me.  I glanced back only once and thought I saw a murderous twinkle in his eye, which only further motivated me to get the heck out of there.
Just a few dozen yards from where the trail ends and a busy intersection starts, the pain in my calf came shooting back up my leg, worse than ever.  I immediately became disoriented through pain and panic and tripped over my own foot, falling and skidding onto the cement.  I squeezed my eyes shut and curled into a ball, not even attempting to get up and run.  The heavy footsteps of the man were beside me in no time, and all there was left was to wait until he grabbed me, or stabbed me, or whatever it was he had in mind.
I tried to scream as he grabbed my elbow with bone-crushing strength, but I only managed a squeak before that hand was inexplicably jerked away.  Keeping my eyes screwed shut, I heard him swear, then scream and run away from the direction in which we both had come.  He didn’t get far, for I heard his footsteps stop abruptly, then I heard a loud thud and the sound of tree branches shaking violently, as if something as hit one of the many trees that lines the trail.  
A second passed.  Then two.  Then ten.  Nothing was happening.  Silence had fallen over the area once more.  I was shaking, my breath still coming in rasps as I tried to muster up enough courage to open at least one of my eyes.  The tears of fear that had been held back spilled down my cheeks as I slowly sat up, opening my eyes and looking down the path.  My eyes became as wide as saucers as I looked at what was down that path, just a few yards from my current position.
The strangest and most startling man I had ever seen, save for the one that chased me, was standing in the middle of the trail, towering a good nine or ten feet from the top of his head to the ground.  The thing I noticed first was his face – that is, the absence of his face.  He had starch white skin stretched over a blank façade, expressionless and without the features that one would associate with the normal human head.  There were no eyes, no nose, no mouth…only skin.  That is, I assumed it was skin; the man looked more as though he were made of ceramics - or even fine cloth - than of flesh.  I could see where he may have eye sockets, and where a nose might have been, but everything else was like staring at a sheet of blank paper.  
I did not see whether or not he had ears, for my eyes lingered to the inky black tentacles that slowly writhed around his unnaturally thin frame, whipping the air in slow motion as if he were an octopus underneath water.  He wore a jet black business suit and a black tie, appearing almost elegant and mannerly along with his silent and disturbing presence.
It was Slenderman.  
I was petrified, to say the least.  I stared at him for the longest time, my heart thumping loudly in my ears as I waited whatever would come next.  He didn’t seem to want to hurt me, but at the same time I wondered where the heck he had come from, and what had happened to the creeper.
I glanced ever so slightly to the side, seeing that the branches on a tree to the left were still swaying.  There was a large dent midway up the truck where some of the bark had fallen off.  A red substance dripped from the center of that spot, falling in small drops to the ground where there was a small pile of chipped bark and an orange baseball cap.
A neighbor had apparently found me unconscious on the trail about twenty minutes later and took me to the hospital.  I don’t remember much about my stay, other than the blinding headache and strange dreams of the tall man in the suit.
I have spent much more of my time lately researching Slenderman, wondering why he saved me from certain doom instead of terrorizing me like he allegedly had in so many other accounts, such as Marble Hornets and EverymanHYBRID.  I guess it will have to remain a mystery - at least until I see him again.

That's all. We were having a fun night, but it started to flatten out, so we decided to play a game. We were not drunk, we weren't high. Just bored friends on a Thursday night. We got dressed to go outside. It was one of the first chilly nights, the kind of night where you know that the summer season is almost gone. We got dressed and headed outside. The city was quiet, but bot unusual, it was Thursday. We headed over to the dry canal bed, the one that ran through the city. The one they paved over. It had all sorts of bridges passing over head. The eight of the ten of us had the pages. The ones inspired from the game online. We wanted to scare the other two. We headed down the canal bed. One by one, with long lengths between, ""we found"" the pages. We were at the fourth note, and I was about to ""find"" the fifth, when ahead in the distance, he stood. We were just coming out from under a bridge, and halfway to the next, he stood. Solitary, motionless. I looked over to one of the friends in in the joke, and whispered ""Who is that?"" ""No clue."" was her reply. Still we were nervous, so we back tracked to a staircase and headed up to street level. Continuing, I revealed the next note. As soon as I did, someone screamed. I tore around, and Mike and Sara were gone. Just two notes floating to the pavement. This wasn't planned. They weren't supposed to do this. Sara wasn't even in on the joke. We searched and searched, but we couldn't find them. Eventually, I revealed the joke to Jake, the other who wasn't part of the scam. And they still didn't show their faces. We said fuck'em, an headed back to my apartment. On the door to the building, was a note. One from the game. I didn't think anyone else had seen it, so I ripped it down and shoved it in my pocket. Heading inside, we found out the door was locked. My roommate, Mike, had the keys, so we buzzed a few times and nothing. I noticed it then. In the reflection of the glass on the door, he was there. I turned towards the open street light, and saw him. Not even a foot behind Christie. Before I could say anything He and Christie were both gone. I didn't wait to find out why. I took off, James at my side. ""The fuck you runnin' for?"" I didn't answer. I just wanted I be gone from there. I ran until I got to the 24 hour gas station, and ran inside. James, Lys, and Evan followed shortly. ""What happened to the others?"" I asked. No one knew. I spoke to the clerk, and he let us sleep for a while in the back room. What only seemed like minutes later, he was back saying we had to leave, his shift was over. We did leave, and since dawn was breaking, we headed back to my apartment. Both doors were unlocked. I tell what's left of the group to find a spot to crash, and I go check Mikes room. Empty, just as he left from the night before. I come back out, and I'm alone. I search the entire apartment, and only find one thing that was out of place. A note. Pinned to the fridge by magnet. On it were 9 crudely drawn stick figures, with a large open area at the center, and an empty corner. I ran. But I knew it was futile.",,False,self,t5_2st64,False,,,True,t3_zlya3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SlenderMan/comments/zlya3/it_was_only_supposed_to_be_a_joke/,

He was the son of a taylor and suffered since childhood from Marfan syndrome.

During Primary School, he never suffered any kind of bullying from his peers. In fact, they liked the curious boy with his long arms. Still, his disease kept him from practicing sports and he missed the social interaction.

When Arthur entered a new school for Secondary School, it all changed. He was the butt of many jokes. He was called ""Slender Man"" by the other boys. He became a social misfit and befriending only one other kid, Thomas Green. Thomas' interest in ocultism and witchcraft made him a social misfit as well. He would later have a big role in Arthur's life.

In 1929, at the age of 20, Arthur still lived with his parents. He had no friends, no job, and his days would consist of watching little kids play at the local park. He felt they were the only one who would not judge him because of his looks, and missed his own childhood.

In 1932, two kids were found dead at the park. Luke, 5, and his brother Jack, 7, were brutally beaten to death. The autopsy also revealed they were raped. The local population imediatly suspected the weird, shady man that spent his days looking at the local kids at that same park. Arthur was arrested.

In prison, he was constantly beaten and raped by the other cellmates, who saw him as a child molester and an infanticide. He again was called ""Slender Man"".

Arthur spent 2 months in prison until the real criminal was arrested. He was released, but the psychological damage was already done. Also, he still carried the social stigma of a pedophile.

In the years that came, Arthur became blinder and blinder because of Marfan syndrome. His only joy was to look at the children playing. If he lose that, he could not live.

He turned to his old friend, Thomas Green, seeking magical help. In the weeks that followed, he moved to his friend's house.

Arthur spent 7 years without being seen, until his dead body was found at the park. His eyes, nostrils and mouth were shut, and no one could open them, even with a scapel. His skin was pale, even for a cadaver.

Thomas Green was found at his house, in state of shock. He was taken to the local police station, where he became silent for 4 hours until he said the words ""Arthur ain't between us no more. He became a Slender Man"" before commiting suicide biting his own tongue.

Harry Sly, Arthur's father, made a manequin that had long members like his son, and dressed him with a suit he made during Arthur's disappearance, hoping to give it to his son one day. In the day after the manequin was complete and dressed, it disappeared.

In the following months, two facts shocked the little town.

The first one: notes appeared at the park, with messages such as ""You can't run away"". No mather how many times they were rippen off, they would appear at the next day at the same place. The people who had ripped them would start to show paranoic behavior. The ones who kept the notes, even more.

The second one: kids would start to cry to their parents about a weird, tall guy in a suit with long arms and legs that stalked them at the park. The adults saw nothing, but had to give creddit to their childern when this same ""boggeyman"" apeared at photos taken at the park. Worse than that. The same kids who saw the misterious man started to disappear.

The park was declared off-limits, and a fence was put around it. Every year, groups of teenager break into the park, never to be seen again

By himself, you'll barely be able to see him in his 9 foot glory, however I'm going to set up a flash or something in the back yard to backlight him every couple of minutes just for a split second.

Here's where I need help: How should I go about building such nightmare fuel? Here's what I'm thinking so far.

* a trip down to goodwill to pick up a black suit; we can modify it from there to extend the legs and sleeves. I'll be dark so it doesn't have to be perfect.
* white paint and paper mache, for the head. This will be fairly trickey; perhaps do it over a balloon?
* my lovely wife suggested pool noodles for the arms (perhaps shaped by some galvanized wire inside)

This however leaves me without legs and a torso, which is kind of important.  Any suggestions or thoughts?

Late one night, after dropping off his girlfriend, he decided to visit the park. The sun was setting and the park was empty except for the warm glow of the sunlight. He walked around and began to head home. Shivering, he looked around, the horrible feeling of being watched engulfed him in a dizzy flurry. He saw a tall man across from him, whom of which was smiling madly. Stepping back he peered closely. That wasn't a smile but simply a shadow.

Well, I went to the to the bathroom to relieve myself and then I turned off the light and go to open the bedroom door where we had been playing Nintendo. It was locked and I was standing in total darkness.
 My brother was playing a trick on me. Since it was a new house and I was young I couldn't find a light switch. I distinctly remember looking down the the stairs and there was a faint light coming in from a street light. All the sudden I saw a tall slender shadow that seemed to be watching me. I instinctively started crying and banging on the door and walls. My mother rushed out into the hallway yelling at my brother a phrase that still haunts me, ""Something could've gotten your brother!"" She was hysterical and I told her what I saw.

Of ghosts and ghouls,

But no other story,

Is as frightening,

As the man in the woods.

“He wore a suit and tie,

His body; tall and thin,

His arms were long and his face, expressionless” they said.

“They call him Slender Man”.

I laughed at the ridiculous thought.

A man hiding in the woods,

Of unnatural appearance.

I made a plan to come in the woods,

To prove these fools wrong.

----------------

In the woods,

There are notes placed,

Saying to run and hide.

I found one that said,

“He’s watching you”.

I am terrified.

I wonder “who would do this to me?”

------------------

In the woods,

A tall man hides,

Behind the trees,

Is where the stalker lies.

Once I saw him,

I started to run.

Then, all I could see was static all over.

They say they never saw me again.

---------------------

Before he took me,

I was able to leave a few notes behind,

Warning people to run and hide.

I have never been so scared in my entire life. I mean, I tried to ignore the signs, but it’s just too overwhelming! The warnings, my dreams, the myths, everything! I suppose I should start from the beginning of it all, though.

I was an average guy, just going by on his normal day. I had been aiming to delve my skills into writing, considering most people said I had a knack for it. I was about 5”10 and was a Caucasian, with medium-length, dark brown hair. I was pretty into computers and creepy horror stories, so it was only right I was curious about… Slenderman. I was home one day watching TV when I became bored. I pulled out my laptop and quickly logged onto Facebook, checking to see if any friends were online or if I had any notifications. Seeing none, I put my earbuds in and went to YouTube. Checking my 50 or so subscriptions, I came across one of them playing Slender. Curious as to what it was, I Googled it, and came across the download. 

After scanning it for viruses, and finding none, I proceeded to download the game. I waited for the pesky download time to finish, installed it, and started up the game.

I managed to collect about 4 pages on my first run through, and when I saw him, I had to find out more. Excited about this mysterious figure, I once again used Google to find out the myths about him. I came across several myths and “Eye-witness accounts” through my searching, along with other things, including several video series on YouTube documenting encounters of Slenderman. I also managed to find several documentaries of Slenderman, using old wood-carvings and black-and-white photos to prove his existence. People would generally describe being a slim man, with very long arms. He always wore a black business suit,  and had a totally white head, no nose, no mouth, no eyes. Some others would say he could stretch his arms at different lengths at will, and could grow black tentacles.

At thas point, I honestly wasn’t sure whether or not to believe in the myths. On one hand, I had a large amount of photos and accounts of him to convince myself that he was real. On the other, a huge coincidence or misconception of photos, possibly purposely faked. I decided to keep on the “I want to believe he’s real, but I don’t think there’s enough evidence” side. 

A few weeks later, I was still into Slenderman. I delved deeper into the Slender phenomenon. I started doing art of him, reading fan fiction about him, heck, I wrote a fan fiction about him. I kept seeing these “I have seen him, help me!” posts on different forums I joined. I mostly tried to convince myself they were people having a go at trying to write something, but there was always a voice in the back my head, saying “You know, there’s always a possibility…” 

Another thing about the myths, they warned people. They said that Slenderman only comes to people who are afraid, people who believe that he is coming for them. Whenever someone asked me about Slenderman, I would always say some thing like “Meh… he’s kinda scary.” On the inside, I was terrified. I don’t know why I kept going back to Slender, but something compelled me to. Almost like I had to. I kept reading all the stuff about him, and then, I dreamt about him. 

At first, I was even more terrified! Another myth said that when you dream about him, that means at some point, someplace, sometime, he will come for you. After about three days, I managed to calm down, since nothing had happened. But the dreams, they became recurring. Every night, it would be the same. Me running for my life, stumbling as I do so. I trip on a sideways twig, or an aloft rock. I fall on my butt, and turn around to face it. It stands there, no expression on it’s face. Then, it slowly reaches it’s hand towards me, and I reach mine to him. We slowly come closer until we are just about to touch. Then, I wake up.

Always in a cold sweat, dizzy and nauseous, breathing heavily. I have no idea what time it is, or what day of the week it is. Finally, after about two weeks of dreams, they stop. I decide to finally stop with everything about Slenderman. I stopped going on the forums, reading fan fiction, and I even deleted everything Slenderman-related on my computer. I was finally rid of him, or so I thought..

About three weeks later, I was walking through my neighborhood, lost in thought. I was trying to decide what to write about next, considering I was all out of ideas. I stopped and sat up on a nearby wall, trying to quickly brainstorm an idea. I decided that it could be worked on later, so I started to get ready to walk again. As I hopped off the wall and back onto the sidewalk, I randomly scanned some houses. There, I saw him. A tall, slim man, wearing a black business suit, with no face. Tentacles slowly waving in the air, presumably protruding out of his back.

Struck with panic and fear, I immediately started sprinting back towards my apartment, receiving complaints from other people on the street. I ignored them, only focusing on getting home. 

I arrived back at my apartment, and hastily pulled out my key. I jammed it in the lock, cranked the lock, and slammed into my home. I closed the door behind me, locking it as well. I ran around my house frantically trying to close all the blinds and seal all the windows. I managed to succeed in doing so, probably breaking a personal best. I yanked my laptop into my hands and flipped it open, opening Microsoft works. 

And, here I am now. As I said, I am extremely scared. As of right now, I can hear faint whispers coming from nowhere. I’m positive that was him, and seeing him can only mean one thing. 

I'm next.

Not some ghost or... paranormal being, no, he was real, and he'd been around for longer thn we had. I could hear him, not a human voice, an...alienated whisper, calling out to me, becoming louder and louder, echoing off the trees.

I dropped, the pounding in my ears, the tears in my eyes, the shivers running down my spine... they all came at once. The agony, a sharp pain in my head with every beat. My legs extended until i was standning tall.

I was turning, i willed my bod not to, but it was futile,  was under his control. His face... wasn't there, but yet he was staring at me, not at my face, but, into me. He was... perfect in a way, no flaws in his face.

I was paralysed, he was reaching out to me... and in that instant that his hand reached my shoulder... the fear... the pure fear, seeping through my veins... The cool touch of his hand wasnt just skin deep, but ran deep down into my heart

He whispered to me... a quiet sound, but it was a audible as a siren inside my head, that word... that one word... I hear it when i sleep, but i do not dream... i only see his face.

No one believed me, but why would they?, would you? they thought i was insane, a fucking... blabbering mental case... but I've seen him, he comes to me every night, not hereto hurt me, no, he just stands in the corner of my padded room.

I scream... every night... but they dont come anymore, i would beg them to stay with me... but they would leave... and he would come.

Humans were born soon after and the Slenderman tried to befriend them, they were afraid of it. So it shapeshifted into what he thought looked like a human, which made them even more afraid.

Superintendent Paul Reardon: Gotcha Willhelm, keep looking. Search the cabin, too.

A: Derek here did pick up a strange looking leaf of notepaper on the ground, though.

P: Is it relevant?

A: Possibly. Its mostly torn up but i can make out a circle with a cross through it. Sir, whoever drew this was really forcing it. Some of the tearing is along the pen lines and its all... Deep in the paper, y'know?

P: Noted. Did you find anything else?

[muffled noises, voices from far away]

A: Two more of these pages, sir. Not with the circle and cross, though. Peterson's has a kind of stick figure in the centre. Riley's has a row of five smaller stick figures, but with the heads coloured in.

P: Colored in?

A: Yeah. Peterson's picture has a stick figure with a white head, but the others are coloured in completely.

[a man shouting]

A: Hold on, sir. Looks like Riley's found something else.

[rustling footsteps, some chatter, increasing static]

A: Sir... Sir, we've found the bodies.

P: Bodies?

A: They're... Sir, i don't know what to say... They're up in a tree.

P: Detective Willhelm, can you repeat that?

A: They're [static] tree... Riley only [static] dripped onto his head.

P: Detective, the line is breaking up, please move somewhere i can hear you.

A: Okay sir, I'm back at the cabin- Wait, Peterson! Peterson!

[muffled chatter between two men]

A: But who was that? Did you see him? No, he was... Never mind. Sir are you there?

I was being driven home late by my dad and had my right elbow propped against the window with my forehead pressed against the glass watching the ground travel quickly by. Suddenly the face of an old man standing up from a crouch and looking me right in the face. I reeled back from the window in shock and had a very upsetting feeling in my stomach. My dad who had *seen what had happened* said he agreed that it was ""weird"".(my dad witnessed it so I know I wasn't just having an odd head. 

At this point I'll mention I did not have any drugs so i was not hallucinating on anything. 

Later, i go up to my room and lay down (bed next to the window). I glance out the blinds just to look down the street for the old man. At this point it's around 2am and I notice something odd about the street lamp at the end of my court. It's off.....the only streetlamp in the whole neighborhood is - suddenly it turns on. But not yellow like the other lights, first it turns to bright white ""fluorescent"". Then it slowly dims to yellow again after 30seconds(exactly, I counted.) and then off again, for another 30seconds. 

What's more concerning to me, and what i have been watching for the past half hour at this point is the smooth liquidlike black object which appears to be ""phasing"" in and out of the ground with a motion like oil. **right under the street lamp**.

I had read the Slenderman story for the first time two days ago and the very  sarcastic fear was fresh in my mind. I thought it would remain sarcastic. Whatever it was in the street had a small light in the center. It looked EXACTLY like a cell phone light...which im sure it was...but then *why was it pointed towards me* if someone were searching for something they would need to point it at the ground. And even then the street light was turning on frequently, they shouldnt need it at all.

After watching this 'shape' move so oddly in a way I couldnt wrap my head around I finally broke from my trance and shut the blinds, laid down, and tried to sleep. Some number of minutes later, i woke with a start and decided to look out the window again. 

The moment I moved the blinds aside, I saw someone *just* making it to the curb, sprinting at full speed. I looked just in time to see theyre legs in mid stride *sprint* around the corner. 

From even before that day I have been haunted by street lamps. ***every*** single time I go out at night at least one street lamp will turn off the moment I step under it, many of my friends can verify that its *extremely* peculiar and none have an explanation for it. 

Disclaimer: All of these facts are true. I do not claim to have seen slenderman, but ever since that day(or at least until the game came out) I sincerely believed in him.

The creature you see come out is a demon. He comes out with his head facing down. The eyes light up. There are clearly eyes.

I was already a little creeped out, since the last customer was a very tall, skinny, older gentleman who  looked like he was had just come from a job interview. He was wearing a tight, black suit, white shirt and a tie so dark, I had a hard time tearing my eyes away from it to look the customer in the eye. His small crown of gray hair was cut close, and he seemed to have no qualms about his baldness. He spoke quietly, which would usually annoy me, but somehow I was able to hear him clearly over the sounds of my restaurant. All together, this was very very strange for a customer coming in at nearly midnight.

The restaurant shut down after him, and I worked slowly in cleaning up the dining room. Something about that man left me uneasy, and I found it very difficult to focus. I had been waiting to see him drive off, but there were no cars to be seen anywhere. Instead of getting out early, which I usually do, I had used up nearly all the time I had been scheduled by the time I finished, which really annoyed my manager. He's one of those people who thinks that the extra $3 I made in using all the time I had been scheduled was theft from his store. I wish I were joking.

As I was walking out the door, I felt a chill run down my spine. At the time, I thought it was the evil look my manager gave me, but now I'm not so certain.

My route home takes me through Rosewood Park, three blocks away from where I work, and two blocks from my apartment. The park is your standard small town park, with a playground on the north end where families can take their kids. The south part is thickly wooded and filled with trails. I much prefer the south part, as some of the trails lead past some very beautiful spots on the creek. 

I had considered not walking through the park, as a child had gone missing there a week before. But it was cold and I didn't want to walk the extra several blocks around the park. 

As soon as I spotted the entrance I always used, I felt another chill go down my spine. I reconsidered walking around the park again, but it was getting colder and the wind was starting to pick up. I thought the woods would give me some shelter. 

I almost ran into the woods, as a gust at my back seemed to push me in. I walked at a brisk pace, simply hoping my imagination was just acting up again. 

The wind died off as I rounded the first corner. Looking up, I spotted a what looked like a white orb through the woods. “Just an owl in the moonlight,” I thought to myself as the image of the older gentleman forced itself into my mind. When I looked away, I felt the chills again.

“Now you're just being paranoid,” I had to keep telling myself. I needed to get home. Once I was home, I would be safe and the dark thoughts would go away. Why am I being paranoid? I'm never this paranoid.

The paved path I was on was a long and winding one. I remembered that a smaller, dirt path was coming up and would lead more directly home. It was one I had taken earlier that day to get to work, so I felt I would be safe using it. I just had to remember the downed tree at the end of the path near where the park ended. 

The wind rustling the trees around me and my footsteps were all that I could hear until I reached the large beech tree which marked the entrance to the trail through the woods. I stopped for a second and thought that I would just stay on the wide paved trail. The silly thoughts I was having made me a bit afraid to be so close to the trees and underbrush. I decided against the dirt path and took a step farther along the paved path. 

Nope.

The same chill I had felt earlier ran down my spine again. The woods it is, then.

I turned back and saw the owl out of the corner of my eye. It hadn't moved. No, it hadn't. No, it wasn't following me. No, I'll get home fast, and get home safe. Get a hold on yourself. How could an owl come and get me? 

I almost ran down the dirt trail. What was happening to me? I'm never this scared, especially in this park. This is my park. This is my safe spot. It was other people who would set off my anxiety. It was why I hated my job, having to talk to people all day. I hated them. This was my safe spot. This was my park. Nothing bad could possibly happen to me here. I know there was that kid, but that was in the other part of the park. That wasn't me. That wasn't anything that could happen to me. I'm safe here. I'm safe here. I'm safe here. I need to get home!

The wind stopped. The noise of insects stopped. Even the small whisper from the creek not ten yards from where I was walking could be heard. All I could hear was quiet ring of silence. Not even my feet were making noise as I walked along the dirt trail. 

The underbrush was closing in around me. I could feel the bushes as I pushed past them, but they didn't seem to make any noise. I began to see my breath clouding in front of me. I didn't realize it was that cold. 

I barely noticed the big, split oak tree as I rushed past. It meant I was about a third of the way through the path. After that would be the grove of popplers with the boulder in the middle. I would be two thirds of the way through and I would be back in the city proper. After that, two more blocks and I'd be home. 

I kept moving quickly, feeling the sweat build under my coat. The cold around me seemed to deepen. The combination felt almost like a fever. Such strange thoughts. I'll be home soon. I'll be safe soon. 

Then the chills came again. I'm getting sick. That's all. That's all. I'll make myself some soup when I get home. I'll call into work and get lots of sleep. I'll be fine. I'm just being silly.

I saw the grove ahead as my dirt path forked. The left side would take me home, and the right side ran straight into the grove. I could see the boulder, right in the middle of the path. The owl was sitting on it.  No, that's not quite right. The owl is too high to be on the boulder. It's on a branch. There's no branch there, though. No, you're just being silly. That's a branch. That's... Oh, Ghawd! It's a person! 

I ran.

I ran down the left fork as fast as I could manage. The cold was biting my face and burning my lungs, but I ran. I ran as fast as I could. Images of the gentleman flooded my mind. His slender frame, his pale skin, his creepy presence. I kept running. 

I should have remembered the downed tree. I should have jumped over it and been on my way. But I didn't. I tripped and face-planted right onto where my dirt path joined back up with the paved one. 

I wanted to cry. I could feel that I had busted open my lip, my nose was bleeding, and my hands were scraped up and stung so bad. 

For half a second, I lay there, wanting to cry and be done. Wanting to stew in the misery of my paranoid mind and how it had caused me to hurt myself so badly. But the chills came again. I pushed myself up, almost screaming at the pain in my hands. It felt as though my shin were bleeding as well. 

When I was up, I saw the exit of the park ahead. The glow of streetlights was only twenty yards away. I could make it, and get home and clean myself up. There was no way I was going to work tomorrow looking like this.

I glanced back and saw the person from the grove. His tall, slender frame with his nearly white head was coming towards me. I panicked and turned, trying to run and not scream at the pain it caused in my busted open shin. The chills would not go away. 

I was getting closer to the street. I could make it. I would make it. Don't turn around. He's right behind you. Don't turn around! 

I made it. 

I ran to stand under the nearest streetlight to catch my breath. I was about ten yards away from the entrance to the park. 

The man was standing in the park entrance I had just run from. His arms and legs seemed grotesquely long and thin. He looked like he was wearing a suit, like the gentleman I had served earlier. His face was almost featureless in the light, but it was clearly bright white. 

I made what I figured was eye contact, although I couldn't see his eyes, and I felt a deep sense of pity come from him. It almost seemed as though he hadn't wanted me hurt. 

I heard a car drive past the cross street behind me. I turned to look at it, toward home two blocks away. I needed to get there. When I turned back to look at the park, the man had turned back and was walking back into the park. 

I shook the panic from me and started to feel the pain of my injuries. I was going to need to see a doctor tomorrow. 

As I started to limp toward home, I caught the sound of a child's giggle from the park. I thought I also heard the sound of “Tag! You're it!”",,False,self,t5_2st64,False,,,True,t3_120np8,http://www.reddit.com/r/SlenderMan/comments/120np8/tag_youre_it/,

Ya know, like the dark? Or ghosts? Or garden ornaments? Or anything like that? Just that sorta stuff that keeps you awake at night, or keeps you looking around corners; being all cautious and stuff. I even have a friend, Jordan, who’s afraid of stairs (just going down, not up). She told me it was because when she was little, around 7 or 8 years old, she was running down her stairs on Christmas Day and one of the steps broke and she fell down the rest of the staircase.
 

I think these fears all come from things that happened to us in the past. It could be stories that we’ve heard or things that we’ve really experienced. During youth group one day, we all sat around a campfire and talked about out little fears and I noticed that most come from experiences, but some just come from stories that we have been told as kids.
 

I had a grandmother. I used to visit her when my family went on vacation in Montana every summer. Her house was placed in a really wooded area, which was pretty nice; nice little country house, great place to play Hide ‘n Seek inside and outside the house. I loved visiting her when I could. She always told the greatest stories, next to my Uncle Bobby. She used to tell me this ghost story that has been passed down through our family for about a century now. I was around the age of 3 or 4 when she started telling me the story. It was about a man, but he wasn’t really.
 

Mr. Skinny.
 

Mr. Skinny was an abnormal man. He was very, very tall, about 7 feet, but his height got taller every time my grandmother told the story. He was also as skinny as a flagpole. He walked around in a black business suit and tie, with a white dress shirt on underneath. His skin was also as white as snow and he was bald. But ya know the things that frightened me the most about him?
 

He had no face, just a blank, featureless face. My grandma also told me that he had many arms, but that varied between each story, too. She also called them tentacles in some stories. She told me he used his extra arms to carry his victims with, but years later she told me they were used to harm them.
 

He used to live in the woods, far in the woods. He would follow his victims home sometimes. He also found ways into their houses and even watched them sleep. The sight of him caused his victims to have anxiety and paranoia in many different forms. His frightening silence and looming body just found a way into their hearts in such a terrifying way that they couldn’t explain. It drove them insane very, very slowly.
 

 My grandmother passed away two years ago in a house fire. The cause of the fire was never really explained. Some say it was because she left the stove on. I pretty much believe that that was the case, because she used to be so forgetful. A year before, she told me the story in the most terrifying way. She told me that he stood 9 feet tall and loomed over you like a street light. And he had eight long, black-as-night tentacles coming out of his back. His fingers were as long as full-grown carrots. She told me that he used his tentacles to hurt his victims in horrible ways.
 

Horrible, horrible ways.
 

  She said that he used them to rip out his victims’ organs and put them in plastic bags and hung them from trees. He would stand inside the victims’ rooms, in their closets, in their doorway, and even looming over them while they slept.
 

That was the last time she ever told me that story.
 

Ever since, that story has given me that creepy-crawly feeling that made me look around corners and kept me up some nights. This is my one fear that is probably going to stay with me for a long, long time. It’s just something about the last time she told me the story that just terrifies me. It really made me feel like it all really happened. I jump every time I see an unexpected shadow move. I’m surprised I even went out into the forest with my youth group to go camping.
 

I have actually caught myself drawing him on paper at school and at home. I’d have to tell you: the image is pretty creepy. Sometimes I imagine him standing in my closet and outside my window when I’m lying in bed. Sometimes I feel like he’s actually there.

EDIT!!!!!!! serious quetion...Who wants a sneak peek?




SNEAK PEEK!!!!! its from un unedited, un spellchecked draft, so be nice.....As he looked at the man’s face, he noticed his tie, black, but with a bit of red now. The red seemed to ooze out from the top, as if it were bleeding. Suddenly long thick tentacles seemed to peel right out of the man, as if unrolling from inside him. They were long, and wispy looking. Like they were made of smoke, but they also seemed to be dripping something. They didn’t look entirely solid, they looked like condensed smoke. The man lifted his arms, and reached out to the kids. The tentacles waving slowly through the air towards the kids, reaching around behind them. The man bent at the waist, lowered his head down closes to the group of kids. The kids were surrounded by the tentacles. The man wrapping them up, pulling them tight to him. His tie was now a solid red colour. He was still looking at Kyle, and then he tilted his head to the side. Kyle blinked. When his eyes opened the kid’s and the man had disappeared.  The ringing and the nausea stopped. Kyle and James stood there, frozen in place, scare, confused.

So I compared them to each other, and yes they are the same, [here I made a gif about it](http://i.imgur.com/pCoq37l.gif).

The following is my theory, i am just thinking out loud, so if you read (is, was, etc put in your mind this is just a theory, so transfer it to: probably is, was,etc.) My theory:
Slender-Man is real. Or at least i think so, NO, NO, I KNOW SO. I just watched a video (from this subreddit) which happens to be a documentary about slender-man, and the guy was recorded on tape, (the voice,not video) and he got two victims. So my theory simply suggests that Slender-Man's existence is a reality. I tend to believe anything on the internet so it's probably just a paranoia. But to me, Slender-Man is a goddamn reality. I was writing a story where this special (not retarded  but with super-powers) sees slender-man and is not scared of him, because he has the power to kill him, and any other monster, and other cool powers as well! So slender-man doesnt kill him because Jason ( the name of the kid) complimented his suit the first time he saw him, and he can talk to slender-man with his mind, it's funny and is hard work for me but probably crappy for you. I dont know from where this idea came to me, it just came! 
So, another part of my theory is that Slender ( the game) is haunted by slender-man, so if you die in it, he comes to kill you or you see him, which eventually leads to him killing you, so yeah, you die in both cases, that's why i'm afraid to play slender.
Also another part of my theory is that if you keep searching for info about him, and wanting to know even more, he will come and kill you. Yes, kill you. 
My theory probably doesnt make sense to you, but it does to me, paranoia maybe, but since quite a few paranormal stuff happened to me, it does make sense to me. 
Also, ( i repeat) if you want to ask me anything feel free to. 
AND thank you for reading my long pointless and sense-less theory.

You shouldn’t have wandered so far from the rest, but don’t fret- You will all be together soon.

Hide and seek, you say? Why yes, I do believe that is a wonderful game for children to play in woods. 

Run! Run! Hide….

I know you can feel me near, I see you check over your shoulder and peer deeper into the trees. Do you think you can find me so easily? 
The tension is thick in the autumn air as you try not to laugh and give away your hiding place. Don’t worry little one, I won’t tell.
You jump a little when you spot my shadow out of the corner of your eye; you laugh at yourself for being so scared and try hard to ignore the snapping of twigs that grow ever closer, I can tell you are praying very hard for me to be a friend and not a foe. 

I think you have seen me as you are running now, as fast as your frightened legs can carry you; do you know I will catch you in the end? Your calls for help have roused the other children from their hiding spots. I see you pointing to where I used to be. 

Where we used to be. 

Hiding in tall roots of a tree.

Their laughter drifts towards me, do they not believe you little one? They will soon. The night is closing in and I am alone with you all.
You stray to the back of the group, relaxed in larger numbers now, still wary of where I might be. The tall man, you called me, the tall man in black.

I cannot wait any longer little one; Your fear is overwhelmingly delicious and I am so excited to have you all in my woods!
My arms are long, impossibly so- I think that’s why you scream at first.

Some try to run, some try to hide, but it is too late and I have you now. They watch on as I stand tall, so very tall and embrace you. 

They cannot run little one, their legs are frozen in fear.

Soon little one, your company shall arrive.

Then the cold, black tendrils engulfing me and bringing me to the hell that I now know as my current existence.
I don't quite remember how it happened. All I know is that it did. And here is where I am, and where I shall remain until the day I die. For all I know, I'm already dead. But I have the feeling that being dead would be much more peaceful than where I am now, even if I did go to Hell, or wherever sinners, and other non-religious people apparently go.
Oh no. Please, no. He's back. He has come back for me. He knows I know who he is, and he wants to keep me quiet. He never says anything. Just his presence is enough to make me do his bidding; this he knows. He approaches me with his bizarre mobility. It seems as if his feet do not touch the ground, as if he drifts.
He reaches where I cringe, his grotesque body hovering above me. This seems to please him. I cannot see his face, although I believe he smiles. I feel his sadistic grin. He feeds on my paranoia; it's as if it gives him power and energy. He reaches out with one of his arms. It's not human; he is not human. His arms are cold and many. They seem to be tentacles almost. He brushes my cheek lightly.
His very being, I know, is the embodiment of my impending death. His black suit makes me think of the horror he makes myself and so many others endure. He is quiet demeanor is horrific and his slender ways paralyzing. I do not know how he has been able to do what he does for so long; playing on the fear and paranoia of those who know, taking advantage of the naivety of his victims.
But it angers me.
I am envenomed to know how he preys upon people, and even more so to have let myself become one of them. But no more. Not again. No one shall ever have to encounter the mental agony he has put me through.

1360385423.0,5,self.SlenderMan,186eve,A theory...[for entertainment purposes only. This is just a piece of literature as far as I am concerned],Maodawg,7,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SlenderMan/comments/186eve/a_theoryfor_entertainment_purposes_only_this_is/,"The Slender Man is not an archetypal being. He is physical the result of emotion so strong that you and I cannot even imagine the anger that he felt. Anger that results only from such trauma, such hate that you and I cannot imagine what he felt. Most people exhibit fear after a traumatic experience. They may be angry deep down, but dare not express that anger in life due to a deep-seated fear that the source of the trauma will come back in retaliation. (I know that sounds far fetched, but many exhibit fear immediately after their experience, and anger sets in after they have overcome their fears and have realized that they can be angry.) This entity did not have that luxury. The Slender Man did not have the luxury of having the period to get over his fears. He did not have the luxury of even feeling that much fear in the final hours of his short life. The Slender Man goes after children mostly. Why children? Well what is the most outstanding quality of a child? Innocence. The one reason anyone would have a qualm with such a remarkable human trait is because they are jealous. They wouldn't hate the innocence of a child for any other reason, because there is no other reason to hate the innocence of a child because it is beautiful, other than that they cannot have it. This leads to the question: Why is the Slender Man jealous of the beauty of the innocence of a child? The obvious reason would be that he does not have that innocence. But this still does not add up. Most beings grow up as human, and spend their lives as adults relatively content. Sure, we may feel some jealousy of the innocence of a child, but it is not  intense because we've already had it. So perhaps Slender Man never had that chance for innocence. Maybe he didn't have a childhood. Maybe it was stripped from him. But how? We're assuming his childhood was cut short, and that he is dead because he is exhibiting abilities that no living being could do. However many children die yet almost none become like Slender Man. So why did he become the way he was? Well, perhaps his death wasn't as normal as other's deaths. I imagine he was a vibrant child, and strong spirited and strong willed. One of those children that had he grown up could have been a great leader or artist. Always exploring, thinking, rebelling even at a young age. What is the most traumatic way for a child to lose his/her life, or what is it that can strip a child of innocence quickly like a bandaid from a leg wound, and leave them a cold shell of their original selves? What could make the entity known as Slender Man so angry that when he died he became what we know him as today? His life must have been cut short in the most evil way possible. I imagine that he died a painful death at the hands of an abuser, who did horrible things to him before his eventual slow and painful death. My theory is that the face of the abuser and his actions made him so full of rage instead of fear due to his strong spirit. His anger was so strong that when his body died his spirit lived on. His appearance can easily be explained by using some of the above information. Symbolically where does one see the innocence of a child most? The face. When a child gets a twinkle in his eye or smiles at you you feel fuzzy inside knowing that he is still growing up, learning about a world that must seem so wonderful to him/her. Many people would agree that nothing is more beautiful than the look of a happy child. Even an adult face still preserves some of that happiness. In every human being there is the root of happiness in innocence at birth, where even when you grow old and see a bad world you know that it isn't all bad and so there is still good and happiness inside of yourself. Slender Man, once again did not have that luxury. His innocence was stripped of him to the point that nothing in the world seemed good to him anymore. There was no happiness left for him. There was no light. Only darkness. And thus his face is nonexistent because there is no more happiness for him. While even the adult face has some innocence left, he cannot have a face because he does not have innocence anymore. Why is he tall and why does he wear a suit? Simply because of the same reasons as listed above. The dark suit and his height represent overmaturity over a very short period of time, like he grew up too fast by witnessing the horrors of his death, and his innocence was stripped away. The final question must of course be answered as well: Why children? Why anyone? Why would he do this to people? Many people who are supposedly victims of the Slender Man  are either found mutilated or never seen again. I can speak for those who are mutilated. I imagine that those who are never seen again are killed body and soul and cease to exist. This doesn't mean their soul lives on, it means that it dies with the body and does not function spiritually on any plane of existence. As for those who are found, and the children, the reason is simple: He wants happiness. He wants to love or to be loved but he can't. He kills for this reason. He hates us for what we are. He knows he can never be like us ever again, and lives on in agony and hatred, and all he can do is kill us. Perhaps he even tries to get the innocence of his victims by harming their soul? I don't know. But I do know that he is angry beyond repair. The hatred he exhibits is beyond reversal and he knows it. When he sees us his envy flairs up and he hurts us. He doesn't do it too often because he wants his existence secret and not known to the population. He doesn't want a manhunt on his hands, or defenses being built. He also doesn't want to run out of ""fresh meat."" He kills because of envy, he lives because of hatred, he has no face, because he has no innocence.

I peered out of the door and called my sister's name.
""Amanda, this isn't funny."" I called out scared. The only response I got was a rustle coming from the edge of the woods. I shined flashlight to where the noise came from just in time to see a figure disappear into the woods. I took off towards the woods.

Noah from TT has appeared in EH and DH00.

The EH crew has appeared in TT.

Both plots from TT and DH00 have been tied together with the cult that worships Slenderman. EH has yet to tie itself into either story line (as far as I know).

Before he even starts playing I try to leave the room (not a big fan of scary things). Well he makes me watch him play and when slenderman's face pops up on the screen I nearly piss myself. 
Well fast forward to later that night. Me and my friend are driving around smoking pot in his neighborhood, which is surrounded densely by trees and is very dark. At the apex of our highs, who do we see lurking beside a house...our good friend Slendy.

I have taken photos of the building where I saw the creature, and also a pic of one of the stolen items. (An Xbox mic. When it was found, it was inside my guitar case and had a hole in it)
Also, when I went to the building to take the photos, I felt very unwelcome and got a feeling of nausea. When I got home and sat down to post this, I forgot how I had even gotten home. 
Last night, I heard murmuring and movement outside my window... I quickly forced myself to sleep. It almost sounded like something was humming, yet trying to say, *""I care...""*
I don't know what is going on, but here is the photos I was asked for. Please read my other story... I need as many opinions as possible before something happens to me...

1342966280.0,5,self.SlenderMan,wyt2b,The face that watches (A second story I have written for our Tall friend),marabear2685,5,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SlenderMan/comments/wyt2b/the_face_that_watches_a_second_story_i_have/,"There’s a strange face in the woods outside my window. Mum and Dad won’t listen though. It stares and stares… Little brother hates hearing it about it. He thinks it is meant to scare him, the story about the man with no face. 

The face watches me all hours of the night and day…
 
Big sister says that it is all lies; she says that Mum and dad should call in head doctors.

It doesn’t matter how many times I tell them about him, the man in the dark, no one listens. I don’t like when Mum says I have to play outside, because I have to be close to him- he is too tall. He is too thin. Like he doesn’t eat!

The man doesn’t move when he watches me, he just makes me cold, makes it so I can’t run. I don’t like when he is around and I think I should stay away from the fence. Mum has to drag me inside for dinner because I can’t stop staring, she is angry at me for being out so late in the cold, can’t she see him? The tall man that is now standing in our yard.

After dinner tonight, Mum is making me sit in my room- no TV- because I didn’t come when she called. I sit at my desk with my homework, trying to finish it before Dad comes in to check, when I see him standing in the yard. The man without a face; the tall man, standing to close to my window. He is always there now, even when I point him out to mum and dad; I don’t know why they can’t see him.
My dreams are full of him now, he is standing in the background as I do real magic for my friends. He stands in my dreams watching, I have told him to leave me alone, but only in my dreams. 
	                         
                                             ---------------------

Mum called the doctor today, she says I am very sick, I keep coughing up blood and I can’t sleep. She says I’m not eating very much, she tells him of the tall man I see, I don’t think it matters anymore. The doctor says I might need to go to hospital, he says that maybe something is wrong with my brain and I will need scans. The coughing is bad now, it hurts a lot, the tall man is still watching.

Mum sits with me in the night time to make sure I am ok, she asks me what I am humming and I can’t tell her. I don’t know the words, I didn’t even know I was humming. She tucks me in and kisses my head, the tall man isn’t outside my window anymore. He hasn’t been there for a whole day, but he is still in my dreams. His long, long arms reaching for me.

The music is loud in my ears, I can see mum reading to me- her lips are moving- but the music is so loud. I cough and cough, lots of blood come up this time. She sits on the end of my bed staring at me, waiting for it to stop, but it doesn’t. I wish it would because I need to tell her something…

The tall man isn’t outside the window anymore, the tall man isn’t in the yard, he isn’t even in the woods…

The coughing is too much and I feel like I am falling asleep… I try to fight it very hard because I need mummy to know…
The tall man is the corner now… He is in my room…

*January 10th: Being on house arrest isn't so bad when you've got a broadband connection. It gives me movies, video games, news and wall to wall smut. Everything a young man needs except for basic human contact but between you and me dear readers human contact is overrated.*

*That's right friends and readers it's your old pal Brian Foster, I'm back again and no one is more surprised than me. I was sure that after the events of the Graveyard Game my goose was cooked and I didn't really care if they locked me up for good. As you know I've been in the local lockup before and while it wasn't a pleasant experience it really wasn't any worse than Junior High with a slightly higher instance of random sodomy.*

*It turns out that all they could really charge me with for that Halloween night was trespassing and vandalism, everything else was circumstantial evidence and ugly rumors. Thing is I get charged with trespassing and vandalism a lot so there was no way I was going to get off with a warning this time.*

*I live in an apartment two floors above the pawnshop that employs me and since my landlady Claretha Vincenzo also owns the pawnshop in question this whole house arrest thing has been a real win win for her. My attendance has never been better and the rent is always on time. There are only two real drawbacks to the whole situation.*

*The first drawback is the electronic monitoring bracelet itself. Sure, they told me I can shower wearing the thing but I'm still paranoid. Which would be worse? Dying from being electrocuted by a faulty ankle monitor or having the police bust down my door while I'm toweling myself off?*

*The second drawback is that I started going through all the emails that had been building up over the last few months. That's how I met Leroy (REDACTED) and the rest of the Colonie Village Nine. You see he sent me dozens of emails each one begging me to watch the enclosed video file.* 

*Finally I did, and this is what I saw...*




[THE NIGHT BLOGGER: ‘Slim To None’ part one
‘Hello Operator, Give Me Number 9’
by
Al Bruno III](http://albruno3.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-night-blogger-slim-to-none-part-one.html)



...the video was grainy and wobbly, the product of a cheap smartphone and low light. It was fall and leaves hung heavy in the trees. Eight teenagers, nine counting the person filming it all, stood around a campfire drinking beers they obviously weren’t old enough to buy.

I could tell they were in the Chalkies. The Chalkies is way back behind the local junior high, it isn‘t quite a forest and isn’t quite a landfill. Neighborhood teens were always partying and getting into mischief back there. Watching them brought back bittersweet memories of my days as a high school football hero. The days when I thought that life was fair and kind.

There was a radio blaring somewhere nearby so the audio wasn’t always easy to make out but I could sure hear it when one of the guys shouted. “Here we are! Class of 2013!” He was, to put it kindly, beefy. Now I don’t mean he was obese, he was just big like a bouncer or a defensive lineman. He was Leroy, the guy that sent me the emails and the videos.

Also, class of 2013? Damn I feel old.

“A toast!” one of the girls held up a beer can, she was blonde and slim, her name, I would later learn, was Gigi.

They all slammed their beers together, laughing and splashing foam on each other.

Then a gothy looking kid spoke up, “To the guys of 2013!”

The guys of 2013, all six of them, cheered. Now I know what you’re thinking- a Hispanic Goth? Hanging out with a jock?

Maybe there’s hope for this generation yet huh?

The image went wild, swinging around to reveal three girls, the blonde Gigi, a black girl named Tameka and the camerawoman herself, a thin brunette named Suzie. She shouted, “To the girls of 2013!”

More cheers.

A plain looking guy named Kurt raised his beer can, “And to the angel!”

The cheers were less than enthusiastic for that.

The radio still blared and the camera phone's viewpoint still shifted. Suzie made sure to give all eight of her friends a little air time and I got to meet the other three guys, Dave, Clayton and Bob. Funny how if you get enough people together there’s always someone named Bob.

The party continued but the atmosphere had definitely changed. I guess toasts to angels are a real mood killer for some folks. Personally I don't know much about angels but I do know a crazy redhead that insists she's the Devil.

Everyone mingled and talked but thanks to the subtle and witty lyrics of LMFAO there was no hearing a complete conversation.

“...might get a scholarship but my Dad doesn't want...”

“...still dream about the fire sometimes...”

“...and she stood me up! Again!”

“...no I haven't and I wouldn't...”

“...I wish he would get off that angel bullshit, it was just some guy...”

“...a new car? Sure but with what money?”

“...known each other for twelve years, ask me anything...”

A flare of static interrupted the song, it was loud enough to make all the kids flinch. Clayton said, “What the Hell is wrong with that CD?”

Everyone gathered around the expensive piece of electronics. Clayton fiddled with it but the static didn't go away, and then there was a shriek of feedback. Some of the kids shouted, some covered their ears. Turning off the CD player didn't help. In fact, I think it made it a little worse.

One of the guys screamed, it was Leroy I think.

“Over there!”

The camera went wild, spinning back and forth and up and down. It didn’t focus on anything for long but I could make out each of the nine figures around the campfire. 

Suzie screamed.

The video ended...

*

*...did you get it? Did you see what happened? I didn't at first. Here are the facts;*

*Fact: Since that night Suzie (REDACTED) has been missing. Searches of the Chalkies and the surrounding area have revealed nothing. Police feel the other eight teenagers are withholding information and the investigation is stymied.*

*Fact: Suzie (REDACTED), Leroy (REDACTED), Kurt (REDACTED), Clayton (REDACTED), Gigi (REDACTED), Bob (REDACTED), Dave (REDACTED), Tameka(REDACTED) and Julio (REDACTED) are known colloquially as the Colonie Village Nine. In 2001 they were all first graders in a classroom taught by a Mrs, Mcyntire.* 

*Fact: In February of that year there was a major fire at Colonie Village Elementary School. A fire for which the cause is still unknown.* 

*Fact: Nine students had become trapped in the building. No one could find them and they were feared dead.* 

*Fact: They children were found some time later almost a mile from scene.*

*Fact: When interviewed all the children gave the same story, that a silent stranger had rescued them. Not a one of the kids could give a description of the good Samaritan's face but eight of the children were positive the man was wearing a suit.*

*All of them except for Kurt. He insisted, and still does for that matter, that they'd been saved by an angel.*

*Fact: As I said before, when the chaos began and the camera phone panned across the area nine figures were visible by the firelight.*

*Nine.*

*But remember Suzie was filming. So who is our party crasher? I ran the video over and over again. If you looked carefully you could see him every once in a while; a lanky shape, at first watching from the treeline but slowly, almost timidly, drawing closer. He was only really clearly visible for a few frames near the end but what I saw made my blood turn to ice.*

*The uninvited guest was freakishly tall and wore a dark suit.* 

*And his face? He had no face, no face at all.*

I apologize for the way it has been wrote, but to keep it authentic I’m copying it straight from the journal, word for word

Day 1, Friday, July 31st 

July 31st 2012 - 6:28 PM - It's been a long day, I've spent most of my day with, Joe and Jacob. The day was filled with mundane and uninteresting tasks, from playing ""Call of Duty"" to watching videos on ""YouTube"", nothing special. I think we're going to go out to an old abandoned graveyard later that should make this day much more interesting. Joe seems rather nervous, he's been very paranoid lately, it’s strange, and I asked him what was wrong he didn't respond very well, I don't think he wants to talk about it.
__________________________________________________________
‘Game over!’ The TV projected with a roaring volume, another round of Call of duty was over and Jacob was the victor yet again, Joe seemed rather out of place today, not very with it to say the least. I figured I should do what best friends are supposed to do and find out what’s up.

""*You alright Joe?*""

 I inquired patting him on the back, he seemed rather upset today, quite unusual for him.

""*Yeah, I'm fine*"" 

He replied pushing my hand away and throwing his controller aside

""*Just have had some trouble sleeping, that's all*""

I shrugged and accepted his answer, probably the best I would get.

""*So*""

 I said in an attempt to further the conversation
 
""*What’s this?*""

I inquired as I picked up an odd drawing off the floor, it was very simple, just an x through a circle. Suddenly, Joe began to shake his head violently and twitch nervously and in a single movement he ripped the paper from my hand, tearing it apart in the process.

""**It's nothing!**""

He replied, he was almost screaming.

Jacob and I gave him an odd look and went back to discussing our plans for later; it was probably for the best we didn't inquire any further. I figured it might’ve just been nerves or relationship problems, something I shouldn’t mettle in.

_________________________________________________________

July 31st 2012 - 12:39 PM – The graveyard held up to its description, abandoned and creepy as hell, at the end of the night we were being followed by god knows what. I don’t have much time to write, I’ve been having a hard time sleeping and I’ve also developed an odd cough on occasion, I’m going to go get some rest and try to get this night out of my head and attempt to avoid getting sick.
__________________________________________________________
The graveyard was daunting, not that large but, just something about going into a graveyard at night makes me uneasy, and as I’m sure it does to every remotely sane person.

The gates were open and the area was barely lit, it was what had been advertised.

""*Abandoned, eh?*""

I remarked pushing on the gate a slight bit, it creaked back and forth before returning to its resting place against the stones. It looked like it was broken long ago.

""*It's abandoned... abandoned indeed*""

Jacob said in reply to my statement, looking back to check on Joe whom was lagging behind, back near the car.

""*You coming?*""

He asked with a slight bit of condescending sarcasm, it was obvious this was the last place Joe wanted to be. And I felt sorry for bringing him here, with his paranoia and being in a dark place full of death and disdain I can’t blame him. But he picked up the pace and caught up with Jake and I, halfway down the broken path.

Soon, the path came to an end, shattered and roughly hewn graves were strewn throughout the distance, many had been vandalized.

“*Damned teenagers, can’t help but destroy graves.*”

I commented out loud as I studied the various markings and messages in spray paint, one of them stood out to me, and I think Joe as well. The same markings I had found on the paper In Joes house were spray painted on a few graves.

“*I don’t like this, let’s go*”


Joe commented from behind us as he began to walk away in a hurried pace, something seemed really odd about how he was acting. But I dared not to question him yet, I decided I would wait until later to ask him about all of this; still it bothered me quite a bit.

Turning to Jake I simply shrugged and began to follow Joe down the broken path; we kept silent throughout the time it took us to reach the car. The atmosphere had begun to really sink in, frequent chills ran down my spine and I felt as if I was being watched, repeatedly I jumped at shadows and small noises.  The walk took about 15 minutes, enough for me to want to leave that place as badly as Joe seemingly wanted to.

We all loaded into the car still in silence, it seemed that was going to be the theme of this evening, Joe repeatedly shook and jumped at about anything he saw or heard and Jake sat stalwart, transfixing his gaze out the window. I wonder what he was looking at; He’s secretive so I don’t think I’ll ever know.

I turned the key and looked in my rear view mirror, a man in a full suit with a tie stood about 10 feet away illuminated by my cars tail lights. He was abnormally tall and his face seemed obscured… even non-existent perhaps, anyway who the hell goes out in a graveyard at night in a full suit?

“*Guys… do you see that too?*”

I inquired hoping neither of them had noticed it and it was just my imagination, Jacob turned and looked back, Joe had already curled himself into a ball in the back seat.

“*What the…*”

Jacob responded as he looked back upon the figure

“*He… has no face*”

With those words I shifted into drive and slammed my foot on the gas pedal, taking off and leaving whatever the hell that was behind us. We said nothing the remainder of the drive; I was still in quite a bit of shock. I’m guessing Jacob was as well, Joe on the other hand was mumbling to himself in a maddened state, I’m starting to worry about him.

I dropped them off and exchanged goodbyes, no one wanted to talk about what we had seen, especially Joe. Also I seem to have picked up a nasty cough, quite odd because I was fine earlier… but I’ve had enough of tonight, I’m not going to ask questions that might get me answers I don’t want.

Day 2, Wednesday, August 1st

August 1st 2012 – 6:23 AM - This morning I was scared awake by a call, Joe was missing and no one had any clue where he was.  I was asked to come when I was available and join in the search for him. I was up and going within 20 minutes, though I didn’t sleep well I kept having dreams of the man in the suit, standing off in the distance watching me, faceless and horrid.  I don’t know how well I’ll function today, but I’m going to go try to help find Joe and maybe then do some research to find out what the hell that thing was.
____________________________________________________

My dreams, or rather I say nightmares were filled with that man I had seen last night, repeatedly I awoke with cold sweat dripping down my face, though around 6:20 this morning I received a panicked call from Jake.  His brother had gone missing and no one knew where he had disappeared to.

“*Johnny!*”

Jacob said quite loud, almost yelling in fact

“*Joe’s gone missing! We can’t find him anywhere; there is no trace of him even leaving the house last night.*”


I sighed in response, my voice was slightly shaken


“*Alright, I’ll be right over*”


Quickly as I could manage this early in the morning, I got myself dressed and ready to leave, as I left I gazed into the mirror, damn I looked tired.

“*Lookin’ good*”

I remarked sarcastically to myself, with a little chuckle I grabbed my keys and went out to my car making sure to lock the house tightly as I always do. Something seemed off, or maybe it was the fact I was up before dawn had fully struck, whichever one of those it was I decided I should check my back seat to see if Joe had left anything that might help me find him.


Nothing of real interest seemed to be back there, my car was a mess though so finding anything in that back seat would take a miracle. I gave up my search and headed over to Joe’s house, Jacob was standing outside waiting for me; it looked like he hadn’t slept much either last night. And Joe’s car was still parked in his spot in the driveway, how odd… where would he have gone without his car?

“*Hey Jake, you okay there man?* “

I inquired as I shook his hand, I wondered if he was having odd dreams like I was, but I decided not to ask. Joe’s safety was the primary concern, everything else could be taken care of later, especially my questions.


He replied with a brisk nod, shrugging his shoulders


“*I’ve been better, I can tell you that for sure*”


We both chuckled and headed inside to grab flashlights, the house seemed normal, nothing was out of place that I could tell. And it seemed Jacob had already scoured most of it looking for some kind of evidence of Joe leaving in the night, to no avail.


“*Where the hell could he have gone this early in the morning?*”


I asked looking over to Jacob as he slid batteries into both of the flashlights, handing me one he replied


“*Hell if I know, I honestly don’t think I want to know.*”


I nodded in response; I was a bit reluctant to find out as well, though I wanted to know Joe was alive and well more than I cared for my fears or doubts


“*Did you check his computer?*”


I asked as Jacob grabbed himself some breakfast and sat down; he merely shook his head in response and pointed over to it as if motioning for me to check it out.

I nodded and sat down at Joe’s desk chair, running my hand down to feel for the power button on the tower… when the monitor flashed on making me jump backwards as a loud screeching sound emitted from the speakers. Quickly I turned down the volume and watched the screen continue to flash on and off, until finally stopping and revealing his desktop. Something was written on the notepad which had been left open, nothing large in size, just three words.


‘He’s always watching’


Those words sunk in all too quickly and I felt as if I was in danger, obviously Joe had left that message for us.  With all the commotion I hadn’t even noticed Jacob had run in behind me and had witnessed what I had, I turned and noticed him, raising my hand I pointed at the screen.


“*That’s a bit foreboding don’t you think?*”


My sarcastic inquiry was met with a nod and a sarcastic reply


“*Yeah, the message? Or his computer having a seizure?*”


Jacob said with a small smirk planted on his face, though I could tell it was a guise holding the fear that ran through him back


“*Both*”


I replied pushing the chair back in, a slight bit of paranoia had overcome me due to the previous events and I continually looked around and over my shoulder. 


“*Where the hell should we even start to look for him?*”


Jacob asked, as he began to look over his shoulder as well, the paranoia seemed to be rubbing off on him. That was an excellent question though, I had no idea where Joe could have or even would have gone, especially without his car.

I compare it to Mike Myers in the original Halloween, he was just some masked dude who hung in the shadows and killed people, freaky as fuck. In my opinion simple things like that are the scariest.

I've got a few questions.

I've noticed that people who draw Slendy apparently are being ""used"" by Slendy. Honestly,I don't understand. I've had the urge to draw him,But I just haven't yet.

I've been wanting to meet Slendy,but not meet him,If you know what I mean. I'm not scared of him. I've even played the game and not been scared. But...At the same time of wanting to meet him...I don't.

And can anyone give me info really on Slenderman? I'm still rather confused on everything. I want as many facts as I can get on him. I want to know more...

And I know a lot of people have said the ones that think Slendy is a killer and does nothing but kill,what if it's for a purpose? What if he's doing it to keep from something wrong from happening? I know he kills kids,but what if he knows that they might have one day killed someone? And he was preventing that?

At about 2 in the morning, my friend halts construction on the thing he is building. I then hear his mic cut off, so I asked him what's going on. He didn't answer, so I ignored him and continued building until 4 am. I then checked the party to see if he was still in it, and he was. In the party, it said he was playing community game, but when I check my friends list it said he was watching YouTube videos and had been offline for 3 hours. I then noticed I had a message from him in my inbox. Sent about the time his mic cut out, it said;

""WTF IS THIS SHIT!? HELP ME!""

I replied to the message; ""Did Slenderman get ya?;)"".

I'm not one for irrational fears of fake monsters, but after sending that message, I did start to kind of get a little freaked out. I was convinced he was trolling me, but that didn't stop the wide-eyes I had for another hour or so before falling asleep.

I just find it ironic that we were on a conversation about Slenderman, while building a structure that greatly referenced him, and my friend just kind of ""died"" on me. I received a message from him hours later saying that he merely fell asleep, but the experience was still creepy as hell.

I posted a link our first entry a few months back. Now that we have finished season 1 I'd like to share it with all of you. This is a project my friends and I worked on for the past couple months. We looked back on Slenderman in his early days, when he was known as Slenderbro. These entries are about his roommates, Tyler and Ben and all the mishaps that they endure. Hope you enjoy!

Please hear me out, as I am so confused as to what happened/is happening... So over a week ago, I was driving to work at 5:20 A.M. The fog was awful. My headlights made it more difficult to see than help. I was coming around a turn, passing [Blank] road. In front of this road is a house, and an old building next to it. It's blue, no window or door, just holes where they used to be. It's roof has caved in and it's useless. When this happened, the only thing in front of it was an old wooden post (there is now a sign on it, off to the side), and a bunch of dirt. I come around the corner in the fog, and the light from the street light obscured my vision where I couldn't see, until I got next to the building. Out of habit, I look over at it, and notice a man in a suit, very tall, standing just outside the light, next to the door. I couldn't see much of his face or much detail, but I got creeped out and sped up really fast. That day I got home and did my normal routine. (Shower, eat, Xbox). But before I went to sleep, my remote went missing. I just left the tv on for the night. The next night, my Xbox mic and a controller went missing. Two nights later, my football gloves went missing. Most of this stuff keeps leaving without a trace. I don't know if it has anything to do with that man, but it's very weird. I'll post a picture soon of the building and house, and get you guys opinion. I'll keep you all posted on anything else to go missing as well. I'm just a little bit creeped out and worried",,False,self,t5_2st64,False,,,True,t3_y0tpg,http://www.reddit.com/r/SlenderMan/comments/y0tpg/something_in_the_fog_post_from_rnosleep/,
