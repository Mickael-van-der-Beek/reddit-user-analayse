I am The_Chieftain (real name Nicholas Moran. I can say that, it’s on my videos). Known for being the tall guy with the cavalry hat and strange accent who knows a lot about tanks. Well, the accent, granted, is a bit unusual, after having lived so many years in Ireland. However, I now have two American roles. Firstly Wargaming found me at a local tank museum, and decided to bring me on to bring a bit of first-hand knowledge  into the office. I was playing WoT long before I met Wargaming in person, mind. Secondly, I hold a commission in the US Army, currently I’m a member of the Nevada Army National Guard, which tends to keep me busy some weekends. This second career has had the benefit of sending me to places I wouldn’t ordinarily have gone, such as Iraq, Afghanistan and South Dakota. This is the result of a mis-spent youth, where, instead of learning something useful, I instead put my effort into reading Red Storm Rising and making scale models. I certainly haven’t in any way used my law degree, which in hindsight, was an optimistic college choice.
Within the office, I officially belong to the Marketing department with the title of Director of Militaria Relations, but you will know most of my public work from community involvement. Being an enthusiastic WoT player, I like to think I’m a part of the player community as much as an interaction with them, but that may just be my optimism.
Outside the office, I shoot things, fly light aircraft, model, and tease cats with laser pointers because I believe them to be evil. This has resulted in some conflict with Gaea. 
So, this being an “Ask me Anything”, I guess you should get asking.

I’ve got an amazing team with tremendous experience and passion towards continuing the growth of the company’s flagship free-to-play game, World of Tanks, and building momentum for its three upcoming titles planned for release within the next year. The team oversees customer support, community management, marketing, PR and Business Development for the North America and Oceania regions.

Prior to Wargaming, I held director-level positions at Frogster America, Music Mogul, and Sulake. With more than 18 years of industry experience, I also founded an interactive agency to provide insights into microtransaction business models, virtual currency exchanges and secondary markets in MMOs.  Accenture, Disney Interactive, Activision, Wells Fargo, and American Pacific Lines are a handful of the established brands I’ve worked with. 

Sorry team. I have to run for now. It's been a pleasure chatting with you all. I'll definitely be back and look at doing this on a much more regular basis. In the interim the Chieftain, General Direction and Nyx are also here for you.

As mentioned in a post below, if you include your in-games names in your questions (posted up til now 2:35) we'll send you something in WoT. 

Forgot to add a link to the picture I mention about the guys checkin the depth of the armor the IS7 for accuracy with what was in the game:

http://img821.imageshack.us/img821/2416/4395ec3590235aec753d14d.jpg

Also want to follow up and say thanks again for the chance to sit and chat with you all. I believe the WoT community is the most enjoyable to be a part of, especially when you look at other PvP centric environment. I'll be checking in and answering as many questions as I can over the weekend. Happy Hunting!

My second Reddit thing. For those of you who missed the last time I did this, I am The_Chieftain (real name Nicholas Moran. I can say that, it’s on my videos). Known for being the tall guy with the cavalry hat and strange accent who knows a lot about tanks. Well, the accent, granted, is a bit unusual, after having lived so many years in Ireland. However, I now have two American roles. Firstly Wargaming found me at a local tank museum, and decided to bring me on to bring a bit of first-hand knowledge into the office. I was playing WoT long before I met Wargaming in person, mind. Secondly, I hold a commission in the US Army, currently I’m a member of the Nevada Army National Guard, which tends to keep me busy some weekends. This second career has had the benefit of sending me to places I wouldn’t ordinarily have gone, such as Iraq, Afghanistan and South Dakota. This is the result of a mis-spent youth, where, instead of learning something useful, I instead put my effort into reading Red Storm Rising and making scale models. I certainly haven’t in any way used my law degree, which in hindsight, was an optimistic college choice. Within the office, I officially belong to the Marketing department with the title of Director of Militaria Relations, but you will know most of my public work from community involvement. Being an enthusiastic WoT player, I like to think I’m a part of the player community as much as an interaction with them, but that may just be my optimism. Outside the office, I shoot things, fly light aircraft (When I have the time and money), model, and tease cats with laser pointers because I believe them to be evil. This has resulted in some conflict with Gaea. So, this being an “Ask me Anything”, I guess you should get asking.

1352859463.0,130,self.WorldofTanks,135por,Tank Fun Facts,Roflkopt3r,143,13,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/135por/tank_fun_facts/,"Hey r/WoT, I've heard and read many funny things about specific tanks now including many from the community, so I would love if we could gather some! Especially because there are so many different stories from different countries that apparently few foreigners know. I'll start:

* The M4 Sherman was called the ""Tommykocher"" (""Tommy Cooker"") amongst German soldiers because it was prone to catching fire in its early versions.

* The M3 Lee was known as ""A grave for six friends"" amongst the Russians, again because it would burn easily.

* The Ferdinand was powered by two petrol engines that powered two generators which powered two electromotors. Because it was underpowered, the early versions sometimes caught fire just from driving, at least four Ferdinand almost burned out due to this. Other than that it was actually much better than its reputation.

* The gratings above the front-mounted engine of the Ferdi were also a weak point, for example to artillery and molotov coctails. This caused one of the most bizzarre losses of a Ferdinand: While driving along a railway embankment, a PzKpfw III on the other side of the embankment got hit and its burning turret flew over the embankment onto the Ferdinand's grating, setting the engine ablaze! (source: ""Heavy Tank Destroyers"" by Walter J. Spielberger, Thomas Jentz and Hilary L. Doyle).

* The ABC protection of the German Leopard 2 tank can also be used as an air conditioner, and its filter has the exact size of a 12-pallett of canned beer...

* Some German crewmen claim to have accelerated a Leopard 2 (with its ~60 tons of weight) to 116 km/h (72 mph) on a German highway, which however makes the tank unsteerable and causes quite a pain in the ears.

* Many German tanks throughout history had the ability to dive up to 4.5m (almost 15 ft), including the early versions of PzKpfw VI Tiger and the currently used Leopard 2.

* One of the most bizzarre incidents involving Tiger tanks happened near Anzio, where the 3rd company of heavy tank batallion 508 lost 15 out of their 16 Tigers within 48 hours: Three of their tanks broke down due to mechanical issues during the battle. All 13 others moved down a railroad embankment, and ALL of them got their guns stuck in the ground at the bottom, requiring the crews to evacuate the tanks to dig out the barrels! (source: ""Tiger Tank"" by Roger Ford)

* American Shermans in the pacific area used HE rounds against Japanese tanks, because their AP rounds would just fly through them as if they were paper.

* Shermans usually kept an HE round loaded as their first shot, because they were primarily fighting against infantry and would be unable to penetrate heavier German tanks like Panter, Jagdpanther or Tiger anyway. They would also use HE rounds against these tanks, hoping to damage at least optics or tracks. One Sherman shot *30* HE rounds against a single Tiger and managed to knock the crew out, as it expired from concussion!

1366780484.0,122,self.WorldofTanks,1czqet,So you want to know how to passive scout?,JBWill,134,12,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/1czqet/so_you_want_to_know_how_to_passive_scout/,"A lot of people I've talked to have had problems figuring out how to be a useful passive scout, and I got bored and slightly intoxicated tonight so  I decided to try and make a little guide for it.  I'm no unicum player, I don't claim to be amazing at this game, but I do do a lot of passive scouting, and I have figured out a lot of spots that I like and seem to work pretty well.

At its heart, passive scouting is a pretty easy concept: you find and sit in a spot where you can light up the enemy team in an area without being spotted.  The two very most critical attributes to look for in a passive scout are view range and camo value (mobility is also important most of the time as you need to get to a passive scouting spot before the enemy team gets there).  As such, binoculars are almost a must; these give you the largest possible view range you can have, which will let you spot enemy tanks further away and sooner.  Training camo skills on your crew is also very important, as it will make you less likely to be spotted both getting into and sitting in your spot.  Most light tanks are fine with just crew camo training, but some lights and most mediums will be made much more effective by also mounting a camo net.  Also one thing I can't stress enough:  **SIXTH SENSE IS SUPER IMPORTANT**.  Get it first for a passive scout (or really pretty much anything) always.  It's extremely valuable to know when you're spotted so A) you can run away as soon as possible (you may be spotted even if no one is shooting/aiming at you, and chances are good if you don't know and don't move, you're going to catch an arty shell pretty quick) and B) so you can start to know what you can get away with, and how close people have to get to actually spot you.  Just remember two important things: one is that Sixth Sense has a 3 second delay, so you're not going to know instantly when you're spotted.  Just because you have Sixth Sense and it hasn't popped doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention to when people suddenly swivel and aim straight at you.  The other is that the automatic spotting distance is 50m, so no matter how good your camo is, you're going to be instantly spotted once your opponent is within 50m (~~which is why it's very useful to have a reticle mod that includes distance to target, such as [j1mbo's crosshair mod](http://www.curse.com/wot-mods/worldoftanks/j1mb0s-reticles)~~ I've been informed that the stock crosshair does distance to target, I had forgotten that,  I still highly recommend j1mbo's just because it's awesome, and the reload timer is something that I know the stock reticle doesn't have).

Good passive scouting tanks include, but are not limited to (in no particular order):

* T-50
* T-50-2
* Luchs
* Pz38nA
* Chaffee
* ELC AMX
* AMX 12t
* AMX 13-75
* AMX 13-90
* T71
* 59-16
* WZ-131
* WZ-132
* Type 62

Those are all tanks that I would consider not really needing camo nets (unless you haven't trained camo on their crews yet).  Tier 10 games will also often include Batchats, T-62As, and M48 Pattons as passive scouts, which are all more likely to need a camo net if they want to remain unspotted longer.

*Note that I'm not saying the tanks in that list should only be used for passive scouting, or even primarily for passive scouting, just that they are capable of doing it.  Some are also obviously much better than others.*

So, the biggest challenge is knowing where to go.  I decided to make some images of the passive scouting spots I usually use.  They're mostly approximate, with a few of them I had issues trying to translate what I see in game to an exact spot on the map, but most of them should be pretty close.  This is also obviously not a complete list of every good passive scouting spot (or even every map), there are a lot more that I sometimes use, and I'm sure there are all sorts of good ones that I don't know about.  [**Here's the album.**](http://imgur.com/a/FMYf8)  The light icons are the locations you can sit (green icon indicates from side 1, red is from side 2), and the yellow lines indicate the range you'll usually be looking/spotting.

A quick rundown of the different maps:

**Arctic Region**  
Not the greatest passive scouting map, but if you're quick and spawn on side 2 you can hop into the bush in G6 and often spot a lot of their tanks heading to the south road, allowing artillery to get in shots before they get into the cover of the mountain.

**Cliff**  
These spots are pretty short term.  If you rush to the spots on that ridge at the very beginning, you'll be able to spot the enemy team coming up the hill, which again gives your artillery a chance to get shots in before they find cover, or even know they're vulnerable.

**Erlenberg**  
From those spots you can keep pretty much anything defending the north/south bridges lit, allowing them to be hit by artillery or tanks sitting further back on the hills behind you.

**Fjords**  
Fairly self explanatory.  Only try the spot in B7 if you've got really good camo, and be ready to bail if they start to push.

**Highway**  
Again fairly self explanatory

**Lakeville**  
A very fun map to passive scout on.  From those two spots you can light anything the other team has heading to the town allowing arty and your teammates to get shots in.  You're far enough away that you can actually often take pot shots at them yourself without getting spotted (depending on your tank and their positions).  From the south side, you also have shots down a few roads so you can hit people in the town.

**Live Oaks**  
This is one that I had problems pinpointing where the spots were on the map.  The green icon is actually in a spot where there's two trees right next to each other, you can quickly knock down the two trees and sit inside them (obviously if you have a very attentive opponent they may notice the trees down and know you're there, but that's hardly ever going to happen in pubs).  The red icon is in a bush that's just to the north west of that little house on stilts that's down close to the water.  Those spots will let you light tanks moving towards and entering the town.

**Malinovka**  
Probably the easiest map to passive scout on.  The spots are all fairly self explanatory.  For the spot in F5, make sure to travel down below the edge of the decline there so you stay out of sight until you pop up into the bush.  That spot lets you see pretty much everything going up the hill, often almost all the way up to B5 or so.

**Mountain Pass**  
That spot from side 1 will spot things crossing H6.

**Murovanka**  
I actually should have put the green icon more down where the red icon is.  You can pretty much just find any bush in the magical forest and sit in it, if you're in a light tank chances are they won't spot you until within 50m.  Just remember that there's a bit of a ridge on the left side of the forest, so if you stay in the 8/9 line you're going to have the best chance to see things.

**Redshire**  
Pretty straightforward.

**Steppes**  
From that bush looking either direction you'll spot pretty much anything heading east.  It also provides you with handy arty cover that you can duck into as soon as you're spotted.

**Westfield**  
These spots are all pretty unaggressive passive scouting spots, I mostly just use them when we don't have a ton down in the south so I can spot any medium/light tanks making an arty run.  From the J9 spot you can also spot things sitting on the E0 ridge.

One last important note before I succumb to the alcohol that I have imbibed this night and go to sleep.  If you're planning on passive scouting a particular area, particularly one of the more aggressive ones that allows you to spot people moving into position (Lakeville, Cliff, Live Oaks, etc), **COMMUNICATE YOUR INTENTION WITH YOUR TEAM**.  Let your arty know that you're going to be giving them easy targets in a specific place before the match even begins.  That way they can pre aim in that area and be ready to unleash hell upon the people you spot.  It doesn't do much good to spot all those people if no one is ready for it, because chances are high that by the time they have a chance to turn and aim, it's already going to be too late.

Also, don't be that guy who spots people and then rages about how they're not instantly dead.  That just makes you an asshole.  Sometimes people miss, or are concentrating other places.  Grow up and deal with it.  Passive scouting can be very frustrating in pubs, but it can also be highly effective if you do it right.

Ok, I'm going to sleep, you can commence making fun of me now.  Feel free to ask any questions you may have and either I'll answer them when I'm free tomorrow (or in like an hour when I probably give up on trying to sleep), or if you're lucky someone else who's probably way better at this than I am can answer them.

I somehow have acquired a fanbase on this site somehow and one of my fans asked me in game when going to make my next guide, so here I am on how to pad your stats.

Boring ass life story:
Hi I'm a bad that pads, I'm actually pretty bad at this game (readmyname), every other game I pretty much full yolo and die, because I play this game like call of duty, because it's boring not shooting things. I was just solopubbing and generally being bad for my first  couple thousands of battles (it was tier 6 were I found out you actually had to wait for the reticle to aim in lol, before that I just fired full bloom). Was 55% at the time, because somehow despite knowing about aim time, I still could carry games in my baddie form. At this point I joined one of the best clans on the server at the time, and learned a lot from their members and the world of tanks forums. For the longest time I thought I was going to be stuck at 55% forever, but eventually I suddenly ticked 56% and I realized that by improving, my w/r would go up, thus for the next 4000 battles pure solopub I raised it to 59%. Then I quit the game for 7 months to go play LoL, and came back late 2012. Then I joined the kittehs and met other unicums who truly knew the intricacies of the game mechanics and how to utilize them, as well as playing with good players and seeing their playstyles and incorporating their strengths into my own play, did the serious w/r climb began. I found a few players with similarily aggressive playstyles like mine, we found some yolo routes on some maps that worked amazing (like my d6 el halluf strat of fame) and from there on out I started power padding. From 7.5k-10k battles I went from 59%-65%, winning about 82% of the battles along the way.

65% w/r overall
80% w/r last 60 days
http://www.noobmeter.com/player/na/worstplayer_na
http://wotlabs.net/na/player/worstplayer_na

So here we go.

Part 1:

What stats are important:

1. W/R, nothing counts more than winning, you can do all the damage you want, you can can pad your wn7 all you want , but if you can't win, then you're still bad. I've played with superunicums that all they do is farm the lower tiers and pad amazing dpgs, but they can't win because they don't put damage on the right targets at the right time, like they straight up farm a tiger instead of a e75 because dat dpg bro. Sure you can pad it by getting carried in platoons, or playing in tank companies all day, but then it'll be easy to spot that it's padded by looking at dpg/other factors.

2. DPG, damage, or damage upon detection for scouts and mediums. Doing damage without receiving damage is how you win matches basically, rule of thumb you want your average damage per game in a tank to be at least equal to your tanks hp.

3. Wn7/efficency w/e, irrelevant really as they are really easy to pad if you know how to do it. 
Like I can play arty 24/7, and get 3k wn7 no problem as it'll see that I'm averaging 2.5k damage per game in a tier 6 tank, and wn7 metric can't figure out it's arty. Basically DEFENCE POINTS FAST KILLSHOTS FAST LEGGO AVERAGE DAMAGE PER TIER FAST
However it's still useful as a general metric on a players skill.

Guidelines on w/r and skill:

Assuming  they aren't padded as fuck from tank companies or seal clubbing;

45% and under: I can't tell if you're a bot or a real player, that's how bad you are.
46-48%: Bad@tanks and where the average pubbie lies, you rarely contribute positively towards winning the game, if you ignore your confirmation bias you prob have this win rate as you just don't have enough impact on the game/do enough damage.
49-52%: Pretty good in comparison to the average pubbie, you have better decision making than most, but sitll haven't quite got to the level where you can consistently impact the game.
53-55%: where most of the ""okaish to good"" player lie, you usually impact the game positevely, but probably don't understand the intricacies of game mechanics to carry the bads.
56-60%: Nearing the unicum status, you have decent decision making and mechanical skill.
60%-64%: Unicums, most of them know the game mechanics very well compared to the average pubbie, and they can use their knowledge of the game to make decisions that consistently help carry the team.
65%+ : we're all dirty stat padders and really aren't that good mkay

You might think, hey the server average is 48%, so I'm average right? well if you go to wotnews, players with 10k+ battles the average is actually 53%, because new players typically lose more as they learn to play the game. So infact the average player at 10k battles is actually 53% and thus 48%ers are bads that drag down their team.

Do you feel offended being called a bad? Well have no fear, it's actually extremely easy to climb the w/r ladder if you truly put effort in it.
____________________________________________________________________________

PART 2: HOW 2 WIN

First of all: come up with a gameplan to win. A common mistake I see players have is that they entire a pub match and just follow the horde, doing whatever. STOP

First look at their tank lineup: where do you think their tanks are going to go? If they have a shit ton of tds in murovanka north side, you know they are going to stack forest, so just play the north and stay out of their firing lines. Xvm is also useful here, know which players are the largest threats(focus them first), but never overextend to kill a unicum, it's much better to kill his pubbie meatshields and swarm him later on, rather than yolodieing for the chance of damaging him. 

Look at their lineup, guess where their tanks are going and plan a route to be most effective accordingly, avoid playing where their line up would have an advantage (aka close range if they have lots of mid tier soviet heavies, or hilly areas if they have a t29 stack).

Don't camp hard, I know people tell you to be patient, but that's actually terrible advice. Rule of thumb, 30 seconds if you don't have a firing lane on someone, and you can safely relocate, do it, because if you aren't in a position to spot or do damage, you are useless. Instead of camping to get favorable engagements, rather go aggressive and utilize map tricks to force the enemies into favorable engagements. I was going to write more map guides, like my el halluf one, but I'm lazy and I'll do it one day. But when you commit hard to a spot, always have an escape route ready when shits about to go down. But don't full yolo (unless you're me and have the pure swag to pull it off), if you need to camp because you're forced into a bad position, just do camp it out.

Be aware of arty at all times, always assume if you're lite, arties about to fuck you over, so learn where arty can't hit you in common arty spots and hug that cover for dear life, especially in high tier games. Playing arty will give you a much better idea on how this is done. I'm really trying to hammer this into my mindset, I'm spotted, I'm about to get fucked by arty so I better back down.

Have your tanks set up right, aka best crew skills(6th sense is god on everything), read up on my t10 crew skill guide for a general guideline, it's also in the reddit wot wiki. Have the best module set up and try to minimize how stock your tanks are, if you have spare gold, feel free to make yourself less of a burden to your team and at least get the best gun. 

Play good tanks if you really want to pad hard, aka is6/t29/heat54/hellcat.etc, tanks that over perform for their team or tanks that fit your playstyle. However I believe every tank in the game is good(other than the e4, it blows), and you can do well in them, just some do better than others.

Always be prepared for the cap-fast, don't hesitate on returning to base, even if you have 5 tanks left and they only have 2 heading to base, never underestimate how retarded your pubbies can be, head back to base if you see they commit to cap fasting. Too many games I have lost because I asummed people were competent enough to defend.

Be flexible, another extremely common mistake I see players I'm coaching make is head to a flank and stay there the entire game. Unless you're in a maus, you can always move. Hugging cover for a minute straight because you can't engage on their camping tds? well move the fuck away from there, head to the other side of the map(if you can do it safely) and turn the tide there. Really always think of where you can move if you don't think you are doing anything there. If you see replays on how I play, you'll see me roam the map hard, especially in mediums as I want to impact the game as much as I can.

**Get your mechanics down
** 
I can't stress this enough, like I got to 59% solopubbing pretty much only because I'm azn and was born with the ability to click good. If you keep playing, and take note of weakspots 
(http://wotguru.com/weak-spot-guides/ is a good place to study them) and start to commit them into muscle memory you will see your damage dramatically go up, thus winning more. Like I'm at the point where if I see a e75, my hand from muscle  memory automatically just aims at it's lower glacis or turret hatch. It's automatic and in enough time, you'll get it down to that level too. Study the weakspots, practice on them ingame and eventually you'll get them down perfectly.

Don't hesitate to spam gold ammo: it's much easier with a premium account, but in CRUCIAL SITUATIONS, where the games outcome is decided, never be put into a position where you don't have enough gold rounds to swing the match. Run 80% ap and 20% gold in most tanks, because if you're in a vk3601h and theirs a tiger p that needs to be dead now, don't be caught in the position where you can't pen him and thus the game is lost. Gold ammo is a tool to be used, nto and exploit

2. When the enemy makes mistakes, you benefit.

AMA!",GeneralDirection_WGA,130,30,304,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/14gt8d/i_am_kevin_van_ness_aka_generaldirection_head_of/,"Howdy, Redditors! Kevin Van Ness (a.k.a. GeneralDirection) here; this is my first IaAMA, but I’m very familiar with how Reddit works.

While Wargaming is my first foray into the publishing side of the game industry, I’m no stranger to it. I’ve worked in the industry for almost six years now, which I owe largely to EverQuest. I joined a raiding guild there that lasted into World of Warcraft, where I picked up my first industry gig with Curse, Inc. thanks to some expansion leveling guides that I wrote. I worked there as Community Manager, Content Manager and Lead Editor over the course of a little more than five years before joining the team at Wargaming America.

My position at Wargaming America is Head of Community, which means I oversee all Community operations for North America. We’re part of the Customer Relations department that also includes Customer Support and eSports.

I manage an incredibly cool and ridiculously talented team of professionals that cover:

* Community (Gaea, Mugsy_) – Analyze and deliver player feedback to the dev team; deliver their philosophy to you; engage in discussions with you on the forum; develop concepts for cool new gameplay elements
* Game Events (Major_Rampage) – Design in-game events and contests (specials, Operations, MVPs, All Stars, etc.); create Gift Shop packages; plan real life player events (i.e. player gatherings)
* Content (hobbstrosity, Minister_of_Propaganda) – Write and publish all of the NA-specific content you read on a daily basis, including game events news; create unique informative content like our recently released Quick Start Guide; copy edit patch notes and release information
* Social Media (Nyx) – Manage Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts; curate content from players on YouTube and other social media; promote player-created content on the World of Tanks website, including fan art; coordinate with the fantastic team of moderators here on Reddit to create opportunities like today; LOTS more to come in 2013

I have my pulse on the development of all Wargaming products, but I’d like to respectfully ask that you focus questions on World of Tanks for now. I can field some questions on Warplanes and Warships, but we’re not quite ready to spill the beans on them yet.

I’m happy to also answer questions related to our event design philosophy, our social media strategy or how we plan out all of the content that we publish, so ask away!

Huge changes are afoot in Rddt7. With some much needed restructuring the changes can be found:   http://www.reddit.com/r/RDDT7/comments/1b8wz3/upcoming_changes_and_some_that_have_happened_now/  
Please note that following what is to be expected as a huge purge all sub-commander positions will be available and needed.

You might be tempted to downvote this thread as a means to tell Neb to fuck off. Don't. In fact, upvote it. Upvote the hell out of it. I want this sucker at the top of the front page so everyone can see what is going on.    
  
I am only going to tell you this once Neb. Leave. Get the fuck out. Yesterday pretty much all the officers and quite a few members of RDDT7 got in TS and talked about the state of the clan, in response to post and demands of attendance. While there were disagreements into the direction the clan should head (social vs serious tanking), it was pretty unanimous that we would prefer to go in whichever direction without you. You are unfit to command a clan. I have already left RDDT7 to join RDDT4 after I got my T9 yesterday (before all this crap) so this isn't be being bitter, angry or petty. This is me caring about the health of this clan. Numerous people have threatened to leave. Some probably already have (and I would have left because of this as well but it seems you can't leave twice). And there is no guarantee that they will remain in the RDDT family of clans. So now you are making every RDDT clan look bad.
Yesterday, I was in favor of trying to talk to you and reason it out. But sacking ERPP8 is the last straw. You need to leave and transfer the commander position to someone capable of leading, preferable Woots.  
  
Otherwise I have the following to say. If anyone who is reading this is in RDDT7, I urge you to leave and join another RDDT clan. We're not all cunts like Neb. If you are thinking of joining RDDT7 for the glory of an officer position, don't. If you're in another RDDT clan, keep tanking with pride and ignore this dickhead and his petty kingdom of a clan.",,False,self,t5_2s113,1364582849.0,,,True,t3_1b97ch,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/1b97ch/reddit_7_disband_mirror/,

We recently passed 10,000 subscribers on the subreddit! This makes the /r/worldoftanks community the largest English speaking WoT fan site on the web. This has truely been a wild ride, we started off as such a small commuinity and never dreamed we would become so large. As a way to give back, the moderators and myself have decided to host the **/r/Worldoftanks 10k Celebration Week!** I have been working with my local Wargaming office and planning this event for over a month now, and I am happy to give you the following details:

List of Events:


1. **Monday 7/22: [Wargaming Interview with RDDT as a part of their first Clan Spotlight!](http://worldoftanks.com/en/news/cw/clan-spotlight-reddit/)** Go inside the minds of RDDT's clan commanders and learn all you need to know!
2. **Tuesday 7/23: Casual Platooning with Wargaming America.** Like the WGA staff and like platooning? Well this event is for you. Starting tomorrow at 4 PM PDT (7 PM EDT), RDDT members will be able to platoon with some of the WGA staff. Want to know to be chosen? Well, join the special channel on our Teamspeak server called the ""WGA Platoon Lounge"" where we will randomly select players to join platoons with WGA staff. 
3. **Wednesday 7/24: RDDT (Main) + WGA Absolute Tank Company.** 3 PM PDT (6 PM EDT) Do you think you have what it takes to beat the powers of Reddit and Wargaming? Well, if you do, there is gold to be won! [If not, be sure to watch us on Wargaming's Twitch!](http://www.twitch.tv/worldoftanks) Just like any other weekly Wargaming tank company you get 500 Gold for a win, 250 Gold for a loss, but nothing for a draw. Come at us social clans!
4. **Thursday 7/25 Part 2: An AMA with the WGA Staff who helped make this event possible.** Get to know the people who work at Wargaming America. Feel free to ask them anything just know you will not always receive a response. How terrible. 
5. **Thursday 7/25 Part 1: Community Night Special Edition.**  6 PM PDT (9 PM EDT) We heard people are tired of ELC races.... well we have heard you loud and clear! This community night will feature all new events with prizes supplied by Wargaming America! This event is open to the public, anyone from any clan can join us on our teamspeak!


Contests:

We will also be holding various contests and giveaways throughout the week. I am happy to announce the first contest.

1. **Creative Contest: [Snoo](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/06/whats-snoo.html) + WoT:** Our little friend snoo has been wearing the same look for nearly two years. We want to see if anyone can create someone different. We are going to be looking for the best use of Snoo + WoTs. This can be anything from a Photoshopped logo, to a picture of a cake, to a tattoo on your face. We really do not care. This contest winners will be community chosen. [RULES AND DETAILS HERE.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/1ivtu6/rules_creative_contest_snoo_wot/)

1373255323.0,91,self.WorldofTanks,1hucan,the arty nerf is changing the metagame.,niuzeta,115,24,283,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/1hucan/the_arty_nerf_is_changing_the_metagame/,"i've played a fair amount of games since the 8.6 update. I've given the new artys a try and well, to be honest, they do not play well. This isn't another *arty-nerf-omg*-esq whine but looking at the impact of patch in some different angle. Bear with me for next two paragraphs where I entail 8.6 arty nerf, or skip to the fourth paragraph for actual point.

Yes, they hit well, considering you've contracted the aiming circle to fullest. Yes, they still do reasonable amount of damage when hit. But other than that, the shell fly distance took a hit, aiming circle dispersion is ever so greater and *don't even get me started with the reloading time*.

When you play a game where you roll around a vehicle with heavy guns, you generally have fun while shooting them, and hitting them. 8.6 certainly has been a pleasant experience with heavies and mediums. But with the arty nerf you can't shoot as many, and the (cost for making mistake is ever so high.* I'm speaking as a 50%-winrate public searcher and not a good player. Having survived the old M7 Priest, I think I can reasonably hit a moving target. Now I think again before even attempting to. Still, with the accuracy revamp they still hit reasonably well.

The point is that **arty is not as much fun as it used to be, and that people are playing it less.**  Ask yourself how many 3-arty game you've played a few days after the patch deployment. Someone from /r/worldoftanks has submitted the considerable decrease of arties in search last week. During this weekend I haven't played a game where there were more than 2 artys in the game. Most were no-arty or one-arty games.

Now let's look at lights. Pre-8.6, they had four major functions(you may disagree here): passive scout, active scout, flanking, and arty hunting. In 3 or 4 arty games it was worthwhile for the lights(1375, 1390, etc) to sneak into the enemy base because the artys would realign their cannons and shoot at the enemies they've lighted, or even take a shot at artys.

Now, you can't count on the artys on our side to hit on time, because the circle dispersion is ever so high that you need to survive longer, *and* since the accuracy buff you're more likely to get hit. Also, with less artys on the enemy side there's suddenly less motivation to risk going into the enemy base. Thus, less artys in game severely limits lights' roles in each game.

If you like heavies-vs-heavies-while-mediums-flank type of brawl, maybe the change is good for you. I personally play lights and mediums that flank, infiltrate, and wreck havoc in enemy lines. During the weekend I've seen my playstyle in each game changing into more of a flanker and a passive scout. Suddenly playing lights weren't as fun. I picked up meds and heavies and they were great; especially when there were less arty fires to worry about.(there are less artys in the field, and even if one hit, I could count the next thirty seconds to be free, for example)

the metagame of world of tanks was successful, in my opinion, because the roles of different classes were very distinctively set and executed differently. And whether like it or not, each class was dependent on the others' presence in game. If there are less artys in game, then lights will soon follow the trend. *That* is what I worry.

**TL;DR: since 8.6, artys are visibly less played. This, in turn, limits the roles of lights(active scouting, infiltration, and arty hunting), and the games are more played like simple brawls than pre-8.6 metagame.**

1357250135.0,92,self.WorldofTanks,15wtn1,Taking Advantage of Artillery: A Guide,LincLoL,109,17,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/15wtn1/taking_advantage_of_artillery_a_guide/,"Hey all! I've been seeing a lot of teams misusing/mistreating their artillery lately, so I thought I'd post my thoughts on how to take better advantage of a vital asset to any team, the artillery.
**For a tl;dr, just read the bold text!**

First, I think it's best that everyone understands just how important artillery is. **Artillery on your team is important when:**

* **They are firing at targets in your vicinity.** This is pretty much a no-brainer. If artillery is firing at the same target as you, or any tanks near you, you have the upper hand.

* **They are firing at targets that are not in your vicinity.** Okay, so they're not helping you kill your targets. But that's okay! As long as the enemy team knows there's artillery actively supporting your team, they're going to be hesitant to push forward and put themselves in your artillery's line of fire. When artillery starts getting kills, the tanks on the other team will see that. It doesn't really matter which side of the map the artillery is firing on, because **just by firing they're bringing down the other team's morale** and giving you opportunities to attack when your target hesitates.

* **They are not firing at all.** This is not so much of a no-brainer. Let's say your artillery hasn't fired a single shot. Maybe they're afk. Odds are, **the other team will still be just as hesitant to move up** because they know there's artillery. They just don't know the artillery isn't firing.

Second, **protect your artillery!** I cannot stress this enough! If you're on the west side of the map with the majority of your team, and you're all dying because your artillery isn't supporting you, odds are your team left the east flank wide open and artillery has to concentrate their fire on that flank to defend their own asses! **If you see a big gap in a flank** (i.e. your team went to one side of the map) then **go to that flank!** Hang back, hide behind cover, and spot for the artillery! Take some shots if it's safe, but your main job now is to **support the artillery!**

Third, **don't blame everything on artillery.** They get blamed way too much for things that are (most of the time) not their fault. If you stop and think about it, there are a LOT of different reasons as to why your artillery didn't support you and you died. A few reasons are:

* Your team (and **you) left a flank wide open.** See example above.

* You did not **communicate effectively with your artillery** (see below).

* **Artillery couldn't get a shot on your target(s).** This is a very common occurrence, and artillery gets blamed a lot for this, mostly by people who haven't played artillery before. Depending on which models your artillery are, they very well might not have been able to get a clean shot on your target. If your target is sitting right up against a building or hill or any other obstruction, it's most likely very hard to get a shot on your target. This brings me to my next point...

Fourth, if you haven't already, **play artillery!** You can't blame your artillery for anything if you yourself haven't tried artillery. I see all too often people complaining about artillery and how ""easy mode"" it is. By playing artillery, you’ll see that it’s not as easy as you might have originally thought. Also, you’ll learn new tactics to avoid being killed by artillery if you actually know how they work. **There's a lot that comes with playing artillery** that a lot of people are ignorant about, including:

* **Shell travel time:** unless you're really good at artillery, **it's very hard to hit a moving target.** Your shot has to be calculated perfectly. And because of the arc that the shell travels in, the **travel time is often a lot higher than most other tanks.**

* **Reload time:** most artillery are very powerful. This is balanced by the large amount of time they take to reload after every shot.

* **Movement:** artillery usually isn't very agile or fast. **It takes a while for artillery to change position or maneuver** between shots. Also, in the artillery view, if you move your sights horizontally too far, your hull has to move to adjust and this resets the aiming time. 

* **Aiming time:** this is usually also quite long. And as I said above, **when the hull moves, the aiming time is reset.**

* **Armor:** some are artillery are strong and can take a few hits, while some are weak and get one-shotted. It varies, but **artillery armor usually isn't up to par. This,** coupled with their lack of mobility **makes them very prone to small, fast tanks** that easily slip through the front-line defenses.

My fifth, and final point is probably the most important. **Communicate with your artillery! Work with your artillery!** They're there to be used, so use them! **Take advantage of them.** They can mean the world and turn the tides very fast. **Some ways to work with your artillery include:**

* **Requesting fire.** The default key for this is your ""T"" key. **Simply aim at a target and press ""T"".** This will ping the map, make a sound, and notify your team that you need help attacking your target. If you use this key, odds are **you'll catch your artillery's attention and receive supporting fire in seconds.** Just hang tight, keep the enemy spotted, and **let your artillery support you.**

* **Pinging the map.** This is just as important as requesting fire. Hold down your ""ctrl"" key and left-click anywhere on your minimap to draw attention to a certain location. **Artillery can see tracers, trees falling, anything that's destructible, etc.** and if you **tell them where to look,** they'll be able to blindly **shoot at the enemy** and have a pretty good chance of hitting them.
* **Using chat.** If you feel that the time is right, and you want to advance on your enemy’s position, **let your artillery know by using chat.** If you’re polite, and tell them you’re most likely going to spot a few targets for them, **they’ll have your back.**

* Okay, so let's say you use one of these three ways to get your artillery's attention. What can you do now? You can **keep the enemy spotted.** Not only does this help artillery, but it also gives you bonus XP if they hit targets you've spotted. You can also **lure your target out of cover** if the artillery can't hit them. This can be tricky, but use your imagination. Also, when you do get them out of cover, **don't go for weak spots** to try and damage them. If you hit them, they'll just roll back into cover and sit there, still alive. Instead, **track them! Aim for their treads, immobilize them, and let artillery do its job.** Nothing is better as artillery than having an immobile target to shoot at; it's like **shooting fish in a barrel!**

Well, that does it. If at least one person learns something new from this, I feel I've done a good thing. And if more people have their eyes opened, and understand artillery a little bit more, I've accomplished what I set out to do!

Let me give it to you straight boys, relationships with women are fraught with minefields, even when you have the best of intentions.  A comment you might mean in one way can often be perceived as meaning something else, usually negative, involving one of your girlfriend's or wife's insecurities.  Think it can't happen in WoT?  You`re wrong.

I usually decorate my tanks with the Canadian flag and peace symbol.  When I reached my first tier X tank, I thought I might put an inscription on it as well.  It was an American tank, and none of the available inscriptions were really suitable.  My second tier X was a JgPzE100.  While decorating it, I noticed the inscription ""Greta"" was available (my wife's nickname).  What a great way to honour my wife and show her how important she is to me and that I think about her even when I'm gaming those hours a day downstairs.  I decorated the tank and then showed my wife.  Here are two possible endings to this story.  Guess which one actually happened.

A.  My wife shed tears of joys as she embraced me warmly and reminded me what a stud I was and how my excessive gaming turned her on.

B.  My wife took one look at that fat ugly German tank destroyer and broke down in tears because it was ""an obvious"" allusion to what she sees as her excessive weight and that was why I would associate her name with that fat f*****g tank.  I am now persona non gratas around here as I get the old cold shoulder.  F*****g Nazis!

How to setup the ""useful"" aka most played tier 10 tanks.

Part 1:
GET 6TH SENSE FIRST ON EVERY TANK DON'T BE A FUCKING RETARD AND PASS OVER OP PERK THAT IS SO USEFUL ESPECIALLY IN MID/END GAME WHERE IT BECOMES MAP HACKS
Ok?

**Tier 10 Mediums**

**Batchat+T62a**

Commander:
Sixth Sense/Camo/Repair/Recon

Gunner:
Camo/Snapshot/Repair/Designated Target

Driver:
Camo/Clutch breaking(smooth ride on 62)/Repair/off road driving

Loader(on t62)
Camo/repair/safe stowage

Modules:
Gunlaying/Optics/Vertstab

**Explanation**:
Camo first, 17.5 coefficent on both tanks makes it one of the best stealthy scouts in the game, also camo is your primary defence, as this has no armor.  Clutch breaking due to very shitty terrain passability when turning, at max speed the agility improvement is very noticeable. Don't get offroad driving on the t62, as it's terrain coefficents are already very, very good.
Snap shot is because of the terrible dispersion on the turret, it helps deliver your spike faster. Modules lets you reach max view range(445 is game engine limit irrc) as well as lower dispersion to help you deliver your spike faster. On t62 replace the coated optics with rammer, as this lets you have maximal dpm platform. Insanely small aim time, insanely high dpm. However in certain maps roles/ binocs/camo net might has use. *Camo skill also reduces the time you are lite for (read the xml files)*

**Tier 10 Tds**

**Foch155+E3+268** (and no fuck you e4 lovers, the 57 has replaced it as the t110 supporter and the e100 is superior to it in all regards anyways)

Commander:
Sixth Sense/ Repair(camo first on 268)/ Camo/BIA

Gunner:
Repair/Camo/Snapshot(it works on tds, game treats the gun movement as a prototurret)/BIA

Driver:
Repair/Camo/Clutchbreaking/BIA

Loader:

Repair/Camo/Safestowage/BIA

Modules:
Gunlaying/Rammer/Vents (replace rammer with toolkit/optics on foch)

**Explanation**:
Repair first on nonturreted tds, other than the 268 because of it's retarded camo co efficent(which you want to maximize right away. Repair minimizes your downtime, and the base td camo bonus is sufficent for grinding first crew skill. 2nd Round get camo to maximize your very good coefficents, then 3rd set get things that improve your soft stats. BIA for 4th, really it's overrated and rushing it is not as effective.

Modules are to maximize up time and damage output.

**
T10 Heavies**

**E100/110E5/T57**

Commander:
Sixth Sense/Repair/BIA or camo for 3/4th based on preference (obviously not camo on e100)

Gunner:
Repair/Snapshot/ bia or camo

Driver:
Repair/Clutchbreaking/ bia or camo

Loader:

Repair/ Safestowage / Bia or camo

Modules:

Gunlaying(or vents)/vertstab/Rammer

Explanation:

Skills are there to maximize soft stats and up time once again. Camo's actually very underated, the coefficents on the 110 and 57 aren't that bad. 7.5 is usable

Modules is debatable, like some super unicums swear to me that getting all the aim time modules is the best fucking thing ever as a split second spent aiming is a split second spent in enemy fire exposure, but vents also work fine.

**
Tier 8 Arty:**
(note get camo 2nd on bat 155)

Commander:

6th Sense/ BIA/ Camo

Gunner:

Snap shot(it works on arty, considered proto turret)/ BIA/ Camo

Driver:

Clutch Breaking/ BIA / Camo

Loader:

Repair/Bia/camo

Modules:

Gunlaying/rammer/camo net(replace rammer with like repair kit or something on the 155)

**Explanation**:

Camo actually sucks on tier 8 arty, they have 1.5 co efficents which is nothing, essentially add like 50% camo to something with 0 camo is still 0 camo. However nothing better for 3rd skill, so get it anyways. Like if you test out camo skill on tier 8 arty, it makes almost no difference.

kinda lonely with only 1-5 people being on at a time when we obviously have enough to fill +/- 15 clans.

also the in game channel is always randomly reset to prevent channel blocking/hoarding so make sure to resubscribe/rejoin when it dose reset.

I'm going to describe an effective and low risk flanking maneuver.  It's a really simple thing to do but so many tankers mess it up and get killed too early when the try to flank enemy heavies.  This tactic is best used on city maps when the heavy tanks on each side are slugging it out. It's very useful when you are under tiered.  Here's how it works:

* Wait until your heavies and the enemy heavies are engaged in battle
* Ideally there will be a cluster of enemy heavies
* Using cover, drive around to the side or rear of the enemy tanks
* Shoot one of them and see what happens
* If they don't turn towards you then keep plugging away.  You can do tremendous damage if they ignore you.
* If you see their turrets turning towards you then try to make one more shot before reversing back behind a building or other cover.
* Now here is the lazy part.  Now that you are behind cover all you need to do is sit there.  Do not rush out and take another shot if their turrets are facing towards you.  You will die.
* Look around the corner by right clicking and rotating the camera.  Watch what the enemy heavies are doing.
* If 1 or more enemy tanks keep their turrets pointed at you then you are doing your job.  You have effectively taken their enemy tanks out of the battle without taking any damage yourself.
* If they turn their turrets back towards your heavies (away from you) then leave cover and shoot them again.  Rinse and repeat.

This tactic is especially powerful because it confuses and frustrates your enemies.  Everybody hates being flanked.  But they especially hate being flanked by tanks they cannot shoot back at.

Like I said, this is a really simple tactic.  It should be obvious to seasoned medium/light tankers.  But for some reason I rarely see people pull this off.

Good luck.  And remember, you don't have to deal damage to be an effective member of your team.",,False,self,t5_2s113,False,,usplayer,True,t3_18u3kv,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/18u3kv/the_lazy_flanking_maneuver/,

I wanted to give you a peek into the community we now have on /r/WorldofTanks.

When I first join this sub-reddit we had just a few hundred subscribers and RDTT2 had just been accidentally created. My win rate was a solid 47% with my highest tank of a M6 Heavy. The RDDT clans had about 120 members. Oh how times have changed...

**Clans:**

Now, we currently have 11 North American clans, RDDT-RDDTX + NARWL, 5 EU clans, and one red headed step child. Both EU and NA have been seeing a surge of growth recently. All in all, **we have over 1,000 players** in RDDT based clans across these two servers. We are also looking at starting a RDDT SEA based clan as interest has been shown. We are one of the largest communities of players in tanks, if not the largest. 

**Teamspeak**

You guys keep breaking teamspeak, apparently a 200 player server is not good enough for you anymore. Also, it turns out teamspeak mutes everyone when there are more then 100 people in a channel (we fixed that). We recently updated the server to a 300 man teamspeak since you guys kept reaching the max. [The server is ran exclusively off donations made by you](https://www.nfoservers.com/donate.pl?force_recipient=1&amp;recipient=rddtwot@gmail.com), so for that we have to say thanks. You guys make this possible.

**Wargaming** 

We have had 5 AMAs from Wargaming staff, and what you might not know is that every time they posted one we would break daily sub-reddit traffic records.

* [Jeremy Monroe, General Manager for Wargaming America.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/10yby8/i_am_jeremy_monroe_general_manager_for_wargaming/)

We also have employees /u/Ectar_WG and /u/CatStalker-WG post quite frequently on the sub-reddit, stealing much karma from normal users.

**The Subreddit**

Behind the scenes, we have exploded. The sub-reddit has seen unprecedented growth over the last year. We have nearly tripled our traffic (and our moderators) since last June. We have also seen two redesigns in the sub-reddit style, both of which have been very well received. Next to the official forums, we are the largest community for talking about all things world of tanks. 

Currently, we average about 30 new subscribers to the sub-reddit every day. We are on track to hit 10,000 subscribers (or as we call them tankers) by at least the middle of July. We are looking to try and do something special for that, stay tuned!

Holy.... look at those pageviews!? 1.4 million.... you sure like hitting refresh.

Daily traffic over the last week averaged 6,006 unique visitors and 45,895 pageviews a day.

This is what my 13 year old brother made for me this year.

http://i.imgur.com/8v2Iq.jpg

He carefully asked me two months in advance what my favorite tank was. It's the VK3601H. I completely forgot about me mentioning it until he told me about his plan to ask everyone about their favorite things just in case he made something for them.

In the poem he wrote that he wanted to buy me a VK3601H, but that it was too expensive (not to mention the fact one was never fully completed). So he made me a miniature out of EPS and cardboard.

It came out as the bastard child between a VK3601H and a Loltraktor, but I still think it was awesome of him to make this for me.

So thank you, my younger brother!",,False,self,t5_2s113,False,,euplayer,True,t3_14dxxj,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/14dxxj/my_younger_brother_crafted_me_a_tank_miniature/,

Tomorrow night (*Thursday, July 25*) will be our largest Community Night to date.  Come join in on the celebration starting at **9pm EST/7pm MST/6pm PST** for a few hours of competition, teamwork, and prizes.  ***Anyone from any clan can join!*** After hours of deliberation and testing, we are adding four new events into the Community Night fray [based upon *your* suggestions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/1hrm1y/attention_looking_to_revamp_community_night/)  These new events, and their rules, include:

*NEW* **BATTLE BRIDGE** 

* Two teams of 15 tanks compete for control of the bridge by pushing and ramming each other off to certain death.  Shooting and backing off the bridge are forbidden
* Starting with Tier I, but could be any tier
* Maps include Mountain Pass, Port, Sacred Valley, and Serene Coast

*NEW* **HIDE-AND-SEEK**

* One team of 15 hiders have two minutes to hide while one seeker remains AFK.  Then the seeker attempts to find all 15 hiders.  Last few tanks to be found win.
* One judge/host will also be in game, but remains at cap
* Open to all tiers and all tanks, but obviously you want something that can hide.  No shooting whatsoever
* There will be no practice rounds
* Maps include: Abbey, Dragon's Ridge, Erlenberg, Sacred Valley, Westfield, Highway
* Prizes include: *3x* 3 days of Premium w/ 300 gold

*NEW* **THE LONG JUMP**

* Take a tank of your choice to try and jump further than all others.  This event is open to 28 participants with one judge/host and one corpse-clearer
* There will be a practice jump, but once the real jump starts you will only have one chance (as most tanks die in one jump)
* Maps include: El Halluf, Westfield
* Prizes include: *3x* 3 days of Premium w/ 300 gold

*NEW* **PZ. 1C RACING**

* Race at speeds upwards of 79 km/h against 29 other opponents.  Similar to ELC Racing except that the Pz. 1C actually turns better.  
* As with all races, there will be practice laps beforehand
* Maps include: [well you'll just have to find out!](http://i.imgur.com/AmVEYiO.gif)
* Prizes include: *1x* [Pz. Kpfw. B2 740](http://wiki.worldoftanks.com/Pz.Kpfw._B2_740_%28f%29) w/ garage slot, *1x* [T-15](http://wiki.worldoftanks.com/T-15) w/ garage slot, *1x* [T2 Light Tank](http://wiki.worldoftanks.com/T2_Light_Tank) w/ garage slot, and *1x* 3 days of Premium w/ 300 gold

**ELC RACING**

* We all know what this is, and it's back.  Race against other ELC AMX drivers using ramming and shells to achieve first place.  
* Practice laps for each map
* Maps include: [Dragon's Ridge, Erlenberg, Himmelsdorf, Pearl River, Port, Sacred Valley, and Swamp](http://imgur.com/a/Yg6iN)
* Prizes include: *1x* [Pz. Kpfw. B2 740](http://wiki.worldoftanks.com/Pz.Kpfw._B2_740_%28f%29) w/ garage slot, *1x* [T-15](http://wiki.worldoftanks.com/T-15) w/ garage slot, and *1x* [T2 Light Tank](http://wiki.worldoftanks.com/T2_Light_Tank) w/ garage slot

**BATTLE BOATS**

* Arguably RDDT's national sport.  Two teams of 15 SPGs fight like handicapped tanks by never stopping and never backing up
* Take *any* SPG you feel like and fire on the move
* Map: Malinovka 

Be sure to have sufficient credits in your bank and enough coffee to keep you going.  More details will be released as we go.  Your three hosts for tomorrow night will be [myself](http://worldoftanks.com/community/accounts/1000955324-Gottfried_von_Brunn3n/), [Klaus_von_Angry](http://worldoftanks.com/community/accounts/1000955296-Klaus_von_Angry/), and [zdude1858](http://worldoftanks.com/community/accounts/1002724771-zdude1858/).  The following link outlines how prizes for [Hide-and-Seek, The Long Jump, Pz. 1C Racing, and ELC Racing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x7HgrVZhV13P70WlRSnK6Knrf3S8hMSsHZGbDRsgDsA/edit#slide=id.p) will be determined.

We have gotten some complaints that a few sister clan's members (RDTT2/RDDT3-X) are teamkilling and harassing Enjoy/Enjoy2 in random battles. This is not cool, while our ending with Enjoy was... less than perfect, we in RDDT main do not harbor any ill will against the clan members. Their leadership made a bad call, please do not take this out on people who had nothing to do with it. They are just trying to play the game. 


When you teamkill Enjoy [- _ -] or EnjoyToo [- _ -2] members, you just end up hurting RDDT mains reputation among clans.  Also, do not try and berate or insult them in pub matches, push them around, or mess with them in any way. Take the high ground. We do not want people thinking ""well, if a deal goes south with RDDT all their clans will TK us"" and refuse to work with us. People generally like the RDDT clans, I want to keep it that way. 
    

**Just Stop.**

1358531436.0,62,self.WorldofTanks,16tsey,5 Keys to Effective Passive Scouting,Azrou,70,8,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/16tsey/5_keys_to_effective_passive_scouting/,"***5 Keys to Effective Passive Scouting***

1. **Knowledge**: understand how the spotting system, view range, and camouflage work.  A Maus 450 meters away is impossible to detect, because the maximum spotting range is 445 meters.  Many light and medium tanks can remain undetected at 300-350 meters even while in an open field because of their natural camouflage.  Light tanks maintain the same natural camouflage regardless of whether they are moving or still.
2. **Tank selection**: lights and mediums make the best passive scouts, but heavies and TDs can and should do it situationally (just not for an entire match duration).  Fast, low-profile tanks with 390+ meter view range are ideal.  Examples: T71, AMX 1390, BatChat, Chaffee, and T-54.  At higher tiers, passive scouting is extremely valuable because your teammates are more likely to actually damage the targets you are spotting.  At lower tiers, sometimes you simply have to do the damage yourself.
3. **Equipment/skills**: Unlike other stats such as reload and aim time that are expected to exceed their listed values, your commander caps out at 100% skill and you will simply not spot anything beyond your turret's nominal view range.  Because of this, equipment and crew skills are critical.  Coated optics are preferred and the most flexible, but binoculars are also powerful.  Your most effective work is done on the margins of spotting range from 400-445 meters, and equipment is required to reach this.  Other skills and equipment that can help are ventilation, brothers in arms, recon, situational awareness, and camouflage boosters.  Sixth sense should be the first completed skill on your commander and will increase your survival rate substantially.
4. **Map familiarity**: seek out a bush or tree in a central area that controls as much of the map as possible and that you can reach quickly without putting yourself in danger.  Examples: E8 on Malinovka, E4 on Mountain Pass.  Identify possible locations on each map even when you are playing your other tanks so you will be able to take advantage of them when the opportunity arises.
5. **Decision-making**: do not fire unless it is necessary for your survival or you are absolutely sure you will not be detected.  Firing removes 75-85% of all camouflage sources including your natural rating, crew skill, net, bushes, and paint.  In addition, any bushes or trees within 15 meters  drop an additional 70% of their bonus.  You must weigh whether firing and losing cover is more beneficial than maintaining sight on enemies that would not otherwise be visible to your teammates.  You may do several hundred damage but be forced to abandon your position, vs. friendly tanks and artillery potentially doing thousands of damage.  But, sometimes it can be worth it if you are finishing off a wounded tank or intend to relocate anyway.

Here is an example replay: http://mwreplays.com/replay/UWC2HFY8BC8B/

It is not a perfect set-up because the crew is only is only at about 50% on their first skill and they are learning repairs.  However, it demonstrates how much of a difference the right tank can make if used properly.  I could have easily done more damage - but spotting was more valuable for the team.",,False,self,t5_2s113,False,,usplayer,True,t3_16tsey,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/16tsey/5_keys_to_effective_passive_scouting/,

1359393373.0,62,self.WorldofTanks,17fqvd,An open letter to the pub clans complaining about Clan Wars fairness,DamienJaxx,88,26,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/17fqvd/an_open_letter_to_the_pub_clans_complaining_about/,"Hi there!

So you’re upset about this whole WG North American Clan Wars fiasco, right? You think you’ll never be able to break into Clan Wars on a competitive level because it’s full of big clans with big guns, right? Hogwash! Stop focusing on them and start focusing on yourself.
 
Ask yourself, how did the big clans get there? Why is it that they always win? Answer: they take clan wars seriously and have been playing the game long enough to know what works and what doesn’t. In addition, success begets success. When you win land and farm gold, you use that gold to fight for more land. Your success attracts new members. Your success gets you invited to alliances.

“But how the hell do I break into clan wars with my measly 30-40 members with 2-3 tier 10’s among them?” you may be asking. Do what we (RDDT) did. Get serious about it.

Let’s talk about some history of RDDT. At the time I joined RDDT and began working with others to get RDDT into clan wars, the subreddit had less than 300 subscribers, RDDT was full of inactive people and there was no real goal. Essentially, we were a pub clan existing only to provide a home to fellow Redditors. How many tier 10’s do you think we had at the time? I can tell you, not enough to field a clan wars team.

That changed because myself and a few others GOT SERIOUS. How do you get serious? Start small and work your way up. Here are some tips:

* Set up a Mumble server (now TeamSpeak). This is essential; if you can’t afford TS, get Mumble. It works nearly as well.
* Get on scribblar or Advanced Tactical Center (Scribblar is better because people don’t need to download anything). Develop strategies on the maps you want to play. Make sure people are on the same page. Don’t you dare pull a fucking pub strat in CW. Clan wars is a different beast. People actually work together, so don’t bring that pub shit into it or you’ll be laughed at while your tanks sit as smoking ruins.
* Do some tank companies. Run Champion companies if you can, you’ll go up against the big clans and you’ll quickly learn what teamwork does. If you can’t do champion companies, then you have no business being in CW.
* Make sure you get at least one clan wars team. Fill it with tier 10’s of whatever you have at the time. If you don’t have tier 10’s, then drop to tier 9’s. It is possible to win with tier 9’s. One clan wars team can take land and hold it.
* Sign up for tournaments. RDDT entered its first tournament mere weeks after reorganizing. How did we do? Oh, we made it to the elite 8 and got stomped by our pals in SSGS. What did we learn? A.) That we were better than we thought. B.) that others started to see us as an up and coming force. C.) that is was damn fun and we were hooked.
* Start in Africa (soon to be Mexico). Those clans down there? Yeah, they’re new to CW just like you. Some are better than others, but most are learning like you are.
* Accept failure. Adapt. I should probably put this up at top because it’s the most important point. You WILL lose. You will get your face curb stomped by another clan. You will get backstabbed by “allies” and you will cry. What will you do after that? Bitch on the forums and get ridiculed, or learn from it? I guarantee you RDDT got its face curb stomped many times, yet we’re still successful. We adapt. If someone runs an awesome strat against us, you bet we’re going to look at it and use it next time.
* Know when to cut your losses. If you’re firing more gold than you’re earning (usually the case in Africa/Mexico), back out and take a break. Let it cool down and try again. There’s no point in wasting energy and money on a losing battle when someone is determined to map you.
* Know when you suck at running battles. Yeah, I was the commander of RDDT. But how many battles did I lead? Oh probably just a few. I knew I sucked at calling shots, so I gave it to people who were competent and who showed skill. Put your pride on a shelf and leave it there. Clan wars has no room for heroes.
* Diplomacy is key. Most clans get over-extended quickly. That means they have holes in their defenses and are open to attacks from all over. They want to make a deal so that they can protect their back side. Contact other commanders/diplomats in the region you’re attacking. Get invited into their alliances (yes, even the small African clans have alliances). Make connections and use those connections to further your cause.
* Accept the fact that the big clans won’t talk to you. Until you land in Europe and make a name for yourself, they won’t care who the hell you are.
* Don’t get cocky. That next clan you’ve never heard of is going to roll over you and you won’t know what hit you. Take them seriously no matter how bad you think they are.
* Get serious, but have fun. This is just a game and your members are not as excited about running a clan as you are. They just want to play the game with good people and make friends. So don’t be a dick, treat your members with respect and they will respect you and follow you into battle.

How long did it take RDDT to go from reorganization to clan wars? 1 month. How long did it take for us to enter Africa then Europe? 1 month.

I know that’s a lot to take in. And yeah, you’re probably still upset at WG and the big clans. Get over it, move on, and get your clan up and running.

If you need help, shoot me a PM (on here or in-game as DamienJax) and we can set up some time to talk. I will even help you develop your strats for Mexico and what you can do to get better.

**TL:DR** The big clans win because they’re serious. You need to get serious about CW if you want to have a chance. Accept failure and adapt from it. Have fun and don’t be a dick. PM me if you need more advice.

1369302390.0,66,self.WorldofTanks,1ew866,The story of the random noob who planned on pwning all in his iconic King Tiger and his decent into madness,Phooca,81,15,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/1ew866/the_story_of_the_random_noob_who_planned_on/,"Ok we'll start with the average scrub who hears about WoT , probably from those annoying ads on youtube which unless you've ad block you can't switch off , anyway he always wanted to drive tanks and play tank games because he knows he is born tanker with the skills to rival Rommel and Michael Wittmann or Patton I suppose for the US server, so he creates the account with the nickname that contains Rommel because that is the only nickname that can be used by such a skilled tactical tanker like himself... of course he cant register Rommel because it's taken so he takes next nickname ""Rommel289642"" becoming scrub number. 289642 .

So he loads up WOT after logging in and looks at the tech trees , and then see's the Tiger and King Tiger , naturally they're the only tanks that he recognises apart from the Sherman possibly , but then he remembers from his basic history classes in school that the tigers were better and used pwn the Shermans .
Therefore he starts to go for Tiger H  tank , he thinks that when he gets Tiger tank, he will drive around killing poor M4's and T-34's... so he doesn't even bother playing lower tiers , he just suicide rushes in order to get that Tiger tank and he learns nothing in the process about the game.

When he finally gets that Tiger tank he has a problem. He doesn't face M4's and T-34 but IS's, T29's and even sometime St-1 and E-75s . He could pen them, but he doesn't know anything about weak points, and he can even bounce the lower tiers but he doesn't know anything about angling . He still has his crew from the VK as they're at 83% and he doesn't want the % to drop when he retrains them for free. He thinks that kills are only relevant stat, so he tries to kill those 5% HP targets and he thinks that his shocking 47% win rate is  because he gets teamed up with morons and horrible teams because of his fantastic kill rate getting 1 or two kills per game . Also he starts to lose money big time as he does sweet fuck all damage ,  his conclusion is that repairing his tank is expensive, and he will save more if he hides all the time ,  disregarding the fact that you earn money by doing damage .

After 500 games of which he lost 270 (46% win rate ), he gets Tiger II, and it costs even more to repair, so he camps even more and cowers behind the entire team , when team attacks, he stays behind so he can kill enemy tanks with less than 5% of health remaining . Of course he is never to be blamed for loosing the match, he has lots of kills , he killed two A-20 and 6% IS in his last game , and they still lost reinforcing his opinion that his teams suck and the MM hates him.
                                                                 
After a few hundred more games he gets to the E-75 and decides that with his high repair cost it's better to use the 88 as his shell costs are too high , he plays nearly 1k games in the E75 getting set on fire every third game yet not using the fire extinguisher as they're too expensive , he then comes on to the forums to complain about how he's always set on fire and how terrible the German tanks are , and that there is clear bias against the Germans from the Russian developers .


Despite this he struggles on and eventually gets the E-100 , he thinks
Quote
""finally it is my turn , I shall bully all the noobs in their low tier tanks , I am A GOD , I am Tier 10 ""
then a T34 pens his Lower frontal plate and sets him on fire , while he Auto aims with standard AP shells and bounces the front of the T34's turret , He logs onto the forum a second time ,and creates a second thread where he abuses pay to win tanks , Russian Devs , his noob teams and finally says he will no longer give any money nor play the game until they fix his German tank

**What changes were made to the tank?**

None. No changes. The tank is simply no longer available to purchase. The changes are currently slated for 8.7.

**What are those changes?**

Nobody who's talking knows for sure. Current scuttlebutt is less armor more gun, though. Horsepower may also be in the mix.

**How do I sell mine for gold?**

You don't. Not yet. You wait until the changes in 8.7, at which point you will have a chance to try the new (and possibly improved) Super and decide if you like it or not. Then you can get your gold or keep your tank.

You know it will be slow and no one will take a risk after the BatChats are gone, I have had more ties from this than I would have believed at tier 4 or 5.

Let's examine the facts behind this: high tier tanks are expensive to repair, therefore taking a risk isn't worth it.  Truth is, as an arty player every she'll is damn expensive, so I want every shot to count.  I average 6-8 shots a match, that can turn the tide for my team, but it won't dominate the game; however,  if there are 4 or 5 arty,  you are now looking at 32-40 shots per match, on 10 or 11 ""field"" opponents.  That can be as much as 4 arty rounds per opposing tank, no tank survived that. 

How to fix it?  WG needs to limit the number of arty in a match to 2, if arty sits in the queue for 5 minutes, so be it, then that will promote the playing of more regular tanks.  This would instantly make the game better. 

Playing arty at tier 7/8 isn't nearly as much fun as it was at lower tiers, I grind when I need to, but mainly save it for CW's.  Having an arty on your team can be nice, they can bail you out of bad situations, having 4 sucks for every one.",,False,self,t5_2s113,False,,usplayer,True,t3_1b3cfr,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/1b3cfr/its_not_the_arty_killing_high_level_matches_its/,

I've been a long-time viewer of his and he regularly reaches about 2,800 viewers during his streams. His YouTube channel has almost 30,000 subscribers and is filled with helpful gameplay and map tips for new and experienced tankers alike.

We invited QuickyBaby over here to our humble subreddit in the hopes of starting a regular AMA series with well-known WoT personalities. This is your chance to pick his brain about World of Tanks, his stream, YouTube channel or anything else that's on your mind.

If you'd like to submit a question, please do so now or wait until the Wednesday AMA. We will most likely start a post at 7PM EST, wait a bit for questions to come in and have him respond around 8PM EST (11-12PM UTC).

He streams on Tuesdays and Thursdays starting at 18:00 CET (12PM EST).

You can find his live stream at www.twitch.tv/quickybaby

We love how passionate you are about the game--it's been great to see Reddit grow into a community of tankers outside of the official website. I want to support that, so this is one way we will moving forward.

Post your questions here, and then tomorrow I'll check back and try to answer what I can.

For the questions I can't answer, I'll send them off to SerB. He had a lot of fun with the AMA and would like to be more involved in the NA community, so this is one way to make that happen.

I have not posted here much before, but this has driven me to make a post here.  For some I know you will not care about this 'issue', but I am appealing to those interested.

In Patch 8.4 Wargaming will nerf the gun depression of the E-50 and E-50M from -6 degrees to something believed to be around -2 degrees.  Their reasoning for this? Because of graphic errors in which the gun clips some periscopes and so they need to reduce how much the gun depresses by so it does not clip through them.

I believe this is nonsense and many on the European forums are outraged like me.  This is the last German T10 tank that is competitive at all.  It does not need nerfed in my opinion and I seek as many of you that are willing to voice your opinions to try and change Wargamings mind.

I have put URL (I think) into the European topic so all of you can go to the forum where it has started.  On Page 4 it is confirmed by a Moderator that is on purpose and their reasons.  I do not see why it needs changed if the E-50 which has been around for years and the E-50M months functioned before perfectly fine.  I would rather the gun clip a bit and remain balanced than it nerfed so it looks 'pretty'.

Those of you not on the European servers, please start topics on your respective servers if there are none or contribute to existing ones if you have any interest in this.  Do not let the last decent T10 German tank die, enough of nerfing German tanks into the ground for god knows what reason! The more of us that oppose this, the harder it will be for Wargaming to ignore.

Thank you for your time and apologies for the rant.  I just feel strongly on this and I hope to find others who do too.

I write it mostly for myself, to feel better, but I do have a faint hope in my heart that it is a decent read.

I understand that a losing streak is painful. I do. But now and then I see people complaining and openly believing that WG tinkers around the teams and matchmaking so that one side loses. And this is wrong idea.

 Why? Because nobody is special. If you think that a game that holds a Guinness record for the highest number of concurrent players is rigged so that you, that is at average 0,001% of the usual number of concurrent players, are bound to lose then please reconsider this notion.

 Rigging a game so that MM actually selects the remaining 29 players just to get your win ratio lower seems plain impossible to execute. Because then it has to straighten up the record of the remaining 29 players using another 841 players. And then their record has to be adjusted as well, you know.

 Moreover: if 'noobs' are 'pros' used to rig your game then how come that MM never tries to adjust their win ratio? There are people with +60% and -40% win rates. Why would MM focus on one player and keep him around 50% while letting the majority just play normal, not-rigged games?

 Another issue is the shortage of unskilled players. Everybody learns. MM is bound to run out of newbies to keep dragging you down. Because they are put in your team against pros. There is a lot to learn when playing against skilled folks. And the learning is faster this way.

 One may also say that MM is not trying to destroy his stats completely, but just to keep it at ~50% or so, and rigs games only if some secret win ratio threshold is reached. Well, that's more reasonable.

 I wondered how would I achieve 50% WR among the players. For me, the best way to keep one's stats around 50% is to set them up against equal opponents. So if you attribute a losing streak to MM trying to get you back to the meager 50% WR then remember that you are likely put against your equals.



TL;DR: MM is not rigged for you, you are not special, nobody is.

As you may or may not be aware, RDDT has coming 6th place for the first stage of the clan wars campaign with 85,000 Victory Points. While RDDT did miss top five by only 5k Victory Points, we are a lock for making top 30 overall. We would like to take a moment to thank all of those who helped us reach this goal.

**RDTT2:** For being on the smaller (not yet full people!) RDDT clans, you guys still did very well in this event. Great job on the landing zone. 

**RDDT3:** We know that you guys could not participate on a regular basis, but we know that you did all you could.

**RDDT4:** You guys were able to clear the landing zone on several nights and were invaluable in providing the intel we needed. Honestly, I am not sure we could have done this without you guys on that landing zone. I know we like to call you a training clan, but in fact you are right up there with us at the front fighting alongside us as comrades in arms. 

**RDDT5:** I know you did not work with us for the entire campaign, but shifting gears near the end when you could have just continued to land was noticed.

**RDDT6:** You guys literally came out of nowhere and did fantastic at clan wars. Really, everyone is impressed with you accomplished. RDDT6 &gt; RDTT2  &amp; RDDT4 confirmed.

**RDDT7:** Taking land was a huge victory for this clan, congrats! We hope to get you guys some gold to change the logo in the upcoming stages to repay our gratitude.

**RDDT8,9,X:** Even though you did not participate like the other clans, we still received moral support from many of the members. Thank you for that. 

**NARWL:** We ate your land, every night we took hard earned victory points from you guys. NARWL is the biggest factor for even our #6 spot, and our goal of getting top 30 is safe due to the efforts of your clan. You guys fought hard against clans from the beginning, giving QIN a run for their money in the end. I only hope we can repay this debt later in the campaign. Scratch that, we will repay it.

**RDDT** Just remember guys, we may not be in top five, but are going to get top 30. We cannot let this bring us down, we must keep our eyes on the prize. M60s are still up for grabs. 

---
Finally, I would like to end on a good note. I would like to thank our commander **Ledif** for all of the hard work and dedication he has put in for every RDDT clan. Many of you do not understand the amount of time it takes to run this clan, Ledif spent hours in diplomacy with our neighbors, working up strats, and coordinating all of the RDDT clans on the global map. I can assure you that no matter how upset you are with not making top 5, he is that much more uspet. 

Ledif, I know you never asked to be commander, however you are doing a fantastic job.

***

People of RDDT (and NARWL and all the other RDDT clans),

I feel like by now, this should not come as a complete surprise. Before Saturday, June 8 at 7:06pm MST, I had kept my final decision to a very limited amount of people. In fact, up to that point, I had not shared my decision with any in the leadership. Like Klaus, I have decided to start a new tanking adventure, but this time with another clan. In the last few months, I have increasingly felt a need to diminish the amount of responsibility and corresponding stress that have followed me as a Deputy Commander and then as Commander of this fine clan. I want to start by making it clear that I had to make this decision at some point--this decision was coming. I finally decided late Friday night that it had to be now.

For 675 days, I have been a member of RDDT and a part of the growing and firmly established /r/worldoftanks community. For over 400 of those days I was in a leadership role of one sort or another. Essentially, my entire clan wars experience has been in an administrative and managerial role for this clan and community. This is by no means a frightful or bad thing, but rather something that I had wanted and enjoyed at the time. However, there comes to be a point when one may not want to make the final decisions anymore.

I have been incredibly taken with this clan and community. I have watched RDDT bloom from a third-rate, bottom tier African clan to a North American server Top 20 clan with a four or five month history of locking down a relatively large part of the European map. And not just RDDT. I have been there for the creation, development, and prosperity of an entire armada of RDDT clans. I believe that when RDDT first took up clan wars, there maybe only three clans belonging to the RDDT name. Since then, I have been involved--in some way or another--with the creation of every other RDDT-affiliated clan.

Upon becoming the Commander of RDDT, from the summer of 2012 to this past May, I have helped or taken the lead in the development of our TeamSpeak servers; hosted the Dropbox for which all of clan-sensitive information is stored; drew up many of our strats; entertained hundreds at numerous Community Nights; moderated r/worldoftanks; cemented the long-lasting relationship RDDT and NARWL now enjoy with Enjoy; oversaw the absorption of many prominent RNT players into RDDT; dealt with many problem-makers and community growing pains; promoted clear lines of communication with all RDDT clans; and linked thousands of twiddla and scribblar pages.

Leaving RDDT today, and writing this letter, is a very tough thing to do. I did not expect to have such a guiding hand in the fundamental development of this clan, subreddit, and community. I am absurdly lucky to have played such a role like I did. I have made so many friends and comrades throughout this community and especially in RDDT. I have had a brilliant experience in this clan and without it, I probably never would have stumbled onto reddit in the first place. I feel like I will leave in place a firmly established clan with a leadership structure designed to cope with even turnover like this. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly to me, the RDDT clan community now has a solid foundation for which it can find support with one another and each communicate as part of a great whole.

Truth be told, the Rise of the Americas event was to be the last campaign I would take a serious role in leading. This was decided by me many months back and only known to a very select few. Regardless of the upcoming Campaign (which will probably overshadow much of this letter), I have been looking for another tanking experience for quite a while. Now, and in a great deal due to Klaus’ departure, made the most sense to finally leave. Being in a primary leadership position for as long as I did made sense as I was mainly a university student with enough time to dedicate fully to commanding RDDT. Now with my graduation and a personal desire to start freeing up more time from World of Tanks, a drastic change is needed. However, and I do hope that you understand this, is that even if I was to back off to the position of Soldier, an underlying sense of duty and protective responsibility to RDDT would prohibit me from ever being totally relaxed. I care too much about what RDDT has become to simply sit on the sidelines. Unfortunately, this also has left me feeling—for a lack of a better word—trapped. Trapped in such a way that I feel like I must always be there for the clan to even function. I know that this is probably false, but it’s how I feel and because of it, I need a clan change. Few will know how much I had to struggle with this decision.

Please keep in mind that I am only the third in a (hopefully) very long line of RDDT prime commanders. I feel like there is no reason for my departure to amount to anything more than a long-time member looking for a change of pace. I have always maintained, throughout my entire existence in RDDT, that anyone, at any time, is completely welcome to leave and do what they think is best for themselves. I should hope that this same belief extends to me. I feel like there is no reason for any animosity towards me for making this personal decision, but if you feel like I’m a terrible person that’s up to you. I do hope to talk and tank with many of you in the future.

I’m certain there was so much more which I wanted to write, but I can't include everything.  All social RDDT clan leaders will need to remove me from their super secret subreddits.  As for me remaining as a moderator on r/worldoftanks, that should not be a problem (as we have always wanted non-RDDT clan moderators).  I will be online on our TS quite often to talk with anyone who wants to—even if it’s negative. I feel like I owe you even that.

Have a great day everyone and, for the record, I am truly sorry about my Canadianisms; it’s always been that way.

Regards,

1342703434.0,58,self.WorldofTanks,wtcv3,Welcome to r/WorldofTanks. A few things before you get started....,Vorkosigan,66,8,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/wtcv3/welcome_to_rworldoftanks_a_few_things_before_you/,"Hello everyone. The mod team here has seen a [massive jump](http://i.imgur.com/SgTry.jpg) in new people viewing the subreddit, and a corresponding jump in new posts. To simplify things, we have a few common questions and rules that I'd like to share. Most of this can be viewed on the sidebar, but I know people ignore that in favor of just posting a question. So!

* Joining a clan is as easy as clicking on the name in the sidebar, then clicking 'Join Clan' on right side of the page. Make sure that you're logged into your Tanks account, or you won't be able to see this. 

* Posting Rules: Anything related to tanks and World of Tanks is allowed. Don't post links to your .replay files (such as a mediafire link), make a self.post instead and describe (in more than 20 words) what people are going to be watching. Consider uploading your replays to YouTube instead.

    Now, there are a few caveats to this: If you're just posting random pics of tanks that are unrelated to the game, it's probably going to be removed. But if you went to Bovington or Aberdeen, and have some interesting pics of a JadgTiger or T95, that's ok. 

* And addendum to the posting rules: most screenshots will be downvoted unless they have something amazing in them. Most tankers have had games with over 4k doubled XP, 100k+ credits, and they do not impress people. You can still post them, but do not be surprised to have negative karma from them. 

* Section #4 on the sidebar lists a number of very useful information and statistics tools, including the WoT Dossier, Effeciency Calculator, Tankopedia, and more. If you have a new tool that isn't listed, please let us know. 

I'm sure there is more, and people are welcome to add comments and additional information. I'll add them to the OP if it's general enough.

It was a Jagdtiger 8.8, purchased after some research into the tier 8 premiums, and figuring that a fast rate of fire would be easier to get used to. I think we had tier 5 tanks tops at the time? It was back around 7 months or so ago. 

Anyways, after getting to tier 8, I can sympathize with both the relatively new players who I see asking which tier 8 premium is good, and all the players yelling ""NO DON'T."" I don't consider my current self a great player by any means, but I'm sure I would have done better not getting the Jagdtiger early. And just as important, I'd have been having a lot more fun if I played the Jagdtiger when I understand what tanks I'm fighting at tier 8, how the flow of higher games go, etc. 

The point that I'm taking too long to get to is that I don't see too many players in my situation commenting when someone with relatively few battles asks about tier 8 prems. It's usually more experienced players either simply saying ""No, you need to play more,"" or worse ""Don't ruin my tier 8 matches you idiot."" If someone new is reading this, I'd like to say this from one noob to another: think about why you're getting a premium before you get it. Because getting a tier 8 before you're comfortable with tier 8, or at least tier 7 battles is not pleasant. It's not even that useful for credits if you can't perform well. And if it's for fun, there are plenty of tanks within tier 5 or 6 that aren't too hard to get to that are quite enjoyable, while still getting you out of the low tier gameplay.

The following happens 90% of the time:

Around half to a majority of tanks go valley. They go to the crest. They get shot at. They stall. If they push, they get cut down by defenders. Meanwhile, town is weak and cannot hold. Town falls, the enemy push onto your cap, you lose.

Even if the tanks in valley manage to push through, it doesn't work. Enemy eliminates meager town force, and head back to defend. Valley push stalls and either dies right there or the enemy sends a couple of tanks to cap out.

Lately we have noticed a trend where people will post an end-of-game scoreboard only to have it brutally downvoted. I just wanted to take some time and help clear things up for those who are new.

In the rules, we have stated:

&gt;End of game score cards are allowed but please note, most screenshots will be downvoted unless they have something amazing in them.

In theory, they're allowed and the moderators here will not remove your submission. In practice, the average submission has negative link karma.

No one cares when you show off the scoreboard that says that you got 8 kills. There is not a story behind this image. Sure, you can post in the comments, but that is not exactly good practice as people will often skip comments and go directly to downvoting.

A much better post would be a self post that tells the story of how you got those 8 kills and adding something like a [STORY INSIDE] to your post. Context is very important when submitting content. Lets be honest here, a great majority of players here have had 8 kill games, we want to know what makes your story **different**.

A great example is this [submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/158l4o/one_man_army_story_mode/) by reddittor /u/Mrs_Brisby.

We have added the following text in the [yellow box](http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/submit) when submitting a direct link to help clear things up:

&gt;Posting an end-of-game scoreboard? Make a text post, and tell us your story instead! Include your image in the text.

As always your feedback is welcome. We are not going to ban these from the subreddit outright as they are an integral part of the game and can be great tools for quickly sharing content.
