PLEASE READ.,razorsheldon,2119,714,1364,http://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/vbfxq/call_to_arms_please_read/,"Tonight I came home to a disturbing video of a group of middle school students ridiculing and harassing an older bus monitor.  Tomorrow, this will have gone viral.

[WARNING, THIS IS UNPLEASANT TO WATCH](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=l93wAqnPQwk#!)

[Here is the reddit thread that was removed from /r/videos](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/vb5gj/kids_call_bus_monitor_fat_until_she_cries_and/)

Now, as awful as this was, there was a silver lining in not only the universal condemnation of the actions of these kids, but also in a call for support for this poor woman.

Her name is Karen, and she has been a widow for 17 years, has lived in the same town she grew up in and is about to have her 50th high school reunion in the same school district, and deserves so much better than the actions shown by those in this video.  Let's figure out ways to show her that there are still good people out there...

A [redditor](http://www.reddit.com/user/Heavyballsareheavy) has established an indiegogo account to collect donations.  I can offer no assurances that these funds will reach her, but will make sure to update this thread once verification is obtained.  In the meantime, if you would still like to donate, here is the link:

**[KAREN FUNDRAISER](http://www.indiegogo.com/loveforkarenhklein)**  **UPDATE $642,200 as of 8:30pm PST on 6/24!**

**[KINDNESS FOR KAREN FACEBOOK SUPPORT PAGE](http://www.facebook.com/KindnessForKaren)**

**This post is for supporting Karen, not for discussing vengeance or revenge towards those responsible.  The goal is to turn this from a sad and disturbing story to an uplifting story of worldwide support.**

**[Reporter interviews Karen](http://rochester.ynn.com/content/top_stories/588771/police-investigate-alleged-bullying-incident-involving-school-bus-monitor/)**

**[NICE RECAP FROM HUFFPO](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/20/greece-school-district-bullied-footage-causes-outrage_n_1612925.html)** - thanks [Mysterian](http://www.reddit.com/user/Mysterian)

As the media storm continues, I think we as a community have done a tremendous job in finding the silver lining to this sad story and showing her that kindness and compassion do exist.  For anybody that questions whether she really deserved this outpouring of support, I will simply define her character by one of her facebook posts from almost 2 years ago:  http://i.imgur.com/aSppX.png

We have recently had a big surge of new subscribers to this great community, and I've gotten a big kick out of hearing all the positive feedback regarding how it has felt to suddenly be exposed to so many great tales of humanity.  

May we all share and enjoy many more great stories like these together... Now I have 2 very brief and important favors/updates to ask/share with you all. 

**IMPORTANT STORY ONE:**

/u/ehcolem has done a tremendous job recently of finding and sharing great stories for this subreddit that we all love and enjoy.  In fact, I just realized that he is 3 months shy of celebrating his 7th year cakeday on reddit, meaning he has probably seen an incredible amount of horrible memes and moderator drama in his ripe old reddit age and we are blessed he hasn't fled years ago.  

That being said, he asked me personally to ""like"" a page on a FaceBook fundraiser so he could achieve a $10,000 stem cell grant for him and his daughter, and I figured it would be much better served by opening it up to this community to do so as well.  So if you are so inclined, please click on this link and ""Like"" or ""Vote"" for the cause listed and hopefully good things will happen:  http://on.fb.me/RCJ1l7


**IMPORTANT STORY TWO:**

The second update is one many of you are familiar with, and has been featured here multiple times. ""Cain's Arcade"" was an incredible tale of a creative young 9-year old, and his happenstance encounter with a budding and talented filmmaker.  Well, that filmmaker, /u/nirvan has been a redditor for over 2 years now, and recently dropped by our small subreddit to answer questions and help promote the next phase of this incredible story.  Please [watch this great video if you haven't before,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ul9c-4dX4Hk) and share any feedback you think is relevant.  Also, mark your calendar for this global upcoming event on October 6th and feel free to get others involved!

Thanks again for being awesome people, and I apologize in advance for the lack of brevity or tl;dr in this announcement.  I can assure you that these are fairly rare and that most of the time you'll only see awesome stories featured here.

Yours truly,

1338851558.0,523,self.UpliftingNews,ul2c4,STATE OF THE SUBREDDIT ADDRESS:,razorsheldon,564,41,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/ul2c4/state_of_the_subreddit_address/,"Before I begin, let me get the customary **“please upvote this, I don’t get karma blah blah blah”** bit out of the way so others have a better chance of seeing it.

-Did you actually click on that upward facing arrow over there so it turned orange, or did you just read that last paragraph and move on to this one?  Don’t worry, I can’t tell either way, I just wanted you to stop for a moment and think about it.-

What began 19 days ago as a simple idea to have an escape from the depressing, sensational news and instead focus on uplifting examples of inspiration and compassion from around the world, has morphed into a rapidly growing community with over 100 stories, 2,500 subscribers and countless other readers/lurkers.  And what a community it is!  Initially consisting mostly of people coming from /r/WTF , we have added subscribers from a variety of other subreddits, ranging from /r/aww to /r/depression .  You all have not only gotten along well with each other, but have maintained the positivity and uplifting attitudes implied by the mission statement without any rules and hardly any moderation.  Based on what I have seen in other subreddits, this is no small feat!

So the question I pose to all of you now is, how would you like to see this little subreddit grow, evolve, change etc…?  I’m not the power-trip type and karma is only relevant to me to see what kind of stories seem to resonate with people, so feel free to voice your opinion and share your ideas here in the comments.

The one favor I ask of you is to share any stories you encounter in the future that you think might be a good fit here.  Sadly, searching for good, quality, uplifting stories is harder then one might expect.  Simply search for “good Samaritan” in Google news, and you’ll notice half of the articles will be about somebody getting mugged, taken advantage of, or even killed for their actions.  I’ve had some success searching news for certain key words such as “kindness,” “community rallied,” “heartwarming” etc… so feel free to use this tactic to source your stories.

Actually, I told a tiny lie.  I have one other favor to ask.  If you happen across a post or comment in another subreddit that would tie in well here, feel free to reference this community.  Think of how it was you found out about this place and if you are comfortable with it, feel free to share this sub in a similar way with others.  The more people we get here, the more exposure we’ll get to great stories we might not know about or that don’t pop up in Google searches.  

That’s about all I can think of for now.  In the future it might be fun to open up discussion for ways we all have improved our attitudes, or examples of situations where we have been more positive as a result of this subreddit, but that is probably for another time.  Thanks for subscribing, thanks for your support, and thanks for making this a great community.

We are nearing our 1,000th story featured here, we recently surpassed 20,000 subscribers, and we will have hit 1 million total page views within the month.

What began as an idea for a centralized place to simply share or locate a feel-good news story suddenly became ground zero for [supporting a bullied bus monitor](http://www.dailydot.com/society/behind-uplifting-news-reddit-interview/), raising global awareness for a [kind gesture by a Houston BBQ restaurant owner](http://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/13hnzp/this_guy_owns_a_restaurant_that_consistently_gets/), and [rallying funds for a new family](http://www.dailydot.com/society/karl-kesel-comics-adoption-crowdtilt/) for reasons that just felt right, among many other ‘uplifting’ stories and causes.

So during this Holiday Season I want to thank you for your support, your participation, and your compassion for other living creatures on this planet.  It has been a fun ride so far, and I’m looking forward to continuing this journey with all of you.  And as a small token of thanks, I will be offering some “BestOf” awards in the coming weeks once I figure out the categories and the most optimal ways to vote.  If you have any ideas or suggestions on this front, please feel free to leave them here in the comments.    

Thanks again, razorsheldon

**MODERATOR UPDATE:**

I'm still the only human moderator in here, which I wanted to clarify because it has caused some confusion in the past.  The other names you see are the reddit accounts of Chris Kluwe, Zach Braff and Allie Brosh, whom I added for kicks a few months ago.  I'm pretty sure none of them are even aware of this place, but if you send us a modmail message, there is always a slim chance one of them might see it!  Otherwise they just go to me, and I usually enjoy them.

**UPLIFTING REDDIT:**

Now as a few of the older members here know, every now and then I highlight a cool example of reddit rallying around some worthy cause or person, and to celebrate our 25,000th subscriber, I thought I'd draw attention to a developing ""uplifting news"" story.

**Darien Long** is a self-employed mall manager in a gritty area in Atlanta, GA.  Over the past year, he has single-handedly been on a mission to rid his neighborhood of violent and agressive drug dealers.  Recently, 3 videos recorded in May of last year went viral, which showed the difficulties he faced dealing with these dangerous trouble makers.

I won't link these videos here because there is nothing uplifting about them, however after going viral, the local news station WSB-TV did the following interview with him and his attitude, calm demeanor and slight stature really resonated with a lot of people: 

**[News Story](http://www.wsbtv.com/videos/news/residents-say-crime-is-keeping-people-from/vpWJb/)**

So today, redditor u/RyuKenya [stumbled upon him at his mall](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/17nbpt/so_i_found_kickass_mall_cop_in_atlanta_told_him/c8728p2), spoke to him, described all of the great people on reddit that support him, and created this fundraiser to get him new gear, a vacation, a few cases of beer, or whatever he wants:  

**https://www.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/this-fund-is-for-darien-long-kick-ass-mall-cop#community**

Sure, Darien was just doing what he gets paid to do, but I always find it uplifting when redditors rally around somebody like this and figured it was worth sharing.

1366739783.0,322,self.UpliftingNews,1cy721,[MOD UPDATE] &amp; CALL TO ARMS #3 - please upvote for visibility,razorsheldon,385,63,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/1cy721/mod_update_call_to_arms_3_please_upvote_for/,"**WELCOME TO THOSE NEW TO R/UPLIFTINGNEWS!**

The horrific events of last week were a stark reminder that there are still people out there willing to terrorize and kill innocent civilians.  But more importantly, we were also reminded that there are far more people out there willing to help others in need.  A number of stories of heroism and courage emerged from the tragedy, and the worldwide support and solidarity helped us all take humanity back from those seeking to destroy it. 

I'm well aware that these events brought many new folks to this little corner of the internet seeking more positive, feel-good news stories, and hopefully you were able to find some and choose to stick around.  It has been great to see so many new people posting such inspiring stories and videos, and I really hope this trend continues.  

I've always purposely avoided posting rules and guidelines for stories and comments here because it should be fairly obvious, but I do moderate a decent amount and work hard to try to keep this place positive and free of the unhealthy cynicism and negativity found throughout the site and internet at large.  So please be mindful that a lot of people count on this place as an escape, and use it to balance out the harsh realities of the world the news tends to remind us of every day.

---

**CALL TO ARMS #3**

Now those that have been here a while know that every now and then we react to a story and take a bit of action as a community, and now that the dust has settled from last week's events I wanted to circle back to a suggestion made by /u/creativezen that we try to rally behind the efforts to award Carlos Arredondo the Presidential Citizens Medal for exemplary deeds at the Boston Marathon.

**[CLICK HERE FOR PETITION LINK](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/award-carlos-arredondo-presidential-citizens-medal-exemplary-deeds-boston-marathon-april-15-2013/kcS2CGm2)**

All you need to do is click on this link to register/sign the petition, and if 100,000 signatures are obtained, the Obama Administration will address this worthwhile effort.  More importantly, after clicking on the link, please feel free to share it with colleagues, friends and family if you are so compelled, so more people can assist in recognizing his heroic act that day.

Carlos has had an interesting, tragic and controversial past which is well documented [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Arredondo), [here](http://lightbox.time.com/2013/04/18/the-hero-in-the-cowboy-hat-carlos-arredondos-story-by-eugene-richards/?iid=lf%7Caround#1) and [here](http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2013/04/marathon_rescuer_gets_attention_from_press_and_fbi), but none of this is terribly relevant to his actions that day.

At a time when nearly everybody was running away from the explosion, Carlos ran towards it, and his heroism was captured on film:  http://imgur.com/a/HXLyP  

His quick actions and disregard for his own safety arguable saved the life of Jeff Bauman, and he made us all proud to know there were people like that out there that might be there for us if we are ever in a similar position in need of help.

So please consider signing the petition and sharing it with others to show your support that his actions be recognized.  As for some of the victims of the tragedy, there has been a tremendous outpouring of financial support so far, and if you feel so inclined to contribute to these efforts as well, I have summarized a list of all legitimate fundraisers that I'm aware of, and will edit in any more that are discovered later:

* [Jeff Bauman](http://www.gofundme.com/BucksforBauman)

* [Celeste and Sydney](http://www.gofundme.com/CelesteandSydney)

* [David Henneberry](https://www.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/lets-fix-david-henneberrys-boat-that-got-ruined-in-the-boston-bombers-standoff/)

* [The One Fund](https://onefundboston.org/)

**http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/steve_duin/index.ssf/2012/08/steve_duin.html**

After reading it, it is difficult not to feel moved and to want to do something to help.  When I looked at how his collection was selling here:  http://www.blastoffcomics.com/products-page/the-karl-kesel-collection/, I noticed a sale here and there, but I also saw that a lot of his collection remained unsold and a thought occurred to me.

Why not start a fundraising campaign to buy as many of his comics as we could so we could give them right back to him?  I have no lofty expectations for this endeavor, but I thought even purchasing one comic would send the right message that there are people out there that are grateful that people like Karl and his wife Myrna exist to make this world a better place.

So if you feel so inclined, please feel free to contribute to the campaign I have established here:

**[HELP KARL KESEL KEEP HIS COMIC BOOK COLLECTION](https://www.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/help-karl-kesel-keep-his-comic-collection)** 

My understanding is that crowdtilt is the official group funding partner of reddit, and I will make sure to work closely with them to ensure all funds go to the purchase of Karl's collection, and/or Karl himself at the conclusion of this fundraiser.  I don't have a facebook account aside from the shell I created to register /r/UpliftingNews but I can assure you that this is legitimate and am happy to verify information for people with concerns.

Depending on the amount raised, I will also plan to seek feedback from knowledgable collectors to ensure the money is spent wisely and the comics are purchased according to priority, and perhaps even work with Karl directly.

There is no contribution that is too small, and feel free to share this with anybody else you think might be moved to help out.

Let's make this happen!

EDIT:  So I just realized that the current Crowdtilt setup is $5,000 or nothing, meaning if the 7 days expire and it hasn't hit $5,000, no money is raised and nobody is charged anything (but Karl gets nothing either).  No big deal, but I guess I'll have to gauge the progress and see if a smaller target amount is more attainable.  Sorry for the confusion there.  If we do ""tilt"" I'll simply create another one.

**UPDATE: 8/27**  Crowdtilt has graciously allowed me to lower the target amount to ensure funds are raised and comics are purchased for the Kesel Family.  

In addition, I have been in contact with Steve Duin, who wrote the excellent piece in the Oregonian and who is an avid comic collector himself. He was very pleased that his story was making the rounds, and is glad to hear that it moved strangers around the globe to want to help.

I have also had some great conversations with Amy of the “I Love Comics” store located in Vancouver, WA. Amy is one of Karl’s personal friends, and is hosting their annual Summer Hullabaloo for an extra day to help raise money for the Kesel family. Here is the FB event page with relevant details if anybody in the greater Portland area wants to participate: http://www.facebook.com/events/388893731164439/

More importantly, Amy has offered her expertise and personal knowledge of Karl to ensure we buy the right comics that are still available once the fundraiser is over. This way, we can all be assured we aren’t sending him back comics he was happy to get rid of, or are buying random issues that have no cohesion.

So the plan now is for the fundraiser to end Friday, for funds to settle shortly thereafter, for Amy to provide a list of comics to buy on Monday based on the total funding raised, and for me to purchase said comics from the site and ship them back to Karl.

**http://teespring.com/UpliftingNews**

I can't think of a better win/win for the r/UpliftingNews community.  

* A really cool, really affordable, high-quality shirt?  Check.  

* A fashion statement that lets others know you love reddit and good things that happen to good people?  You bet.  

* 100% of profits ($6 per shirt) going to a charity that ALSO donates 100% of proceeds to the ultimate beneficiaries?  Home Run.

A huge thank you to /u/licenseplate for the incredible design, Walker Williams at teespring for helping us with such a great platform, and reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian for the introductions and continued support for this community.  In addition, the wonderful folks here at reddit were kind enough to waive their licensing fee to support this initiative.

This is a limited time offer, so get them while you can!  Now if anybody would really like one but is facing financial hardships at the moment, leave a note here or PM me and perhaps we can figure out a way to get one in your hands.

In other great news, [the fundraiser for Frankie's new canopy](https://reddit.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/help-frankie-get-his-canopy/description) was a huge success.  A big thanks to all that contributed to this great cause, and a special shout out to the guys at crowdtilt for contributing themselves and helping out with the campaign.  The wire was sent yesterday and should be in Frankie's hands by Monday.  I just spoke to him, and he is overwhelmed by the support of strangers and thrilled people were willing to help.

Lastly, I'm taking applications for additional moderators.  If you're interested, send me a few reasons why through this [contact the moderators link](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FUpliftingNews).  Any posts on this topic here will be removed, so if you're interested, just follow the link.  No prior moderating experience is required.

1368204846.0,227,self.UpliftingNews,1e2t5x,Let's help make another Uplifting story,razorsheldon,258,31,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/1e2t5x/lets_help_make_another_uplifting_story/,"Inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1e28gf/4_year_old_kara_has_cerebral_palsy_hydrocephalous/) in /r/assistance, I discovered a 16 year-old girl is rallying votes so her teacher can win a contest for a wheelchair accessible van in order to drive her disabled young daughter to the hospital for her weekly visits.

For some reason this really struck a chord... especially since /r/pics downvoted all her comments and didn't seem terribly supportive.  Rather than give up, this 16 year-old took the feedback in stride and posted to more appropriate subreddits.  I'm thinking that is exactly the kind of selfless character and positive personality this subreddit likes to embrace, so I figured it was worth highlighting here.

I looked into the contest to make sure it seemed legit, and I believe it is.  The top 5% of entrants with the most total votes will be eligible for 1 van, with the winner selected by a group of qualified judges to determine the biggest need.  So don't worry about the impact of voting for one cause over another, as the judges will be the one determining the winner.

Here's the link, feel free to vote if so inspired.  Voting ends today.

It costs nothing to enter, and they are offering some neat prizes for both the best individual and the best subreddit picks.

We have a great community here, so I figured I'd add us to the list of competing subreddits.  In order for /r/UpliftingNews to qualify for these prizes though, we will need at least 10 of you to enter their picks through the following link:  

**http://tournament.fantasysports.yahoo.com/t1/register/joinprivategroup_assign_team?GID=70615&amp;P=reddit**

**(Group Number is 70615 and the password is reddit in case you have issues with this link)**

Prizes include bragging rights, reddit gold and Amazon gift cards, and I'll add some fun prizes and flair as well for the group if more than 10 people enter.  Now if that doesn't sway you, Yahoo is also offering $10,000 for the winning bracket out of all entries on their site!

Even if you know nothing about college basketball, there is no downside to filling out a bracket and it is a lot of fun cheering for your picks and following the results.  Supposedly, this year has more parity among teams than any other year, so living in another country or not following basketball might even give you an edge!

I have linked the relevant reddit post below with full contest rules and prize details, but here is a quick summary:

* Click on the link above to join the group, and enter your Yahoo *account's* username/password (not the one referenced in bold).  If you don't have a Yahoo account, you will need to create one.

* Enter your reddit username as the name of your bracket.  This is important, and can result in disqualification if these names don't match.  Also, your account will need to be older than one month old to qualify.

* Follow the Yahoo prompts to fill out your bracket and enter the tie breaker prediction.   The deadline for submitting your picks is 12:15 EDT on Thursday , March 21st, so make sure you select your picks before then.

* Good luck and have fun!

P.S.  Feel free to ask any questions in the comments of this thread.  I'll do my best to answer them, though I won't offer any clues who I'm picking to win it all!

The story behind it isn't so feel-good (apologies). I follow the adoption blogs of people adopting special needs children from countries in which special needs orphans aren't given the care they need. As a result, their disabilities grow and it becomes even less likely that they will ever be adopted. Though it's sad these places exist, I love following the adoption blogs because there are so many happy stories on there and you get to watch watch previously sick and sad children bloom before your eyes.

My favorite is Katie.

[This](http://theblessingofverity.com/wp-content/uploads/797_25.05.2009_Veronika044-450x506.jpg) is Katie before she was adopted. She's *9-years-old* in this photograph. She has down syndrome, but she's also suffering from severe neglect and malnourishment.

[This](http://theblessingofverity.com/wp-content/uploads/2012-07-17-001-2012-07-17-003-450x600.jpg) is Katie after living with her adopted family for less than a year.

Though there is damage that can't be undone, seeing her sweet smile and chubby little arms is so heartwarming. Her physical improvements are partially evidence of better medical care and better nutrition, but also of the dedication and love that her family has put into caring for her.

The blog can be found here, if you're interested in reading more: [The Blessing of Verity](http://theblessingofverity.com/). It's very religious. I'm non-religious and don't agree with the family on all their views, but the message of sacrificing time and effort for the ones who can't help themselves is so inspiring to me. I'm just so happy that people this generous exist in the world.",,False,self,t5_2u3ta,False,,,True,t3_x0jmg,http://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/x0jmg/little_girl_with_down_syndrome_is_adopted_these/,

The woman, Maria Kristensen, is 31 weeks pregnant, so she is able to feed the girl breastmilk while they put they baby in the cab, put on aircon and pour water on her.
At first the girl doesn't respond, but after a short while, she startet eating and coming back to life.

""There was life in her eyes. She looked around, and we thougt 'oh my god'. She was still all bloody, a day old maximum. And she had some paper rapped around her navel. It was properly a mother who had been powerless and did the best she could, says Maria Kristensen.

The baby was then brought to the local police station.

Full disclosure - Dave Nazaroff (the NYC man on the bike) is my cousin, and a great guy. 

Some time ago, his wife, Kaete, heard of a young boy named Tripp Halstead who got injured whilst playing outside. A branch fell on him, and he suffered a traumatic brain injury. 

Tripp's mom started posting updates online, and this touched Kaete deeply, and she and Dave started discussing how they could help. 

From this, the TOGA Multisport Ride To Give was created! 

Donations were gathered, plans were made, and the event was in motion!

Dave will be riding over 900 miles, leaving from West Nyack, NY and arriving in Winder, GA. 

Dave left this morning, and he can use all the support that you guys can give! The plan is to arrive in 5-6 days, weather permitting. 

Dave is a 7-Time Ironman, and would love your support!

Here are some shots from the departure, taken by my mother:

He then thanked my husband for his service, and said it was the least he could do. We thanked him profusely and were really moved by his kindness and generosity.
