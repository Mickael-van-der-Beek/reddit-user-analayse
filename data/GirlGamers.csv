1370065004.0,293,self.GirlGamers,1fg9r1,To gamer girls: My thoughts on the comments I received regarding my Portal Bedroom post on /r/gaming,BlondeChell,336,43,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1fg9r1/to_gamer_girls_my_thoughts_on_the_comments_i/,"I've seen/personally received messages from a few of you that were quite bothered and/or upset by the ""top"" comments that my Portal Bedroom received on the gaming subreddit.

I know a majority of the top comments were rather brainless, but I was actually pleasantly surprised by the number of positive comments I did receive regarding the post. Yes, unfortunately the ""top"" comments were either focused on my gender, or my sex/lack-of-sex life, but those comments were a dime a dozen, and were quite easy to skim over, because there was no actual thought or constructive criticism within them.

Large subreddits will always be at-risk to anonymous groupthink. I can honestly say I will fall asleep tonight (in my portal room!) without dwelling over any of these ""sex-life"" comments (although I will confess some of them WERE pretty hilarious).

What will stick in my head in the long-run, however, will be the thought-out positive comments, constructive criticisms (the rooms not perfect, I'm always open to learning how I can improve at something!), and the messages from people (guys and girls alike) saying that I did a great job and should be proud of my artistic talent. Interior design, by standards, is not a guy-oriented hobby, so I knew that by posting it in a male-dominated subreddit, actually focusing and critiquing on the details of the room would quickly get lost within more predictable comment threads.   

I used that subreddit as a tool to present one of my pieces of gaming art (yes, I consider interior design ""art"") to the community. There were negative comments, yes. But that's not what I'll take from my post. What I will take from it, is what spawned from my post:

http://blog.gamefreaks.co.nz/post/51825372405/reddit-user-blondechell-has-created-the-ultimate

Hopefully all those links work, but my point is, I've received WAY more emails requesting permission to re-post my album, inquiries on how I made something specific, or if they could interview me for an article or commission me for a future art project. I received way more of those messages than I did any ""YOU'RE A VIRGIN NECKBEARD O WAIT YOU'RE A HAWT GURL LOLZ I HAS A PENUS!""

There are always going to be people that have something negative to say. Some people still even have the mindset that your gender determines what you can and can't be good at. Don't listen to them, and try to not be like any of those people. Instead, be the kind of person Wil Wheaton says to be:

“There’s going to be a thing in your life that you love, and I don’t know what it’s going to be. It might be sports, it might be science, it might be reading, it might be fashion design, it might be building things, it might be telling stories or taking pictures. It doesn’t matter what it is…The way you love that, and the way that you find other people who love it too is what makes being a nerd awesome. And don’t ever let anyone tell you that the thing that you love is a thing you can’t love. Don’t ever let anyone tell you that you can’t love that because “that’s for boys,” that you have to love this, cause you’re a girl. You find the things that you love, and you love them the most that you can!”

We are a subreddit dedicated to females that love the world of video gaming. That bothers some people, especially on Reddit, but I guarantee you any hobby that exists, there are people out there that try to tear down those that enjoy that hobby, whether it's video games, composing music, fixing cars, knitting, playing sports, reading... the only way one can avoid negative criticism is to not be passionate about anything in life.

I know it can be discouraging as a community to have our interests and hobbies mocked, especially when some people rationalize that they can mock us simply because of our gender. I just want you to know that I, personally, will remember the encouragement I received from THIS subreddit, my blog, and the multiple websites that linked to my blog saying ""Look at this 'cause this is awesome!"" than I will any ""BEWBZ!"" comment that was posted today.

So whatever passions you have, whether it's gaming, designing shoes, fanfiction, whatever it is, take it and run with it, and don't let negative criticism or people drag you down, because they aren't the ones worth focusing on.

Game on girls!

Okay so a bit of background, I'm an MTF trans, I stream league of legends on a daily basis, You may have seen my post on here a while back. I was googling my IGN the other day just to see where i show up etc. I noticed i was on this website called ggdb.net. Being curious i clicked on it and had a look, to my surprise it was a ""Girl Gamer databse"" site which showcased streams with low viewers. I decided to email them to thank them for having me on there out of manners and the such. They respond to me, notifying me that i had been removed from there, and the rest, well, have a read for yourselves. http://imgur.com/4jsUm41

1372827910.0,235,self.GirlGamers,1hjs79,"Was just invited to an Xbox Live Party where I was threatened with rape and the murder of my family...(Possible NSFW, language).",Sieberella,273,38,154,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1hjs79/was_just_invited_to_an_xbox_live_party_where_i/,"Hey ladies (and gents). So I'm playing Skyrim, minding my own and I get a party invite from someone not on my friends list. Now, this is not unusual. I post quite a bit on the X360A forums for boosting and parties and such so I figure it's someone that wants to boost, or it's one of my friend's friends.

I join the party and am instantly greeted with ""Hey! Want to suck my dick?"" I look in the party and there's about five guys in there just screaming things like ""Hey are you a good cook? Cause I need a woman that can cook me a meal and suck my cock"" and repetitive things of that nature. So I start drowning them out and start Filing Complaints on them because I know it's just a matter of time before they kick me from the party and move on to some other girl to do this to. I figure if we can get enough complaints filed they'll get kicked off.

I'm going through ignoring the ""Why aren't you talking? Are you too busy sucking cock to talk to us?"" when it goes a step too far. I hear ""Dude, her gamer score is 53,000! How much dick did you suck to get that? I bet she's fat! Let's look her up on Facebook!"" Followed quickly by a 'yeah, then let's find out where she lives and rape her and kill her whole family' *annoying laughter* I'm then kicked from the party.

I managed to file a complaint on all of them but was unable to write down their names. They sounded about my age (mid 20's). I just couldn't believe it! I mean I've had my fair share of ""Oh shit, you're a girl? Wanna suck me off?"" But to invite a woman into a chat party and then say you're going to stalk her, rape her and kill her family just goes completely beyond!

I didn't know any of their names, and I don't know if there's a way to look up who you've been in parties with because they aren't showing up in my recent players list...because I was playing Skyrim and they were in COD: BLOPS2 so we never played together. I just couldn't believe this! 

Trying to cool down a bit and enjoy my game but I'm thinking gaming is a little ruined for me tonight. I just had to share so if any of my other fellow ladies are on XBL and get a party chat from someone you don't know, just don't accept it. I'm going to stop, which sucks because I like to chat and have a good time, but this is unacceptable.

TLDR; Received party invite from someone I didn't know, five guys proceeded to tell me what a slut I probably am and told me they would find me, rape me and kill my whole family.

**Edit; Holy cow. Went to bed and woke up to a lot of comments. Thanks for the support team. I'll try and respond to everyone today.**

**Edit 2:** To answer some common questions I'm seeing: Xbox Live does have a ""Recently Played With"" list, but it's just that, you had to have played in a game with them for them to show up in that list. To just be invited to party, they wouldn't show up.

Because they wouldn't show up in my ""Recently Played With"" I had to stay in the chat to be able to report them all. Once they were out of the party the names would be gone and I wouldn't be able to report.",,True,nsfw,t5_2rfec,1372871261.0,,xbox,True,t3_1hjs79,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1hjs79/was_just_invited_to_an_xbox_live_party_where_i/,

I am from small Europe country and I work here as TV host of a gaming show. When I started, there was a big hate about me among fans – they didn’t believe that I play games (which is ridiculous because I work as a gaming journalist for more than 8 years). 

Some of them know that I play games, but I play only on consoles, which is something that has brutal casual stigma here - you are not a gamer if you play on consoles. (BTW they also thought that I am too fat for being at TV. One guy said that he wants to vomit everytime he sees my big butt – LOL :D). 

There were also some troubles with production, so I slowly started to feel quite bad about the work. 

Anyway… Yesterday I had a meeting with guy from PR agency that makes PR activity for Microsoft here. And they offer me to officially cosplay Cortana for next Halo! OMG!! They don’t want any model, they want someone, who knows the game, who plays on consoles (yeah, so satisfying) and they don’t want any other girl. So COOL! I just feel great. 

TLDR; Local Microsoft offer me to officially cosplay Cortana for next Halo, because I know the game (and despite the fact that I have not a body size of a fashion model) – so I am fu*ing happy :D

It is the entire reason I try not to post self pics in /gaming. They act as if this is totally normal (the people who do it, not the entire subreddit) and part of protocol.

See a woman? Better try to sexually humiliate her! And every time I see this shit, I'm always the only one who reported it. I am not going to link to it because I don't want it to be seen, but this is so shitty. It is one thing to be shitty to women, it is another to constantly and systematically try and sexually humiliate every woman who posts there. 

I remember I crossed out my name from that fad of posting your new facebook profiles and made a funny post about mass effect. They traced my profile (they had done that to NONE of the other facebook posts that had guys in them) and posted all my personal information in the thread and thought it was funny/cool. This post didn't have my face in it or anything. It had one tiny peice of info that hinted I might be a woman and they all posted my person info. Not only that, they posted my friends info as well because she happened to like a lot of my gaming stuff on my facebook.

And what was worse is that they blamed me for it, for not being set to private/unsearchable. When really it was a glitch of facebook that happened when to switched to the timeline. I had my profile set to unsearchable, it was facebook that fucked up. So it was my fault that I was asking for attention for a post where I hid my identity and they had dug up my info and posted it. 


Just fucking why. Why be so shitty? JUST WHY!?

So I was at Entertainmart with a male friend (his sex is relevant to this story), waiting in line because we were selling back some movies, when I spotted a Chrome 360 controller. Wondered about it, mainly if it were real (because this store produces knock-off controllers), and we started talking about it. I mentioned how I broke mine, needed a replacement, and was interested in that one because of the improved D-pad. My friend didn't know, as he didn't have a 360, and it was pretty obvious to any eavesdroppers that I was the one who had the console and wanted the controller.

This other guy, with his girlfriend, also waited in line near us, and he turned to us and mentioned how it was a poor controller because it sucks up battery like nothing else and the D-pad wasn't worth it.

Except, when he told ""us,"" he wasn't talking to me at all. He was talking to my friend. In fact, he didn't give me a second glance. It was as if I wasn't even there.
 
He recommended the other Xbox controller and started talking about the charge pack, and my friend kept saying, ""yeah, I don't know anything about it, I don't have an Xbox, she's the one who needs another controller,"" and this guy continued to talk to him as if I were invisible. As if it were impossible that I needed a controller, let alone played 360.

This entire ordeal, as minor as it is, bothered the shit out of me.

I saw a pink, glittery display, a bright sign with barbie heads that read ""Girl Games"" and all I see in the shelf are Barbie games, games ending with Z, and all the casual and shovel ware imaginable.

I face-palmed at the sight. I really don't know if its the store's idea or corporate to market games this way to girls. My buddy went in and asked for any new games, he got pointed to the sign up sheet for The Last of Us pre-order.

I really don't know what to say. Why didn't I get pointed to the sign up sheet? Because I have tits, and lack a penis? I got the pen and proceeded to sign my info when dude at the corner said, ""Uh, this isn't probably for you.There's new games at the shelf I pointed at, we have the new Adventure Time Collectors Edition.""

The best part of this all, is that my friend squealed at the news and went to grab the game. I just left and went back to my old game store.

Story time!,Lexi_Like_Crazy,190,41,150,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1hkwly/im_a_transsexual_female_gamer_just_joined_and_am/,"Here is the book I wrote you all. I hope it gets read. &gt;.&lt;;; Validation at the bottom!

Hello everyone! I'm a transsexual 24 year old girl. I've been living full time as a woman in public for a few years now. I've been on estrogen for almost 2.

My testosterone is in female range now, and so are my E levels! Super excited. I feel great. :3 Except for one thing. This is rare among trans women but my body is responding so strongly to the hormones that I now get intense bloating, cramps and pms once a month. Like my body knows what should be happening. It sucks. It hurts. How do you deal with it? I basically just...don't do anything. Curl up and watch tv until its over. 5 days usually...Last time it was 8... Ugh...

Anyway,

""The Surgery"" is one year from now. I'm so excited to finally be content with my physical body. ^_^

Right. So that's me on one level. Here's who I actually am as a person:

I love gaming. I've been gaming since I was little. My first game was the first Sonic the Hedgehog on my Sega Genesis. I am obsessed with Final Fantasy 7. (I recognize it isn't the best in the series but I was a little kid whenI first played it, it was my first RPG. It wins over all. That and Kingdom Hearts.) I'm currently learning to code and am planning on breaking into the game industry. That is daunting but it's what I want to do.

I always got teased by my friends and other people for my girlishness. I've always been a girly girl since I was old enough to express gender of any degree. I love pink and am bouncy and generally happier than I've ever been. 

Some trans people retain a lot of masculinity during transition. I...haven't. My ""masculinity"" was an act to protect myself. I'm really girly. So please understand I'm not acting like a girl. I'm just being me. Your rules made me feel really comfortable. ^_^

I love meeting people. I'm kind of afraid of competitive online gaming. It's something I used to love but have grown more and more away from. When I was practicing my voice, in order to do it in a ""safe"" space I practiced online. 

At first I got called gay. Then I was insulted for being a 12 year old.

When I started getting sexual advances and threats of rape I knew I must be doing pretty good. :P

Honestly in the years Ive been passing and blending in as a woman, I've experienced two kinds of discrimination. One based on me being trans when I was earlier transition, and now most commonly discrimination from all places for my being female. 

It has been eye opening to go from a straight white male to a bisexual female. Giving up that privilege...The instantaneous differences. It was shocking. Even though I've always felt like a girl. The world didn't see me that way. So I had no frame of reference for the difficulties. I've learned a  lot in a short time. I feel like it's made me so much stronger and more capable as a person to overcome things like gender discrimination. To fight through them.

It may be why I have gravitated away from online gaming. The things men say to me online... Jesus. [Sieberella's post is an extreme case but sadly so accurate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1hjs79/was_just_invited_to_an_xbox_live_party_where_i/) Anyway...

I don't have a ton of female gamer friends. Males can be so overbearing and competitive. I just want to have fun. My screen name is also my steam id, xbox live, and psn. Feel free to add me with a message that you're from here.

TL;DR:: I'm a transgirl that loves gaming and had an eye opening transition. Add me at Lexi_Like_Crazy on any platform you have. Steam, XBL, or PSN.

I've worked in a gaming store for 4 years, starting as a Christmas temp and working my way up to assistant manager. 

I'm 21 and the only girl where I work. People sometimes have a hard time believing I play games but it usually doesn't extend beyond them being slightly bemused or curious- and they're usually positive when they realise I know my stuff. Because I've worked there for a while most of my customer's are regulars anyway and I've built a good relationship with them over the years.

So today I was busy tidying up the back room for a store visit and I realised that one of the guys on the shopfloor was due to go home. I went to grab him and found him in conversation with a police officer. The guy was clearly bored on patrol (and to be fair, I live in a small town and the street was almost empty today).

They were stood at the till talking about Lord of the Rings- not sure why, but I love Lord of the Rings so I joined in. The staff member went to ask me a question and before I could open my mouth this police officer butts in. ""I don't even know why you're asking her. Girl's don't know anything about films, or games for that matter. In fact (talking to me now) ""You shouldn't even be allowed in here.""

Everyone skipped a beat, my 2 sales guys looked at me as if they were afraid I might spontaneously combust. I waited for him to laugh or any indication that he was being deadpan. Nope. This guy was deadly serious.

I wish I could tell you I nailed him for what he said, but my brain was stuck between wanting to lampoon him, swear and come up with an awesome comeback- none of these options are especially professional but hey ho. Instead I said 'Carry on like that and you'll be out of the shop!' Which is lame, but wouldn't get me arrested.

The police officer must have decided I wasn't there anymore and continued to waffle on about LOTR. So I stomped off (and I was wearing my Doc Marten's which made it satisfyingly stompy). About halfway down the store the police man turns round and goes 'Ooops, did I insult you?' to which I bit out a 'yes'.

Now I've dealt with sexism at work before and ignorance plenty of times, from people saying 'Isn't it funny you work here? I mean you're a girl!' (No?! You don't say!) to 'Surely you don't LIKE games?' to parents trying to hook me up with their SAP offspring ad guys saying 'You have a nice ass. Can I get some discount?' I brush it off, or laugh at them or shoot them down. 

This is different, the guy didn't even think it was anything out of the ordinary to say and didn't seem to think I should feel offended by it. I felt like I'd stepped back in time and gone to work in a different century.

Lucky for me, my sales colleagues are awesome. The minute I left the shop floor they jumped straight to my defense and informed him a) I was the longest serving employee b) I have more systems than anyone else in the store and c) They come to me for advice, especially where it concerns Nintendo ;) so while this is long and ranty (thank you if you stuck with me) ultimately there is hope- because I work with some awesome guys that don't think being a girl prevents me from being passionate about games and are happy to stand up and say that. 

Wow, I feel better for getting it off my chest, thanks guys :)

With that out of the way, I'm going to put this as bluntly as I can: I'm really fucking tired of internet misogyny. I'm happily in a relationship and we both enjoy gaming. However, it makes me incredibly angry that my girlfriend is AFRAID to just be herself on the internet as such sticks mostly to single player games on her PS3. 

Not angry at her - rather, I'm angry at the ignorant grease cloths that have made her afraid to be her gender in any capacity outside her Tumblr and Facebook. She has every right in the world to be her gender anywhere she damn well wants, but she sees all the stories about how horrid and toxic ""gamer culture"" is and she loses interest in the idea entirely. I watch this and I feel helpless and sad that there's nothing I can do, because dudes like that outnumber me ten to one. 

I'll never stop calling dudes like that on their shit. It's tiring though, because I seem to be the only male voice in my present Steam circle that rises against shit like this. I've had the terms ""white knight"" and ""nice guy"" applied to me as a result, and I honestly don't get it. I'm not nice because I want sex or whatever - I'm nice because I LIKE being treated well, and as a result, I treat people how I'd like to be treated. 

Maybe I'm just more naive than I think because I don't understand why that's viewed as a bad thing. Then again, I also don't fucking get why casual misogyny is such the norm when all it does is make you seem like the biggest tool in the universe.

All I really want is my significant other to be free to be herself and get on the other computer and play L4D with me without worrying she's going to be slammed because she doesn't hide her gender. 

As a side note, the hate for misogyny also extends into hate of homophobia and being shitty to the LBGTQ crowd in general. Especially the T, because my best friend in the world is a trans* chick and she deserves the same respect my girlfriend does.

One of the guy's girlfriend heard me talking tonight and started rapid fire questions at me, How old are you? Where do you live? Do you have a boyfriend? Do you play with my boyfriend a lot? Are you guys friends? Why don't you play with other girls? I try my best to answer as quickly as I can while still paying attention in game.

I honestly don't know why I don't play with more girls, I just don't have any girl friends on my LoL friends list. I don't know!

She then said, ""Single and playing video games? Wow...You're a fucking loser. Don't play with or hit on my boyfriend anymore he doesn't need your whore ass, which is why I expect you play video games in the first place, for the attention. Fucking slut.""

I was in disbelief. Like I stopped playing, I just froze. Adam started yelling at his girlfriend and was apologizing profusely to me. The other guys were all upset and everything. It was the most insecure and hateful...thing I've ever been witness to.

I am like, enraged by the entire incident. I can't believe it. Has this ever happened to anyone before? How can someone be so awful? I like to think I have a pretty tough skin to shit talk in games but this was sooo left field. I'm just shaken up. 

Edit #1: Hey guys! Thanks so much for all your responses and stories. I thought I'd update all of you on this drama storm. My friend Adam has left our group for a while to ""sort things out"" with the crazy gf. I talked to him this afternoon and he again said he was sorry and that she's really a nice person and to not take anything she said seriously. Apparently they were fighting earlier that night and she took her frustration out on me and this isn't the first time she's freaked out on one of his girl friends too. I don't really see that as a viable excuse because it was some major BS but whatever. Adams not a stupid guy but I guess he must really love this girl even though she's known to be super jealous and hostile towards other girls. I'm sad that he wont be with us for a while but, I don't know. I wish the best for them. I also love all of you guys :) Each comment raised good points and made me feel better so thank you again! OH I also found a picture of her in case any of you were curious as to what crazy looks like, http://i.imgur.com/FfKlT.jpg  :) jkjk!",,False,self,t5_2rfec,True,,,True,t3_ply83,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/ply83/girlfriend_aggro/,

Different from the last game, girls are now able to wear pants! (it should be stated that in previous games no one was able to change their lower half) There are no gendered clothing items, and boys wearing dresses and pink hair is a totally normal option. After cycling through all available hairstyles for their gender, players can have hairstyles of the opposite gender. There are many strong female characters and some effeminate male characters. Some villagers even express same-sex crushes and it is seen as totally normal! Rad!

Seriously, even if it weren't so amazingly fair and equal, this game is way too fun. Admittedly I spent a good bit of money on a 3DS just so I could get it, but obviously it's well worth it because I'm been playing multiplayer all night since. I just finished my second Public Works Project!

Bioshock Infinite

Heart of the Swarm

The Last of Us

Beyond: Two Souls

Remember Me

Transistor was announced (really hyped for this) &lt;- The art director for this and Bastion is female, also.

and probably more I don't even know about

Anita made her first T vs. WiVG video, Adam Sessler continues to be a strong feminist voice, Cliffy B. came out in support of women in games,  Rhianna Pratchett is getting recognition. And on side note, Ubisoft Toronto, headed by Jade Raymond, is about to release its first game too, Splintcell: Blacklist.

I think this is fucking awesome. The only thing that would make it absolutely perfect for me is if Nintendo drops a kickass-looking new Metroid announcement.

",dr_vonSexmachine,135,19,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/10zcut/its_been_years_since_i_got_a_message_like_this/,"I'm old. Age is accelerated on the internet, so let's just put it this way: I've been using the internet since you had to specify where you wanted to connect *with a telephone number*. I play online multiplayer, but not usually with a mic. I don't mention my gender in games, partially because it doesn't matter and partially because I am a little afraid people will make a big deal and it'll take away from the game. A sad state of affairs, but it is what it is.  

Anyhow, because of those above reasons I've been able to avoid any crap from dudes who feel compelled to let me know just how they feel about sharing server space with someone of the female persuasion. That is of course until a couple of days ago when I received [this](http://imgur.com/Se9wX) message completely out of no where. 

You can read my responses there, and I've blocked out the name because I think an angry mob would only make the person feel justified in their initial comments. I was pretty rude in the beginning as I was angry. I wish I took the higher road from the start.

I think I only responded because I was away in a strange country on business and (as I mention there) had recently given a lot of thought on how my gender effects how I am perceived.

I guess my point is that I don't think females who play games *are* asking for anything special. I mean, I'm even ok with taking precaution to not reveal my gender, although having to even think about that is totally fucked. I hope that in a few years this won't be a problem any more, but I also think that it will take concerted effort to try and counter messages like this. It may fall on deaf ears at first, but maybe one day it will strike a chord and slowly, it will die off. 

Thanks for the space to vent, and I welcome comments sharing your own stories (positive or negative) with regards to gender perception in games. ",,False,self,t5_2rfec,False,,steam,True,t3_10zcut,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/10zcut/its_been_years_since_i_got_a_message_like_this/,

A few weeks ago Sony came through my school toting tents full of Vitas and PS3s for us college kids to play with. I had a few hours between classes, so I settled into the tent that had Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale (which is actually a lot of fun!). I played a few matches before a little girl, about 6 or 7, came wandering up behind me. Sensing her interest, I gave up my controller so that she could play a few matches. When it came time for character selection, I pointed out some of my favorite adorable characters, like Sackboy and Parappa. She turns me down, saying ""I want to play as a girl!"" And so I quickly pointed out Fat Princess, to which she replied ""No, I want to play another girl!"" And that's when it hit me.... there -were- no other girls. Not in this demo, anyway. I know they added Kat and Nariko since then, but I still find that to be a shortage, especially when there are so many great female characters for Sony to work with. It was kind of heart-breaking, telling this little girl who was showing an interest in gaming that there were no other choices for her. But after that speed-bump, she was kicking butt! Got 2nd place a few times against some college kids. And she jumped up and down every time! Gave high-fives to everybody. She was an awesome kid, and I was excited to see her taking an interest.

1360127787.0,107,self.GirlGamers,17zf52,Streaming as a female,jmc500,120,13,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/17zf52/streaming_as_a_female/,"I have started to stream games that I play so viewers can watch my game progress. In addition, I also like to display my webcam of me playing, in the corner of the screen (this is common practice). Though, I realize that doing this, as a female, automatically makes me a target for sexist remarks and sterotypes.



  
I have been gaming my entire life and have been putting up with various comments from the opposite sex. I have no problem dealing with it and ""running with the boys"". But when it comes to streaming, I am somewhat at a loss. Some days I have really nice viewers that enjoy me, for me. Other days, I have cruel viewers, trolling me.



  
These are some of the frequent comments I get:  
• Show me your boobs  
• Girls can't play  
• Go make me a sandwich  
• You look too serious  
• Smile more  



  
Believe it or not, my biggest issue is with the *smile more* and *you look too serious* comments. Those comments don't typically come from a troll. They usually come from the nice viewers that ""concerned"" for me. And in their eyes, something is wrong with me, if I am not smiling or looking happy.



  
If you watch any male streamers, they are (for the most part) concentrating on their game and playing. They aren't ""smiling for the camera"". So, because I am not sitting pretty all the time, it is wrong in the eyes of most men. Can't I just concentrate while I'm playing? Don't get me wrong, I do have fun and laugh and smile with the viewers, but during serious boss fights, I want to focus.



  
This bothers me so much. I feel like there is no way to stop this stereotype. The majority of women are always going to want to look pretty (I know I do). And men are always going to enjoy looking at pretty women and expect it them to be a certain way.

  
Edit: Formatting



Edit #2: First of all, I want to thank you for your support! I feel like I have an understanding with my frustrations. Secondly, I didn't realize how cold, mean and boring I made my stream sound! I really am a happy person. And I do often smile and laugh. It's just the moments when I am truly focusing that I am ""serious"". I do interact with the viewers and actually will take viewers requests (like change a pet that I have in game or change my music). Honestly, I have gotten positive feedback from viewers, saying that I am quite personable and they love how I talk to my viewers. I guess it was just that little thing that has been eating at me. I appreciate all your advice and feedback. :)


For those who asked, here is my [stream](http://www.twitch.tv/Lylac). I like to mostly stream my raids in WoW. I do also stream SC2. And more lately, have been getting into Dota 2. I am not the best, by any means. I just like to have fun.

====================================
====================================
====================================

**Recap**

So if you were not yet aware that /r/girlgamers hit the front page of reddit yesterday, let me catch you up:

Yesterday morning, [pumpkynluvr](http://www.reddit.com/user/pumpkynluvr) (now a veritable karmillionaire), posted a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/10vcm1/thought_you_girls_might_enjoy_this_same_girl_in/) which received quite a lot of [attention.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/10w75y/post_in_rgamergirls_hits_rall_maximum_penis/) It hit /r/all early yesterday morning and /r/girlgamers traffic skyrocketed.

This is not the first time /r/girlgamers has gotten a lot of external attention, not even in [recent memory.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1032nn/my_official_cosplay_of_cortana_from_halo_4/) But it is the first time such a large external discussion took place in one of our threads, and as a side-effect, the post's karma rating has blown a couple [records.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all)

====================================

**Purpose**

Everything considered, I thought it would be a good idea to do a bit of a post-mortem and talk about what went really well and what didn't and what we can do to improve (and open up a discussion on these things), as this kind of attention is becoming more common, so we can evolve to be more prepared for the next time it happens. 

This event blew our previous unique viewer count [out of the water](http://i.imgur.com/IwqIo.png), which itself had shattered previous records. There were a number of unsavory posts submitted to the thread, and thanks to many of you, the reports of these posts were quite thorough, and in some cases, we mods were able to remove some of them before many users had to read them.

====================================

**Principles**

To recap some of our basic principles, /r/girlgamers is open to ALL people interested in gaming, and we encourage discussion (even if it's unpopular), but there is absolutely no trolling, white-knightery or hate speech allowed and we frown very strongly on inflammatory language. In short, you're welcome to make a dissenting opinion, but you need to be prepared for the fact that some people will downvote you for it, and if you use inflammatory language to make that opinion, your post may be removed by the mods. If it is particularly egregious, you may be banned without warning.

====================================

**Results**

Following these principles, the moderators took approximately 120 actions, including distinguished comments, comment removals/approvals and bans - on this one thread alone. In fact, [this](http://i.imgur.com/abNDB.png) is what the bottom of that thread looks like on my screen (usernames removed from screenshot).

So here are the things I think went well:

1. Users reported offensive comments very quickly.
2. Moderators were able to respond fairly quickly.
3. Our regular subscribers were very helpful in maintaining a healthy discussion, even in more offensive parts of the thread.
4. We got a lot of attention and gained a lot of fans (subscriber counts will be out in traffic stats tomorrow, but I'm fairly certain we increased our subscriber count by about 3.5%, which is a huge increase.

Things that didn't go so well:

1. We had no way of notifying regular users that the thread was on the front page (so discussion was starkly different from usual).
2. There was a lot of downvote brigading - in some cases it was warranted (trolls/bigotry/misogyny), but in a few cases, some very valid (but dissenting) opinions were downvoted a bit unfairly.

====================================

**Ideas for Improvement**

* One user [suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/10vcm1/thought_you_girls_might_enjoy_this_same_girl_in/c6ha9rr) we devise a method (probably through CSS) of notifying our users if a page is receiving external attention which could potentially change the tone of the discussion compared to what we're used to in our relatively bedroom community. The mods will be working on that for the future.

* Occasionally, a comment was reported by users that I or another mod felt was salient to discussion (despite being mildly inflammatory or stating an unpopular/dissenting opinion), and we Approved the comment (clearing the report). Then later, another report would be made about that comment. Unfortunately, that is just part of the way reddit's moderation system works, but maybe we could consider making a flair class of some sort that shows the moderators have reviewed a user's comment and approved it. I'm not sure if this is possible on a per-post basis, but I think it'd be useful in large discussions. 

* We need to remind everyone that [reddiquette](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette) is paramount to healthy discussion. Just because you disagree with someone doesn't mean you should downvote them. If someone says something offensive that actively disrupts the discussion, go ahead and downvote that, but if someone is merely making an opposing statement to the majority, they shouldn't be punished for speaking up.

====================================

**Conclusion**

We had a busy day yesterday, but other days will come. After an event like this, I think we need to come together and figure out ways to make the next time a bit smoother, because this is going to get more and more common. If you have any ideas or any questions/disagreements for what I've said here, please share them below. 

====================================
====================================

**tl;dr**

/r/girlgamers rocks, you guys rock, I love you all. Let's make sure everyone that visits our community feels that love. It's what makes us different and great.

**Edit** The article is yet another in a long line of lazy ""Oh look women apparently play games now.""  What I found disturbing enough to post here was one of the few posted comments.  Perhaps I'm not jaded enough not to be floored that people think this way enough to consider it fact.  

It also has an incredibly delusional reader comment:

&gt; The 'hardcore' gamers are still men, and will always be men. Competition is a testosterone derived trait, and men have more testosterone. The fashion and cosmetic industries cater heavily towards women (the male market is growing), men aren't complaining. The only reason that this is even a story is because the vocal minority have twisted this into a sexism issue (when in fact as the article correctly says that the % of female gamers is increasing).
The sexes are better at different things, Serena Williams even admitted that she (or any female tennis player) would stand no chance against their male counterparts. It's pure biology.
Equality is wrong; we should be encouraging everyone to do what they're best at. The outcome for an equal society is: no innovation, no geniuses, no sports stars, no future.
Need I remind you that almost the entirety of all inventions/discoveries were made by men? And just to throw this out there: White Men.

I tried checking out the other gaming subreddits, but they were too niche. [/r/truegaming](/r/truegaming) was only discussion, and [/r/Games](/r/Games) was just more discussion news, and reviews. 

I tried reaching out to the moderators about the need to change. But had been dismissed by my suggestions of simple rules like putting the title of the game in the post. May members of [/r/gaming](/r/gaming) were in similar distress but again moderators failed to apply these changes desperately needed to make a better quality page. 

I decided I had enough and if I and others could not change [/r/gaming](/r/gaming), we would create our own version; [/r/Gaming4Gamers](/r/Gaming4Gamers). With Improved moderation, a positive atmosphere and a more mature like minded audience. When I attempted to promote my subreddit to [/r/gaming](/r/gaming), it was quickly filtered from the search bar. 

I have resorted to promoting [/r/Gaming4Gamers](/r/Gaming4Gamers) to as many gaming subreddits (with permission from your moderators). We are especially Interested in reaching the subscribers of [/r/GirlGamers](/r/GirlGamers) as one of our rules we Wish to enforce is to provide an atmosphere of equality. To have people understand Gamer Girls are not girls that game, but are just gamers plain and simple. This understanding of equality does not just apply to gender, but race and orientation as well. As such we hope you take a look at our subreddit and continue to pursue what we all love. 

Long live play.

Edit: I am overwhelmed by everyone's support here. Our number of subscribers has **TRIPPLED** and [/r/girlgamers](/r/girlgamers) moderator lingrush as well as several others have joined in a helping in moderating the new subreddit.

Humans versus Zombies (HvZ) is a usually week long game played on college campuses that is basically a really complicated and involved game of tag. At my university we had missions, NPCs, and a full-fledged story so it was most similar to LARP. I took part every year I could but my last game I had a really negative experience with some guys who took the game too far.
	
To try and skip as much unnecessary detail as possible the game had recruited a lot of new players who didn’t all know the rules particularly well and some who just wanted to see how far they could stretch them. My friends and I (all zombies) were staking out a particular group of humans who had broken the rules a few times before now. To keep things simple, while we were watching one of them clearly broke the rules. I decided to stay out of this dispute and let a friend who was with us report the blatant cheating.
	
Here’s where things get stupid. The guy we’d seen cheat went into our student union and began bragging in a public place about his cheating. So he got caught (obviously) and with accounts given by some friends and myself waskicked from the game. So then he went back to where he got overheard and began cussing the game, the mods… and then me. I’d like to mention I’d spoken maybe one sentence to this guy. But somewhere along the way he decided I was the one who turned him in and honed in on me. For the record, I was the only female in the group that was after him (which I do think played into this). So he and one of his friends started talking; about knowing I lived in his dorm, knowing my work schedule on campus, when I’d be alone at night and how they could make “accidents” happen to me. A person I trusted well was in the room and heard all this and told me the phrase “beat the shit out of” was used.

Obviously my group took action. We went to campus police, reported the incident and they in turn went to speak to the guy who made the threats. After ignoring campus police knocking as his door (how dumb can you be?) they finally caught up with him and he said it was “all a joke”. Sound familiar? The reason I chose girlgamers to post this is because I feel like this is what I hear a lot of ladies go through when playing online. Guys targeting female players make “jokes” and don’t expect to be taken seriously. I don’t have an xbox so I’ve been safe from the xbox community but I’ve played MMOs years so while this isn’t new to me it was really jarring to have it happen with someone who *could* actually make good on their claim. What scares me most is for the future. I graduated last semester and there are many other ladies in the group who I worry about being put in this sort of situation. Obviously the jerk from this encounter won’t be welcomed back but what if it happens to someone else who isn’t well known or doesn’t reach the heads of the group? It sucks that I have to worry for my friends playing a simple game. I do genuinely feel like I was targeted in this case because of my sex. The group I was with that saw the guy cheat was all male except for me and there were a solid 4 other people in it but I was the one that got threatened. A few of my friends said they thought it might have been because I’m very good at the game and the guy felt threatened by a girl doing so well but that seems beyond silly.

**TLDR; Due to a glorified game of tag I was threatened to “have the shit beaten out of” me**

Of course the thread got derailed with both drug references (idk why) and, it so happens, sexism (not directed at anyone, but in general, like ""I'm a woman, I'm allowed to be illogical"" and ""I'm a man, so I'm allowed to believe that thread derailment will only increase when spankings from [username of girl in previous post] are the punishment"" and ""Indeed"" in response).

I mentioned that stuff is exactly what we're talking about, that even if it's joking it's still perpetuating the sexism we mentioned before. Generally, seriously, I don't care, but since it was a thread dedicated to what we find offensive or controversial, I brought it up. I then got this message from the clan administrators:

&gt;Hey [illgresi],
I just wanted to say this in a private forum, there is a lot of joking around in this clan, and yah, a lot of sexism and sexual jokes, etc... I occasionally partake in such, but not often. Just in case I hit a nerve in the future, I wanted to preface that with this:

Teaching abroad, working at NBC news... and gosh darnit you are only 22 years old, literally just a couple months older than myself. I just wanted to say that in the wake of the sexism, I really do think you seem like an amazing person, and feel humbled by your accomplishments this early in life :)
Just so you don't think that your awesomeness is overlooked because of your gender.

First, I apologize in advance, because I'm brand new to this whole reddit thing.

I'm an undergraduate currently working through my last semester for my Bachelor's Degree in Women's Studies.  In order to graduate, I have to perform an ""independent study"" where I study a topic of my choice in depth.  It so happens that my interests include the intersection of gender and technology; thus, the gendered nature of interactions between ""gamers"" is the focus of this study.

I'm here because it would be a tremendous help if I could get some women who consider themselves ""gamers"" to answer my survey (yes, I am looking for only female respondents at this time).  For science!  So far, I have had a few volunteers respond through other resources than reddit, but not nearly enough to draw well-founded conclusions on my area of study.  To make it more ""responder-friendly"" I've simplified the survey as much as I felt I could while maintaining the level of detail and scope that I want the study to entail.

Now I have only been playing WoW for roughly a month and just recently hit 85 and still in the process of improving my gear. Well last night, we had one bad pull that resulted in a wipe and this other DPS starts going off on the group for sucking. Then started targeting me for being 'low dps' and 'shit gear'. My boyfriend then pointed out to the guy that I was doing more damage then he was with my 'shit' gear. 

The guy then started saying ""Oh she's your girlfriend, you're just being a good person and telling her she's doing awesome when she really sucks."" At this point, I decided to step in since I'm not a huge fan of people fighting my battles for me. I then linked the DPS meter which showed how much damage I did compared to the guy. He then pulls the ""I'm not even trying!"" 

Really? Not even trying? In a Heroic? Then why bother queuing up for a dungeon if you're not going to try and half ass it? I really don't get people at all.

Many redditors on /r/girlgamers are seeking female companionship rather than debate and activism.  This space is to provide a place for female gamers to meet in a harassment-free and friendly environment.  It is more heavily moderated against hostility, harassment, and bigotry. This is a female-only space (transwomen included) and we will check to make sure everybody's facebook profile is legitimate to minimize trolling.

Here is the temporary description for the facebook group: 

This is a safe space for lady gamers to discuss and meet up to game! We'll also be using this group to organize IRL MEETUPS OOOOH.

This facebook group is not for critical debate; it is for enjoying female camaraderie, making friends, relating, and well, meeting up to game!

This group will be more heavily moderated than the subreddit. Harassment and bigotry will not be accepted. This is a female-only gaming space and we will only accept women (transwomen included) with legitimate facebook pages (or who have another way of demonstrating they are not trolling with a fake facebook account).

I work for a company called Lady Geek and we've been working hard to get to the point where we have a published book called ""Little Miss Geek"", which was the kick starter of the Campaign to go to schools and do coding clubs using Raspberry Pi as well as Gaming clubs, including making mods for Minecraft. There's also planned to work on mum-returners programme to help women who left the industry to have families and want to come back. 

We already have some big clients supporting us and we're doing great progress.


The whole thing started with the fact that there are only 17% female workforce in the Tech industry in the UK and it's decreasing by 0.5% every year. And that's not good. 



What you can do to support this campaign is (apart from buying the book, available on amazon.co.uk, eBook as well) write a blog post on our collaborative wordpress blog : http://littlemissgeek.org/



**Anyone can write something for us - be it your experience in gaming as a girl and how you would like that to change and in what way or if you work in IT/Games how did you decide to do that, what is your story. Anything you want that's related to the cause. Just send me an email at rossi@ladygeek.com and I will give you an invite to the blog.**
 

The idea is to grow this blog with many different opinions, views and stories and take it to our clients, which you can see on our website www.ladygeek.com and show them what the women, who aren't afraid to call themselves 'geek' have to say. We can make a HUGE difference - together. Thank you!



**tl;dr:** You can help to show young girls that tech and games aren't boys only and stupid. Write a blog post with your opinions and story.

Now, could this be because I've never had a true female friend in real life? The only one I ever had turned out to be your stereotypical drama-queen.. So I said screw that. 

But now, I have my group of guy friends online, and whenever another female enters that group, I instantly go on edge. I go into guard-dog mode. It's a horrible character flaw, I know, and I want to change.

Some friends recently started playing the Beta of a Diablo II-style game called Path of Exile. They had a lot of wonderful things to say about it and I decided to give it a shot since the Beta is free to play.

As soon as I fired up the game, I noticed this: http://i.imgur.com/Jc3GS1J.jpg

This made me feel a bit sad because, well, a sexy slavegirl had essentially been pinupped into a critical part of the UI that I'd be looking at constantly. It was like I'd fired up the game and the first thing the game had said to me was ""Yo, boys!"" Not necessarily a ""No girls allowed"" sign or anything, but... ya know. I kind of felt bad about casting spells, like I was making her be there or something.

So anyway, I made a post on their user interface forums requesting plain mana bubbles - or even just the OPTION for plain mana bubbles, and the reaction to said post has been... poor.  Responses have ranged from ""There's not a problem"" to ""You're stupid and whiny and hypocritical and there's not a problem.""

Maybe it was just the way I asked? Or maybe their forum community sucks? Or maybe I shouldn't have said anything?

1367190253.0,77,self.GirlGamers,1dasx8,The requested results from my survey about sexism in gaming,AtomicPanda82,94,17,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1dasx8/the_requested_results_from_my_survey_about_sexism/,"A short while ago, I posted a link to a survey I created about sexism in gaming. Many of you requested that I post results when I was finished with it, so here they are! **Please note: I could only view 100 responses without paying over $200 for the year. So that is what I've taken my responses from, and I regret that I didn't get to read all of them.**

**EDIT:** Some of you requested quotes from the responses I collected. Reddit wouldn't let me add them to the post, as it made the post too long, but I have posted them up in a comment which you can see [right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1dasx8/the_requested_results_from_my_survey_about_sexism/c9r5p3m). They may make you angry and disgusted and sad, but in my opinion, they're worth a read.

Without any further delay, here's the results, question by question. The most popular responses for singular-choice questions will be bolded.

**1. How old are you?**

So, there you guys have it. There's all my results, laid out in an (hopefully) easy way to read. I'm not great with formatting on Reddit, so I did the best I could. It took me quite awhile to sort through all the answers and categorize them, or I would have had them up sooner. Sorry about that! However, I think it's pretty interesting to see all this data. Thank you guys for being super awesome and providing me with some pretty great, well thought-out responses that I can use in my paper!

If you guys are interested in the quotes that I'm going to be incorporating into my paper, I will gladly edit the post and add them in. Also, if anyone is interested in the actual paper, I can post it up somewhere and link it once I'm completely finished with it (it's due May 6th, so it shouldn't be too much longer!). Just let me know :) Thanks again, everyone.

On my super awesome *new* phone sex account to separate this shit from my real life, but you'll understand in a second why. 

So - I'm sick of just reporting assholes, or just ignoring assholes in the gameosphere. I want you to have something that slices back just as hard when they say something awful to you. 

Believe me, if you're the type of person who doesn't want to ""**sink down to their level**"" - I completely COMPLETELY understand. I'm just making this thread in case their are people who are okay with doing that. If one insult can *hopefully* make a guy think, ""oh man, so that's what it feels like"" that'd be cool. Their standard fallback argument is ""well this is just how we talk during games, get used to it."" 

Okay then, here's us getting used to it, but guys-who-ask-us-to-get-used-to-it, be warned when we come back at you. 

I'm here to help come up with come backs to the insults. While I could just provide a list of insults and come backs, I feel like that might get stagnant. 

**What I want is for you to comment with some of the worst insults you've gotten during a gaming session (or more than one) - and I'll give you some witty (slash disturbing) comebacks.**

My koala-fications? Well, it's not just phone sex I do, but fetish phone sex. I literally get paid to find twisted ways to insult guys. Stuff from...

&gt;You're a pathetic piece of shit who doesn't deserve love and will never be loved

All the way to 

&gt;I am literally ripping your asshole open with my fist and a huge dildo, and you fucking are asking for more, aren't you?

(...and I get **paid** for this. Weird world.) 

I figure for the every day guy who's on various devices insulting chicks, he has no clue these types of things even exist (or turn some dudes on. o_O) 

PS: I might be referencing really really big dildos up anuses a lot. This is in no way a derogatory statement towards the gay community, or straight blokes who like dildos up their arses. 

It's more of a way to even the playing field with these guys who threaten rape, and I'm 99.9% certain (well, assumingly certain) that most gay guys aren't out there threatening to rape girls over X-Box/etc. I leave the .01% cause there's always that weird off chance... o_O 

**Edit:** Cause I like what /u/Alushia said, for those of you who want to appear way more awesome to 3rd parties, I will include both: 

**Provide one really disturbing disgusting comment** and
**Provide /hopefully/ a witty awesome comment too**

I say hopefully because humor is subjective sometimes. :-P 

**Double edit:** Wow! While I didn't get like, any former-guy-insults, the responses to this thread were AMAZING and I'm so psyched to have chatted with y'all!

This danger seems to be more applicable to women than men and I would like to warn/share with you ladies a personal experience of mine on the topic.

It is really easy to make wonderful friends online who you may consider people whom you can trust. It is only natural that you would want to meet them in real life after playing countless hours of games online together, but please remember that they might not always be what they seem.

I once met up with a friend from my clan for the first time. We knew each other online for over a year. We were just friends and I never spoke to him sexually. I considered him a good friend and I trusted him. My friend came to visit and he needed a place to stay for the night because he lived far away. I offered to let him stay at my house. He tried to take advantage of me sexually and when I said ""no"" he got extremely upset and violent. It was one of the scariest experiences of my life, as I live alone and did not expect him to be like this in real life. 

Moral of the story: don't be stupid like I was. Do not put yourself in a dangerous position. When meeting with online friends, bring someone with you and (as many ladies have mentioned in comments) meet up in a public area such as a mall. Don't think that you are immune to rape or other forms of sexual harassment from men just because you are friends with them online.

If anyone else has similar experiences or other opinions on the topic I'd love to read.



********
[EDIT] I am glad to have read that many of you had positive experiences meeting online friends IRL for the first time. I too have met many wonderful people from the internet in person. However, the point of this topic isn't to say that all people from the internet are bad and scary sexual predators. The point is that you should never let your guard down just because you've had positive experiences in the past.

But the author makes an interesting point that I haven't heard elsewhere:

&gt;But what’s particularly alarming here is the point nobody seems to be making.

&gt;The question of whether or not Lara Croft is “explicitly” raped seems incidental considering the fact that, as a form of virtual reality or digital artwork (take your pick), any form of sexual violence in Tomb Raider necessarily functions on an abstract, rhetorical level.

&gt;In the original “Crossroads” trailer that sparked this controversy, Lara Croft only becomes legitimately empowered against her aggressors when she picks up a gun and begins brutalizing them herself—just like the bride in “Kill Bill,” Lisbeth Salander in “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,” and any number of other female protagonists granted the use of force only after it’s forced upon them by their male aggressors.

&gt;Sexual attacks require more of a response in their depiction than just more violence. Will videogames ever be able to crawl out of their footing in the “rape and revenge” tradition?

I just wanted to share what happened to me yesterday. It's the first time I've had any negative experience regarding my gender in WoW in a LONG time.

I was running a heroic with my husband with 3 random players from separate realms. It was going just fine everyone seemed to know what they were doing and it was really smooth. We killed a boss and a piece of tanking gear dropped. My husband is a ret pally with a tanking off spec. He checked the current tanks gear and saw that he had a piece similar and of the same item level so he thought it was safe to roll. My husband won the gear and the tank flipped out. He said it was better for him than his current piece and my husband said no problem didn't think you needed it and tried to trade it to him.

Then all three of them started calling him a ninja and saying he was pathetic and worthless and a neck beard and a bunch of hateful stuff. I told them to calm down it was a mistake and he was trying to trade it back and the tank said fuck off and left the group. I was super baffled. We got a new tank and got to the next boss. Then randomly one of them says LOL she must be the ret pallies girl friend. I said I was his wife and all three of them(including the new tank) all started saying horrible things to me. I got called a cunt too many times to count. I was told I was fat and pimply and would never equate to being a true human being. I got told my vagina was fishy as shit and that it has to be covered in yeast because of how pathetic I was. I got called flabby pussy flaps which was the weirdest thing I've ever been called. And then I remembered there was an IGNORE option I've never even had to use it before in my 5 years of playing WoW! We both reported them all for language and opened a ticket. I know I'll never see them again since they're on ignore and on separate servers.

I was just pretty much in shock from this. Most of the time there is literally no special response when people find out I'm a female.

This can be from the most casual interest to the most serious professional gaming.”


This is the web-definition laid out by wikipedia.


No where does it say that you need to be good at it, with perfect scores and fastest times. 


No where does it state that you are model.


No where in the definition is there a buxom babe chewing on a controller or covering her breasts or other bits with various gaming instruments 24/7.


I do not see the word ""kitchen"" ANY where in there..


There is nothing stating that you have to be nice and sweet in game OR in real life. 


It does not require an apology for your game of choice. 


It doesn't state a race, nor a creed. 


You simply require a passion. 


A love for the game. 


Just a friendly reminder from your neighborhood game-dame!

I'm an Xbox LIVE support agent, and you called me on Friday to ask about a shitty connection. I think your gamertag was Karens Khaos or something like that. You said you had a connection problem and had gotten kicked off of LIVE. You said, ""I got disconnected when I was playing Battl--I mean, when I was using Xbox LIVE.""

And it made me sad, because I realized that you didn't want to say you were playing Battlefield. Was it because you were afraid I'd hit on you? Or you didn't want to get talked down to about how it was a man's game? Whatever your reason, and I'm sure it was a good one, it hurt to hear you sound like you were embarrassed--afraid?--to admit you play competitive shooters. 

I asked you if you were looking forward to Battlefield 3, and I could hear your eyes light up and the enthusiasm pour out of you. I'm glad I could talk gamer to gamer with you for a few minutes while we waited for the computer to work. I don't want to lecture you, or tell you you have a responsibility to fight whatever bullshit made you try to bite back your words. I just want to say I'm sorry, for whatever it is, and I hope that someday, you won't have to watch what you say when you talk about the hobby you love.

1355928411.0,67,self.GirlGamers,153z0f,My worst gaming experiences on XBL have always been instigated by other ladies.,AllyYours,87,20,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/153z0f/my_worst_gaming_experiences_on_xbl_have_always/,"I am one of the girls who grew up gaming because I idolized my older brother and he played. In order to spend time with him, I played the games he did. And my brother is very competitive and brutally honest, so there was no complimenting me for just completing a game if he stomped me, and there was certainly no letting me win. Consequently, I am very talented at the gametypes I play, and I have a very thick skin when it comes to my ability. 

I don't really remember being tested about my gaming prowess, but I am sure it has happened. But I really have been gaming forever, so I don't think I've ever had trouble passing one of these tests, so that could be why the occurrences don't stand out. I am also pretty good at dishing it out as good as I get it. I know lots of you don't support talking shit back to the guys, but there is almost something therapeutic about letting out some of my frustration and stress on douchey guys who try to talk shit to me first. (I am never initially antagonistic; it happens after I get a message like ""Ally is an ugly cunt"" or some guy says ""hurr hurr I bet she's playing on her period"").

And yet, I would say, in general, 90% of guys online are indifferent toward my presence or are nice, polite, funny guys. My experiences with females have been completely different. I'd say 50% of girls act like dicks toward me before even getting to know who I am. I've had other girls say ""Well, if she can beat you guys, you know she's a fat no-life"" after I've topped the leaderboad. I've had guys ask for me to send pictures, and upon declining, had a girl in their party say ""only ugly girls don't send out pictures hahahahaha."" But these experiences are not the ones for which I am writing this post.

On three occasions, I have made friends playing CoD, not realizing I had done anything wrong, only to have a shitstorm occur. Each of these times, the offending girl was the ""main girl"" of the friend group that I stumbled upon, something I didn't realize. I love playing with other girls, and two of my best friends on the game are girls. I'm always looking to make more female friends, so I am always friendly toward girls and try (maybe too hard) to be chummy with them. So the guys would invite me to fill up their party if they had a spot. Several times, I would join the party just to see another person instantly leave, the guys sigh, and invite someone else. I asked what had happened and they would say, ""Oh that's Jackie, she doesn't like playing with other girls, but we thought we'd try anyway."" This leaves me dumbfounded every time. I'm sitting here thinking, ""They play with another girl?! Awesome, I hope she is really good and she likes me so that we can smack these kids together and I'll have a friend in the lobby when the inevitable slew of 'fat, ugly, sluts, etc' comes our way."" And so it hurt a bit to realize that these girls must have been thinking bad things about me. I'd always reply to these guys, ""Man, that sucks. I'm really cool and I'm nice I promise!"" 

Now I don't know why, or if it even really occurred, but these girls decided THEIR guys were enjoying my company too much and I was taking over their ""turf."" And they went crazy. They got on my FB friends list and started messaging my friends asking for pictures of me. They started joining my games and saying I was a slut. They started messaging the rest of my XBL friend list asking if I had ever sent sexual messages to the guys (and one girl who has a guy avatar) on there and/or telling them I was sending dirty messages to their bf. (I wasn't.) They sent messages to the guys in their friend group telling them I was fat, saying that I slept around, etc. One girl sent me a message telling me I ruined her life. I asked who she was (I really didn't know) and if I could fix whatever I'd done. She started posting pictures of me on her FB with mean captions. CRAZY shit that just doesn't even compare remotely with the harassment I've experienced from guys on the game. ""Tits or GTFO"" messages seem like nothing in comparison. I'd gladly delete 50 ""I bet you're fat"" messages every DAY than experience one of these ""girl assaults"" again. 

This is definitely not every girl, as I said 50% seem nice or at least indifferent toward me. But the other 50% are not friendly and some are just insane in their disdain for other women. Are we ladies putting up more barriers keeping girls out of our club? How do you deal with something like that?

TL;DR - Guys can be dicks online, but seem like puppies compared to the extremes that girls have gone to against me.

I am working on a photo project for school highlighting the diversity of gamers around the world and I need your help!

The idea is to get as many people as possible to take pictures of themselves, their friends, family, neighbours, pets, etc. in their gaming environments (at home, on the bus, arcade, LAN parties, etc ) to present in a final collage.

Basically, the whole point is to show that all sorts of people game, and we don't all necessarily look like [this](http://thegamefanatics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/SP.jpg) 

Feel free to post pics to imgur. The images will be presented in my Games Studies class and posted online. I am going to be cropping the photos to a 1x1 ratio (square) so if you could frame your photos within a square that'd be awesome :)

The more the merrier! I appreciate any and all help! Cheers!

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who participated! Based on the responses I got, my thesis changed a bit.

At one point he asked ""Can I call you woman?"" to which I responded ""Only if I can call you asshole"". I thought it was going to turn into that whole ordeal we all know.

Last night, the leader of the team we were supposed to scrim just wasn't online. He didn't say anything to our leader about not being there. He just never came online. All 9 of us were in mumble, waiting and waiting, only to get nothing out of it. I know it's hard to realize that online time is still someone's actual time, but goddamn. There were 9 real people waiting on his stupid ass, and he didn't have the courtesy to even say anything. 

The night before last, a different team asked us to scrim but said they only had 30 minutes, which was enough for the map they wanted to do. 20 minutes after we were supposed to start, they still didn't have everyone, so my team had spent 20 minutes wandering around their fucked up server for no reason. 

I get that it's hard to put real faces to the online characters, but Jesus Christ. It's not THAT hard.

My Reddit keyword filters were probably blocking some, since that's only 22. EDIT: Turns out my Reddit was set to hide links with a rating below 0.

So it does look like there's more ""girly"" topics that the user was not interested in. It includes girl power, sexualization, etc. Almost none of them are bad, and some are probably repeating discussions that've already been had, but I don't know where else those topics belong.

Time for more stats.

So… does this mean the empowering stuff gets lots of upvotes because it makes everyone feel good? There's very few topics that are *only* about gaming, but maybe even /r/girlgamer subscribers go to /r/truegaming or /r/games to discuss it over there. I'm subscribed to both and I read through the comments and usually feel like I don't have to bring it up elsewhere.

Okay, this is where it got *really* interesting for me. If you're still reading you might find it interesting too. Otherwise you've downvoted me or I'm gonna read your brutal comment very soon.

The top 7 links of all time are under my ""girly"" category, it's not until #8 where we get 3 ""gaming"" links in a row, and they are 8, 7 and 10 months old in that order. I don't know how many subscribers there were then, but links 2 to 7 are more recent. Only #1 is 7 months old, and it's got over 2000 more upvotes.

Everything else up to #25 were also posted less than 7 months ago. (16, 21 and 22 being the only young ""gaming"" links.)

I only discovered this subreddit a week or two ago, and as with all subreddits I check the top scoring links of all time first. When I went through these, I thought they were hilarious and cool. I started posting, and I knew I loved this place for sure.

I'd like a history lesson on this place now, because I wasn't here 7 months ago, and I don't know who else wasn't here or what the community was like. Based on the top 25 scoring links, people are more interested in ""girly"" topics now than they were 7 months ago when it ~~was~~ appears to be more about ""gaming"" but not in the same way other gaming subreddits are like.

Closing this off with something cool and making you feel like you learned something would be great, but I don't know how to do that.

For a long time, they didn't know I was a woman until I inevitably started speaking. 

One guy made a huge deal out of it. He started listing all these old, cliche /v/ board circlejerk jokes (PS3 has no games, etc.) to try and test my 'gamer cred'. He also asked ""so, are you so-and-so's internet gf?"". I thought ""welp, it was a good run."" but to my surprise, the other 8 or so guys on the server humiliated him for his actions. But, they weren't whiteknighting it.

For years I've put up with men becoming either sexual or overly protective by finding out I'm actually a woman. Yet, for the first time I've found a group that honestly doesn't care and doesn't treat me any differently (not even positive sexism or treating me with ""kids gloves"").

You’re my favourite subreddit (and you, GirlGamers are also AWESOME!!!!), and some of you may remember me from some long, navel-gazing comments about mythology, academia, equality and Buddhist meditation.  Or maybe because I preface almost every comment with ‘mate’.  I’m not nearly as obnoxiously Australian in real life, it’s an internet affectation.

Five months ago, back in August, I responded to a very curious post on our sub:

http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/x46ob/looking_to_recruit_a_female_cis_or_mtf_nonvideo/

It was a curious request for a person – specifically a female person – with no professional videogame experience to hop on board a project to design a videogame.  But not just any videogame.  A game who had multiple female main characters, one of whom was transgender, one of whom was a warrior, none of whom were stereotypes.  Being an avid gamer, as many of us are, I was interested and asked the OP to send me a message with more details about the project.  They sent me some additional information, and asked to have a short GChat interview to see if I was serious about the project and what they were looking for.

I agreed – my reasoning was, if they were random internet weirdos (!), all they had was my reddit handle and I could easily deal with internet strangers.  As it turned out, they weren’t weirdos, wanted me on the project, and were very serious about their philosophy: to involve more people – amateur gamers, artists, etc. – and particularly women in game-making, opening up a somewhat restricted medium to new ideas, diverse perspectives, and, most importantly, MORE GAMES!

Six months ago, I had no experience making computer games.  Tomorrow, we release the first level of a game that I helped create.  It’s bare bones, and we’re releasing it for free, but I feel proud to be involved in making even this small thing in an area I knew nothing about.  And, honestly, it’s all thanks to you, TwoX.  

If you have two minutes of your day, this is what the creative efforts of my last six months have produced:

Newgrounds:http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/608637

Kongregate: http://www.kongregate.com/games/Eth3rn1an/crecia-the-splitting-e1-level-1


It’s only the first level and I look forward to taking feedback as we continue to develop and improve upon it for the new levels.

The world of games needs you! We all talk a good talk on our sub about cutting down objectification in videogames, or having three-dimensional female characters in all forms of media, and projects like mine are one way to put this in action.  So, they are looking for more applicants to take on.  The entire project is outlined here: http://www.eth3rn1a.com/  And it’s open application – they want someone different to develop an episode with their help.  Come join us!

I'm here for a few hours, and one of my collaborators (and my boss!) /u/catsrpeople4 , will be happy to answer any questions you have!

Don’t dream it, be it.

With a Girl Made Me Uncomfortable, Any Advice/Opinions on Girl Gamers Who Try to Abuse Their Female Status?",Milotica,81,18,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/yd61k/gaming_exp_with_a_girl_made_me_uncomfortable_any/,"[Forgive me if I'm posting this in the wrong place, I'm brand new to this subreddit, but my question does pertain to female gamers.]

Tonight I had a rather upsetting experience with a fellow female gamer on Xbox Live, when she joined a public game my boyfriend and I were playing in.

The girl joined in, had a mic, and was cooperating with my boyfriend and I. She even spoke of a group of female gamers she often plays with, and offered to have me join them. She continuously dropped hints that she was a member of this very subreddit. I'm not the type to feel threatened by another woman's presence when it comes to public games, and so the first round playing with her was a pleasure, and I had every intention of sending her a friend request later on.

It was after this, when a friend of hers joined and took another spot on our team, that I began to feel very uncomfortable. She began flirting openly with my boyfriend, asking him about his interests and personal life (he claimed it wasn't so obvious), but not acknowledging my presence in the game at all. On more than one occasion she refrained from helping me out (despite me asking her to) and let me die, all because she was preoccupied with my boyfriend.

Later, an Xbox friend of mine joined our party, and she began openly flirting with him as well. She began talking about her ladybits, mainly using them as exclamations which she uttered on several occasions. Being the shy girl that I am, I became very insecure about this and retreated from the conversation.

She bragged about her  gaming accomplishments to my boyfriend (granted, she WAS pulling her weight, but was not topping score charts by any means). He was impressed by her claims, as was I. She then admitted to us that she was well under 18 years old, which was fine, a few of us are underage, including myself (but not my SO, who's in his 20's). She kept joking cutesy-like about how young and helpless she was to be playing with older men (I'm not convinced she was that young, she sounded like an adult to us).

At this point I was barely even talking. It was obvious that I was feeling insecure and shy about the topics of her conversation, my boyfriend caught on and tried to steer the conversation away from her, but she refused to let him. She began joking about how she had a song stuck in her head, and then started singing it to the boys of our party, giggling the whole time (it turned out to be a horrible sexual rap song in which the two biggest contributing words were ""tits"" and ""pussy"").

We later did a little investigating in her achievements list, and it appeared she had stretched the truth about all those accomplishments, and was not even particularly established in that game or any other ones.

It upsets me to know that there are women out there whose main goal is to draw attention from men, and resort to videogame lobbies for this. I know this subreddit is touchy about referring to female gamers are ""attention grabbers"", but tonight I was completely blown away by how low and embarrassed this woman made me feel. I would have left the game, but I didn't want to give in and quit out, as I was the host.

TL;DR - Xbox girl wouldn't stop flirting with my boyfriend and friend, was treating me badly during the game, and kept talking about her fembits and trying to command attention. Ruined my in-game experience and made me feel like crap.

My questions are: how prominent are girls like this in the community (I'm not new to videogames, I just usually play with men)? Do you have any similar stories to share? What would you do in a similar situation? If any men are reading this, how does playing with women like this make you feel?

As female gamers in this subreddit wishing to promote our image as equals, I believe that it's this kind of behavior that really sets us back.

",bananapancakez,76,15,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/yeaw0/anyone_else_get_aggravated_when_despite_all_the/,"I was browsing Reddit, and this post came up: [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ydifv/video_game_companies_are_your_friends/)

I enjoyed the comic and I got the jokes, but it was very disappointing that they could not have had even one woman portraying a gaming company.  I've played games for most of my life, from almost all of these companies at different points, and I'm already sad that women have to defend their abilities/desire to play games, and that we aren't always considered a marketable audience to make games for (though I'm glad that there are discussions about ""booth babes"" and about ""combat skip"" options because at least if there is talk, there might be progress.) In fact, this is the reason I subscribe to /r/girlgamers, even though I don't contribute much, because I like the reminders that there is a huge community of capable and enthusiastic female gamers out there.  

However, the reason this article irked me is that women in gaming is such a hot button issue right now, and this came out today, WITH a female contributor.  I try not to get angry on a regular basis, but such obvious exclusion feels pretty terrible- like, REALLY? We couldn't even get ZYNGA?   (And the cat doesn't count!)  It seems like gaming contributors would be more sensitive to these issues and try to be more inclusive.  I personally feel very left out when I look at things like that, like I'm looking into a boy's club with a ""no girls allowed"" sign.

Anyways, /endrant, just seems ridiculous that content coming out right now is still so biased.

Since moving in with him, and reading and discussing various things we read here on reddit or in the news, he has learned a lot. 

Several months after Anita Sarkeesian's kickstarter ended, someone had posted a rant blasting her for not getting anything done. He spoke to me defending this rant, and I informed him about the whole situation. He watched the Tedx talk. So far he's managed to watch both of her tropes vs. women in video games episodes before me. He also shares them with people along with her Ted talk whenever he gets the chance. I love it.

Today on r/gaming, a post was made about an ex-girlfriend breaking a guy's entire xbox game collection. While reading through the comments, my fiancé came across a guy who called the poster's girlfriend a ""cunt"" and said actions like these were the reason he did not have a girlfriend of his own. My fiancé responded that yeah, it must have nothing to do with the fact that he uses hateful gendered slurs against women. More people stood up to defend the sexist name calling, and he responded back. He lost karma over it. People love to validate their sexism (which is why this subreddit is here in the first place). 

I'm just really happy to have a guy who will stand up and say something when he sees/hears it. It's not easy to challenge the status quo. I think it makes a difference (more so in person rather than online) when a man calls out sexism, because I think a lot of people use it without thinking. If a woman calls him out, he may think about it, but it's easy to dismiss her opinion, since you're being sexist already anyway. When a guy calls him out, it unfortunately may hold some more weight to it, since he's the peer group he's trying to gain credit and validation with in the first place.

The streamer in a surprising move asked him kindly to stop and if he found the need to curse to please use non-gender specific terms. This really shocked me (in a good way), not only because LoL is known for having some of the worst behaved gamers but that a professional was bold enough to say something about it. It was a quick attempt to silence him, without any comment by the streamer on stream to justify his words, however, the player did stop, at least for that game. And this lead me to think: Do you all think there is still (realistic) hope to change the culture? Or did this player only listen because it was a male that told him to be quiet? Or because it was a respected professional?

I feel as if female andriods are always sexual, a sexual object, or in a position of servitude. 

* EDI in ME3 was given a sexy model for her android body. It could have been more efficient and better understood. She does actually show intentions of becoming more ""human"". However, every initial reaction to her is ""wow look how hot she is"". Every crew member comments on how hot she is after she installs herself into EVA. Even the Virmir survivor, who should be afraid of her. 

* Starcraft's android announcer for the humans is a beautiful woman's semi robotic face. She is of a female form, but really is mostly an object.

* In the ghost in the shell anime series, all androids in servitude are female. You can see them doing mundane tasks all the time and being ignored.


I think that male androids are always seen as something more than that. They are usually the ones being seen as developing humanity. or they are seen as a villain with more of a personality.

* ~~I cannot recall a proper male android in video games. Is this a problem in video games? It could probably be me just not having a big enough library of video games into that sector. I'm sure there are a bunch somewhere.~~ I FORGOT ABOUT HK-47 because i'm and idiot. But he's an example of evil with a personality and is not a sex object (unless you read fanfics)

* TNG's data is ""male"" and he is constantly trying to become more human. That is his ultimate goal in the series. 

* AI's main protagonist is male, it is shown discovering humanity and/or the concept of love. 

* The alien franchise has several male androids. 2 of which are ""evil"" but have values, the other one is shown to be good and have human values. However, all 3 are in servitude. But that servitude is more fleshed out and they have more personalities. Alien resurrection sucks too much for me to care. Sorry, Wynona. 



I found a video that sort of perfectly explains my feelings on the situation by showing a female android being built, questioning why, and then showing fear of being killed by a male programmer because she showed signs of thinking.

Personally, I've pretty much grown out of playing adventure games. But I used to play a lot of them when I was younger and have many fond memories of them. I hate when it sometimes seems like adventure games don't get any respect, like they are somehow now ""real games"". Especially in discussions about female portrayal. 

Yes, female portrayal issues aren't ""solved"" or non-existant just because one genre/some genres do better at it, and there aren't other, unique problems with portrayal in adventure games. But to me that doesn't mean that one should look down on the contribution adventure games have made to the history of gaming: 

- For me adventure games always game across as if they pretty much invented the ""reasonably/practically dressed female (often with a dose of smartass)"" trope, of female characters who just looked normal and dressed normal. Yes that can be bland on its own but imo that's pretty much the female version of the bland male ""slot in your own personality"" hero character. 

- Connectedly, Adventure games always seemed to have the highest frequency of having female characters that were designed maybe even intentionally to be pleasing/likable to women as well. Maybe there was a higher awareness of women as a/the target audience. 

- For me the first genre that had female Big Name creators. You didn't have to have any special interest or background to know about Roberta Williams. You knew her name because it was plastered across a lot of games you played/loved. 

Here a short selection of female playable characters and heroines in Adventure games: 

- Valanice and Rosella from King's Quest 7

- April from the Longest Journey

- Grace from Gabriel Knight

- Nancy Drew from the Nancy Drew games

- Nico from Broken Sword

- Kate from Syberia

- Nina from Secret Files Tunguska

- Erica from Cognition

- Adrienne from Phantasmagoria

- Thara from the Ankh series

- Laverne from Day of the Tentacle

- Zanthia Legend of Kyrandia Hand of Fate

- Victoria from Still Life

I think there could be merit in looking at the history of adventure games, how the genre ticks and in what way it evolved/didn't evolve.

I've personally seen a lot of my male friends in WoW insist that their SOs take on a healer role because: ""I'll do the important stuff, you just spam heals on me"" and one of my ex-girlfriends shied away from ARTSs using the logic that ""I'll probably suck at it"" (She had never played an ARTS before, so she had no way of knowing whether she'll suck or not) so this question came to my mind.

For that matter, I've been in matches in DotA2 where someone introduces themselves as a girl or belies the fact somehow during hero picking and then everyone insists they pick a support. This is completely ignoring the fact that support/healer roles may actually be HARDER in many games.

So I just bought CoD Black Ops 2 the other day. While I was playing (and kicking some serious butt I might add) I started to receive the messages. I don't go on microphone when I'm by myself simply because I don't find it necessary and I'm too lazy to move 3' to grab them. You might be asking yourself, how did they know you were a girl if you didn't have your mic on? Well, my gamertag. It's *ThatRandomChick*. Funny, right? Well, I've been told by both gamer guys and girls that with a username like that I have no right to be complaining. Mind you, I knew very well that I would be receiving messages with this name and tolerate them without complaint, but some of them toe that line, you know? People just get so nasty and I can't help but wonder if they have anything better to do with their lives. 

So I ask you. Was I asking for it? Do I deserve to be attacked day in and day out simply because I wanted a playful gamertag?

1376335078.0,55,self.GirlGamers,1k84d8,Something I've noticed about us disturbs me lately,bmiralle,73,18,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1k84d8/something_ive_noticed_about_us_disturbs_me_lately/,"Hi everybody,

I've been a member of this sub for a few months now, and I've really enjoyed the content that's been put forth here. I think there have been some great discussions (and I'm happy to have been a part of them) that are difficult to find on any other subreddit or forum regarding women in gaming.

That having been said, it lists on our sidebar:

&gt;**We seek to counter the phenomenon stated by the Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory**, and create a community of mutual respect and no harassment, so we can all have a pretty sweet time.

I've thought about this a little every now and then while reading some of the comments here, but some of the comments on the ""Girls are infiltrating games"" article (http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1k5gzv/oh_look_we_are_infiltrating_games/) bothered me enough to finally address it.

Basically, there are times when I feel like this subreddit isn't any different from the other reddits that are so frequently criticized here. I've always agreed with the idea that places like /r/gaming is pretty terrible when it comes to meaningful discussion and the Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory in general, but even in here I'm beginning to see things like downvoting for the wrong reasons, condescending attitudes and comments towards people who don't share a certain view (not giving them the mutual respect we claim to hold on the sidebar) and a whole lot of preaching to the choir. 

I just feel like it goes against our long-term interests if we're acting this way rather than friendly towards outsiders and those that don't share our views (to my experience, being friendly and respecting others' views go much further in expanding one's influence and support base). It's tougher going for sure compared to the instant gratification you feel when you shut down someone who you disagree with, but in the end you're just burning bridges you could have used later on to help foster a better community. Just because people from other subreddits and communites act like monkeys flinging crap doesn't mean we have to ""fight back"" using the same methods and behavior.

And I also understand that this isn't how literally every member in this subreddit acts; it's just a bit disheartening to see what I feel is an increase in the lowering quality of discussions and comments. I'm not sure if this is just a symptom of our fast growth, but it just makes me feel sad. 

I think in the example of the ""Girls Infiltrating Gaming"" article, a better thing to do would have been to invite them to a discussion on our subreddit, or at least present our points without sounding completely condescending and unapproachable (yeah that guy was a jerk, but we're better than that!).

This isn't the kind of explosion of bad behavior on the scale of some other subreddits (I'm thinking of /r/games in particular), but I feel a little anxious that we're undergoing the same exact process.

Does anybody else feel the same way? Or is it just an unfortunate wave of this kind of thing in a short instance? Maybe I'm just being paranoid and/or not fit for checking reddit.

He argued that nobody is really human in games, and that 'men' are just as bad in video games as women. He said they're always the same character, some middle-ages brown hair'd guy whose always either jaded or angry and whose goal is to protect/save their daughter, wife or girlfriend

So I argued, well at least your freaking gender isn't always the daughter, wife or girlfriend in need of saving. I said it feels shitty that there's just a complete lack of femtagonists in games, and brought up the point that at the microsoft conference there wasn't a single female protagonist.

So then he goes on to list a bunch of female protagonest, starting with resident evil 1-6, a couple silent hills and variety of other games. He continues to go on a tirade that 'you just can't understand what it's like to be a guy anyway. I'm so tired of being the same guy saving his girlfriend' 

And then he signed off (steam) and basically 'won'. I'm so tired of his attitude and I can't deal with him. He's been my best friend for years but whenever this topic comes up he gets extremely ""male gamer privilege"" on me and refuses to see my side, and argues that 'nobody is properly represented in video games', and it makes me feel like shit.

How do I deal with this kind of view? :/

Edit: Just fyi I know I used a lot of 'certain' words in this, like 'always' or 'complete lack'. But I find even if I'm lenient and go 'a lot of women are portrayed...' or 'there's not very many who..' I still get the same argument blown back at me, ""well what about x from y, or a from b? Or all of these females? Clearly you're wrong"". I do not know how to explain to them that a couple examples does not make me wrong :|

It is being sold on Amazon for 22$ brand spankin' new but of course I couldn't possibly wait 2 whole days for it to be shipped here before I got to play it! =P So I went to the Game Trader by my house but no such luck. They had no used copies but informed me that they would be getting a shipment of new ones in  a few days and would be selling them for 20$, but again, I wanted to play it NOOOOW (read in the blueberry girl's voice from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory =D) haha Anyways, so I called over to GameStop and asked if they had any copies, they did! Once I proceeded to ask how much they were selling it for he informed me the price of their used Portal 2 game for Xbox 360 was a whopping 40$.


FORTY DOLLARS!


I accientally laughed out loud which caused him to sit there in silence...Oops! Lol so just out of curiosity I asked him why it was so much when the price of the game new is $20. He said its because the game is so rare. 

Not sure about that one buddy! I know they did only make a finite number of them originally but recently made many more.  Apparently GameStop in all their infinite wisdom didn't get that memo. So I hopped over to Best Buy, literally a stones throw away from GameStop, and bought one of their 15 copies of the game, brand new, for 20$

First of all, I wanted to extend a huge ""thank you"" to those who participated.  There was a handful of creative respondents who bothered to send me obvious troll responses (e.g. ""I enjoy playing privilege-checking sims""). But even after accounting for all those, the response has been well beyond what I ever hoped for.

I'm sharing a couple of small tidbits for those who may find it interesting:

- The sample was surprisingly diverse, with participants spanning 30 different countries, as shown on [this map](http://www.traveltip.org/pix/visited_countries.php?ct=chinjamysnsfrqbedaenfifrgmeiimnlnoporssispswszukcausasnzbrco&amp;u=1).
- 74% of participants indicated that they somewhat or strongly agree with the statement, ""I enjoy playing multiplayer games.""  14% somewhat or strongly disagreed, and 11% indicated ""Neutral.""

Again, this is just a brief glance at the data; I'll post the whole project here when I've finished it.

Finally, I've created a separate survey for [men respondents](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IBp7KZyseIleZN2m5dD6a9oEn0Cr7G_-XJpJAs0TMgw/viewform) (men only for this one, please).  In the event that you're a trans man who took the women's survey, don't worry about it.  If I'd had the foresight to include a question to indicate sex/gender and kept it as one survey, I would have, but the decision to survey men came later.  I now figure that data on women's experiences in this case may mean little without data on men's experiences to which it can be compared.  If the gentlemen of this subreddit are interested in helping my research, I'd appreciate it tons.

The responses slowed down, so I decided to process and post the results.

Here's what women chose:

*  [Straight women](http://i.imgur.com/BEQCwRC.png)
*  [Bisexual women](http://i.imgur.com/mrRHuug.png)
*  [Lesbian women](http://i.imgur.com/adJwVoY.png)
*  [Transwomen](http://i.imgur.com/wrC6xv1.png) (People in this group are also counted in the previous three)

Here's what men chose:

*  [Straight men](http://i.imgur.com/mZuC2bd.png)
*  [Bisexual men](http://i.imgur.com/W60zWns.png)
*  [Gay men](http://i.imgur.com/Jhbspjz.png)
*  [Transmen](http://i.imgur.com/CRjJ0FO.png) (Overlaps)

The most prominent result here is that every group mostly plays as their own gender.  This effect is strongest with transwomen (90% choosing female) and weakest with bisexual men (52% choosing male game characters).  What's also interesting is that every female group has a stronger preference than it's equivalent male group (e.g. of straight women 77.3% chose mostly female, while among straight men only 54.6% chose mostly male game characters).

And lastly, here's what [third/other gender people chose](http://i.imgur.com/Wp99ITZ.png).

Obviously I moderate time spent etc so let's not go there... What she's asking me is which game is AC for girls? 

Tough chicks, fighting stuff, I know having them in clothes is going to be next to impossible but that would be nice.

She already plays LOL, Minecraft and likes Old school Tekken. 

EDIT TO ADD:  I'm the worlds worst parent when it comes to this stuff apparently but I do let her play AC (and shes kicking ass) and chop em, shoot em, kill em games. I like to be sensible about it and point out to her that its just a game and stuff, I think if we are direct about it then we avoid some of the psychosis that might be more probable if we banned everything.  In saying that though I know what sets off the little kid nightmares and what doesn't so of course I would check anything out before I let her play it.  

Anecdote for funnsies:  My favourite quote of hers was when we were watching Scooby Doo on Zombie Island and she preceded to tell all her friends it was VERY unrealistic because clearly Scooby Doo isn't real...

I'm not sure how many ladies here have played Mass Effect, but I'm assuming the vast majority, if not 100% have done so. I'm more interested however in how many of you gals (and guys) decided to play as FemShep.

FemShep is kinda interesting for a female lead, because while she seems almost like an afterthought (as so many female leads in ""Choose your gender"" games do) she is, in my opinion, the stronger character, the more well rounded character. To me FemShep IS Shepard.

I'm often surprised when Mass Effect merchandise, discussion, fancomics and packaging remind me that this is NOT the case.

When I play the Mass Effect games I play a mixed bag, strutting the line between Paragon and Renegade as I see fit and as I think MY Shepard WOULD behave.

When I gave Male Shepard a try I found this distinctly unfun for a number of reasons, in fact, I actually DISLIKE the male Shepard character completely.

When he makes Paragon choices he comes across as a stiff, when he makes Renegade choices he comes across as a dislikeable moron, and when you try to play both it's like watching the character suffer from a split personality.

When I play FemShep I feel like the character is organic; she flows between Paragon and Renegade and still seems like the SAME CHARACTER. Paragon comes across as a character with a high emphasis on military honour rather than a stiff, Renegade comes across as somebody looking top get the job done by any means, and DAMN the consequences, and the mix is one fluid Character which I can learn and shape as I go along.

Another interesting thing I've noticed is that many FemShep players often feel the same way about her, at least, they feel a great sense of loyalty to her as the ""real"" Shepard, or ""their"" Shepard, which I have to put down to her more consistent, more organic, more HUMAN character.

It seems like female gamer can only belong in one of two stereotypes. Either ""girls don't play video games!"" and we don't actually exist or, counter-intuitively, ""girls are the BEST at video games!"" 

I have seen the latter type more and more. A toy commercial will have two boys racing RC cars when a third pulls ahead and beats them all, only for the camera to pan back to show...surprise! It was a girl! Whenever there is a legitimate female character in a gaming webcomic, she will not just be a gamer, but she will be the *best* gamer out of all the characters. Lilah from Ctrl+Alt+Del comes to mind here. Even sites dedicated to real stories from female gamers, like fatuglyorslutty.com, usually feature delicious justice porn stories of women suffering from harassment only to decimate their harasser with their superior gaming skills.

When I first noticed this trope I thought it was a step in the right direction. Girls being good at video games was better than girl being bad at video games, right? But more and more I began to feel intimidated by the lack of a middle ground. To put it bluntly: I'm not good at video games. I don't *suck*, but I'm not going to be setting any records or earning MVP for most games no matter how much practice I get. And hey, that's probably totally normal. If *everyone* was amazing then all ""amazing"" play would just be average, right? It'd be mathematically impossible for *every* player to have a killer K/D ratio.

But the more I see the dichotomy of ""girls suck at games"" to ""girls are best at games,"" the more uncomfortable I get with playing games in online multiplayer. It's started to feel like ""girls *have* to be the best at games, or else they suck,"" and I know I don't fit into the former category. 

It's so intimidating. I want people to think I'm bad just because I happen to be bad, not because I'm a girl. And I am terrified of making a mistake and affirming stereotypes about all women because of it. I feel like the luxury of being allowed to be average is hugely overlooked. I actually stopped playing games online because it was impossible not to feel like a spokesperson for every female gamer, and even more so not to feel like I was letting girl gamers everywhere down when I didn't perform well in a game.

I'd love to hear input from others on this. Has anyone else noticed this other stereotype? Does anyone else feel like an ambassador for female gamers whenever they play? What can be done to counteract this?",,False,self,t5_2rfec,False,,xbox,True,t3_1hzvt3,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1hzvt3/it_sucks_to_suck/,

To keep a long story short, my brother has Down's Syndrome. He's been in love with [this game](http://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Sorcerers-Stone-Pc/dp/B00005N7YQ) since it came out, but the family computer- still with Windows XP- is on its last days. My family was thinking of replacing the computer, but then my brother would be unable to play his favorite game. 

My mom asked me and my sister for some game ideas that he might enjoy because his birthday is coming up, but we couldn't think of many ideas. So, I'm asking you all for some suggestions for some very easy games for my brother. We have a Wii as well, and he particularly enjoys [this game](http://www.amazon.com/Monsters-vs-Aliens-Nintendo-Wii/dp/B001PKHRSW/ref=sr_1_1?s=videogames&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371251983&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=monsters+vs+aliens+game). Generally, a controller other than the Wiimote is a bit too hard for him, and he doesn't do any kind of shooters or RPGs, and he also is not a fan of any Lego games. I'd say racing games, platformers, or any games with familiar characters he'd be interested in (Wii or PC). Thanks for your help!

Edit: Thank you all for your suggestions! I hope to go to the library and/or Gamestop today and pick up some Wii games.

I've had some super creepy, super rude, mean and nasty guy following me around for like, 6 months now. I play a Steam game that has a pretty devout community that's not terribly large - maybe 500 players at the most. He's going on his second IP ban from their official forum for stalking me, I had to turn off the ""anonymous"" ask me option from my tumblr because he would leave me messages every other day. I have PMs from him where he talks about how he's a) crazy, b) obsessed with me and c) will never leave me alone.

It got to the point where I didn't post on the forum for almost two months (which was kind of a big deal - I was a member of the game dev sponsored community team, had 2k posts) because this guy would respond to everything and anything I said. I think most women on the internet have had a guy who ""took a liking to them"" a little too much but I've never had someone come after me so vehemently, so endlessly and for so little (we didn't know each other before hand, got into some disagreement on the forums and I called him an asshole).

After I received a series of PMs from him, about being crazy and such, it actually freaked me the fuck out. I hate that this guy is able to intimidate me and I hate myself for letting him get the reaction out of me that he was hoping for.

I said I've touched the game very briefly but it didn't click for me. So he continued; ""Black Ops?"" - I shook my head. ""Counter-strike?"" had me saying no. Finally he went for Skyrim and I once again had to say that sorry, no I've not really played it for more than a few minutes.

He didn't come out and say it, but I saw his face turning. As of today, I was to be a fraud in his eyes. And this guy, I just know I was doing late-nighters (against my parents' will!) on my NES before he was even born. At the time of this talk, I was wearing an N7 hoodie á la Mass Effect. Around this time last year, I placed well in a nation-wide Street Fighter tournament. And he had the gall to give me that gaze, that smug yet disappointed look of superiority of having called out a liar. I feel so insulted just thinking about it, yet at the time I found myself just sitting there dumbfounded - somehow bested. Argh!!

My dad only allowed me to buy games I could play in my age group and even then, I made sure not to let him see me play the more profane and gory ones, because I was a girl. I had to wait until I was 13 to play teen and 17 to play M (but by that age, I was able to buy my own).

Then the golden child, the first male in my family. He gets everything. Because he's a boy, he could play with guns, with games, stay out late, play with ANYONE he wants of ANY GENDER. He's 10 and our dad bought him MGS. He's getting him Halo soon. I am SO PISSED. I wasn't allowed to play those games when I was his age.

I know everyone has already thrown in their two cents on that, but I did my level best to drop a dime. Not brag, but I think I may have compiled the most comprehensive collection of links and videos in one place to put the whole story in a broader context. I did my best to find a silver lining without in any way diminishing the horror of what happened. If anything, I may have gone overboard with cataloging the horror (let me know).

There have been a few times I've rolled my eyes at female gamers on Reddit for ""not being able to take a joke.""

I'm really sorry.

Because I was coming from a different perspective I didn't take the time to understand the kind of harassment online gamers face, ostensibly because of your gender. Threats of violence are not okay against anyone, especially in a forum as trivial and (supposedly) lighthearted as a video game.

/u/ChaosLFG took the time to explain it to me in detail [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/LadyMRAs/comments/zsnev/a_shining_white_knight_comes_to_the_rescue_of_the/c67g6c1). As a parent with two small children I am absolutely horrified.

As a person who attempted suicide at the age of 13 as the result of bullying I'm pissed off.

But most of all I'm really, really sorry for not taking the time to listen.

Edit: On the topic of feminism, I consider myself a civil rights activist rather than limiting it to gender / sexual orientation / etc. I'm an ""MRA"" in the sense that I argue for men's rights. I would also be a women's rights activist, an LGBT activist (I'm bisexual), etc.

There's a term ""oppression Olympics"" which I love - basically it's not about who is *more* oppressed but rather addressing injustice as it's presented.

I often feel like I don't have enough ""nerd cred"" to be considered a ""girl gamer"". You guys have *in no way* made me feel like this, it's really just my own insecurities, but...I was wondering if anyone else ever feels this way?

I love video games, but when I think of people who consider themselves gamers (males and females alike), it seems like I really don't play that much. I've never played Mega Man, Metroid, or Street Fighter. Never owned a SNES or NES. Never played any of the classics, like FF7 or MGS. But worst of all, I don't really play any big FPS games. No Halo, CoD, or Battlefield. And for some reason, that makes me feel invalidated. Sure, I play TF2 and L4D, but for some reason, those feel like they ""don't count"" in my head.

Sorry, maybe I'm just rambling, but sometimes I feel like as a girl, I have to go above and beyond to be considered a ""gamer"" instead of a ""casual"" (which I know is a silly and arbitrary distinction)...I'm not allowed to be a beginner at Halo, because if I suck it's because I'm a girl and not because I'm inexperienced. It's unfortunate, because I'd like to give it a try again (haven't played since the first one), but I don't want to deal with that crap. So instead, I stick to ""safe"" games like Skyrim and Fallout and occasionally venture into Soul Calibur for some couch play with a few friends (but never online).

Haha, I have no idea what my point was, but I really felt like I needed to get that off my chest, and this felt like an ok place to do it, seeing as I don't have any close IRL girl friends, gamer or otherwise!",,False,self,t5_2rfec,False,,steam,True,t3_wg3wh,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/wg3wh/does_anyone_ever_feel_like_they_dont_have_enough/,

I want to hear it from you guys since I respect this subreddit a lot. Don't hold anything back at me. There's this one line of thinking of mine that is pretty judgemental, and I'm not sure whether it makes me part of the problem or not.

I'll take [Yoko](http://i336.photobucket.com/albums/n340/ShowRender/Render%20by%20ZeeH/Tengen%20Toppa%20Gurren%20Lagann/YokoRitona.png) (Guren Lagann) cosplayers as an example of what happens in my brain. It happens in more cases than this, but it's a very pure form of the whole predicament I think.

Yoko as a character, at least the way I've always seen her, is pretty much not a character. She's hot character design and sometimes, rarely, she plays a part in the battle choreography by being a support sniper while the men do the actual fighting. In most fights she doesn't even get to do that, and she has no plots or character arcs of her own.

Thus I personally don't see anything worth celebrating with a cosplay here. I've done cosplay myself and I don't mean to sound elitist (talk about being a bitch too if I was an elitist cosplayer after having done it only once!), but I simply liked this character a ton so I dressed up as her. But I just can't see what could possibly make it worth dressing up as Yoko.

... unless you wanted people to look at you and find you hot, that is. The moment I see a Yoko cosplayer, I label her an attention whore in my head. That doesn't mean she's a bad person, not by any means, but she does have this one trait in my mind.

I also don't think she's a poser, it sounds incredibly stupid to me that she would start watching anime just to get people to look at her. Not to mention Guren Lagann isn't really that famous of a show either so she has probably watched quite a freaking bit if she comes up with Yoko. Still, I'm labelling her as somebody who dresses up to have people drool over her since she's cosplaying a personality-free redhead in a bra.

Am I a part of the problem? And If I'm not, am I a judgemental bitch? If I am, then I have no follow-up questions; I'll just have to learn to stop thinking like this.",,False,self,t5_2rfec,False,,,True,t3_185404,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/185404/am_i_part_of_the_problem_this_whole_fake_geek/,

It's just one of the most refreshing games and I'm kind of amazed by it. You just can't expect much from fighting games and their depictions of women but this is so many steps in the right direction. 

It's also a great jumping off point if you are new to the fighting game scene. Lots of tutorials, lessons, bot play before you even have to touch the online fighting.

But the issue here is surely one of self-expression - why should I be afraid to express myself how I want? Why should I have to conform in order to be treated the same as others?

Whenever I bring it up, people tell me to shut up and stop flouting it, or I get called an attention seeker, or told to just put up with it because its 'banter'.

This particular game store is very casually owned and run. The employee at the counter started looking up the prices and mentioned that the games were really good and asked me if they were my boyfriend's. I said they were mine and that it was a shame I had to sell them. He didn't believe me and started quizzing me on random game trivia from the games I was selling. He wasn't rude about it or anything and we had a good time talking about the games. 

I decided to look around the store for a while and promptly make my way to the back where all the SNES games are. Another employee follows me and tells me that he saw that I sold Final Fantasy IX and told me how much he loved the game. I agreed and went on a mini-rant about how much I love Vivi. He suddenly gets super close to me and breathes down my neck that his favorite scene was [the wedding scene at the end.](/spoiler)

Also at this store, they've semi-jokingly said that they'll give me my purchases for a huge discount/free if I make out with them. Even more awkward for me is that they usually give me a huge discount for no reason whatsoever. Spending less money is always great, but they really shouldn't do that. It makes me feel really awkward.

**EXHIBIT B:** Another time, I went into Gamestop specifically looking for a used copy of the PS2 port of Resident Evil 4. Their used PS2 section was a mess, but I managed to find the game. I decided to dig through the rest of the section to see if they had anything good. During my time in the store, an employee kept asking me if I needed help finding anything about three times more than usual. After a while, he asked me what my favorite game was; to avoid bursting into full-on nerd mode and going on a way too passionate rant about Fire Emblem for the next four hours, I said it was Morrowind and we talked about TES for a while, which was fine.

However, after we got talking, he began hounding me to work there so that they would ""have something to look at."" I didn't want to be rude and tried to very politely tell him no and that his statement was rude. He told me I was asking for it for wearing a skirt. 

Has anyone else had similar experiences? The employees probably weren't trying to creep me out, but they should treat me like any other customer.

Here's a blurb about what they're about:

&gt; Gamers Against Bigotry was created with one purpose in mind: to create a gaming community that is welcoming to gamers of all identities.  Gaming is awesome.  And online multiplayer gaming is more awesome.  But it sucks that gamers have to choose to not play online, or to deal with a relentless barrage of identity-based hate slung their way if they do log in.
Bigotry isn’t part of gaming culture, and it never has been; it’s just unfounded hatred, masked by anonymity.  It’s something we need to put an end to. 

Right now it looks like they're still in the planning stages, but have created a pledge for people to sign and have the opportunity for people to also signed up to volunteer. I've personally already signed on to it myself, and plan on also applying to be a volunteer. 

You can read more about it as well as sign the pledge here: http://gamersagainstbigotry.org/pledge/

Basically, I guess I'm wondering if people think this could work?

I hope I'm not breaking any rules. I just got so excited seeing it on sale that I had to share in case someone hasn't played it yet. I highly recommend this game if are looking to immerse yourself into a deep, rich universe and play as a female hero.

Plus, it is super mod friendly. There are TONS of awesome mods available, everything from extensive gameplay tweaks to environment enhancements to little things like pretty hair/faces/armor/makeup for your character. 

I recommend playing as Cousland first because you get the broadest cultural perspective on the history of Ferelden and then branch off as an elf or dwarf the second time to really get into the nitty-gritty bits. Just a warning, though, the female city elf origin can be triggering for some.

**Ross** (parental): You're going to have to learn how to make sacrifices....

This exchange really struck me, because I've been playing video games for a long, long time, and I'm not sure I've ever heard a conversation quite like this one before. It's not that I haven't played lots of well-written games, I certainly have. But even the most well-written video games don't tend to have little moments of reflection like this, probably because most video games are written by men for men, and reflection, particularly subtle reflection, isn't a big part of the masculine playbook. We’re supposed to manly men of action, after all. Don’t debate, DO! Look at, say, the Arkham games, which were expertly penned by Paul Dini. Batman certainly argues with various people about which things should be done and how they should be accomplished, but there’s nothing like this. Ezio has hours of dialog across three games, but again, nothing like this. There’s a subtlety to this scene that you just don’t normally find in video games. (And of course it helps that the voice acting and character animation in Tomb Raider is absolutely top-notch.)

Now I don't know for certain that Rhianna Prachett wrote that exchange, but I can’t shake the suspicion that she did. I can’t say for sure that a similar conversation wouldn’t happen in a game with a more standard male protagonist, but I certainly can’t remember any. (and I’ve played a LOT of 'em) There is nothing explicitly *feminine* about this scene, but I honestly don’t think it would have happened in a game without so much female participation, both on screen and behind screen. And this in a cross-platform, triple-A title, marketed to everyone!

You see, for me, I almost very rarely get the hate for being a gamer girl. I've very rarely actually been insulted or called out on it. However I deal with A LOT of white knights and I want some advice on how to deal with it.

So as of right now, I am in a guild in World of Warcraft, that does some pretty hardcore raids. So of course we're required to use Vent/raidcall, and that's where it started happening when people found out my gender. Pretty much some of them (about 3 of them) have been trying to get on my good side I guess and have been trying to shower me in items and gold. Seems like every week one of them will mail me a mount or a pet or A LOT of gold, which is getting really annoying because I'm not the kind of person to accept things like that. So I pretty much instantly return these items. I've told them multiple times now to stop sending me items, which works for maybe a week or two, then they start again.

Also EVERY time I try and talk in vent (though which usually isn't much because I'm insanely shy and don't talk much)  that isn't calling something out while raiding, like just chatting during down time one of the white knights ALWAYS has to reply with SOMETHING, to me, which gets really annoying because then the conversation immediately shifts focus to me.

I don't really want to start any type of drama in the guild, so I definitely don't want to just tell them to stfu, so does anyone know of any good ways to tell them to maybe ease off a little?

That women will invariably have to act ""male"" to be a good protagonist. One guy said something along the lines of ""what is the game gonna be about tampons, rape whistles and wonderbras durh hurh?""

But I was playing Alice Madness Returns for the second time this eve (played through it once on Xbox, loaned it to my brother never to be seen again, bought it for 5 bucks on Steam during a sale) and while it's a decent action platformer with some great visuals, it also got me thinking about games with feminine leads and/or with femininity as a theme.

I never played the first Alice, but this one is ripe with female themes and issues. First of all in the real world Alice is robbed of power, she's living in 19th century London after all. There's a big theme of prostitution in the background, most of the women in the district where she is having had to resort to it to survive. 

But Alice is still bold and observant, every bit as sarcastic as the Alice of the books and aware that there are several people in her life who are or are trying to take advantage of her but there isn't a whole lot she can do about it given she's 19, living in a home for wayward children and still considered quite mad. But in Wonderland she has *power*. And eventually that becomes power in her real life as well (though the extent to which Wonderland is real is ambiguous.)

Even so she gets her powers from cool dresses and weapons like a knife, a giant pepper grinder, a scalding teapot and a hard-hitting hobbyhorse. 


There are two other games I've countered this argument with as well: Bayonetta and Silent Hill 3.

Bayonetta is all about the weaponizing femininity. Her high heels are guns, her sexuality is like campy superhero bravado, her hair (very important aspect of femininity in Japan) summons demons, lipstick is bullets, accessorizing gives you power ups for certain weapons etc. It's glorious, and it's a hell of a fun game with a great style, a great sense of humor, and fast action gameplay that is smooth as butter to control.

Silent Hill 3, likewise, is all about female themes. It stars a female protagonist, Heather, and every single visual in the game is symbolic of pregnancy, puberty, and other female anxieties and pressures. It's also fun to play, has a great plot (if more straight-forward than other Silent Hill games) and is subversive and scary as hell.

I've heard people give a sort of feminist interpretation of Portal as well given the two big players are both female and the portals are rather, erm, *yonic* in nature, but I'm thinking that was less deliberate...

Can you all think of any other games that wouldn't be the same if the lead wasn't female or is seeped in female themes? ",,False,self,t5_2rfec,False,,all,True,t3_1hgvuf,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1hgvuf/femininity_cant_work_in_games/,

",roflwafl,40,3,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/13iy5g/how_do_you_deal_with_genderbased_heckling_if/,"The standard response I read in all these posts seems to be ""kick their butt."" But what if you can't do that?



I love gaming. Video, tabletop, whatever. I've never been very competitive, so I generally play story-driven games and stay away from PvP type deals. As a result, when it comes time for gaming with friends or at lan parties, I can't hold my own and feel like a bad reflection on female gamers as a whole. 



The obvious solution, I suppose, is to practice these kinds of games until I can keep up with the rest. But,

A) I don't have time for that. 

B) I game for my own enjoyment, not to validate myself in anyone else's eyes. 



Generally when I express these sentiments or play poorly with others, I get dismissed as an attention seeking fake. But, when I presented as male yesterday at work and said the same things, they included me in the discussion and agreed that some of them were non-competitive gamers as well. It was nice to be treated as just a gamer, not a girl-gamer, but I'd love to have that kind of respect every day. 



Has anyone else experienced this problem? How do you deal with these things aside from demonstrating competitive skill?

Especially if the game took place in an indoor setting--ugh, forget it!  I was crawling off the chair and onto the nearest sofa or bed just to lay down for a few minutes to shake it off.  And the older the game (read: the worse the graphics), the worse I'd feel.  This naturally meant that I've miss out on a lot of really great games *sad face :(*

BUT I have been DYING to play Bioshock Infinite.  I've watched other people play the first one and very little of Infinite which has helped getting used to it a little.  I noticed that I don't feel as crappy when you're in an open, outdoor setting as opposed to an indoor setting.  If I start getting a headache, I'll put my head down for a minute or two and feel ok.

So I know about changing the FOV (which luckily for me is readily available in Bioshock Infinite), but I wanted to know if there's anyone who's got any tips on getting over gaming nauseousness, maybe someone's who gotten over it themselves.  Thank in advance!

**tl;dr - I get nauseous playing FPSs, but want to play Bioshock Infinite.  Aside from changing the FOV, has anyone got any tips to getting over the sick feeling?  Has anyone else gone through this before and gotten over it? Thanks!**

Recently, she's  gotten into TranZit mode in BLOPS 2 (really into it, she's good), and enjoys it much more than I do (she enjoys the slower meta game, I do not). She normally plays with her sister (who's rarely on, they're both working professionals), but most of the time she just searches by herself, and because she's actually a good player and believes in teamwork, she has a headset on. 

Now, if you know anything about randoms on XBL COD, you won't be surprised to find that she gets matched up with a bunch of squeakers and immature men who freak the fuck out when they realize they're playing with women. They've been assholes to her and her sis, and even though she plays better than most of them, she'll still get a lot of shit from these players when the others players die/suck/etc. She's tired of getting matched up with morons and spends a good amount of her time finding a lobby, talking to randoms, finding out they're morons then researching for a new lobby before the match begins. 

She really loves this game, and I know she'll have a blast playing zombies with other women. She isn't a Redditor, but her boyfriend is, so hopefully I can surprise her with a bunch of new zombie slaying sisters.  So if any of you awesome girl gamers on XBL would like to play some Zombies with her, just let me know in the comments section and I'll relay the info to her. Thanks!

We're putting together a conference for young women to meet other women in the industry and to build a community and network as they enter the field!

Happening on April 14th in the UC Irvine Student Center, init(together) is a Southern California conference for women starting their careers in computing.  

We have a different take than most 'women in computing/tech' conferences; we're highlighting the startup and media-oriented technology culture (games, app development, art) that have a severe lack of women.  We want to demonstrate that women can pursue their own visions through many creative outlets in tech (where video games, apps, makerspaces and other tech media come in), and that tech empowers women to make differences in the world.

So we're looking for: 

* Game companies to showcase their work (and maybe look for interns/hires) 

* For women in the games industry to come and mentor college and high school women who want to pursue game development or design. 

* Of course, we are also looking for young women who want to go into the field to attend the conference!

[**Here**](http://init-together.com/) is the conference website, with the schedule and details. Also: maybe join our [**Facebook page**](http://www.facebook.com/init.together.conference), we're trying to spread the word :D

How can I support her?**
___
Hey everybody! First post here, I was wondering if anybody here can give me a hand with a small dilemma. Well, dilemma isn't the right word. More like, ""saddening state of affairs"". I'm trying to find a way to help my girlfriend get past the mindset of ""girls don't play video games,"" so she can actually enjoy some of them.

Let me explain a bit more before anybody jumps down my throat and says, ""Hey, douchenozzle! Stop trying to force your girl to play with you!"" This isn't that. You see, my girlfriend actually can game, enjoys gaming, and can regularly kick my ass-- which I love. However, when she ventures into the bowels of the internet and shops by herself, she's immediately greeted with the swarms of guys who either hate her or hit on her. It's very discouraging for her, and is driving her to start thinking that maybe gaming isn't for her.

I'd like to help out however I can, but this is kind of new to me! I've never been a support system for gaming; usually it's other things like life crisises or work problems. What should I be doing to be supportive? Am I being helpful, or am I just pushing my way onto her?

**Update: 8/26/2012**

So, I shared all your advice with my girlfriend (who, btw has never heard of Reddit before yesterday. So now I have the guilt of ruining her life forever from here on out. ;) ) and she seems to be pretty open to the ideas presented. The biggest one is that she wants to start gaming with me beyond when we are at each other's places-- we have game nights during the week, so now we're planning to open those sessions out to the broader net so she can wade in the wider pool of the net. I've talked to two of our friends, a live in couple that are both pretty avid gamers, to see if they want to party up every once in a while. Once she feels a bit more comfortable with all of us ""there"", she'll see if she's interested in branching off on her own. I've already passed on the information about this sub, as well as all the helpful groups you've all passed on to me.

1368397275.0,33,self.GirlGamers,1e7h5w,I thought I'd actually be able to be treated as a normal person while playing Dota 2 with friends....,lunarwinter,39,6,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1e7h5w/i_thought_id_actually_be_able_to_be_treated_as_a/,"I was wrong.

TL;DR: Playing Dota 2 with friends, first match I'm babied and hit on, second match I'm called a slut who shouldn't be playing video games because it's ""outside the social norm"".

So, yesterday, my friends and I decided to play some Dota 2, as we make a decent team together. We get a skype call going and all that good stuff, but our usual 4th and 5th party member can't make it. No big deal, we can just play with random people (who hopefully would be waayyyyy better than us) and have a fun time.

Lolnope. Everything was going fine at first, the people we got pared with seemed pretty good, and we had a nice dynamic of heros. Things seemed to be pretty swell for a little bit. Until I asked the other members if someone could buy a courier for the team, as I was going solo in mid lane, and couldn't exactly leave. They were at the shop at the time, anyway. 

Creep #1: ""Since you have such a cute voice, sure.""

By this time, I'm used to this kind of stuff, but I did not expect it on Dota, whose community is usually as hostile as a rabid tiger in heat, female or not. Whatever, they bought a courier, all is good, right? 

Think again. At this point I guess they decided that I wasn't able to handle a lane by myself because of my delicate female genitals and started to try and lane with me, making sure I wasn't ganked by the other teams mid lane-er. I'd honestly be okay with this if it wasn't so early in game and if they weren't stealing my farm by being there. I decided to go to a different lane with one of my friends, as they were having a hard time with their lane mates were now with me.

Creep #2: ""Why are you running away, princess?""

At this point they started pretty much following me around the map, continuing with comments like that. Because of this and said farm stealing, me running around trying to lane, and them leaving my friends to die by themselves, by mid-game I was underleveled, the other team was fed, we lost.

When that was over, one of our friends was able to play with us, so we then had a team of 4. We were happy, maybe this time, we could have a legit match. But, as you have probably guessed by now, it's never this simple. The match begins, everyone picks their hero, and we're ready to have a fun time. We decide to wish the other team good luck and get acquainted, and they seem pretty cool. Things were looking up until our teammate told the other team to ""fuck off and go suck a dick"" and how we shouldn't be conversing with the ""enemy team"". 

Well, fuck us for wanting to be friendly, right? We apologized to the other team for our guy being a douche and went on with our game. Then one of the other team's guys said his internet was acting up and they needed to reset it, and asked us if we could wait 2 minutes. We said sure and paused the game. At this point, Douchenozzle is raging at us and the other team, literally screaming into voice chat. He decides to unpause it, despite the situation. This leads to an unpausing-pausing duel between everyone else and him continually raging. I ask him to stop over voice chat, and he immediately pauses, as if stunned.

DN: ""Who just said that in a girlish voice?""

I facepalmed. The guys start laughing, knowing where this was going.

Me: ""Um, I did.""

He pauses.

DN: ""I'm just going to ask what we're all thinking. Why are you playing this game?""

Me: ""Because it's fun...?""

DN: ""Girls don't play Dota. It's against the social norms. Why are you playing this?""

He then proceeded to make sexist comments and rage at us for trying to be considerate of the other team. So, we decided to have a party back at out base. We even had a congo line going, and then the other team joined along after we told them what was happening. We laughed and had a fun time fucking around listening to his raging. He continued to blame me for everything, saying how ""this is what happens when a girl plays dota"" and how I need to ""go outside and play with makeup like the slut I am"". Despite his general dickishness throughout the entire thing, all of us had a lot of fun just messing around and we even make a few friends. Twas nice.

Anyway, I just had to rant about my adventures of the congo in Dota 2. I had a pretty sweet time, despite being surrounded by fuckwads. Twas coolio.

1350678048.0,33,self.GirlGamers,11rkpy,Small rant about guild applications and gender,brandnewaquarium,44,11,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/11rkpy/small_rant_about_guild_applications_and_gender/,"So I play a LOT of Warcraft.  I'm pretty well ranked on multiple classes because it's a game that I've played since it launched, and I've always found myself (somehow) in well-ranked guilds due to skill.

However, this has always come with a price.  I remember that once I was denied an officer spot as a Healing Leader (even though I was an acting healing leader) because of gender - they gave it to a priest who didn't know one class from another, and who turned out to be very poor at his job.  They were worried that other raiders would not respond well to a female voice on Ventrilo.  Then later, another person in another guild claimed I only received a raid spot because I (sorry for language) ""sucked the raid leader's dick"" (raid leader and I were IRL friends since high school.  I've never even seen his dick, and never will.  I received my spot because I was a dependable healer who worked very hard and knew the class and position I was playing very well.)

I've since moved on from there, or so I thought.

So, moving away from history lessons, let me note that some of the top Warcraft guilds have core members that just happen to be female.  Blood Legion, one of the top ranked guilds in the United States and kind of a media/PR point for much of Warcraft's raiding scene, is one of these - and I happen to know another girl who is close friends with many of the people in there.  She'll remain anonymous, but you kind of can tell where I'm taking this - as has been discussed in this subreddit, misogyny is outdated but overpracticed in gaming but only a small segment of the population seem to realize this.

Anyway, long story longer, I found myself in a place where I was looking for a new guild, so as I typically do, I began from the top down.  I started out by applying to a guild that happened to have people in my area, because their times and PvP attracted me...

...and ended up not receiving a single response to my application.  I was essentially pocket vetoed, and informed by the GM in-game that I would be denied because I am a girl, and girls cause drama.

So I applied at the top-ranked guild on my server, which I had contacts in at one point.

Denied.  Female.  Girls don't tank or PvP.  (let's ignore that one of the best rated PvP Druids during I think 2009 happened to be played by a female).

Another guild actually reached out to me around this time, because...  well, because I'm female, they wanted to recruit me.  At first I felt excited because, hey, a guild wanted me!  They'd seen my theorycrafting and knew I knew my stuff!

Then I did a quick search on them, and realized the kind of harassment I'd probably receive there and the actual reason why I had been recruited.  Not a good idea.

Anyway, in the end, I did get accepted to a guild that happens to work very well for me - their times are perfect, their environment incredibly humble, and my RL friends play on that same server and said that they were a great group to run with.  It's very win-win, and I decided to accept their offer.

But I can't help but comment on the fact that they commented on the fact that I'm female.  I'm choosing to ignore that because I know how women can be.  (Also, as an unrelated point, they happened to be ranked several levels above the other guilds I had applied at.)

And for those wondering:  **each and every one of these guilds had a required question in their application as to what the gender of the applicant was.  Every time I contacted them to see why this was a requirement, I was informed that they DO recruit females - including the one that pocket vetoed my application - and upon applying was told that ""girls cause drama and that's why we don't accept them or we hold them to a higher standard.""**

I'm sorry, but that's outdated.  And if you're that well-ranked, then you should be holding EVERYONE to the same standard - male OR female.  MEN CAUSE DRAMA, TOO.  I've got a track record of being able to not die, do really well at whatever role I happen to be playing (I am currently a tank/melee DPS, and have previously had very high ratings for PvP), and I've never found myself in the middle of drama I've created or found myself handed stuff because I sent someone a picture of my tits (for the record, no pictures of those currently exist, and any time they ask I send them the link to the Wikipedia article about Blue-footed Boobies).

I'm sorry.  I really just wanted to rant, because I'm sure that many people here have been there - I know clans exist on other games, so I'm curious how they've changed or evolved in other titles other than Warcraft.",,False,self,t5_2rfec,False,,bnet,True,t3_11rkpy,http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/11rkpy/small_rant_about_guild_applications_and_gender/,

Let me know what you think! I'm super interested in getting some different opinions and unique perspectives on it.
