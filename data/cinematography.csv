I work as an editor/shooter in TV and corporates. I've taken several courses on lighting, but I'd like to focus on something that often gets overlooked -- examples of poor/weak/bad lighting and detailing exactly what is poor about it.

Often the courses show a lot of good ideas, but without a good knowledge of bad ideas, I fear I'm only understanding half of the picture.

Without any unneccessary bashing or meanness, I want to see &amp; hear about your own mistakes, poor lighting you've seen on TV or in films, common mistakes beginners or amateurs make, etc. Screenshots would be great.

I'm particularly interested in lighting faces.

Thanks in advance.

I often get a lot of flack for spending unusual amounts of time considering the new technologies that are emerging in cinematography/imaging.  I always go back to a quote from Wayne Gretzky:  ""I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.""

The following are technologies that have come to my attention over the past two years that equally excite, scare, and confuse me as a DP.

Depth Capture:

Regardless of how you feel about Avatar's (or even Beowulf's) visual styles, I think they illustrate the interesting abstractions that one can conjure up using motion/depth/performance capture on a virtual stage.  

That said, just like RAW video, these technologies are potentially harmful for the unprepared cinematographer (and everyone on set except the director) mainly because they take away our abaility to ""bake in"" our artistic choices.
  
You think you got burned when you shot everything in RAW and the producers/director went in and completely changed the entire look of the film after you spent weeks of coloring it?  That was only the tip of the iceberg.  The only solution going forward seems to be to lock in your level of control in the contract negotiation phase, but that's another discussion entirely.

Nonetheless, there are a few exciting (and equally frightening) benefits that I think we'll see that not many people expect from this technology.  

Luddites, please ready your barf bags. 

- changing camera angle: if the depth is captured alongside a stream of cameras that capture color and luminosty and are arranged orthoginally, we have an infinite abilitiy to alter the angle in post.

- lighting: depth/color/luminosity can be a deadly combination for relighting.  Currently, relighting is limited because it requires a huge amount of quasi-manual modeling and/or bullet-time style geometric reconstruction.  What happens when the 3D data is part of that stream?  

- focus: If the computer knows what depth everything is at, there won't be as much of a need to create that depth in-camera.  This may bring us back to the days of 2/3"" sensors and deep focus shooting if we can later add depth effects in post.
OR this tech could actually allow us to more accurately stay in focus on absolutely mammoth sensors.  Software could be developed to more faithfully follow points in space if there's a depth stream that is already being captured...(super Easy Focus/mutant panatape).

- atmospheric effects: point clouds are the secret ingedient for this kind of immersive CG as well.  The endless hours spent pulling depth from flat images would be gone.

- keying: if the software already knows where the edges are, we (probably) won't need to rely as heavily on a green screen.  Imagine the lighting that could be accomplished if you didn't need to pull a clean key from that digital green backdrop?  This may even open up a whole new world of using display technologies for lighting/actor immersion.  
I understand that this is directly proportional to the resolution of the captured point cloud, but a combination of both would certainly be more accurate than either seperately.

- lens distortion:  You woud be able to add it or subtract it.  Perhaps this may bring about a style where you could shoot high resolution on a fisheye and compensate in post for the spacial/barrel distortion inherent to such optics.  You could get all of your coverage from one lens and take... which leads me to the next technology that I see on the horizon:

Vector Imaging:

This is a potentially world-shattering technological advance that was recently achieved by students at Bath University.

http://opus.bath.ac.uk/32970/

Some excerpts from ""CONSTRUCTING AND RENDERING VECTORISED PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES"" 

""Vector formats, historically associated with drawn images rather than with photographs, can provide a resolution-independent format but none of the exist­ing fully automatic fill rules for vector formats work well on photographic images. This paper describes a new fill regime based on diffusion which results in images which are visually indistinguishable from their originals after conversion into and out of a vector representation. There are a number of systems and plug-ins available to turn images into vector form (e.g. Adobe Live TraceTM) but they are all compromised by the absence of a good rule for determining vary­ing colour values in a continuous field. Tools like Live TraceTM extract isochromic contours from sampled images but have to extract a sufficiently large number of contours to preserve the illusion of a smooth sur­face on a sampled display. This is because the usual rule for automatically filling between contours is to provide a constant colour (here called flat fill) in the viewable rasterised version of the image so the re­sults can be thought of as providing a series of step changes in colour values rather than a continuous variation in those values. 
In this paper we show how to resolve this problem. As the contours can be thought of as a model of the image they need to be converted to a sampled image format in order to be seen on raster display devices. Thus a rendering process, entirely analogous to ren­dering processes used in 3D graphics, is required. The problem here is, if flat-fill is insufficient, how do we determine the intermediate pixel values between contours when rendering back to the sampled form? 
(...)
A major problem in determining this vector form is that of determining how many contours to use. A na ̈ıve approach would be to use one contour for ev­ery unit of colour quantisation but this not only pro­duces far more contours than are needed for a visually faithful reproduction of the image but also far more detail in defining each contour than is needed. If flat fill is used within contour boundaries the inefficient na ̈ıve approach is the only technique which will as­ sure an artefact-free result. Techniques based on mor­phological principles (e.g. [Ser82]) do this and, while we reference these techniques as part of the historical record, we would like to draw a distinction between the morphological approach and ours, notably in terms of the number of levels required for a visually satisfactory rendering. In such an approach all that would be needed for a visually faithful rendering would be to fill the contour with an ‘average’ colour quantised to be the border colour. In fact far fewer contours are needed in practice as we will show here.
(...)
To illustrate the con­tours without too much visual confusion we chose the out-of-focus image (...) ""

As the paper illustrates, this technique has the unique ability to slow our march toward ultra high resolution capture.  The resolution could be expanded infinitely in post with little or no effect on the image.  Sensors would instead be able to be designed with photosite size in mind.  Have you seen that new astronomy sensor from Canon?!?!  It demonstrates the best reason to have fewer photo sites that are larger.

Furthermore, that march toward ultra resolution could also be repurposed to aid in light field capture instead.  Currently, Lytro technology's appeal is limited largely by the format's inherently low resolution.  In light field phtography, the fields are captured simultaneously by neighboring pixels on the same sensor.  The focusing is left to algorithms in post, which selectively skip certain pixels in order to show a specific field.  

High Frame Rate: 

I have to say, having seen The Hobbit recently in 48 fps 3D, I was horrified by the look.  To me, it felt like a re-enactment on the history channel rather than a cinematic experience.  Their implementation of 3D hurt my brain/eyes in HFR.  I used to be a vocal proponent of Maxivision 35, but having seen this, I was horrified.  I know I am not alone in this opinion.
I do, however, imagine that someday HFR will somehow work.  Maybe it was the alternating images that made it painful.  Maybe once 3D is presented in holographic projection, it won't feel so odd.  Why did it seem like the Red Epic had FAR less dynamic range than I have sene in my own shooting experience?  There were parts of the movie where it worked.  The scene with Gollum in his cave lair seemed to work well.  But, the opening shots of Bilbo in his house looked clipped and strange.  Tight shots looked overcranked and jump cuts became GLARING.

Biomimicry eventually wins out... I just can't imagine how after seeing that.  Perhaps we'll revisit this someday when virtual reality becomes the norm for movies.  Will that ever happen? You tell me.
________________

Since the benefits are debatable, the most controversial idea (and the only one that I haven't heard mentioned by others) will certainly be...

Concave Sensors:

My visions of cinema's future often rely heavily on an ever more apparent reliance on biomimicry (a popular device in modern engineering).  A healthy does of biomimicry informs the question, ""Why are our sensors flat while the human eye is curved?""  Can we benefit from using our own eyes as the basis of a future optical system?  
I think, while we're trying to evolve cinema systems, it's at least a question worth asking before we get so far entrenched in the currently accepted standards that it becomes impossible to change.

I admit, I'm not nearly knowledgable enough to really speak at length about this, but I've heard that most of the vignetting that we see on CMOS sensors comes from the depth of the pixel well.  Some say that this depth adversely effects the outer edge of the sensor because light hits those ""wells"" at a steeper angle.  This is not to mention post-production lens compensation from lens maps, backside-illuminated sensor technology, and on-sensor micro-lensing, which take a more backwards-compatible approach to solving this problem.

Why not solve this problem by killing two (or many) birds with one stone instead?  Why not (instead of making the back element of a lens optimized for a flat sensor) tailor it toward a curved one?  If I'm not mistaken (optics experts feel free to chime in here) the back element of a lens has to do much (or all) of the compensation for a square imager.  If we could compare a lens designed for a flat imager with the exact same lens designed for a concave imager, which would exhibit less unwanted effects?  I'm guessing it would be the curved sensors, but again, I am by no means an expert and I post this mostly to hear my thoughts challenged.

I believe that, with a concave design, the back element of the lens would be able to follow the same contour of the sensor, introducing far less distortion and falloff.  I understand that such a sensor would be a bold move and it would have the unfortunate side effect of leaving behind hundreds of years of lenses.  But, would we gain more than we lost?  You tell me.  I've never heard anyone talk about this.  I come to this idea from the observation that wide angle lenses look absolutely stunning when they are used on a short flange focal depth, full frame camera system such as the Leica M series.  This observation (as many have told me) probably just stems from good optical deisgn on Leica's part and it is actually HARDER to get wide angle lenses to behave properly when the back element is so close to the image plane.  How else can you explain the huge FFD of Panavision and even PL lenses (which look absolutely stunning at all sizes)?

I talked at some length with Matt Duclos about this recently and he says (which many/most optics experts agree with) that a shorter flange focal depth makes optical design harder and introduces many problems since the back element needs to do more unsqueezing to get to the edges of the sensor.

Still, I can't help but think that less distance from the back element to the imager is better since light exponentially falls off as distance increases.  Perhaps a curved imager would allow us to have our cake and eat it too in that regard.


Final thoughts:
I know it's sort of unhealthy to obsess over emerging technologies.  But, I find that whether we want it or not, our medium is moving toward a world where everything but the human element of the performance can and will be manipulated...and I (empowered by the technological courage of Bill Pope on the Matrix, Mauro Fiore on Avatar, and Claudio Miranda on Life of Pi) don't intend to watch myself become irrelevant.  With the spirit of versatility in my heart, I try to embrace new ideas and look at them as tools in an ever-expanding arsenal designed solely to help a director create his/her vision.  After all, we can always decide not to use those tools just as easily as we can decide TO use them.  It's all a matter of what the project/shot calls for, in my opinion.
 
Are there any that I've forgotten that you're seeing?  Global sensor technology seems to be one that we desperately need but I can't imagine how it will be perfected as it is in film/Aaton's new camera.

This is my first time ever working with RAW video, just as a quick heads up. I LOVE the amount of flexibility you have in post with these clips, although at this current state I noticed a lot of artifacting and digital noise in the footage, although the ISO in all of these shots was set to 160.

All in all, it's an exciting step in the right direction, but it certainly has a ways to go. The ML team never cease to amaze, I never thought I'd be shooting raw video on this camera.

I'm gaffing a student short and we are using an ARRISUN 4K HMI par on an American Roadrunner hydraulic crank stand for a moonlight key.  I am debating how to approach diffusion.  I could use a 6x frame and throw in some muslin or other diff, or I could use a small Chimera Quartz Lightbank softbox.  The DP is worried that the Chimera will cost us too much light, but having never used one on a unit this powerful I'm not sure that it'll cost any more than Lee 216 or bouncing off of white griff.  I was going to throw a 1/4 Lee CTO on the par as well to warm it up, which may cost additional light.  We are shooting Red One MX and are trying to keep the ISO as low as possible to reduce blue channel noise. Thoughts?

I come from a video background, the land of zebra stripes, 70% skin tone and waveform monitors, but I'm working on learning filmic methods including the zone system.

I've only begun exploring it (and my copy of ""The Negative"" is still in the mail), but my question has to do with the fact that the system seems to pre-suppose that you have 11 stops of dynamic range at your disposal (or 9 if you don't count pure white and pure black). 

So my question is how do you adapt the system when working with cameras with reduced dynamic ranges? 

Do you always use zone 5 for neutral grey, zone 6 (+1 stop) for caucasion skin, zone 3 (-2 stops) for the darkest object with full detail, zone 7 (+2 stops) for the brightest object with full detail, and just chop off the top and bottom of the scale? Accepting that you will have less detail in the highlights and shadows?

Or do you adjust the number of stops between zones, perhaps to 3/4 of a stop instead of a full stop? So our caucasian skin becomes (+3/4 stops), dark objects in zone 3 become (-1 1/2 stops), and bright objects in zone 7 become (+1 1/2 stops). 

In the second example, you could take the total dynamic range and divide it by 11 to find the number of stops between zones, correct? So maybe it isn't 3/4 stops, but 2/3 stops or 1/2.

Or do you use another method I haven't mentioned? 

Thanks in advance, r/cinematography.",,False,self,t5_2ri38,False,,,True,t3_1bwc2d,http://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/1bwc2d/using_the_zone_system_with_cameras_of_varying/,

Recently I've become really fascinated with cinematography.  It started earlier in September, a friend and I were discussing what we wanted to be out of high school, He knew I was interested in something like Urban Planning, but I didn't know anything about his thoughts.  He was the smartest person I know that's my age, and all he threw at me was ""A camera-man"".  

I said something a long the lines of ""that's cool"".  Here my friend was, wasting his crazy intellect to press the record button on a camera.  I was wrong.  A few days after our discussion I re-watched Fight Club and The Shawshank Redemption, I remembered what my friend had told me, and decided to try and watch the two movies through the eyes of ""The Camera-Man"".  I noticed things about movies I never payed attention to: Line delivery, facial expression, angles, lighting, sound quality, everything.  It was incredibly satisfying.  

After watching those two movies again at the beginning of October, I started researching cinematography during my spare periods like mad.  Last night I went to see Skyfall with some friends because I was able to get some pre-screening tickets so that we could go to a screening a few hours before the real release.  There's a shot in the movie where you watch the scene played out through the side mirror of a car.  It was all the inspiration I needed.  It was amazing, who the fuck would have thought of doing something like that I wondered.  It dawned on me.  The cinematographer probably did it.  

So here I am, I'm only 15 so I don't want to focus on a single career just yet, but even if I don't pursue it as a career I'd like to try fiddling with it as a hobby.  I have no experience making movies, and the only photography I've done is for family vacations.  I'm asking for all the direction I can get.  What kind of camera should I be looking at?  Editing software?  *What do i even take videos of?* 

TL;DR 15 years old, obviously on a budget as I only make 120 bucks a month with a job I have at school controlling the sound board.  I want to shooting videos as a hobby, camera suggestions?  Editing software? What do I even take videos of?

I have recently completed a big idea/small movie script that I intend to shoot in Maine/New England, hopefully before the leaves fall. I am looking for a cinematographer willing to work on the cheap. We will be shooting digital, most likely 5D Mark II, unless the DP comes with a camera or we decide another camera would be better and I am able to rent one. 

The film is an odd love story about disconnected people coming together; a hypersensitive girl and a man who is losing the ability to feel any emotion due to a brain disorder. It has some things in common with Upstream Color, but is much, MUCH more straight forward. 

This will be a small shoot. The cast is limited, it's primarily a two person story, and a lot of it takes place outside in the evening, and in apartments. There are no large set pieces, I don't require any ridiculously complicated dolly shots, but experience with a steadicam or DIY cranes would be wonderful.

Need advice.",statusquowarrior,9,1,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/1i26x6/i_decided_to_buy_the_rokinon_cine_lenses_but/,"So, a friend of mine is going to the US in the end of the year, and we're saving like mofo's to buy gear for our future productions.

What we have: a Sony VG-30 with [this lens](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/913563-REG/sony_selp_18200_18_200mm_f_3_5_6_3_pz_oss.html).

It is a pretty good lens but we want bigger apertures(don't we all?). We have no lighting gear so having bigger apertures always helps.

We decided on buying the Rokinon Cine lenses, which seem to have a great value for the money. My broke ass budget is going to be MAX $1000 dollars, if I can save that, and my budget is going to go straight into buying a Sony NEX-7n as a B cam.

His budget is going to be around 2k dollars.

We also decided to buy our camera gear Sony all the way, so the next ""step up"" would be a fs100, fs700, etc. This if we don't have to rent gear, of course.

We're trying to get the most out of this trip, since import, trade and other taxes make these things cost an absolute ridiculous price where I live(a Macbook Pro Retina is the equivalent to $5k dollars). And there aren't even places that sell those Rokinon lenses.

So we were thinking in getting the **14mm, 85 and the 35**. All for Sony E Mount. He wants really bad the 8mm, but I don't see how we are going to use it so often, specially because of the distortion, that I need to say bugs the hell out of me.

Reminding you all that the camera is an APS-C camera so all of these *1.6 . The 8mm covers APS-C only so it vignettes on a full frame.

We are starting doing work mainly on ye' old regular stuff: corporate, indie filmmaking, mini doc style, music videos, etc.

The rest of the money is going to be spent on stuff like audio(probably a Senheiser ntg-2, a cheap pole and an external recorded-yet do decide), extra SD cards, SD card cases, etc.

What do you think? Should we replace the 14mm with the 8mm? Or with the 24mm?

It's so much to decide as to not waste money my head is going to explode.

I've really appreciated a lot of the expertise I've found on this sub and thought I'd fish for some knowledge.

I'd consider myself to be a savvy photographer with a pretty good understanding of lighting (studio and event), and I'm trying to transition into cinematography. I have a halfway decent camera body (D7000 - cropped, bleh) and a good array of quality glass, but I have no running lights.

I'm being trusted to light and shoot a wide array of shorts for my production company. My buddy has a kit of x3 1000W Arri's (and a few sloppy filters, some foamcore for bounce, etc.), but that's all up at our studio 6 hours away. I'm looking to get my own lighting set-up for shooting both independently and in conjunction with his set-up.

The applications would be for (at most) a large studio space (approx. 2250 sq ft) down to just small room size.

What would you guys recommend to get started? Is a x3 Arri kit the way to go? It's what I'm most familiar with from random occasional shoots and my time in film school shooting 16mm, but maybe there's a more practical setup? (I know my friend purchased that kit almost exclusively because it was what we used back in college).

Any good suggestions as far as banks, filters, random critical accessories, dampeners, etc?

Sorry if this has been discussed before (couldn't find any appropriate threads). Thanks so much for the help!

So I'm looking for some camera advice for a low-budget music video. We've got a fair chunk for camera rental, but not enough (is there ever enough?) for what I'd like. My requirements are thus:

-1080p (at least)  
-60FPS abilities  
-Good DR for day time, outdoor's locations (city skyline stuff)  
-$1000 per day about (NYC), can be stretched a teensy bit if I'm smooth and seductive to the budget people (I am not smooth nor seductive). Not shooting for more than 3 days, so no weekly rate deals unfortunately :(

So I've been checking out the Canon 1DC (nice to have a low profile for travel), but the 60FPS looks like it's upscaled and muddy. Why you gotta do me like that, $12,000 dslr?

The BMCC is a fantastic image, and I love shooting to ProRes, but no higher frame rates makes it a no go. 

The Fs700 just strikes me so much as digital sony looking. Maybe I'm being way too picky for my situation and should just deal with it, but the image to me is very ""meh."" The super high fps are nice, though. 

The Red One-MX is a great camera. It's also a gigantic tank of a camera, and the post-workflow will be crunched in the short turn around dealing with the RAW. I love RAW, but it's a cost to take into account for post. It solves my FPS problems, but having only shot on the new REDs, I've read that slow motion shooting can be persnickety and one needs to really delve into the menu's to get it going correctly. 

So what do you guys think? The c300 can't do high frame rates (REALLY CANON?) but otherwise that's a nice image. Anything I'm overlooking? Older cams? I'd love to her what the community is thinking. Thanks so much for your input! 

EDIT: Thanks for all the help r/cinematography! After talking with everyone it seems like the Scarlet is going to be my go-to for a good 60FPS acquisition that's going to meet broadcast standards. I look forward to sharing the results down the line to get everyone's criticism!

First post to this sub-reddit. Been doing photography &amp; video stuff off and on for a bit over a year now. Learned tons with each project and still have lots to learn.

In this short we were trying to go for a Snatch / Reservoir Dogs feel. Some quirky, really opinionated dialogue that sort of distracts the viewer from what the characters happen to be doing in the first place. 

We only had one morning to shoot it so it's not as perfectly shot as I'd of liked (and audio is sketchy at times--we boomed an H4N on a monopod to try and get the dialogue while moving which is not the best solution haha).

I'd love to hear feedback/suggestions that I and my friends can work to make better shorts.

So I've figured out how to crop in in post production (13.1% crop on the top and bottom to create the needed letter boxes). But I want to see the crop lines before I shoot, so i know exactly my frame lines.

Now I am well aware that Canons crack Magic Lantern can do this for Canon users, But I am Nikon user and would like to create a method for us Nikonians to readily do this. 

I've looked into Nikon D7000 hacks, and they don't really exist...Or if they do, show me them, I'd love to check em out!

My plan of attack on this issue is to set up a gridded frame, capture that, locate the crop marks, and then measure accordingly where they should be on the plastic BM-11 LCD screen protector for the camera so i can visually see the crops while shooting. 

If anyone else has a different way of doing this, or better, let me know!

First, I am not a student and have been in the industry in a technical capacity for over 7 years now (I'm in my 30s) so I will try my best to respond to everybody.

I've tried researching this on Google but to no real avail. With the new Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera that I saw last week at NAB, with its Super16mm 16:9 HD sensor, if I was to get hold of some old 16mm anamorphic lenses, how, if at all, could I get this setup to work? I know when filming with the Alexa and 2x anamorphic lenses, you need the 4:3 sensor option. I'm struggling to translate this to S16mm (or is it exactly the same principles). Would I need to ""frame"" to a 4:3 aspect ratio (since I can't switch the sensor - it's permanently natively 16:9) and then crop and lose the resolution in post?

Any and all help and guidance would be greatly appreciated!

I'm an indie director who occasionally does a project, and most recently I did a music video for my brother's band. I had scheduled a DP to come out that day to film it for me, but he cancelled on me the morning of, and we already rented equipment and had the space to ourselves, so we couldn't reschedule.

So I had to operate the camera (something I'm not that comfortable doing). I filmed with a Panny HVX-200, and the only lighting we had was a 4x4 kinoflo, and a 4x2 kinoflo.

Check out the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnQBpYiMr2s

The whole thing came out a little grainy looking, and even in 1080p looks low quality, even though it was filmed in 1080/24p. Also, some of the shots just don't look anything like what I saw in the viewfinder. Some of the movement looks choppy, and altogether I don't feel like the quality is very good.

What do you guys think? Do you think it was the camera? Could this have been fixed in post? Did I miss any major lighting? 

We also used a desk lamp to do some minor lighting, but for the most part we used the 2x4 kino for lighting faces, the 4x4 for backside, and the desklamp to highlight some different stuff.

At some point in the near future I am going to be shooting a commercial as a portfolio piece.  

Here is some quick test footage that was shoot on my Canon 60D with no addition lights.

My initial thoughts are that at most I will need a fill/background light but not much beyond that.  Also, the sound is with the built in mic.  I am looking to get a shotgun mic for a shot where I am interviewing the store owner.

I am very new to camera work so any suggestions regarding settings, lighting, etc. would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Edit:  I will be using a tripod for the actual shoot.  I didn't here because it was just quick test footage.  I had but a short time to run in, get the test footage and go.

1348730259.0,0,self.cinematography,10jxug,DSLR Question: Canon T3i vs Nikon 3200,penisinthepeanutbttr,3,3,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/10jxug/dslr_question_canon_t3i_vs_nikon_3200/,"Okay so basically I've been using my moms D3100 for filming but the lack of shooting options was crippling. The ""jello"" distortion and the only fps available at 1080p being 24 was annoying and didnt give me much to work with. The D3100 has 2 lenses, an 18-55mm one and a 55-200 one. The video quality is awesome but again, the frame rate issues are suffocating.

So I saved my money and just bought a brand new Canon EOS Rebel T3i/600D with the 18-55mm kit lens. Everyone was telling me that the video quality was amazing and that Canon's were so much better than Nikons for video. I was sold on the 60fps and flip out screen so I found a great deal and bought it. When I got the camera, I played around with it for a little bit, mostly shooting indoor's at night (last night) and outside while it was cloudy (today). I  have to say, maybe im crazy, but it seems to me like the D3100's video quality is better than the Canon's. For starters, the T3i does not have Continuous AF, which is most likely THE most feature for a video camera. The colors on the T3i seem bland and desaturated while the D3100's colors are bright and vivid. I'm always amazed when I look at the footage I get from the D3100. 

So needless to say, I'm a little disappointed with the T3i and with myself for not doing the proper research. This is where I'm sort of debating getting a D3200 body instead. What should I do? Is it all in my head?

**TL;DR: Bought a T3i after using a D3100 for a while. Disappointed with T3i video quality. Don't know if I should trade it in for a D3200 body or not.**

Here are my Priorities and Dilemma's:

1) I already own two Nikon lenses: an 18-55mm and a 55-200mm

2) The D3200 has 6 more MP (18 vs 24) and would be cheaper to buy.

3)The quality of the D3100's video seems better than the T3i, so I can only assume the D3200's quality is also much better. But I am getting a feeling that I dont have the camera set up correctly or something.

4) The Nikon's Nikkor 18-55mm has a MUCH wider angle than the T3i's 18-55mm and it looks magnificent.

5) I feel there may be a few things in both camera's that I dont fully understand, that if I do pull the trigger and switch, I'm going to miss out on an awesome feature or something

6) The T3i lacks Continuous AF which is a MUST for the type of filming I do, but the D3200 lacks a fliip out screen which is also important for all of the low angles I do.

Maybe its because I havent shot the T3i in sunlight? I dont know, what should I do? 

EDIT: The T3i video quality is EXTREMELY noisey/grainy. I just took a test video between both cameras both at the same settings: Shutter speed 100, Aperture 5.6, ISO set at 3200 both at 1080p at 24 fps...the canon's came out dark and grainy while the D3100's was focused correctly and had nice exposure.",,False,self,t5_2ri38,1348731247.0,,,True,t3_10jxug,http://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/10jxug/dslr_question_canon_t3i_vs_nikon_3200/,

They both have a hard-lit look, the whites are blown out, and in general everything seems to be overlit with little real-life contrast. I presume this is to compensate for the low dynamic range of video.

In my opinion, everything just looks cheap and tacky. In turn, my willing suspension of disbelief seems to drop away for me: I notice all the things in the film that look staged in the *form*, which leads me to notice all the absurd moments much more in the *content*.

But furthermore, I can't put my finger on whether it's this ""video look"" that makes every notion of cinema seem as though it's being poorly used in an almost cynical manner, for the sake of it, or whether the films are just poorly executed. For example, take a look at [this shot from the *Safety Not Guaranteed* trailer](http://i.imgur.com/oImbe.jpg). The lighting just seems badly thought out. There's little contrast to the image, instead of softening the lights to make the scene look natural, they just seem to be decreasing the intensity, and the whole thing just seems sidelit for the sake of being sidelit.
