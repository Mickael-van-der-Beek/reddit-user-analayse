Say what you want about the controls. Say what you will. It's still in beta so while your concerns are noted, they're also likely to be addressed before the full game comes out.

That being said, I've never played an FPS more engaging to me than this. Offhandedly I decided to experiment with a suit design. I used the scout suit, since I chose 'Arbiter' and equipped it with a droplink, a stamina module, a hacking module, a bit of shields, and an SMG. I didn't really think it would work that well, considering how poorly I'd been doing up to that point, but I emerged surprised.

As the skirmish started I ran up to every hackable thing I could and captured it, giving my team a slight foothold in the process. I was the first to reach the cannon and captured it. I found a nice secluded spot to place my first droplink, whose existence would later help me to recapture this first cannon, and proceeded to capture the surrounding support structures. Moving toward the second cannon I saw an HMG-wielding heavy. I pinged him a few times and ran away, letting him follow me. Once he was deep enough into close quarters I ran away, heading toward the cannon I'd been trying to take the whole time. A few moments go by and I see one of my teammates has killed him, nice. I then head in and capture the second cannon, putting my team in the lead 2-to-1.

A bit of downtime goes by, I sneak a kill in with a teammate against an unfortunate logi. Then the shit seemed to hit the fan and the reds just filled the little encampment where the cannons were located. We got beat back pretty hard, but thankfully the droplink I'd placed earlier was letting my team get right back into the fight, versus having to run what I assumed was practically a mile from our initial spawn point. Somehow we fight off the red wave and it's just me and another fellow who just happened to be watching these two enemies walking towards us. My team mate draws their attention and I sneak over to a point where they won't see me until they enter the room we're in. As the first one enters, his shields are already stripped thanks to my teammate and it only takes a second for my SMG to finish him off. The second one proves to be a bit more annoying and takes cover. But through some unspoken order, my teammate and I flank him on both sides, trapping him and cutting off any escape he might have had. We close in and start filling him with holes, but he's a little tougher than the first one. Just as we're about to kill him he gets taken out by a friendly sniper who'd just happened to be watching the entire ordeal not too far away.

As the match ends, my team emerges victorious, made clearly so by the 56/0 kill-death ratio that our tank-wielding ally had, and low and behold my WP are the highest I've ever had them. I had 955 points with a 7/4 k/d, almost double my previous best, and this while using a suit I've never used before.

I've never had more fun on any other FPS, and given CCP's track record with Eve Online, I know it's only going to get better over time. I hope you guys are having at least half as much fun as I am, because I don't want this game to die.",,False,self,t5_2sh6s,False,,gallente,True,t3_17gbph,http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/17gbph/i_am_impressed/,

I decided to drop a few hundred aurum and the minimum amount of SP for some codewish tactical rifles to really see how they handle, putting them on a fully militia fit dren assault suit as to not waste money on the protosuits and fittings

I went into a FW fight, figuring that because my militia suit has zero hp compared to protosuits, i will die instantly and my theory that the protosuits are the issue, not the TARs, would be confirmed.

[**I was completely incorrect.**](http://i.imgur.com/xQxpN4g.jpg)

Every single enemy that i saw, regardless of thier suit size or tech level, were dropped in a matter of seconds, a large portion of these kills were on proto logistics and assaults.

I died occasionally when i was outnumbered or just playing badly, eventually ended up camped by a tank near a capture point, forcing me to both stay out of sight of the tank using the cover and to fight off the enemies trying to take the capture point. I thought to myself ""Drake you dashing stallion, this is now a complete CQC fight, the TAR cannot possibly stand up to enemies at these ranges""

**I was completely incorrect.**

The TAR has little to zero spread when firing, this means that it is actually easier to use close range hip-firing than it was at its intended ranges, enemies disappeared faster than before.

From my capture point the TAR could just hit people hacking another capture point, not for much damage but enough to force them to stop hacking or die.

Not only could I destroy people trying to take my capture point, i could simultaneously delay, or even kill, enemies hacking another capture point.

TL;DR: with only AR operation 3 and a full militia fit, standard grade suit, the TAR is by far the most powerful weapon at every range it can fire at.

This view changed over the weekend.  After my brother moved back home, his PS3 coming with him and after learning I can take my Mouse and Keyboard and plug them into the PS3 I decided to finally give it a go, give the game a fair and honest try and I have to say my couple of matches over the weekend blew me away.

Even with my experience with EVE I did still find the whole Skills + Market place a little confusing as to learning what is effective or not and which weapons may be better over others.  All the tools both in and out of EVE make things easier to plan although I presume similar tools could be made for Dust, I'm not 100% Sure though.

The game play itself was fully enjoyable although I'm finding myself with horrible K/D Ratio's so far, now although I'm not a pro FPS Player any other FPS I find myself with a positive K/D Ratio so I suppose It's just getting used to the game.

I look forward into putting more time into the game, I really want to get into piloting drop ships and feel it would be nice to have a training room to get used to the controls before I spend in game isk and losing them horribly to the enemy.  Two other features I would like to see is more types of aircraft, maybe a support/ecm ship that reduces the spotting range of troops/vehicles.  Another feature I would like to see is to include EVE players a little more in the sense that corporations can support their DUST Members by being there to drop in vehicles bought in EVE.

Overall? Loving the game and urge people not to ignore it just because it is out on PS3 rather than PC.",,False,self,t5_2sh6s,False,,,True,t3_1dc8sm,http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/1dc8sm/surprised_by_dust/,

I think that in a game like DUST, where SP, once invested, is ostensibly there forever, playing into such ""Flavor of the Month"" fits is just a really bad idea.  Sure, if you've got 15mil SP and can use all those fits anyway, switching between them worrying only about ISK expense, then do whatever the fuck you like - but don't go around encouraging the newbros to spec this way or that way.  Why?

To put it simply, *CCP changes the game every month*.  A short list of FOTM fits that were hit with the nerf hammer:

* Caldari Logistics used as Assault suits
* Laser Rifle
* Tactical Assault Rifle
* Flaylock Pistol

While none of these is individually a BAD choice to spec into, the suggestion to spec into them for a newb simply because ""omfg my K:D is crazy with the [FOTM Fit],"" is misleading - you're suggesting to them, hey, this is the best fit you can get right now, so as a newb you'll do best if you can get into it, but the reality is, that nerf hammer is JUST around the corner and you may have just sent a would be friendly newb into a massive disappointment.

I don't believe DUST is a game where people should spec for power; instead, they should spec for roles.

---

**What do you want to do?**  

* Do you want to be a sneaky assassin, off the radar, backstabbing and then running off into the scenery?

* Or maybe you want to be the logibro, throwing out reps and keeping your team stocked and updated.

* Or perhaps that minmatar logi suit is your go-to Point Hacker, equipped with hacking mods and remote explosives to capture and hold points more efficiently?

* Or maybe that Commando suit looks like the perfect AV choice - a plasma cannon AND an AR does seem like it'd be a fun playstyle.

* Or how about an assisting scout, who starts matches just to drop spawn points for the team until he can find a Supply Depot to get into a that heavier Gallente Medium frame you've been working on.

---

DUST isn't about playing towards the Flavor of the Month, it's about picking a good battlefield role that helps your team in a way that you enjoy.  This is why I've gimped myself in my weapon selection personally - I've elected to have the option to fill many different battlefield roles in a passable fashion as opposed to one role in a dominant fashion.  Whatever way you choose, don't base your choices on what everyone is screaming is the most powerful choice for you.


CCP updates their games, and they are absolutely balance minded - if you've specced into a crappy weapon or suit because you liked the flavor, well, just like the nerf hammer is destined for FOTM, so is the buff hammer headed for the Gimp of the Month.


**TL;DR - Don't listen to fools telling you that this fit or that fit is the ""way to go"" with regards to skills.  If you're telling people to go for powerful weapons, stop - you'll just set newbs up for disappointment and frustration when their favorite weapon gets nerfed.  CCP is concerned with balance, and they will balance the shit of your shit in time.**

1. Have an alternate role. Sniping doesn't always work out, sometimes you have a bad map, or too many snipers, or your team just needs you someplace else. Have at least one go to backup backup role that you can fill so-so at least.

2. You will run out of ammo. Get a fit with at least a compact nanohive as soon as you can. Coming out of position and all the way to a supply station then back into position hurts your effectiveness. For God's sake, dropping a nanohive shows up on everyone's radar, don't drop it right on top of your spot. 

3. Be prepared to switch priorities and position. Combat is a fluid situation. Even if you have a sweet spot, don't get married to it. 

4. The closer you are the faster you can deliver a hit. Seems like a no brainer, but if you aren't being effective, you need to find a new spot.

5. Crouch. You'll live longer, and your gun will be steadier.

6. Cover is nice but concealment is what you need. Cover will keep assault goons from ventilating you...for a second. Concealment is what keeps you from getting counter-sniped. 

7. It normally takes one head shot or two body shots to kill a target. We'll discuss when body-shots are a good idea later.

8. Your scout dropsuit offers very little protection, but it is difficult to pick up on radar. However that doesn't make you invisible. Moving, draws attention. 

Skirmish:

First Rule. You are part of a team. Your objectives are to take the Null Cannons. NOT Kill enemy toons. Your assault team will be doing the heavy lifting. You exist to serve their needs. Your role falls broadly into one of three areas.

1. Direct support fire. This means you fire on the enemy while they are engaged on your assault team. Body hits are OK. You are trying to make it hard for them to know when they are engaged and disengaged, where the fire is coming from, or where safe spots are, as well as weaken their armor/shields so they are easier for the assault team to kill.  Your priority of targets are 

Enemy Snipers. They will drop your guys and pin them down. Make them dead. 
Heavy Infantry (Try and shoot these guys in the head) They spearhead assaults. Killing them slows enemy advance.
Everyone else. 

There will be a lot of shooting going on if you are behind your guys, (e.g. the direction the enemy will be looking) don't be surprised by being spotted. Be ready with your backup plan to take cover and relocate.

2. Area control. Find a spot that allows you to control key areas and deny access to single targets. By key I mean null cannons. By areas I mean at least two of them unless you get one of those 3 null cannon levels. Don't let the enemy reclaim the null cannons you cover. 

3. You've got the scout suit which means you can move pretty much without showing up on enemy radar. Which means if you get an opportunity on an exposed enemy null cannon, you should counter-snipe the cover if it has one then convert it, then beat feet to an area control position while it transitions to your side. 

Remember. Team, if you are just off by yourself plinking the occasional enemy and you aren't covering a friendly null cannon OR providing direct fire support to your guys you are wrong. If the assault team isn't getting the job done because they are short handed it's time to put away the sniper rifle and help meet objectives. 

Ambush:
First Rule. You are part of a team. The goal here is to kill more enemy toons than the enemy kills your guys. You need to deliver with the killshots. 

Basic principals: 

Try not to get into a direct support role right behind your guys. It will make you dead more often.
Dead toons are worth a point, injured toons are worth nothing. Injuring with body shots without followup just wastes your limited ammo, gets you spotted then killed.
If you spot or encounter an enemy sniper, they make your guys dead, you need to make them dead. Don't pass up a counter-snipe. 
Remember your goal is to pile up the bodies without dying. Your spot selection should reflect this. If you can't find a spot that racks up kills, concentrate on counter-sniping and at least keep the snipers from offing your guys. If you aren't dropping opposition, and you aren't being effective counter-sniping, time to explore that alternate role again. 

Sniping is a dynamic thinking role, in order to do it correctly and effectively you need to adapt your approach to the map, your enemy, and your team and the battle as it unfolds. If you think it is just about sitting back in the hills and shooting convenient targets you are doing it wrong.

TL;DR: Every skill rank benefits the pilot in EVE, but some skills in DUST 514 offer no benefit to the soldier.

I remember every skill in EVE benefiting the player. If a skill didn't provide an outright bonus, items still applied bonuses based on its skill level. There was always a benefit in training a skill beyond its prerequisite.

You may only need to train *Amarr Battleship I (and other prerequisites)* to pilot the Armageddon, but the Armageddon continues to get better all the way to *Amarr Battleship V* because of the item's Skill Bonus.

Every level of a skill is useful.

However, in DUST 514, there are skills where two out of five ranks — hundreds of thousands of skill points — do nothing but get you one step closer to the *next* level, where the skill finally unlocks a new tier of items.

*[Racial] [Size] Dropsuits* skills are the ones most of us encounter first: ""Unlocks access to standard dropsuits at lvl.1; advanced at lvl.3; prototype at lvl.5."" The *Dropsuit Core Upgrades* for equipment items also have this problem. Ranks 2 and 4 are just buffers between you and the next tier of equipment, offering no incentive of their own. You have no reason to train them until you know you plan to train the next level of skill immediately afterwards.

Skills like *Armor Repair Systems* don't have this problem. ""Unlocks access to armor repairer dropsuit modules. +5% to armor repair module efficacy per level."" Yes, they unlock new tiers of equipment at their odd levels, but they continue to grant bonuses improving those modules in the even levels. They also make a Militia module with 5 levels of skill more powerful than that same module with no training.

This, to me, seems like a design problem. I feel like some skill levels are just a waste of SP, since they offer no benefit. I'm hoping for a little feedback from other players before collecting as much information as I can and formatting it all pretty to post on the forums or spam the shit out of the Dev's to bring it to their attention.",,False,self,t5_2sh6s,False,,,True,t3_1imsua,http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/1imsua/eve_dust_514_and_padding_skills/,

Im creating a new topic on it specifically to bring it out in the open, but the original post after someone asked for help is here:*     
http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/17gi1g/heavy_machine_gun_has_no_spool_up_time/c85ne5b

Heavies have a few exploitable weaknesses but first you have to know their strengths.  They have lots of health and access to the heavy weapon slot.

The health lets them stay around in a fight a lot longer but can also be a major downfall.  Heavies get cocky, we think we are invincible, and we will wander out of cover into the open and overextend ourselves into a kill box when we are on the attack. 

Second, the heavy weapon slot grants access to two weapons at the moment, the forge gun (if you get hit with one of these its to the re spawn vats with you) and the HMG (which seems to be the sore point).  The HMG is a monster up close, and will shred infantry out in the open without breaking a sweat.

**Range**     
Stats you need to know:     
Assault Rifle     
Max Range: 78m     
Optimal Range: 1 - 35m     

Heavy Machine Gun      
Max Range: 59m     
Optimal Range: 1 - 34m     
Meta Level: 1      

Now, the Optimal Ranges of both weapons are close, but the assault rifle can hurt the heavy from ranges where the heavy cant shoot back.

You need to know this, and the ranges specifically because you cant try and trade hits from the heavy even at your optimal range.  Its a terrible idea and it wont work out very well for you.   One easy way to kill heavies is to stick 50m+ out away from them and peg them till they fall.  Your rifle retains amazing accuracy at that range, where the HMGs spread really hurts us.  You will bring us down at extreme range before we bring you down/move into range.

**Cover**      
Now that the above  isnt always an option.  the next best thing is cover.  You guys with the AR's may not notice this much, but unless you are hip firing you probably noticed that unless you can only see their head or they are completely crouched behind cover, you generally dont care.  Even with L1 in AR Operation you can wield a militia assault rifle accurately enough to reliably hit almost all your shots into 1/4 of an exposed body.  Cover doesnt hurt you when you shoot much.  And so most of you think it wont help you either.

That circle the heavy has, shots go -everywhere- in that circle.  If we get the circle so its only on you, you are dead.  however if part of that circle is obscured (even by half) it limits our dps by HALF.  Keep half your torso behind a wall, stand behind a barricade.  Do ANYTHING besides let us see your whole body.  Iv been killed countless times by a guy wielding an AR trading hits with me simply because half my shots or more hit the cover instead of him.

**War of Attrition**     
We have lots of health.  But the MK1 heavies a lot of people still use armour tank with 700-800 HP.   their shields only have 100 HP, and they dont recharge often, and armour repairs come back slowly.

A common tactic people use to bring down heavies is to pop out and take out their shields and a bit of armour, then go back into hiding to let their shields regen from the return fire.

This has two effects.  The heavies armour will slowly get lower and lower making them panic, and in the brief moment where your accuracy is at its best his is at its worst and you can damage his armour again (once your shields are back up) and he can only damage your shields before you run away and repeat.

Its a slow process, but the heavy runs as fast as you walk.  you control where the engagement happens.  So dont make it happen on his terms.

**Grenades**       
Remember that comment of heavies running as fast as you walk?  Grenades are hell for them.

**Scout suits+shotties**
Heavies have a poor turn speed, its even slower when we are shooting.  The Scout suits are the best to capitalize on this, but assaults can do it too.  Dont run right at us, sneak around us, get into our blind spot and punish us.   Its rock paper scissors.  Scouts are the bane of heavies, heavies are the bane of AR/assault suits, and it sounds as if AR/assault have little problem handling the Scouts.   If a scout gets to a heavy (which isnt very hard) the fight is basically over right there.

**Speed**     
within a range 0-15 or 0-20 meters you are dead if a heavy gets a bead on you.  But we cant turn very fast, not nearly as fast as you can run across our screen, dont run at us, dont stop moving, if you are in a heavies kill zone get out of the kill zone.  At that range an assault suit can run fast enough that the heavy will have a lot of trouble keeping a bead on you.  You might not kill the heavy if you have to run like this, but its better than giving him a free kill.

**Spool up**     
We get more accurate as we keep firing, and we can keep firing for a while.  Our guns will overheat before long if we keep doing it however.  So we have a choice, if we want to hold maximum accuracy with minimum spread we need to hold down the trigger.

This is deadly for you.  How do you avoid it?  Dont give us a target long enough.  This was mentioned in the war of attrition but it deserves its own point.  If we keep firing when we cant see you we retain accuracy but waste ammo and risk overheating.  If we stop firing then we are less accurate when you pop back out.  Just dont pop out for long.

**Snipers:**     
Snipers in a 1v1 scenario have the advantage of range over everyone.  However without support unless the heavy is stuck completely out in the open or has to cross a large stretch of land snipers should look for other targets unless they have a friend or ally nearby who can take advantage of a temporarily wounded heavy.

The Mark I Heavy suit can soak a snipers shot with their shields without really caring.

The Mark II Heavy Suit takes 2 shots to drop their shields, and then another 3 to kill them with a standard rifle.  Frequently if there is no combat to be happening within the next 10-15 seconds ill just walk out in a MK II Heavy suit and stand there (or spin, or jump) to draw sniper fire/check to see if there *is* a sniper and duck away into cover after the second hit finishes off my shields.  It wastes the time of the sniper, draws their focus, and possibly wastes ammo if they dont have a nano-hive.

Given a Mark I suit cant do that as well (100 vs 300 shield), and it may actually be worth the snipers time to rip off chunks of armor.  But otherwise unless the heavy has no way of breaking LOS with you or you have a friend close enough to capitalize on the situation (as most heavies run an armour rep anyway, and watch the minimap for friendlies), id find a better target than a full health Heavy.  (my second favorite fitting is a sniper fit)

**Conclusion:** This is for solo use, ideally you will have friends nearby to help deal with a heavy.  In which case you use squad level tactics.  The heavy suit is a commanding presence on the battlefield, but its really easy to overwhelm with even 2 people.  It has no 'oh hell iv gotta run away now' mode when it hits the fan and it has no way to reach another engagement quickly (except for the LAV spam, but that takes time too, its hard to control, and they are easy to kill unless your entire team is completely ignoring anti-tank (even a meta 1 HMG will shred a standard LAV)).  Abuse the heavies weaknesses, and for the love of god dont let them play their strengths.

If anyone has any other advice or additions I would welcome them!  (I would also personally welcome advice as a heavy on how to deal with scouts/shotties)  How do you deal with a Heavy? as a Heavy what tends to kill you or get you killed?

**Editors Note:** Iv killed Heavies (or escaped them) in the ways mentioned using non heavy suits as well have been on the receiving end of them when I run Heavy.  I primarily use Heavy suits and that is where my skills are tied up, but even the stock militia fits with no real specialization is more than enough to pull this (at least the points relevant to an AR/assault suit) stuff off.     
**Note::** Someone else made another topic similar to this but with a less specific point as I was re-posting this one.  Im sorry I didnt see It before I posted, but hopefully discussion can still happen here.

That's EVE for any new player. The massive universe is just a huge smack in the brain at first glance. Like its mother, EVE, DUST 514 does exactly that. You're given EVE's Civilian-esque ""Militia"" modules and Dropsuits, told to duke it out in Skirmish fights or Ambush fights and you learn from there. 
The starter suits not very powerful at all. In fact, when I tried to use it, I felt like I was piloting an Ibis and attempting to kill a Cynnabal that has other Cynnabal buddies to back. 
The very first match, a Skirmish match, I was struggling to figure out what I wanted to do i DUST, be it a Medic or Assault class, or both. The controls are not what I would expect on a PS3 controller either, so no matter what weapon I chose, I couldn't hit a damn thing, and when I did, It did diddly squat.
The game, although it's in beta phase, does not stand to compare to anything else I've seen recently being run on the Unreal Engine 3. I was expecting to see a beautiful EVE universe similar to the one I play nightly on the PC. I was sorely disappointed.

So, after all that disappointment, I started to learn. I skilled up some skills, acquired non Militia modules and fine tuned the sensitivity on the aiming.

That's better. I decided that Skirmishes were far too large of a map, and far too long of a round to actually get anywhere learning the game. Once I felt I had a better Dropsuit fit, I queued up for an Ambush. This is nice. A Small map, fast respawn, instant action. Great! I'm learning now. I'm getting better, I'm getting at least 5-6 kill streaks now that I know not to use ADS too much.

This game is mirroring EVE far to beautifully. It starts out broken, beat and scarred and becomes something where the memory remains.

TL;DR: Big learning curve, holy shit this is hard, ok I figured out how to play. Graphics suck. Its a beta.",,False,self,t5_2sh6s,False,,,True,t3_176nyb,http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/176nyb/i_just_started_playing_tonight_long_time_eve/,

1375811291.0,24,self.dust514,1jtp4m,Newbro to Newpro: Demystifying the Newbie Experience,bladesire,25,1,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/1jtp4m/newbro_to_newpro_demystifying_the_newbie/,"So, you're new to DUST, but you love shooters, and you think DUST sounds like it could be fun.  You download, install, hit the character creation screen, fumble around with the choices, and then find yourself in your Merc Quarters.  If you know how to upgrade skills and change fittings, you're prepared for the advice herein.  

Lots of people have issues with pubby matches - if you've been on this subreddit for even just a little while, you've heard the complaints about high-SP vets stomping newbies left and right, about how your gun just won't shoot as far or hit as hard, and you think to yourself, ""Well, fuck.  I might as well just shut the game off until I've caught up.""

I'm here to stop you from getting to that point.  There are a few things to understand about DUST before we proceed:


* DUST is for the patient.  You can play as much as you like, but aside from boosters and special events, you're pretty much capped to a set amount of SP per month.  You won't get more perks from playing more (beyond the SP cap) - only more ISK to spend on the suits you're losing.  

* DUST is constantly changing.  As an MMOFPS, and a fresh one at that, the updates keep on rolling in.  They're trying to put out one per month, and a couple expansions per year to boot.  The game you play now will be different from the one you play in the future, even if only a month into that future.  If you like one weapon, one suit, one fitting setup, be prepared for it to be altered by an upcoming patch - it's not guaranteed for every item, but you can rest assured that anything that seems too good to be true probably is and will be nerfed.  

* DUST is complicated.  The skill and fitting system in DUST does not lend itself to being easily comprehended - though the basics are simple enough, truly understanding how each module works with each other module and how all of those come together to make a suit function is a task for an advanced player.  You'll need to be ready to experiment to figure this stuff out, so a good dose of curiosity is extremely helpful.


When you come online, you'll see a lot of guides, videos and posts shouting about ridiculous fits or OP weapons.  It's overwhelming.  How do you know who to listen to?

---

Before you do ANYTHING, you need to take a deep breath and just STOP.  The following advice is to prepare you for making those irreversible SP spending decisions:

1)  SP are plentiful, but not so plentiful as to allow you to spec straight into protogear and live a carefree existence of ultimate pwnge.  If you spec all the way into one role, you're stuck there until the SP accrues again.  Just make sure that the role you're speccing into is one you actually want; I recommend testing the waters with only 1 or 2 skill levels of advancement into any suit or weapon you're unsure of (though even this can be considered ""wasted"" to some extent - so choose wisely!)

2)  Use Militia versions of items.  Some items still don't have these versions, but when there's a militia version, it doesn't require any Skills to use and will let you get a feel for how the weapon or module functions. 

3)  If a fit doesn't work too well, consider the following:  Who killed you, and what were they fit with?  How does swapping mod X for mod Y affect the dropsuit fitting?  Does this particular fit promote a certain playstyle (i.e. low overall HP but high recharge values might indicate a skirmish fit, not intended to be out in the open for long periods, but instead ducking behind cover consistently to recharge).

4)  The Assault Rifle is universal - if you're having a bad time with your current fit, then a run-of-the-mill assault suit, equipped similarly to the assault kits from other FPS titles, is an easy role to fall back on.  Skill into the Assault Rifle as soon as possible, and put a decent amount of SP in it - it will provide you the wiggle room to experiment without gimping you in every match you play.

5)  **THE MOST IMPORTANT ADVICE I COULD EVER GIVE ANYONE**:  Be a social butterfly.  Get a mic, join squads, ask for help.  The people playing this game are pretty chill, and generally amicable, not to mention the only way you really get to see someone's whole fit is if they tell you.  Talking with other players will give you a feel for what fits work best when, and why they work like they do.  If you're not an asshole you'll get channel invites and possible corp opportunities.  If you game with the same people over and over, you're likely to develop a rhythm, and DUST, like EVE, is intended to be a social experience.

If you keep these things in mind, I think you can mold your experience with DUST into exactly what you want it to be, even despite its current shortcomings.  These things won't make you good at DUST, but I do think they'll help prevent you from falling into the trap that so many new players do, causing them to rage and bounce.  These tips will make you into the NewPro you were meant to be - still under-skilled and under-informed, but with the foundation to begin making the best of this great shooter.

In closing, I would go further to say that if you have played DUST and come to this thread looking for advice only to believe that the steps I've suggested are ""too much"" or ""not worth it"" for you, you may want to look into another game.  DUST is like EVE in this way, I think, and it will not be for everyone.

**TL;DR - Don't spend your SP too soon, use Militia gear, evaluate new fits after each use, spec AR at least a little, join squads and make e-friends.**

Squad Orders

* Attack: 20% Bonus to War Point gain within proximity of order.
* Defend: 20% Bonus to War Point gain within proximity of order.
* Capture: 20% Bonus to War Point gain within proximity of order.

* Whenever I am squadleader, I put the Defend objective on one of my squadmates.

Values listed are gained by Squad Members preforming actions withing the radius of the order.
The Squad Leader gains bonus War Points equal to the bonuses earned by the squad.


Issuing Orders (As Squad Leader) Method 1:

* R2: Opens weapon swap wheel
* R3 (while in weapon swap): Opens squad order selection wheel
* R1: To assign selected order to current target


Method 2:

* Down Directional Pad: Opens Overview Map, X on target under rectal: Opens order selection wheel, highlight desired order to assign.



Precision Strike:

* Right Directional Pad: Opens a context menu
Middle Menu option: Opens PS selection menu.
X opens overview map to select target.

* Switching suits at supply depots is a golden tactic when used right. The value of a supply depot to me is way higher than it was to begin with alright. The naming is also really helpful as of to create priorities among the suits.

* I have been experimenting with Demolitions II as it gives access to proximity mines and I've already killed a few tanks using em. Whenever I am near a supply depot I always pick my proximity class and place out 6 mines then switch back. My ""anti vehicle"" fitting is now a logibro fitted with proximity mines, remote explosives, swarm launcher and AV grenades.

* And when using the Swarm Launcher after getting a lock...fire straight up in the air instead of forward and you might get the rockets to pass over a hill, or even over a wall.

* If you have nothing to do with your strike, wait for the enemy to call in a vehicle and drop it on top of the RDV as it slows down to deliver the vehicle. You'll get 150 WP for blowing up the RDV +the vehicle it was transporting + whoever called in the vehicle.

* Restock your nanohives every time that you are near a supply depot. All that you have to do is select the same suit that you are in. You don't have to switch to another suit and then switch again. You can just select the same suit that you are in and everything will be replenished.

* Hacked Supply Depots will repair a vehicle's armor (not shields) if you pull up alongside it. Maybe now all you guys will stop destroying them.

* You can play your own music. During the game press the PS button and go to your music files, press the number you want to play, listen to your own stuff while playing.

* Move back and fourth and strafe when capping.

* Another thing about the supply depot is if you switch between two completely different suits (say logi &amp; heavy or even type 1 &amp; 2 of the same class) it'll give you full health.

In typical MMO's you just walk, or fly in a taxi of some sort (WoW griffins and wind riders) but i just can't picture it like that in Dust. The only thing i can think of is your typical room based online like most other First Person Shooters, find a match (contract) with room for more players in a list of other matches and just hit join. In this case its not really an MMO is it? aside from each game being linked together in a persistent world.

On the other hand a single planet could have multiple bases owned by different corporations and teams would try and take over bases on that planet, but how would interplanetary battle work when a whole planet is owned by one corp?

You can see it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/nw7no/im_a_guy_that_knows_almost_all_there_is_told_to/)

But a lot has been revealed since then, so I think it's time to do another one! So hit me with what ever questions you have about DUST 514 and I'll do my best to answer them. But before you start reading, i recommend you read both the FAQ [here](http://www.dust514.org/home/item/dust-514-faq-getting-to-know-the-basics) and the First Steps article [here](http://www.dust514.org/home/item/your-first-steps-in-dust-514)

If you have a cool game idea/feature/anything else that you would to see in DUST 514, make sure your voice is heard. Yes the developers are really listening to us. The best place as always is to post on the EVE Online forums. Of course if you don't play EVE Online, the next two best places are on the forums at www.dust514.org or to tweet to the developers themselves. Some good ones to tweet to (and follow) are:

* [CCP CmdrWang](https://twitter.com/#!/CCP_CmdrWang) (DUST 514 community manager)
* [CCP Jian](https://twitter.com/#!/CCP_Jian) (Executive producer)
* [CCP Praetorian](https://twitter.com/#!/CCP_Praetorian) (Creative Director)
* [CCP Nullarbor](https://twitter.com/#!/CCP_Nullarbor) (Programmer)
* [CCP Nothin](https://twitter.com/#!/tuplanegatiivi) (Game Designer and economy guy. a.k.a Eino)
* [CCP Hellmar](https://twitter.com/#!/HilmarVeigar) (CEO of CCP, more commonly known as Hilmar)

Don't worry about the age of this post if you want to ask questions. So long as it's a top level comment and it hasn't been asked yet, I'll answer it in two years if you're still asking.

As always, make sure you keep your [Magic Crystal Ball](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=28840) with you at all times. Anything and everything can change. Please also remember that I am not CCP.

Finally, don't ask for any beta keys. I'm not giving them away right now so asking won't help. Neither will offers of money or other  ""services"". Seriously, don't even bother. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

Now my thoughts have changed. Most huge issues that I thought needed to be immediately addressed, were addressed. The nanite injectors were fixed, instantly making my job much easier as a medic and pretty much guarantee an extra 300 war points for me. They're updating the interface and UI which I definitely thought was an issue that needed to be addressed, fixing latency and stability issues along with finally repairing the broken vehicle physics.

These are just a few off of the top of my head, but if CCP really is releasing a patch like this every month, by the time the PS4 drops, this will be a truly great game. The biggest issues are the balance, I love the way the game plays and I like the fact that it involves time investment and skill. If this game continues to add depth and variety (I'm sure everyone saw the models for all the new racial fits and weapons that they're adding in so we don't have the same damn weapon model with different stats or colors) it will be a game very similar to EVE in terms of depth on a FPS level.

What are the common expectations for the game at this point? It was awful at beta, sub-par at release, now it is *ok*. Does anyone expect this to be a stellar game like me at release on the PS4? Once the issues are fixed (this patch pretty much focused on just that), all this game needs is more depth and CCP has seemed to really respond to our complaints with this patch. If this game can utilize and further the connection with EVE (easier communication between the two, more depth in alliances and even more content with planetary conquest) I'm thinking this game could be really good.

If this game survives, it will survive for a *long time*. If it doesn't survive, welp, it's just wasted potential. I surprisingly have more faith in CCP than I originally did.

EDIT2: I thought of some things I want to test in relation to this bug, but I won't be able to test them all myself. I'll do as many as I can as soon as I get the time, but if other people could help out and share the results, that would be great.

1. Test this bug in vehicles.   
2. Time stuff and see if you truly are going twice as fast.   
3. Try it with more than one keyboard. (It would be crazy if your speed was directly proportional to the number of keyboard you were using.) *I won't be able to try this as I only own one keyboard.
4. If someone can figure out how to get two controllers as the same player, try it like that.
  
EDIT: I haven't tried this with vehicles yet. If someone wants to try that, please post the results. If no one has done so before I get home, I'll do it myself and update with the results.

What you should know ahead of time is that there's many EVE pilots with the ""PC master race"" mentality--that's even part of the established lore, that we're interstellar demigods and all mortals exist to do our bidding. I want to move us away from animosity between our camps. 

Dust mercs need a dose of the backstory to bring you into our fold, as you're the first immortals that are not embodied in a starship hull. Lore is so in-depth for New Eden that I'm disappointed with the new-game-experience for both games and its inability to plunge you into that lore surrounding who you are, why the societies exist in the game as they are, and why you should feel inclined to fight--that there's more compelling reasons than more isk and more stuff.

There's the volumes of [short stories](http://community.eveonline.com/backstory/short-stories/) and entries called [Chronicles](http://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/), each a little piece of the lore that makes up New Eden. And don't forget the three novels: [*The Empyrean Age*](http://www.amazon.com/EVE-Empyrean-Age-Tony-Gonzales/dp/0765363909), [*Templar One*](http://www.amazon.com/EVE-Templar-One-Tony-Gonzales/dp/0765326191) (the better written sequel, which touches on Dust514), and [*The Burning Life*](http://www.amazon.com/EVE-Burning-Life-Hjalti-Danielsson/dp/B004P5OQ4C) (a standalone by a different author). I'm having a splendid time reading these on the slower days of floating in wormhole space. 

That's the exciting thing about DUST514--it's a different lens to experience the same universe of interstellar empires, and I feel it's not fair for you to go without understanding its history. Note that the things I linked don't necessarily contain any of the histories of player-created empires such as Band of Brothers, Goonswarm, Curatores Veritatis, etc., as I don't know a good comprehensive source.

Even getting *one* of you to dive further into the universe is a victory for me. 

TL;DR: EVE player writes wall of text asking DUST players to learn about the lore of the game universe, in hopes other EVE players will not see DUST as EVE-Lite, and you'll have a lot of fun reading.

Edit: fixed links

Addendum: Obviously my intended tone is not coming through. I am here to be nice. I am telling you that other people are not always so nice, especially since it's fun to roleplay an immortal that kills thousands of people a day. And if you didn't have a good experience playing EVE and consider everyone a bunch of dicks, then you've just met the general population and didn't find that niche that was going to be your group of friends. It's a harsh universe, but I'd rather like the people on the ground with whom I'm going to have to share.

I am not the most seasoned of vets on Dust, but hopefully you do not fall for the flavor of the week or month sp traps that will be set for you on day one and the days that follow. It is a must in my opinion that players do not skill into new weapons heavily until the balance is created or it may be wasted sp. In the video you will hear my thoughts on the frustration that will come from day one 6-10 million sp investors that own on the battle field which will make many join the same path, remember patience is virtue, and its ok to not let the sp burn a hole in you're pocket.

So I just downloaded this game - I've had it for exactly one week - and I have no freaking clue what I'm doing. I never played Eve Online either, so I also have no clue what's going on in the universe around me. Here's what I DO know: I DO know that the gameplay seems very similar to Battlefield, and I DO know that there's a medic class.

Now, I gotta tell you, I absolutely love playing as medics. I'm not a huge gamer, but every game I've ever played (from WoW to Battlefield and everything in between), I play as a healer. I will follow you and keep you alive. I will keep ammo pumping into your sweet little ammo-veins. I will throw myself onto your corpse, plunge a needle into your shoulder, and soak up all the fire your way while you run behind cover (and I sadly die).

I don't know why, I just love healing.

So tell me, what exactly do I need to know to be the best medic I can possibly be? I've already started to deck out my guys with pro-infantry healing devices. But that's not enough. I want to make the whole world LIVE. How do I go about doing that? What's your advice? What kind of a medic would you want on your squad?

Because I may end up joining the Reddit corporation, just because of the wicked awesome Starship Troopers puns.

Thanks in advance!

1376899943.0,17,self.dust514,1knm8g,Look a really fucking long post on Shield Tanking getting buffed by Armor Buffs!,abominare,19,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/1knm8g/look_a_really_fucking_long_post_on_shield_tanking/,"In 1.4 CCP has announced that among many things there will be a buff to armor plates. As an exclusively shield tanking player, I simply couldn’t be more excited about the buff. 



**Why?**

Because it means I’m getting an amazing free 44 hitpoints and I’ll move faster. Hoorah for buffing Caldari Assault. 



**I Thought This Was an Armor Buff?**

Indeed armor may be less bad, but shield will be even more awesome. The problem lies in the fact that just like most things, CCP is bad at giving players slot choices. Nearly any buff to armor will always amount to a buff for shield players because of the huge void left by shitty low slots.



**Theres all sorts of cool things to put into lows though!**

No, there is actually nothing remotely useable for low slots besides armor plates, at least as far as an assault character is concerned.  
Lets make a Proto Caldari Assault Fit, quite like mine in fact.
First, we’re going to be a shield tanker, and just like me we’re going to have amazing fitting skills, the only thing we’re going to be missing assault rifle fitting past 1.

I have four highslots, I certainly would like HP, I hear HP is good. 



4x Complex Shield Extenders!


**Wait! What about Damage Mods? Those are totally cool!**

Off the top of your head sure, but we’re going to be a front line guy, and damage mods aren’t worth it, here lets do some MATH!
Our suit will eventually have 582 Shields and 293 Armor. For ease a basic assault rifle with no skills does 425 normal DPS. When we figure out the damage +- to shields and armor this gives us a time to kill of 1.245+.766= 2.011 seconds. Neat.


Now imagine a fire fight where two guys fit exactly the same except one drops an extender for a complex damage mod, they both begin shooting each other immediately at the same exact time in full damage range.


Our fully tanked character will now die in 1.132+.696= 1.828. 
Unfortunately Mr Damage Mod has less HP. 80 HP in fact. Hes dead in 1.074+.766= 1.84 Seconds. 


While at first glance it might look like we’ve narrowly won with a damage mod, lets remember that damage is unequal over time, each shot has damage and a standard AR fires every .08 seconds. This means they both die at the same exact moment, the 23rd shot.
In this case we have a net gain of survivability of zero, for more SP. Adding more damage mods doesn’t do much to help because they get stacking penalties. The only real benefits of damage mods appear when you’re not getting shot. This is why swarms and snipers should stack them. If you’re getting shop generally the extender simply means you’ll die faster if you can’t return fire, or at best barely keep up in a even fight.


So I’m going with extenders, especially since against things like grenades, flaylocks, and mass drivers I’ll live a hell of a lot longer. Since they’re penalized against shields.


 **Ok whatever, you’re stacking shields.**

Now lets fill out the rest of the stuff we want. We a Duvolle AR because we aren’t creative, and we need Adv AV grenades because fuck lavs. 
Unless I’m in a PC match I generally have hives, KD-17/r’s the rep they give ammo, they have a huge nanite count, its what I use. PC its obviously uplinks. 


Uh Oh fitting is super tight already. Lets stick a core flaylock on because honestly we don’t have a choice.


Current Fittings CPU: 393/394 and PG 77/79
Well that escalated fast, What do I have left 3 Lows?


I’m not aware of any  modules that only use .33 CPU, I cant really drop the flay lock down, it would really only free up like 6 cpu anyways. Even if I wanted to go with that damage mod after all it would mean is I’d be out even more CPU. 


**You should drop that stupid expensive Nano-Hive!**

I could, But honestly, to what end? What are my low options anyways? 


1. Armor Reps, lol, okay maybe but honestly even if I need to regen my armor pool, the hive is faster, reps other people (yay free triage points)


2. Shield Regulators? Nah, I’d be giving up armor reps to save myself a second on my regen. Sure its technically 1.1 seconds thanks to skills, but again shields regen every second the bonus is wasted when regening the amount 582. Im honestly either safe or dead either way if Im at 0 shields. Even still I’d really only be able to fit one before I ran out of PG/CPU anyways.


3. Stamina and run speed mods! These things are fucking expensive, even if I could fit a kin cat what am I gaining? Sprint Speed. Not Movement Speed, Sprint speed. I guess I could run to the objective but still be slower than the scout, or even still slower than me just calling in a lav. If im fighting someone I need to be shooting, you know what you cant do when sprinting? Shoot. You know how you can ensure your self to die in a firefight? Not shooting. I don’t have a shot gun or a nova knife, I don’t need to get that much closer. 


4. Sensor mods, these things don’t actually do anything, not even nothing of value actually nothing. They’re mods designed to make you less like to be seen when no one sees you, and more like to see the guy who is already being seen by you.


5.All that leaves is fitting mods and armor plates. So by giving up nothing I currently have fitted I could stick on a cpu mod and two basic plates (with ar fitting maxed you can swap these back to ferroplates later for no movement penalty) this will net me ~143 Extra Hp at the cost of  6% movement speed (a little less because penalties have stacking issues). That’s a little ouch But that is still an extra 4 AR shots, which is more value than any of the other lows. Then thanks to the patch its going to be 187 HP with only 4% move penalty 


Basically the problem is, I either have nothing else that gives value to place in my lows, or never enough fitting to justify losing HP to fit said things. 


Eve doesn’t have this problem, theres a lot of things you really either need or want to fit to begin with. But with dust my options are, A. Shit that doesn’t help in a fire fight, or B. Armor which will make me last longer in a fire fight.


Its pretty fucking obvious what you should be choosing.


**So Nerf Shields?**

No, this avoids the whole problem altogether. You’re ignoring the fact that shield tanking isnt technically stronger on its own, well not really anyways, (after patch at most levels we’re getting a 4th of armor’s hp on shield mods), its that shield tanking is actually multitanking. We don’t have any options but to do so.

I'd love to participate in this community event, but I don't want to have to create a whole new account to do so.  I would happily delete this character, &lt;$alt2&gt;, off the account if only I could preserve my BPOs I earned in beta.

I don't care about the SP/ISK/normal items, just the 'Skinweave' BPOs from beta.

&gt;If this cannot be done, please escalate this ticket to the community relations team as a complaint about the event not being accessible to people with alt characters and ask them to announce if future events will require an open character slot so I can stop buying AUR items on alts entirely.

&gt;
&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your email.
&gt;
&gt;I am afraid we are unable to transfer any assets from one character to another.
&gt;
&gt;Please note that although this particular event requires you to have a free slot in order to be selected as a 'Templar', not having a free slot will not prevent you from participating in the event itself, hunting 'Templars' and ultimately being rewarded as part of the event.
&gt;
&gt;I would also like to mention that **future events with no free slot requirement could occur in the future** and I would greatly recommend you to keep an eye on the DUST 514 Forums for more information.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;
&gt;GM Vegas

I assume he meant 'with a free slot requirement', as 'no free slot' just means we create placeholder alts.  So I have to delete a character with 'Skinweave' BPOs or a character with over $15 of Aur items on it if I wish to have a 200/3000 chance of being a Templar.

If you are you can greatly help out yourself as well as all others in your squad by issuing squad orders.

Assuming you are a squad leader if you hit down on the ps3's D-pad this brings up a map of the battle with a cursor/cross hair you can move around the place. If you place this cursor over an objective (for example a null cannon in the skirmish game type) and hold down the 'X' button a few icons will appear around it. While still holding down 'X' you can use the analogue sticks to highlight one of these options such as Capture, after the icon is highlighted you release the 'X' button and a message should show in the top right of your HUD saying something along the lines of ""new target designated"". Congratulations merc! you just gave your first command! :D

If any squad mate should carry out an order given by you as the leader they will get extra WP and you get a  'Squad Leader commission' which also earns you war points, and we all know what more war points means don't we? Orbital Bombardments ! You can also designate an individual merc in your squad for the rest to defend, doing this is a fantastic and easy way to earn more WP in the ambush game type!

Admittedly this is much easier to do when playing in a squad of corp buddies or other people you know as you will naturally work better together, however even if your squad is full of unknown mercs taking these simple steps and giving a few orders greatly increases your chances of getting more WP, more SP and more Orbitals! I've been in countless matches where the squad leader hasn't done a single thing towards commands or orders and you suffer as a result.

Hope this helps a few newer players coming into the game as it really doesn't seem like there are many that are aware of how to do this     ",,False,self,t5_2sh6s,False,,minmatar,True,t3_17l22l,http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/17l22l/pro_tip_for_new_dust_bunnies_and_how_to_increase/,

I made a build with shotgun and knives, 2 shield extenders + shield regulator and the speed module. That gives me 104 shield and 130 armor. I try to use speed to flank the ennemies and kill them with the shotgun or the knives, however this proved to be a very risky method.

I managed to do a few nice matches (11/4, 12/5) but most of the time I end up with terrible stats such as 1/7 or 0/6, especially when the opposing team shows a little coordination. Am I missing something that could help while playing light ? (a stealth module maybe ?) Is there a way to help the team when playing light ?

In my experience, I have found myself to be incredibly frustrated by two incredibly stupid tendencies:

1)  Not using Drop Uplinks

2)  Not reviving fallen teammates in favor of chasing the firefight.


I've got a few suits that are oriented at behind-enemy-lines operation, aimed at getting my team infiltrated and then stocked (so, scout and logi suits appropriately).  When I play these matches though, it seems like 9/10 times, people prefer the worst spawn point.  Either they want to respawn at the surrounded CRU or all the way back at the MCC, or worse, at the Ambush default spawn.  Is there some reason I'm just not seeing for why people would NOT take advantage of a deployed drop uplink?  You're giving your own team WPs, which could in turn lead to a precision strike.  Why aren't you doing this, random pubby DUST players!

Additionally, I can't stress the number of times I've been in the midst of a firefight, covered by logi and all other manner of fits, when eventually, I die.  My forces, I guess swept up in the movement of the firefight, abandon me there, chasing a kill.  While I suppose that a kill and assist is worth more (75 or 90 with orders, iirc), the res itself is worth more than a kill, and enables further assists, AND provides Triage WPs potentially, ALL while saving your team clones.  Why the hell don't people do this more often?!  I know you're out there, with the damn nanite injectors equipped - the screen is telling me you're there!

Don't feel bad about fighting dirty, sneaking up and unloading your mag into someones back is the best way to get kills.

Run away(especially in Dust), if you shoot 5 rounds into some guy and he takes no damage gtfo, he will turn and butcher you.

Stick together, use teamwork.  Two guns vs one gun usually two guns wins.

Check fight scoreboard, follow people who are doing exceptionally well, learn what they do.  Maps have all kinds of secret places that are good cover or provide advantages that may not be obvious at first.  Playstyle works the same way.  

Spawn camp, free kills, keeps the other team from getting reinforcements.

Learn what your playstyle is good at, using a sniper rifle do not go frontline, also be useful, play with vehicle destruction then use it.  

If it is an objective game do the objectives.

* 2,500 = $9.99
* 5,000 = $19.99

It actually costs 1 cent more to buy 5,000 AUR vs 2,500 AUR, surprising as buying in bulk is generally always the reverse, but CCP logic is at play.

1 Day Boost = 200 AUR approx $0.80 a day using 1 day boosts
3 Day Boost = 350 AUR approx $0.47 a day using 3 day boosts
7 Day Boost = 700 AUR approx $0.40 a day using 7 day boosts

As you can see it's only slightly cheaper then a normal 14.99 per 30/d subscription starting at 3 days (approx $0.50/d for 14.99/30d subscription) while being $0.30 more expensive per day using the 1 day boosts.

I do see that they are advertising 4,000 AUR as a $20 value on there ""Merc Pack"" website, which would make things even more expensive. If we follow the Merc Pack Logic the numbers are as follows:

* Merc Pack advertises 4,000 AUR as a $20 value

1 Day Boost = 200 AUR approx $1.00 a day using 1 day boosts
3 Day Boost = 350 AUR approx $0.58 a day using 3 day boosts
7 Day Boost = 700 AUR approx $0.50 a day using 7 day boosts

These numbers means 30 days of boost using 7 day boosters will costs approx the same as 30 days of EVE, and become more expensive then an EVE subscription if you use 3 day and 1 day boosts.

Is the Heavy II dropsuit better than the Heavy I dropsuit?  Is it worth the upgrade.

As it stands checking the side by side values the differences are as follows:     
* The Heavy II is more expensive by 4000 isk/suit.     
* The Heavy II can run 8% (ish) faster for 2.6 seconds longer.     
* The Heavy I has 750 stock Health.    
* The Heavy II has 742 stock health between two modes of tanking.     
* The Heavy II has better shield recharge rates.     
* The Heavy I can be ran without needing to invest in shield upgrades to get the most bang for your buck out of its 'tank'.    

The real issue I suppose, as the speed is a hands down winner.  Is it worth losing total health (especially if you dont have much in terms of shield control yet and you have lots of field mechanics) to get the speed and the fast recharging (significantly buffered) shield.

To people who have tried it, is it enough of a difference to be worth it?  The Heavy 2 has a few significant advantages if you have the skills to really back it up, but is it worth it earlier?    

Is having a big chunk of your HP in shields worth it?  Are there any disadvantages I dont know about that you cant see just in the stats?

**Scout LAV**


The Problem :
You sacrifice one's fitting ability with decreasing PG / CPU on a vehicle type that's already fairly fragile and decide to replace it with a marginal increase in speed. The difference in speed unfortunately is really quit minimal for what you end up having to sacrifice in the ability to fit effective shield / armor modules. 


Defining Their Role :
My suggestion is a fairly simple one, if we're going to have a Scout LAV then give it an ability that fits their class name. Give them an always on, passive, Scout LAV exclusive module that allows them to provide information on the location of enemy units within a certain range in the same way that active scan modules work on vehicles in their current form.

**Logistics LAV**


The Problem :
I touched on it before but right now the problem is that there's little to no reason to go through the trouble of using the Logistics LAV exclusive Dropsuit Repair Module. The camera control is cumbersome, getting someone to stay still for long enough to get the healing is difficult while in battle, and losing the lock on is far too easy. What we're left with is a situation where people are going to ignore whatever support they can provide on the battlefield and use them as Murder Taxi's instead. Ultimately I'm better off simply jumping out of my LAV, grabbing my repair tool, and manually doing the job instead of having to rely on the LLAV's system.


Minor Problem (Probably easier to address in the short term) :
The Remote Repair module icon looks exactly the same as the repair module one uses to heal one's own armor. I'd like to not be confused as to why my Camera freaks out after trying to rep my own vehicle and realizing that I've picked the wrong module. Unfortunately there's no effective way to really cancel out of this view without activating another module or getting out of the vehicle entirely. Differentiate the icons between armor repair for vehicle and armor repair for dropsuits while inside the LLAV.


The Solution :
The main issue is that you've jerry-rigged the support capability of a Logistics LAV to be analogous to a Repair Tool x Swarm Launcher hybrid when the obvious solution is to make it more like a Nanohive. It's simple, give it a module that produces a field like the Nanohive that will repair armor (far less than a dedicated repair tool would heal on a single target) and provide ammunition to dropsuits within a certain range. Support capability renewed in a far more elegant fashion.

**Overarching Balance Concerns**
I don't want to spend too much time on this but obviously there's an issue with LAVs in the current form of the game. The only suggestions I'd make are as follows :

1. Reduce HP of free Militia Vehicles
Obligatory really, they're far more durable than they need to be for free vehicles.

2. Reduce top speed / acceleration of LLAV variant
Encourages their use as support vehicles instead of murder taxis.

3. Add damage taken to Vehicles when running over dropsuits that scales based on amount of HP dropsuit has left.
This serves a lot of purposes I feel :

* It discourages the use of running people over as the primary source of damage for a vehicle
* Encourages having a gunner in the back to, at the very least, soften up a dropsuit for a kill
* Helps out the Heavy dropsuits who are the most vulnerable to LAVs in their current form, running them over will HURT.

I have a new series called Player spotlight in which I ask a member of the community if they would like to share a bit about themselves so that the community can get a voice behind the gamer tag, and perhaps learn a little about the player as well as learn something new about the game through others opinions and ideas. I would like to thank CHICAGOCUBS4EVER for allowing me to to do this, and perhaps you will appreciate it as well. I will be asking random players in the community if they would like to participate, and will go from there. I hope everybody enjoys the series and thanks alot!

I hear alot of debate and have for some time now how the Viziam and the Laser Rifle in general are supposedly OP. I have run this tool and know from using it for weeks on end that it is no more OP than the AR. What makes this weapon and the AR this so called OP is the complex DMG mods stacked. If you really want to validate a point and not just QQ due to something destroying someone, please use and experiment with the so called OP weapon or weapons. On a Assault B series suit without stacking dmg mods I am able to run around 456 shields with the viziam, with mods around 250 or so . So either a person is tank strong with weak attack or paper thin carrying a time bomb.

2. BPOs (Blueprints) are items not consumed on death. They generally cost Aurum and are for low level items. Other than the armors they aren't too expensive and are great for conserving ISK. *edit(Prices have been adjusted, and BPO prices all went up a lot, probably nearer to release prices)

3. A supply depot installation can be used to swap gear. This is important because if you just swap out of expensive gear you won't lose it. Used something to blow up a tank and now don't need it? Save it.

4. Drop uplinks (spawn points) have limited use, spawning on them gives the deployer a point bonus. Ammo resupply you either get a bonus for squad use or may not be squad use only. Squad leaders can set objectives by pressing Down on the D-Pad. Any point earning action near the objective gives bonus points. When a squad earns enough points the squad leader can launch a precision strike on a target area.

5. You'll find out fast but jump out of the spawn point on the ship and you can not die by pressing X for the ""inertial dampener"". What might not be obvious is this is available anytime, not just from the ship.

6. LAZZZZZZERS - Lasers can be pretty deadly. What is important to know is they have an ""optimal range"" as in at that point being farther OR closer will reduce damage. If someone is lasering you and they are fairly close, move towards them to save yourself.

7. Militia items are items that don't require skillpoints to use. They are the lowest level but they are good to try things with or fill in extra slots you don't want to pay for. Militia items have their own space in the marketplace at the bottom of the root list.

8. Voice comms are pay to use only if you want to talk outside the Team and Squad channel. So only if you want to chat in the ""create your own"" channels will it cost you. As a note whatever channel you are talking to remains in effect when you enter/exit a game. So you can talk to your corp while play but talk to people and coordinate.

9. I've never seen anything as devastating in an online game as watching a squad of coordinated and well equipped players roll through my team in Dust. Talk to people and coordinate. Stick together. It matters.

10. Your vehicles aren't safe ever. They are air dropped and vulnerable during this time. They can also be taken by any player on your team as soon as they are deployed.

11. We will not be mad if you overly revive and we die right away. I'm usually just grateful you used it. There are certainly limits to this but we really appreciate someone willing to even pull out the item as it reduces downtime and saves a ticket from being used.

1362012330.0,10,self.dust514,19d4gu,Current Maximum SP,Tempests_Wrath,14,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/19d4gu/current_maximum_sp/,"Often I am asked, or rather I hear the question asked ""What is the maximum skillpoints someone could have right now?""

I wanted to take a crack at answering it.

The first thing we need are some basic numbers.

First.

For closed beta testers the game started on January 10tOpen Beta launched on January 22 (12 days later for those at home)

Non boosted SP rates are:
27200 active/day (Alight fine.. its 190400 a week, but that works out to 27200 a day and that is what it used to be anyway!)
24000 passive/day

With an extra 50% for having the booster.

The game has its downtime at 11:30 AM GMT (+0:00)

As of yesterday (Feb 26th) the game was playable in its current iteration for: 47.5 days.  the .5 days matters... technically.  It does ok?  Alright fine.  It matters because of the passive exp.  you can only earn the passive exp for the time the games actually been playable, so where you can spend an hour or 2 max max out on active sp (or.. when we had the daily cap), you cant do it for time missed from your passive exp.


&gt;For non boosted players who started 'exactly' (or close enough...) at launch on the 22nd your passive SP earned yesterday was: 852,000 SP

&gt;For boosted players who started 'exactly'  at launch on the 22nd your passive SP earned yesterday was: 1,278,000 SP

&gt;For non boosted players who started 'exactly'  at launch on the 10th your passive SP earned yesterday was: 1,140,000 SP

&gt;For boosted players who started 'exactly'  at launch on the 10th your passive SP earned yesterday was: 1,710,000 SP


So that is one set of the numbers we need.

Now we do active.  This only matters based on the day you started playing, assuming you maxed out every day/week.

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your max active SP earned yesterday was: 979,200 SP

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your max active SP earned yesterday was: 1,468,800 SP

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your max active SP earned yesterday was: 1,305,600 SP

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your max active SP earned yesterday was: 1,958,400 SP


So, now that we know both active and passive SP gains we can determine the total based on start date and boosters.  Im only going to work under the assumption of 1 booster type and that the individual has been running them 100% of the time.  Because I dont like you guys enough to do all the extra math.


&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your total SP earned yesterday was: 1,831,200 SP

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your total SP earned yesterday was: 2,746,800 SP

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your total SP earned yesterday was: 2,445,600 SP

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your total SP earned yesterday was: 3,668,400 SP


But wait you might say!  I have more than that right now!! 

Shush.  Professor Wrath isnt done.

Every account starts with a basic 500,000 not included in the calculations.

In addition everyone who started on the 10th got a 'bonus' 100,000 SP for being active (I think thats why we got it..).

And THEN the 'week in a day' SP... thing... that happened could have got you another 163,000 Bonus (unboosted) SP (not counting the 27200 that the rest of this already assumes you got)

Adding these values in we get...

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your total SP earned yesterday was: 2,494,200 SP

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your total SP earned yesterday was: 3,491,300 SP

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your total SP earned yesterday was: 3,208,600 SP

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your total SP earned yesterday was: 4,512,900 SP


That was yesterday.

But today it all rolled over.

What does that mean!?

*sigh*

It means that today immediately before the next downtime it would be possible to max out your weekly sp and have 190400+24000 SP unboosted. (full weekly plus 1 day of passive)

So the values for TODAY (Feb 27th) are...

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your total SP earned yesterday was: 2,708,600 SP

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your total SP earned yesterday was: 3,812,900 SP

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your total SP earned yesterday was: 3,423,000 SP

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your total SP earned yesterday was: 4,834,500 SP



Not counting the extra SP gained from the soft cap... because I have no way to even guess at that.

There you go! those are the max numbers!

.. I think...

(Im pretty sure im the equivalent of a day or two on the low end.. but I cant figure out where I went wrong as i spent too much time writing this up and its currently all a mess of random characters to my brain...)

Starter weapons are OK, quick and cheap upgrades to analogous weapons don't crimp Isk accumulation all that much.  

For instance, the Tactical Assault Rifle is a wonderful little DR (Halo) equivalent and can be paired with a starter SMG should you buy the SMG operation skill.  All told, that costs you something around .6m Isk for 50 of each + the skill books and the increase in combat performance is a sight to see.

I'm seeing a lot of shield tanking... which is weird given the already plentiful ways of nuking through shields.  Either way, armour or shields, the modules *seem* to be applicable to any suit you drop with.  So a good way to spend initial SP if you aren't a spec that avoids combat.

Tanks are far from broken, which I initially feared.  The starter kit takes out a tank in two-ish shots.  Thats over 1m Isk lost to a free starter kit... Best of the Feels!

Map balance is OK but map rendering is definitely NOT.  Had some major clipping/quicksand effects earlier which people seemed to be abusing (deployment beacon inside of a buildings roof, spawning players inside the concrete).

What overpowered uber dream weapon do you wish you had in DUST?,Dizzywig,16,4,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/1jjpnp/screw_balancing_for_a_bit_what_overpowered_uber/,"Everybody and their mother's made a balance post by now. Let's have some fun. What dream weapon would you like to see in DUST?

I have a few ideas:

* Seeker grenades: Like AV Grenades, but instead home in on infantry. Sorta like spider mines in Starcraft. You could throw one around a corner and drive out or finish off someone behind cover. If it were balanced, I guess it'd do half damage to shields and have vastly reduced damage to locus grenades, but we're not balancing it and it could do the damage of a titan's super weapon for all I care.

* Mortar Launcher + Target Painter: A two-man weapon. A target painter shoots a laser at a point and the guy with the mortar launcher locks on and fires the weapon at the point. The mortar launcher fires at an almost vertical tangent, so dumbfiring this weapon would be...dumb. The shot would travel slowly towards the painted target point, and deal massive AoE on impact. Multiple mortars can lock on to the same point, but one should do enough damage to handle the job alone. A major weakness for mortars would be indestructible roofs.

* Jet packs: It's the damn future, where are my jet packs?

* Drones: Sort of like an Engineer's drone in Mass Effect. You deploy a small drone armed with a gun, and can direct it toward a target where it will fire upon him until he's dead, the drone is destroyed or the controller is out of range. Different races have different weapons, but a logi drone would be cool too.

* Super weapons: Like a ground-based titan weapon. The weapon could be an orbital drop weapon instead of an actual weapon, where hacking and owning it would let you charge up the weapon. The weapon can then be directed anywhere on the map by a player, and be able to wipe out a significant part of the enemy team. I suppose it's a grounded orbital strike of sorts, but hey.

* Player-erected Cover: Filling in an equipment slot, this thing lets you set up a temporary barricade that is either armor or shield based, giving cover on-demand. I suppose a cheese would be to fill a choke point with these things, but let's just say it goes waist high like all cover does. Fun way to block a heavy who can't jump over these walls.

* Intrusion scanner: Jacking this right out of MGS4. Used like an injector on a dead enemy body, the scanner lets you see briefly all available enemy intel for a brief period before their firewalls block out the scan. This way, you can light up the whole map with the other team's position for a while, giving you an edge in intel and finding those pesky canyon snipers.

* Dropship Stabilizers: Okay, not an actual weapon, but I wish dropships could upright themselves after a turn rather than tumble into a death spiral like every other dropship I've tried to pilot. Maybe I just suck at driving dropships.

* Invisibility Cloak: Bringing real stealth ninjas into DUST. I'd trade all my shields to become invisible. It'll probably light up your scan profile like a christmas tree, but you could be moonlighting the enemy team for all you know. Decloak on fire, of course, with relevant cooldowns.

* Heavier-than-Heavy dropsuit: Powered Armor? Instead of regular weapon slots, this dropsuit takes light turret weapons for its arsenal. Mid and Low-slot modules still use the infantry variants.

I can keep going on, but I'd love to see what everybody else would come up with.",,False,self,t5_2sh6s,False,,amarr,True,t3_1jjpnp,http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/1jjpnp/screw_balancing_for_a_bit_what_overpowered_uber/,

Hello everyone

After seeing constant posts from new players (and even some existing players) about them not understanding the game, I have decided to make some tutorial videos for Dust. 

For the first video I'm going to explain the differences between each in-game race (Racial bonuses and suits for example) for those who are unfamiliar with the New Eden universe, but I would like to hear from you about what I should explain in snazzy video form.

I hope to make each video as informative and entertaining  as the [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjch0kBjQI]Way of the Mercenary trailer[/url]

With new players coming out of academy and finding themselves thrown into the deep end of Dust I think it is imperative that more information is out there for players, if you don't think my videos will be up to scratch then check out my previous videos. 

In the past I have made videos for Dust such as 

[A fan trailer explaining the link between EVE and Dust.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM9XVBRL6kk)

[A recruitment video for the Subdreddit EU Taskforce.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXBibiohCLU)

Is there a better/worse race for various roles?  Hacking, actual logi, pew pew assault, etc.?   It's all very confusing, and since the game doesn't have an compare tools, it's hard to tell what to skill into, since it seems like the Logi suits and Assault suits both follow (racial) Medium suit.

Perhaps the story was inspired by FPS sorts of games.

So I'll just say right off the bat that I don't play DUST 514 (And therefore cannot post on the DUST 514 forums). I will say though that I am an EVE player that has a very keen interest in it. 

With the announcement of Planetary Conquest, I am very excited about the prospects of future interaction between the two games, and want to see some amazing stories in the future. 

I enjoy thinking up new ideas for games, and seeing this, I had one. 

Since DUST Mercs are apparently into the biomass industry (passive production of clones for profit and pleasure [shooting each other]), I would like to see some of that affect EVE one day. Specifically, DUST Mercs creating clones for EVE players. 

Not any clones though. New, improved clones. Clones that have much more potential than stock clones bought off from NPC's. 

Why are these new clones coming out planetside labs so special? Well, they have some bonuses most EVE pilots would think very relevant, such as implant bonuses. Implant bonuses would do exactly what you think would happen, increase the efficiency and strength of implants installed in the clone. That's one possibility. The other is the potential for clones with extra implant slots. Yup, more slots for more implants crammed into a single body. I think many pilots would think that very relevant to their interests indeed. 

How will you guys make these clones for the Capsuleer market then? Well, once you guys get your boots on planets aside from the temperate ones, you may have the opportunity to somehow find or extract rare materials from them. I don't know how this will be done, it really is up to the devs at this point, be it through random salvage in a specific game mode, harvester modules, or some other wizardry, you will get these materials. 

After collecting some Nano-Biotic Sludge from the depths of some crag on a Plasma Planet or Neuroenhancing Psychoactive Gas from the core of a Gas Giant or something else, you would then mix and match these materials to create a Capsuleer grade clone with implant bonuses. 

Let's make it fun and make some planets yield such materials unequally, and make a single unit of the stuff you're harvesting increasingly rare in general. I'm sure this can easily be used as a conflict driver in both DUST and EVE, with you guys wanting the hilarious amounts of money for the stuff and EVE pilots wanting to get their hands on the clones the stuff produces. 

Let's make it even more fun, and make such upgraded clones degradable with time, say, a month or so per body, whereupon a Capsuleer needs to buy a new body in order to sustain their implant bonuses. Don't worry, they don't have to destroy implants, they just have to lop off the head of the previous clone and move the brain to a new body. 

So yeah. Long story short, DUST Mercs wade through lava, ice and plasma to get some goo smeared on a wall somewhere on some forsaken planet, slather it on a clone to make it get implant bonuses and sell to Capsuleers for the big bucks.

I find MMO games tricky to test myself as it revolves around community and big chances of games falling flat on face if the community never builds up and or the developer just doesn't punch in more goodies to attract new gamers. (eg swtor ; there was such a big hoopla around it , i just avoided downloading it waiting to see will it get big, i now see it has flopped hard on face).   


So i am wondering how is DUST? I have ps3 original and I wont mind loading it up. Is it a hit or miss? Is CCP/Sony able to keep the interest up and come true to its promises stated earlier?

Just started playing 514 and I've had an interesting first 2 days. I find the game to be an interesting idea with its mix of a simple shooter and an in depth market. 

I heard that getting in bed with a corporation makes the game much more fun. Unfortunately I have no clue if I'm already in a corporation or if that was just the faction I chose at the beginning? I just wanted everyones help at figuring this game out. I spent almost an hour trying to figure out how skills work when it shows SP but then charges me in ISK. Anyways I can honestly see myself loving this game but I need a push in the right direction!

You all seem to enjoy this game and are willing to invest the time to enjoy it as much as possible so I was hoping you kind folks could just give me some advice that you wish you had known when you first began playing.

PS. I have seen a lot of the issues some of you have with the game while skimming through this subreddit and Im okay with them. They're just a small nuisance that I could more easily overlook if I could only figure this game out. 

PPS. I find this to be one of the few games with micro-transactions that does it in a fair way. I usually do well every game, even when I face players who have spent god knows how much time and/or money on this game. The only thing I dislike is seeing all the sweet stuff I cant afford to indulge in. Other than that everything does alright by me!

Player skill always plays part into the equation, but regardless of your tactical ability, fittings have always played a very large role in the ability of an individual in combat to contribute to their fleets, and squads - controller inputs are no different. 

If we are to let them influence the economies of New Eden, the principles of capitalism should ensure that the best individuals are the ones to secure the contracts for planetary conquest. 

But I remember a long time ago when I was first out of the academy, and I was taking a Battlecruiser into Minmatar space, losing it to a tiny ship called a rifter. I wouldn't give up, despite myself losing shields, and armor faster than they were. 

By allowing the introduction of multiple control schemes into the same marketplace you have naturally segregated your community - but allow commerce, supply, and demand to take care of it for you.

They are great for intel on the enemy, with minimal fitting cost, and low sp requirements.  The advanced versions are all you'll ever really need, the best (A-45 Quantum) coming in at 38 CPU and 9 PG, giving you a 16s highlight.  And you'll highlight 99% of players with it.  

Using these is fairly easy, just point and click.  But, after using for a while, I figured out you can sweep it, and still pick everything up, making a longer scan duration a boon instead of a negative like I originally thought.  

The tactics for these is fantastic.  I paired up with a MD user, who was then able to kill people in cover with little problem, knowing when they were coming around corners.  In solo situations, it lets you avoid large groups, cook grenades and time throwing perfectly, and scan to make sure objectives are clear before hacking/leaving.  

Has anyone else used these?  Results?

I figured it'd be nice to see what Aurum actually DOES get the players on the ground, that is, what you guys have actually found Aurum to be useful for.

When I bought the mercenary pack, my immediate idea was to grab both a Logi BP and an Assault BP, given that it came with a Scout BP, and I thought THAT was a great buy (almost all of my 40k AUR).  Well, with my Free-To-Plays (like Tribes) I usually like to toss the developers around the price of a normal game if I like it (50-60), and so I picked up another 40k AUR from the shop and started browsing.  

That's when I realized that the Militia Shop has pretty much every militia item on BP - I'd only been playing a short while, and hadn't realized this.  My biggest issue has been earning cash (esp. with my affinity for dropships), and when I saw these, I knew i had to have them.  Between my 40k AUR, I picked up BPs for my cheap assault suit (3,000isk) and reduced it to 240isk.  I started as a logi, so I have a free artificer suit, and now, I have a sensor damped, shield extended, nanohive-carrying Raven Assault suit that I can lose like it's nobody's business.

Even if I throw the suit away to careless spawning and die 10 times, I still only lose 2400isk - still less than the cost of ONE of my previously ""cheap"" suits.

Now, I earn mad cash and it means that once my skills are up, I won't have any trouble funding vehicles and advanced mods or suits.

The total SP needed [appears to be 117,838,680](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ar8AlJ99Y_oPdDNXclVTUUFSZVRFQjlveG1tQjZjVFE&amp;usp=sharing). I apologize if someone's already done this work. Bear with me for a moment:

* According to /u/SerpentineLogic's [Dustboard skill page](http://dustboard.com/global/skills/), Passive SP accumulates at a rate of 16.67 (rounded) SP/minute (1,000 SP/hour, 24,000 SP/day) if not boosted.
* According to the same page, boosted Passive SP gives 25 SP/minute (1,500 SP/hour, 36,000 SP/day).
* A single skirmish match, for me, yields ~5,000 SP (unboosted) on average. This could be a terrible SP/match ratio, feel free to correct me.
* Assuming the same boost applies to the active booster as does the passive, a boosted match would yield ~7,500 SP.
* A skirmish match takes 20-25 minutes (2.4-3 matches/hour), from the beginning of searching for the match to the killboard screen. This yields 12,000 to 15,000 SP/hour unboosted, 18,000 to 22,500 SP/hour boosted. I haven't played ambush a whole lot, it could be faster to gain SP using this match-type.

With this, we can calculate a few things. Assuming 5,000 SP a match, it would take 23,568 matches to complete the skill tree. Depending on the match length, this could take from 7,856 to 9,820 hours (for reference, there are 8,736 hours in a year). Fortunately, there's passive SP, which cuts it down to 7,365 to 9065 hours. Not a huge change, but there's a difference. In total, here's what you can do playing non-stop:

* No boosters: 7,365 to 9065 hours (0.84 to 1.03 years)
* Passive SP booster only: 7,142 to 8729 hours (0.81 to 1.00 years)
* Active SP booster only: 5,015 to 6202 hours (0.57 to 0.71 years)
* Active and Passive SP Boosters: 4,714 to 6,043 hours (.54 to .69 years)

Remember. This is playing non-stop, DUST time all the time. Doing this might get you a few stern looks from CCP Sreegs as well. Assuming you're not inhuman, you're probably going to only play a few matches a day. If (on average) you play five matches a day, here's what turns up:

* No boosters: 57,717 hours (6.59 years)
* Passive SP booster only: 46,363 hours (5.29 years)
* Active SP booster only: 45,986 hours (5.25 years)
* Active and Passive SP Boosters: 38,478 hours (4.39 years)

The lesson to take from this? If you're in it for the long haul, buy those boosters! They'll literally shave years off your training time. On the bright side, a fully-trained heavy appears to take about a year and a half. What's you guys' training time? Equation for hours:

Most of this comes through watching youtubes of users. So I'm not looking at every gun, but I think the data is the same across all tiers of weapons.

* ARs: 110% shield: 90% armor ---10% against LAV/HAV shields
* MDs: 70% shield: 130% armor
* Laser Rifle: 120% shield: 80% armor

* Lg/Sm Blasters ??:??
* Lg/Sm Missiles ??:??
* Lg/Sm Railguns ??:??

If you want to help:  Get a weapon for which there is missing data.  Point it as a friendly bluedot, be in optimal range, note shield/headshot efficiency by pointing reticle at them and looking at the % modifier.  Have them drop a flux grenade on themselves.

I can't imagine FPS junkies being happy with having their battle lagged, but how else could CCP handle it given that they plan to allow interaction like orbital bombardment and planet-side defense installations?

This in turn, has made me aware of the larger scope of New Eden, and the happenings in it beyond the machinations of Dust Corps.

As many of you are probably aware, the past couple of months have been extremely political in space politics. TEST gave the HBC the finger, and in doing so reset the entire balance of power in New Eden. Now they are at war with the CFC (aka the Goons) for control of Fountain and its resource rich moons, as well as warring with some of their former allies.

Enter us, the mercenaries.

We were all promised meaningful battles once faction warfare and PC were opened up in Uprising, and though they are both an improvement over the old arcade-match-only matchmaking, I still want to feel like I am doing something meaningful to affect the wars between Eve players. In doing this, we become relevant, and the Eve players take more notice, and in turn we become more relevant. Like a successcascade. To do this, They need to open up PC in nullsec. But instead of whatever bonuses they are doing now, instead have district control affect the sovreignty mechanics in a meaningful way. 

****WARNING WHAT FOLLOWS IS JUST IDEAS, NOT NECESSARILY BALANCED OR COMPLETELY THOUGHT OUT DUE TO MY LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH EVE'S SOV MECHANICS. ALL NUMBERS PRESENTED ARE NEGOTIABLE, THEY ARE ONLY IDEAS TO SUPPORT THE CONCEPT****

So, let's say a planet (or moon, fuck yeah, let's fight on moons!) has x districts. For every 6 (number negotiable) districts on a planet/moon (hereafter refered to as a celestial), there is one POS anchoring fort (POSF, name is a work in progress). The POSF itself will have slots (H/M/L) that can be fitted with modules to give it bonuses that affect ground combat (L), infastructure (M), and the POS (H). Examples: railgun/blaster turrets (better than the current ones, L), cloning bays (M), shield extenders (H). However, all these modules would be linked by tunnels/hallways/fightable areas to the POSF in one district map, making it awesome and player affected based on what modules are placed there. Now to make it interesting, the district with the POSF can only be attacked once ALL other districts on the planet have been captured by the attacking party. Capturing the POSF gives you several options: you can either destabilize the anchored POS above and cause it to crash/fail within a set amount of time if the corp owner doesn't move it, or my personal favorite, you can choose to assault the POS with Dust Mercs (THIS MEANS INDOOR COMBAT!!!!). If the assaulting force can capture the  POS control center and hold it for a set amount of time, they can then switch the control over to the corporation they're fighting for. 

Now, in order to make them worthwhile, they need to affect sovreignty. Since I have only a rudimentary (at best) understanding of Eve SOV mechanics, this part is way open to suggestions. I think that the % of districts held by the attacker reduce the time it takes to capture a system by up to 50%. So %100 district control means the system flips %50 faster, 0% district control means the mechanics are the same as they are now.

Now, in order to make the ground battles more realistic/interesting, I think the orbital strike system needs to be reworked:
The current war barge orbital strikes stay as current.
Orbiting player strikes now do something like this:
All ships can be lasered onto targets. The targeting laser is a ground merc piece of equipment. when activated, it stays on for 10 seconds. The amount of time you can keep it focused on your target out of 10 seconds determines the accuracy of the shots inbound on target.
Small ships (frigs/destroyers): 3 second delay between shots fired (Eve-side) and shots arriving (Dust-side), 10m blast radius
Medium ships (cruisers/battlecruisers): 7 second delay, 20m blast radius
Large ships (Battleships): 11 second delay, 35m blast radius
X-Large (Dreadnoughts): 15 second delay, 50m blast radius
Titans: 30 second delay, no targeting required, entire battlefield inside the opposing redlines is flattened
Also, any ships using missile launchers would be able to lock on to any vehicles in the combat zone and fire at them.

Now, in order to make this more than just best-fleet-wins, the owners of districts will be able to ""fortify"" the module in the district (factory, laboratory, whatever), and place it underground. There are 3 levels of underground-ness, each one being more expensive, and adding more defense from orbital strikes. At level 1, all orbital shots have 100% effectiveness. Level 2, small ships are at 50% effectivity, medium ships at 75, and large+ ships at 100. Level 3 can only be hit by large+ ships, and not at 100% effectiveness. PABattleships hit for 50% effectiveness, Dreadnoughts for 75%, and Titans at %100. This would also give us more indoor levels and give heavies a chance to be more than just worthless punching bags like now. With narrow hallways and closely-defined fields of fire they would finally have an environment to shine in! While we are on it, I think HMGs and FG's could have a deployed mode, where they either mount on a tripod or onto a piece of the level that is there (like a crate or something). Doing so would give them a +%dmg, +%range, +%accuracy boost, making them worthwhile POINT DEFENSE SPECIALISTS!

I think this makes fleet support much more valuable in ground operations, and something to fight for/over in space.

Now, for mounting ground assaults, let's do away with the war barge entirely as far as carrying troops/vehicles/OMS beyond the basic 150 clones for a skirmish match. Or rather, let them still be there, but only carry that base level of support. But for going above that base level, we should invite new classes of ships specifically for ground assault/support. Call them Panetary Assault XXXX where XXXX is the ship class (frigate, destroyer, cruiser, battlecruiser, battleship, carrier). These ships can fit guns/targeting systems that allow for faster/more accurate targeting of ground forces, but less effective against other spaceships. These ships also have reduced signature profiles and stuff to make them harder to target by space forces. Maybe they get some limited cloaking abilities too. But the main thing here is the introduction of new modules that allow for better ground ops support. The biggest thing will be the carriers though. The carriers will be able to use clone support modules. These give a +2 bonus to force size on the ground. So if a PAC is there with 2 clone support modules, that team can have 20 different soldiers fighting at once vs 16 for the other team. They can also carry on board clone factories that generate clones, storage facilities to keep them in cryo (more clones for the actual battle), and laboratories to keep them from degenerating before use. The carriers can also carry a shitton of OMS stuff, HAVs, LAVs, DS's, lots of good shit.

Anyways, what are yall's thoughts/ideas? This is just rudimentary stuff but I think it would make the game much more worthwhile and fun, and give the Dust players an important role, not just accessories like they are now.

I'm seeing plenty of other games that look to compete with dust (planetside, battlefield, destiny) and they are looking really fucking solid. Dust, on the other hand, is riddled with crippling bugs, really shitty game balance, isn't even complete (1 out of 4 racial heavies. COME ON), and is utterly and viciously hostile toward newbies.

CCP had a lot of time to whip this game into shape, but instead, they've not really done a whole lot. They fixed the UI and improved graphics, sure, but a lot of other things are/were broken, and, worst of all, the game has only gotten worse for newbies. To top it off, a lot of people have tried dust, got punished for being new, and went to something else.

Right now, CCP only has two selling points: it's free, and the promise of things they will do in the future. That said, many people are assuming that anything of any real value is going to be years off. It's been over a month since the official commercial launch, and they still only have vehicles for 2 of the four races and heavies for one.

I liked dust when I first got into the beta. I like the idea of dust: integration of two separate and very different games, and meaningful pvp. I like many of the functional mechanics. 

It has a lot of really badly crippling problems, though, and it's not improving that fast. The devs seem to be trying to treat this like EVE, where most of the game is already established and all they do is tweak it here and there. Dust is a very different animal, one that isn't really established, isn't really growing much, and is generally just doing poorly. 

CCP doesn't really seem to be doing much about that, and I don't have any hope for the future of this game.

If you use Laser Rifles or Scrambler Rifles (mainly charge variant) and aren't exactly sure about training up for the Amarr Assault dropsuits, let me ease your mind and tell you they are worth it 100%.

Sure they're not as tanky as the Gallente suits, but the amount of cpu/grid you get is pretty awesome (2x complex EASILY) and the SR/LR no longer overheat like crazy. 

Hell, other than the stupid sight, the LR is actually usable now without burning yourself to death.


Anyways, here's a video kinda showcasing the amount of firepower you can get with the charge shot SRs combine with the advanced Amarr assault suit.

Unless you have been living under a rock during the last few weeks, you know that the Human Endurance Event is happening right now.  Play 1, 3, or 5 matches each day and you get some cool loot, changing each day based on how many games you've played.

Here is a link with a better description:  http://dust514.com/beta/human-endurance/

During this event,  i've played with my main for 5 games each day.  When finished, i played a few more games using my alt character connected to my main.  At the end of the week when i was presented with the option of where to put the new stuff, i was able to give all the loot to my main character.  Instead of 50 advanced armor repair modules, i now have 100.

Woot for extra loot!!!!!

Don't forget that even if you can't use this stuff on your main, you should be able to sell it when the player market opens up in May.  Edit:  (IF the player market opens in May.

For this, I generally use proximity mines and Gauged Drop Links (The ones that allow you to have 2 active at the same time).

My questions are as follows: Why is it that I never see any drop links put down by my allies? Is the ""max active"" the number for my whole team or is that per player (I.e. if everyone on my team had Guaged Droplinks, we could theoretically have 32 active at once)? Why is it that even in ambush, most of the time my teammates spawn using the default? Can they not see my droplink or do they simply choose not to use it?

As for proximity mines, does anyone know how strong they are? Do they auto-destroy any vehicle that moves over them or do they deal a set amount of damage? As with other deployable equipment, there's a ""max active"" of 6. Is that 6 per team, or 6 per player? Why does it seem that I have to be really close for the UI to recognize a friendly proximity mine, and why can't I always see them from the map overview?

I started playing back in January during open beta and from what I remember back then we had even less of what we have now (no racial suits at all, no racial bonus', less weapons, less intergration/impact on EVE) plus the graphics were bland and horrible compared to most other games. Yet it was a great game.

Then Uprising came and changed Dust. Added more features, better graphics AND very basic intergration with EVE. And yet we complained.

Then instant battle academy came in quickly to keep newberries and older players with alts from getting protostomped. Yet we complained.

Weapons glitches were everywhere and they have fixed some but not all in a timely manner. Yet we complained.

We have complained and left the game because it is an unfinished product. The devolpers are treating it like how they developed EVE, over time, constantly improving it. And yet we still complain.

Instead of complaining and QQing and bullshiting maybe we should do something. Try helping a newberry get better so he can survive after instant battle academy. Post videos of how a player can improve their gameplay. And stop all this bullshitting and give the devlopers time to produce more of what we want and what we need.

/endrant.

Edit: Before anyone accuses me of not helping and to give an example of how I help, what I do is I create new alts, go into instant battle academy, find newberries, squad up with them, and guide them for a bit. Once an alt has reach the min standards to leave Instant battle academy I terminate said clone and make a new alt and repeat the process.

Edit 2: I probally should have made my point clearly in the first place but here it is: We should not be complaining on websites like Reddit where it probally won't reach the CCP dev team. This will just end up causing the current and potential playerbase to put this game aside and kill Dust before it reaches its full potentional.

It was pretty common for me to land in the top of the killboards, if not in the top 3 or 4. Ever since the patch though, I cant kill anyone! I'm getting destroyed in every match I join. Today I played a game and pulled 3/7 with only like 300 wp. I feel like I cant hit anything with my guns, I don't know whats going on. It doesn't help that everyone seems to be running proto gear in every match for some reason. Why is this happening? I feel like the gameplay has been fundamentally changed. I used to liken it to bad company 2, but now it feels like the inbred cousin of battlefield 3. I really loved this game before the patch, and I still love the concept and setting, but it's incredibly discouraging to go from king of the hill to bottom of the shit-pile, literally overnight. It almost feels like a chore to play these past few days. Does anyone else have any similar thoughts or know the reasons behind this? Discussion is desired.

I usually use militia or Type-1 dropsuits and standard weapons and fittings. What I notice is I usually go down in just a few shots from a GEK, for example and when I shoot people in the more expensive looking dropsuits, it might take multiple shots from my shotgun or a few clips from my militia assault rifle. So when I'm going head-to-head with an opponent, I'm usually the one who dies.

So far, my philosophy has been to make the most of lower-end gear before investing in the nicer stuff, but being noticeably weaker than my opponents has made me begin questioning that. My main goal in public matches is to be isk positive, so sticking with low-end gear allows me to rack up a lot of deaths and still profit. But could I reasonably assume that I'd die less with higher-end gear and still be isk positive?

As of now, I stand to lose very little from death, except for tanking my K/D, so generally my play style has been fairly reckless, kind of a necessity for shotgun scouts.

So for those of you who use higher end gear, what is your play style like? Can you still profit from being spawn killed in those 75k isk suits? Is that extra tank and dps worth it as far as isk is concerned?",,False,self,t5_2sh6s,False,,minmatar,True,t3_1d2epl,http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/1d2epl/thoughts_on_expensive_vs_cheap_gear_in_public/,

But its the not-so-basic things that I don't get. I watched a guy go 15/1 in this one game, yet here I am, going 5/6... I also need some practice actually HITTING the target. Most of my kills are those few people that stop moving for longer than half a second, or other snipers. I can do the ""practice hitting the target"" part by myself, you don't have to instruct me on that. That is just going to take time and a bit of devotion.

Also, how do I not get counter-sniped (or whatever its called)? That is where most, if not all, of my deaths come from. 

I'm not asking for a 1 on 1 tutor (though that would be nice), just some tips to bringing my k/d to a better number.

**Edit:** What I learned in sniping school is! What I learned in sniping school is! What I learned in sniping school is! What I learned in sniping school is!

Sorry, I loved the hell out of that show when I was younger, then it got ruined...

Anywhat, I'm seeing a lot of the same things in these posts. So I guess that means they are rather sound advice since everyone is telling me to do them. Keep in cover, move away from this spot (unless its hard to reach), don't follow the target (put your crosshair/reticule where you think they might go THEN fire), I saw one dude tell me to use heavy suits to prevent 1-shot counter-snipes, Carry nano-hives (I would, but my current suit is kinda low on PG and CPU so... not much room for them). Just general stuff like that. And for the most part, I'm going to follow these tips.

Thanks for all your posts, this can now just become a place to discuss sniping, how to snipe, or whatever. So long as it relates to sniping, I couldn't care less what you do here.
