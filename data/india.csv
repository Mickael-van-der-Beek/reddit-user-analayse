The biggest perverts are usually the guys who are forced to show an extremely moral facade. This is why most eve teasing is usually done with the pretense that the girl was ""asking for it"". The whole incident in Guwahati, the guy rips this girl's clothes off in the name of morality cos she was drinking. An analogy would be the guy bullying the gay kids cos he has doubts about his sexuality. My cousin (from a small town) himself mentioned that he couldn't function normally around girls at his job cos he was never allowed to have normal interaction with any. And he didn't say he felt shy.. he said he was forever horny and frustrated. And now all the discussion is based around making Indians more sexually frustrated! Let's ban porn and alcohol and somehow that makes it safe.

HOWEVER, I'm now in India, and needed to get my passport renewed. What a fucking *nightmare*. But that's ok. I went through with the ""tatkaal"" process, and after some prodding to get some ""verification certificate"", ended up having to pay a ""premium"" (bribe) before I could get the passport.

Ok, cool. So I just had the *last* step to be taken care of - the ""police verification"". So this inspector comes to my place, sits down like he fucking owns the house, and starts demanding documentation after documentation to verify that I'm the actual tenant in the house. No prob officer, I've got a fucking stack right here for you to go through.

And then...he demands money ""or else I will cancel the passport."" What the fuck is this shit? Does this happen on a daily basis with you guys? How do you guys handle such fucked up, blatant corruption? What the fuck?!! I gave the bastard 500 rupees, and can only pray that he does not ""cancel"" the fucking passport.

Totally fucking disgusted. The system in this entire fucking country is designed to hinder progress and frustrate the living fuck out of anyone.

I can't wait to leave. What a shithole.

1360996065.0,215,self.india,18mkwq,Do your bit to make /r/india a friendlier place! (Please upvote for visibility),Reddictor,276,61,159,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/18mkwq/do_your_bit_to_make_rindia_a_friendlier_place/,"Hi /r/india! 

The most common complaints about /r/india arise because of it's culture. Downvoting, abuses and hostility towards differing opinions are very common. We've all had our days when we recoil, aghast, from the cesspool of comments on a particular thread.

Nevertheless, the cloud has a silver lining. Older users will agree that things have improved significantly since the days of the multiple -ki-baap, -ki-maa, and _spokesperson accounts. How can we nurture and sustain this delicate green shoot of civil discussion? Here are some guidelines, adapted from [reddit's ettiquette guide.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

###1. The downvote is not a ""dislike"" button
Please do not downvote a post or a comment only because you think it's wrong, or you're not interested in it. 

Downvote **posts** if you think these kinds of posts do not belong on /r/india, or if you've seen the same content being posted multiple times before. Multiple posts of a single breaking news events, million photographs of ""farmers"", and links to FB flamewars are good examples of posts which I would downvote. 

Downvote **comments** if you think it is harmful to the discussion. Rude attacks on other users, paranoid conspiracy theories, and _some_ trolls are examples of comments I would downvote. I don't like Modi, but many times I have upvoted comments which support him because many people have different opinions, and I respect that. 

###2. Redditors are real people too!
This is an anonymous internet forum, and it's easy to temporarily forget that the user you're speaking to is a real person, with family and a life and her own problems, likes and dislikes. So before you call someone an idiot, retard, chaddi, Congie, etc., please think: would you do this to a real person in your life? What makes you think it's okay to do that to people on reddit? 

###3. /r/india is mainly what users make it
A subreddit is mainly determined by what its users do. If you want more self posts, submit more, and upvote them when you see them. If you want less politics, ~~downvote~~ IGNORE politics posts, and submit and upvote more non-political content.     
If you are not okay with insults and rudeness, then leave a _polite_ reminder asking people to be more civil. Downvote only the worst comments.

----

tl;dr: The next time you feel an urge to downvote someone politely saying something about Modi, Sachin, rape, SRK, or how your hometown sucks, please DON'T. Even worse, don't insult them for their opinion. _Explain_ why you disagree, instead.  
Don't _only_ complain about content, please contribute content you would like to see. ",,False,self,t5_2qh1q,False,,,True,t3_18mkwq,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/18mkwq/do_your_bit_to_make_rindia_a_friendlier_place/,moderator

",PARTY_ROCK_PHANTOM,239,51,202,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/tl0ux/rant_the_indian_culture/,"Do you know that feeling when you're playing a race game on the computer, against the computer and on the highest level? If you're a novice gamer, the experience is nothing but a never ending story of trying to catch up with the computer player. Trying to catch up. Trying to catch up. Trying to catch up and just that.

The above scenario reminds me of a Social Science chapter I had in school three years ago. It was about the Industrial revolution that took place in Europe in the 19th century and the challenges that were faced by the people in coping up with all the new kinds of machines and gadgetry.

I believe India is going through one such revolution right now.
 
Let's just call it a cultural revolution for brevity's sake, for we all know, like all things in India, this revolution might also have a billion varieties and types and segments and reservations and quotas.

All I'm trying to say here, is that with this revolution, even though we are not consciously aware of it, everything around us: our culture, the way we speak, dress, talk, communicate - is changing. Rapidly.

Now saying 'rapidly' is relative. Let's discuss this relativity.

Take my father for example. He's just one generation - one hierarchy level - above me.
 
In his time, most people did not listen to hip-hop, rock or Justin Beiber (which is a good thing). Most people who lived in the cities then barely spoke any English. They probably wore generic, mundane clothes, went about their jobs and ... I don't know. I didn't live in that time, but they were mostly non susceptible to a variety of cultural changes every day. Why? Because MTV, Bindass, Discovery and Google.

Let's talk about today.

I'm 18. I can speak English. I know plenty about the world (which in itself is subjective). I can speak English. I can use computers and I can find the answer to any question using a search engine like Google. 

I know plenty about sex.

But my parents never told me about it.

Which makes sex-talk with parents a very awkward time, not that it happens frequently. It just never happens.

——

I have a beef with older generations. Yes, that's a fact. And make that beef plural.

I grew up with a generation gap. A lot of it. There are several things I just simply don't understand about older people.

I want to know how they expect a boy or girl going through puberty to know about all the changes going on in him or her. That stuff isn't taught in school until grade ten. Now unless you have a rocket-boosted Pineal gland that delayed your puberty, being told jack-shit (yes, grade ten sex ed. is nothing like sex ed. It's taught like math. And math is scary) about why you get an erection or what's that white fluid does no good for a kid who's been living through it for more than a year already! He might as well believe that he has penile cancer! 

Sex talk is taboo. Porn is taboo. You have a girlfriend? That's taboo. You had three boyfriends? You must be ""character less"".

Then suddenly marriage.

Oh wow, have fun on the honeymoon!

When are you getting us grandkids?

In the name of Shiva's lingam, I want to ask older people, and you - if you have kids - How exactly do you expect someone to shoot an airplane with an RPG without giving him handgun training first?

Yes, you create terrorists.

Then you don't like the terrorists.

Basically, the younger generation in India is a social terrorist. 

I'm going to put ""social terrorist"" in my goddamn resume.

——
The current year is 2012. If some people are to be believed, the world might end by the end of this year. 

But this lady in my neighbourhood would rather worry - and quite devoutly - that her daughter must not ""hang out"" with guys. That girl is 19.

I have a 20 year old female friend in South India. She would rather not tell her parents that she's dating.

A good male friend of mine, 17, just had a mini heart attack last week when he discovered that his girlfriend's parents might have discovered his two year long relationship with their daughter.

I know twenty five year old guys who would rather not discuss their relationships with their parents. Or the fact they they ARE in a relationship.

And then I got threatened with my legs (to be chopped off and thrown in the river) when my first girlfriend's mom found her talking to A BOY! Oh god, a BOY! Initiate evacuation sequence!

Dear older generations, please explain to me why your kids can't talk about the people they like and love. Please tell me that why, if your kids are doing nothing, but acting on the simple biological response brought forward by their hormones, do you have to be all Bruce Willis-yippi-ki-yay-kiddo! on them?

You love your kids. You know they love you back. But you don't want to hear that your kids might like other people too.

Oh god you sure are a selfish bunch.

——

Here's a fact. If you hide something from somebody for too long and especially make them know that they won't get to see it, the only thing that person would strive for from that moment onwards is to get a hold of that thing and see for himself what was so special about that hidden mystery that he could not partake in its glory earlier.

That reminds of Delhi.

No, just kidding. That reminds of rape, leering, groping, eve teasing.  

I'm pretty sure that most people who rape others haven't had sex before, but don't quote me on that because that's not the kind of thing people ask them later. But you should probably ask their parents about the upbringing of their, I quote India TV, ""Haivaani raakshas"" son. That rapist son would probably have had the kind of upbringing where he was not allowed to hang out with girls, where, in his own home, women were berated, objectified, degraded and given the least magnitude of respect. Where, in his home, he was taught that ""ladkiyan to parayi hoti hai"" and that ""jaa beta, aish kar, koi pooche to mera naam le lena"" and that ""your sister has had a divorce, you can't eat on the same table as her"".

But I quote India TV again, ""In haaivano se hume kaun bachaye!?"". India TV for Bharat Ratna, I say. 

I do not condone rape. I do not condone any such vicious actions. I, however, condemn the punishing of the doer while overlooking the teachings of his teacher. 

——

The teacher.

The teacher is ""Indian Culture""

If I had the chair of the Prime Minister, hypothetically speaking, I would immediately sack any minister in my cabinet that suggested a law on the ""lines of Indian Culture""
I would cancel the license of any news or entertainment channel that passed of it's anchor's views as ""Indian Culture"".

Oh wait, I would probably also get arrested people who announced their own, deceptive and vile opinions as ""desh ki sabhayata"".

Thinking about it, I would make such an awesome Prime Minister.

However, In all seriousness, If there is one such thing as ""Indian Culture"", I really hope that it can be segregated and chopped down into pies. I really don't want a pie of the ""Indian Culture"" by my name that says disgusting, meaningless, anti-scientific, anti-social and anti-freedom things such as that my female friends, those who I have known since I was 6, can't walk the street with me at 9pm wearing something as graceful as a skirt; that two people who like each other and are totally minding their own business without hurting other people physically, can't kiss each other standing on a sidewalk. (People who object to that should probably get their gonads surgically removed. The lack of testosterone in their system will please them.)

I don't want any part of ""Indian Culture"" that says wearing what makes me comfortable (without showing my privates) must be approved by a ""moral police"" (which, according to me, is formed by none but the most criminal, violent minded and unemployed people.) 

I don't want any part of ""Indian Culture"" that belittles people for being opinionated, scientific, agnostic or atheist.

I don't want any part of ""Indian Culture"" following which schools and colleges suspend students for showing affection on-campus.

I don't want any part of ""Indian Culture"" that tags me a rebel, barbarian or lowlife for making choices that will affect only me and just me. 

And lastly, I don't want any part of ""Indian Culture"" that looks down upon sharing information that is essential for life and happiness.

If you have an ""Indian Culture"" that has none of these things, please do let me know.

I bought her a packet of biscuits everytime I passed her for the next few months, I had to open the packets for her before placing them next to her as she would struggle with it.

One exhausted day I sat beside her and shared some fried rice, sitting beside her on the footpath because I had spare time and nothing important to do but have lunch. I never learned her name, but she ate silently with me.

She stopped sitting there one day, I don't know what happened to her, probably dead.

I would place some clean water and food beside her. I used to put aside rs. 1000 a month for her, soon I ended up putting aside rs. 5000 a month and feeding some more of the elderly homeless I would meet. As I got richer, the more time I would spend with my reduced, convenient commute to spend some time with my city.

I've met many people now who spend some time doing the same, directed to more organised groups that care for our poor.

I go hiking regularly to clean the route of waste and plastic, I help with clean up drives where I can, I love being the first to spot an area which is starting to get littered and cleaning it immediately. I get great satisfaction when I see that it is still clean a few weeks later.

I do not bribe, I do not break the red light, I have committed no injustice to my fellow man except for torrenting many tv shows I guess. But maybe it's just because I am not a powerful enough citizen to have had to face these situations on a more daily basis. I vote for my local representative who delivers on his promises of improving the locality to some moderate satisfaction, I do not think about the larger scheme of things. I like honesty but I've cheated on my girlfriend a few times, and there I am a dishonest man.

The roads are always dirty, somebody always breaks the red light, and people immerse their filthy toxic ganesh idols into my lakes and rivers.

But there are always people who care for stray dogs, there are people like me who love cleaning, there are people fighting for justice, I've met so many people and they do so much I can never dream of achieving.

Then I read about people complaining about India, like it is one entity, about how we need a **reality check** how our air is impure compared to new-york, etcetera.

I've breathed the air of the Alps, my world is still beautiful and if you can't help you can work your 9-5, buy your car, then buy another car, buy a large tv, but just get out of my way.

Edit : I'm rambling, because I'm sleepy. Maybe a little drunk.

**tl;dr : Stuff**

Edit again : Many nice comments, I'm still drunk, thanks for kind words though. Biscuits are very calorie rich and a decent way to stave off hunger. Packets cost as little as 4rs. Some bottle tap water from home and a packet could mean well.

i can't tell you how happy i am today. i just gave a presentation in front of my class. for most of you it would not be a big deal. but to tell you about this day's importance i have to go back a little in my history;

i was a very achieving student until my high school. i took part in every kind of extra curricular activities(sports, debate , quiz). in India our high school goes from class 9-10. after that comes intermediary i.e..11-12. and then college. i was a boarder and during the last year of my high school i was caught having sex.. with a guy. i can't tell you how much i was bullied during those 4 months. India has a very homophobic environment. i was thrown out of my soccer team. people who claimed to be my friends threw used condom , chalk or anything they could find at me. but the one thing that affected me the most was how much i hate i got whenever i went to speak in front of a mass . i was anchoring an event and whenever i would come on stage , my classmates, seniors and even juniors started screaming ""homo"" . i am very ashamed to admit that i thought about committing suicide on that night. 

i changed school and cities but could not remove the fear of crowd from my mind. For a person who has an opinion about everything under the sun, this fear crippled me. I went through a period of depression and the worst thing was that i could not share it with anyone of my parents or friends. this thing continued through the first year of my college life. but yesterday my teacher pleaded with me to give a presentation(topic: Booker T Washington) so that she could give me the marks that i intently kept losing through two semesters. i started crying last night because i was so afraid of standing before my class. but then i made my mind to just go with it tomorrow.

In the morning i stood before the class and was shaking like a leaf. i could feel everyone judging me. but then i looked at my friends and slowly started speaking and didn't stop . It was amazing. i felt a feeling that had gone too long from my heart. i have been jumping with joy but i can't still share it with my friends. so i am sharing it with you.please have hope if you are in a place of darkness.

with love

""Kaunsa game?""
""Wahi jo propose karne ke baad, haan ya naa ka wait nahin karte, bas game shuru ho jaata hai!""

This is how the conversation around me went. I was the only woman in an overnight bus full of north Indian males (going from Dehradun to Delhi) and one non-north Indian male friend, who was just as cornered as I was.

We had the option of getting off the bus, finding another one, a state bus at least, one with one or two women in the least, we were still at ISBT. But after an hour's mulling, I decided to stay and see this through. 

The five men were drunk, the abuses kept getting louder - it was never directed quite straightforwardly at me, but it was clear what was intended. Every other passenger, except my friend and I, pretended to be asleep even though the abuses and laughter were too loud for anyone to fall asleep.

The lights were switched off. I wondered when and how this would escalate, how far they would go. Or would they just get tired and go to sleep?

I tried to stay upright, willing myself not to fall asleep even when they quietened down, staring straight out of the window. They kept speaking of the ""game"", and when and how they would start it.

I had lost my phone. My friend's phone was almost out of battery and we probably had charge enough to make just one call. I could think of only two people to call and one of those numbers I couldnt remember. So I called the one I did remember and spoke loud enough for everyone to hear. It was a small bus. 

""Hello, this is Trina. I am on bus number such and such going from Dehra to Delhi. I am the only woman on the bus, and there are some drunk men. I am not feeling very safe, could you send me the number of the helpline for women in north India? Yes, it was started after the Dec incident in Delhi. Yes, online."" 

I knew there was probably no such helpline, only a helpline that operated in Delhi since December. But the bluff worked. They quietened down. After I hung up, there were some half hearted attempts to continue the jokes, but they stopped, by and large.

The man behind me, who had been laughing the loudest, was staring at me when I looked back: ""Bhaisaab, mere seat se aapke payr hataiye."" 

I tried to speak loudly and clearly, even though I was scared stiff. It was pitch dark. He listened.

When the bus stopped at a dhaba in Roorkee in the middle of the night, I was still wide awake. The five men got off. They stood around smoking and whispering to each other, staring at me occasionally from below. I tried to look straight into their eyes. Some of them may have been younger than me. It was menacingly hostile.

When the bus started again, I said to my friend: ""Kya kar lenge? Kitni door jayenge? Maar dalenge? 5 min ki masti hai na? Ya usse zyada? Kya kya risk karenge? Jo bhi karein, agar zinda Dilli pohachi, I wont leave them alone. I will search out and destroy each of them. And if I dont get back alive, there are friends who know where I am, who I know will do the exact same thing for me. Log darte hain, so yeh sochte hain kuchh bhi chalta hain.""

Then I said: ""I should start using my phone camera. Can you get on the internet now from your phone?""

The last two were bluffs. I didnt even have a phone, and my friend's phone was dead. But the men were silent. Apparently. Or this time, they were pretending to be asleep.

I sat up awake most of the night. We reached Noida safely at dawn.

Had considered not writing this down. Was a reasonably minor incident: that could have escalated, but did not.

On the other hand, if it had turned major, I probably wouldnt be here writing this. Anything might have happened, or nothing. 

The men would have probably joked around and fallen asleep anyway. Even if I hadnt spoken, or made that call.

I considered not writing it because it might sound like some weird tale of stupid bravado, which it wasnt. It was mostly a strange stubborness I suddenly felt about getting off of the bus, I didnt want to. I did not want to admit I was afraid. Was there reason to be? Should women be afraid if they find themselves alone with strange men on an overnight bus in north India? I dont know. 

I was just determined to finish that journey on that bus, with the drunk men shouting and laughing about their ""game"", their feet edging into the back of my seat. If it was a game of nerves, I wanted to see it through. If it was more, I wanted to see how far they would go.

This is how it happened, and after much mulling through the day, I am putting it down.

A minor incident. Getting on a bus. Minor it should be. Then why this torrent of fear that I had to cross?

I have qualified for admission to IIFT delhi for the 2013-2015 batch. They have increased fees by almost 2 lakhs this year. The overall cost with addition of hostel, food and various other things would amount to about 15 lakhs. Now the problem is that I can't find a bank who is ready to sponsor this amount. I was banking heavily on the SBI scholar loan scheme but they have all of a sudden changed their criteria and as a result IIFT students are not eligible for more than 7.5 lakhs of loan without collateral. I am from a lower middle class background and can not provide a collateral. So can you please point me to a person or organisation who can provide me a loan without collateral at a reasonable interest rate? I'm really worried that I might not be able to pursue my dream even after securing admission to a top MBA institute of India. 

Tl;dr: Can you please guide me towards a education loan provider who will provide a loan of 15 lakhs for IIFT without collateral?

EDIT:I've found an alternative in UCO bank premier education loan. Thank you all. I am happy. :)",,False,self,t5_2qh1q,1371757993.0,,,True,t3_1goa30,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1goa30/rindia_can_you_help_a_fellow_redditor/,

I am a ""middle management"" civil servant (Indian Foreign Service). I've been a diplomat for over a decade, and have served in many countries and traveled to even more for work. I don't want to discuss questions that would hint at my identity, but I'll be happy to answer questions about the workings of my beloved Ministry and the Indian Foreign Policy to the best of my ability. I will not be disclosing any classified information, obviously. I'm also happy to take questions about the Civil Service Examination process.



I'll be online for an hour or so, but will come back tomorrow to answer more.

A newly married woman was gang-raped in the rape capital of our country (Delhi). She approached Aam Aadmi Party - Delhi. AAP volunteers immediately rushed to help her.

Delhi police were back to their old attitude &amp; refused to register an FIR. But, were compelled to register the FIR by the AAP volunteers who then had to face the wrath of the Delhi police.

15 of the volunteers were arrested &amp; later presented before the magistrate. The state in which the volunteers were brought was SHOCKING. They had been beaten mercilessly. The volunteers said that police kept saying - ""Aam Aadmi Party se ho, ye lo, aur lo"". It seems police was taking out some kind of revenge.

When they asked for WATER, CAN U BELIEVE...... they were given URINE......Their hands and legs were broken.. with plasters &amp; with several wounds on their bodies. Some of them could not even walk and had to be lifted bodily to be presented before the magistrate.

What was their crime ???? They all had gone to the police station ONLY to demand FIR in a gang rape case.

Arvindji has tweeted :

** In police walon ko or sarkar ko pata nahi ham kis mitti ke bane hain.

** If police or govt thinks they can threaten us or stop us like this, they are mistaken. This has further strengthened our resolve.

** Volunteers will be presented at Karkardooma at 2 pm

Today if we do not see Arnab Goswami / Rajdeep Sardesai / Rahul Kanwal / Nikhil Wagle / Rajiv Khandekar / Uday Nirgudkar taking this issue big time. They are NOT fighting for the cause, for the country, for the citizens.

If they don't cover this......I will assume that......

* They don't care for a rape / Gang rape. They talk about it just when they have some extra time

or

* It is NOT being taken up because they have been directed NOT TO COVER Aam Aadmi Party volunteers.

* Those stupid volunteers who have made the blunder of fighting for the country.
* Those idiots who have a dream of changing their country &amp; make it a better place to live in.
* Those silly people who have defied the system by putting their life at stake, their jobs at stake, their family at stake.
* Media cares only and only for TRP &amp; for their balance sheets which are likely to swell as we go close to 2014 (if they don't cover AAP).

I am really upset, agitated &amp; feeling helpless. How do I live in a country where poor are looted and yet helpless. Where politicians are goons yet protected, where police are corrupt &amp; ruthless, where media is existing and yet selectively covering only the mighty and most importantly where ........ The ELITE citizens of my country care a damn for the country &amp; want their children to go to US / UK and never come back.

I am deeply distrubed............. very very disturbed

**1. Posts which are puns on the word ""border"":**    
Saree borders, Allan Border, Border the retail outlet, google maps of borders, the movie border... We all appreciate puns as much as the next person. What should have been a pictorial pun thread, though, became a deluge of nonsensical posts with no relation whatsoever to India. We've removed the worst offenders (a DOZEN people thought of the Allan Border pun), but let the ones remotely related to India stay.    
The next time you guys think of a hilarious pun, we recommend you submit it as a comment in the same thread, not as a seperate post, or TWO DOZEN seperate posts which quickly kill the joke.


**2. Posts about Pakistan:**    
We understand that the events in Pakistan have a bearing on India. However, linking to news articles about things happening in Pakistan with no relation to India is just unacceptable. If you really want to talk about it, make a self-post, link all the articles you want, and explain how it affects India. The same goes with articles about rape, sex, corruption, etc. etc.: If it isn't happening in India, submit as a self-post and make the effort to explain how it affects India.

**3. Marking NSFW:**    
If there's any doubt that your post might be unsafe for work, please do mark it as NSFW. Pictures of topless women might have been unremarkable in 15th century India, but today it might offend a prudish manager somewhere. Also, submitting pornography is NOT OKAY, even if the actors are speaking (grunting?) in Hindi or any other Indian language.

**4. Self-promotion:**    
We discourage links to your blogs because then this forum degenerates into a way to get views. If you're a new user, and you link to your own blog, the post WILL be deleted. However, if you're a regular contributor, occasional links to your blog or website will be tolerated. This is inherently subjective, of course, and we will leave a message when we delete self-promoting posts.

Tl;dr: Posts not related to India even if they are very punny, posts not marked NSFW, porn, and self-promotion of your own blogs will be deleted",,False,self,t5_2qh1q,False,,,True,t3_16ogbd,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/16ogbd/of_puns_pakistan_and_post_removals_please_upvote/,moderator

A warm welcome to all the new subscribers who have joined us over the past few months.

We reached the 10k mark in August, which means that we've grown by 3000 subscribers, or 30%, in a little over 3 months. This continues a trend of steady growth which /r/india has [seen over the past two years.](http://i.imgur.com/w9y8UOu.png) A quick look at the [traffic over the past few days](http://imgur.com/IVk8YZ6) also shows that we're adding about 30 new subscribers every day.  

At this rate, we'll be growing at 80-100% every year. This means that by Jan 2014, we're likely to have about 25k subscribers, of whom the majority will be new. 

So we'd like to ask the community a few questions: 

1. What do you like, or dislike about /r/india as it is today? 
2. If you're a subscriber who joined us recently, how did you hear about /r/india? 
3. If you could make three changes to /r/india, what would they be?

###1947: The state of agriculture

The biggest influence on agriculture in India today can be traced back to the British. Through centuries of destructive trade policies, a single-minded policy geared towards collection of land revenues, and co-opting the richest elements of Indian society, they destroyed the eventual process of industrialisation, and left Indian artisans and farmers in a pitiable state. Nevertheless, there were some positives, characteristic of the British rule. The expansion of canal irrigation, which the British initiated and supported, provides irrigation to areas across the country till date. 

On the eve of independence, there were tons of problems facing Indian agriculture.

- Land problems:
    Most of the land was owned by landlords or moneylenders, and the actual farmers had merely the status of tenants on the land. In addition, most of the land was fragmented, through sale and inheritance, into very small plots of sometimes untillable sizes. Thus, most farmers were subsistence farmers, growing only enough for their own needs.

- Production problems:
    Indian farmers, by and large, still depended on the monsoon for rains. All irrigation systems covered only about 14% of the arable land. In addition, yields of most crops were woefully low, due to the utter absence of any kind of technology or capital investment. 

- Financial problems:
    Most farmers were extremely poor, and had very little chance of tolerating any kind of mishap to their crop. Rural credit was available only through usurious landlords. In addition, access to markets was hampered by poor infrastructure, and cartels of traders who conspired to buy crops at lower rates. 

- Human problems:
    Agriculture, at the time, employed nearly 70% of the Indian population. The production of food grains was insufficient for consumption. In 1951, for example, nearly 4.5 million tons of food grains had to be imported, compared to the production of of about 45 million tons. The threat of famine was ever-present. Most farmers were illiterate and unaware of modern practices. The land situation was intricately tied in with the complicated and stratified rural society, making change incredibly hard.
		
###The first five year plans

The  first five year plan attempted to tackle most of these problems on a war footing. Giving the ""highest priority"" to agriculture, nearly 31% of plan expenditure  from 1951-56 was devoted to agriculture and allied sectors. The main policy of the plan, which has been followed by every single successive government, was to try and provide an economical livelihood for the farmers, with a degree of financial safety, while simultaneously ensuring that sufficient food was available to feed everyone in the country. 

Perhaps predictably, the greatest emphasis was laid on increasing agricultural production. Nobody wanted to see a famine, and food sufficiency was a matter of national security as well. A multi-pronged, top-down approach was adopted: several large irrigation/hydropower dams were constructed, agricultural research institutes were founded, as were PSUs for the production of fertilisers and pesticides. ""Community development programs"" and ""agricultural extension services"" were provided throughout the country, and efforts were made to promote rural credit. 

Simultaneously, most state governments passed land reforms laws, guaranteeing tenancy rights and land ceilings. Implementation of these, though, varied wildly from state to state. In several states, land reforms were half-heartedly implemented due to stiff political opposition from landlords. 

The first Plan was fairly successful in achieving its overall production targets. A production of 62 million tons of foodgrains was targeted, and 67 million tons was achieved. 
	
###Government intervention in markets
	
- PDS (Public Distribution System): The PDS was first intended to be a mechanism for ensuring minimum food supplies to cities. In a situation where famine was a real possibility, and traders in cities were notorious for trading, it was felt that a government rationing of food, and limited supply through fair price shops, would help avoid famine. By the 1960s, the PDS had morphed into a food supply scheme at subsidised rates to the entire population. 

- MSP (Minimum Support Price): The Government announces a minimum support price for certain crops. Essentially, the Government commits itself to buying considerable quantities of grain at a ""reasonable"" price , usually set higher than the production costs for that grain. This has the effect of increasing prices overall, as any farmer who gets a lower price than the MSP, can in theory choose to sell to the Government instead. The government buys and sells food through the Food Corporation of India
	
The PDS and the MSP form the two legs of the Hercules that is the food subsidy system in India. The overall system at present operates as follows: http://i.imgur.com/3eAMM.png

		
###The Green and dietary revolutions
	
Since the PDS/MSP regime was put into place, there have been two major changes. The Green Revolution succeeded in finally eliminating the deficits of foodgrains which the country had persistently been facing. Productivity of rice and wheat shot up in irrigated areas, especially Punjab and Haryana, due to the usage of high yielding varieties of crops, machinery, and chemical inputs. Thus, the overall situation of the economy was transformed from a calorie deficit to a calorie surplus economy. 
	
Everyone's heard of the green revolution, but not too many people are aware of the second, equally important factor influencing Indian agriculture today: The dietary revolution. With increasing prosperity and a greater variety of foods produced in India, people started shifting from a cereal-intensive diet to a more diversified diet. For example, in rural India, the consumption of cereals declined by 17%, while the consumption of edible oils, dairy products, and meats increased by 45%, 18%, and 65% respectively, between 2002 and 1992. 

There is some debate on what the dietary shift implies, especially for the poorest section of society. One section of people believe that this means that the poor are deliberately spending more on diverse sources of food, whereas another section believes that despite the diversification, the absolute amount of calories consumed have reduced, which means that malnourishment has increased. What is not disputed, though, is that the change in diet has taken place, across all sections of society.
		
	
###The curious case of the rotting grains
	
Now we have all the ingredients to explain the situation.
	
- The states, under political pressure from farmers, hikes the MSP beyond the Centrally mandated MSP. 
- This causes the FCI to procure grain at rates higher than the open market rates for newly harvested grain. 
- The eventual sale of this grain at these higher rates ends up increasing the price of wholesale grain, and thus reaches consumers at a higher price
- This higher price further reduces the demand for foodgrains, and leaves the FCI with excess foodgrains, as its initial procurements don't take into account the reduced demand
- In an ideal scenario, the reduced demand will lead to reduced prices of foodgrains, causing farmers to switch their next crops to other, more valuable crops. However, the artificially high MSP hides the fact that there is reduced demand for foodgrains from the farmers, many of whom continue to grow foodgrains
- When there is no demand for these foodgrains, farmers mobilise politically, and demand a hike of the MSP in order to prevent catastrophic losses. Thus the vicious cycle continues. 
- Thus, every year, the FCI ends up procuring grain far in excess of what is needed, and is forced to dispose it a huge loss.
		
Earlier, while the economy was in a foodgrain deficit, grains procured even in excess would have been easily sold at market rates due to high demand. The entire system has now broken down, now that we have enough food in aggregate to feed ourselves. 
Of course, given the inefficiencies of the PDS, and the fact that quotas are centrally set, this means that grains in Haryana and Punjab sit idle, while BPL individuals do not benefit from the extra procured grains.

I am an American that met a wonderful Indian girl while we were both working for the same company in the US. We fell deeply in love with each other, but the only problem is her Telugu parents are not accepting of us because I am 2 years younger, not of the same caste, not Indian, and I have an X wife. She has tried to convince them multiple times but they were just not having it. 

After some time of her trying to convince her parents, they decided that she should take a 2 week trip to India to visit them. I begged her not to go because it seemed like they were just trying to get her out of the US so they can keep her there. She wouldn't listen and assured me she would be back in 2 weeks. (Trip was from Feb 5 to Feb 18). 

We formulated a plan around this. She desperately wants her parents to accept us, and I also want them to accept because I do not want to have to tear her away from her family if it is not necessary. The plan is, because she was being moved to another contract in the US, she was going to spend 6 months working at this contract while still trying to convince her parents. If they would still not be convinced after 6 months, she would cut ties with them and elope with me. She told me that she wanted to be with me more than anyone and that she could never dream of an arranged marriage and being forced to spend the rest of her life with another guy whom she didn't love.

Fast forward to today, her parents and brother somehow found out of this plan, most likely by accessing and reading her emails. They now plan to keep her in India and not allow her to come back. I am desperately wanting her back here, I will do anything, including buying a ticket and going there to find her. She lives in Andhra Pradesh near Chittoor about 5 hours from Bangalore. Her parents have locked her in her house and taken away all forms of communication. If they keep her there, her visa will expire and she will not be able to return to the US. 

I am seeking your help r/India. What can I do to get my love back? She told me her parents are crazy to the point that they may kill her and then themselves. I cannot imagine my life without her and she cannot imagine her life without me. PLEASE HELP!

Edit: As recommended by a commenter, I have contacted lovecommandos.org and sent them a small fee for them to try and handle this. I do not know how this is going to end, and I REALLY appreciate all of your help and feedback. I now have another contact in Bangalore willing to help me thanks to a commenter here. Please continue to give me idea and suggestions. I will give anything and pay any cost to get her back here to the US.

Edit2: I am still waiting for Love Commandos' response. I will keep you all updated. If you have any other ideas please tell me. I am very tempted to go there but I am afraid to get arrested and put into jail.

Edit3: I just received a message from her brother. He told me never to contact her again and I have no chance because of my X. I am still waiting for a reply from Love Commanders.

Edit4: Here is a picture of us https://www.dropbox.com/s/yzygxrmc20b70d3/2013-01-20%2013.11.10-1.jpg
*Picture removed*

Edit5: Love Commandos told me that action should be taken tomorrow. Direct quote from them:
""We have already started taking up the matter at the highest level in Central, state and district administration and hopefully action may start/ take place today or tomorrow.
Authorities may also contact you if they need. Likewise your girl friend may also contact you in due course of process. Hoping to save your love and re uniting you. Pl have patience. As action has been officially initiated they may not be able to do any harm to her or move to any undisclosed place. Other senior authorities are likely to visit your girl friend tomorrow""

Edit6: No update yet as it is 4AM in India. I will keep you all updated. Please continue to provide feedback. I will take any help I can get and I will spare no cost to bring her back.

Edit7: Still no update and I am getting worried. At around 1:30AM EST Love Commandos emailed me and told me that they expect action by late evening and they will update me. It is now 8:20AM EST and 6:49PM IST and I have not received an email. I have sent them another email requesting for an update but there has been no reply. I want to go to India but if her parents have moved her I have no way of finding her. I am panicking I have no idea what to do next.

Edit8: I just received an email from Love Commandos: ""As per last update her voluntary statement may be got recorded tomorrow afternoon. It would be followed by a judicial statement.
The authorities or your girl friend may contact you after that process. As today was a working day, it is hoped that things speeded up.""
I am frustrated that there is no official word of what has happened. Maybe I am used to the US where if you call the police they are at your house within 30 minutes. I am planning to secure a same day Indian visa in NYC and fly there if I do not hear from her soon. Is there anyone willing to help me once I arrive? I have no idea how to navigate India. I would be flying into Bangalore airport most likely and if anyone, expecially anyone Telugu, is willing to come with me I would pay you and cover all your expenses. Please let me know.

Edit9: Last update at 6AM EST: "" LAST UPDATE JUST RECEIVED SAYS THAT HER VOLUNTARY STATEMENT IS BEING RECORDED. THINGS WOULD BE CLEAR LATER. IT ALL DEPENDS UPON HER STATEMENT NOW AND WHATEVER SHE WILL DESIRE THE AUTHORITIES WOULD DO ACCORDINGLY""
I am not sure I trust the police there, I hope that they gave her a chance to speak to them away from her parents. I do not know why this is taking so long.

Edit10: Love Commandos have asked me to wait until tomorrow (IST) for a response. If I still do not have a response, I will be going to India as soon as possible. I hope to be able to secure my visa same day and leave the next day. If anyone is willing to travel with me from Bangalore, especially if you can speak Telugu, PLEASE let me know. I will cover any expenses you have. Please message me here if you are willing to help. 

Edit11: I will not be going to India. She has just contacted me... her parents have made her get married. There is nothing I can do now. Thank you for all of your help. :-(

Edit12: Thank you to everyone that messaged me. Because of the large amount of people that refuse to believe I am American based on the way that my grammar is, here is photo verification: https://www.dropbox.com/s/tvls9oyu4qeqiyv/pic.jpg
As stated in my previous edit, she told me she is now married in my last conversation with her. Because of this, I have given up as there is nothing I can do. She told me that the day of her last communication, her parents relocated her to another city and she was married within 48 hours. When I questioned her if the police had knocked on her door she said that the police never visited her house asking for a statement, so I am not too happy with Love Commandos, but it is a moot point. That is the long and the short of it. Again, thank you to everyone that offered their advice and went out of their way to help. I don't wish this outcome on anyone and I hope India becomes more lax in regards to parents respecting the wishes of their children.",,False,self,t5_2qh1q,1360935133.0,,,True,t3_187vuz,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/187vuz/help_my_girlfriends_parents_have_her_under_house/,

1320168880.0,115,self.india,lwmnd,The ugly side of Metallica's Bangalore concert. ,booksaid,129,14,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/lwmnd/the_ugly_side_of_metallicas_bangalore_concert/,"I have taken this from a friend's facebook. 

The Metallica show was awesome. It gave a lot of people what they were waiting for. It even gave some folks new iPhones, MP3 players and laptops. A day later as I write this, the band’s gone, the crowd’s gone, our belongings are gone and all that remain are some horrifying memories of a night that should have been epic.

Prologue:

Most of the tickets booked on the last few weeks never got delivered to their owners. Instead, they bounced back and each fan was forced to go the venue to collect their passes. The security was so intense at the ticket counter on the day before the event that it took me 3 long hours to get hold of my pass and the queue was all of fifty people long! We thought DNA’s certainly learnt its lesson from the Delhi debacle.

What happened before the concert:

Gates open at 4:30 P.M. letting in an ocean of 25000 fans. Everyone is frisked at the main entrance, where fans are told that Backpacks are not allowed inside the venue. So, the folks travelling after the concert and others who’ve brought their backpacks to keep their belongings dry in the pouring rain, have no choice but to leave it at the ‘baggage counter’. Just like the secret ingredient in Mr. Ping’s noodle soup, The ‘baggage counter’ is NOTHING! There is no baggage counter. The master plan that DNA had cooked up left us fans gaping! They are instructed to leave their bags in an open ground (completely filled with mud), stacked one over the other. Out in the rain. Nothing to keep our belongings safe from the rain OR the muck. Left with no other option, fans decide to leave their belongings in the muck counter. Now comes the best part. DNA refuses to give tokens to the owners of the property, thereby escaping from additional responsibility and also destroying any chance of cataloging the items. So, all in all, the counter organized for the Metallica fans was an open ground right outside the main entrance. There were no records, no tokens, no security and no protection from the rain. And this was the infrastructure setup for fans paying 2750/- per ticket.

What happened after the concert:

Having left my backpack at the muck counter and being highly unsure about its safety, me and my friends got out early from the show. What we found at the muck counter was just an awe inspiring scene. Bags were strewn around on the ground, trampled over by fans as well as locals. What was happening was unclear, but after observing for a few minutes, we noticed some random men checking backpacks looking for heavy ones and waking away with them. Worse, little kids were opening the backpacks in situ and pulling out headphones, goggles and iPods out of bags and walking away. There was not a single cop stationed at the spot. One security guard was present, taking care of about one thousand bags and dealing with about the same number of exasperated people.

Now, the folks who went for the show and somehow managed to find their belongings probably already know this much. What happened next was something that only a few unfortunate folks had to experience.

What happened next:

Having unsuccessfully searched for our belongings for over 2 hours, about 100 fans realized that their stuff was just not there. We started looking at other possibilities. A couple of the fans waiting suddenly saw a guy picking up two backpacks, looking around and walking away with them. They chased him, caught him and brought him to the crowd, introducing him as the solution to our problem. Soon, angry fans spotted another guy doing the same, and caught him as well. The two gentlemen were turned over to the cops, who started shouting and swearing to the crowd about how they should not have brought their backpacks to the venue. The cops roughened up the suspects a bit and took them to the High Grounds police station, without a word to the stranded fans. No information was given about what was to happen to them, if a case would be registered or if our testimonies would be required. In the meantime, another fan spots a guy sneaking into an adjacent wedding hall with a backpack. A few people follow him into the hall and find a stash of 15 empty backpacks, all meticulously cleared of their contents. This is reported to the cops, who rush to the venue and instruct the hall personnel to lock down the hall from inside. Those of us who could understand Kannada made out the words “Your work’s done, now close the *ing door”, said by a cop to who seemed like the supervisor of the hall. Confused fans who now see some hope, start milling up in front of the wedding hall. The next part is the one that made our night. COPS WHIP OUT LATHI’s AND START BEATING UP THE CROWD. DOZENS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING GIRLS, ARE BEATEN UP AND CHASED OUT OF THE AREA. CHAOS FOLLOWS. Fans run from the venue and those who tried to talk calmly to the higher ranking cops were beaten up more. Adding insult to injury, the two suspects who were earlier taken to the police station were brought back and released right in front of the crowd. Unscathed and free to go, they go INTO the wedding hall and lock it again. We then went to the high Grounds police station, were we were informed that a complaint could not be lodged as it was ‘late at night’. The cops stated the reason that their superior was not present, and without him, a case could not be registered.

So there we were, lost in the middle of the night, a few tens of thousands rupees worth of belongings cheaper, having none to go to. DNA denied any responsibility. So did the cops. And to emphasize that point, they beat us up with lathis. Who’s going to return Anuj his laptop, external hard disk and 4 months’ worth of research notes? Who will return the couple from Malaysia their flight tickets, passports and money? What will happen to the iPods and iPhones that went missing? And what of the dozens of passports and ID cards? Frankly, we don’t know.

DNA will have to pay. So will the cops.

We will pursue the case with all we have. But well, we don’t know. Spread the word. This could've been you. ",,False,self,t5_2qh1q,False,,,True,t3_lwmnd,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/lwmnd/the_ugly_side_of_metallicas_bangalore_concert/,

[OC],sig-seg-me,138,21,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1clgdj/unsolicited_advice_for_job_seekers_and_employers/,"Unsolicited advice for job seekers and employers in the tech industry in India.

[Part 1]

Why am I posting this?
-----
I've been in the software industry for many years now. I've interviewed and been interviewed in all kinds of situations, and I regularly hear about other peoples experiences. I saw a few questions come up here and elsewhere about interviews, and I thought I can chip in with some advice. 

I see a lot of interview advice geared towards the west, but I don't see much about the scene in India. I want to create something specifically targeted towards developers in India because, in my opinion, there is a lot to interviews that varies across cultures - ranging from demeanor to dress code. I also see job seekers and employers making a few common mistakes, and I feel somewhat alarmed to see some things getting repeated so often that they are becoming almost cultural. So consider yourself warned: I do have an axe to grind.


Who is this for?
-----
You're one of these:

- A fresher (aka: new grad, fresh grad, NCG, etc )
- A mid-level lateral hire. Someone with &lt;=10 years of work experience looking to move.

Or, alternatively:

- An engineer interviewing people to join your mid-size (&lt; 1000 employees) company
- An engineer looking to hire for your startup

Or you are just curious about the process in general.

Prerequisites / Related work:
-----
There is a ton of information about interviews already available on the Internet. I don't want to repeat this corpus of information. I would recommend that you go through a few resources that I feel are important. Many of them seem to be pitched for a specific company, but I feel they are good advice in general

- Process: http://www.kchodorow.com/blog/2013/02/28/guide-to-tech-interviews/
- Content: http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html
- Questions and approaches: http://www.piexposed.com/
- Useful websites: Glassdoor, Career cup

Who is this NOT for?
-----
- You hate the software field but like the money, so you want to get into middle management. Please go look in a mirror and think about your life. You are the root cause of a lot of problems with the Indian IT industry.
- You cheated through your basic C programming course. Please go shoot yourself. You're part of the reason there's a negative stereotype about Indian developers.
- You work in roles other than design/development/QA. I know nothing outside these fields so please don't take my advice.
- You're a prodigy without a formal tech education - I honestly don't think the university degree matters, but I've never met one of you in person so I wouldn't be the right one to talk.

So, enough with the preamble. On to the more useful information:

Candidates:
-------
Here's the first thing you need to know: The concept of the 'interview process' is a myth. There's no single interview process. No one seems to have any clue why certain candidates get hired and some candidates get rejected. As an interviewer, if I had to rank candidates from 'good' to 'bad' I wouldn't know where to begin. The distinctions are very arbitrary and hiring decisions are very very subjective. Companies try to minimize this, but it's been proven that interviews seem to be no better than arbitrarily selecting people.

It's your job as a candidate to maximize your chances of being ranked 'good'. There are no shortcuts to achieve this: you need to be a good developer. There's no cheatsheet or magic list of things you need to know. 

**Fresh graduates:**


You are in college and it's time to look for a job. Here are a few things I would strongly recommend:
First off, understand that you are competing for a job. You will be compared against other candidates. Despite what your friends will tell you, there are no 'tricks' to getting hired. Your goal is to maximize your chances of getting hired, and considering how random hiring decisions are, the only thing you can do is to honestly and sincerely work on being a good developer.

- Don't be a rat in the rat race. This industry can be very enjoyable if you take time to cultivate and follow up on your interests. You may have to sneak time to do what you like to do while you do something else to earn money - sadly, that is the reality of the free market.

- Be curious! Why do you fall for the general rhetoric that liking your subjects is uncool? I find even the most minor things to be endlessly fascinating. (Seriously, why does a compiler think the ""#"" is a special symbol anyway? What the hell does ""little/big endian"" mean? What's so dynamic about dynamic programming??)
- Learn to use the Internet as a source of information, and not as a source of entertainment or a one-stop shop for solutions.
- Work on stuff in your spare time. For some reason, most colleges in India haven't embraced this concept, so most students come up with barren resumes. I would LOVE to see personal projects on your resume.
- [Edit: ] If you're a CS/IS student, or interested in algorithms in general, [Credit to /u/slumdawggg] solve problems on [codechef](http://codechef.com), [Sphere Online Judge](http://www.spoj.com/),[TopCoder](http://topcoder.com), [Interview Street](http://InterviewStreet.com). Another helpful site is [Geeks For Geeks](http://geeksforgeeks.org). [Credit to /u/one_brown_jedi] And [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net).
- Are you an Engineer? Do you know what that means? Do you _want_ to build things? If so, why aren't you building them?
- Whatever field you are in, DO NOT specialize too early. Software guy? Learn python, C++ AND Scala, instead of one giant kick-ass project in Scala. Hardware girl? Work on embedded systems alongside your Verilog behemoth. Systems ninja? Learn a bunch of simulations and topologies, or learn to build an Android app. Get your hands dirty with different things! I hate seeing a girl from college who is an expert in MATLAB but can't explain why it's not used everywhere. You're wasting your potential. Your professors will tell you to be an expert in one thing, but you need to understand the ecosystem you exist in before you can specialize.
- Join student organizations that are involved in tech. Your college probably has an IEEE or ACM student branch. Perhaps there's an LUG nearby. Maybe a few friends are building an app for your college fest. Whatever, just get involved in tech in an organization.
- Do an internship if you can. The benefits should be obvious, and you might earn some money as well.
- Keep an updated resume at all times after your 2nd year. Get your resume reviewed by many people. Check if members of your faculty have industry experience. Hit up your seniors who are in companies. Maintain a personal website perhaps.
- Don't have a ""dream job"" or a ""dream company"". There's no such thing. You may think that your life will be incredible if you join $company but chances are it'll be just as good in many, many other places. Companies are made of people just like you.
- Don't plan to be a job hopper. Loyalty may be underrated, but there is great personal growth to be had in staying in one job long enough to make a positive impact on the industry.
- Don't be cynical. Your peers will tell you that ""No good work happens in India"" or ""IT jobs here are just people who cut paste code"" or ""It's just a software coolie position"". I can go on for hours with detailed examples about why they are wrong, but the fact is that the work is pretty good and it pays well.
- DO NOT LIE AND CHEAT your way through college.
- Try to cultivate non-technical interests as well. You're going to be cooped up in a cubicle farm for months on end with a bunch of people. Would you rather be with a group filled with bookish nerds? Or in a group that has smart people who happen to play mridangam/take photographs/go dancing?
- Learn to talk to strangers about yourself and technology. The hardest thing to do in an interview is to walk in and be ""on"" immediately. Especially in India, where you're not likely to talk about your work to anyone except people you are very comfortable with, it can be quite hard to be friendly with strangers. 
- Seek out smart people among your peers or teachers/juniors/seniors/relatives and cultivate relationships with them. You know all the sports guys hang out with other sports guys, right? Why are you not trying to find people in college who want to work on fun stuff? Do they not exist? 
- Learn to function in a team. What does this mean at your level? Basically, learn these things:
   * Learn to make time commitments and keep them
   * Learn to listen to your team mates and help them out 
   * Learn to ask for help where appropriate 
   * Learn to describe your work clearly and concisely
   * Learn to be impersonal: There is a world of difference between ""Why didn't you do it this way?"" vs ""Would this way also work?""
   * Learn to manage your time well (really, a to-do list that you track regularly is all it takes)   
   * Learn to deal with people who don't do any of the things above (this can be the absolute hardest. It was for me.)
   * Learn to take feedback (solicited or unsolicited) without getting riled up about it.
   * Learn to separate your 'professional' connection from your 'personal' connection. If you end up doing all your projects with the girl/guy you're dating or your roommate, chances are you have no idea of how to work with strangers.

  You probably notice that ""team work"" basically means ""be a good person"". Well, yes. Unfortunately, we don't learn many of these skills from our parents and friends. The somewhat hierarchical nature of our personal lives does not mesh well with corporate teams where everyone is a peer but does not necessarily share a personal connection. However, the things on top should help you go a long, long way. Work in teams in college where possible, and don't stick to the same team forever.

I posted regularly to understand what r/India redditors were like, enjoyed a few posts, and was glad to have become a regular on the subreddit.
Until about 6 months into this, people like lolguard (who did most of what Envia mentioned even to me) and a few others, started ""stalking"" me, using every post to figure out my real identity, making comments about my profession, making me very uncomfortable and disappointed in this subreddit.
Where I thought, I would be able to make a difference, get opinions, maybe change views or have them changed, join hands with like minded people to make a better India, just turned out to be another place where a few assholes reside for ""cheap thrills', ruining a forum that could be made into a possible country changing one, into a local bus stand in Old delhi, where you are constantly ogled, harassed and whistled at and have to be very careful of gropers!
It saddens me that even in a world like reddit, some people will go to great lengths to show how they have NO civic sense and are so immature and attention starved they are and ruin a good experience for everyone! It's like the assholes who have a loud conversation on their mobile phones in theaters, during a movie! It's disgusting and humiliating to know that these are people from our own culture!
I have stopped posting here and having seen the quality of posts and redditors who frequent the subreddit, did not intend to post at all but, after reading Envia's comment to ""asshole"", I thought I might make a plea to all you people on r/india who think it's fun to ruin this forum with your shit..

I understand your need for cheap thrills and idiot antics, but PLEASE do not do it on r/india! Create another subreddit where you can do all of this, with your own moderation and leave r/india alone, so that this can truly be what it is, a forum for India, not disgusting perverts and assholes.
Leave r/india to be a place where sensible, like minded people share views that work for the betterment of the country and it's people, rather than the joke that it is close to becoming..

You wax eloquent about the complex sentence structure in Narcopolis, the lucid zephyr-like words of R. K. Narayan, and the absolute bullshittery in *Champak*!

You had opinions on every Indian story - Arundhathi Roy's, Jhumpa Lahiri's, Khushwant Singh's, the stories in your Gulmohar reader, Tinkle, etc. At some point, probably in the early angst-ridden teenage years, you put pen to paper and let the ink express your feelings. You showed your diary, and later on, your blog, to a few friends and family. They read your dark poems, your happy poems, your funny road rage incidents, your short stories with a twist, your stick drawing reviews of movies, your first serious attempt at playwriting, your first love poem to that girl who everyone else thought was ugly in class and you were optimistic that your chances were quite good because of that, and told you that you had talent. 

""But, beta,"" aunty said, ""first get off that engineering degree, and do whatever you want. Of course, you also have to get married and all, na? Then you can do this writing-titing. Okay?""

So you hung your towel to dry, got focused on engineering/medicine/CA/life, and now get dressed in the morning, staring at the mirror, shirting, panting, tying and dying, and wondering where you lost that zing thing, that once Gold Spot in your life. You wonder if you still have it in you. You ask yourself in the shower what would someone think if they read that one blog post that you recently wrote, and edited a dozen times. You want to know if your collection of short stories are worth their weight in Kerala bridal gold. Goddamit, you are the hidden Pico Iyer, the unknown Vasco de Gama, no, de Alpha, who has sailed and discovered many beautiful lands of words, and you JUST. DON'T. KNOW. WHAT. TO. DO. NEXT!

Well, worry no more, friend. We, at /r/indianwriters are here to precisely talk about these things, and more. When a group of (pretty serious) writers found ourselves without a voice on the Pangea of a writing sub, /r/writing, we decided to form our own little Ceylon, a small tropical writing paradise strictly for writers from india/writers who write about india/heck, anything loosely connected with India and writing (Yes! Editors, we love you too.)

We love the mayuric usage of the English language, the veritable Carnival-esque parade of words and flowery phrases, begged, borrowed and wordnapped from Indian languages, and strung together like a wedding garland. Some of us are serious writers. Some of us are serious amateurs. Some of us are just serious, but love to read! 

We talk about vernacular usage, author styles, publishing prospects, story arcs, the whole nine Kanchipuram silk yards! We want to invite you budding authoresses and authors, you regal kings and queens of Reynolds, you magnificent Facebook status-smiths, you one line twitterati zing-slingers, you lovers of the English language, and even you casual cotton candy sellers in this pantheon of high art. Come to /r/indianwriters , talk about writing, show us your work, and engage in a literary full-meals buffet!

**TL;DR**: /r/indianwriters is a new sub for indian writers.

EDIT: For the love of all thing Holi, please don't down vote this. It's alright if you thought this post came out as prissy or pretentious, but, really, we want more people to come over and participate.

What a week its been for the mod team over here!!! 

With whatever has happened aside, I would like to discuss few important updates [relevant to the entire drama week]

**Comment score hiding**

This is not going to be implemented. The results of the informal poll set up by our fellow mod /u/rahulthewall is very clearly against it. I also agree to the fact that a discussion should have been had regarding this before implementation and experimentation. Apologies to the community on the slip up.

But surprising fact in the poll was how close it was and how many people actually supported it.

*****

**Banning**

We haven't banned anyone for ages as we haven't seen any major transgressions against the community policy [Available in wiki] by anyone. Wherever there were serial offenders going about their business with complete disregard for the very minimal rule set we have, we removed the content and exercised a fair amount of discretion and have let several submissions through which were against rules also [Sometimes by mistake, sometimes intentionally]. 

**We are not banning anyone as of now** Personally I don't believe this works well with the current Reddit love for anonymity. Even in the worst case scenario, a dedicated troll will go ahead and keep creating multiple accounts and an IP banning will never work in India considering the fact that most of us are connected to Dynamic IPs. 

*****

**Mod Policy**

Pretty much most of the moderation is in a Laissez-faire attitude over here except on couple of instances where we had to deal with users like /u/lungilungi and /u/wakthoo where we had to use certain amount of discretion in handling the situation [Discretion over and above our rule set] The situation warranted an exceptional measure and I believe we handled it as it was required. 

Apart from these instances, I don't think the mods have transgressed in the way /r/india works much. There were 2 other drama threads regarding a link removed by one of our mods. Generic content is a pretty grey area sometimes and we do take calls which are pretty unpopular. This is to ensure that there is no Karma whoring rather than with any other malafide intention. 

For a more moderated version of a community related to India, you can always visit /r/bharat.

*****

**Way ahead**

There is no change in any community policy as of now. We'll try and keep /r/india as free as required from direct moderation. This may change later and we would keep you sufficiently informed and would not pull a fast one. 

*****

**Changes in the mod team**

Contrary to the popular opinion, our new mods Reddictor and Kabuliwallah have voluntarily left due to their own personal reasons. [Edit: Reddictor may join us at a later time]

We would have a mod election shortly. This election is more to understand who is interested in the community's well being rather than who is more popular. So the final discretion of the selection of the new mods will be still with us. There will be a separate thread with the eligibility criteria posted within this week. So watch out for it and do participate.

*****

Having been here since its inception, I have had personally very high hopes of having this community stand apart from every other community representing India in the inter-webs. Now, not so much :( The negativity is overwhelming. I hope, we can still stand apart and contribute something positive to our country from this community. 

A request to all our community members. Do make this place a place you would want to come back to, rather than run away from.",,False,self,t5_2qh1q,1375809667.0,,,True,t3_1jtfhf,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1jtfhf/meta_updates_regarding_comment_score_hiding/,moderator

To see his update about the rejection, [check here](http://www.ziggysgames.com/samsung-app-store-rejects-neil-rajah-because-hes-partially-clothed)

&gt; So I signed up, submitted the game, and waited. They rejected the game on 31 counts. 30 of those boiled down to 2 bugs that they reproduced across multiple devices. I’ve fixed those bugs. But the final issue was the most interesting one:

&gt; ""Due to the local moral values or laws, content containing partially clothed, bikini or lingerie is not allowed in following countries: Algeria, Bahrain, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Yemen, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Nordic countries (Norway, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden), Philippines""

I am just thankful that India is not on the list. 

It does unsaid that you can download the game to support a redditor, and help fight censorship! I have no affiliation with the maker or Samsung or Rama. However, I made this post just because I found it interesting, and it has some relevance to India too.

Reginald E.H Dyer, the man responsible for Jallianwala Bagh massacre, on hearing that there was a meeting of about 15,000 people including women, children and elderly, went with a group of riflemen and fired on the gathering. He continued firing until ammunition was exhausted. 

The Indian National Congress estimate that about 1500 were injured and almost a 1000 people were killed. That included women and children. It was an outrageous act, the crowd was an innocent group of religious persons trying to practice their religion. They were unarmed and it is an act of cowardice to attack an unarmed person.

**Reactions**

Winston Churchill described it as ""monstrous"" and many British officials openly condemned it.

Sir Rabindranath Tagore gave up his knighthood in protest.


""I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself."" — Dyer's response to the [Hunter Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre#aftermath) Enquiry.

I'm posting this here hoping that you guys will ""get it"" better than anywhere else on reddit. I'm a 32 year-old male, born and raised in the south in a moderate family. My parents and I are very different - they are traditional, conservative, religious and my sibling and I mean the world to them. I'm very liberal, an atheist and very ""individualistic"". I've been living in the US for about a decade, and although my parents think that's what poisoned my mind with ideas of individualism, that's not true - I've always been this way.


All my friends who I grew up with are married (many with children) as of now. My parents think that I'm already three years too late, but I don't want to get married just yet. My parents' ideal version of me would happily let them find a bride (who belongs to the same caste, of course), go to India for a ""vacation"", meet the girl and ""get engaged"", come back to the US, chat/talk to her for a few months ""getting to know each other"", go back to India and get married - which admittedly is not very different from what many of my friends did. However, I cannot bring myself to do this.


I don't have a girlfriend now - so it's not that I'm against arranged marriage BECAUSE I have someone in mind. I just don't find myself at a point in my life to make as huge a commitment as marriage. We've had many arguments in the past, and my parents think they're doing me a huge favor when they say ""Fine, find a girl yourself (as long as she is Indian)"", but my point is that marriage is such a big deal that before everything else, I should be ready for it and the readiness should come from within myself. I hope I'm not painting a demonic picture of my parents, because that would be very far from the truth. They are actually very polite and sound helpless (""Look at me, don't you see how much I love you? Don't you see how much I'm suffering because you won't get married? All I want is for you to be happy!"") Sometimes I wish they were rude and trying to force their ideas upon me, because then I could simply tell them to fuck off.


That being said, this post is not about how to deal with them or how to make them understand. We've already hit an impasse and have agreed to disagree. What triggered this post was the death of a relative, who was younger and healthier than my father. I know that my parents are growing old and not in their best health lately. Sometimes I feel as if I should just do what they want me to do even though I detest it will all my being, because I won't be able to forgive myself if, god forbid, something happens to them before I fulfill their wishes. Sometimes I feel differently - this is my life, I and only I should have any say in when or whom I get married to, and while it is sad that my parents don't agree, it's not really my fault. I'm torn and don't know what to do - this may be the biggest dilemma I've ever faced in my life.


Have any of you gone through something similar? Any thoughts or advice? I hope I don't get responses like ""Dude, do what you want, it's your life!"", because unfortunately, it's not that simple and who can understand better if not r/india? :)",,False,self,t5_2qh1q,False,,,True,t3_lr0mm,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/lr0mm/parents_want_me_to_get_married_i_dont_want_to/,

Some days I love the city, and most days I'm finding that I get fucking irritated by it. Not anything to do with the the pollution, traffic, crowds, power issues or any of those creature comforts. But after 2.5 years, I've become increasingly sensitive to the fact that people will ALWAYS see me as an outsider.

I know it's topic that's been beaten and re-beaten to death a hundred times - Delhi is rough city, people stare, the North is like that, Delhi men are like that. I'm fine with staring but I get bloody irritated when people invade my space and sense of security, like the many men who have slowed down their cars alongside me and asked me inside while I was walking down the street in South Delhi, or even the more persistent ones who one time offered me money and stalked me down the block for a while, at night. Or the ones who have groped me on the sidewalk in Old Delhi. It's fucking scary, and fucking irritating!
 
Yes, I'm considering getting a car so I don't have to be reliant on public transportation and out exposed to these sorts of things as much. But now there's issues that spill onto the internet - just today I realized I had a persistent Twitter follower who has been ONLY responding to me and a few other foreign women living in India for the last several months. Many of his Tweets were quite disparaging, talking about how ugly I looked in a picture, how bad my new website looked, etc. That, or he was hitting on me. What the fuck? 

I also had some genius try to pose as another foreign woman who had come to Mumbai to live and 'befriended' me. I figured out it was a fake when I realized they were ONLY Tweeting me, and when they referred to motherfucking Idaho as the ""west coast."" When I did a reverse image search I found out the avatar was a stolen picture of some woman in Chicago. Again, What. The. Fuck. 
 
I don't think this is just an issue for foreign women, I know Indian women have problems in Delhi as well. But I feel like I get typecasted as a clueless tourist or prostitute more often than not (even though I DO NOT dress 'revealingly' nor like a wandering hippie).

So, real talk: is this shit ever going to end? Is India capable of having minority/foreign populations living here and peacefully co-existing? People go on about India's great diversity, but that's mostly with groups that have always geographically existed here. Some days I don't think it's getting better, only worse. Even Africans and Asians (or even Northeasterners) have their own sets of problems, many worse/more racially driven than my own.

I started off my journey on 8th Nov and am back on 18th Nov, didn't have internet access so couldn't post earlier.

There were special Pakistani Railways (chair car) trains arranged by SGPC which started from Amritsar around 11AM, two hour custom clearances on both borders, we reached at midnight in Nankana Sahib. 
At Atari border, they gave us only 2000 Paki rupees and rest in dollars( I guess for the economical reasons). I took 1500 dollars and 2000 Pakistani Rupees.

People welcomed us, local district police personal came to greet us. We were given three level security, guards were with us all the times. Our visit was limited to Pakistan's Punjab State. We went to places like
Nankana Sahib, Sacha Sauda, Punja Sahib (Hasanabdal - close to rawalpindi), Kartar pur (gurdwara which you can see with doorbin from BSF post at Dera Baba Nanak) and last three days in Lahore. Lahore is an awesome place, saw MahaRaja Ranjeet Singh's places, mughal forts etc.

People there were very good, bahut izzat di, they will offer you free drinks , free food and what not. 'Sardar Sahib, Sardar Sahib, was very nice to hear. I feel non-political people don't hate indians at all, they love us. 
Because of the security concern we were not allowed to visit anyone's home, otherwise my Dad and Grand dad has given me places I can visit, my Grand dad came to Indian from Rawalpindi after partition. 

I brought back some dry fruits because they were comparatively cheap, I also brought punjabi suits which had nicekarachi karai. Brought some Pajama kurtas too.

These people were really nice, may be because they were Punjabis.

Other things I noticed was that Pakistan has a lot of poverty, most of the people I have spoken to have more than 4 children. Unlike Indian north there is no lack of women, women are extremely beautiful, some wear burqa's some doesn't. Lahore was pretty liberal and was a sight of very pretty women. 

Sorry my English is not so very good and I am writing from a cyber cafe as of now and writing in a hurry, you can ask me anything though.

EDIT: some coverage from Pakistani Media and pics http://tribune.com.pk/multimedia/slideshows/289257/

EDIT: I met a lot of Punjabis who were sikhs (pre-independence but converted to Muslims after partition) but didn't change their names. Sir names as Virk, Kahlon, Randhawa were common on Muslims. One guy at shop gave me a free SIM without asking anything, he gave me a hug I won't forget, it got me tears in my eyes later that night.

The Story.",PlsDontBraidMyBeard,114,18,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/11mvqn/as_requested_i_got_beaten_up_by_the_son_of_an_mla/,"It happened back in 2004, I had just returned from the Gelf after finishing my Intermediate. Joined a degree college in my home town. I was super excited on the prospects of finally going to a college where there is co-education because schools in the gulf were always separate during my time. Looking back, I can't help but chuckle at the crazy stories involving women that my cousins told me in those initial few weeks and the fact that I believed everything. 


I was in first year B.Com when it happened. My parents had stayed back in the gulf and I was here in India under the supervision of an extended family. They didn't bother me much so I was under the influence of new found freedom.


Two months had passed, I had my own little group of friends but had utterly and miserably failed with women. Then *she* came. She will henceforth be referred to as Girl_A. Looking back, I can now only describe her as 'foxy'. A new maal bandi had joined our class and in my early adulthood wisdom, I was smitten by her looks and the way she carried herself. You know how sometimes one female partners up with another female and are always together? Well, the girl she became besht friends with was already a good friend of mine (Girl_B) and I told her how I felt about the new girl.


It is important to also introduce my good friends at the time, Friend_A and Friend_B. We lived in the same neighbourhood and attended/bunked college together for the next 3 years. Friend_B's father had a Maruti Suzuki Zen, and we would try to get him to bring the car, which for us, at the time was a very big deal. 


Moving on, Girl_B had done her job and one fine Tuesday, Me, Friend_A, Friend_B, Girl_A, Girl_B and Girl_B's sister sit all packed up in our Zen and go see a movie. I think the movie was 'Deewane Hue Pagal'. Things were going kinda okay with Girl_A and we had the whole day planned out. I was standing in queue for the tickets and that's when the first warning came.


A guy from my college who I had never really spoken to much comes up to me and says with a smug smile 'You shouldn't have brought her here'. I ignored him and Friend_A asked him to mind his own business. He whips out his cellphone and walks away. We go watch the movie, we're having a good time, I mentally congratulate myself for choosing to come to India and are on our way back to the parking lot and we see that our dear Zen was surrounded by 15-20 guys.


It was actually Friend_A and Friend_B who first realized that we were in trouble. I had no idea that something like this could happen and didn't have the slightest clue of what was going on. My initial thoughts were that Friend_A or Friend_B's friends has spotted his car and were waiting for him. I was asked to stay with the girls while they went and talked. 


Three guys each put their arms around both my friends and walked them away from the car in different directions. Me and the girls are still not concerned and are just standing and chatting. Enter Son_of_MLA. Slimey fellow goes straight for Girl_A and politely asks her to leave. Girl_A says something along the lines of 'You have no right to tell me what to do any more'. I am standing there confused looking like an idiot. The girls make for the car and I follow them. Girl_A also seems to be joining us. I still have no idea what is going on. Son_of_MLA seems to be whispering something to Girl_A at this point but she seems pissed. I see Friend_A and Friend_B coming back to the car and signalling us to get inside. Friend_B opens the car and gets into the driver's seat. Girl_B and Girl_B's sister enter the back. I wait for Girl_A to enter before I stuff myself in at the back. But just as she was about to enter, Son_of_MLA grabs her wrist and drags her away shouting 'YOU ARE NOT GOING WITH THEM'. You'd expect me to lose my shit right about now, but no, that didn't happen. As if I were trying to break a fight between two kinder-gardeners, I stand between them and remove Son_of_MLA's grip from girl's hand. Bad move.


I was sucker-slapped 5-6 times. My beloved Friends A and B were dragged out. Some guy head-butted me to the ground. While on the floor, I think I saw Friend_B go down too. I could hear the screams of the girls. Nothing was happening to them, they were reacting to what was happening to us. Some kicks and some more slaps. It didn't hurt much, but the pride and ego were screaming out profanities. Then a familiar face of some other guy from college shows up. He stuffs me and my friends into our car and keeps repeating that we should leave. I meet eyes with Girl_A to check on her, she's getting into an auto. Thankfully, alone. She tells me that she'll join us later and everyone around us is screaming at us to leave. We comply and drive away. We stop a few kilometres later to do a damage report. That's when my friend told me that Son_of_MLA was in fact, the son of an MLA and Girl_A and him had broken up quite recently.


I wish I could say that it ended there, but there's more to it. Will write it down shortly.


Part 2


So we drop Girl_B and her sister back at their home. I receive a text from Girl_A stating that she's ok  and is very sorry for what just happened and at this point I choose not to respond because I am still reeling from whatever the fuck just happened. On our drive back to the neighbourhood, we're mostly quiet except for this hurtful conversation:


Friend_A: Tu ch_tiya hai baap! *You are an idiot!*


Me: Main ch_tiya hun? *What?*


Friend_B: Teku bola tha chup chap gaadi main jaane ko. Kya zaroorat thi beech main padne ki? *We had signalled you to get in the car, why did you have to interfere?*


Friend_A: Poore college ko pata hogaya hoga ab tak ke humne apni phutwali hai. *Probably, the entire college knows by now that we got thrashed.*


*Silence*


I chose not to speak because those friends also had an advisory role through out those initial few days in India. I was too freaked out to care, anyway. I reach home, have lunch and sleep. 


At around 6pm I get a call from Friend_B stating that we're being hunted. Apparently, Friend_B got a call from his cousin asking him why there were Son_of_MLA's guys going around asking about him. Before I could process this new information, Friend_B instructed me to come outside my house in 5 minutes. I comply cause I am a little too scared to think on my own. We go to Friend_A's house and the three of us ride on a bike to Friend_B's cousin's place. The_Cousin calmly debriefs us and then we ask him for advice. He suggests that we go to Son_of_MLA's house and apologize. 'Apologize for what? They're the ones who thrashed us for no reason!'. The_Cousin looks at me and says 'Tu OP hai na?' *You must be OP!'*. Friend_B asks me to shut up and listen quietly. The_Cousin calls up Son_of_MLA and arranges for a meet near a cricket ground in his neighbourhood at around 9pm. Until this point, my understanding of India was limited to what I had seen in Bollywood and the experiences/instructions of my cousins. I decide against informing my caretakers and just go with it. We reach the rendezvous point at 8.30pm with The_Cousin.


The ground seemed awfully dark and deserted. After we parked, a Maruti Esteem full of henchmen from earlier that day pulled over and asked us to get inside the ground. After we did, they reversed their car into Friend_B's bike. They yelled out a 'SORRY"" and guffawed away into the night. Son_of_MLA walks in with a smug smile on his face.


He looks at Friend_A, 'Tu Friend_A hai na, Friend_A_Dad ka ladka, ___school main pada, ___se intermediate kara aur ___ colony main rehta aur tere 2 bhai aur 1 behen hai, na?' *You are Friend_A, you are Friend_A_Dad's son and you've studied in these ___schools and college. You also have 1 sister and 2 brothers and you live in ___ colony?'*

Friend_A nods in affirmation.


Then he turn to me and gives a 'Tell us something about you' answer on my behalf and the process repeats with Friend_B.


I guess the aim of telling us information about us to ourselves was his way of trying to intimidate us. It kind of worked. By this point, the guys in the Esteem were just circling around the ground  uttering gibberish noisily. 


The_Cousin steps in with the predictable 'Bache hai, jaanedo' *They're kids, let them go.* To which Son_of_MLA says 'Tu meri jagah pe hota toh jaane deta kya?' *Would you have let them go if you were in my place?*. They step away from us and 'discuss' stuff. Eventually, Son_of_MLA asks us to apologize which we do in unison and claims that he is letting us go just because of The_Cousin. 


Epilogue:

That entire year we ended up becoming the bitches of The_Cousin. Meaning, we had to pay for his meals whenever he wanted us to, out of respect for his intervention. Thankfully, he left the country soon and has left our lives.


The incident shot us to fame in our college. Opinion was divided whether we were too stupid and naive or just well connected. We were randomly asked about it for about a week or two, but then people moved on.


Girl_A stopped coming to college after that incident. I told myself that I didn't want to talk to her because she had lied to me about a few things. In truth, I think it was because I was too scared to get involved in this kind of mess again. She broke communications from everyone and hasn't been heard from since.

Things you should keep: Chillispray/Pepperspray

1. Guy tried to scare you: Spray chillispray over his eyes.
2. Guy on a bike follows you while you are speaking on the phone: Scream out the numbers on his number plate.
3. Guy following on bike: Take out your phone and take (or atleast pretend to take a picture of him or his number plate)
4. Guy follows you on foot: Take out your chillispray.
5. [VERY IMPORTANT] Be confident. Don't lead them on. Don't ignore the ones that may cause harm. Don't let them think you are weak. Make noise and let someone around know. Better paranoid than dead.

Remember: Some guys will tease you no matter what you wear. Be confident and reach your destination.

I promise, you'll see enough potential in them. Here's [a set on soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kabervasuki/sets/one) and [a video of me performing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFwm1ddi9KE) a few months back. 

I don't have a band and I need musicians who can play an instrument (any instrument) decently to jam with and take my music somewhere.

Said musicians should be people who are open to experimenting and developing songs I've written with me as well as new material.  

I'm kind of upset to say that my offline attempts have been a failure so far because I can't find people who are not metal heads AND understand tamil / want to play in a tamil band. 

Ideally I'd like to people who can spare at least 6 hours a week and live in Chennai. 

Know anyone or someone who might know someone - anything man. I'm kind of pumped up at the moment... Help!

UPDATE (12:47AM AUG 6): I just got off a call with someone who contacted me after seeing this. It seems really promising. REALLY promising. I'll be meeting him sometime this week.

Waiting till you are 30 years old to 'get married' and then be with a woman goes against every natural urge a guy has since he hit puberty. Sex until marriage is a crime against nature. 

Rape is a terrible thing, and I abhor these fuckheads for doing what they did, but if you want to get at the root of the problem, adding CCTV cameras around Delhi is not going to solve it; It might sound 'crazy', but dudes just need to get laid every so often!!! And in India this aint happenin enough for young guys.

This is 2012 people, give women free reign over their sexuality by NOT demonizing them if they like a guy and, god forbid!, she decides to date him! Provide free (or at least very cheap) contraception, pay women equally so they do not feel inferior and dependent, and MOST importantly, make prostitution legal and regulate it!! We guys love the ladies and just wanna get a little!! And not just when we turn 30, Damn! Indian men have been suppressed for too long, its hurting our society, our country.....and our balls, haha!

- Not using turn signals
- Trying to get on to public transport before people have gotten off.
- How people treat servants/waiters
- Taking one's sweet time walking across a busy walkway
- Littering
- Pooping in public restrooms and not flushing
- Driving on high beam
- holding a door for a stranger and not being acknowledged in any way whatsoever.

So I decide to get my hair cut in India, after being there for about 1 month.  I don't know much of the city, Hyderabad; however, know enough to hire a auto-rickshaw and give him destinations to get around.  I'm doing some shopping, getting some pictures developed (I know, non-digital camera, I was poor back then and HCL didn't give me a stipend yet)



I see a typical barber shop - chairs, equipment, someone is being shaved so I head in and wait to be seated.  I don't speak Hindi, or telgu so I'm just communicating with gestures and nods.  I sit down and expect some electric shaver or something, but the old wrinkled Indian man with lots of character just starts in with the scissors - *shingshingshing* rapidly!  Really fast, my hair is flying everywhere and he is doing a great job!  It is amazing and I'm looking out onto the street and taking in all the sights and sounds of the busy city, and am really enjoying this small event.  Then...



Then I get slapped up side the head - and again!  *Whap* *Whap*  *whapwhapwhap*  Bends my neck this way and that - OUCH!!! WTF!!!??? This continues for some time, and I can't speak the language so I don't know what is happening.  After I while realize its some type of massage, and after the initial shock of being ""beaten"" I endure it and then the haircut event is over.  I realized that this was kind of typical, and while I was not injured, I was very surprised to say the least that I thought I was being abused ;)



One of the best haircuts I've ever gotten; and the massage actually felt good afterwards...



So, that is my short funny story – would love to hear some other non-Indians, or from Indians who have funny foreigner s stories.

 the Sir Creek dispute, but that now ""the mood in Pakistan is 
 too self-absorbed to work on it."" On Siachen, he reported 
 that the Indian Army has drawn a line with its political 
 leadership. It has told the GOI that withdrawal was 
 tantamount to ceding the area to Pakistan due to the 
 difficulty of retaking it should Pakistan occupy it. 
 Instead, the GOI is attempting to ""soften"" the issue by 
 proposing joint military projects such as environmental clean  up or trekking. There has been no Pakistani response to  these suggestions, he noted.

I am merely stating what I have observed and what I have concluded based on these observations. For this is the unvarnished truth. And India cannot palate the truth.*

Socrates, the father of Western thought, often spoke of a concept called Thumos. Thumos was very much a Greek concept. An abstract concept that held many meanings and translations. However, this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in English. The essence of ‘Thumos’ can probably be summed up by the saying – “When making a decision, a man is faced with two choices. An easy path and a tough path. The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization"". And it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak. Taking the tougher road is an informed decision, for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path. He has to consciously take the tougher path, and avoid the easy. However, a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be. Retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task. Most men do not make it. India too, is at this cross roads today. And we might not make it.

It is indeed, ironic then, that I started this essay about the decline of ‘Indian civilization’ with a concept borrowed from the West. This is not to show that Indian philosophy has not reached the high levels of thought to have such a concept, but to merely show how far we have strayed from it.  Make no such mistake. For the Vedas, the ultimate repository of Indian philosophy, were written long, long before Socrates’ ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment. We had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs, long before Socrates even had his first coherent thought. All Socrates did then, was re-discover what we had already known. We were superior in all respects. And it is in this very attitude, that lies the seed of our destruction. How many times have you heard your elders say – “Indian culture is the best. Anything associated with the West is bad!”. I hear it all the time. It is a constant din in our ears. Anything associated with the West is decadent and immoral and inferior. And Indian culture is superior to every other culture, past, present and future. Well then, superior in exactly what manner?? Few, if any, gave a concrete answer to this question. If they gave an answer at all.

The most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions. How then are we superior? IF we are superior at all?  Let us look around the world today and ask ourselves, “How many of the concepts, ideas, and objects that I use in my daily life on a day-to-day basis emerged from purely indigenous sources?” I asked myself this question many times, over and over again.  The conclusion was the same everytime. None. To further clarify this point, let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely Oriental origin. Gunpowder. And this too was taken up and advanced by the West. If the Chinese invented Gunpowder, it was the West that developed the cannons that used them. Indeed, there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past.  And as all of us have seen, we revere the past. It is drummed into us in our schools, in our universities, in our families and at the dinner table. Indian culture always was and is, miles ahead of the decadent and corrupt influences of the West. It is not. This assertion is nothing but an inferiority complex. And an aversion to the truth.

It is important to realize that I am not saying that India or Indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication. It is not a fabrication. We were indeed a highly advanced civilization, and a highly cultured one at that. But we were, and not are. What we are now is a mish mash of cultures that does not know where it is headed.

How did we then fall so low? How did we, we who had reached highs that even now are only dreamt of, fall to the very depths from where these highs are unimaginable? It is tempting to blame the West, colonialism, British rule and all that. But the problem lies much deeper than that.

Every empire is built on one strength. One strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate. The Roman empire was built on the discipline of its Legions. Most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the Roman Legion made it a formidable attacking force.  The British Empire was built on the strength of the trade links between Britain, a small insignificant island, and its vast territorial holdings in every corner of this planet. The dominant empire today is the USA. This empire is a little different. For its strength stems from its culture. Right from Hollywood, to sitcoms, our thought processes and ideas, to even what we eat and wear, it is the cultural power of the USA in full show. Every empire in history has had its one strength. And India too had a cultural empire similar to what the USA has today. A thousand years ago, students flocked from all over the world to study at Nalanda and Taxila. Just as they flock to the USA today. Great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought. Religions, philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls. Just as they are being established in the USA today. However, all empires must fall. The Roman empire fell when the discipline of its legions eroded. The British empire fell when its trade links could no longer be kept captive to serve them alone. The cultural empire of the USA is ripe to fall even as I write this. And the Indian empire has already fallen. A thousand years ago India was the USA of the age. Not any more. Today this cultural empire has eroded until all we have left is a kind of cultural hubris. And hubris, as we all know, is a fine quality. Often found in those who perish from it.

The strength of Indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas. And a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas. Today however, we have neither the openness to new ideas, nor the will to work hard. Take for example the resistance to ‘Westernization’. Does it not speak of a reluctance to embrace new ideas and concepts? This hardening of opinions and closing of minds is prevalent not only in resisting outside influences and ‘preserving Indian culture’, but also in every detail of our lives. A teacher in India does not like it if his student questions him. For in that question, lies the seed of a new idea. And in that seed, lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong. And that is why we Indians do not like someone who asks too many questions, as I found out to my cost when I questioned India’s supposed cultural superiority.

A far more dangerous symptom however, is our instinctive reluctance to work hard for what we want. Our instinctive impulse to take a shortcut. Our instinctive reflex to take the easy road. Here I come back to the opening statement of this essay. “The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization”. The tough road is often a tedious path. And in India, this road is often avoided in favour of the easy. Jugaad. It is nothing but a shortcut. And we as a nation, nay, as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts. And hence we have fallen. Everything in India can be resolved by a shortcut. If you stand in a queue, there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee. Instead of paying your taxes, it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed. Why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? Why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? Why work hard when you can steal from someone? Why be polite when you do not have to be? Why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? I could go on and on. Everything in India has a shortcut. And this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society. Every single thing is now a shortcut. Jugaad. Why take the tougher road to civilization? Why apply our minds when someone else can do it? It is easier to run away to the West than stay back and make this country worth living in. Why perform original research in India where you have to build your own apparatus, when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the West, where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? Why? Why indeed? Because, it is the short cut. It is the easy path. And it shall lead us to barbarism. It is not an individual failing on the part of Indians. I will not blame any one person for this. It is a failing of our society. Indeed, it is a historical inevitability.

Historical inevitability? Yes, our decline was inevitable. Every great civilization has declined when its culture of openness is replaced by closed minds and an aversion to questions. Look at Islam a thousand year ago and today. If at all anyone dares to interpret the quoran any way other than the accepted dogma, he is immediately met with a fatwa calling for his beheading. Western civilization has flourished and prospered precisely because it has cast off the yoke that is the Catholic church and allowed free thought. This freedom of thought does remain in India, but only in vestiges. And as we have already seen, it is being gradually eroded. It is historical inevitability. The point is further clarified by a study of entropy. Entropy, in layman’s terms, is a measure of the disorderliness in a system. In any spontaneous process, Entropy always increases. So if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process, interspersed by periods where Man has consciously tried to improve himself, it is not difficult to see how every rise is followed by a fall. As I have already stated, taking the tougher road is an informed decision, while the easy path comes spontaneously. Every civilization at some point, will abandon the long tough road, to take the short cut. And when a society starts taking shortcuts, it begins to decline. Every civilization has declined and so shall we.

And so we have declined. Our fall has only begun. And we shall keep falling, for a long, long time. Is there nothing that can be done? I do not know. The only thing that can be done is the administration of a shock treatment. A shock treatment that so drastically affects us that we will be forced to change for the better. The Black Death in the 14th century jolted Europe and gave rise to the Renaissance, which laid the foundation for the current dominance of Western civilization. Kemal Mustafa Ataturk’s radical measures of Westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the Ottoman empire, gave rise to Modern Turkey. A nation that is a beacon of hope for the Muslim world. What kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of India’s decline? I do not know. But the least we can do, is acknowledge that we have a problem. And when you see the problem and the scale of it, it will give you the shock treatment.

**TL;DR - We are in decline because our culture has lost its ability to question and innovate. We also prefer shortcuts. It is a historical inevitability and there is nothing we can do about it.**
