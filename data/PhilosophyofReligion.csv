1331855605.0,25,self.PhilosophyofReligion,qykz2,Can non-theists avoid nihlism?,Dr_Platypusman,28,3,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/qykz2/can_nontheists_avoid_nihlism/,"If a theist ever asks a non-theist why they don't go around murdering people, I think they ought to respond this way:

""Because I am a product of my culture and natural selection. There were selection pressures applied to the development of Homo Sapiens that favoured group cohesion. I have inherited instincts towards empathy and cooperation. These instincts, like everything else, vary between individuals but they are the rule rather than the exception. Even if I did overcome these instincts, I have grown up in a culture that has imprinted these values into me. Because children are genetically programmed to develop this way, I have absorbed and accepted these values. That is the reason I don't murder people, even though I do not believe in hell.""

Now, I think this story is true, but there's still something a little uncomfortable about it. Isn't it admitting that it's just some arbitrary evolutionary history that led me to this particular flavour of 'moral'? It's not as if rape and murder are always bad for some cosmic reason, as the theist may argue. Had the selection pressures been different, you and I would have been given a very different set of moral instincts, and we would have been holding those just as high. 

So does this lead the non-theist straight into nihlism? I mean, we can all pretend for a moment that those values are objective and not just the product of some arbitrary environmental pressures. If fact I think pretending is exactly what we do. But I know that it's all just an illusion, and there's no objective 'right' and 'wrong'. The good news is that the illusion is hard-wired and very difficult to overcome (although I think the military has some training videos that work pretty well). 

I would be very interested in hearing some of the non-theistic moral foundations people might have. I'm familiar with Kant, Mill, Aristotle, and even modern moral theorists, but I don't like any one of them. Besides, I don't think most people who claim to have good moral foundations have ever heard of those things. I would be much happier to hear ordinary people and how they ground their moral foundations.

**Note:** I will not presume to speak for all my fellow Taoists, but I can at least speak from my own Taoist perspective.

Quite frankly, we think you are all insane.  Let me explain:

Taoism is a very old tradition, and so has many forms.  Generally there are two *directions* that one can lean with Taoism.  There is the so called ""popular"" form which is the kind you will find in the rural areas and temples of China.  Here spirits, daemons, and gods run rampant.  It is shamanistic and ancestral, basically your classic Chineses religion.  But there is also the ""philosophical"" side, which is heavily intelectual, and has very little in the way of supernatural ideas or 'faith' in any way.  This latter form is what most of /r/taoism fall into.

Most of Taoism is about understanding the Tao (or ""Dao"", both are acceptable spellings).  The Tao can be understood as the name we give to the underlying wisdom or way things work in the universe, in fact ""Tao"" can be translated as ""The Way"".  Everything works within the framework of the Tao.  But actions within it can be harmonious or unharmonious.  So to get what you want, its best to understand the Tao, because then you can better act harmoniously.

To a philosophical Taoist, this isn't metaphysical, rather it is obvious.  To walk down a mountain, it's best to walk the correct direction.  This is obvious, and harmonious.  Sometimes though, the ""unobvious"" is harmonious.  For instance, if a path in the opposite direction connects to a better path to get down the hill.  This concept is embodied in something we call ""Wu Wei"" or ""Wei Wu Wei"", ""Action without action.""  The point of which is that the obvious act is often strangely unharmonious.  And often it is timing and accuracy that define success, rather than bull-headed strength.

And then of course there is the Yin-Yang, which is the icon of Taoism.  Most see it as a symbol of good and evil, but this is one-dimensional.  Rather it is a symbol of opposites, and how we can often only know things in relation to their opposites.  You can only know light with dark, hot with cold, active with passive, etc.

Now all of this comes to a head at the very start of the root text of Taoism the ""Tao Te Ching"".  First two lines:

&gt; The tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao

&gt; The name that can be named is not the eternal Name

Which, other than being a big fat disclaimer that this is an esoteric religion, serves to point out that understanding the Tao cannot be done with words.  Words can set you on the path, but to understand the infinite workings of everything, you must find it with an internal dialog.  To go on about things is not only pointless, it's necessarily counter-productive.

Now I see a lot of people in religion that are really trying to find *themselves* in their search for ""God"" or a higher power.  This is evidenced by people ascribe their own values on to their higher powers.  Only after you find yourself can you find your gods.  Only after you ponder the true nature of the world around you can you find yourself.  And that might seem metaphysical, but I don't mean it as such, it's just simple logic.

I don't expect any one will truly understand my words.  You will deny things, or be thinking past my what I actually say.  Taoism talks about teaching without words, and how it is much more effective.  I could answer all of your questions one after another, and be completely correct, but it would get us no where.  There will be a disconnect.

But at least you can understand our perspective a bit better after this, and also how we think just about the worst thing you could do is go on about things.  It's just a bit crazy to us.

I have noticed some trends lately in comments on this subreddit. I realize this place is not the most active these days, so I figured this might spark some activity and trajectories while also clearing up some growing concerns in recent discussions. I propose we come up with a list of topics and some specific times to routinely get together and have some helpful round-table discussions on them. Ideas could come from things people are generally confused on, would like further information about, or individuals willing to share their knowledge on a particular topic (a modified AMA style). These discussions would not welcome vitriolic or parodic comments. The discussions would begin assuming that the figure or topic to be discussed is not nonsense or irrelevant but worth the time to wrestle through in order to be better equipped to dialogue about the philosophy concerning religion. The mods do not bear the sword for nothing, and in this case I would be making sure to weed out comments that do not contribute to constructive and cordial dialogue and debate.

The most obvious trend that appears to have cropped up is a growing number of contributors who are analytically-minded but unfamiliar with the vocabulary and major figures of continental philosophy, which is probably the dominant group of contributors in this subreddit. With that in mind, I think we could all benefit from some open discussions about things like the concept of God in particular schools of thought (death of God theology, postmodern theology, phenomenology, etc.), major figures in continental and analytic philosophy/theology (Hegel, Kierkegaard, Caputo, Plantinga, Wolterstorff, Marion, Derrida, etc.), and possibly certain narrations of recent historical movements in continental philosophy (I'm very partial to genealogies of thought, myself).

What are your thoughts? What would you be most interested in? Do you have a topic that you would like to share about or know more about?

**EDIT**: I know the downvoting speech is always unpopular, but please refrain from downvoting this post, as it would be helpful for more people in the subreddit to see it. If you do not wish to participate in this project, that's fine--say why, or leave the post be, but please do not downvote, as it does not give others the chance to see it for themselves.

According to him, your superego is the ""father figure"" which shapes your ego, and your ego is your personality (consisting of motivations, meditations, dreams, etc.). 

On the other hand, my Catholic high school always represented God as the father figure. God is the father, and Jesus is the ideal model for yourself. This might be confusing, but if Jesus is God in human form, then his Ego has grown to reflect that of his Superego (God), and modeling your ego after Jesus is the same as ""following the word of the Lord.""

I believe this relationship can be seen almost universally across different religions (or any group of people with a moral code). As a child, your parents take the place of your superego, modeling you after themselves. When you leave your parents and join another group of people, whether it is a church, fraternity, or even the army, you will have to replace your superego with that of the new group as a whole. From that point on, your ego will be shaped in a new direction.

Now, whether he used the big bang to create the universe and evolution to create man, I don’t know. But I have been thinking, we on earth don’t know everything. I think our knowledge about the sciences is infinitely small compared to what is really out there. I think there are matters not known to us, forces not known to us and even realities that we don’t know of. And I don’t think we will ever know everything. But I do think that God has worked through the ages using science to go about his purposes.

My other thought is whether God is governed by science. Did God create science for us, or did he use the forces of sciences to create us. This has been on my mind for a while. And although I like to think of myself as a pretty logical fellow, I need some more minds and thoughts on all of this.

They could be histories of metaphysics that introduce the history of metaphysical ideas in that way or an introduction to metaphysics that takes a less historical tact in making that connection. Or books where an author exposits their own particular metaphysical outlook that has a ""religious"" or profound significance.

By ""religious"" I mean some kind of world view that is ""divine"", ""sacred"" or if those words have too much mystification, involving some kind of ultimate benevolence or meaning grounded within the universe. I am particularly not meaning an organized religion such as Islam or Christianity. 

I mean metaphysics in a particular but broad sense of the term where an ultimate meaning to the universe is elaborated alongside an attempt to ground that meaning in a philosophical apprehension of what the universe is.

I am not Christian or an adherent of any organized religion. While I do have my own metaphysical outlook, it is much more similar to a ""New Age"" world view that is currently marginalized by the academic establishment, even within the philosophy of religion. That makes it very difficult to find metaphysical philosophy but I do grant that a metaphysical outlook which is religious must take some form- so I don't blame people for wanting to recommend me a Christian work of metaphysical philosophy. Yet it's not that I am necessarily looking for a metaphysical work that provides philosophical justification to a New Age outlook, its just that I am excluding organized religions because I find a Christian/Muslim/Buddhist outlook unsatisfying when I am looking for a philosophy/metaphysics that isn't grounded in a particular ""revelation"" but rather grounded in philosophical reason. (However, I think Schleiermacher claims to provide a purely philosophical justification for a variant of the Christian religion, and in as much as that is the case then it interests me)

By ""philosophical reason"" I do not mean only purely discursive reasoning but also reasoning that takes into account the subjective and aesthetic aspects of life.

I am interested in both continental and analytic ideas but I would find a metaphysical outlook more generally satisfying if it unified the aesthetic aspects of life with a metaphysical outlook- (or at least showed how the aesthetic is difficult or impossible to unify with a metaphysical outlook)

I also know that there is a post-modern outlook within the philosophy of religion that is anti-metaphysical. While I find that fascinating, I also find it hard to conceptualize a religious outlook without at least some kind implicit metaphysical worldview. But if something of that nature could be relevant to my quest for a philosophically grounded apprehension of (non-organized) ""religion"" then that would be of interest to me as well. 

Right now I have the ""God of Metaphysics"" which is by T.L.S Sprigge coming through inter-library loan, I also have tried to get Jean Grondin's Introduction to Metaphysics but was not able to because it was too new. If you can think of any books that I might be interested that would be great.

(I recognize that sometimes unorganized religious ideas can take place within the symbolism and framework of an organized religion. For example T.L.S Sprigge dedicated his last book to a Unitarian Church in Edinburgh- I am not opposed to or uninterested in organized religion in that sense but I'm more interested in the underlying idea than in an organized context of worship)

""Atheist"" defined as ""One who does not believe in God"" is still a valid definition. However, it is often used to describe very different things.

""Atheist"" has been used to describe many people who are ""effective"" atheists, because they do not act as if there is a God who cares about their actions. This includes agnostics, deists, et cetera. Furthermore, many of these worldviews came into popularity in the mid to late 18th century. Furthermore, agnostics and deists can be every bit as, if not more so, vehemently opposed to organized religion or ""religious thought"" as atheists; recall that agnostic Bill Maher made ""Religulous.""

Furthermore, I don't call Christians ""monotheists"" or Hindus ""polytheists"" in regular conversation, I call them Christians and Hindus. Monotheism and Polytheism describes part of their belief, not all. Those beliefs will most likely express themselves in how those people interact with other people individually as well as political and economic entities.

So there's these structurally very different worldviews that are sometimes all called atheism because they're functionally the same (and, as some argue, structurally the same). The word itself doesn't tell us anything about what the person thinks. However, many still assign heuristics to those words, both positive, ""All thinking men are atheists,"" and negative, ""Dogmatic atheists are just as bad as religious fundamentalists.""

When we want to exalt or admonish ""atheists"" as a group, why not use ""Secularist"" instead? Secularism is a more complete worldview, with a traceable history in the West that later exports to other lands. It's open to far less argument on definition, has a political voice, and would neatly describe Atheists, Agnostics, and Deists. It would be a more complete worldview descriptor than ""atheist,"" as it also defines a clear vision of what the world ought to be and what it is. What do you guys think?

*EDIT: I am not savvy enough to know whether all or most Buddhism is atheistic, but I know at least some of it is.

Basically, New argues, that every argument in favour of the 3-O God can be made just as well for the Devil. Not the Christian devil with a pitchfork but a being with exactly the same properties as God, except, it is omnimalevolent instead of omnibenevolent. He runs through the most popular arguments and makes his case, i think he was very convincing.

Following from this, he says, if we have two choices which have exactly equal evidential backing, it is irrational to choose one over the other and we should suspend judgment (hence not believe in God).

So I apologize if this sounds too rudimentary or almost stupid. Or if this is the wrong place to post it.

A proposed god knows everything, but there is so much chaos and wrong in the world. This presents a paradox (at least to me). Could the following be a solution to it?

Is is possible that what we call everything and what a higher being might call everything is very different? We say we ""know"" a piece of metal, but we can't truly ""know"" the individual particles that make it up. (See the uncertainty principle - you can't precisely know the position and momentum of a particle at the same time). So there are two different ""everything""s. The particle looks at us and says, he doesn't know me, he doesn't see me. He doesn't know everything. But we say, we know this piece of metal. We know its shape, temperature, hardness, color, etc. We don't care about the energy levels of individual particles as long as we know their average. (That gives us the temperature.) We know the whole. That's what matters at our level of existence. And we have control over the whole. 

A similar analogy can be made with points on a plane. We ""know"" the plane, but not the points individually.

Could a god's knowing everything and existence be similar? Things will happen at the ""particle level"" (the lower level of existence where we live) that he doesn't know and can't control. And they are possibly insignificant. He knows the whole, and can control the whole, since that's what matters at his level of existence.

So in that case the wrongs we see (along with everything else we do) would be insignificant, since at the higher level, they don't matter. The whole is good and right.

Has a similar idea been proposed by religious philosophers in the past?",,False,,t5_2sfeh,1359323526.0,,,True,t3_17d4ha,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/17d4ha/on_a_paradox_that_results_from_the_idea_of_a_god/,

So my question is: If there was no way to create a universe where man could truly love God without it being filled with evil, then why create it at all?

I'm interested in talking about the relationship between the various distinctly religious asceticism(s) - everything from vegetarianism to celibacy – and secular 'lifestyle choices'. 

One common trope I've observed among people who identify as anti-religious is mockery of the renunciations certain religious people make. 'It's stupid not to eat pork just because your god told you not to' would be a standard example. Looking at this, one thing that interests me is the degree to which things like the Kosher and Halal diets might be, in purely secular terms, rational (I don't know yet whether or not they are, which is why I'm starting this thread). 

Another starting point would be the (apparently but not necessarily common) opinion in the UK that immigrants and British Asian citizens ought to drink beer, with beer drinking seen as some central feature of British culture. Yet given how many people have alcohol problems, given the danger of large groups of drunken people, is it not quite a good idea for people to be teetotal? Does that change if the source of this is not consciously rational, but because it is a religious commandment? Of course at this point things get complicated.    

Anyway, I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts on this, preferably from many different directions. ",,False,,t5_2sfeh,True,,,True,t3_jgy3n,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/jgy3n/asceticism_and_reason/,

As the trained philosopher of religion will not fail to note, to address praise to even a presumed God is no mean feat. As Jean-Luc Marion highlights, the conflict between idol and icon is always “a conflict between two phenomenologies.” [1] As such, it is a conflict not between two competing objects with competing referents who otherwise are (have their Being) in the same way, but one between different ways in which these objects may be. That even objects which reference the ‘correct’ God may be idols, and the fluidity with which objects may traverse the divide between idol and icon both suggest this distinction. Rather, what is at stake is two distinct “modes of apprehension [or reception] of the divine in visibility.” [2]

For Marion, the basic form of the idol is not that of illusion or forgery. It is not properly illusory because it consists rather in the recognition of precisely that which cannot help but be seen; the idol stabilizes (grasps) that which captures the gaze, so that it can become a point of reference, given for the gaze’s use. It is not properly a forgery because the fabrication only enters the status of idol in the later, determinative, moment when it presents as “that which will fill a gaze.” [3] “The gaze makes the idol, not the idol the gaze—which means that the idol with its visibility fills the intention of the gaze, which wants nothing other than to see.” [4] The gaze stops upon some thing (the idol), and the idol re-presents that stopping point—the gaze’s own aim. Thus, the privileged metaphor for Marion is the invisible mirror; what the idol presents to the gaze is the gaze in its own intention, but it shows this in a way that masks over—renders invisable—its own operation. [5]

The icon, on the other hand, phenomenally inverts the operation of the idol. The icon is not determined by the gaze, but “provokes” it towards a vision unaccountable within its own aim. [6] In the icon, Paul’s formula rendering Jesus the “icon of the invisible God” becomes paradigmatic; the icon does not present the visible as a means of discerning between visible and invisible, offering an image for the grasp of the gaze. [7] Instead, the icon presents the invisible precisely as invisible; as that which confronts the gaze without becoming an object for the gaze’s determination. The privileged reference here is a face; because the gaze and aim that determine the icon as icon are not those that belong to the one who apprehends the icon, but to the icon itself as presentation of the invisible, the one who apprehends finds in the icon not a thing but an aim alien to herself, by which she is confronted. Thus, while the idol’s reflexive origin admits a fixed point of return, the icon can be submitted to no measure, no aesthetic, but only to its own apocalyptic, abyssal “infinite excessivess.” [8]

What is important here for the philosopher of religion is the idol/icon analytic when applied to the conceptual names of God. How is one to address our praise to true God rather than idol?

If one were to tolerate intolerance, then one perpetuates intolerance; meaning, to tolerate intolerance is to be intolerant by mere extension. It is not desirable to be perfectly tolerant of everything. In a tolerant society one must be intolerant of intolerance in order to continually define the boundaries of tolerance.""

**EDIT (PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING):**The list of thinkers has grown pretty large, which is great. What would be most helpful now is to start categorizing them a little more specifically. Any ideas for a key like the one I suggested above? Also, perhaps a chronological order within categories would be helpful? If so, if someone would be interested in compiling them as such that would be great, otherwise it will take me a while to get through them all. Thanks, everyone!

**EDIT #2: I'm thinking we should shift our focus, now, to some categorization. After that, we can then continue to submit thinkers under a more specialized rubric. I'm going to be largely gone from Reddit for Easter weekend, so I'll be sure to look into categorization suggestions on Monday and decide what to do then. So: no more new submissions as far as thinkers go until after we've hashed out a helpful categorization method.

For a Buddhist, salvation must be earned through self discipline. Christianity on the other hand preaches that everyone can obtain salvation so long as they repent their sins at the end of the line. God will forgive all (I'm getting this from Luke 15:11, the story of the father who forgave his wayward son because he thought he had lost him, but he had returned. If I've misinterpreted this please correct me!).
Personally, I think the Buddhists have the right idea. We'll get more done as a society if we feel salvation must be earned through discipline and self control (and i feel i should make it clear that i'm talking about applying only this one aspect, and not buddhism as a whole, to our society) than if we go about sinning left and right thinking it will all work out if we repent before we die. But as a human being i must admit that the christian road to salvation seems like an easy way out and is very tempting...

What is the Ego?  My knee jerk reaction is to say that the Ego is needed because it helps us be more motivated.  But then I sit and question where this thought comes from.   

A movie called 'Revolver' and a few Youtube videos showing clips and talking of Ego; really made me think.  I have also been doing some meditation and other internal reflections; which has also led me to the idea that there is a higher self which is observing all that you think and all that you do.   

Here is where I am going with this, it ties religion to this idea of Ego and the Higher Self.

Scriptures talk of God being within and the Kingdom of heaven is in everyone.  That God made us in his image, ect. ect.   So my thinking right now is that the Ego is Satan and that the Higher self is Godlike; and by acting on either internal dialog we either are walking the path of Good or Bad.  

This concept is leading me to believe that to follow the path of your higher self, which almost always is one that benefits the planet and others around you.  We are doing the work of God, or whatever you care to call it.  Then the opposite holds true for following and acting on your Ego's impulses for these actions only benefit yourself and typically at the cost of the planet and the other human beings.

http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Algorithmic_probability

http://www.vetta.org/documents/disSol.pdf

Solomonoff induction is a formalization of Occam's razor and the fundamentals of probability theory. It itself is not computable but all existing intelligent entities perform some approximation of it. The closer the approximation, the more optimal the intelligence.

Basically, the probability of some future event occurring is the sum of the inverse of 2 ^ [kolmogorov complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity) of all algorithms that known predict past events and predict that future event. The constant ""2"" is actually relative to the turing complete language used to explain the theory and all calculated probabilities will need to be increased to account for non-halting algorithms and algorithms excluded by known past events although these operations too are of course not computable and must be approximated.

This means that theories involving irreducibly complex terms will make implausible predictions, unless there are more simple theories that make those same predictions, or there are few simpler theories that predict those past events.

Thus religions involving intelligent gods are not likely to be true unless the complexity of that god's behavior is reducible.

One thing to be careful about is that this all only makes sense if your theories make predictions. Reducing a god's behavior to terms like ""anger"" is meaningless, unless the term anger itself is complex.",,False,,t5_2sfeh,True,,,True,t3_i4yur,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/i4yur/solomonoff_induction_completely_explains_the/,

I have been plagued my entire life by homicidal and sadistic urges. I smashed frogs when I was a little kid. I put a fish on an anthill once. I have, however, always refrained from fulfilling my life's desire to kill someone.

This is my issue. Why would ""God"" create such a person? Why would he bring me to life? Is it to test me for 80 years to see if I'll break down one day? If he is all-knowing, then he already knows if I do that one day, and he already knows if I don't. So what's the point? Why bring a person into life, give them this terrible disposition, then watch them struggle for year after year, decade after decade.

I should point out that I was raised Roman Catholic, and while I consider myself an atheist now (because of this very dilemma) the only reason I refrain from wholesale serial killing is that I very much enjoy being a free person, and what little conscience I have would not want to break my mother's heart. I do fear what will happen when she is dead though, and there are no more links between myself and humanity....

So tell me, atheists, Christians, whatever. Why would god do this to me? And I don't want to hear that horseshit about ""nobody can know god's plan"" I want to hear your thoughts, hypotheses, guesses, whatever as to why god would bring a person like me into this world just to watch them struggle with their own nature.

I've been reading up on the Ontological argument via Graham Oppy's ""Ontological Arguments and Belief in God"". I've also been reading the book ""Realism and Religion"" edited by Andrew Moore and Michael Scott which had an essay that briefly talked about how God is supposed to be mysterious. I got to thinking, and I came up with two arguments that I want opinions on. (Note that I am in no way claiming they are valid or sound, and I have no idea if they are actually formulations of other arguments, i.e. I'm not claiming truth and originality.)

The first is the weak argument:

* 1. If God exists, then he is a being that is greater than any being that can be conceived.
* 2. If God exists, then he is mysterious in the sense that he cannot be understood in his entirety.
* 3. Any being which cannot be understood in their entirety cannot be known to be the greatest being that can be conceived.
* 4. Therefore, we cannot know if God exists.

The second is the strong argument:

* 1. If God exists, then he is a being that is greater than any being that can be conceived.
* 2. If God exists, then he is mysterious in the sense that he cannot be understood in his entirety.
* 3'. Any being which cannot be understood in their entirety is not the greatest being that can be conceived.
* 4'. Therefore, God does not exist.

I'm looking for holes in the argument, so give me your best rebuttals and critiques.

I can't see a theist rejecting 1, though I could see a theist trying to reject 2. To justify 2, I ask why God does certain things, why he chooses certain things (e.g. why he chose to answer prayer x in one way and not another, or why he chose to answer prayer x instead of prayer y), or the fact that we don't completely know God's nature.

I think most critiques will be aimed at 3 and 3', but I want to see what those critiques are (if you level them).

The only critique I got was that 3 has no merit because ""greatness"" is subjective, even though I defined ""is greater than"" as ""objectively better or more worthy than."" That, and the only other responses were that ""all ontological arguments are problematic, they are based on silly word games"" and ""...theists don't generally rely on reason anyway, for their existence claims, they rely on faith"" which don't help me at all. Subjectivity is the only thing that I could see wrong with the argument.

It's simple physics, but simply put all the atoms in you where once in stars (over simplified and not completely accurate I´m sure). 

However it is not the physical aspect of this qoute i wish to discuss but rather a philosophical thought of mine regarding this very qoute.

You see man has for a long time been dependant on the existence or virtual existence of a ""god/s"". Correct me if I am wrong but have not all tribes had a god of some sort? Well my philosophical observation is that the there are real gods out there, you see them every day only you call them stars. They are everything that gods claim to be, creators of life, destroyers of worlds but of course the reverse is also true they claim life and create worlds.

Now what if we were to continue as if this was true, we view these objects as gods. We would realize that we are part of them as we have their materials inside of us, so in a way we would all be former gods. this leads to an intriguing hypothesis, maybe we are angels fallen from grace (sillmarillion anyone?).

Maybe this is the reason that we always look up at the sky in awe, thats wy we always want to explore further and further, because the parts of us that are gods or rather once were gods yearn to reclaim their honor. Our body, is divine while our minds are mortal? Maybe our bodys affects our minds because it wants to become divine once more, and this is the source of the human curiosity which drives us?

&gt;Which brings me onto Lalita – “she who plays”. How do I relate to Lalita? Well, I don’t see Lalita as a particularised being – a person, if you like. I’ve been thinking a lot recently about how books on paganism/magic tend to place limitations of deities. I’m thinking of the kind of approach you get in a lot of books, where you get a short “biographical” sketch of a god or goddess – what they “look like”, what their likes/dislikes are, a myth or two, and what their “function” is (i.e. you call on god x for healing, god y for courage, etc). It seems very reductive, to me. Like for magic to happen, everything has to get neatly filed away in little boxes.

&gt;For me, Lalita is everything, and everything is Lalita, so it’s about how I relate to everything – a much bigger proposition. And that, i think, comes down to making a commitment to live in a particular way, to recognise Lalita’s potential presence in every moment, every encounter. There’s this idea, in some tantric texts, that we are most close to the divine when we experience moments (no matter how fleeting) of astonishment, wonder, joy or delight, so my basic orientation to the world is to be open to being surprised, to being playful, because the world? is Lalita’s play. of course there are days when I forget this, and yet there are days when it seems I can barely contain the joy and wonder I feel for the diverse, playful, wonder of the world, and find my marvelling at the flight of birds, or retractable ballpoint pens. This comes out of the last decade or so, when my guru began to take me through some of the core practices associated with his approach to SriVidya, which is an approach to tantra oriented around Lalita. Doing that practice led to me questioning a lot of the stuff I’d done previously, and coming to think of tantra as being basically about attempting to live my life in a particular way, rather than simply doing a particular set of practices.",,False,,t5_2sfeh,False,,,True,t3_j8yqx,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/j8yqx/phil_hine_on_well_tantric_panentheism_basically/,

**New Year Greetings: Secularism is also faith-based**

.....


**We should be happy for secularization**

When we go into 2013, I have one hope when it comes to this trend: it is that the people in power, both in politics and in the media, must learn to distinguish between 'secularity' and 'secularism'.
Secularity we should be thankful for. In Charles Taylor's understanding, secularity means, as social norm, that the possibility of both religious belief and denial of God is open. Within and between these there is the possibility, of course, a wealth of alternative approaches. The point is that a society characterized by secularism principle opens public space for the diversity of positions in relation to the religious.
Secularism, on the other hand, is an approach that basically has rejected religion's role and purpose in the public domain. It often appears as an arrogant confidence in science, its results and limitless possibilities in an enlightened and a-religious future. For secularists, the distinction between church and state is only the first step to displace religion to the private sphere, and then get rid of it completely. The paradox of this position is that it is faith based. This means that it requires the clearance, as the secularity creates. Secularism suppresses this dimension in its essence. It claims to operate with objective and scientific truth.
For all of us who are genuinely interested in matters of religion, it should be our hope, that that decade, we now live in, may be known as the 'secularity’s time'. While secularism is exclusive and judgmental, secularity gives room for diversity and creativity.""


Isn't he completely off? I think he strays far from common understandings of the terms and gives a wrong and harsh picture of well... the non-religious, as if they are just as faith based as religious and are blind in science. Maybe he should be more clear and deep in his explanations, I dunno.

Belief in belief is more important than most other kinds of belief.

You know that the world exists, and that's as much as you can ever know. The world exists, to you.

The world is made up of different things. Things have attributes. A thing can have a name, a shape, particular materials/colors, sub-things, a location (or distribution of likely locations), etc.

You can see, hear, touch, etc. the world, and you have learned to identify patterns in it over the course of your life.

Some of the patterns you have learned to identify make up a language. A language is a customary association of phrases with meanings. Some phrases are legal and others are illegal in your language. Some sequences of sound are words, and others aren't. Some ways of combining words are allowed by the grammar of your language, and others aren't. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words combined by grammar.

Human language is unique among animal communication because it is recursive. Recursive means that valid phrases can contain valid phrases. ""The squirrel on the branch of the tree with the yellow leaves is eating.""

Logic is a method of transferring falsehood from some statements to others. Based on which statements are true, logic can tell you other statements that are definitely true. Logic starts with base principles, called axioms. Axioms are rules for the grammar of logic.  An invalid statement is one that cannot be generated by any way of combining axioms in a certain order (repeating axioms is allowed).

Human languages have syntax and semantics. Semantics is meaning, and syntax is structure. ""The cat hid under the bed"" and ""Seven dwarves lived in the forest"" have very similar syntax, but very different semantics. The words combine in the same way. Phrases with complicated meanings come from meaningfully combining phrases with simpler meanings.

Logic is mostly about syntax. The only meaning that it contains is ""false"". Sometimes, it has ""false that false"", ""false that (false that false) that false"", etc. As you can see, we can compose ""false"" with itself and with combinations by using ""that"". The syntax of logic combines the idea ""false"" in the same way that the syntax of language combines words. Every inclusion is also an exclusion. Identifying when something has a certain attribute is the same ability as identifying when it doesn't have a closely related other attribute. ""False"" is a property of some logically defined statements, and some statements are statements about statements (logical statements can contain other logical statements).

It is untrue that it is snowing here now. If it were snowing, I would see and feel snow, but I don't. Snow is frozen water, and the air here feels room temp, and it would feel different if it were cold enough for snow. Closed rooms block snow, and I'm inside a closed room. It is definitely not snowing here now.

Descartes said ""I think, therefore I am""; ""My thought definitely exists"". Because your senses are limited, and you have to use reason to decide what's true and what's false in your identification of things in the world, nearly all of the identifications you've made over the course of your life might be false to a large or small degree. But there is exactly one thing that withstands questioning completely: ""Am I questioning?"". You can't reliably doubt whether you're doubting without being sure that you're doubting. Doubting/questioning/asking/wondering/thinking are all the same process; the answer takes the form of classification, which you sometimes do inaccurately by mistake; classification is identifying attributes of things.

Each human has a brain. Humans also have kidneys and hair. Birds and earthworms also have brains. But only the brains of humans (unique among creation, made in God's image) give rise to what we identify as minds. You can identify humans based on your sensory input, and you can identify that most humans are people based on how they act. A person is a mind, and a human has a brain. A human brain complicatedly gives rise to a mind (neurons encode categories, and they fire in patterns, which induce other patterns, is our current understanding). It's straightforward how a mind gives rise to a brain: it thinks that brains exist. The person associated with a mind knows/believes/suspects that s/he as well as other humans and animals have brains.

If a statement contradicts another statement, then one of them is wrong. If you encounter two statements that contradict each other, both of which you believe to be true, then there is a flaw somewhere in your system of belief. Based on the leap of faith (thankfully a safe one) that a unifying explanation exists that accounts for everything you think is true, you can search for and usually find (i.e., think of) a way of expanding or adjusting your system of explanations that results in no contradictions.

Logical truth/falsehood is objective. Everyone who accepts the premises (axioms) of a logical system gets the same answers if they calculate correctly. Procedures have been developed that have correct sequences of steps. If you know logic, and you perceive someone saying something that you know is logically wrong, then you know that either you or they either followed an illogical chain of deduction or started with incompatible facts.

There is a different world in the head of each person. The world as you believe it exists is based on how you have learned to explain your sensory input over the course of your life. You're the only person who has ever had your particular trail of sensory input, and has come up with your particular system of explanations for it. You can think about what other people are thinking, but you're still using your system to model their systems. You can understand a thought that someone says, but you're using your grammatical rules to combine the words that you think the speaker intended. All you ever have access to is your own system of knowledge.

It's really important that you can make statements about statements. Then you can know how wrong a statement is; you can also know how sure your estimation is of how wrong a statement is. People who have gotten very good at identifying statements that are very probably not wrong work in the fields of science and math.

A logical system contains no contradictions; with the right axioms, it is completely consistent. It fails to be inconsistent. Claiming that it is inconsistent would, itself, be inconsistent.

It seems that the minimal number of axioms is one. That means that the minimal axiom is that there is exactly one axiom. The one axiom is the number 1. Combining it with itself and combinations of itself yields all of logic.

God is responsible for the fact that the universe exists. The universe, i.e. our perception of it, contains order and structure. The one thing we know about God is that we cannot know anything else about God. God is by definition unproveable; God's existence must be accepted as a postulate. God is perfect and whole, total consistency. Total consistency cannot be derived from inconsistency of inconsistency. God is beyond our system of knowledge. God is Truth.

Consider phenomenon x (phenomenon being an event or state of affair in need of casual explanation).

Here is the dilemma: 

Either x can be currently explained in terms of natural processes or it can not be.

If x can be explained in terms of natural processes, then supernatural explanations are superfluous (if we accept the validity of The Law of Parsimony that is).

If x can not be currently explained in terms of natural processes, this is not proof that it can't be in the future. It means simply that we are currently ignorant of the causes of x. Claiming x is supernatural because it has no known natural cause(s) would seem to be making the so called ""Argument from Ignorance"" (from Informal Logic).

If this is true, then how can any phenomenon be proved to be supernatural?

Maybe I'd be paraplegic....* This line of thinking brought me to the question:
&gt;What is the smallest possibly thing I can possibly call my ""self""? If I cut my arm off, I am still me. If I lose my body, I am still me. When do I cease being me?

As a materialist, the answer is pretty straightforward: I am my brain. If you cut my brain up, I will die. Surely, there are some questions about how much I can cut up my brain, but at least I know that my brain is the seat of ""my self.""

However, what is the Christian concept of the self? I have Googled once, and texted a friend. I got two ideas.

* The first idea was from my friend: your self is your spirit-soul. It is your personality.

*  The pastor on Google said that your soul was a part of the constellation of the mind, heart, and spirit. Your soul was the big important thing in regards to the self. We said some things along the lines of, ""Your soul is your personality; it is your memory banks."" 

Now, as a materialists, I disagree, but surely Christians, especially Catholic and Orthodox and the liturgical churches, have a more complex view of the ""self"" that are not easily dismiss-able as these two ideas.

I have noticed a recent increase in downvotes that seem to be quite arbitrary. I figured perhaps it would be helpful to remind everyone of the purpose of downvoting.

Downvoting is used to weed out links that are not explicitly related to the themes and issues of philosophy of religion. Thankfully, we actually don't get very many of those around here. That being the case, there are plenty of links and discussions that seem to have a few downvotes which is disconcerting. You are free, of course, to disagree with the opinions or subjects expressed in a particular link or discussion, but downvoting them will only make them less visible to readers who may legitimately want to interact with them. Checking the ""new"" page revealed several links that had not made it to the front page because of arbitrary downvoting.

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but if it isn't, please remove it. I just want a clear distinction on the term of judgment.*

I was at church a few days ago when the service was about to end. I noticed that a speaker told everyone to greet one another and for everyone to say hello to new people I was a new person, but I wasn't approached by anybody - in fact, I had to go up to people for them to talk to me. But that's not the point I'm making here.

I told my friend about it and he remarks that I'm being judgmental and that only God can judge others. The problem here that I'm seeing is that he is referring to judgment defined as in, ""That guy is a bad man."" or ""That girl is a real jerk."" These seem to mean negative (and I guess positive?) opinions on people.

What I continued to say to him was that because the congregation did not really approach me, or rather any new people, it was something that should be worked on. He then told me that not everyone is as outgoing as I am and to stop being so judgmental.

I could not put it into words, but the concept I was using was judging, or observing something as functional or not. In this case, the people had failed to greet the new people and instead more or less bound to their cliques. I said this was a problem that needed to be fixed. I told him that I'm more of a guy that, if I saw a guy running outside with his shoe laces loose, I'd point it out that he might want to fix it because he could trip. In that sense, I don't think that is being judgmental in the same way people judge others as good or bad.

This is important to me because we hear that phrase all the time: ""Only God can judge me"", but it's only used as a defensive response. I think Christians need to understand that there is a judging of this sort: ""Man, that guy Bob is a turdball, avoid him."" and a judging of this sort: ""If a city has a police department that fails to do its job, then that's a problem."" One is simply an opinion and the other is an observational assessment.

The other issue that I have with the topic of judgment is that I feel that people can use it as a defensive statement to ultimately neglect their responsibilities. Maybe someone might say, ""Hey Joe, you haven't paid the bill in 2 weeks, you are being lazy."" Then Joe (who does go to church) might say ""Only God can judge me."", when he spent his latest paychecks buying a PS3 or whatever and playing that 10 hours everyday. If a person is being clearly lazy, then saying they are so would be pointing it out as an observation, not a statement with ill-intent. But Joe in this case feels slightly hurt by this statement and thinks of it as an attack. So if this sort of ""judging"" were not allowed, then it seems Joe can do what he pleases and use his same phrase.

Well thanks for reading this and comments are appreciated. I'll talk about this more with my friend next Sunday.",,False,,t5_2sfeh,False,,,True,t3_obhh7,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/obhh7/only_god_can_judge_me/,

The snake convinces Eve to take the fruit and eat it, so she could know all, like God. As the story goes, she is convinced and is kicked out (along with Adam, who also ate the fruit) for this sin. They apparently betrayed God and doomed humanity to sin and misery and whatever. However, I believe that this is untrue. I believe God set that rule to test Adam and Eve's free will. The thing about humans is that we have the freedom to think about whatever we want. When God created humans, he intentionally created us with free will. If he truly did not want Eve to eat from that tree, why create her with free will? He certainly had the power to. 

Okay, so if God wanted Eve to eat the fruit, why did he curse us with mortality and child birth? Being blissfully ignorant humans would mean that we could live a lifetime in paradise and not mind it a bit. Being free willed and independent thinkers means that paradise will be paradise, but only for a short while. Boredom and restlessness soon arises when you have everything you could ever want for all of eternity. The way to solve this? Mortality. There's no point in reproducing if you are immortal. With no need to worry about death, there's no need for reproducing, as you'll forever be alive and surviving. Why does God let such bad things happen to us? Because of free will. Free will means that God does not have control over us. He is not our omnipotent puppetmaster. He is our omnipotent creator, who lets his creations create a life of their own. Interfering and moderating that would contradict free will. And with free will comes misery, sadness, loss, regret, and pain. But with free will comes peace, happiness, acceptance, and other positive things. 

I believe that God had already planned for Eve (or Adam) to eat the fruit, and he had set up the world to complement the free will that all humans have. Murder, rape, and other crimes exist because humans have created them. God did not first kill. Man did. He knew that we would feel pain, but because he loves us, he knew that it was necessary in order to bring true happiness. I'm sure that it pains him to see the world in such a miserable state, but he knows that we'll pull through by ourselves. He loves us, and therefore, gives us free will and independence.

tl;dr: God intentionally created us with free will, knowing that Eve (or Adam) would eat the fruit. Everything they experienced after was designed for us for having free will.

I apologize if this is in the wrong Reddit, I'm still disgustingly new here. For those of you who don't believe in God, or don't believe in Genesis, then think of this as a clever literary analysis. I'm sure that there are some parts I'm wrong about, or that possibly this has already been debunked. Feel free to point these out or give other opinions. In fact, I encourage it.",,False,,t5_2sfeh,False,,,True,t3_vtwza,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/vtwza/why_eve_passed_the_test_when_taking_the_forbidden/,

I got a degree in general literature and did some history/philosophy etc as a part of that - so I am familiar with scientific texts. And even though religion was not  part of my upbringing I already know some things about christianity (and since I am from the west it is a big part of my heritage anyway). 

In the end my interests go towards archeology of religion and ritual/ anthropology of religion on the one hand - and on the other hand toward iconography and the study of religious images. Non-western theology is definitely interesting, but I would like to focus more on the basics of of the western religions since that is my heritage: christianity, judaism, some islam, roman/greek, other heathen religions. Maybe I am going to focus on cults and sects from the last centuries of the roman empire - or how heathen elements survived up until today and were mixed with christianity. 

I know these are all BIG subjects, but that is why I want to find some primers, so I can gather enough knowledge to make an educated decision on what to read next :-)

Anyway: I would be really grateful if anyone could give me a few pointers. (I can read English, German and Dutch)

The God that knows all truth, therefore, must have a vested interest in the relief of suffering, because he experiences the joys and sorrows of all people.  If Truth takes an interest in the well-being of all, then Truth is Love (God is Love?)

Is joy and suffering necessarily a zero-sum game?  In other words, is suffering necessary for joy?  Leaving aside the deeper question of whether one thing is required to make its opposite meaningful, it is certainly possible to act like joy and suffering is a zero-sum game by screwing other people over for one's own gain.  But is it necessarily this way?  Further, is suffering necessary for conscious beings to sustainably live on their planet?  

If it is not a zero-sum game, then Truth must be interested in the development of a civilization that maximizes joy and minimizes suffering and lives sustainably (something like a New Jerusalem?)

It also means God loves you.

Recently I did some reading on the Soul as described in the Bible. It's a surprisingly complex subject. One thing that I found really interested was that the ""soul"" is not presented quite like many people think of it nowadays. 

The word ""nephesh"" doesn't refer to a disembodied ghost which controls a meat vehicle. The wiki article defines the word like this "" According to this verse God did not make a body and put a soul into it like a letter into an envelope of dust; rather he formed man's body from the dust, then, by breathing divine breath into it, he made the body of dust live, i.e. the dust did not embody a soul, but it became a soul—a whole creature""

The idea is is that the soul is not merely some disembodied mind that controls the body but is the entire being itself. 

Going off of this, I recently learned about a theological tradition called [Christian Mortalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mortalism)

The idea of a disembodied self really comes from Plato's influence rather than early Church theology. Thinking on these various theological ideas I thought of something. 

I'm not sure this is a new way of approaching the mind-body problem but let me know or give me some feedback on what you think. I think the Christian Mortalist view on the soul would solve the Mind-Body problem but additionally I think it might fit with current neuroscience. 

I'm relating this to the idea of Emergence. The idea is that the sum can be greater than its parts alone. Consciousness, some neuro guys argue isn't a particular part of the brain, nor is it a extra-bodily soul. Instead it is something which emerges from the complex processes of the whole mind. Our ""selves"" are not just the neurons, but are actually the immaterial quality which comes from their complex interaction. 

This theory of the mind is usually tossed up by hardline logical positivist who want to take the wind out of theistic sails. But it seems to me, that perhaps, and I'm not sure, that it is probably the most accurate description of the soul as the Bible describes it in Genesis.

Consequently, our whole moral struggle, even as our rational inquiry - if we once admit that God is the last end of our endeavors - will bring us sooner or later (rather later, much later, than sooner) to emancipation not only from moral evaluations but also from reason's eternal truths. Truth and the Good are fruits of the forbidden tree; for limited creatures, for outcasts from paradise. I know that this ideal of freedom in relation to truth and the good cannot be realized on earth - in all probability does not need to be realized. But it is granted to man to have prescience of ultimate freedom. Before the face of eternal God, all our foundations break together, and all ground crumbles under us, even as objects - this we know - lose their weight in endless space, and - this we shall probably learn one day - will lose their impermeability in endless time.

Now I think an inductive argument, arguing from what is epistemicly likely, could also be made against God's allowance of natural evil. Please tell me if others have come up with this before me, give objections, or advice on how to better formulate it.



Deductive form (weakest):


(1) An event E is an atrocity if and only if one is morally obligated to prevent E from obtaining


(2) Rape is an atrocity


(3) Therefore, God is morally obligated to prevent rape



Inductive form (stronger):


(1) An event E is an atrocity if and only if one is morally obligated to prevent E from obtaining


(2) It is very surprising that, given rape happens, that the rape would not be an atrocity


(3) There is no reason to think that rape is not an atrocity


(4) Therefore, by inference to the best explanation, God is morally obligated to prevent rape


Premise (1) is a definition, it cannot be denied. Premise (2) is I think incredibly intuitive, everyone can easily accept it. For instance lets suppose what the implications of denying (2) would be; it would mean that it was perfectly morally permissible to turn a blind eye to rape, to let it just happen. In fact I would draw the denial of (2) further and say that if it's false then no one has any right to infringe on the freedom of another, and stop them from raping. It would actually be morally wrong to get involved and save the victim.



This is of course complete absurdity. Lets consider it a little further, our police and justice system is built entirely around the intuition we all have that there are some acts people do which are so evil that they are not worth the freedom they are preformed in. If we were to deny (2) how could we support the public justice system, a system which exists mostly to take away the freedom of those committing what we believe to be atrocities.



Of course there are many other occurrences which we consider atrocities, but rape is possibly one of the most obvious; allowing one enough freedom to rape another is nothing short of a complete failure of moral responsibility.



I understand in deductive form the argument fails due to a defense of some kind (though not the free will defense), but in inductive form a defense would be useless. I have seen a verity of theodicies, but ultimately I think they all fail and the best explanation remains the maltheistic hypothesis.

Spiritual and Material Values

""Every experience has its level of physiology, and so unbounded awareness has its own level of physiology which can be measured. Every aspect of life is integrated and connected with every other phase. When we talk of scientific measurements, it does not take away from the spiritual experience. We are not responsible for those times when spiritual experience was thought of as metaphysical. Everything is physical. Consciousness is the product of the functioning of the brain. Talking of scientific measurements is no damage to that wholeness of life which is present everywhere and which begins to be lived when the physiology is taking on a particular form.

Many Argue over what is the true god, but who's to say that they don't all exist? Perhaps Allah and Jehovah and Zeus and any other god ever written or talked about exists but only rules over their own people. So Allah is the god of Muslims while Jesus and the Trinity rule over Christians, but both of these gods coexist.
Another thought. How can someone of devout faith be totally sure that these other gods are not the true god masquerading to test their faith. Or that these holy wars are the same? Simply a test to see if true believers will take the bait and fight their fellow man.

1328898359.0,3,self.PhilosophyofReligion,pjnqd,Consciousness: Can anyone expand on this?,,6,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/pjnqd/consciousness_can_anyone_expand_on_this/,"I've come to the conclusion that conscious self-awareness proves eternal existence in a way. The fact that we know that we are existing in the present leads me to believe that we will continue to be conscious in some fashion for all eternity. If there were ever a point in which we ceased to exist, wouldn't it follow that we wouldn't be aware of our own existence right now? Kind of like a man with severe amnesia, not having any idea that he was ever conscious before that moment when he awoke, so too would we not know that we are existing at the present moment after our minds die. I think it makes sense that even if I live for as long as the universe is habitable (which is a very, very long time) and then cease to exist, I wouldn't realize that I am existing now, as there is an infinitude of non-existence ahead of ""me"".

I think it would make sense because theoretically an infinite can exist only if the time that it came into existence was not infinite in the past. Like you can't have an infinite number of past experiences because you would have to go through all of them to get to where you are now which is logically impossible (since infinity can never be reached or crossed), but you can potentially go on forever. What I'm conveying is more of an observational approach to consciousness, in that, if you were ever to go back into a nonexistent state, then you would not now know that you are now conscious. It's hard to put into words.

It's clear that the call is open to multiple responses, since the call is a saturated phenomenon and exceeds finite expressions of it. And the call is made manifest in the response. However, does this mean that the response defines the call? This would seem to me to elminate the givenness of the call and lapse into psychologism, where the conclusion is that everyone is able to simply define the call as they imagine it to be rather than as it gives itself.

So does the response simply acknowledge the ""undeniable facticity"" of the call, or does it go further and even define the call? How do responses relate to the giving of the call and our thinking of the call?

Your thoughts?,,2,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/rdb5w/religion_and_science_articles_that_have_helped/,"Just discovered this Reddit, and this seems like the kind of thing that fits here, so here goes...

First, [Stanley Fish](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/god-talk-part-2/#more-2921). Fish's argument can basically be summed up in this paragraph:

&gt;Evidence, understood as something that can be pointed to, is never an independent feature of the world. Rather, evidence comes into view (or doesn’t) in the light of assumptions – there are authors or there aren’t — that produce the field of inquiry in the context of which (and only in the context of which) something can appear as evidence.

and this one:

&gt;To bring all this abstraction back to the arguments made by my readers, there is no such thing as “common observation” or simply reporting the facts. To be sure, there is observation and observation can indeed serve to support or challenge hypotheses. But the act of observing can itself only take place within hypotheses (about the way the world is) that cannot be observation’s objects because it is within them that observation and reasoning occur.

and finally this one:

&gt;Pking gets it right. “To torpedo faith is to destroy the roots of . . . any system of knowledge . . . I challenge anyone to construct an argument proving reason’s legitimacy without presupposing it . . . Faith is the base, completely unavoidable. Get used to it. It’s the human condition.” 

Then there is [*Religion and Theology: A Sermon for our Times* by John Tulloch](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26035/26035-h/26035-h.htm), written in the late 19th century. Tulloch's argument essentially boils down to this: The conflict is not between religion and science but between theology and science. Theology is the *interpretation* of the scriptures, and throughout history it has adapted to the circumstances. In the below section, Tulloch is discussing a St. Paul's quote, ""I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."" Tulloch equates this ""subtilty"" with theology.

&gt;What the special corruptions from Christian simplicity were with which the minds of St Paul's Corinthian converts were assailed, it is not necessary for us now to inquire. Their special dangers are not likely to be ours. What concerns us is the fact, that both St Paul and Christ—his Master and ours—thought of religion as something simple. Attachment to Christ was a simple personal reality, illustrated by the tie which binds the bride, as a chaste virgin, to the bridegroom. It was not an ingenuity, nor a subtilty, nor a ceremony. It involved no speculation or argument. Its essence was personal and emotional, and not intellectual. The true analogy of religion, in short, is that of simple affection and trust. Subtilty may, in itself, be good or evil. It may be applied for a religious no less than for an irreligious purpose, as implied in the text. But it is something entirely different from the ""simplicity that is in Christ.""

He argues towards the end that it is the job of theologians to adapt to this new age, as they have throughout the centuries. I always felt this was really prescient, as people *need* god, and they also *want* guidance about how to be closer to god, but maybe that guidance these days has let them down, has led them away from Christ (or whatever god they worship) and real religiosity.

1331647941.0,1,self.PhilosophyofReligion,qujdf,"Defining ""causality"", a job for theology",Logical1ty,4,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/qujdf/defining_causality_a_job_for_theology/,"I think the issue which encapsulates the entire idea of ""philosophy of religion"" is the philosophy of causality.

The ""default"" understanding of causality these days is *natural causality*, where we define causality based upon our observations of the external world (thus ""natural"").

A major paradigm shift occurred in Western thought with David Hume's redefining of causality to essentially describe it as a correlation between events in a series of successive sense impressions:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality#After_the_Middle_Ages

To this day skepticism of causality rationally triumphs over any argument, much to the chagrin of those who hold naturalist or positivist beliefs.

But there's another (very ancient) way to define causality, a more robust way which can stand up to most skeptics' attack **and which is not subject to the problem of induction**. And that is to define causality in terms of will (and will, subsequently, in terms of ""I""). This encompasses even the solipsists and other worldviews which deny the outside world or the natural world.

Here, let's take the experience of any given human being.
 
I am a human being. I think, I know the idea of ""I"" (I think, therefore I am). I'm sentient, conscious, etc.
 
I exist (passive). Existence is defined in terms of ""I"". I will (active). Will is also defined in terms of ""I"". When I *will* things, they pop into existence as thoughts. I define this relationship as *causality*. I am responsible for my willful thoughts. I *cause* them.
 
This is irrespective of the form or content of these thoughts which are taken from a steady stream of input from my senses as sense impressions. I will not address at this moment where these sense impressions come from or what they might describe or the reality of the things they describe. All I know is that *""I""* exist.

This is the only way I can think of to rationally define causality without having it torn up by any competent philosophical skeptic (especially a solipsist).

The first axiom to acknowledge in any form of rational ordering of thoughts is, of course, ""I"". I think, therefore I am. Existence, in whatever form it may be (not necessarily the existence of our physical bodies, but the ""I"" that thinks, *is*). Existence is the passive manifestation of ""I"" and will is the active manifestation of it (or if we wish to be traditional we can define both as properties of ""I""). There can be philosophical problems with ""properties"" though and it's just as easy to say they are passive and active manifestations of ""I"" because this is intuitively perceived and acknowledged.

Therefore by virtue of experience (of living and thinking), I must acknowledge the idea of ""cause"" and I cannot possibly define cause in any terms other than the will of a sentient/conscious entity (a mind or the mind).

**What use is such a definition?**

It can be used wherever natural/physical causality are used but to be so used would necessitate some metaphysical conclusions which otherwise can be ignored in a purely materialistic/naturalistic view of the world. So while it can be of much use and it is more robust, it will not appeal to the metaphysical beliefs of some.

Besides, ignoring things is irrational and bad philosophy.

On the other hand, those who do like such a definition will have a tightly organized and efficient rational process. Having to jump through some metaphysical hoops is not a knock on it, it only makes sense that we would need to address some metaphysical concerns when rationally addressing the external world (otherwise, you know, solipsism). At the very least it is more rationally stable foundation for addressing the natural world (as opposed to mere faith in habit as per Hume's definition). Actually, check that, it is *the most* rationally stable foundation because it uses the fewest number of universally accepted axioms to define causality.

**What metaphysical views does it necessitate?**

Metaphysics comes into play when one applies this idea of causality to our sensory input.

We can describe the external world as a product of our own mind or of another mind, as real (realism) or illusory (anti-realism). It's possible to arrange these metaphysical beliefs to believe in a real, external, physical, natural world... or even to believe that it is a computer simulation (the matrix).

Really, it doesn't do much that people don't already do except it forces people off the fence about metaphysics (thus anti-metaphysics people will not be happy, but who cares, they're engaging in purposeful ignorance which is irrational to begin with and irrationality is worse than incorrect rationality, the latter may at least be corrected).

**What about the free will vs. determinism debate?**

That doesn't really apply here. Whether one believes in free will or not, the rational analysis of the issue results in the acknowledgement of an understanding of the definition of causality and its relation to will even if one believes we only *potentially* have causal ability, they do acknowledge that this is tied to will.

The person who believes in some amount of free will, however imperceptible, would say we have *actual* causal ability as per the above example with our thoughts. The person who believes we have no free will whatsoever will have to acknowledge that they understand the definition of causality in terms of will for *if* our wills were free we would have causal responsibility over our thoughts, so if our wills are not free they must of necessity be slaved to another actually free will since cause necessitates will somewhere up the chain of responsibility.

I'm 22 and living at my parents place after graduating and not being able to land a job. They're pretty cool with anything I do (I don't do much. I usually drink at friend's house and don't do drugs since I always get really bad trips).

One thing they cannot stand is that I don't have a religion. They are Christians and they say that they would be fine with any established religion (i.e. no Pastafarian or Invisible Pink Unicorn).

I am interested in religion as a part of human culture. It's fascinating that people have formed their own religions and have many ideas about how the world was created. Also, I think religion texts can have deep messages that believers and non-believers alike can learn from. I'm just really uncomfortable with worshipping/praying god (e.g. singing, fervent prayers, etc). 

Is there a religion that focuses more on the nature of religion and how one should live one's life rather than how to become a good Christian/muslim/etc? It's a pretty unrealistic request since a lot of religion revolves around believing in a certain god and doing as the religious texts dictates. 

I took a seminar on various religions and found taoism and even buddhism to be quite interesting since it's more about how one should conduct oneself without overly religious bearings. It almost seemed more like a philosophy than a religion.

I do object to new age “knowledge,” but no more strongly than any metaphysics (which by definition can only be considered hypothetically). 

But to return to morality, it seems entirely possible that morality when properly understood could be rather like math. There just might be certain justifiable normative relationships between different instances of consciousness depending on the given species driven necessities.

After hearing a lot of people talk about this whole higher power/super consciousness soup thing, I have an opinion. New age spiritualists (along with some old) are basically talking about the christian god minus the spiteful revenge. Its the same crusty old bastard he is just called consciousness and became genderless along the way (but he still has a beard). What they are talking about is an agent. I haven’t talked to a single person who holds to this super consciousness that isn’t, in the end, talking about a super agent. Most people don’t even have a fucking clue what consciousness is.

Here a list of various definitions of the singularity:

http://www.singularitysymposium.com/definition-of-singularity.html 

But it’s basically a collection of concepts related to uninterrupted exponential technological growth. One of the predecessor phrases was “intelligence explosion.” 

First I’m saying that I think exponential technological growth is not only possible but real. The next step I’m taking is putting that possibility in context. If the singularity CAN happen, maybe in the entire history of existence singularities have ALREADY happened. This line of reasoning makes the simulation hypothesis seem even more plausible (that our reality is software running on a higher order reality). And it is really only in the context of the simulation hypothesis that I can make new-agey metaphysical concepts sound remotely reasonable in my mind. 

So if our universe or multiverse is a simulation running on a higher order operating system it’s theoretically possible that that higher order reality has become saturated with consciousness, i.e. become one conscious network. And it is in that sense that consciousness could lie before and underneath our universe. 

That said, I don’t think any of the above are necessary to explain subjective states of conscious experience that would give one the desire to say that the above new age-y concepts are true (regardless of their ability to point to states of conscious experience that could be demonstrably preferable to live in).Yesterday at 4:35pm · Like

 
Tj x: But yeah people are talking about a super-agent. Which I tend to agree is superficially ridiculous, and just plain wrong the way most people must conceptualize it. But I also think that humans have the ability to become/create a super-agent. So if there isn’t already “God” i think it’s really only a matter of time.

I think you’re wrong about the material limits and the information processing limits. I’d have to review Kurzweil’s book before I could get back to you with a robust response.

 

I never said anything about the virtual world being conscious of itself yet. I definitely think that our universe mustn’t be aware of itself as a whole.

If what is outside of our virtual reality is unsurpassed consciousness then the simulation hypothesis becomes a form of panintheism.Yesterday at 6:17pm · Like

1344405897.0,0,self.PhilosophyofReligion,xva23,A Question on the Persistence of Consciousness Assuming the Existence of God ,,2,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/xva23/a_question_on_the_persistence_of_consciousness/,"Note: I have never before posted to a philosophy or theology subreddit, and my level of experience with both topics is limited to the few college classes I have taken and some reading I have done lately. My familiarity with proper terminology will likely reflect this, and so I apologize preemptively for any errors I may make.

I was born and raised in an very devoted Catholic family. As I grew up and went through high school and college, I began to come up with what you might call thought experiments, that ultimately raised many questions about theology and philosophy, one of which has been bothering me a great deal lately. I will attempt to lay out the basis for the question as I conceive it.

Assume first that God exists as described by a general Christian consensus. My question does not hinder so much on the technicality of a description of God's characteristics or intentions, so long as Godself is basically described by Christianity. 

[1] God Exists, as described by Christian Theology

Next, assume that heaven is a place (I do not necessarily mean in a physical sense, in the same way that New York is a place). Heaven has the following characteristics, as written in the Wikipedia description of Heaven by Christianity (found here -&gt;  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven#Christianity): 

""The term Heaven is applied by the Bible to the realm in which God currently resides. Eternal life, by contrast, occurs in a renewed, unspoilt and perfect creation, which can be termed Heaven since God will choose to dwell there permanently with his people, as seen in Revelation 21:3. That there will no longer be any separation between God and man. The believers themselves will exist in incorruptible, resurrected and new bodies; there will be no sickness, no death and no tears. Some teach that death itself is not a natural part of life, but was allowed to happen after Adam and Eve disobeyed God (see Original Sin) so that mankind would not live forever in a state of sin and thus a state of separation from God.[26][27][28]""

I understand this to imply that Heaven is necessarily a place void of sin. Thus:

[2] Heaven is a place void of sin.

Next, I operate under the belief that contrast between things like “right” and “wrong” or “good” and “evil” give each its meaning. I know there is a metaphysical term for this, but I cannot figure out what it is called. What I am trying to say is that, without “evil,” “good” necessarily is not realized. There cannot exist something a polar opposite if the idea or thing at the other extreme does not exist.

[3] Awareness of opposite modes gives each mode a meaning.

Next, assume that free will exists as defined by the Catholic Church.

[4] Humans have free will 

Next, I believe that free will is necessarily dependent on an understanding of opposites. That is to say, it is the distinction between “right” and “wrong” that makes possible the opportunity for a human to freely choose between the two.

[5] Free will depends on a clear distinction between opposite modes

Next, I assume the consciousness is defined in its standard sense.

[6] Humans are conscious, which is to say that they are self-aware.

Lastly, assume that our consciousness is dependent, at least partially, on the choices we make throughout our lives. Or, perhaps a better way of saying this would be: who I am, is dependent on the choices I have made in the past. Who we are, is a result of how we have acted in the past (at least partially). Also, some choices, because we are operating under the assumption that God exists, necessarily have a “right” and “wrong” answer. That is to say, premise [1] requires that sin is defined by God, and thus certain choices may lead to sin, which is wrong. Thus, at least some of the choices we have made in the past that have given each of us our consciousness, are dependent on the outcome of a potentially right or wrong choice.

[7] Some choices humans make have a right and wrong outcome, as dictated by God.

[8] Human consciousness and awareness of oneself is dependent upon the choices we make.

[9] Some element of human consciousness and awareness of oneself is dependent upon the difference between right and wrong.

Now, finally, I can ask my question:

If who I am is characterized by the choices I have made, and said choices exist because of a duality between opposite modes (right vs wrong), how then can the traditional description of heaven be compatible with the persistence of my consciousness after death? That is, if heaven is void of sin, and sin is, at least in part, responsible for the distinction between right and wrong, or good and evil, then how then can I truly exist as I am in awareness of myself today? If I have no knowledge of evil, then there exists only right choices, which is, in my mind, the equivalent of removing free will. Alternatively, if I do have knowledge of evil in heaven, but am completely prevented from choosing to act evil, then again, there exists no free will in heaven. Lastly, if there exists the knowledge of evil in heaven, AND I have the ability to make a choice between evil and good, then while It may be possible to retain my consciousness of myself, heaven would not be void of sin.
Thus, I have come across a paradox, for which I am struggling to find resources to answer or read more about.

I recently tried out a Saturday service (christian, and I am non denominational) that was at some couples house about 60 miles away. I did not know that the teacher claimed to have prophetic gifts or that he would try to prophesize to me, as I believed it was just a regular in depth study. This man was a complete strange to me, as was everyone in the house. I merely traded names and what city I lived in with him before we started. Near the end of the service he looks at me in the eyes and says ""(my name), God wants you in the military."" When he said that, my heart dropped to the floor, as I had told myself for years the military would never see me in service. He then said he felt that I have had pressure on me from a young age to join the military. I confirmed this, as each first son on my mothers side has always enlisted in the USMC. He then shook his head and said ""you're not going to be in the marines."" This really shook me because no matter how hard i try to resist the military, I've always felt that boyish attraction to being a soldier and fighting. I've always resisted because of my disagreements with the direction our country is headed in terms of foreign affairs and ""peace keeping missions"". But it really hit me when he said he saw the blue colors, that I would be in either the navy or most likely the air force. The one thing i have always been interested in is aviation. He began to talk about how my plans were not to have a target on my back but to be a leader, that I am very intelligent and dot my i's and cross my t's, which again are truths coming from a complete stranger. He told me I was made to be an officer and that God would use me to change the world.
So my question to you is this: do you believe in such prophecies? Why or why not? Have you had a similar experience? I could have gone into further detail but it is long as it is. The fact is, this man, a complete stranger who didn't even know my age happened to know so much about me, and that it seemed as though he was speaking not as him but as a mouthpiece for God himself, talking to my soul.",,False,,t5_2sfeh,False,,,True,t3_xr4b8,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/xr4b8/do_you_believe_in_phrophetic_gifts_given_to/,

1341720176.0,0,self.PhilosophyofReligion,w7igh,God's existence debate: How should I have handled myself?,patefoisgras,1,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/w7igh/gods_existence_debate_how_should_i_have_handled/,"I thought that I would throw some easily attackable arguments--e.g. Cosmological, Ontological, and the like--out there to promote critical thinking, as well as challenging some popular misconceptions. I would think I prepared myself more or less adequately to deal with what the common folks could come up with in a rational manner, but apparently I didn't do good enough a job.

I got sidetracked by the classic ""Can God create a stone he cannot lift?"" loaded question fallacy. My first reaction was to show why it's a fallacy before pointing out that it is one. Some attempts quoted below.

I felt that I couldn't back away, or the atheists would have another case of arguers of this topic picking and choosing what they'd respond to.

So, how could I have done better?

Exhibit 1:

&gt;I anticipated as much. I don't expect you to accept that that argument is bogus, but consider this:

&gt;- How much force do you have to exert to lift a rock of weight A (Newton)? F &gt; A, evidently.

&gt;- How much force do you have to exert to lift a rock of infinite weight, which we take for granted to be produced by God? F &gt; infinity, evidently.

&gt;When you can get back to me how to make sense of a quantity larger than infinity, I'll accept the argument as sensible.

&gt;The contradiction here does not lay with God's all-powerfulness, but with the idea in the argument itself. In so far as we still use reason to comprehend God, we cannot go beyond the bound of what actually makes sense to us. A quantity larger than infinity is nonsense.

Exhibit 2:

&gt; By defining the object as ""so heavy it cannot be lifted"", the argument is already loaded inside it a condition that the defender has no choice but to accept. Can such a thing exist in as much as reason can make sense of it? Can I ask then ""Can God make purple run fast?"" and expect it to make sense? Purple does not run, let alone fast. A ""rock that cannot be lifted with infinite strength"" is an inherently flawed definition.

Exhibit 3:

&gt; How do you defend the self-contradictory definition of a ""stone heavier than can be lifted""? And to put things into perspective, these are the relevant arguments:

&gt; 1. If God is omnipotent, then he can make object A

&gt; 2. He cannot make object A

&gt; 3. Therefore he is not omnipotent

&gt; Classic modus tollens.

&gt; Counterargument: Object A doesn't even make sense, so it doesn't make any sense to talk about God being capable of creating it. As such, the premise of the argument is flawed in the way that it can't be entertained sensibly, not in the way that it is factually false. The argument is thus scrapped.

Exhibit 4: 

&gt; Because you're already assuming the answer in the question. I'll point it out: The rock gets heavier approaching the point of god being unable to lift it until it becomes so heavy that he can't.

&gt; This sentence assumes a few things, but let's get right to the meat of the matter:

&gt; 1. It assumes that such a thing has the property of existence.

&gt; 2. It assumes that there is a point that God cannot lift.

&gt; ""Have you stopped being a douche?"" cannot be answered in such a way that contradicts the assumption that the person has in fact been a douche. The normal response is to correct the questioner: ""I have not been a douche."" and not give an answer. The same applies here.

&gt; We're trying to define God using reason, so omnipotence works on everything that is sensibly imaginable and none otherwise. I might have neglected to point out, but language is hardly rational. Something like ""Can he do X"" sounds nice because it starts with ""Can he"", implying--linguistically--an ability or lack thereof. Rationally, there is no ability concerning objects that don't even make sense from the start.

Later in the book, Adler attempts to prove the necessity of God as creator, and preserver. I think he proves God's necessity as creator quite well, but my question concerns that preserver aspect.

He mentions the principle of inertia, that an object that is at rest stays at rest, and that an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. Adler then applies this to the existence of the cosmos, that an object in existence stays in existence. As such, the cosmos in existence stays in existence. Adler says that IF the cosmos was created by God, this inertia of being is sufficient to explain the continuing existence of the cosmos, and nullifying the notion of God being a preserver. 

Adler then goes on, simply saying that the principle of inertia cannot be applied to the cosmos in order to continue his ""things that are possible to be, can also possibly cease to be"" idea. I don't really see why he rejects the principle of cosmological inertia so dismissively.

Many people ( such as empiricists) use the fact that we appear to be unable to detect or measure God or anything spiritual as proof that it does not exist, but I have formed an analogy that aims to explains this. Imagine a fish, swimming in its stereotypical fish bowl. It can see the little castle and the pebbles at the bottom of the bowl but, what it cannot see, is what surrounds it, the water. The fish cannot see the water because, ironically, the fish always sees the water.The water the fish lives in is what God is to us and if we were to step back from our view we would realise that we cannot see God or the holy spirit because we are utterly immersed in it, it is everyone and everything that there ever is was or will be. If instead of using microscopes and machines to study tiny details of the world trying to, for example, find the hig's boson particle and simply step back it would become apparent that the whole time we have been missing what is right in front of us. The fish, if intelligent enough, could have studied each pebble at the bottom of its bowl individually looking for the source of its life, and would never be able to conclude its submersion in water unless a simple step back was took.

I a bisexual, and this question is extremely important to me. Of course, I have also asked if we believe our beliefs to be true, what's stopping us from punishing, imprisoning, or harming others that do not believe the same way we do?",,False,,t5_2sfeh,False,,,True,t3_nlb1f,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/nlb1f/if_homosexuality_is_objectively_immoral_does_it/,

A lot of Christians I've met have believed that the devil is a man with red skin, horns, and a tail. My question is how do they know this? Of course I think most of them would say that there are pictures that show what the devil looks like. But that's basically media concepts. I think they need to know the difference between Christianity as is explained in the Bible and Christian Media Concepts. Is there a description on what Satan looks like in the Bible? If not, then how do we come to the conclusion on what Satan looks like? I think personally, is that the devil may not look like a man with red skin, a tail, and horns. Satan could look like someone like you or me. I think that is something that Christians made up, taken from Pagans, to discourage Paganism. The devil, according to christian media concepts, looks just like the Horned God of Pagans. But the problem is the Pagans established the Horned God before Christians said it was the devil. So how can the Horned God be the devil? It is basically an attack on Paganism, and I think Christians know better, or at least should, than to assume that.",,False,,t5_2sfeh,True,,,True,t3_nhf1h,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofReligion/comments/nhf1h/what_does_satan_really_look_like/,

Sure, I've been very much influenced by religious philosophers and theologians who were working solely within a given religious tradition but I've also been infleunced by secular thinkers as well so I draw my inspiration from a wide base.But let me get to the point.Religion has its positive and negative manifestations, we all know that. But what I tend to deprecate the most about certain forms of religion is the exclusivity and prestigiousness to which they insist upon. It's this mentality that there is only one path to God, all others are mere snares and traps and failure to recognize this will only lead to negative consequences.Now from my little exposure to this subreddit I can see it's full of some very intelligent people and I haven't come across anyone yet who thinks like this.But let me raise this question as a final point.If we agree that there are a multiplicity of paths towards recognizing that which is sacred and that we simply pick which works best for us then why associate ourselves with the label ""religious""? Does spiritual not work better, doesn't it seem to have less negative connotations? I'm just wondering on what you all think.
