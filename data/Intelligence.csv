&gt;Any ideas how they got to the shopping center? Maybe a cab driver
&gt;talked? Only need to connect one person to make the dots come together.

&gt;right, but there was no inherent connection between the hotel and the
&gt;shopping center that I could see. In order to run TrapWire, you first
&gt;have to have the images to analyze - I'm curious as to who decided to
&gt;look at the shopping center tapes and how they determined that it needed
&gt;to be looked at.
&gt;In general, this just seems too good to be true. Either Dubai police
&gt;department are a bunch of bad-asses or someone got help.

&gt;
&gt;One thing I was talking to Bayless about just now: I realize that there
&gt;is now face recognition technology out there that would allow the
&gt;Emirates to track these people, but in order to use that, you have to
&gt;have the right set of images to work from in the first place.
&gt;Running analysis at the airport makes sense because the team would have
&gt;scanned their passports there and so had to have gone through the
&gt;airport. Same for the hotels, authorities would have been able to place
&gt;the team members at each hotel based on their passports, which would
&gt;help specify which video to analyze.
&gt;However, I don't understand how they got video of the team going into
&gt;the shopping center. Out of all the random places that the team
&gt;could've met, what prompted the police to check that shopping center?
&gt;Either they ran checks on hundreds of other CCTV tapes or they somehow
&gt;had a tip that the team was meeting at the mall.

----

&gt;*Fred Burton wrote:*
&gt;
&gt;Yes, I think as you break down the tape, the teams had specific roles.
&gt;If host country intelligence and/or another service picked up on them,
&gt;they had enough players in the mix to send any surveillance team down a
&gt;rat hole. I think we are missing something on the dead guy.

&gt;17 people for a hit leaves so many opportunities for failure that its
&gt;breathtaking. Maybe it is the Israelis, but that is way out of the
&gt;box. Like I said, I wonder how many were camo. I bet you some of those
&gt;who resolved back to the Israeli passport holders weren't even aware
&gt;there was a hit on. That much razzle dazzle might mean a small team
&gt;hidden in a big box.

&gt;
&gt;When you break down the video tape, efforts were made by the hit team to
&gt;conceal their identities from the video.
&gt; 
&gt;The operation was worked around the video tape I think.
&gt; 
&gt;Between 13-15 men were in play; multiple surveillance teams; hand offs,
&gt;clothing changes; wigs, toupees, cover for action.
&gt; 
&gt;Mossad has made several tactical errors in the past, to include the loss
&gt;of two Palestinian double agents in Europe.
&gt; 
&gt;They had the same passport foul up on the attempt to poison Mishaal in
&gt;Amman, which led to them being caught.
&gt; 
&gt;Frankly, Mossad has a history of bungled operations, but quite a few
&gt;good ones, like Ali Hassan Salameh. 
&gt;  
&gt;This was Mossad.

&gt;
&gt;A Mossad team would be extremely aware of placement of security
&gt;cameras. They would not be doing what this woman did. She is to a
&gt;great extent blown now. Major intelligence agencies would be able to do
&gt;biometrics on her pretty effectively. An agent competent enough to
&gt;participate in an assassination of a HVT in an Arab country would be
&gt;highly trained and prized. So from this we can assume that she is
&gt;either a throwaway in the team or that this isn't a major league
&gt;hit--and it was. The Israelis did not need to make this appear to be an
&gt;Israeli hit because everyone would assume that it was Israeli anyway. No
&gt;need for confirmation. For a hit like this the passports used would
&gt;have been much harder to trace, certainly not to living people in
&gt;Israel. The Israelis, like all intelligence organizations, maintain
&gt;libraries of properly aged identities that don't resolve to living
&gt;people.
&gt; 
&gt;Either this was not an Israeli hit or the Israelis sent a second tier
&gt;team. The women looks like she could be Jewish, but she could also be
&gt;middle eastern or American.
&gt;This hit, like some other allegedly Israeli hits in recent years, does
&gt;not follow high professional standards. Trust me on this--the hotel in
&gt;which this woman stayed was mapped out months ago, probably from blue
&gt;prints but certainly remapped for security devices and cameras. She was
&gt;briefed (pounded into her head) where the cameras were and to turn her
&gt;head as she walked by, preferably wearing a dress that hid her figure--a
&gt;blob on the video camera. Instead, she is hamming it up. Looking at
&gt;her, she wasn't the honey trap, so what the hell is going on?

&gt;As Posey works on the piece from the tactical angle, I wanted to bring
&gt;up the political angle. Now that all kinds of information has come
&gt;out on the assassination of Hamas operative Al-Mabhouh in Dubai on
&gt;Jan. 19, European governments are starting to question the fraudulent
&gt;use of their passports. 6 British, 3 Irish, 1 German and 1 French
&gt;passports were all faked/stolen/borrowed and then used by the
&gt;assassination team. NYT/Dubai says there were another 6 involved, who
&gt;they probably didn't get on camera.
&gt;Israel has in the past borrowed/acquired passports from immigrated or
&gt;dual-citizens of other countries (like Canada for failed Meshaal
&gt;assassination). They also can fake them or steal them. It's becoming
&gt;clear that this was a Mossad op, so if we make that assumption, what's
&gt;the blowback on Israel?

**If you're looking to understand PSYOPS** then this is the guy to hear it from... here's his ""about the author"" section from the hardcover version of the book on Amazon:

Jason Meszaros has 15 years of military experience as an Intelligence and Psychological Operations Officer. He has received the Bronze Star Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. As an Army Intelligence Officer, Capt. Meszaros was assigned to a task force investigating Al Qaeda and the Taliban. In Operation Noble Eagle, he worked in the Washington, D.C., area with federal law enforcement agents on the investigations of detainees and was a liaison to the Central Intelligence Agency. As part of that assignment, he traveled to Guantanamo Bay and viewed the interrogation of detainees. Capt. Meszaros traveled to Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom in 2004 and supported the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force. While in Afghanistan, he participated in the interrogation of numerous senior Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, including the man who led Osama bin Laden out of Tora Bora in December 2001, a senior Al Qaeda operative for Southeast Asia, and others. During this time, he participated in highly classified missions targeting senior Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders such as Roze Khan, a.k.a. the Taliban Billy the Kid, as featured on CBS's 60 Minutes. Capt. Meszaros's most important mission was documenting the Al Qaeda training camps (Al Farouq and Tarnak Farms) where numerous 9/11 hijackers received terrorist training in small arms, poisons, bomb-making, assassinations, and counter-interrogation. Capt. Meszaros was a member of the only unit in the Army that specializes in Psychological Operations (PSYOP) with enemy prisoners of war, and he led a team comprised of analysts, product development specialists, and interrogators. He deployed to Bosnia in support of Operation Joint Forge and traveled extensively throughout the country. He has received training at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, PSYOP Officer Training, and numerous trainings as an Intelligence Officer.

as I am making my way within the intelligence community on my own means, I could not but notice the myriads of acronyms listed as job requirements by prospective employers.

Although I am already ""functioning"" semi-officially but wholeheartedly as an intelligence analyst, I thought it is high time that I got certified. 

I want to apply for a job post at a private intelligence firm and so far I came up with training courses provided by http://www.riscuk.com and www.ialeia.org. Which one to chose?

Any other suggestions or further comment on my career path would be highly appreciated fellow analysts!

Also, from what I understand, the Analyst's Notebook from IBM seems to be popular for intel analysis. What do you think of that?

I have a deep interest in learning foreign languages, which I would imagine to be valuable on a more international scale. I'm not sure what other skills would be potentially valuable, so I'm not sure what else to include.

I've always had an interest in working in intelligence (analysis, not field ops), but always assumed that my citizenship (Irish) would rule this out as a possibility.

From what's in the public domain, Ireland doesn't really seem to have (or need to have) any dedicated intel agency like other countries, but rather intelligence-gathering is handled by a a small, dedicated branch of our military - G2 - and of our police force - Special Branch/SDU.

What intel jobs, in other countries, would not be citizenship dependent?

After 9/11 the FBI believed it could alter its intelligence program to be proactive (e.g. focus on counterterrorism investigations instead of methamphetamine); but many outside the agency thought it would be more efficient if we took the British approach and created a MI5, if you will, and let the FBI just focus on law enforcement. 

I've read some old interviews on the topic, [complied by PBS](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/sleeper/fbi/mi5.html) and a brief [NY Times article by a Georgetown professor](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/18/opinion/how-to-split-up-the-bipolar-fbi.html) but I'm curious to hear your perspectives.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-20078320

This is a serious affront to the concept of national sovereignty, Argentina should respond. International law allows for it, as far as I understand. The US would never allow such a thing, because:

1: The seizure of  military assets by agents of a foreign power (military, police, or government) constitute an act of military aggression. A military response is justified. 

2: Most countries can only be sued in their own courts. Any ruling made in a Ghanaian court should be therefore invalid vis-a-vis  deciding the ownership of Argentina military vessels.  

3: The defaulted sovereign debt was probably issued under Argentine law. That would make its either the default or the 30% restructuring perfectly legal. *This is why sovereign debt carries a risk premium in the first place*

If I were the Argentine president, I'd send in the Argentine special forces.

Ghanian military personnel would be neutralized unless they surrendered immediately, and the boat taken out to sea.  Uninvolved civilians aboard would be put ashore, but registered and declared ""persona non grata"", preventing them from ever entering Argentina, or its embassies abroad. Civilians in the employ of the creditor would be arrested are tried in Buenos Aires on international piracy charges using the definition of pirates established under law of the sea.  Surrendered Ghanaian military personnel should be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention. 

Then, the creditor should be charged in court over the incident in as many countries as possible. 

Of course, if I were going do all of that, I'd fist evacuate all crew, then loudly protest Ghana's actions, exactly as Argentina has done so far...to get as many people out of harm's way as possible, and then give Ghana the chance to resolve things peacefully before Argentina special forces swung into action.

I'm a former NSA Agent and I'll take you inside for free!

My semi-autobiographical novel Amor Vincit Omnia: an Andrew Valquist Adventure (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AV0RIAE/) is free on Kindle through July 22.

I was an Arabic linguist at the National Security Agency from 2002 to 2006, during which time I also earned the Global War on Terrorism Civilian Service Medal for service performed in Iraq in 2004.

Using my first-hand knowledge of the work spaces and mission at the NSA, I authentically depict the environment there.

In this novel, you will follow a new employee at the NSA as he enters that building and starts his Top Secret work. But Dr. Valquist is quickly thrust into international intrigue on just his second day on the job!

Amor Vincit Omnia is Latin for ""Love Conquers All."" You might ask, what's Love got to do with it? The answer ... Everything.

Still a decent overview of the threat to information security nation-state actors pose, regarding both governmental and corporate entities. I do not believe that this indicates anyone foreign ever broken into an A-Space enclave, most of the breaches seem to have been into corporations and lower security facilities.

The danger posed by such actors as snowden is much greater to such highly secure systems. If he was IA level III certified, or stole such credentials, he may well have details regarding the network structure or software/hardware configuration. Given this information, it's much easier to pinpoint vulnerabilities and design exploits.

A leak of such data poses a very great risk to the integrity of the infrastructure itself, and could require a complete restructuring to ensure security. The diplomatically embarrassing PRISM leaks are more attention whoring-if this kind of data is the ""insurance"" he speaks of, release of it could be the single most damaging event to the US intelligence community as a whole.

An interesting piece on the ""Al-anbar Awakening.""  I was actually in Anbar when this was going on and it is always interesting for me to read about it.  I actually had Chai with Sheikh Abdel Sattar during this.  We called him the Mob Boss because of the control he had over the fighters.

Just a quick question to throw out there for anyone who might be interested or might know something...

I received two hits on a no-volume website 

One terminates at a bluecoat proxy on Fort Eustis, home to the 480th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing (8.28.16.0)

The other terminates at an ADSL line in Chaguanas, Trinidad and Tobago (190.58.217.108)

The hits happen at the same time and are typical of bots testing for non-robots.txt filtering of web crawlers.

Do I need to be worried?
