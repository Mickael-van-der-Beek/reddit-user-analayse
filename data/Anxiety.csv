things we are trying to do all the time:

* be safe

things we can’t help but do all the time:

* second-guess ourselves
* behave impulsively and reactively
* take everything personally
* worry
* have difficulty accepting compliments
* have difficulty reciprocating friendly gestures
* worry
* have difficulty finding the courage to respond
* have difficulty not being suspicious of others’ intentions
* worry
* make a huge deal out of the smallest thing
* think we're bothering you

things you should keep in mind:

* we’re scared of everything
* pretty much all of the time
* it’s an actual disorder
* it manifests as impulsive behavior
* you can’t fix us with words
* telling us “worrying is silly” won’t make us stop worrying
* it’ll only make us feel silly
* and then we’ll worry even more
* “oh god, am i worrying too much? what if they call me silly again?”
* like that
* also, we wear a lot of armor
* cold, heavy, affection-proof armor with spikes
* we constructed this armor as children
* we’re fairly certain you will never be able to pry it apart
* but there is a nice person under there, we promise

things you can do for a friend with an anxiety disorder:

* stick around
* ask them if they’re comfortable in a place or situation
* be willing to change the place or situation if not
* activities that help them take their mind off of things are good!
* talk to them even when they might not talk back
(they’re probably too afraid to say the wrong thing)
* try not to take their reactions (or lack thereof) personally
(the way they expresses themself is distorted and bent because of their constant fear)
(and they know this)
* give them time to respond to you
* they will obsess over how they are being interpreted
* they will anticipate being judged
* it took me four hours just to type this much
* even though i sound casual
* that’s because i have an anxiety disorder

things you shouldn’t do:

* tell us not to worry
* tell us we’ll be fine
* mistake praise for comfort
* ask us if we are “getting help”
* force us to be social
* force us to do things that trigger us
* “face your fears” doesn’t always work
* because—remember—scared of everything
* in fact, it would be more accurate to say we are scared of the fear itself

emergency action procedure for panic attacks:

* be calm
* be patient
* don’t be condescending
* remind us that we’re not “crazy”
* sit with us
* ask us to tighten and relax our muscles one by one
* remind us that we are breathing
* engage us in a discussion (if we can talk, then we can breathe)
* if we are having trouble breathing, try getting us to exhale slowly
* (it will be harder for us to exhale than inhale)
* (sometimes all it takes is our body to realize it can push the air back out)
* or breathe through our nose
* or have us put our hands on our stomach to feel each breath
* or have us put a hand on your chest and breath with you
* ask us what needs to change in our environment in order for us to feel safe
* help us change it
* usually, just knowing that we have someone on our side willing to fight our scary monsters with us is enough to calm us down

if you have an anxiety disorder:

* it’s okay.
* even if you worry that it’s not okay.
* it’s still okay. it’s okay to be scared. it’s okay to be scared of being scared.
* you are not crazy. you are not a freak.
* I know there’s a person under all that armor.
* and i know you feel isolated because of it.
* I won’t make you take it off.
* but know that you are not alone.

1351816916.0,301,self.Anxiety,12hm02,"A letter to anyone who doesn't understand Panic &amp; Anxiety. It saves time, and the stress of re-writing it...",degenerateFTW,331,30,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/12hm02/a_letter_to_anyone_who_doesnt_understand_panic/,"There are some things I want you to know about me and my condition.

I am not necessarily shy, that's not what having a panic disorder is. I am an outgoing person who often feels trapped inside a wall of fear. I get really angry sometimes because what I feel like is the real me is trapped behind my anxiety. I probably want to be affectionate and laid back and fun at any given time but you make me nervous. It's not your fault, it's just people- it's nothing you do or did. I can only become desensitized to people by spending a lot of time with them and even then sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes, with some people, it works right away.

I know that what I'm afraid of isn't real. I know that the threat is an illusion and that I'm not really going to get hurt, but my body is telling me otherwise. I try to talk myself out of it but ""fight or flight"" is one of the most basic and powerful instincts of the body, and it doesn't always listen.

I am working really hard to combat my anxiety disorder. Some days I start to give up because I've been fighting for so long and it doesn't seem to change, or I make progress and then I backslide. It's inevitable that I get depressed and may not seem to be working to help myself. Having an anxiety disorder is really hard and I promise I'm doing what I can. Much of the fight that goes on with my condition happens inside the head, so while it might not seem like I am trying to help myself, I am.

I am constantly exhausted. If your body went through intense terror each day (or sometimes, just from time-to-time) and then crashed, you'd be exhausted too. I have to make myself move when I am crashing and sometimes I just have to sleep. My body doesn't present that as an option; it's just an order- ""You. Sleep. Now"". Sometimes I don't get things done because I am tired. Please don't get mad at me if I don't always do everything I am supposed to do- it can be a real struggle to do little things that most people don't think twice about, like walking into a store, running errands, sometimes even leaving my house.

Some of my behavior might seem pretty odd at times. I might make someone go with me to places I ought to be able to go to alone because I need a ""safe"" person there. I might come off as clingy and dependent on others, but my reasoning is not what you might assume- ""safe"" people are our anchors to sanity. Real or not, we assume we can count on them to help us if we become terrified, and that can make the difference between fleeing a place or being able to stick it out. We develop triggers in specific places and that place, as innocuous as it might seem to you, scares me to death. I don't want to feel that way; it's embarrassing, but I do. How would you feel if you were terrified out of your mind in a place or around a person you know is harmless in your heart?

I try many things to combat my anxiety. If you've heard about a technique, I've probably heard about it. I've tried meditation, yoga, acupuncture, keeping active, positive self-talk, cognitive behavioral therapy, regular therapy, and medication, among things. I've probably tried lots of different medication. Anxiety disorder (and depression, since the two are linked- you'd be depressed if you had an anxiety disorder) often get treated with strong medication, and strong medication has side-effects. When I am trying new medications I might be ""off"" and irrational. Please forgive me, it's not me, it's the meds. Also, some meds make me extra tired or dizzy or any number of other things that aren't my normal or desired state. Most medication used to treat anxiety is something the body becomes immune to over time, so the dosage must be increased. So, occasionally I may relapse when I am not expecting it. I don't necessarily know the cause.

Please don't make fun of me when I am experiencing a panic attack- it's horrible enough without you ridiculing me. You wouldn't be laughing if you were the one whose body was revolting in fear. I'm not making anything up, I'm not trying to use panic attacks as an excuse not to do things, and I surely don't want to be a burden on you or effect your life negatively. Knowing I sometimes am and sometimes do adds to the misery of the condition. What I really need is for you to let me hold your hand or your arm tightly at times, and to humor me and just tell me it isn't real and I don't have to be scared, even if it's the millionth time you've said it. Tell me you'll protect me and I might just believe you, because I want to so badly. I want to be tough and independent and in control, but something (psychological and chemical) inside of me won't let me be free.

Panic disorders are almost always genetic and are chemically related, though they're often triggered by a traumatic event. Before realizing what is happening to us, most panic disorder sufferers go through a terrible period of thinking that we're dying when we're having a panic attack, or that something terrible is about to happen to us, etc. It's impossible to understand when it first happens, unless someone is there to warn you. There usually isn't.

Many of us live in terror of letting other people know we're freaking out, so while we might seem normal, in control, and calm, our insides are often a different story. It's ok to tell us we seem stabler or more confident- we'll appreciate you noticing. Just know that sometimes it might be an illusion, sometimes true one day but not the next. Acting like it's a result of something we didn't do is a double-blow, the first one being our own senses of failure for not being able to just ""tough it out"", ""grin and bear it"" etc.

Sometimes, just walking into a room by ourselves is the accomplishment of the day. Sometimes, we could lead a parade. Please, give us the credit for living with something so tough and managing to do anything. Please, just support us and help us, and listen to us. It's natural to get annoyed sometimes, but if you're annoyed, we're probably beating ourselves up because we're a self-critical lot. That's part of how we got this way, by being too self-aware.

I typed a long response for him and, as luck would have it, lost the response. So I decided to visit here and share my development

I am male and have the background probably most of you have
1) Super anxious mother, absent dad. No one to turn to when I couldn't take my mom anymore. She did a lot of things that didn't exactly have the outcome of, er, pacifying my anxiety.
2) Terrified of talking to girls
3) Might as well have gotten my doctorate for all the research I did into anxiety and all the rumination I expended on. For long stretches, EVERY. WAKING. THOUGHT. of mine was about how to outsmart or out-think or manage my anxiety.
4) Enormously self-critical of my performance and my anxiety and my thinking
5) Fundamentally unhappy even though I came to develop compensatory behaviors which fooled a lot of people into thinking I was confident.

I'm not going to spend anymore time discussing the ways I suffered over the years for brevity's sake. If you are interested, go ahead and ask :)

Now on to how I overcame anxiety

As I said above, I spent many years researching and ruminating and plotting/developing compensatory behaviors for my anxiety. About a year ago, as part of this neverending search, I came across a book named Search Inside Yourself by Chade Meng Tan. It introduced me to mindfulness from a neuroscientific/practical benefit perspective. For someone with a hyper critical mind, I think its emphasis really suited my need for specific outcomes and efficacy data.

And so I began to meditate. Being brash, I started off meditating for an hour and spent the hour being utterly frustrated and incensed at myself for not being able to pay any quality attention to my breath. But the next morning, I swear, the world looked more garish, more vibrant. I was sold. 

Over the next couple of months I would continue these hour-long sits in which I would spend 80-90% of the time running the mental treadmill over these thoughts ""I don't know if I'm doing this right. This doesn't feel right. I think if I pay attention to the vibration of the breath in my nostrils I'll be able to stay mindful for longer. No.. that didn't work. Dammit! Why isn't this working?"" Sitting turned into a deeply unhappy, hyper-critical time in which I obsessed more about whether I was meditating correctly, or how I could meditate better, than actually, you know, meditating. 

I can't even say that I was being diligent in the frequency of my meditation. Over the last year, I've meditated an average of one day a week - maybe. A stretch of 3-5 days followed by some life disruption (usually tiredness) and then 2 weeks off. But I did try during my waking hours to pay attention to my breath whenever I could. Ironically, this meant that I carried the same hyper-criticism and dissatisfaction and unhappiness into even neutral activities. But, in retrospect, it did provide a diversion from my usual, *consuming*, habit of ruminating all day everyday about my anxiety.

During driving, during conversations with my mom, and so on I would try to come back to the breath. The intention and determination to stay mindful was always there and I can't precisely explain why. After maybe 5 or 6 months I noticed that my mind was getting quieter. I used to talk in my head A LOT but that had diminished - and would continue to diminish over the months. My anxiety was largely there and my avoidance behaviors and compensatory behaviors and ruminating thinking was still there. I still couldn't approach any girls if you put a gun to my head. I could barely make eye contact with strangers for fear that they would be offended. The self criticism was still strong. I would still rather have died than turned to a friend or loved one and shared my problems with anxiety, or my two academic suspensions from an Ivy League school (simply could not function due to performance anxiety), or that I was a virgin who had never had a girlfriend.

But something was happening. In an ineffable sense, it got a bit quieter in my head, and then I started to loosen up here and there. I would say yes to invitations from friends (I never accepted ANY invitations from friends before), I would hold eye contact (even with girls!), smile, and even say hi to strangers. Now, full disclosure, a lot of these developments occurred because there were times when I wouldn't feel anxiety. Times, for instance, when I would look at a girl and my chest wouldn't constrict painfully and I wouldn't feel like a deer in headlights. Sans the associated physical symptoms, I behaved healthily. 

But. Nine months in, the higher hanging fruit in my anxiety totem pole - sharing intimate details with people (people, even those who barely know me, have often called me out for being closed off), conversing with my mum (especially about anxiety triggering topics), approaching girls - all of those still triggered the physical symptoms of anxiety and avoidance. I was convinced that the key to beating my anxiety was abating the overwhelming physical symptoms of anxiety which trigger avoidance. I was wrong.

To cut a long story short, over the last three months, three key events happened which helped break me completely free of anxiety. The first was having my first ever girlfriend. The second was her breaking up with me 3 days after we were together due to insecure, compensatory habits I had developed for my anxiety in the past and my ensuing deep guilt and soul searching, and the third was a meditation retreat I attended.

Today, I still feel anxiety. I still trigger avoidance when I feel the physical symptoms of anxiety. But there's a clear difference in my response. The moment I feel those physical symptoms and that avoidance, I have this ineffable intuitive sense that attending to my anxiety in a certain way only increases my suffering, I have this intuitive sense that *I have a choice* about whether to cultivate the anxiety or let it go, and I have this intuitive sense of how exactly to let it go.

Think of it like playing basketball. You shoot the ball and it goes into the basket, broadly speaking. But you have only an intuitive sense of how you're able to calculate how far the basket is, how much spin to give the ball, what arc to give the ball. Now think of what happens when a beginner plays in a basketball game when someone applies defensive pressure to them. Their brain gets scrambled because of their anxiety and they lose the ability make use of that intuitive sense. But look at a professional player. He is not oblivious to the defensive pressure. It still affects him. But he is still able to recover from the momentary mental confusion and tap back into his intuitive sense of how to direct the ball into the hoop, even though he could never tell you how he's able to do it. 

That's how it is with anxiety and me. It arises like a bubble and I experience it and something tells me that I don't have to continue paying attention to it in a certain way (what 'in a certain way' means, I will never be able to explain in words). So I direct my attention to my breath. SOMETIMES, my attention will instantly go forcefully back to the physical symptoms and my mental confusion will return and this will happen over and over again. The KEY DIFFERENCE is that whereas before I would have questioned whether I was being mindful in the correct way or if my mindfulness was working or whether I needed to tweak my technique or try something different is that I bring my attention right back to my breath, over and over again. SOMEHOW, I'm not sucked into the anxiety. I can't explain it. But it's not voluntary - AT ALL. It just sort of happens in the way the basketball player intuitively knows to fluidly change his pace and his direction at full speed to elude defensive pressure. I could never fully explain it. And that's the thing - I simultaneously have a clear intuitive understanding that if I try to consciously mess with these responses, my anxiety will only inflame and increase. I subconsciously understand exactly how much to get involved and how much to leave alone. I subconsciously understand that attending to the physical emotions of anxiety and mental confusion does something bad to my quality of attention and thinking. How all this came from simply paying attention to the physical sensations of my breath and body, I have no idea - but I really didn't do anything more special than that over the past year.

So looking back, I can safely say that none of the efforts I made to help my anxiety alone were worthwhile. But, at the same time, I'm not even sure I could have helped any of the efforts. The more I meditate, the more I see that it's a very questionable proposition to attribute any of my volitions or emotions - healthy or not - to my doing. In fact, more and more of my creativity and my performance comes from understanding how my drive to manage and exert control and intellectually master/understand only interferes with beautiful processes which are working themselves out. But if you had told me this a year ago today when I found Search Inside Yourself, I'm not sure it would have made a difference even if I had completely believed you. The brain does its own thing. :)

Ask away! I've omitted and truncated here and there because I realized this was turning into a tl'dr :)

For almost all of my life, I have dealt with a variety of anxieties. For as long as I could remember, I slept in my mom's bed with her. I couldn't explain why, I just could not face sleeping in my room alone. I hardly ever had any friends over (Back when I actually had friends) for the night, because I knew that if I ended up in my mom's bed, there would be a lot of questions. 

Even when my sister had friends over, I stayed awake until they fell asleep, so I could sneak off to my mom's room. 

Because of the small bed size, and because my younger brother also sleeps in the bed (For other complicated reasons), I rarely got a good nights sleep. 

Occasionally, I have attempted to sleep on my own, but couldn't do it. During the day, I tell myself that I want to sleep on my own. I get so close, until the night comes. Every time, I found that I couldn't do it. Something would come up, or something would scare me into crawling back to my mom's room. 

There were times when I was younger, that my little brothers father would try to force me to sleep in my own bed. He would tease me, or laugh at me. Because of this, I would lay awake in my bed until I was sure that he was asleep, so that I could creep silently in next to my mom. He often slept on the floor in the living room. 

Finally, last night, I decided that enough was enough. I will be a high school senior in just a few weeks. It was time that I grow up and face one of my fears. I hooked my ipod up to a speaker, and set in to play some of my favorite songs on a low volume. 

As lights in the house went out, I got a little bit nervous. Could I really do this? I tossed and turned for half an hour, trying to clear my fears out of my head. There were quiet a few times that I almost gave up. A big one was when I had to get out of the bed and throw the light on after finding a thumb tack stuck under the sheets. It would have been so much easier to throw the light off and run to my mom's room. But something inside knew that I could do it. 

I clicked off the light and padded back to my bed, settling in once again. It took a while, but I guess that eventually I fell asleep because the next thing I knew, my alarm was going off on my iPod. It was morning! I had finally, after so many years, slept in my bed through the night. I even turned off the alarm and slept for another hour! 

Tonight will be my second attempt, and hopefully it will stick! 

TL;DR: After 17 years of embarrassment and ridicule, I finally got through a night in my own bed alone.

It's really bad this week, where I'm getting jittery and overworked about almost everything.


I've always been bad with procrastination, but when my anxiety is flaring up I always get it **extremely** badly. As in, I've got a really important uni essay due in in a matter of hours, which I haven't done, but I just sit in front of the computer or books I'm meant to be reading, and not doing it. Every time I put my head to starting, I'll work for about two minutes, until I get worried about actually going through with the work. 


Somewhere I know I can do it, and as soon as I *start*, properly start, I can literally get it done in about 3 hours of just working. But it takes seemingly days of sitting doing absolutely nothing, not getting spurred into working.


I can't think because I'm worrying about how I can't just get it done. Then I worry that I'll do it, but it'll be terrible. My housemate keeps telling me it's my fault, and that if I just sit down I'll just do it. But I literally can't! It's bad because I am clever, and I want to do well, but being nervous about my work really doesn't help and means I end up rushing everything.

Does anyone else have this, and have any ways to get over the avoidance? ",,False,,t5_2qmij,False,,,True,t3_1468ov,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1468ov/does_anyone_else_suffer_from_anxietyrelated/,

I always worry what people think of me. I'm always quiet at work and hardly say anything of any value to anyone for fear of saying the wrong thing. I've been trying to change that lately and get over this irrational fear. I've gotten slightly more comfortable in the past few months and decided its time to up the ante.Tonight I went to a bar by myself, with no friends, no acquaintances, no crutch (not literally). I just found and empty seat at a bar and had a couple of beers. I didn't talk to anybody because I was still afraid. But at least I went god dammit.This is a small victory and a first for me. Maybe next time I'll actually work up the courage to talk to somebody and have a decent conversation. Then maybe after that I'll make some friends and even meet a nice girl who's worth my time.It was open mic night, and I just sat at the bar and enjoyed the music. I wasn't expecting anything to change my life tonight and it didn't. But at least I've taken this first step to HOPEFULLY bettering myself.Happy Valentines Day all and I hope my story helps you.Edit: Holy cow I didn't expect such a response.

Us, the worrieries, are really god damn good at worrying. This is because we have a LOT of practice with worrying.  We keep repeating the troublesome thoughts in our head, over and over.  We're rehearsing the idea, repeating it, and keep running it through our minds.

There is an opposite effect that could be happening instead.  We continue to rehearse, repeat and run it through our mind, but instead of focusing on the negatives(the worry, the fears, the problems) we focus on the ""hope"" or ""confidence"" (look at the positives of the situation, look at what you learned) then our problems will melt away. 

You just need to change the focus of your thoughts.  

We need to realize that our human worth is infinite and complete because we exist, we need to resist falling into the mindset that so many corporations want us to be in, of needing external stimuli to feel complete. 

The fact that you are alive is reason enough to celebrate, just focus on the positives of life instead of the negatives, we will enjoy our time on earth that much more.

When I'm not on the internet, I'm restless, anxious, and can't focus on anything, including conversations with people. I get extremely impatient, and even a little angry, internally, when someone engages me in small talk. The only thing that seems to help a little is drinking coffee, which doesn't really erase the anxiety, just gives me a little motivation. When I actually can make myself work on a project (such as music, drawing, cleaning, etc.), I lose attention within 30 minutes. I think it's anxiety-induced ADHD.

1375869114.0,178,self.Anxiety,1jvhb3,7 most helpful things I have learned to control anxiety.,CrayonConstantinople,194,16,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jvhb3/7_most_helpful_things_i_have_learned_to_control/,"Hi guys,

I've had anxiety since I was 17 (I'm 25 now), so about 8 years. It was very bad for 3, then died down a bit, then came back after smoking some weed in Feb.

I read a book called ""At Last A Life"" which I can honestly say has helped me understand anxiety a whole lot better than ever before.

Here are some of the crowning bits of knowledge I've learned.

1. You are NOT going mad, you are just a sensitive person with anxious thoughts. That's perfectly okay. Many people have strange or upsetting thoughts every day, however, we are so sensitive that we get worried or upset about these thoughts. It's this reaction to the thought that cause anxiety, not the thought itself, so (as hard as this can be to do), just ignore the thought. If you think of something awful happening, just say ""yeah, grand. This is just an anxious thought. Whatever"".

2. Anxiety can't be gotten rid of like a flu, but it can be managed so well that it feels like its gone. 
One of the best things I've learned is that I will always have anxiety, I am by nature of a nervous disposition. But that's okay with me. I am learning to be okay with it, I have stopped fighting it. I don't beat myself up about it and I move on each day. In essence, I am reducing my anxiety about having anxiety. 

3. Deep breaths. You can't panic and relax at the same time. You can control your breathing which in turn controls your heart rate. When you get that sinking feeling of anxiety, take 10 nice long deep breaths while repeating the following: ""I am a good, I am kind, I am okay"". This will give your mind a positive message to focus on while you slow your breathing and relax.

4. Stop trying to figure out how to control or stop anxiety. You continue to give it more power which increases its hold on you. Accept it.

5. Remember that an anxiety attack is a release of adrenaline into the body. Your mind believes there is a threat so it releases adrenaline into your system to help your caveman body deal with it. This was great when the threat was a cheetah but not so great when the threat is a thought you can't run away from. But understanding what the panic attack is allows you to relax slightly. 
So when a panic attack starts, realise that this uncomfortable sensation is just adrenaline rushing around your body, it can't hurt you. Although it is uncomfortable, nothing can happen to you. The adrenaline will stop soon and you will feel better.

6. Apparently 1 in 10 people in America have anxiety. You are not alone and you are not as isolated as you feel. You are one of many who feel this way so don't feel like you are all alone and the only one who feels like this. You are perfectly normal and this is going to get better over time. As you learn to deal with it, it gets easier and this happens with time. It won't be gone tomorrow so don't put pressure on yourself to fix it. 

7. But the book I mentioned above. It goes into great detail and is written by a guy who dealt with anxiety for 10 years before he learned how to deal with it. 

I wish you well guys. Remember that people with anxiety tend to be very nice people who get upset because of their thoughts. That just shows what a lovely bunch we are. Those horrible thoughts of you doing something bad, having something bad happen to you, bad things happening to other, worries about the world, economy, exams, etc, etc are only just thoughts. One you learn how to control your reaction to them, you will learn how to control your anxiety. Hope this has helped!

Love to all!",,False,,t5_2qmij,False,,,True,t3_1jvhb3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jvhb3/7_most_helpful_things_i_have_learned_to_control/,

They were having a discussion about a play we had read in class, specifically on a character who was debated to have some sort of mental illness. This then turned into a discussion solely on mental illness and mental disorders, and how the western world has exploited the term and uses it as a copout to being a contributing member of society. They then decided to just go out and say it: ""Anxiety and depression are both first world problems, and people just seriously need to get over it. They aren't real ailments, so get the hell over yourself.""
Now, they all very well know I struggle with anxiety. They also knew I was in the room. I said nothing throughout the whole discussion, but 10 minutes later, I walked out of the house without saying a word.

Now, I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty sick and tired of people who have no idea what its like to live with a mental disorder judging others who live with them every single day. NO ONE who struggles with these disorders wants them, so what gives you the right to tell someone to 'get over it'? No. Not okay, and it will never be okay. I struggle with chronic GAD, and have been for a few years, and  none of them know the true extent of how much my anxiety has crippled my ability to preform in school. Its changed my personality, and has recently drawn me away from social situations. There isn't an immediate solution to 'fixing' a disorder that consumes you so fully. It can be so overwhelming, and these people don't get how hard it can be to live with it.

People all over the world deal with anxiety, and although it is proven that western countries have more treated cases, it doesn't give you a right to slap such a negative label on it. its a serious problem in a lot of lives, and needs to be treated delicately, just like you would any ailment.

Nobody wants anxiety, so to those of you who think we do this for attention, you can fuck off.

I'm gonna go cry into my pillow now.

Edit: Wow, I seriously wasn't expecting this many people to reply! Thank you all for your support, advice and words of wisdom. Unfortunately, I know these people will never truly understand where I am coming from, but I now know that there are many of you who get what I'm saying and live with the same disorder I do. I will continue pushing to get better, continue my therapy and medication, and try to focus more of my energy on those who actually care about my wellbeing. Again, gratitude to every single one of you who has sent kindness my way. Namaste.

I want other people to know there's hope for RECOVERY not just MANAGEMENT.,moncamonca,195,32,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1i71t1/i_have_all_but_cured_my_anxiety_i_want_other/,"I'm 25, have had panic attacks and social anxiety since I was 16, when my friend committed suicide. I thought this was just the way my life would always be. My panic attacks, PTSD, social anxiety, and impending doom started getting worse this year; I was increasingly convinced I was going to die, or at least throw up or piss my pants in public. I had severe anxiety whenever I had to talk to anyone, and moderate anxiety just waking up in the morning, which could escalate to panic without warning. It felt like the world was ending. I thought I was going completely insane and considered dropping out of my grad school program and getting inpatient psychiatric treatment. But that didn't happen. Instead, here's what worked for me:

1. **Therapy.** It was awkward and stressful and terrifying at first. Trust me, I had been avoiding it for so long. But I finally went, and kept going. It is seriously hard work, but when you are ready to put in the effort to be vulnerable and better understand yourself, it can be a transformative experience. I went once a week for 6 months, then twice a week for 3 months, and will continue once a week for however long I need to.

2. **Acupuncture.** I know it might sound fancy or expensive, but if you go to a community acupuncture clinic, each appointment costs $15, which is MORE than worth it if you have disabling anxiety. Plus you get to stay as long as you want. It helped me so much, especially at the beginning when my body was in a constant state of hyperarousal and tension; acupuncture was the only thing that could seriously relax me. [Check to see if you have a community acupuncture clinic close to you.](https://www.pocacoop.com/clinics/) I went twice a week for a month, then once a week for two months, now whenever I feel particularly stressed or feel like I want to indulge in deep relaxation.

3. **Finding something spiritual to ground me.** I'm not going to go into my beliefs, but it was something I was neglecting entirely. Once I had a renewed sense of spiritual presence, my anxiety (though persistent) didn't have as much terrifying weight, because I had more perspective on my existence as a whole. I don't care if it's yoga, stargazing, Buddha, Allah, Jesus Christ, mindfulness, running marathons, or bird watching, but find something that makes you feel connected to living life in a deep, meaningful way. It made my anxiety less important, though of course not any less real.

4. **Being patient with myself.** I never expected myself to get better quickly. It has been 9 months of busting my ass to get to where I am. I've had to allow myself to just accept wherever I am in the process, including being frustrated and exhausted and scared and all that. This might be the most difficult part, especially for little old perfectionist me.

5. **Taking care of myself physically.** I eat whole, delicious foods that make me happy and only drink water and herbal tea. I get about 8 hours of sleep a night. Being consistently physically active (walking, biking, practicing yoga) definitely relieves some anxiety too, but I think it's most effective when done in tandem with other treatments (evidence suggests this, too).

6. **Watching these videos from the [Mindweather101: Navigating Mental and Emotional Distress](http://www.alloflife.org/Our-Classes/) ""class"".** The course is just a series of videos that you can watch whenever you feel like it (and it's free). One of the main ideas is that our brains are always changing. Thus even those of us diagnosed with a ""mental illness"" have brains with the capacity to change. Unfortunately, few mental health practitioners practice with this philosophy, even though there is tons of evidence on neuroplasticity. The class is about working with the attitude that you can recover fully from the mental health issues you are struggling with (like anxiety, but they tend to talk more about severe depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia).

I know that everyone's experience with anxiety is different, but I just wanted to share with you all to celebrate how far I've come and to encourage others to reconceptualize their anxiety as something they can grow past rather than something you always have to suffer with. Thinking about my anxiety with this hope and insight has helped me grow so much without using any pharmacotherapeutic medication. My therapist offered prescription antianxiolytics but I declined and said I would like to try without first. Sure, there have been many times where I wished I had a benzo in my bag to pop in my mouth when my social anxiety seemed unbearable, but I survived without and with a lot of hard work I no longer have that need. I am not saying this intending to make people feel bad for using medications, but I want people to know that *you CAN recover to a point that you no longer need meds*. Getting on meds does not mean you have to depend on them forever. No single treatment could have led me to where I am now, but with therapy, acupuncture, healthy spiritual and physical practices, that Mindweather course, and a lot of patience, I am panic attack free and have hardly any social anxiety. I feel less anxious and more joyful than I have in my entire life.

God, I feel so stupid.  

I posted some pages of my journal/comic in /r/pics.  I scanned the rules, and I guess I misinterpreted what was meant.  In retrospect, I guess it's pretty clear.

[This happened.](http://i.imgur.com/iu21n71.png)

And I just—I lost it.  Full-blown, hyperventilating, crying, shaking, sobbing, nauseous, dizzy, everything.  It's not about screwing up and posting something that isn't meant to be there (that's bad enough), but—

I've never had anyone be so intentionally cruel to me.  And I lived through middle school!  

Why, having been given the information that someone has panic disorder—struggles with it every day—why, *why* would you intentionally try to trigger them?

""Panic about the goddamned rules.""

*Fuck you, fuck your struggle, fuck the fact that you were trying to reach out to others.  Fuck good intentions, fuck your medical condition, fuck everything about you.  You posted a picture on the internet that I don't like, so I hope you have a goddamned fucking panic attack.*

Someone was mean to me on the internet.  

It's a dumb reason to be sad, to have your feelings hurt.  It's a really goddamned fucking *stupid* reason to have a panic attack.

Man, I'm so sad right now.

So i am planning a app (Multi-platform. Android first out) That will help me with just this. I know there are similiar apps on the market today, but i feel that they are either badly designed, badly coded, or miss some features. 

If i am going to make this app, i would love to get some encouragement from you people, and maybe some comments on how you would like such an app to be, if you would be to use it yourself.

The app would be donationware. (Free and no ads except an one-time notification about the possibility to donate.)

These are the things that you will learn through therapy.  The things that your brain thinks are so horrible that they must be hidden from you at all costs.

First, I should say that my anxiety is partly learned.  My mom had such a horrifying childhood that she pretty much faced every day as possibly her last if she didn't look out.  I learned that behavior from her.

As a result of her childhood experience, it wasn't possible for my mom to love me, and it was also possible that she might have killed me if I didn't watch *myself*.  This is what my brain didn't want me to know.  She had several episodes while I was growing up when she lost touch with reality.  At those times, she could have done anything.

Likewise, my father was an abusive and extremely narcissistic person.  He's not really able to care for anyone but himself and he's not going to realize that in this lifetime.

Together, my parents made for a hellish homelife.  But what did my brain tell me?  It told me that I had the best parents ever!

It amazes me how few words it takes to tell the tale, but how long it took to get this into my consciousness.  Until I understood this, it affected every single relationship that I had.  Apparently, my brain thought it would be a good idea to seek out people who had the same traits that my parents had so that I could *try again* and make it work out right this time.

It took me too many years to get into therapy and start to straighten all of this out.  Looking at what I just wrote, it is terrible and sad, but it still somehow isn't as bad as my brain made me think it would be.  I'm glad I went through the therapy and started to gain control of my life.  I only wish that I had started sooner.",,False,,t5_2qmij,False,,,True,t3_1da8ul,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1da8ul/the_horrible_things_i_learned_in_therapy_that/,

She said that while she was driving through she had two panic attacks. 

I suppose it's possible she did indeed have two panic attacks. However, I only recall having three or four in my anxiety-ridden life (24 years old), one of which was particularly horrific, involving serious hyperventilation which led to a loss of control in my hands and facial muscles (they sort of crumpled up). The others were less severe, but still had me breathing fast and deep with an overwhelming sense of desperation. 

So, when I hear people just toss out the phrase ""panic attack"", I'm a little...annoyed. Anyone else experience this?

Edit: Alright people, I'm big enough to admit that belittling my friend's experience was not the best way to handle my frustration and that there are probably some feelings that came before my annoyance that I should take some time to sit with. Got it.

They happen to everybody, often.
They can happen for random little reasons, or they can happen because of specific actions.
Either way, they are almost never symptoms of major diseases or afflictions.

*A skipped heart beat every few seconds is something to worry about. One is not.
A little chest discomfort is probably a stretched muscle or heartburn.
If you lean on your arm, it will become numb. It's not a heart attach.
Your face, when focused upon, will feel tingly and twitchy - it happens.
Headaches happen, they aren't prophets of strokes or brain cancer.
Heart attackes show wildly varying but almost always strong symptoms.
Focusing on one side of your body will make it feel different, feeding into paranoia.

*Our bodies have been through a lot, we have crossed nerves and damaged tissues that tingle or twitch or cramp or get numb sometimes. Strange or odd sensations will happen to everybody older than 2.

*You're getting older, but you're not getting unhealthy. Health is relative.

*Go for a walk or go swimming or something. Clear your head.
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine isn't a mantra, it's the truth. Believe yourself.

*When you worry about your body, your scope of attention will focus down to the tiniest nerve bundles. We're constantly recieving a stream of sensation from every nerve, but we drown them out. When you start focusing on a part of your body, your attention zooms in and you start to feel things you don't remember feeling five minutes ago, making you think it's getting worse. Remember that.

*You're not being a wimp, you're not crazy. Just affected by modern health-watching.
Our bodies are strong enough to resist viruses, bacteria, temperatures, starvation, dehydration, poisoning, overmineralization, falls, cuts, bruises, traumatic events, and more. We're stronger than you think. 

*How many times a year do you think people just drop dead because of sudden and oncoming afflictions? A huge amount. Millions. It's the truth - it happens. You know how many people there are? Just by sheer odds, not to mention that your lifestyle is significantly more healthy than most other human beings on this planet, your chance of getting a stroke or cancer or a heart attack in the next couple years is probably incredibly low. Don't believe me? Start living a healthier lifestyle. Your odds go way down the better you live anyways, so you have no reason to worry. Just live.

*The anxiety is not rational fear. We are rational beings and have to act like it.
I know it's hard to pretend you aren't feeling afraid for your life at the hint of something wrong, but it doesn't hurt to pretend, even just to yourself. Maybe you doubt it will work, but eventually a little positive reinforcement like ""for God's sake, I'm fine"" to yourself here and there might do some good.

I got a lot of responses to starting this anxiety support group, so I thought I would make a more solidified post about it.


The project is called “Just Breathe”. Basically, this will be a list of people who all have some form of anxiety or panic. You can sort of think of them (as well as yourself) like a “sponsor”.  We are here to contact one another in times of need.  I know we can't always talk to our friends and family because they can only sympathize with us, but not really empathize.


What I believe to be special about this anxiety group is that we created an “anxiety bio”. The bio will allow you to talk to someone who actually can RELATE to you because they have the similar fears and triggers. Remember, no anxiety is too small or too big. Whether you have anxiety over bugs, flying, social interaction, etc. It is all legitimate and never stupid or silly. 

Even if you do not feel comfortable being contacted, you can still be a part of it! You will be put in the group with no contact info available. You may contact other members of the group if you need support. You can also decide at any time if you would like to make your info available for others. You may also be removed from the list at any time. 

You have the option to be anonymous. You may just use your Reddit username as your contact info, instead of an email address. You can be removed from the list at whenever you would like. Just ask. 


Your information will be stored as a DropBox document. The only people who have access to this list, are the people who have been invited to view it via email or given a specific link. The document will be updated whenever a new members would like to join or whenever someone would like to opt out.


The more people involved the better, the more support there will be!
If you would like to be part of the group, please message me on Reddit or email me at justbreathereddit@gmail.com. I will need the following information from you:

1. Name you would like to go by.
2. Geographic location.
3. How you would like to be contacted. Note if you do not want to be contacted by anyone. 
4. Anxiety bio. (just a little info about yourself and your anxiety)

You are a liar.  Did you know that?  There is a part of your brain that is a compulsive, pathological, incessant, unstoppable liar.  Every day, from the moment you wake until you pass out with your heart racing and feet rubbing together, a voice in your head is lying to you.  

And the worst part about is that every day, from the moment you wake until you pass out, you fucking listen to that voice!  Here is what's going on: 

Long ago humans evolved the ability to think on an incredible level.  But this new brain did not replace the old one; instead, it grew on top of it.  We still have many, probably close to all, of the primitive functions that even simple animals have.  You eat, shit, fuck, and fear not much unlike a goddamn squirrel.  

You have inside your brain a primitive emotional system designed to provide short-term motivation to do things necessary to keep you alive or to reproduce.  Fear exists because it helps keep life living: something that's afraid will drop everything and run the fuck away, or fight to the death, better than something that's not, as a general principle. 

The problem with you and me is that our primitive emotional system is entangled with our advanced upper-brain.  It's not just the angry bear standing in front of you that causes anxiety, it's the *thought* of an angry bear that causes an identical reaction in you.  

Let me repeat that last point:  your thoughts can cause you anxiety to the same degree as if you were actually experiencing a dangerous event.  People who have panic attacks know this all too well - there could be literally nothing dangerous in front of them in the real world, but their mind will react to a thought - a goddamn fairy tale in their mind - as if they were facing actual danger. 

I think most people have a thought-system that creates and fires off negative thoughts by the dozens each day.  Some people aren't really aware of their negative thoughts until they really focus on them, though, because they can happen really, really fast and can be going on behind the scenes without the type of focus you usually picture when you think about your ""thoughts.""  These aren't thoughts like the thoughts you have when you're trying to solve a math problem.  These are thoughts like fireworks popping off at any moment in your mind, almost from nowhere, but sometimes so feint you can only react to it without being aware that it even happened. 

What happened beginning in the 1950s with Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck is a new approach to therapy for people with anxiety disorders.  It's goal is to defeat your reaction to the negative thoughts that act like little angry bears in your mind - you learn that the thoughts are just thoughts, and they usually have little or nothing to do with reality.  This is the basis of **cognitive behavioral therapy**, which I did for years and am cured of my generalized anxiety disorder.  I still have anxiety, as does anyone who breathes, but it doesn't even come close to the shit I suffered for 10-15 years before finding a great CBT therapist and reading about it. 

Similarly, **mindfulness** and **mindfulness based cognitive therapy** teach you to ignore, in a way, your thoughts.  Yes, this can be done.  The way I think of it is like this:  imagine you are standing in front of a girl naked, and she is laughing and making fun of you.  And this goes on for hours.  How long until you just don't give a fuck any more?  How long until you realize that her laughter doesn't mean shit to you?  

How long until you realize that the voice in your head telling you that you will fail, or you will make a fool out of yourself, or people hate you, or that a girl will reject you, or that you're going to get fired, or that you're going to have a panic attack outside and then the whole world will laugh at you, or that you just can't meet your boss' expectations, etc., are just words.  Worthless, meaningless, stupid words. 

The next time you're anxious about something, don't run from the thoughts.  Invite them in.  Let them flow.  Relax your stomach and jaw.  Don't try to breathe more slowly, go with it.  And let the thoughts flow by without reacting to them.  Because it's your thoughts, and not the world out there, that makes you anxious.  

The cure for anxiety is to cure the way you react to your thoughts.  

**EDIT 1**:   Reading some of the comments saddens me.  This forum is rife with recommendations and discussions of medications and anecdotal stories about what people have said about what people think is happening to them when they have anxiety.  Very, very, very few discussions of successful therapies, links to scientific reports and research, and discussions of therapists.  The reason people don't get better is because what they think is wrong.  Dead wrong.  Stop listening to me and others and GO READ THE GODDAMN RESEARCH.  

People who think that the modality is not as important a good therapist of some ineffective modality are dead wrong, and the research proves it.  And it's not mindfulness, it's mindfulness based CBT.  Mindfulness is different.  

People who think that anxiety just happens out of the blue are dead wrong, except for those extremely limited situations where someone has a medical issue or drug issue.  Anxiety has thought-based causes, and if you've never dealt with the thoughts, then you aren't aware of them.  Dealing with the thoughts does not mean stopping them, shutting them off, or stifling them, it means understanding them and their relationship to actual reality. 

I'm sorry, but anyone who wants to get better needs to look into successful treatment and stop bullshitting around this forum with discussions of medication.  Go to a psychiatrist for medication.

I've been seeing a therapist, have had many reassuring conversations with friends and former colleagues that I could not have done anything differently, but I feel so bad all the time, like I am living with a great burden.

He gave me .5 MG dosage and recommended that I cut them in half if needed. I am very aware of the habit forming tendencies of Xanex so I am very careful with it.

It leaves me paralyzed - better to do nothing than to try and fail. 

Someone left the following comment on my blog and it's been tremendously helpful, so I thought I'd share - 

""Imagine two different scenarios of yourself 10 years from now. One scenario in which you accepted your mistakes (everyone makes them!), forgave yourself (you didn’t murder anyone, you just were a little bit lost, so what!), and moved on and accomplished so much. In the other scenario, you never fully put the past behind you, you struggled with feelings of regret and shame, which caused unnecessary anxiety and made you just coast another 10 years and barely get by or worse.

So, keep envisioning your successful future self coming back in time, walking alongside you, encouraging you, and telling you to “relax, don’t get so worried, just get excited and passionate about your goals and have fun working hard towards them! Look where it got us!”

But she could only take so much. After a few months of my anxiety getting worse she couldn't take it and she said she wasn't sure she wanted to be with me anymore. It was only then that I decided something was TOO wrong with me and I had to do something about it.

After talking back and forth a bit, I just ""Whatever, just have a good life"" and hung up. 

I started crying because I was upset and I was shaking from just standing up for myself. It was the first time I had ever done that.

EDIT:  Thank you so much everyone for replying.  I didn't expect such a response.  I feel the need to explain what brought me to the thoughts above.  I have agoraphobia and panic disorder, and was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2.  I counted it up today and realized that I had my first symptoms over 30 years ago, and that in the pat 10 years it's gotten worse, very quickly.  I've been on many, many medications and am on 3 right now.  Nothing seems to have helped as far as medications go, so I am trying to find a Skype psychologist.  I think I need more than just popping pills.  I was once a musician and performed before many people.  Now I'm nowhere near that.  But it's people like you all that remind me that it could be possible to get back to that place.

Instead of hijacking that poster's thread, here's a description of what agoraphobia is, from someone housebound for 5.5 years.",panicmonkey,90,10,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/124scq/a_recent_agoraphobia_thread_has_shown_me_theres_a/,"Before I start, please read http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/123uma/i_havent_left_the_house_in_four_years_im_19/ and give the person some support.  They really need it.  My post is all about information.  That person could use some support first.

5.5 years housebound.  7.5 years with agoraphobia.  Wait, what?  That's one of the more puzzling things about agoraphobia.  You don't have to be housebound to have it.  Below are some other bits of information that might help people understand what it all means.

From the DSM-IV:
http://www.medicalcriteria.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47%3Apsyagoraphobia&amp;catid=76%3Apsychiatry&amp;Itemid=80&amp;lang=en

1.  Agoraphobia isn't ""fear of open places"", as is often believed.  Agoraphobia is about avoidance of places and situations.  And like potato chips, if you start avoiding one place or situation, you can't just have one, it usually spreads to other places or situations.

2.  Agoraphobics aren't always housebound.  Much of the time they are.  Before I became housebound, I was agoraphobic.  I only had to take one street to get to work, and I was unable to leave that street.  My commute was a few miles.  I avoided going anywhere off of that street.  Thats agoraphobia without being housebound.

3.  Many agoraphobics have a ""comfort radius"".  I can drive or walk about a half mile from home.  On good days, when the meds are working fine and I'm feeling adventurous, I'll go outside that zone.

4.  Not all agoraphobics have panic disorder.  There is a distinct diagnosis in the DSM-IV for agoraphobics without panic disorder.

5.  Sometimes other conditions are mistaken to be agoraphobia.  Social phobia is one - it has its own diagnostic criteria.  The results are the same, withdrawing from society and becoming more isolated, but using my story about my commute to work, I could have gotten off that one street if it was social phobia most likely.

6.  Probably the most important thing about being agoraphobic is that agoraphobic patients wind up not fearing the thing that made them agoraphobic.  They fear the resulting panic attack.  For instance, I fear driving far from home.  Not because I'm afraid of driving.  In fact, I enjoy driving very much.  I fear the panic attacks that result from driving.  This is the case with most people with the disorder.

7.  People with agoraphobia are liars.  This is extremely difficult, at least for me, because I don't want to be.  I'm an honest person by nature, but making excuses for not going and doing things has made me a liar.  In more recent years, I've decided to just tell people what I have.  It makes me feel better to maintain my integrity.  But the point still stands.  We make excuses better than most anyone you know.  And can generally manipulate any person or situation to gain equilibrium.

8.  Agoraphobia is extremely isolating.  That isolation leads to rumination, which leads to exacerbation of the symptoms, and in many cases, severe depression.  It's hard to be alone for so much o the day.  And it's humiliating to ask someone to do something for you that you should be able to do yourself.  It may sound like a lot of fun to be able to stay home and work, mess around, watch TV or whatever.  But the truth is, most of us are spending a lot of time thinking about what our lives have become and how we can make it better.  And that takes the fun out of lots of stuff.

Everything to me is so indescribably complex that I feel I have a responsibility as a human being to try to understand as much of this system as possible. While life is an experience I am grateful to have, it is causing me a great deal of anxiety. Basically what's been happening lately is I've been imagining Earth as an organic spaceship hurtling through space. Then I realize that I am a part of earth and by extension, the universe itself. These thoughts lead me to recognize the now cliche idea that I come from stardust, ""I"" am just otherwise unconscious atoms arranged in a particular order, the boundary between myself and everything else is an illusion, time as we know it is a human construct, and that I don't really exist. It's at this point where I kind of forget how to do things that should be automatic such as breathe, swallow, or walk and suddenly become aware of all my bodily processes that I do not control (kinda like that old 4chan copypasta). As you can probably imagine, these thoughts and sensations are amplified when smoking certain strains of cannabis. 

Isn't it strange how the only thing I've ever really been familiar with (myself, this world, this body) is causing me so much anxiety? Yet at the same time I am grateful to have these thoughts and question reality, which unfortunately is not the case for many people. I'm grateful to feel this obvious connection to the universe even though it gets scary at times. Now that you've gotten a glimpse at my perspective on things you can probably imagine that I have a bit of trouble functioning in society. I find it hard to convince myself to go to work to sell people expensive shit they don't need so I can buy expensive shit I don't need. I'm unsettled by the fact that I'm trading hours of my life for money. Sure, I could easily say ""fuck it"" and quit my job, go join a commune, and live off the grid, but I have become too accustomed to modern comforts. I want too much and I enjoy material goods (like my $600 phone that I'm typing this on) but I realize what I have and what I want are completely worthless in the long run. My friend who is really into meditation has told me that my wants are too small, which I agree with wholeheartedly.  

I think that life is too beautiful and too strange to waste time on pursuing capital. But what do I know? I am just another directionless 18 year old asking unanswerable questions while attempting to function in a sick society. I hope others are out there who have had a similar perspective on life that are willing to offer some guidance.

My husband called 911 and when they loaded me in to the ambulance I burst out and took off running. They were able to catch me and get me to the hospital. When my mom showed up I told her everything that I haven't been able to tell her. I told her about my anxiety, my OCD, my panic disorder and my anorexia. I don't remember any of this. All I remember is watching the movie. I feel like shit because although I have no memories of what happened my husband still does.

This should be standard procedure!"" type emails. Now every time I get an email, I'm filled with a sense of dread that it's one of my employers, getting on to me about something I screwed up. If they turn such a stupid thing into such a huge deal, I'm terrified of what will happen if I do something seriously wrong (and I already have screwed up several times). A lot of the people in my office tend to be very rude and unsympathetic as well. My boss is a living stereotype: a very materialistic, sharp-tempered, merciless, go-for-the-throat type attorney. Frankly, I’m terrified of her. She sees me as a bumbling idiot (perhaps justifiably), and has no problem showing it. I'm trying to see the humor in the situation (because after all, it is very ridiculous), but I'm too high-strung and paranoid. I’m doing very menial work in a fairly toxic environment, so I don’t intend to stay with this job too long. However, I don’t want to be perceived as a quitter, and some part of me feels like maybe I’m just being entitled, and I should just suck it up. I am young and have relatively little work experience, so maybe this is how I have to pay my dues to enter the working world. 

But in general, I'm just very timid and insecure. I think part of it comes from a deep sense of self-doubt. I don't feel like I'm worthy enough for people to give me money for my services. Therefore, I'm incredibly paranoid about proving my worthlessness by screwing something up. I did very well in school, and rarely ever had these feelings of doubt, but now it’s a totally different ball game. I’m stuck in a rut where I feel guilty that I’m not contributing anything valuable, so I try to overcompensate by being extremely cautious and meticulous, which stresses me out and makes me more prone to screwing up. I’ve seen my coworkers make mistakes and bounce back, completely unshaken. How do they do that?? Whenever I make a mistake a want to curl up in a ball and cry about my incompetence. I’ve been working there about a month, and there’s still so much I don’t know. I can’t imagine how people go to work confident each day, knowing that they can handle anything that comes up. I am so far from feeling confident in this job, and I’d love to hear how other people with anxiety deal with stressful work situations. Thanks for your help! 

TLDR; My job sucks, and I’m very insecure about my performance. How do people gain confidence in their jobs?

before going any further please note that this will contain spoilers from the new Iron man film.

So anyone who has seen it will know that during the course of the film Tony Stark has about 3 panic attacks during the film. 

The first he burst from a cafe into the suit and scans for physical problems which none are found. 

The second when a kid asks about the trauma from the avengers film and he needs to escape.

The third while driving.

Now first of I have to say this brilliant. Why?? Because it really shows an understanding of what anxiety is. The fact that the character is suffering from this after as serious life changing event is something that does happen in real life. 

While we have not strapped on a super suit and battled aliens, we have, all of us suffered some trauma that has lead our minds down this path.

I guess what I m trying to say is that I am delighted that 
1: Anxiety/Panic is shown to millions as something through cinema
2: It is portrayed very well in terms that it happens multiple times and not something our hero ""just mans up too""
3: Prompted my nephew to turn to me and ask, ""What's anxiety"" showing that its getting the word out there in the hope of normalising it to the general public as something real and life changing.

Just my two cents!

 What do you think???

I was bullied and my parents put very high demands on me to do well so that wouldn't have helped. When I was about 16 I became depressed and eventually overcame it, by overcoming my anxiety.

A lot of people reading this probably have more severe anxiety, I was pretty typical GAD sufferer:

- I feared social interaction. I remember my heart used to race just from talking in online games let alone real life.

- I feared being around people. I couldn't cough in crowded rooms, use public restrooms, make eye contact and during the bad times my legs would buckle while walking if I knew people where watching me, so sometimes I would get stuck.

- Never danced or sung in my life or even tried. Stays completely still during rock concerts.

- Failed almost every oral presentation due to not doing it.

- No sports, no girlfriends, only a few really really nice understanding friends.

- Finally, fear of failure so strong you don't try leading you to fail at life bringing on depression. Lose job, fail out of uni, family asks you to move out etc.

I overcame most of these by joining a martial art, I don't know how else to say it really, I was forced to go to a martial art dojo. The first few times I was absolutely shitting myself as I had to move! and sometime they made noises! but I was lucky in that I was forced to go. After about a month I did my first grading and was once again shitting myself as everyone was watching me but I had this weird sense of confidence, knowing I had the full support of my peers and many hours of training, I knew I could do it and I did!

Fast forward 12 months and I have so much more confidence in myself. My posture is better, I'm more fit, I'm more friendly, I'm better at talking to people, I stopped playing video games and watching TV, I went on a few dates (which again where a huge challenge).

I'm still about 100 000 miles from where I want to be, but I don't fear the dark any more. Everybody is different but maybe seeing a factual case of someone actually becoming less anxious will give you hope that it can happen.

These days I'm probably only as nervous as a normal person, public speaking, talking to pretty girls and dancing are probably my biggest fears still, but I feel completely liberated, I'm free from my own mind and I plan to be the least anxious mother fucker in the universe.

1. Play an instrument as a way to express yourself through sound.
2. Listen to music that fits your mood (see how to use music to manage your emotions).

3. Paint or draw as a way to express yourself through pictures (see creativity and happiness).

4. Create a personal diary, journal, or blog to keep track of your thoughts, feelings, and experiences (see the power of writing).

5. Dance as a fun way to exercise and release built up negative emotions and stress.

6. Go to the gym or workout (see the connection between physical and mental health).

7. Go some place where you can yell at the top of your lungs (sometimes it can be a helpful release of built up tension).

8. Watch a movie that echoes how you feel and provides a happy or inspirational ending.

9. Do yoga, tai chi, or some other mind-body exercise to release the physical stress behind your emotions.

10. Speak your thoughts and feelings to someone who is willing to listen.

11. Write a short story that focuses on similar thoughts and emotions to what you are experiencing.

12. Donate to a cause that you really believe in.

13. Ask yourself, “What are my emotions trying to tell me?” Often there is a thought process behind what we feel that we can learn from.

14. Learn how to reframe a negative situation in a more positive or productive light (see quick tips for reframing your perspective).

15. Do something kind for someone. Often creating pleasant feelings for others increases our own well-being (get started with one of these 30 acts of kindness).

16. Go out to your local park or a nature preserve. Nature can often help us get outside of our minds and appreciate the world around us more.

17. Photography, find a good place to take pictures. Then look through your set and find 1 or 2 photos that really speak to your current emotions.

18. Go for a drive with no particular destination in mind.

19. Lift weights or hit a punching bag to release stress.

20. Play a stimulating video game.

21. View anxiety or stress as motivators to act, not things that inhibit you (see the hidden power of anxiety).

22. Write a poem or song lyrics about what’s on your mind.

23. Practice a self-love meditation (see improve feelings of self-love in 5 minutes).

24. Try to solve a puzzle. It’ll help occupy your mind with something else, rather than just ruminating over the same problems (see challenge your brain – and other ways to maintain cognitive fitness).

25. Go outside for a light walk to help clear your mind.

26. Reflect on negative experiences and see what you can learn from them (read more at reflection improves learning).

27. Meditate on your thoughts and emotions without being judgmental. Don’t label them as “good” or “bad” – just accept them for what they are.

28. Channel your emotions into a competitive sport, like basketball or football.

29. Consider star gazing as an opportunity to stop and reflect on the bigger things in life (try the sky gazing meditation).

30. Respectfully confront someone who may be responsible for how you feel.

31. Engage in a simple pleasure to remind yourself of the finer things in life (such as a dessert or your favorite TV show).

32. Learn how to take criticism constructively, rather than letting it just get you sad or frustrated (see how to take criticism like a champ).

33. If a negative emotion is motivating you to do something destructive, try doing the exact opposite of what you feel.

34. Read a novel that temporarily takes you into a new world.

35. Join a forum or online support group that shares similar troubles.

36. Use negative relationships in the past as a resource to improve relationships in the future.

37. When reflecting on negative events in your life, try to see how they may have made you a better person. Often these experiences can build resilience in the long-term (psychologist refer to this as post-traumatic growth).

38. Channel your anger or other “high charged” emotions to drive you to be more productive.

39. Make tedious work more fun to help manage boredom or apathy (see blur the line between work and play).

40. Use stress or fatigue as a sign to take a break or enjoy some leisure time (see 50 stress relievers that take 5 minutes or less).

41. Wake up early and watch the sunrise. Learn to appreciate every new day as a clean slate.

42. Label your fears when you experience them and they become easier to face (see labeling negative emotions can help you overcome them).

43. Surround yourself with positive and supporting friends and family who can quickly turn your mood around.

44. Use your emotional energy to create positive affirmations that motivate you to grow and improve (see 75 affirmations for self improvement).

45. Find something to be grateful (see be grateful for your senses).

46. Channel your emotions and write your own daily prayer to help motivate and inspire yourself (see write your own daily prayer).

47. Think about role models in your life who may have overcome similar obstacles (see how we find motivation in other people’s struggles).

48. Use your energy to clean, organize, or redecorate your home or office space.

49. Read some inspirational quotes (see quotes I’ve collected).

A few years ago I started having some problems with anxiety.  Things have improved slowly but steadily until now, at which point I would probably rate my anxiety as ""low"" rather than where it started as ""crushing"".

Here's something which has helped in my recovery.

I have found that it's useful to distinguish physical sensation from my emotional state.  The best example I've come up with is the feeling you get when you drink coffee.

Originally when all of this started, I quit drinking coffee, because whenever I drank coffee I would feel anxious.  I've realized over time that it wasn't really the coffee which was causing me to become anxious.  Caffeine creates the physical sensation in my body of a slightly tightened chest, a fluttering in my stomach, enhanced mental acuity, and a slightly modified mental perception of what's going on.

These physical sensations are very similar to those I feel when I am in an anxious state of mind, and so originally whenever I felt these sensations my mind would interpret them as feelings which required an anxiety response and would lead to an anxious state of mind, which would sometimes lead to panic attacks.  Now, when I drink coffee and feel these things I simply make myself mindful that these physical sensations DO NOT require an emotional response.  They're simply caused by the effect of a drug on my body, and the drugs effect of increased synaptic activity in my thinkputty.

Immediately, my anxiety response disappears and I can enjoy the caffeine buzz as I used to before all of this business started.

Every cup of coffee is a therapy session, and it has helped me make my way back to some level of normalcy.  

I started with a quarter cup of coffee per day and slowly worked my way up.  Now I drink about a cup a day, which is generally all I want anyway.

1364476530.0,69,self.Anxiety,1b6azf,Just turned 26 and the biggest cause of my anxiety is the uncertainty of growing up.  Some reflections I wrote on my second adolescence. ,iced327,75,6,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1b6azf/just_turned_26_and_the_biggest_cause_of_my/,"Someone once dropped the phrase ""wrong side of 25"" in a conversation I was having about relationships and age gaps. Details of the discussion aside, the implication was obvious; the difference between your early 20s and late 20s is significant, much like the difference between your early and late teens.

I spent most of 2012 on neither side of 25 - rather right in the middle, an experience that only served to cement the meaning of the phrase for me.

I imagine I'm not the only person beginning to realize that adulthood isn't really a threshold you instantly cross once you get a degree and a job. That omniscient quality that our elders once seemed to possess was really nothing more than a facade, as if they were trying to guide us in the right direction only to reassure themselves through our successes that they themselves had found all the answers. The wisdom we gain with age isn't a sudden culmination of their efforts, but it’s the result of our own trial and error with our friends, our coworkers, and the other relationships we foster in the “real world”. And one day we might seek to validate it by passing it on to someone else.

I spent the last year teetering on the edge of a second adolescence. Part of me kept holding on to my college years, a time when consequences were trivial and mistakes could be laughed off. The other part believed that I had finally figured myself out and that the decisions I made were the manifestation of my newfound status as a “real person” or an “adult” or whatever ambiguous term I held up to the mirror that morning. But at the end of it all, I found myself unable to identify with either person. Someone said to me this year, “I liked you better when I thought you had it all figured out.” So did I.

It was equally as hard to find myself in reflections of my friends, as so many people in my generation are either reliving their college years in the city, married and settled in the suburbs, or struggling just as much as me to find their place in a world that was as unprepared for them as they were for it. We’ve all been standing on our own two feet for some time now, but there’s rarely a hint of stability or uniformity in our gait. We can at least find comfort in knowing that we’re not alone in our confusion.

It’s hard to tell if next year I’ll find myself on the “right side of 25”. I made a lot of mistakes this year, but no more than I did over the last five years. To think I’ll suddenly figure it all out and become an adult over the following months would only further the same misconception I’ve been following thus far.

I took a big step this morning in addressing uncertainties about myself that I’ve yet left unanswered, and I hope not to have to follow through on it alone. I’m still struggling to find any indication that I’m not merely a teenager who knows how to behave in public, but I doubt it will come from a single event or epiphany. I may be an adult in terms of my age and the responsibilities handed to me, but those aren’t metrics by which I choose to judge myself.

I’m an adult because I’m told to be. I’m an adolescent because I feel like one. And I’m a child because I learn like one.

There is no single definition or identity to which I can relate. Our 20s are a journey and our personalities are malleable. Our experiences may be different, but our questions are the same. What matters through this journey is that we foster the relationships and opportunities that allow us to bring ourselves to the table and learn from what we see. I’m fortunate to have the friends that have been with me for so much of my life, and I’m fortunate to be able to define myself by my own terms.

If one day you wake up and suddenly realize that you have all the answers, let me know. I promise I’ll take good notes.

What I changed:
1. Started taking multi-vitamins, inositol, and theanine. 
2. Exercising every day; mostly lifting weights.
3. Changed my diet. This means more fruits/ vegetables/ whole grains. Also, I drink green tea and chamomile tea. 
4. Started meditating. I am not very progressive, so this was weird for me at first. But deep breathing exercises and mediation which focuses on pushing away negative thoughts really helped me calm down if I was about to have a panic attack.

So you have anxiety, or you think you might have anxiety. No worries, it’s a normal thing. That’s one big thing to remember: it’s normal. 

If you’re the unsure case, well, we need to know what anxiety is. Anxiety defined: a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, typically about an imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome.

Now, there are a few different major categories of anxiety. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Phobia (Social, Specific), Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. While it’s never good to self-diagnose, you can probably self-evaluate with a simple Google search to best learn what exactly is going on.

Anxiety is, for the most part, caused by adrenaline. Yes, the same thing that helps you avoid split-second car accidents, and gets your libido on. Some of our brains dump adrenaline at the most inopportune time; it’s too much of a good thing.

Once you know what’s going on, you can further analyze with behavioral analysis. Ask yourself:

* Stimulation - what were you doing?
* Thought - what were you thinking?
* Emotion - what were your emotions?
* Body Sensation - heartbeat, hot, cold, shaky
* Joy level - 1 to 5, where 5 is very joyous and 1 isn’t joyous whatsoever.
* Misery level - 1 to 5, where 5 is miserable and 1 isn’t miserable.
* Action - how did you act upon when stimulation?
* Going into the situation, what were your resources/strengths?
* Going into the situation, what were your vulnerabilities?
* Trigger - if any?
* What actions were helpful?
* What actions made the situation worse?

If you accumulate enough data, like anything, you can begin to understand it better. 

Then, there are some life hacks:

* Avoid caffeine - it’s a stimulant, and stimulants have properties that invoke anxiety.
* Avoid stimulants - see above.
* Physical stimulus - do something, be active, even if very simple. Stress ball, taking a walk, wrestling with your puppy. If your temperature goes up, your anxiety goes down.
* Have food in your stomach - you know how when you’re hungry, you’re often cranky? Yep, same concept applies here.
* If you’re medicated, make sure you’re keeping a steady habit of taking your medications.
* Sleep is vital. Don't get too much, but don't get too little. 7-9 hours is great.

Now, in some cases, such as social phobia, there isn’t really enough time to do that 10-step questionnaire (“hold on - feeling an onset of panic - gotta fill out this form!”). Why do we have social phobia? Well, it’s a natural thing. Some of us are just more natural than others. Common characteristics of social phobia is an extreme worry of scrutiny or judgement by others - most often by people around your age. That last bit is very key: by people around your age. For example, I’m great around parents, elders, and little kids, but if you bring someone +- 5 years of me, I’m a shitshow.

The best way to overcome such situations is desensitizing yourself. Think of it like playing the same song over and over and over (...) until you get sick of it. Well, same applies here: if you do the same thing over and over, soon, you’ll become less sensitive to the situation. It sucks at first, and remember it only gets better after that. Each time you’ll become less and less sensitive.

If you’re having a panic attack in a relaxed, laid-back environment, and are able to take a timeout, do some four-count breathing:

* In for four seconds.
* Hold for four seconds.
* Out for four seconds.
* Repeat for four minutes.

My wife is getting fed up with me, as did my last wife.

As have all of my groups of friends over the years. As have people I worked with. On and on the list goes. It kills me so much because people just roll their eyes, or even laugh. In my mind it's reality.

 I can't look at someone and tell them not to see that grass is green. I can't tell someone not to feel a burn on their hand when they touch a hot stove. Just like I can't see it any other way that these ideas and suspicions that creep into my head are laughably impossible.

I worry about having about 20 different health conditions a year. Adding in about a new 5 as each year passes. I come to terms that I don't have others, but something new always comes in to replace that one. 

It just goes on and on, and though I thankfully haven't passed these tendencies into my children...they now see me in the same light as others. My son laughs and rolls his eyes at me. My wife tells me I worry about everything and gets pissed that I can't just be happy. She says I'm unreasonable and that I don't look at things logically. YET in my mind I'm using nothing but logic. 

In my mind it feels like she leaves everything up to chance. I feel like stress is protecting me from forgetting important details, from being careless when I hand in paperwork that's important. I feel like stress makes me a good father because my kids don't go without anything. It makes me humble and a good worker.

Yet I feel like it's destroying my life. It has destroyed my life, more and more consuming everything as each year passes.

I take the medications that are supposed to work. They are supposed to be the alternative. They don't work, they don't help they just make me blank. Sometimes shit still creeps in, and I still just have to talk to someone. I have to vent I have to feel better, because if I say it, and I hear it, sometimes it sounds so stupid that I do laugh about it.

And my wife sits there and gets frustrated, and I go ""I'm sorry, I know this gets old.""

To which she replies...""::sigh:: it's fine. I'm used to it.""

I'm starting work out of state away from them for a while, so that maybe giving them space from me will help things and they won't be so burnt out by me. I'll only be home a couple of days a week, but it hurts. I'm going to miss so much of my children's life. and I'm going to be so alone. I just don't know how to deal with any of this anymore. I'm not suicidal or anything, I just want to be happy and have my family happy to have me around.

Know it's just an anxiety trigger.,mfoste34,87,21,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1g3h5u/a_lot_of_people_freaking_over_weed_know_its_just/,"I've seen a lot of younger folk freak out about weed. There are a lot of horror stories, especially if you Google, about kids who took some tokes and then had ""brain problems"" or the like. There's also people who complain of having done permanent damage.

Just know this--these people have anxiety problems. Weed is good for some with social anxiety and the like, but it can also be an anxiety trigger...especially for those who have hypersensitivity anxiety. 

Anxiety, especially acute physical anxiety, is a terrible cycle caused by a trigger...something that puts you in a full panic, which raises your mind's awareness of a state that it's not used to (or, is out of its equilibrium). When you experience a panic attack, it's kind of like your mind leaves auto pilot and you are suddenly grabbing for the controls. You freak. Panic attacks are very energy depleting and traumatic for the mind. This causes negative thinking and fear, as well as fear of the physical change you feel, which causes more fear, negative thinking, end so on. 

Eventually, panic attacks start a cycle of daily worry, stress and exhaustion that doesn't normally occur to a calm body. This is a manifestation of physical anxiety disorder, which will be tabbed as ""GAD"" by general doctors. I've been to so many different types of visits to assure myself. 

But, what assures me is that my first anxiety trigger happened a year ago when I used a harmless menthol solution that I used to fix a sore lip. Yeah-- it caused the same panic attack and a 5 month long battle with completely foreign and frightening symptoms that I had to fight off each day. I quit drinking, began exercising, etc. I won that fight and spent three months feeling like $1 million. I felt AMAZING! FREE!! SOOOO DAMN HAPPY!!!

Now I'm fighting the same fight again thanks to a mistake with some weed...but it's the same fight. So, hopefully this calms anyone who has had any type of substance trigger GAD. It's hard to accept and understand the problem...and many who don't are the ones writing the horror stories on other forums.

Acute GAD can be caused by one panic attack, and that panic attack can be caused by a number of triggers. There's dozens of anxiety symptoms that are mental and physical that are all related to the same problem. If you don't attack what's attacking you, you will get nowhere. 

But...there's a reason weed is being legalized, and so many use it with no problem. It doesn't do anything like that to the brain...your anxiety is doing that to you. It was just simply caused by a scary situation. 

Not saying smoking can't trigger full on GAD...it can. But, ANYTHING, if it be a negative to your mind, can trigger this cycle of panic and anxiety disorder. Just know you are dealing with the same documented medical issue that so many of us have...and not same rare, unreversable problem that has doomed you. So many seem so discouraged because of that thought process.

Does anyone else experience this?

I'm a great listener, but when it comes to keeping a conversation going, or moreso starting one, I always struggle to come up with something to say. I am shy, yes, but I do genuinely like hanging out with people and generally don't like to be a loner (&amp; stay at home all the time wishing I had plans). I find it incredibly hard to make friends when I come off as aloof or disinterested, when I'm actually just unsure of what to say next.

I'm so envious of people that can shoot off funny one-liners and tell good stories. I feel like I have no good stories!

This ultimately convinces me that I'm just a boring person with nothing to offer the world and no passions. I let my shyness and uncertainty get in the way to trying new things and exploring possible passions. 

I guess I'm looking to connect with other folks who may feel this way or similarly. I have always wanted to be outgoing and have felt happiest in my life in the rare times I've been comfortable enough to be and had a lot to say. The other 99% of the time I'm shy, quiet, and feel like I thus make others uncomfortable and not want to be around me. It's like I'm an extrovert (who needs the energy of social interaction) inside the thick shell of an introvert.

tl;dr- I feel like an extrovert trapped in the shell of an introvert and wish I had more things to say(one-liners, stories, small talk) to break the ice and thus my introvert shell. DAE feel this way?

Hearing about other people getting better always helped give me hope, so I thought I'd share in case it helps anyone else.",KTKins77,72,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1cflwg/i_graduated_from_therapy_hearing_about_other/,"Hi r/Anxiety!  I've posted here a couple times with questions and asking for advice, and you've always been wonderful and so helpful.  If anyone is reading this that feels uncomfortable asking for help or advice, this is a really great place to start.  Everyone is so supportive and non-judgemental!


I felt uncomfortable with the idea of therapy for my anxiety for a long time.  I've been pretty functional most of my life, and even when my anxiety starting getting worse about 6 months ago, I still worried that it ""wasn't bad enough"" to warrant professional help.  I was worried that maybe my anxiety wasn't that bad, and that it was just a character flaw that I couldn't deal with stressful things.  But, that was what I've deemed ""anxiety brain"" was seeing.  In the real world, I was crying and panicking almost every morning that I had to go to my easy part time job.  Physically, I was having trouble sleeping, my shoulders always ached, my bowels were almost never happy, and I could feel my heart often doing strange things.  Just because I could get myself out the door and continue with life didn't mean everything was okay.


So, I finally got into therapy after putting it off for several months.  We agreed to try therapy alone first, and that if it wasn't helping she would refer me to someone to talk about medication.  I mention this because I've seen some people here are often worried that getting help means you are going to be put on meds.  Not necessarily!  Meds are incredibly helpful for some people, but the worry about having to take meds should not keep you from asking for help!  


I saw a therapist once a week for about 4 months, and she feels like I'm doing well enough to stop for now.  With the added note that I can always call if I'm having trouble and want a ""tune up"" session = ).  I've been feeling better, and it was really validating to hear it from her too!  I'm come to terms with the fact that I'm never going to be anxiety free.  But, seeing a therapist really helped give me better tools to deal with it as it comes.  I still feel like I'm more anxious than the average person, but it doesn't bog me down like it used to.  So last I wanted to add some things that I feel like really helped me.

1. Therapy.  Literally, this is the number 1 thing that helped.

2. Keeping a regular sleep schedule.

3. Meditation, on a regular basis and as-needed when I start feeling the anxiety creep up.

4. Keeping a journal.  Writing down my anxious thoughts helps get them out of my head.  And then, it's easier to challenge those thoughts and turn them around.

5. Finding things to look forward to.  I expended a ton of energy on negative things, so I have been trying to replace it to positive things.  I plan short day trips to new places.  I look up fun diy projects that I want to do.  Little things still count!

6. I drink a lot of hot tea.  Sometimes specifically ""relaxing"" or ""anti-anxiety"" labeled teas.  But I honestly also just enjoy the process of making and drinking tea.  I have my own little teapot, and I sit down with it and keep pouring myself tea.  It's lovely = )

7. Exercise.  Even just walking.  It always felt to me like I was burning up some sort of anxiety chemical along with the calories.

8. Podcasts.  I love podcasts.  [Mental Illness Happy Hour](http://mentalpod.com/) is a great one that specifically addresses mental illness, but in an easy going, often comedic way.  I also really love [You Made it Weird](http://www.nerdist.com/podcast/you-made-it-weird/).  It's much more comedy focused, but the host Pete Holmes often talks about his experiences with therapy, and sometimes the guests do as well.  Just hearing people talk about it sort of normalized it for me, and made it seem less scary.  Plus Pete Holmes is hilarious, and laughing always makes me feel better!

That feels really long winded, but I hope it was at least a little helpful for anyone!  If anyone has any questions I'm happy to answer. 

EDIT: Just wanted to add one more thing.  After having a low paying part time job for a long time, I just scored an interview for my ideal job!  I wasn't looking for a new job for a long time, because the thought of all the steps I had to do and all the new people I had to talk to made me incredibly nervous.  But I finally got the motivation and gumption to start looking again, and it was actually through networking and talking to people that I got the interview!  I'm hella nervous, but that just means I'll get some good meditation practice in and drink a lot of tea between now and then = )

You would never know from meeting me though. I'm personable and charming and outgoing and friendly. I'm fortunate enough to have been blessed with art skills, therefore I can get away with being the weird, nervous, arty girl. I've worked my anxiety into my personality, and it works. 

As far back as kindergarten, I was positive I would die if I walked into a classroom after the bell rang, and I would freak myself out so badly that my mom would let me stay home. 

My heart skipped a beat whenever the doorbell rang, and I would hide in the bathroom and spy out the window until they left. Forget about ringing other peoples doorbells, I literally didn't go to a friends house alone until I got a cellphone with texting capabilities so I could text them when I was outside. 

I don't call anyone, I don't walk anywhere unless I can see the path I have to walk, I frequent the same places so I don't get stuck somewhere.
The funny thing is, I love change. I love new places and new experiences, as long as I'm not alone. 

Anytime I get asked out or someone wants to befriend me, I immediately get sick. I don't have many friends, the ones I do have aren't aware of my anxiety. My boyfriend is amazing and super supportive, and my dog is the only thing that can really calm me down. It probably doesn't help that I'm scared of any and all medications. My boyfriend had me try marijuana for the first time last week. We smoked every day for the past week and a half, and I've found it doesn't help anything, it just makes me feel sick and my head hot. 

I've tried talking to my family, but my parents, as great as they are, have their own lives and are unreceptive most of the time. My panic attacks are always quiet and I'm alone so much that no one ever sees them, so it never got brought up while I was living with them. My sister thinks I'm being dramatic and keeps telling me to just ""get over it"" and that I'm just asking for attention. I believed her for a long time. I figured I was just overreacting and that I need to get over it. 

Up until today, I didn't know this was a real disorder. I just thought I was weird. 

I recently got hired at a restaurant. I'm completely capable of waiting tables without freaking out too badly. I hide it well. I'll say something stupid, stumble, drop some silverware, and walk away from a table with my cheeks burning and a death wish in my head, but I can control it on my face. When I get through a table without any triggers, I literally get emotional and have to hold back tears of joy. It's hard, but I thought I could handle another waitressing job. 

Yesterday, the thing that got me was the calendar app on my phone. I set 3 or 4 alarms for each shift so that I show up on time, and the app displays my next shift whenever I check my phone. I'm used to it, which is why this was strange. Every time I looked at my phone, I had a panic attack. Just the simple green box that said ""Server - 3:00"" set me off. As I get closer and closer to 3, I feel worse and worse. 

That's when I found r/anxiety. 

So now, I've been sitting here crying for the past hour, reading through all these posts, because I had no idea that what I'm feeling isn't normal, and that I can potentially do something about it. 

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm still deciding if I can go to work today. I've got 2 hours. Right now, I'd rather just do a no call/no show, and sleep the rest of the day. I texted my mom and told her I'm serious about seeing a doctor, because I can't let this affect my life anymore. I think 22 years is enough.

1353713152.0,61,self.Anxiety,13otge,I called in sick on Black Friday due to anxiety-related reasons and now I fear losing my job. I can't win. Hugs appreciated. [rant],boobookins95825,67,6,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/13otge/i_called_in_sick_on_black_friday_due_to/,"For thanksgiving I visited my parents, who live about five hours away from where I currently do. I had to work at 11:00 today (small coffee shop/restaurant), and the plan was for me to wake up at 4:00 am and drive back so I could enjoy Thanksgiving dinner with my family and make it to work on time.

By 4:00 I had slept less than two hours due to stressing about the drive and other family issues. I started panicking and crying, knowing that I was going to have a full on panic attack if I attempted the drive (I've dozed off at the wheel before, which is terrifying and something I never want to do again.) My mom and I decided that calling in sick so I could get some sleep and drive up later would be the best plan of action.

I called at 7:00 am (we open at 6:30 and I was so nervous and guilty about calling in), and it turned out someone else scheduled today had already called in sick. My boss had some choice words for me, especially when she found out I was still five hours away and ""couldn't make it if I tried"" (her words), especially when she ""gave me the whole week off,"" (not true, we were closed Thursday, a coworker who owed me a favor worked for me on Tuesday, and I happened to have Monday off. The only day I requested off was Wednesday.) 

I don't blame her for being upset. I feel like I've let down my boss, my fellow employees, my family, and most of all myself. I worry that I might not have a job after this, which is fine when you're 16 and still live with your parents. I'm 24, with a (useless) bachelor's degree, and this was the only job I can get while I attend more school to try and make my degree less useless. I now realize how stupid of me it was to think that I could actually wake up that early and get to work on time with my history of anxiety and trouble sleeping. 

And this is what I hate the most about anxiety, and all mental disorders. Things that seem so easy for everyone else, like making phone calls or even just sleeping, become huge obstacles. And I can't tell my boss what's really going on because I know she won't care or believe me. I'm watching all my peers become successful adults while I can't even make it to my shitty barista job. I know I am capable of so much more but the littlest things are so hard and sometimes I just want to give up.

I'm currently typing this at a busy Starbucks about 1/3 of the way home. I still feel awful and am having trouble concentrating on the road. I dread going to work tomorrow and especially Monday, when my boss will be back. I don't really know what to do, I just want my bed and my cat.

The look on my son's face was so amazing.  He was so happy.  

My husband and son took the train ride through the free roaming area.  My daughter is still a baby so an hour train ride with her would have been rough.  Usually this would have caused a PANIC.  Being alone in a park with the baby and strangers.  But instead her and I split an ice cream cone and went for another walk to see the otters and owls.  It was a nice, relaxing hour with just her.

The meds are working.  Breathing is working.  Talking about my problems is working.  I felt like a totally new person.  Only 2 or 3 weeks ago I was telling you guys how my life was crumbling.  I put a little effort into it and it feels great.  

Going to the zoo for some people might seem like a normal, non stressful event.  You guys have no (well actually you all do!) idea how big of a deal this is.

**Why I am writing this** I've been meaning to post here for awhile because I feel like as a 'survivor' of panic disorder and depression that I have, in a way, let down those who still suffer daily. I find that people who have made major improvements and have gotten their lives back rarely ever speak about anxiety or panic, especially on the internet in public forums like these. Maybe it is a result of the stigma associated with mental disorders, I'm not sure.

Anyways, I just wanted to come in here and let everyone know it gets better. Seriously, you really can beat this. I know you, as a current sufferer, likely read a ton of stuff on here and other websites about how difficult of a time others are having. Many talk about how they have had to deal with panic disorder for their entire lives and have ""accepted"" the idea that they are going to live with this for the rest of their lives. There is often a giant sense of hopelessness; I know . I just want to quickly write out my story and let everyone know that there are in fact people out there who really do beat this and go on to find happiness and success in life.

**Background on my history with anxiety and panic:** I started suffering from panic attacks around age 15, after experimenting with a number of drugs (marijuana daily, mushrooms, MDMA, few other small things). Things got bad fast; I stopped going out and seeing my friends. Grades dropped big time. I began taking SSRIs and ativan. After trying a few, I found that Celexa worked. At age 17, after about 2 years on Celexa (40mg) I began to taper off because I wasn't experiencing any symptoms anymore. I thought it was just a phase I was going through. 

Sure enough, the panic attacks came back and even stronger this time. I went back to my doctor and immediately got back on ativan, which I began taking 5-7 times a day, and also started trying out a slew of other SSRIs (tried Celexa again, wasn't working anymore). My panic disorder spawned into full depression and stuff got real bad. I nearly failed high school, I was barely eating, rarely left my room. Thoughts of killing myself crossed my mind at multiple times. I had no friends, couldn't keep up a job, was terrified to leave my bed and absolutely hated myself and life.

**Getting help** My doctor finally asked me if I would try seeing a psychologist. At this point in time, I thought it wouldn't do any good and had accepted the fact that my life was going to be this mess forever. Anyways, I ended up making the appointment and  going weekly. My psychologist 'formally' diagnosed me with panic disorder and depression - I scored 99th-100th percentile in all areas on the standardized severity test I took (forgot what it's called). My psych was also a bit of a hard-ass but we had an excellent doctor-patient relationship. (I still remember on day 1, going in there and I immediately started talking about how horrible my day was and how crippling anxiety is. My psych interrupts after five minutes and says, ""Listen, your parents are paying quite a bit of money right now just to have you sit here and complain. Our time is limited and I did not spend a decade in University to have you sit here and complain. We have work to do."" It was a real eye opening moment.)

I guess the 'secret' to my success with anxiety, panic and depression was a strict regiment of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy(CBT). This included daily monitoring logs, lot's of reading, lots of writing, along with various other lifestyle improvements (exercise, some mindfulness meditation, etc.). I immediately started seeing improvements after a few weeks. It wasn't easy though: CBT is tough, real fucking tough. It was the most difficult thing I have ever had to go through, but trust me when I say this it works damn well. You just have to put in the work. After 8-10 months of regular visits I woke up one morning and realized I wasn't scared anymore. The anxiety and panic were gone. It was like how life was before except even better. I now had a much clearer understanding of my emotions, behaviour and thoughts. I had the tools to deal with anxiety when it appeared and the panic attacks had fucked right off. I kept seeing my psychologist for an additional 3-4 months after this for life and career help (I had previously nearly failed my first year of University and wanted to head into second year with a renewed focus).

**Today** So, in short, today I sit here at age 24 as a completely changed person. Some notable highlights are:

* The old me nearly failed high school and first year of university. Today, I am a month away from starting a Masters degree at one of the top universities in my country. I have a full scholarship. 
* Previously, I was overweight and physically unwell. Now, I live much healthier.  I began running years ago and can now complete a 5km run in under 20 minutes (19:52). I have also been training for a half-iron man race which happens at the end of the month. 
* Before I had trouble walking down the street to check the mail. In February I flew to Spain by myself and vacationed for 10 days.
* I had a horrible time meeting girls and knew nothing about dating or sex. I've had multiple girlfriends these past view years from a variety of walks of life. While none of them lasted very long I am still having an absolute blast with dating and whatnot.
* I thought I would be taking SSRIs and ativan for the rest of my life. Today I sit here medication free for years now (not that there is anything wrong with medication, but if you feel like you don't need it than why bother).
* I'm content. Life isn't always easy but as sufferers of anxiety and panic we know the difference between tribulations like the death of a friend, and well, dealing with this shit on a daily basis. I love the direction I have taken my life and I'm very excited for whatever the future may hold.

So, again, trust me when I say it gets better. I am no one special. I grew up an average/below average kid in almost all facets in life. Nothing remarkable about me, no genius IQ as a child or any of that shit. Just a normal kid who developed a crippling panic disorder. I just want everyone to know that they can beat this shit and accomplish things they never thought possible. If you would have asked me 6 years ago what my life would be like today, I would have answered ""likely would have killed myself by then"". CBT might not be for everyone, I'm not a doctor, but it worked for me. See a psychologist, they're doctors and have an incredible amount of knowledge that can help you. If things don't work out with one, keep trying until you find one you really connect with. I know this shit is expensive but it will be the best investment you have EVER made.

TL:DR: Got severe anxiety and panic when I was a teenager, likely due to experimenting with drugs. Took SSRIs and benzos for years. Life reached a new low and finally saw a psychologist. After a year of hard work, I came out changed for the best and prepared for the world. It can get better, you don't have to live the rest of your life like this.

I wish I had a place like this to go to while I had anxiety and depression, it's an awesome support system, keep it up!
I just wanted to offer some practical tips and ideas for getting through the worst of anxiety, depression, panic ect.

1. Talk to your doctor. 
You have a chemical imbalance that may or may not fix itself. There's no shame in considering medication. Taking medicine turned my life around, find the one that's right for you, I tried three before I found one that doesn't make me hazy.

2. Talk with the ones you love. 
Even though it's hard at first, I found huge relief in explaining exactly how I was feeling to my close friends and family. Also, from talking with them I found a surprising amount of them had at one point had some of the same feelings I was having, which made me feel way less alone.

3. Watch kids movies. :)
 It might sound funny but it helped me a lot. 

4. Be active enough that you want to go to bed at night.
For me, anxiety caused a really unhealthy cycle of staying inside all day, not being tired, laying awake in bed because of anxiety, sleeping in, repeat. Even though it feels like the hardest thing in the world to do, go outside. Walk around, exercise, go to the store, even just driving around. 

5. Wake up everyday and choose to fight it.
This might not be for everyone, but for me, part of getting better was going from being a victim to a fighter. If you have it, you know it's a battle. It's the hardest thing I've ever experienced. So rise above it, be brave, choose to live on in spite of it.

I'm rooting for all of you :) it will get better, keep fighting.

I get sick to my stomach as soon as I'm presented with learning material. I don't know how to ask for help. Beyond learning, I can't seem to follow through with anything in life because thinking about taking any steps forward makes me sick to my stomach, I start panicking and hyperventilate. 

I've been pretending to go to class for over a year, but instead I just sit in my car and have breakdowns.

I told my parents I'd pay for my community college classes, and the ones I failed out of I am still in debt for because I barely make enough to make payments at my job. I want to go back, but I can't afford it yet and I'm scared I'll fail out again. I don't think I can get a loan, my credit is probably already horrible.

I don't know how to tell my parents what's going on, I don't want them to treat me like they treated my sister, she went insane when they put her on anti-depressants. I spent most of my youth with a padlock on my bedroom door because she would steal from me and sometimes she got violent (She never hurt me, but did dislocate my mother's jaw, and they fist fought. I always held my mother after these fights and promised not to dissapoint her)

I have no friends. I go to a therapist sometimes for the assault situation but I don't like going because being there just reminds me of what happened. 

I want to find proper help, but I can't afford it, and I'm scared of medications. I'm scared to ask my parents, I don't think they can go through this again. They've said so before.

Last night I was having a hard time dealing with anxiety over having to move. At 1:00 am, I took a 1mg risperidone (that I was prescribed a long time ago - I'm not on any meds now) to help me sleep. At 1:30, I was playing Skyrim, when the worst panic attack I've ever had began. I became so dissociated that I wondered whether or not I even existed. I figured ""I think, therefore I am"", but still felt really dissociated. I went outside for a smoke. The nicotine helped with the dissociation, but when I got back in I started to have full blown panic - the worst I've ever had. I tried to call a crisis hotline, but the only phone I have access to can't receive calls, and this was one of those stupid hotlines that has to call you back. I wrote down some of the things stressing me out (this always seems to help), and by 2:30 I was feeling mostly normal after watching some Futurama for a bit.

It's been quite a while since it's been at a level where it completely debilitated me and fingers crossed that I can maintain management of it now. 


In those times when it was unbelievably terrifyingly bad, depression hit strong as your mind starts focusing on thoughts like 'is this the rest of my life now', 'is it ever going to end', 'can I stand this for the rest of my life/do I want to live it' etc.... You begin to think and act on this assumption that it is going to last forever. 

Having had it for awhile now where I've been through so many waves of better and worse, better and worse I realized that no one feeling/sensation/thought/attack/whatever is going to last forever. 

Usually, the saying 'nothing lasts forever' has negative connotations (i.e. life, childhood, fun etc..) but it's also true for all the bad stuff in life (i.e. pain, anxiety, depression, stress etc..). This train of thought took emphasis off the symptoms I experience on a day to day level. I knew that when I felt horrible, I knew it was going to pass eventually. Over time, what this did was allow my brain to maintain focus on other things and less on my symptoms and I began to notice they weren't as obtrusive and severe as they once was.

Push ups.. Seriously, just did 100 of them and it relieved so much pressure. I don't feel dizzy or lightheaded from the anxiousness.  Right after I was done my heart did pound pretty hard, but I rode through it and the result was a more confident relaxed body.   
I'm in decent shape, so if you can't do that many no big deal.  When our bodies go into that fight or flight mode and nothing happens, that's when we start hyperventilation and the carbon monoxide makes us light headed and what not.  Any physical activity is what your body is waiting for, it's expecting you to do something with the anxiety.  If you can only do 10 that's perfect!  Make sure you really exhaust yourself.  Your body is awaiting a tough strain, it's basically getting you prepped. 
I was working out all the time when the anxiety hit and instead of pushing through it, cutting out caffeine consumption and altering my workout.  I just stopped all physical activity, kept the caffeine and was also trying to stop drinking so much alcohol. It overwhelmed me.

An anxiety totem.,AT0M801,60,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/x1eka/hey_ranxiety_this_is_something_that_has_worked/,"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life having severe panic attacks multiple times a week. Anyone who has had a panic attack knows the vicious cycle of them, you panic and as there is no actual danger to speak of you think that maybe something is wrong with you (cancer, heart failing, psychosis etc) which in turn makes you MORE anxious extending the panic attack and making it worse. After becoming familar with this feeling after years of attacks I started to notice that all of the symptoms were the same with each attack, and afterwards I would feel almost silly for freaking out so much. I knew this was all in my head and nothing was actually wrong, mostly I was just feeling the physical effects of the panic attack so here's where I got creative. After watching the movie inception I was fascinated by the idea of their totems, the objects they would use to determine if what they were experiencing was real or not. So one day when my anxiety was very, very low I decided to get one. In my current mental state I KNEW that nothing was wrong with me and the feelings I was experiencing were not actually real but,that sometime soon I would loose that perspective and start thinking that there was. I took an old brass key and started creating a mental way point of sorts, when I was having an attack I would hold the key and remeber that in a much better mental state I had determinded that nothing was wrong and that I would be just fine as soon as the attack passed. The key serves as a metaphor for me, I imagine myself shutting a door between myself and the fear that I am feeling and locking it. I then imagine myself turning around an unlocking a door that contains positive thoughts. I found this silly until it actually worked, and has been working every since. I trust that when i'm in the middle of an attack I am in no state to determine if something bad is actually happening and when I'm not having one I find it almost silly I could get so worked up. So I suggest you all try this, find a small object that you can keep on your person and spend some time focusing on it and reminding yourself that you are okay. When a bout of anxiety hits take out your totem and hold it in your hands while taking some deep breaths while reminding yourself that in a much better state you knew you were okay and that this feeling will pass.

I can slow down the wild anxiety train/snowball, if you will, using my own willpower and mindfulness. This is something that I would always tell myself is what I should do, but I now have figured out how to actually put in to practice. My symptoms were really that of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. My friend suggested that I tell him what the worries are as they occur to me, and he'll tell me how much it seems that they are grounded in reality. The more this is repeated, the more I will get better at recognizing the gradients of value and importance in my anxious thoughts on my own. I will also practice on my own, but it will help at first to have a non-judgmental third party to call me out.

It helps me to articulate this and maybe even get feedback, and I just found out that there was an anxiety subreddit, so that's why I posted, in hopes of helping others as well. I posted this in r/Buddhism because it's related to an idea that fits with Buddhism but it is really also a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy application.
I read the entire book ""Buddhism on the Couch,"" which involved just this subject of the combination of Buddhism and psychotherapy. But this revelation, to me, cements the importance of needing to find out a truth through direct experience, as opposed to reading it and assuming you have understood it.
It's like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders! (Another expression that I always hear, but really understand what it's describing right now.)

I want to mention another very important part of this discovery. It almost seems counter-intuitive, but the key thing that it takes is humility and sacrificing pride. And it can be the most difficult thing.  It takes humility in order to recognize that all thoughts you have might not be right, and might not be based in reality. It is funny that even though they are damaging thoughts, they are so automatic and you have the desire to cling to them so strongly.  They are just a habit you are accustomed to. 

I hadn't realized that the way I lived might be abnormal for the longest time, because my family was all the same way, I couldn't imagine how anybody else was any different. It is almost like I identified with the anxiety, it was a part of me that I was used to and almost accepting of. When someone commented to me ""you seem nervous"" while I was talking to them at my job I replied back ""yeah, that's just me.""

But one of the key things is not being attached to the anxiety as a tied in part of who I am.

The other key thing is what I want to call the ""recursive worry"" or the ""self-referential"" worry. Which is to say, the worry that you are worrying too much. If you can look at this as just a looping cycle that goes nowhere and accept that these worries are going to enter your brain out of simple habit, not out of any personal fault, then it is much easier to let go of them. If you can forgive yourself for them when they occur, they lose their strength. In an internet metaphor, it's almost like you're ""feeding the troll"" when you criticize and punish yourself mentally for your own recurring thoughts. They will just grow more and take more persistence and practice to cut down.

The worries are weeds choking the tree that is your mind/body. And you can affect your bodily symptoms by changing what is in your mind, because your mind is body and your body is mind. They are one thing and inseparable.

You cling to worry because it's what is comfortable to you. But this is where attachment comes in, and how you can not be attached to any possible outcome of what could happen when you stop worrying. Bad things will still happen even if you don't worry about them, but you will be more prepared and centered when they do happen and what is bad will not be exaggerated and compounded. It's kind of like....if you panic and overcorrect a mistake while driving, it will just make everything worse.

But you have to know that you are capable of being centered, calm, and present. Know it, and be it. The brain is malleable and any pattern of anxiety is just a practiced habit. You can rewire the circuits your own brain by re-training it, but you need to have patience, love for yourself even when you fall back on the habits.

I'll give you an example of the conversation I was having with my friend. The things I most often worry about are pleasing other people and whether I am being judged by other people. I didn't realize how often thoughts like this occurred to me until I just really started paying attention to it. And even then over time I would criticize myself for always worrying. This is something small, but Jeremy's friend Travis wanted to play a video game with him online, but Jeremy and I were talking and hanging out, Jeremy told him he would play in about an hour. After an hour Jeremy decided against it because he was preoccupied with talking to me and starting a painting he got an idea for. The worry that started in my head then was ""I hope Travis isn't really bored now because he doesn't get to go play online with his friend tonight, I hope I don't monopolize Jeremy's time and that he can still spend enough time with his friends."" But then that thought grew larger and I thought ""What if Travis had a bad day and was just hoping to come back and be able to relax by playing a game with his friend."" At the same time I tell myself this is probably all irrational and I shouldn't spend the next hour dwelling on it, but the snowball has gained momentum by then and it is like an obsession, slapping down any rational challenge. So I tell this to Jeremy and he goes what? No, I stopped thinking about the Travis thing within 5 minutes. We have plenty of time to play Borderlands.

So I started a thing with Jeremy where if the worry came in to my head and I noticed it and didn't just let it create a fake reality, I would tell it to him, and he could tell me it was silly, and then I could let it go. I am going to bridge from this by teaching myself not to be afraid of or attached to any particular outcome. That way I am not setting myself up for anxiety. *Because if I am afraid of a particular outcome, that fear will color my perception of what actually happens.* I interpret an expression on someone's face or a tone of their voice in a way that confirms my made-up fear. It blinds me to what is actually happening.

One thing I am very good at is coming up with all of the possible judgments someone could have about what I am saying or what I doing, and then just assuming that those judgments are real. It limits me and makes me constantly doubt myself because of my ability to challenge and knock down every thought I have in multiple ways. What I can do is turn this to my advantage, I can recognize what might be any of the particular outcomes of a situation, and not be attached to a particular one.  You can't completely control what does or does not happen.  But if you don't have any preconceived expectation of how you want things to happen, you will not set yourself up for anxiety.  If you aren't attached to a particular outcome, you will have no reason to worry or to attribute any diversion from the course to personal shortcomings.  You can't expect yourself to manage things in the way you exactly want to at all times.

I didn't realize the amount of things that my worrying affected. It affects my attention span, lots of times I would not have heard someone calling my name or I didn't hear a complete story because I was already off in my head doubting something or worrying about something. I couldn't pay attention to the present. All in all it will take practice and training. It will be difficult at first, kind of like starting to exercise. Your mind will respond to practice the same way your muscles respond to training and exercise. You might veer off the path, but you have to forgive yourself.  You can view each new worry and each new source of anxiety as an opportunity to better yourself.  You have to practice being mindful, and to sort of ""catch"" yourself in different worries.  It can be easy to miss them because you are so accustomed to your regular thought patterns.  

Anyway, let me know if you have any questions and I hope this helps.  
Have a good night/day. :)

The reason I'm posting about it is doing something like this might help others like I can feel it helping me. I'm currently unemployed and looking for work, and it's taken me a long time to work up the gumption to look for a little bit of volunteer work to fill the time. My main goal was to volunteer doing something that made me happy.

The barn I volunteered at today is attached to a school for children with special needs (medical, disabilities, etc). Some of the kids get lessons that are, more or less, equine therapy for them. My job was to be in charge of the horses and lead them around the ring. I have some horse experience, but even so I was very nervous about today. What if the animals could sense my anxiety? Would that make things more dangerous for the kids?

Actually, my anxiety lessened a lot when I was around the horses (and one pony). It was almost like biofeedback, where you can visually see what your mental state is doing. So I made a point to relax, and the horse next to me relaxed. By the end of the fourth lesson and the end of my volunteering time I wasn't at all anxious. There were even some instances where the horses would presses their noses or heads against me affectionately, as if they liked me and I made them feel better for being there.

It was so nice to feel like I can do good again. If you have an opportunity to just give a little time to something like this it's worth it for you. Even if it's only an hour a week. Today, honestly, was therapy for me that was effective in a way that pills and professionals are not. Both have their place, but this was just...different. And good.

1351361218.0,53,self.Anxiety,126jge,Here's some of my thoughts on how to deal with anxiety. They may or may not help you.,,60,7,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/126jge/heres_some_of_my_thoughts_on_how_to_deal_with/,"*Quick back story:* 

I'm a 28 year-old guy and I started feeling really bad anxiety symptoms about 2 years ago. I would describe myself as queitly confident and the anxiety just hit me out of the blue and was probably due to a particular period in my life about 4 years ago where 4 people I knew/were related to, died all within a 6 month span. I had also moved cities, went back to university, and was about to embark on a new career path.

*One thing I've learned:*

**Anxiety is horrible.** 

Absolutely horrible. And until you've experienced it, it's very hard to relate to someone with it. It eats away at your confidence and drains the colour from your life. For me, at its worst, every day became an exhausting battle just to be able to do very seemingly normal things.

I think the crux of it (for me, at least) is that I'm constantly worried that my body will do something and embarrass me. On the one hand I can see that this is a totally irrational fear but on the other, the fear is incredibly strong.

It's like anxiety likes to try and latch on to anything it can to induce the fear response and the ocd thoughts.

I'm gonna write out some of what I've went through (and am still going through). It's crazy and sometimes very laughable (and embarassing!) but here it is:

* fear of wetting myself
* fear that I'll get an erection
* fear that I'll ejaculate
* fear that I'll faint
* fear that my hands will noticibly shake

The fear of getting an erection is a very laughable one. But c'est la vie, it is what it is!

Personally this manifests in the desire to constantly check myself, especially when I'm wearing shorts in the gym.

""Am I getting an erection?""

""Is my penis sticking out?""

""Do I have a wet patch on the front of my shorts?""


People might be able to relate that these thoughts/feelings get worse when I'm in situations where I'm percieved to be trapped, i.e., driving with other people in the car, when I'm taking my coaching class, when I'm in class, when I'm sitting in lectures.

Here are some of my thoughts:

""What if I wet myself right in front of these people?""

""What if I get an erection? Does this mean that I'm a pervert? Is that a twinge a feel? Oh, god, am I getting hard? Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with me?""

All of these situations that I fear have happened exactly ZERO times in my life. They have occured many, many times in my head, but ZERO times in real life.

And that is why anxiety is a deeply irrational thing! But irrational or not, the fear response remains the same.

**So, how do I deal with it?**

* The very first thing is acceptance. Accept your body and accept your thoughts but - and this is extremely important - don't identify with them. Watch them almost like some sort of scientific experiment. Watch and accept.
* Make peace with the worst-case scenario in your head (this is obviously a very individual thing). Be ok with that worst case scenario:

""Ok, so tomorrow I'm gonna be giving some people a lift and I'm going to wet myself. Embarrassing? Yes, definitely. But the world'll keep on spinning, the sun will set, and tomorrow'll be a new day.""

When I consider that I'm on a floating rock surrounded by other members of my species and none of us know what the hell is going on, the insignificance of such an incident is mind-bogglingly small.

Now this is the difficult and scary step:

* Do everything you can to expose yourself to the fear. Really, really try to NEVER aviod a situation purely on grounds of anxitey and irrational fears. Everytime you do, you validate the fear and it grows a little stronger.
* YOU ARE A WARRIOR! When things are going crazy inside your body simply sit and breath. Do nothing else but feel the feelings, accept them, let them go, and breath. Do not try to aviod them and totally avoid any little safety-ticks that you have.
* Anxiety is a tricky little devil. It'll throw in a new bodily sensations to try and make you think that this time it's real! This time you're really gonna wet yourself! But be steadfast; do not be the first to blink! Anxiety is ultimately the wizard behind the curtain. Expose it for what it is.

For me, I want to so much look down and see if I've wet myself or if my penis is sticking out. But everytime I do, I validate it, and everytime I don't I weaken its grip on me.

And this is scary, believe me. Fear is fear, regardless of irrationality or not.

**In conclusion:**

Anxiety is perfectly normal. Trying to get rid of it is a goal that is rooted in failure because you won't. Ever. 

What we *can* do is reduce it back to a normal level because, for some reason or another, our anxiety dials have been stuck on high. For some, medication is a great way to get a handle on it, for others, it may be some sort of therapy. Our amygdala 'dial' may even revert back to a more normal level simply through time.

Our problem - and the reason we're different from other seemingly 'normal' people - is that we've become hypersensitive to our bodily sensations. Someone without an anxiety disorder has similar feelings but mostly they don't consciously register with them in the same way that they register with us.

Relax: the sensations are normal. Our body is a magnificent machine that takes care of an insane amount of tasks each and every second that we're alive. Try not to get too hung up or worried about a few twinges/tingles. Our body takes care of itself. You, by and large, are just a passenger.

I understand why you guys did what you did, or if was a mod or whatever. But jesus christ you should have messaged me first or something? I'm happy that cops like this stop people from killing themselves but it really backfired for me. Cops were super professional and shit.

EDIT: EVERYONE

Cops showed up at my house at 9:00am

Because I am traumatized from being sent to the psych ward which caused the depression/anxiety problems so bad when I was 20  this caused a massive episode of Post Tramtic flashbacks 

My parents chilled with me and helped me through it and they agreed to not send me to the psych ward.


I was never going to actually kill myself, but I was really fucking depressed.

I had a Doctor Appointment next Thursday, where I was going to tell him about everything and get helo to see a new therapist, but I don't know the likelyhood of me going now that I am re-experiencing trauma. I have my parents on speeddial and they will help me through it.

Even though it caused such severe PTSD I never knew Reddit could do this, so I'm glad that you guys may be responsible for legitly stopping suicide. But really I did not need this to happen tonight. It was so counterproductive, but it's not like anyone on reddit would have known and you have to take procautions so I'm happy you probably stopped people.

I've been dealing with anxiety for just over 5 years now. Pretty much restricted to health anxiety and panic attacks about dying suddenly. It has been getting a lot better in the last couple years but every time I have a panic attack it feels like I'll never get better. But today showed me that not only is it possible, it's happening.

I had a tooth extracted today. I was very nervous about it, about the procedure for sure, but mostly for the aftercare. Taking a new medication has always been a massive trigger for me, especially ones that have noticeable effects. And I knew I would need and be prescribed Tylenol 3s. Last time I took them (also dental I think) I had a massive panic attack and probably ended up at the emergency room feeling like an idiot as usual. [I live alone and everyone I love lives almost 5000km away so my panic attacks would generally end up in the ER since I have no one else to calm me down).

So this morning the extraction went way better than they expected. Took only a few minutes and didn't need to cut my gums or anything. I decided not to take a Clonazepam (I take as needed and very rarely now) and try to tough it out. It was tough, but when it finished so quickly I was so relieved. Then I was off to the pharmacy for those dreaded Tylenol 3s...

It's now almost 10 hours later and I have NOT had a panic attack. I have just been chilling on the couch all day, watching tv and playing videogames. There has been some minor anxiety when I take each pill but I've been able to brush it off and I am almost in disbelief. 

A big trigger for me is not feeling like myself which is why I stopped doing all drugs and am wary of new medication since I developed anxiety. This is the first time since that I've dealt with something like this as a normal person and not someone who thought she was going to be found in two weeks cold and dead on the floor.

And there will never be one word or phrase or paragraph in a textbook that will explain it fully, especially since it manifests so differently in so many people (and even within the same people, it will do so differently in different situations).

Does anyone else feel like theres just ""television static"" in their head?  Not the NOISE from it, not the image or anything like that, just a weird...sensation of ""buzzing"" going on in your mind.  You can't shut it off, and you can't ""change the channel"" to something more rational or more productive...so it's like wasted thoughts.  They're there, they're occupying the space where rational thought and productivity SHOULD be, but at the same time its completely useless. But you can't shut it off.

I've been wanting to kill myself since I was 13 or so. I watched my mother die when I was 12. I type this out a lot in various places, but it helps. She died when I was 12, and my dad died when I was 20. Problems on top of problems.

Since my dad died, money has been a constant struggle. I'm basically leaching off of family and relying on food stamps.

I've had chances to go to college, and I've fucked up everyone my non attendance. I wrote letters to get financial aid back, but this time I think it's over. I think I'm suspended indefinitely. Without financial aid, there will be no college or career.

I had a 3.5 in high school and did well enough to get a scholarship to college. The June before my freshmen year, my dad found out he had lung cancer. He started an aggressive chemotherapy routine that destroyed his body. I lived alone with him. I never gave a fuck about college from the minute I started. I was too far down the rabbit hole of depression about losing my one last parent.

Since then, I've tried going. I'll go a couple weeks. Then one day I'll just wake up scared to go. I feel paralyzed. I feel like killing myself would be better than having to go in among people. Eventually I decided to stop putting myself through this torture and not go. Then the guilt sets in.

It's not just my education. I have horrible job experience dominated by ""no shows"" so I basically have no job experience or references at 24. The last job I had was at retail. I cried before work every morning because I hated it. I would cut myself and drink Jack Daniels before I went in. I'd park the car and open the bottle. 

Of course, suicidal feelings were rampant at this time. Also, homicidal feelings for the first time. I hated people, and I never had before.

While all this is happening, I started having serious health issues. My doctor believes it's MS. I can't find out because I don't have insurance or money. In my head, I've convinced myself it's worse than MS and probably an inoperable tumor. 

At this point, I can't do anything. I can't find a job that's not retail, and I can't do that. I applied for disability and was denied twice. I'm losing financial aid so no chance of helping myself. I don't know how to get help for my health.

What's worse? I'm frozen. People tell me things to do, you know. Contact these people, see about this. I'm at the point where I'm scared to call or email people. I get panicked at the thought of it and begin hurting myself.

So I'm helpless. There's literally not a god damn fucking thing I can do at this point. I have a doctor who gives me Klonopin, but I can't even leave the house to go get it. I'm too scared.

I'm pathetic and my life is meaningless.

Thanks for reading.

So if this is a normal thing for someone with anxiety, please just let me know and I will feel better about it and if not I will bring it up in my next appointment.

I realized soon after posting it in /r/depression that this probably has more to do with my anxiety than my depression (which is most likely caused by my anxiety, still figuring that part out). But it was 3 AM and I was too tired and stressed out to care without waiting to see if anyone responded. 

So, back to the topic: For example, my Mondays are always the same. I wake up, go to my two morning lectures, and go with a couple friends to get lunch. Then I have a break to maybe take a nap or just surf the internet or do homework or prepare for a quiz or whatever for a couple hours before my next class, and then after that class it's dinner and back to my room.

Now, if anyone tells me they're going to be coming over to do something (like study for an exam with me for example) and then they don't do it, it ruins my entire day. As soon as I realize that they're not showing up, I just can't go on. I lie down in my bed and either find a show to watch or sleep. I wont go to class and I can't do any work. I don't understand why this is. And unfortunately for me, it happens at least once a week. And it happened today *(Edit: now yesterday)*, which is what made me wonder if anyone else experiences this or if it's just me.

Also, I would like to add that I'm okay with things changing on a day to day or week to week basis. I don't need a routine to function (most of the time), but I do need my schedule.

I am currently 20 year old female, attending school and working.

I'm having a hard time right now. I've been seeing 2 different counselors and a Psychiatrist for the past 2 years, and have been stuck and lost. The first therapist I saw helped me out a lot. I have felt so much progress with her, especially seeing the root to my anxiety and why its gotten me to this point. But then, she left and was placed with another after a year. She's sweet, very nice and loving, but I feel like I haven't progressed much with her. And then while going to counseling I decided to go to a Psychiatric Center to try medication to calm my nerves since everything, and anything, makes me nervous. Not to mention I was feeling so numb. So I want, was diagnosed and given Prozac. It helped me out so much. I felt calm and even happy. But then after 3 months I became depressed every time I took my dose, and even got off to make sure. Then was placed on Effexor, which worked for me for the next 3 months but then it made me irritated, angry, short-tempered and even gained weight and once more stopped taking it. Then took Celexa and immediately got depressed. 

After those, I was told perhaps I was bipolar. I decided to give the idea a shot, and took Trileptal but did nothing for me--it even made me depressed. I wanted to give it a chance, but just saw I was harming myself. I even dropped my birth control and changed and no change occurred but my menstrual cycle regulating. Even been having a hard time losing weight.

It's been a month without medication.

And so, I gave up on the idea of taking medication. I am not bipolar. I am not depressed. I have anxiety. And the anxiety is making me miserable, thus causing depression. I am back to feeling numb, unable to know what I should be working on. I need help, and I want to learn how to get rid of this numb feeling. It's affected how I feel about everything, including my boyfriend. I know I love my boyfriend, but im so numb I don't feel the dread of going to work, no appetite for anything and eating gives no pleasure (I took advantage of this and i'm eating healthier), no pleasure in sex and no feeling of love towards my boyfriend.

Please, someone reach out for me. I feel like, I can't do this anymore. Like i'm slowly giving up, and I no longer want to live. 




I miss finding life pleasurable. 


Please, someone help me. The only feeling I ever feel is nothing or anxiety. '

I generally have an attack when we first start driving. My dad understands I have issues with driving so he hasn't really pushed me to do any of the things that really freak me out. 

Well today after half an hour or so, I needed to get into the center of town. There are three ways to do that. One, get on the freeway which I refuse to do right now, two is to go along a truck rout and that takes about five or more minutes longer, and third is to go through a very tight and small underpass. As we were about to turn to get onto the truck rout, I said screw it and went straight to the underpass. Now mind you, I was gripping the wheel with white knuckles and my dad was just as shocked as me. I never push myself so I have no idea why I chose to face one of my fears today. 

I was scared as all get out and the few seconds I was in there felt like forever but I am glad I did it. After I did it we stopped at a gas station so I could get out and breath.

",mauinion,52,8,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/x3lu4/my_personal_top_ten_tips_that_really_help_mid/,"I get panic attacks all the time, at first they were crippling, but now I have much better control. Here are my best tips on what to do in a panic attack.

1. Make a phone call. Doesn't have to be long, but call someone who is not a friend. Maybe call a restaurant and ask their hours, or call your cell phone company and complain about something. 

2. Do a math equation in your head. If my wife notices that I am obviously having a panic attack, she will grab my hand and say 'honey, what is 35 times 17' not like I am rainman or anything, but this really helps. It takes just long enough for my brain to completely change gears.

3. Take a huge breath, and hold it for 30 seconds, while flexing every muscle in your body. Also really helps if while you do this, you think about someone or something that really makes you angry. 

4. Diet and exercise. Caffeine has gotta go, also, get out and run until you think you will pass out, or ride a bike up a huge hill. I always feel much better, and this can give a lasting 24 hours of relief. 

5. Acupuncture. This helps relax you, and is amazing what a few needles poking at you can change in your mentality. 

6. Meditation. Every morning I wake up and pee, then go back into bed in the lotus position and try to meditate for at least 30 minutes. This really helps me keep steady all day. Seriously, google the science behind meditation, and learn it. Its your best tool.

7. Stay away from Xanax. This is a temporary band-aid which over time will make it worse. Try some herbal remedies. 

8. Have a couple cocktails.  I find just 2-3 totally takes away the symptoms, and I can do whatever I want then. (don't drive drunk).

9. Don' let your eyes wander around, and don't look at strangers. This can blow the top off of whatever control you thought you had. 

10. If you feel you need to bail, set a time limit. So, if I am really not doing well, and need to abort whatever I was doing, look at the time, and add 3 minutes. Say, I am going to abort if this doesn't get better in 3 minutes. Many times it will!

Good luck!

Edit: Here is a bonus tip: When you feel it coming on, try to keep your thoughts restricted to only what is happening in your immediate reality (every second stay in the present moment strictly), also try to keep your consciousness to encompass your whole body, instead of your brain. Then, when you know you have done that, write down what happened, what you did, and how it felt. Beating anxiety is way harder the quitting cigarettes or even cocaine. So, ring the whole army to the battle. But don't get lost in it.

I'm new to reddit and was actually inspired to join because I wanted to share something that has helped me.  I posted something similar on r/depression as I suffer from both anxiety and depression, but no one's seemed interested so far =).  

I see so many posts about different medications (and I have been on sooo many over the last 10 years) and they've helped me tremendously.  I don't know where I'd be without them.  But I'd like to have a baby so I have been working on trying to either reduce or get off them over the last 6 months.  It's been a nightmare.  Some days I couldn't get out of bed.  My anxiety at work was so bad I couldn't concentrate so I had to keep going back up to my regular dosage.

I'm very luck to have a very forward thinking doctor and he suggested that I try CES.  It's a small machine (little bigger than a cell phone) that you attach to your earlobes, wear some glasses and put on a headset.  You start a program and the light, sound and small (non painful) electrical pulses to your ears all pulse in rhythms to regulate your brain waves.  There are actually a lot of studies on it and it's considered a safe alternative therapy for anxiety and depression.

I don't know if everyone responds well to it (I was the guinea pig for my doctor; he's now trying it on all his patients) but my mood is better, I have energy and drive and I can go to work without teetering on the edge of a panic attack.  And this is with reduced meds!

Anyway, I hope this doesn't come off as an advertisement.  My response to it has just been so drastic and it's helped me so much that I want to make sure people are at least aware of its existence.  It's not cheap (my unit cost about $400) and you should have a doctor who is familiar with it to guide you, but, for me at least, it has been amazing.  I had pretty much given up on the idea of a baby since I figured I was stuck on the medication, but now I have hope again.

If anyone has any questions, please post.  I'm happy to share my story and more details about CES if anyone has any interest.  I've read all the studies I could find =).

Two weeks ago it got really bad; I had a panic attack getting stressed over a phone call, then subsequently missed the call and spent the rest of the afternoon hiding from my coworkers.  Once it became clear I wasn't going to be able to go back to my lab I walked home.  I bought new clothes for the gym instead of going back to get the ones at my desk and stayed home the next day as well, only heading back after hours.

On Monday I spoke to a clinician (calling unknown places is a huge stressor for me, so I'm pretty proud of making the appointment) who suggested SSRIs and referred me to a workshop.  I need to take a little time off work once a week to attend, and she recommended that I use the opportunity to broach the subject with my boss.

I fretted for a while and sent the email on Wednesday outlining that I would like the time off and detailing what the workshop was for.  I worked up the courage to read the response this morning.  (See, this is why I have trouble at work...)

&gt;Hi sighinide,

&gt;   No awkwardness or problems at all with this. Your health is more important than a project. By all means take the time necessary for you to attend the workshop on Wednesdays. As you say, you can make up the time on Tue/Thur by staying a little later in the day. This is your private information that will be kept private. I hope this helps. If there is anything else please feel free to approach me. I can only help if I know that there is something I can do to help. 

&gt;cheers,

No energy, no motivation and no pleasure or joy in much of anything. Just recently I made my reddit account and I browsed through all the subreddits where I thought maybe, just maybe I could connect or at least find people who understand. Well, I found /r/progresspics and was amazed at the life changing decisions that these people made to change not just their whole body image but their overall health and many of their written testimonies were eye opening for me. So many of them felt how I felt.. not just about their health but about the world in general but they made a decision. A difficult but necessary decision to change what they could. Through /r/progresspics I then found /r/Keto have been on the Keto diet for a few days and chose today to do my first workout in forever, although I'm sore and know I'm probably going to be even more sore tomorrow, it feels good to take steps forward than to stand still.

Many things in life are out of my control, but the one thing I do have control over is how I care for myself and my body. I must say.. even though today is my first time working out in a year or so, I have not felt this alive in so long and I feel great. I want to share this with /r/anxiety and will cross post to /r/depression as well because it wasn't that long ago when I felt that I was a waste of space and I didn't belong here anymore. I felt like I no longer wanted to exist.. and now I am looking forward to meeting goals, and that in itself is a goal met.

I will be honest. I have graduated from a ""good school"" about close to 4 years ago, but my depression kicked full gear in school and I graduated with a 2.9 with a ""artsy"" major.

It was 2008 when I graduated, and I realize that when I graduated, that I was graduating in the middle of the worst economic recession since the 1920's.

So I bailed on my future. My anxiety rose up, and I spend a year doing nothing but job applying. My first job interview, I fucked up. I was criticized for my clothes not being professional enough. At least they told me. The other rejections came, but they never told me why. I started to get hung up on my looks (I look 17 on my best days, 16 on most days since I am short with a baby face) After all of those fiascos, I applied for temp jobs, working on and off (mostly off) for about 3 years now.

I want a stable income and a stable good enough job. But here's the kicker: This anxiety shoots up inside of me whenever I look at job postings.

This is how the process is:

1) looks at job postings (the few times in the year that I do, it takes soo much out of me to do this part btw)

The thoughts start to race: *god, I don't like these jobs*, *god, I don't qualify for anything*, *i am obviously going to get rejected*.

Then my heart starts pumping like I am in a marathon.

*fuck*. Then I feel so fucking worthless and helpless.

I want a job, I really do. But I guess not good enough, since I can't fucking get over looking at job postings without being hit with this massive anxiety.

Writing resumes/cover letters is also horrible. I can't think of anything to say. I become a blank page.

Director of radiology at local hospital told me I can bring my cat for emotional support during extremely stressful testing!!!!,NovaLovesFrogs,50,9,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1fq95i/progress_director_of_radiology_at_local_hospital/,"**Update at the bottom.**

Greetings, /r/anxiety! I haven't been in here for a while, and I apologize, but my emotional state and anxiety have been a little high for me to come in here. Ridiculous, I know, but that's how it's been.

I really wanted to share with you something positive that feels like a huge accomplishment in my battle against anxiety.

Today is a very very stressful day, and I'm having a huge anxiety attack over it, but I'm somehow managing pretty well.

So this morning, while panicking about the events yet to unfold today, I receive a phone call informing me about an appointment tomorrow that I didn't know I had. I already have two medical appointments tomorrow and there's no way I can make it, so I reschedule.

I had an idea of what the test was supposed to be, but no one informed me of the whole details. The man on the phone goes over the details with me and once done he asks me if I still want to go through with it. This test is going to be a nightmare. Both physically and emotionally, and most people tend to back out when they hear the whole details.

I've had severe stomach issues for most of my life, so even though I absolutely do **not** want to go through with this nightmare of a test, I tell him that yes, I'll do it. Because if there's even a tiny chance that it reveals what's wrong with my stomach and leads me in the direction of healing, it'll be worth it.

He asks me if there's anything he can do for me and if I have any questions. I feel my voice catch in my throat. I know what I want to ask, but I feel like I can't. I feel like I'll be laughed at. I struggle, but I bite the bullet and explain about my anxiety and about how my cat is a great emotional support animal [we've started taking him to my medical appointments and my fiance and him camp out in the car while I'm having testing done].

I haven't registered him as an emotional support animal yet [you don't have to have the prescription to register them, but some institutions will ask to see the prescription in addition to his registration papers, I've heard and read] and I don't have a prescription for him yet because psychiatrists are in high demand in my area and I still have yet to find one I can go to.

It turns out that the man that had called me about my appointment was the director of radiology himself.

He tells me that yes, I can bring my cat in, and he'll put it in my file and let the radiologist know about it. And if *anyone* gives me *any* trouble about having Nova [my cat] with me, to call him [he then gave me his *personal* cell phone number] and he'll set things straight real fast.

He *also* told me that if I'm *ever* in radiology [even if it's during an emergency room visit] that Nova is welcome to come in with me and again, if anyone ever gives me any trouble about having him in radiology, to call his personal cell phone [at any hour, night or day] and he'll take care of it.

I started crying like an idiot while on the phone with him, thanking him over and over and over again.

So even though the events of today are still causing severe panic, my panic had been lightened somewhat by the conversation I had about this nightmare of a medical test I'm gonna have to go through.

The fact that Nova is being allowed into radiology with me [I'm not going to let him be in the room when the machine is actually running, my fiance will be taking him from the room when the machines are on] and will be allowed to comfort me between images being taken, is a huge deal to me. It feels like someone has taken a fifty pound weight off my shoulders.

**Update:** Today didn't end up as badly as we [myself and my fiance] were afraid it would. It was a really huge relief and overall we walked away unscathed.

I'm also still excited [not looking *forward to it*, I'm very emotional but not upset over it] about the phone call this post is about.",,False,,t5_2qmij,1370476767.0,,,True,t3_1fq95i,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1fq95i/progress_director_of_radiology_at_local_hospital/,

I woke up for work feeling physically ill due to my anxiety.  I knew it was because of work, but I ignored it and went to work anyway; like I've done so many times in the past.  I plagued me most of the day but I hit my limit about noon when I couldn't go further.  I called my boss, told him I was sick and had to go home early.  I had an hour drive home and on they way I just broke down in tears wondering what the hell is wrong with me.  It's not that I didn't know what was wrong, I was just in despair over the whole thing.  
  
When I got home, I knew I had to tell someone. I've never talked to anyone in person about it since I can't keep my composure.  Every time I've wanted to, I've backed away from it because I'd start to lose it.  But I knew I was at my limit and had to tell someone.  So I went and made some Valerian tea to knock my anxiety down a bit (for me this stuff seems to work on the fly but not long term) and went to tell my mother.  I completely lost it but glad I forced myself to do it. She said I should go see a doctor which we then made arrangements for then and there.  
  
The next day another friend of mine suggested I research some stuff on anxiety and depression in men since just learning about it would help me.  I did and wow, some of the stuff I read [was like reading a book on myself.](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/05/23/10-things-you-should-know-about-male-depression/) In a good majority of those points, I could see things in myself.  Especially the point about ""depression without sadness"" and also becoming more irritable rather than sad.  For the longest time I thought my problems weren't that severe because I wasn't sad, but now I know it's just because I'm responding the depression in a different way other than sadness.  
  
Anyway, back to my main point, I'm going to my general practitioner tomorrow and hopefully he can help me or refer me to someone else.

I almost broke down completely on the plane ride, could hardly eat at all for the two days I was there, and my anxiety made me shake it like a Polaroid constantly, in the immortal words of Mr. Andre 3000. 

Before I left on Friday, I was incredibly anxious. I needed to take an entrance exam, finish up financial aid paperwork, and get fitted for a chef's uniform all just an hour and a half after landing. It seemed so overwhelming and I really wasn't sure I'd be able to deal. But surprisingly, I was completely fine. 

Barely even a twinge of anxiety in the security line and in the crowded rush of people in the terminal. No horrible nausea or claustrophobia on the plane, and when I got up I didn't worry about my legs giving way beneath me. I made it through all the stuff I had to do at my school, smiling and talking naturally to everyone without stumbling around or feeling as though I was wearing a cheap mask. For once, I let myself be *really* happy without thinking about whether or not it's ""realistic"" to feel that way or if I ""deserve"" it. 

I've been on an SSRI (Lexapro) for about three and a half months now, and the difference has been like night and day. I was so afraid of getting on medication (what if there are horrible side effects? what if it destroys my personality? what if it makes my head fall off? blah blah blah), but I'm so glad I finally did. 

**Sorry for the wall of text, but I just wanted to let everyone on here know that even if you've tried a million things already, don't give up.

I was discussing how difficult I found it to come into college, how anxious and self-conscious I can feel just walking around busy parts of campus. I explained that I fear seeing people I know. It's hard to describe exactly why I feel so anxious about seeing people that I know. I have pretty much dropped out this year of college (something I've done for the second time now), and although I have really never said a word to ANYONE in my class, I see them all the time. I suppose I feel anxious about what they might think upon seeing me; ""where has he been"" or ""look at him weirdly wandering around by himself again"". It's hard to communicate via text why these might inspire such anxiety, but I do know that encountering certain members of my class does result in huge anxiety. 

That was part of why I had to drop out, just making my way in and out of and around college was such a draining experience. Whenever in there, I would hide away where I was sure noone would see me and waste time on the internet for hours and hours. When I explained that I found the encounter awkward, and the way that you strain to avoid eye contact with this person, even though you only know them to see, he identified that feeling as shame. It was weird to describe one of these encounters (of which I've had hundreds) as such a simple word. Before I've tried to describe them as socially awkward, embarassing, self-conscious. It's weird to see all of those things put in perspective simply by attaching the word ""shame"". And that was exactly it. There are so many aspects of my life of which I am ashamed. Since I've regressed back into this period of moderate social reclusion, I just spend time all day cringing in shame over nearly any past social encounter that I can think of. I'm ashamed of my former self, my dependence on my family, my lack social contact... it almost seems that If it is associated with me in any way, I am ashamed of it. 

I'm an incredibly self-conscious person with incredibly low self-esteem, and although I can put myself out there with an artificial facade of an interesting life, friends and mild confidence, it's just a thin veil covering a life of which I am nearly totally ashamed. I need to learn to change the way I feel about myself and my life to move forward.

I just thought I'd share this, when he mentioned it yesterday it seemed to put the source of nearly all my anxiety into a certain perspective.

Can anyone else relate?",DrDiv,51,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/snv98/i_dont_try_my_hardest_because_im_afraid_that_if_i/,"Hopefully this won't all come out as a jumbled rant, and hopefully someone can understand the same frustration that I do. This issue has been the main thing holding me back and also the cause of many depressive tendencies. 

A quick background history: I'm 21 years old, and have had anxiety for most of my life. It started getting really bad in my junior year of high school, and wasn't fully diagnosed until the beginning of my senior year. I ended up missing a ton of school because of it, and decided to take the noble route of dropping out and acquiring my GED through the local college instead of failing numerous classes, and taking my senior year over again. My anxiety would wax and wane, I would get massive panic attacks out of the blue, and anxious spells that could last a few days. During high school (and continuing after I left), I had a part time job at a local grocery store. There would be periods where I would miss a few days of work due to anxiety, and they didn't take too kindly to that. One week was particularly bad for me, and I ended up missing a ton of work. I started having panic attacks on the job as well and within a few days, I decided to quit. That was two years ago. 

It should be noted that I don't have health insurance, and so seeing a doctor was a matter of money. I saw a few here and there who would prescribe me small amounts of benzos to tide me over, but once those were gone there was nothing I could do. I sought a therapist for a while and did some CBT, but it never really took. 

During the last two years, my anxiety has gotten substantially better. I currently have a 30-pill supply of Ativan which I only use in emergencies (I've only had to take 2 halves in the last 3 months), and my panic attacks are becoming sparser and sparser, as well as less intense. However, there's a slight problem. During these last two years, I haven't really been doing much. I currently work from home doing freelance web design, I still live with my parents, I haven't stepped foot in a college yet, and most of my friends that I used to regularly see have moved away. 

However, I could have a better job, I could be in college, I could have my own place, and I could have a better social life if it wasn't for this damn feeling that I get. I have this extreme fear, this crippling thought process that if I put any time, money, or effort into something and it boosts me in a positive direction, my anxiety will come along and drag me back down to where I was (or worse). Everything that I've worked for, I've had taken away from me. My job, my school, various job and relationship opportunities, friends, meetups, hang outs, plans, all gone. I find fear in getting started with these things, because I'm absolutely afraid of failing. 

I want nothing more than to be in school right now, and working at a job that I enjoy. However I'm terrified that if I get everything together and paid for for school, I'll end up missing classes due to anxiety. Or what if I have a panic attack during a test? Then it'll all be for naught. Same with the job, what if I really enjoy it and it pays really well, but I end up a few months down the line having to quit because my anxiety is too much to bear? 

I know, this is a horribly irrational and destructive thought process, but I just can't shake it. Does anyone share this? Has anyone beaten this, or can give me even a shred of advice? I'd do anything to be in college by next fall, or at least take the first steps and see a guidance counselor for options of how to get in. Interviews with jobs would be awesome too.

Give them a try!",Dervinator,42,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1hxhyb/long_time_anxiety_sufferer_these_things_help_me/,"No, this isn't an attempt to sell you some herbal remedy that ends up making your testicles itch.

I have suffered, and I don't use that word lightly, from social anxiety since I can remember. Even being a kid I look back and I was nervous about sitting next to girls and making new friends, and the problem never really went away. 

I'm on track now though, and once you begin to notice the anxiety dissapate it's one of the best feelings you'll ever have. And it's possible, for every single one of you, it's achievable.

The most obvious first step is to go see your doctor. Nothing new, everyone will tell you this. It's hard but listen. Therapy is a fucking God send and some meds should help you tackle the physical symptoms so you don't sweat like a peadophile in a nursey every time the pressures on. It'll take time, a few months, but better that than be anxious for the rest of your life right?

Now, a couple of other things that will help. Meditation. It's not pseudo-scientific bullshit, it will help you turn the volume down on that negative inner voice that tells you to crap your pants when a girl smiles at you. Close your eyes and focus on different sounds you can hear for a minute each, then focus on your inner voice for 20 seconds or so. Differentiating between the two is the aim, so eventually your focus will remain on whats in front of you and you won't be hearing the voice that wants to panic. Try 15 minutes a day. Every day. This is like excercise, you won't wake up overnight with a six pack but you'll notice improvements over time. And then you'll want to do more!

Another tip is if you're nervous before a certain situation i.e. interview or presentation or anything, go to a private area where no one will bother you. For two minutes, make yourself as big as possible. Stretch arms, legs, look up, impose yourself on the space you're in. This sounds nuts yeah? So take some time today to watch a TED talk, only fifteen minutes, on 'fake it til you make it'. It sounds far fetched yes, but this really helped me, and if you believe it will help you then it will do the same for you too.

Can't imagine many of you got this far, but if you did, please at least consider what was written here. I'm still anxious, I still worry alone or in front of people, but I don't feel like anxiety dominates my life anymore. It's good to worry a bit, but don't let it stop you from doing what you want.

I keep getting asked these questions about why I'm taking it, whether I'm using it for the right reasons, and how many pills are left. I come to pick it up and the person at the counter sees a note and says the dreaded ""the pharmacist would like to talk to you first"". 

I have other prescriptions and never get these questions. It's a public place and it's incredibly stressful and embarrassing.

After stumbling upon this subreddit, I really want to share how I was able to get myself under control so that I could live normally again. I really feel for all of those who are struggling and want to help in any way I can. These are the three things that have helped me:
1. I first stumbled upon anxiety when I was 17. I had constant panic attacks, got no sleep, couldn't go to school, my life was falling apart. This stemmed from my friends thinking I would be crazy, the sudden panic of finding a perfect college and being forced to figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, moving away from home, and death. I had heard medications could help me but as a healthy, active 17 year old athlete, I hated the idea of medication. My mother had convinced me to talk to a doctor, that he wouldn't force me to do anything I didn't to do. This was my first step. I talked to the doctor and of course he suggested medicating me. Is this addictive? can I stop using it whenever I want? Is this going to affect me mentally? These were all the questions I had and they were answered; no, certain medications are not addictive, I can stop, and it won't do anything to me mentally besides halt my anxiety. He told me to try a sample, if I didn't like it, I could stop but just take it for three days. Three days later I felt great. A new person, waves of anxiety stopped, I could interact again.
2. Although my medication helped me with the sudden random panic attacks and constant anxious feeling, certain topics would still stress me out and flare my anxiety up. One of these topics was death: I had just put it in the back of my mind to deal with later but that only made it amplify. While in college I had to fulfill some core class requirements one of which was diversity. I took a religions class for this just because it sounded somewhat interesting (and I did get made fun of by some friends, but whatever, right?). I didn't meant to take anything from that class, but learning about buddhism, daoism, and others of the like, my entire perspective of life began to change. I took another class focusing on asian religions where we read books by these people (Diamond Sutre and Wandering the way most notable) and I was able to grasp a firm, spiritual control of myself and learned to control my body. This calmed me down greatly and I no longer have any concerns with death.
3. School still stressed me the hell out: I was a junior, trying to graduate in one of the hardest majors. I like free credits, we have physical activity courses that give you this so I thought what the hell, took yoga and pilates. I gained more from these than I thought possible; learning awareness of your body really helps you deal with stress. I personally enjoyed pilates more (it is very strong with breathing exercise and gives you the best ab workout ever) but they both dealt with the idea of your body being only yours. I learned many destressing techniques and it was a great release for end of day classes with midterm exams. I learned to control my heart rate, close my eyes, and just release my stress and live in the here and now when I get too stressed out. I do this when I feel a stress induced panic attack coming on. Buddhism texts may have helped me a bit with this, but I really realized myself through these silly classes and have been going strong ever since.
I did have full support from both of my parents this entire time and I never did have to see a psychologist for this. But I found my way through this difficulty and realize that living with anxiety isn't something I can just throw away, you have to learn to live with it and control it. Humans are facing far more stress in this new technological age (with having to stress about decisions for college, making decisions that effect the rest of your life, job ops, etc.) and we didn't all adapt to deal with this properly. Its nothing you need to feel too hindered by and remember there are always people trying to overcome it :) Don't feel afraid to ask for help!

I would like to note: Almost no one knows about my anxiety. I tell no one that I have a strong spiritual side (because that sounds a bit silly) and I never really encourage it unless someone has problems with anxiety. People know that I am a little athletic, but I have it so under control that people ask me ""Don't you ever get nervous in a large crowd like this? You are really outgoing"" I just smile :) I just didn't want to sound like a religious nut! ~",,False,,t5_2qmij,1360302578.0,,,True,t3_183k12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/183k12/i_am_someone_who_has_controlled_anxiety_this_is/,

1347285182.0,44,self.Anxiety,znhxv,How I completely rid myself of crippling anxiety.,buttcircus,46,2,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/znhxv/how_i_completely_rid_myself_of_crippling_anxiety/,"Hi!
 
Here is my backstory:
 
At around 15, I began to experience anxiety, mainly in social situations. Also, I got in a series of car wrecks that left me very anxious. Around this time I began seeing a therapist and a couple years later I began meds. But nothing helped that much.
 
The problem grew and by college I was avoiding people as much as possible. Eye contact was a nightmare. I wasn’t even comfortable looking at my family. Speaking in class was out of the question. And I would get anxious in cars and sometimes I'd just freak myself out while alone.
 
Well, from ages 15-30 I struggled terribly. I'm sure you're familiar with this story. It ruined my social life and my academic career. I couldn't hold a job. The few I had, I would sometimes have to hide in the bathroom, I’d perform tasks poorly, and ultimately I would just quit showing up. I would usually make up some convoluted excuse that I would leave on their answering machines, then never speak to them again.
 
Over these 15 years, I was on a total of 19 drugs. From Klonopin to Zoloft to Seroquel and Geodon. And saw nearly as many psychologists and psychiatrists. On more than one occasion I showed up at the ER, just wanting the anxiety and confusion to end. I’d get an MRI, which of course showed nothing, and other times I was given referrals to more Psychiatrists. Nothing worked. So, you get the idea.
 
Then, 16 months ago, I went through ""enlightenment"". It is silly useless word, but that's what people call it.
 
Here's how:
I downloaded the audio version of Eckhart Tolle's *The Power Of Now*.
I listened to it over and over again. Despite the occasional unappealing New Agey phrase (i.e., ""I have lived with several Zen masters, all of them cats. Or ""You are sitting on your own box of gold."" Oh, and he mentions Jesus (as a Zen master).  Jesus doesn’t freaking matter here, so hopefully that’s not too big of a distraction. Anyways, I knew that Tolle was pointing to a deep truth.
 
**So, here's basically the change required:**
 
**Learn to observe your mind**. For instance, think of your mother or job (or what/whoever). ""See"" with your mind the emotions and/or thoughts that are evoked by bringing you mother up. This “seeing” part of your brain is what we’re concerned with. 
 
Now stop thinking. And wait and see what the next thought will be to pop up in your brain.  It is *this* neurobehavior that you want to execute. Always be watching your thinking brain with your consciousness.  Try not to make any judgments or analyses, as those are themselves, thoughts.

After a while, it took about 6 weeks for me, you will come to the point where you can ""see"" every thought you make, and **you will be able to stop thinking whenever you want and for as long as you want**.
 
And here are two things that can help this process:
 
1. Realize deeply that it is literally always Now. This isn't meant to evoke a hippy attitude or make a philosophical statement; it's just an objective truth.
 
2. Feel your body as a whole from within. That may sound hippyish, but it has a grounding effect that keeps all of your attention from flying right up and into your head.
 
 
 
Tolle makes many metaphysical extrapolations from this shift in consciousness, but please don’t let that be a distraction for you. Your only responsibility in this is to adopt this neurobehavior I have described.
 
 
And so here’s what happened to me: I came out of my disorder 100%. Of course I can get apprehensive here and there, but that’s just human. And I’ve had some challenges to figure out along the way. But haven’t felt whole like this since I was a child. And socializing and working are no problem. I don’t take meds nor do I see a therapist. I won’t go on and on about my transformation, but hopefully this will help some of you, as I know very well the horrors of a mind out of control.

I followed the link and I turns out I somehow accidentally managed to like every single post on a thread on an anxiety forum about someone being afraid because they had a patch of dry skin on their leg and they suffered from hypochrondia.

I quickly unliked every post, but the damage was still done, that had been up for a whole month and I didn't know. I feel totally humiliated. If someone could help me feel better about this, I would be very thankful.

While fictional, I think this has a lot of parallels to what we face with anxiety disorders. For myself personally at least, I constantly worry about my anxiety. That's right: I worry about being worried.

How (objectively) ridiculous is that?

But I think the key is to understand and then accept that I'll likely have some amount of anxiety for the rest of my life, I'll probably always be bothered by X Y or Z trigger. But I can minimize its significance and thus its impact if I just accept these as things that happen in my life, just like any other routine event. 

So, like the Hulk, acceptance is at least half the battle.

Today I think I had an extra dose of bravery in my Cheerios because I decided to finally take the bus to go out. I was a bit anxious making sure I got off at the right stops but it was actually really easy and turned out to be fun too! I did get off at one of my stops too early but I only had to walk a tiny bit extra so it was no big deal. And going home will be just as easy. 

I just wanted to share this with a group of people who would understand and possibly encourage someone else to do something they've been a bit scared of too. It may turn out to be really fun like my experience! I met a cool guy and had some good conversations. :)

But an important little part of my story here was that I wasn't forced to do this. I didn't have to go out today. (I just wanted to go grab coffee since I've been sick and away from my favorite coffee place for too long.) Sometimes, our best victories are the ones we don't need to have. We just want to.

I beat it though! It happened, I didn't stop it, but I powered through.

My house looks amazing, and I managed to get through an attack alone. It feels like a big victory!

But seriously. Why do they just hit like that? There was not a single reason for it, at all. I was relaxed and happy. Now, I'm in that tired, kind of achy anxiety-hangover phase. I feel kind of depressed, kind of full of dread that I'll have another one.  Screw anxiety.

I'm meeting a friend soon but I really wanted to come back and give this message to you all.)

It's been awhile /r/Anxiety! I haven't been here in almost a month and a half. It seems that after someone gets through an anxiety problem, they obviously have no real reason to come here anymore, but I wanted to come back and make sure I tell you guys something.

 
To anyone suffering or potentially may suffer from ongoing &amp; debilitating panic/anxiety attacks (GAD), I cannot stress the importance of CBT, no self diagnosing on the internet (DO NOT google symptoms! EVER!) &amp; good sleep.

I'm a 24 year old female and I suffered for over a year &amp; a half of CONSTANT (no joke, morning, noon, night and even in sleep) worrying &amp; horrifying anxiety attacks for god knows why.. I still don't know why exactly they started happening to me, but they did and each time I was 100% sure something was wrong with me &amp; I was dying. It got REALLY annoying and really exhausting, I felt completely defeated by anxiety. I had to quit my job, and I lost all motivation, hope, and passion for life. I couldn't even drive places. Finally after having ENOUGH of caging myself into my own anxiety hole, I forced myself to start trying to get out. Basically, I said alright, if this is the only way I can get better or make any change, I'm going to let myself scare the shit out of myself, and just fucking keep trying no matter how many times I collapse, pass out or start ""dying.""

I forced myself to drive (even though it was horrifying for me each time) to CBT appts. and after several months of better sleep, therapy, no googling and mentally taking things one thing at a time, I finally feel in control again. I got through it with no medication (SSRIs) that may make you dependent &amp; sometimes have weird side effects. Some people need meds and that works perfect for them and all the power to them, but I made the choice to take the long road of no meds for my crutch (except for .1 milligrams of blood pressure medication to help me get better sleep) and finally I've been attack free for over a month now... which is incredible. I can't explain it. I'm no longer paralyzed with fear every day and I NEVER thought this would ever happen. I never thought I'd get out of it.

I don't worry hardly at all anymore. The only time I've felt anxious is one time I let myself ""mentally talk"" to myself about potential fears and symptoms and I caught on real quick. I got out of the ""anxious mind zone"", thought really hard about what I was doing and was able to talk myself out of it. I can't tell you enough how impossible that seemed for me before.. but CAN YOU BELIEVE IT, it IS FUCKING possible!! I'm able to live again!

I'm not saying I'll be anxiety free for the rest of my life, I know once you have a panic attack, you'll always be prone to having them again, but I don't feel helpless anymore. I'm getting my life back. I'm feeling good, I've been able to start making goals, I'm set on going back to school in spring, I even planned my classes out for the next 2 years and am seeking to move out if things keep going well! Another huge feat for me is that I drove 30 minutes, all by myself, in crazy traffic, and went to crazy downtown Seattle without having to pull over and phone my mom from hyperventilating and anxiousness. I NEVER thought I'd see the day!

Anyways, I just wanted to say things really do get better. I feel better.. and if I relapse, that's okay, because at least I feel better now and I know there's always hope to feel better again. All with a little bit of seeking help and change.

I love you all. Take care of yourselves. Breathe. Meditate. Eat things you enjoy. Watch movies you love. Laugh with people you care about. Start indulging and start finding small ways to feel like you're living again. DON'T LET YOURSELF FIND WAYS TO TALK YOURSELF OUT OF IT. Just do it.

**SO IMPORTANT: DON'T GOOGLE SYMPTOMS. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.. DO NOT. Even if you think it's real... JUST DON'T. Watch how fast those ""diseases"", ""heart problems"", ""tumors"", ""cancers"", and all those horrible things your scaring yourself with GO AWAY and no longer become relevant after you DON'T DO IT ANYMORE. ALL YOU'RE DOING IS FEEDING THE FIRE. If you want to google something wrong, just meditate.. talk to yourself. You're okay and you'll be okay, I promise. Please just try.**

There was this printed out note on the door that had this on it: due to an emergency maintenance had to enter your apartment. It had a place for a check box next to it. Which wasn't checked. It had placed for the guys name, why he entered. Nothing was filled out. So now I'm paranoid about why he entered. Is something wrong? Is my house clean enough? Are they going to kick me out for some reason? I'm still in panic mode. I have a bunch of clothes in bags I was going to give out for donation to the local women's shelter.

Our bedroom is going to be unusable again until the weather cools down. I don't know what to do. I was almost in tears talking to the maintenance guy.

The news causes a lot of anxiety for me personally. Not the intense anxiety, but just a general background level of elevated anxiety. I get nervous when I can't check it, and I get nervous when I see bad things happening. 

&gt;News is toxic to your body. It constantly triggers the limbic system. Panicky stories spur the release of cascades of glucocorticoid (cortisol). This deregulates your immune system and inhibits the release of growth hormones. In other words, your body finds itself in a state of chronic stress. High glucocorticoid levels cause impaired digestion, lack of growth (cell, hair, bone), nervousness and susceptibility to infections. The other potential side-effects include fear, aggression, tunnel-vision and desensitisation.

I thought we would try and start a program that pairs up people to be ""sponsors"" for each other. Either contacting this person via reddit, email, text, etc.. when you are feeling really bad or just need to talk.



I have awful anxiety about many things. Health issues is one. I have an extreme fear of vomiting (which is emetophobia). I also just have GAD. It can be sparked for no reason at all. 



Even if we are not always available for one another, sometimes just knowing someone else is listening is all you need. Instead of just Googling it and reading other peoples anxiety stories from '05. 



Edit: I have titled this project ""Just Breathe Reddit"". It will basically be a sponsorship program of sorts. I will create a newsletter and send it to everyone who has provided their info. This info will ONLY be used for the people who have allowed me to use them. This list is for everyone who needs a little help sometimes. Whether you are in the middle of a panic attack or not, you CAN help (and someone can help you!) You can help someone else by just listening to them and relating to them. It doesn't matter how big or small. We all have to be there for each other. Everyone MUST be kind and not dismissive. If you think you would be unable to counsel someone during a stressful time, please alert me of this, so I may make a note that you should not be contacted. 


Anyway, we got a good list going so far! I will send the email out by Friday. I will also keep the list updated as I get new people who are interested.  This is going to be great! We are not alone anymore.

as I pushed it farther and farther into the cushions,
as if the more I buried my head in the couch,
the farther away my world would be.

And I was thinking about ""The Plan,""
That white picket fence, 2.5 kids plan we all dream of,
the degree I was supposed to get,
the love I was supposed to find.
However, life hardly goes according to plan.

I let the anxiety flood over me and soon my whole body is shaking,
I couldn't slow down my racing heart,
stop the river of tears,
or let go of the phrase ""It isn't fair...""

And I was thinking about how unfair life was,
Dealing me cards I didn't even know were in the deck,
Throwing my plan to the wind,
and letting chance, and ultimately disappointment, take the reigns.

You were patiently listening to my latest mental collapse,
Unwavering, your care impresses me every time,
Never denying my reality,
Just assuring me I'm not alone.

And I was thinking about the promise I had,
Maybe I didn't have it,
maybe it was all a lie built by educators,
people unaware of the crazy just beneath the useless facts I could spit back to them.

""I want to be normal."" 
I sputtered out when my lungs would allow,
I hoped you knew what I meant,
I wanted to be the rock for you,
when the dark memories of yesterday took over your world,
I wanted to be the ground for you instead of the broken toy you were always fixing.

And I was thinking about how we've changed
How the roles we play for each other switched,
How I used to be your sunshine when you couldn't find your way,
I remember being sunshine,
but lately it seems as though the sun has set indefinitely.

""No one is babe."" 
My heart jumps,
I'm scared that this is all there is
My heart jumps,
You called me babe and it makes me happy for a brief second,
Knowing that you see me as I am,
as I want to be so desperately.

And I'm thinking about normality,
Is no one normal?
Do my neighbors, friends, family, coworkers, and enemies shake as night while a caring soul tries to soothe their hurt?
Is everyone one stitch away from becoming frayed?

""I'm sorry you have to deal with my craziness.""
And I am,
I wish I could hold myself together,
So that I wasn't running to you constantly with a life shattering problem,
that will be minuscule before dawn.

And I'm thinking about being messed up,
Why am I the way I am?
Genetics?
Did dear old Grandma give me this gift?
Is it repression?
Because I can't seem to recall anything worth this kind of distress.
And I realize I'm the worse kind of messed up,
The kind that has no reason.

""We're all a little crazy.""
That was the key of my lock tonight,
Soon I can feel my heart slow
my heaves slow
and eventually even my tears slow.

And I don't know what to say,
Thanks seems moot,
You know that I'm desperately thankful,
and I know you'll say ""That's what I'm here for,""
I decide to let it go,
And soon we're laughing again,
I guess that's just the way it is.

About moi: I have severe social anxiety, mild bi-polar disorder, ""pure O"" OCD, and I suffer from depression as well. 

For years, I have let them rule me. I have let them defeat me and steal my joy, rob me of my happiness - daily. Every new morning was a reminder that I was stuck in this cycle...this miserable hamster wheel...my biology having turned against me, making me a pathetic fool in a world full of folks who were living life...while I was losing mine to mental illness. So many days of my youth have been lost in suicidal abandon...sitting inside in the dark, wishing I had never existed, while my contemporaries ran in the sun, making love, earning prestige, and becoming champions in this world.

I tried pills. Prescriptions. They helped, to a degree, but often the cost was not worth the gain. I quit 'em cold turkey.

Since then, I've begun working out regularly. The benefit that regular exercise does for your mental well-being is impossible to under-emphasize. Jogging three times a week has done wonders for me.

There is a song that some of you older Redditors may recall. [Baz Luhrmann's ""Don't Forget To Wear Sunscreen""](http://youtu.be/sTJ7AzBIJoI). It was a novelty hit in the late Nineties. Played at graduations and such.

The line that I prize most from the song is this:

""Do one thing, every day, that *scares* you.""

I have taken this to heart. So each day, I endeavor to speak to that girl I'm too shy to introduce myself to. I work to say hi to that sad-looking stranger. I smile at a police officer, or I step out of my comfort zone in one of a million other ways.

So a few weeks ago, I got my server's permit and applied to work at a bar and grill.

I am naturally introverted. Making friends and being sociable is an effort for me. But I can do it. And the more I do it, the easier it becomes. Almost as if I'm coming out of my shell.

So I've decided to throw myself into the fire and see how I am forged.

There will be a few embarrassing weeks' worth of me forgetting customers' names, or misplacing orders, or being anxious and frightened when some burly trucker or an obnoxious dowager becomes irate with me because I brought their steak to them overcooked, or forgot to refill their iced tea in time.

But this awkward, painful purging of my introversion will be worth it.

For in a few months' time, I will no longer be afraid to walk up to that unbelievably gorgeous girl in the bookstore. Not ashamed of my appearance, or sabotaging myself with negative, self-effacing thoughts as I approach her. 

I will be able to meet someone who will love me. Someone I can give my whole heart to.

Why is any of this relevant?

I'm honestly not sure. But if I had to summarize, or venture a guess, I'd say this:

Fearing your demons gives them power. As soon as you have the balls to fight them head-on, you see them for what they are.

Temperatures have lingered around 103F during the day with between 50-60% humidity and not much relief at night.

One of my biggest triggers is when i feel like I can't breathe, so I figured it's  related to the combination of intense heat and humidity. The stuffy, thick air makes me feel a bit suffocated which can inspire a bit of an adrenaline rush and things sometimes snowball outward from there.

 I've been trying to expose myself to it as much as possible to get used to it and practice dealing with anxiety in uncomfortable situations, but I've had a few wicked panic attacks in the process. 

Does anyone else find themselves more susceptible during this kind of weather? If so, what is it that sets you off? Let's discuss.

NOTE: I am 22, male, and have been dealing with a panic disorder for about 4 years now. I've been through therapy and tried a few different drug combinations (Xanax only as needed has proven to be the most useful/least impairing), but I tend to prefer using breathing techniques and relaxation exercises to work through my panic symptoms. Also, From Panic to Power proved to be a useful book to me, but of you all have any other suggestions of books I would adore to hear them!

I am flaky towards my friends, and I avoid leaving my house unless it has to do with my girlfriend.

Anxiety has put a huge strain on my ability to retain relationships, and it has been adversely affecting my friendships and my girlfriend for a while now.

I have a friend who I hardly get to see anymore. We were close in high school, but since college started, we see each other maybe 8 times in the year. I also have a history of being flaky with him (like I do with all my friends). Last night, this friend asked me to join him and his girlfriend at a bar that supposedly doesn't card (I am not 21 yet). The thought of getting caught bothered me. I asked him if he was sure I could get in, to which he said ""85 percent sure, but worst case is we go elsewhere with some rum in my bag"". Now, normally this would make me feel better, but I began to worry that I would have to get in their car and drive somewhere far away. Transportation has been hard for me lately, I only feel really comfortable when I am driving, and when it is a short distance.

After spending an hour and a half of giving him flaky answers and kind of deflecting questions on whether I would meet up with him, I decided I should be honest with him about what I was feeling. He knows I suffer from anxiety, but I am sure he knew little about what how it effects me. I simply texted him a long response stating essentially, ""I want you to know that I am not going to come out tonight. The reason is that tonight I am experiencing a lot of anxiety, and getting out of the house is too much for me to handle right now. I don't normally explain this to people when I don't go through with plans, but I wanted to tell you so that you don't take it personally. In fact the only reason I have been indirect for the last hour and a half is because I have been trying to conjure up the mental state needed to get up and out of the house to see you. I don't talk about my anxiety much, but if you have any questions you can ask any time.""

Now this felt really good. I think that being honest with people around you forces you to be honest with yourself. I felt a little down on myself for ""giving in"" to my anxiety by not going out, but I wasn't going to pretend that I didn't have anxiety and I was going to own up to it and talk about it shamelessly.

He responded saying, ""Thank you for telling me. Would you prefer to be alone? Because I would love to come over and hang out with you.""

I said, ""Yes! That sounds like a great idea. Are you sure that's okay?

To which he said, ""You underestimate the love I have for you"".

That was pretty powerful, even if the love part was tongue-in-cheek on his part. I never share my anxiety with my friends, only my parents and girlfriend, but this really felt good.

He came over with his girlfriend and a few more of my friends and we had a great night all together. It was made possible by my communication of how I was feeling, which opened up other options for us to all have a good night.

Instead of sulking all night about how I wasn't good enough or normal enough to get out of my house and join my friends, they came to me and made me forget about all of it.

I know I am lucky now to be surrounded by compassionate people. I know that some people don't have this fortune, including possibly some of you reading this. But I advise those of you who do have people to talk to you, even people who might not understand (like my friend), to talk about your anxiety and make compromises with yourself and keep pushing yourself a little bit every day.

I will end this with a little bit of /r/Fitness wisdom- we're all gonna make it.

Today I tried to eat crackers and was afraid of dying. So I drank broth made from a bouillon cube. Let's be honest, I probably felt like I was dying because I got NO sleep last night and because of the stress of being trapped in my own mind and because I hadn't eaten anything. 

My aunt died in May. It started that night. I felt my heart do ""something"". I was gearing up to take on my personal white whale - a fucking chemistry class. After all the failing and fighting and insulting and sadness of my childhood, I was just so terrified of getting back into one of my problem classes. 

I flashed back to the anger and disappointment on my mother's face and the smug pout as she quipped about being someone's maid. Since that's all I could possibly do. Getting cleaning supplies for Christmas... ugh. We didn't KNOW about my learning disability. Why would we check? I was considered ""above average"". I didn't know WHY I couldn't live up to ""above average"".

It's been a little over two months since the descent started. I think I'm dying every day. I love to paint my nails (I am/was an avid laquerista) but I cut them off so I can better document how healthy they look. I am checking my lymph nodes and they ARE a little sore, but it MIGHT be because I'm fucking poking them all the time! I spend an unreasonable amount of time with my hand on my heart. I'm not super patriotic, I'm making sure it's beating right. I have to stop myself from running to the blood pressure cuff every time I'm near a pharmacy. Sometimes I want to check it more than once. Let's be perfectly honest, my heart could very well be having abnormal palpitations, but it's probably from the stress of worrying about it.

I'm so so worried that I'm driving my fucking glorious husband insane. He says I'm not. I can't believe him. He says the stereotypical, ""You need to shrug it off/get over it."" I can't EVEN be upset because there's a tiny person inside my brain that is SCREAMING at me to get over it! The me that people are used to; who fights so hard to take back control from... whatever this thing is. That said, I've already decided that if I am dying I'm going to leave him. We're still young. he can find a nice girl who will live a long life instead of taking care of my while I die. I really really wish I could stop thinking about that every day.

I miss the days of pulling out my hair, intrusive thoughts, and repetitive stress dreams. I thought that was bad! I would trade all of my eyelashes and brows to beat this. I've had panic attacks before, but not multiple times a week. Not when I'm home alone and it SEEMS like I should be able to relax. I've never sat in a doctor's office and cried, ""Is it my heart!?"" No, it's the stress induced muscular tension. I feel totally encased in chaos. Fuck this pressure in my chest.

I passed chemistry. Something I never thought I'd do. I thought I would be able to take control back from myself. I took care of some of the back pain, apparently it's going to be a process. I still feel utter despair. I'm going to ruin my life. I'm going to ruin my beautiful marriage. I HAVE to get this under control. I just don't know what to do. My god what's wrong with me!?

I'm sorry that none of this makes sense. I sat down and I wrote it because I feel like I'm about to explode. Today I thought that maybe being dead was better than reverting my to my childhood. I can't say I'm suicidal. I mean, I wouldn't kill myself, but it seems like a fantasy.

(Xpost r/relationship_advice),VintagaGirl,43,5,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1fv75c/relationship_anxiety_i_cant_stop_worrying_about/,"(For the record, I'm not diagnosed with GAD or anything but anxiety disorders definitely run in my family. I've been talking with a therapist for months.)  
I (19f) have a fantastic boyfriend (21m) who would do anything for me, loves me, even thinks I'm somewhat cute when I go all neurotic on him (he says I'm sweet-crazy!). We've been together two months and everything is perfect.  
We had a talk yesterday, when he made a joke of being single again, about our potential breakup and he said what I was feeling: Considering our ages, chances are we will break up at some point but we hope to be together for a long time, and if that ends up being forever then that's great. This, logically, is exactly how I feel about the situation, and the fact that he agrees completely couldn't be more amazing.  
Unfortunately I've had a string of bad relationships in the past that have all included the guy getting tired of me and leaving me for someone else/becoming unattracted to me. Needless to say, since these are my only other relationship experiences, this pattern is somewhat ingrained in my head and, now that we've talked about our potential breakup, I feel like a switch has been flipped and now I can't enjoy the relationship **now** because I'm hyperaware of the breakup. He didn't write back for a few hours? He's getting tired of me.  I already want to hide the things that he's got at my house so I don't think of him if we do break up. My head is in perpetual what-if mode, a very dangerous place for me to be.   
I realize I can't control the future and should just be here now, because we're young and in love, but my anxiety doesn't realize that and  
won't  
SHUT  
**UP.**  
If anyone has any advice as to how I can chill my brain out, I thank you in advance. I just want consistency. I'm tired of heartbreak.  
**TL;DR:** I have the perfect relationship right now but the realization that we will probably break up is ruining it for me. Curse you, Say Yes To The Dress and adorable old people who have been married to their high-school sweethearts.

Usually when I wake up my alarms are blaring and I freak out.  I'll roll out of bed turn off both alarms with a snooze button and go back to sleep.

Naturally waking up for me however was a complete fluke.  I'm in college and don't get the amount of sleep that I typically need most times so I have to rely on some sort of system that wakes me up.

By ""innocent"" I mean he was trying to be friendly/flirty, not perverted/insulting. It should have been nothing. It should have meant nothing. But as I walked back to the kitchen to place his table's order I suddenly found myself out of breath. In a bad way.

I felt my pulse and it was hammering like crazy. I started to get dizzy. But as my therapist always says ""Fight it and remain calm"". So I placed the order and pretended everything was okay. I started to think about this one book I'm reading, trying to calm myself that way and separate my mind you know? But then I heard, or think I heard, another customer say ""Let's be nice to her.. all tits and no brains, not her fault"".

Turns out the runner to that table brought out the wrong flavored wings (it's not her fault, she's new and still learning the table numbers). I apologized but I felt myself sweating. This one guy, probably in his early 20's I'd guess who might have been the one to make the earlier comment, smiled at me and said I should relax. I was obviously sweating. For a brief moment I started to take his advice due to his kind words but then he suddenly grabbed my butt as I turned to go back to the kitchen to fix their order.

That's when I totally lost it. I had a full blown attack right there in the middle of the bar room. 

I couldn't breathe at all. I grasped at my neck and dropped my pad and fell to my knees. Everything was spinning. I was so scared. I didn't lose consciousness but I kept thinking I would as one of the AMs and another waitress tried to help me up. The waitress, by the way, tugged at my shirt though I didn't realize it at the time.

Later I found out that the shirt was torn. I'd been clawing at it so much during my attack that I exposed most of my bra by tearing at the well washed top.

After I finally calmed down the AM told me I should go home. But he wouldn't let me drive. He doesn't know that I'm in treatment for anxiety disorder or anything like that and I'm worried he thinks I was on drugs or something. But I wasn't. I honestly wasn't. 

Things have been rough for me lately and my psychiatrist has been weaning me off of klonopin b/c she doesn't think it's been helping and she wants to try something else (I don't know what).

*Take your Implausible folder and delete it and, this is important, take your plausible folder and hide it in your imaginary Documents file.

I quoted that purposefully, because ""thoughts"" are the key to many (if not the vast majority of) people's anxiety.  Over the past 50 years or so, researchers have discovered connections between feelings/emotions, healthy and unhealthy, and thoughts.   People with feelings of anxiety, depression, anger, etc. had similar types of thoughts.  

So researchers tried something pretty novel - they said ""fuck asking a person about mom and dad, let's see if we can directly challenge a person's thoughts and see if that affects feelings/emotions.""  

Here's what they found: 

People with feelings of anxiety, fear, and panic, nearly always have thoughts that they are in danger, and it can be any kind at all; danger of losing social status, being rejected, being physically harmed, having an illness, losing a job, dying, or even danger of becoming anxious (fear of fear).  Your mind creates the danger, whether it actually exists or not, and it is unable to distinguish between real danger and imagined or perceived danger.  The physical reaction you have is identical when you have mere 'thoughts' of danger as it is to the reaction if an actual lion were standing before you ready to chomp. 

Interestingly, people with feelings of sadness, helplessness, and depression nearly always have thoughts that they have lost something irretrievably, while feelings of anger are connected with thoughts that things are not as they ""should"" be, according to your idea, and that things ""should"" be different. 

Researchers then discovered that people with unhealthy levels of sadness, anxiety, guilt, shame, anger, etc. all seemed to have **irrational, unsupported, untrue, and otherwise illogical** thoughts of the types I just mentioned.  For example, an anxious person had thoughts of something dangers, and those thoughts were irrational, illogical, and sometimes really off-the-wall with no basis in reality.  

So the researchers set out to help people **identify their thoughts, challenge them, and modify them.**

Here's a neat example of how thoughts, whether empirically true or not, can have monumental impacts on your emotions: 

*Your coworker calls to tell you that the lottery ticket you bought is the winner - $200 million, divided among 5 people.  You're ecstatic, your mind racing with thoughts of paying off debt, helping others, taking relaxing vacations, and buying that coveted Reddit-monogrammed leather miniskirt you always admired.  But your coworker got it wrong.  She looked at last week's winning numbers, and this week, you didn't win.*

Objectively, you were never a millionaire.  You won nothing.  But the ""thought"" of it, without having a single dollar in your hands, without paying off any debt or taking any vacations, made you happy.  There was no connection between truth and reality and your thoughts and connected emotions. 

Here's an example of how anxiety tends to work: 

*You are going to a party, and you just **know** you're going to say something stupid to someone, and everyone will laugh at you and talk about you for years.  You may even become so embarrassed that your name is forever linked with social-failure, the old ""Munson"" syndrome.*

This thought is completely illogical and irrational, yet your body physiologically reacts as if you actually, truly are in danger of losing respect, being vilified, and having people look down upon you for eternity.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy teaches people to identify their feelings and emotions, search for the ""thoughts,"" and then challenge those thoughts using various methods.  These methods include: 

* directly analyzing the truth/falsity of your thoughts by writing them and reviewing them
* challenging the truth/falsity by doing something, like actually going to the party and seeing if you end up universally vilified forever
* digging into the foundation for the thoughts, by searching for underlying fears and concerns and then challenging those. 


I thought I'd share this with all, because I spent years working on anxiety before researching CBT and reading books about it, and it can change your life.

The problem is that I have to quit this other job without giving 2 weeks notice. They owe me about $150. I am terrified.

Therefore I'd like to share this with you all. A little background first.

My story begins in a land known to many of you, the land of social anxiety. Some 6 years ago (I was 16 at the time) I moved from my quiet little place with a lot of friends, even had some girlfriends (I was a cute kid), to this horrible land. Gradually it got worse, and while I was still in high school, all my friends went off to college and I was left behind, not really capable of making real friends. A year later I myself went to college, moving away and starting a life of my own. The first year was hell. I didn't go to classes, didn't make any exams, I don't even remember how I got through the day really. It was the blackest year in my whole life. I remember one time, I invited someone I knew from high school to my appartment, but once she was there, I had to send her away, because I felt like shit. I never spoke to her since, and I don't think I ever will... But that's a whole other story.

During that year, I started going to the university's therapist. But that didn't help at all, so she sent me to the city's mental health institution (ggz) and I started therapy away from school, just before the summer holidays. We spent all summer preparing for the new year, and during that time, I had a sort of epiphany. I was determined to start the year well, at all cost. 

So I met with a psychiatrist and we agreed that I would go all out on my medication the first few weeks (I was on 40mg citalopram, which was raised to 60, and I would take 0.5mg xanax every day). That was, looking back on it, probably one of the greatest weeks of my life. I was so proud of what I did. A new environment, new people, classes, I had it all. 

But of course, it didn't end there. that was 2 years ago now, and I'm still fighting. It did help me get over that one hurdle, and now I'm improving my social skills. I'll never fully get rid of the anxiety, but I can remove it from my daily life. Only when I do something different, I get anxious.

Ending on a high note from last week. For the first time in my life, I asked a girl out on a date. It was one of the toughest things I ever did. Unfortunately, she said no, but that didn't stop me from feeling very proud of myself.

Anyway, I'm sorry for the rambling, it felt great writing this and I couldn't stop. I don't really care if anyone reads this, I feel great now. ",,False,,t5_2qmij,False,,,True,t3_x8pzx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/x8pzx/as_requested_beating_the_anxiety/,

I thought I would share.,SenatorStuartSmalley,42,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/tzjkw/came_up_with_this_analogy_for_my_panic_attacks_i/,"A little background to why I thought this up.  When I was younger (maybe 10/11) My dad had a golden retriever.  We would bring her for walks to the park.  One time I wanted to hold the leash.  Since these walks were uneventful, he let me.  Well, she saw another dog and started running.  I didn't have the sense to let go and she dragged me over some dirt and gravel.  It stung a little, but it wasn't anything too serious.  

-----

My analogy:
Having a panic attack is like being dragged by an out of control dog.  You are just along for the ride and get dragged through whatever it wants to run through.

Lately, I've been better at aborting attacks.  It's like I have control of the leash. 

My conclusion:
I will never have control of the dog.  It's not possible to have complete control of another sentient being.  However, I can make sure the dog doesn't go beyond the reach of my leash.  Hopefully I won't be dragged through the gravel, though.

I don't feel that it's fair to him that I rely on him for social interaction (aside from Reddit).  
Mind you, that he doesn't like to be around people either, but he's forced to because he's in the Army.    

I had friends in grade school, until I graduated high school.  
I pushed everyone away and became a recluse, allowing myself to become addicted to the Internet.  
I replaced local friends with online ones (people from MMOs and chat rooms), and made numerous friendships that I thought would last.  
I was very satisfied with online friendships, because I didn't have to deal with face-to-face contact. However, years ago, my anxiety reached a point where I became afraid to interact socially on the web and lost all of those friendships.  
Many of the friendships also died because we all grew up and didn't have time to chat so often. I guess I was the only one who didn't grow up since I can't even leave the house.    

I'm ashamed to rekindle any of them, and fear that too much time has passed.    

My husband has to go away for 3-4 months starting June, and I will be faced with the responsibility of going out and getting things done, which I'm extremely terrified of doing.  
I was able to do all of that when he was in basic training, but I had a vehicle then. Now I live in a place across the country from family and I have no vehicle (we have one that is a stick shift, but I don't know how to drive it). I'll have to take cabs (which is extremely expensive) or ride the bus.       

Can anyone relate to this? Am I just a freaking loser that needs to suck it up? I don't know how else to be. I'm even afraid to go to the doctor to try to get help.  
I pondered if medical marijuana could help me, but I'm too chickenshit to ask my doctor about it. I figured he would look down on me for even asking and think I just wanted to get high. Mind you, I've tried drugs before, but I don't do anything now, and don't want to.  
I've tried anxiety medications, but they only worked for a month or so and required me to take a higher dosage. By the time the meds ran out, I was anxious again and afraid to go to the doctor.    

alksjdflakjsdflkjasdf  
How do you cope? How do you deal? What if you were alone and had no one to talk to?  
I feel like you're going to say ""Get out of the house, even for a little bit a day."" I've done that. I try to get out about twice a week and sit at the park and read. Whenever I try to talk to someone, or someone engages conversation with me, I never know what to say, and stumble through my words, saying the wrong things, or taking to long to think of a response.  
I've tried many things, and always fall back into the same rut.  
The main problem is not having support. That's my problem, and it's my fault for being this way.

I have to write out exactly what I'm going to say beforehand, and even then it sometimes puts me in tears and usually means I'm just not up for dealing with people at all for the rest of the day.

Needless to say, this puts me in a pretty shitty position for getting any sort of treatment, since finding a doctor involves lots of phone calls.

But my anxiety is getting worse, and it's gotten to the point where it's prevented me from doing important things like going to the dentist and getting medical care for semi-serious injuries, and a few times in the last couple of months, I've been close to not being able to convince myself to leave the house for work.

In the days before I was due to collect my letter were awful, I didn't sleep, I felt sick all the time and that very familiar sinking feeling in my stomach when I thought about results day. When they handed my letter over and I rang my girlfriend to tell her, I couldn't breathe but this time it wasn't due to panic attack.
Now its all over! I wish I could say that my years in uni were amazing and I made loads of friends but they weren't and I didn't. Honestly I'm just so glad its over. I didn't realise how much it was affecting me and how much of my anxiety was being caused by uni until the end of my second year. I feel like the weight of the world has been lifted, not completely but I feel like I can breathe again and the intense guilt and feelings of worthlessness are gone.   
I have a job and I'm moving into an amazing house with my girlfriend and our cats and it all looks pretty good right now.

I am new to this sub, so I hope I'm not doing this wrong. I am currently not experiencing much (if any) anxiety, and I hope it stays this way! I came here as I wanted to share my story, and maybe give some people hope/advice. So here goes nothing:

First of all, when at it's worst, I had truly crippling anxiety; I laid on my sofa day in and day out, even slept on it. I couldn't even go in to the kitchen, I rarely ate, I even got anxiety by watching the darn TV. I could not enjoy anything and my life was living hell, I was just waiting for something better to come along I guess. Panic attacks happened once or twice a day, and I always felt some level of high anxiety. Going outside or going in the shower was WAY out of my comfortzone and never/rarely happened.

So what happened that left me here? It's a long story but I'll try to keep it short -- When I was 17-21 years old I did a lot of drugs, took no responsibilities, and it ended up costing me my home and job and basically all my friends. These years are still a big dark messy cloud to me, I can only remember very few things, things which were all bad and filled with paranoia, violence and ""bad company"". After my mother moved back to town, she let me move back in, this was basically the turning point of my life, and everything there on after has been going really fast. 

So I decided fuck it, I'm going to stop taking drugs and pull my shit together. Said and done, I had met a girl, got clean, got an apartment, got a kid, got a job. Things had turned out GREAT. I got this job as a system developer, a very mentally demanding job, and the amount of responsibilities and pressure I had on me was very big, especially with the kid at home. From this moment, and 6 months on, my days basically looked like;


 * 7 AM - Get up, go to work.

 * 18 PM - Come home, eat dinner, take care of kid

 * 20 PM  - 02 AM - Kid is asleep: Freetime, fuck yes!

 * 5 AM - Go to sleep, sleep 2 hours at best.

 * Repeat


6 months later, I hit the wall. I was burned out. Going from nothing to everything in that short of time fried my brain out good. I remember the tipping point, It was an early sunday morning, I was fudging about on the computer and drinking a lot of coffee. 3 huge cups on an empty stomach. Suddenly, out of nowhere, everything was moving REALLY fast, I was sweating like a pig, thought I had a heartattack. It was in fact my first panic attack out of a LOT of them.

So. This point in time + 6 months, I'm doing what I first described, Laying in the couch, waiting for the agony to end. I slept so friggin much these months, dreamt the weirdest shit. My fiancee took care of both our daughter and me during this time, the angel that she is.  Anxiety aside, the effects of my mental burnout was severe, I could barely think, speak, or do logical thinking. I had a hard time opening a car door.

The time passed, I got more and more energy, started feeling more normal in my cognitive abilities again. The anxiety remained though. Now I at least had the energy to do something about it, so I did!  It started with baby steps, taking long showers and ignoring the panic attacks, futile as they were (in the long run). Just tried to enjoy myself. Few weeks later I had successfully went out to go shopping at my local small market! The anxiety was killing me but I had done it! SUCCESS!

Months went by, and just recently it really have started disappearing completely! I can go out to eat, go to them big malls/stores that are crowded with people and not give a fuck again! I feel so free again! :)

I am still not 100% recovered, but it's getting there! My tricks was rather simple actually:

* For panic attacks; Breath slowly, try not to think to fast, as it often just makes it worst. When you get some sort of grip in your brain, just keep telling yourself: There is NO real danger. What I'm feeling is simply stupid remains of our caveliving, cheetah-fighting times when these things was neccessary. I am as safe as can be.  Etc.

* For general anxiety; Set up goals, ignore your anxiety and widen your comfortzone at least once a week. As long as you can think to yourself; I have done progress, you will get more progress done. Never loose hope! Babysteps are great. Start small. Conquer the tiniest stones, use that motivation and soon you're standing on top of mount everest screaming your lungs off! (By euphoria, not anxiety).

NEVER be scared to face your fears! They are nothing but fears, then can not harm you in any way! They are cowards who simply run away when you confront them for about 10-15 minutes. Fears exist because you let them control you. 

Also; If you are feeling anxiety anyway, it doesnt really matter where and under what circumstances you are feeling them, right? 

Have a splendid evening, sorry for a huge post, and dont be afraid to ask me anything!

The social anxiety has gotten better over the last few years, but I still have some difficulties, specifically with hyper-awareness and automatic thoughts. 

I've gotten better about putting myself out there when I want to be around people, but a lot of the time when I am with a group of friends, I feel like the black sheep; the one who isn't acknowledged as much as others, the one who feels left out of the inside jokes, you get my point. Last night was different, though. 

I live outside of DC, so after work, I went into DC with two of my friends to play trivia. Generally, with these two friends, it's easy for me to feel like a third wheel and withdraw from them because they have gotten closer in the last several months. Instead of withdrawing though, I faked it until I made myself feel like I was as included as I desired to be. While playing trivia, I felt like an integral part of the team and not just the tag-along. When we were all taking the metro back home, I noticed that my two friends were speaking to each other more than speaking to me; and while I noticed this and felt that certain discomfort I get when my anxiety is flaring, I was okay because for that moment *I didn't care*. I can't tell you the last time I found myself in a situation like that and just brushed it off. It was so incredible to just not care.

So when I finally got home with my roommate, I felt so light. I felt so engaging. I felt like *myself*. When my boyfriend came to stay with me at night, I didn't feel like I was holding back from him (I've been doing that lately because I've been having some pretty heavy anxiety for the last month). I just talked and held him and laughed with him, and it was the first time I felt that good around anyone in a what feels like ages. 

It was honestly the most beautiful feeling I've felt in so long, and for once, I fully believed that I can actually take back control. This comes on top of me deciding to find some new hobbies to engage myself with, to go back to therapy to work on my coping skills, and to find a psychiatrist to see if I can get back on Celexa to help with my improvement. 

Still, it felt so incredible to not feel anxious, to not feel tense, and to not feel like something bad is going to happen and that I was the cause of it. I just wanted to document this so I wouldn't forget that moment and that feeling.

The problem I have is with regular customers. When someone becomes a regular at my store, when I see them over and over again, the more anxious I become. Dealing with these people who I see relatively often makes my heart race and causes me to become lightheaded and shaky. 

It is the same with friends, unless they are someone I see all the time, then I get really anxious even seeing them, and that makes it hard for me to talk to them.

When I start to become anxious, my muscles tense up, sudden pain can happen, one thing leads to another, and I will think I am dying and things get worse and worse.

Try this:,zastels,35,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1a2n47/do_you_have_anxiety_this_very_moment_try_this/,"I do this to help myself, and since then I have had great control over my ability to kill anxiety when it comes up.

Go into a room with a reasonable amount of space to walk. Take a deep breath, place one foot in front of the other, heel to toe. Say out loud (preferable) or in your head, right foot, left foot, ect.

Every step with your right foot, say right foot. Every step with your left foot, say left foot. Once you get the hang of it, also incorporate inhaling and exhaling into your monologue. 

Inhale, right foot, exhale, left foot. 

Now do the same thing, except walk backwards. 

Here is what you're going to learn from this and why it will help you. Every single time you lose your balance or falter in any way, take note of how your imagination was running wild. Every time you misstep, it is because you have lost concentration from the present moment, and have begun thinking.

Do this for about 25 minutes, and notice how quickly you improve in your balance. Your balance will improve from your mind gaining clarity. Pay special attention to how out of control your thinking process has become, and learn to safeguard your mind from the static noise of thinking. 

Happiness exist only in this very moment, not past or future. This exercise will help you return to the present moment where you can feel calm and happy. 

Tips: Take one footstep for each inhale, and one footstep for each exhale. Walk and breath slowly, for it will challenge you greatly. Put your awareness into only your breathing and each foot you are using. Focus on your inhale and how your lungs fill with air and become full, and then how wonderful it feels to exhale, and that moment in time between the inhale and exhale. Every time you catch yourself thinking, stop. Continue the exercise.

Once you have finished this exercise, you can test yourself easily to gauge improvement. Say to yourself out loud with your eyes closed ""I wonder what my next thought is going to be."" Put all your attention and energy into identifying what your next thought will be. 

The time between when you say this, and when you have a thought, is called presence. The more you practice, the longer your presence will last. 

Anxiety cannot exist in the present moment. Free yourself by getting here.

I've just been lucky enough to have a few good doctors (and many bad). If I'm wrong, please correct me. I don't have any sources for this, this is all in my head since I learned it. I do not speak perfect english since I'm swedish, so corrections are welcomed but try not being to harsh.**

**1. Chest pain**

When you work out too much, what happens? Your muscles gets tired - everyone knows this. Nothing strange about that one. So if you for example trains your bicep, and it gets tired - it will tell you to not use it anymore by hurting. Everyone knows this aswell. So what do you do? Do you keep using it? No, you will probably try to not use it until the pain has gone.

Same things goes with all your muscles. The muscles around your lungs and below are supposed to be used for moving the lungs when breathing. **The little tiny muscles between your ribs and collarbones are *not***. They are supposed to help moving your arms and neck. 

So what happens when you get nervous/anxious? You start breathing with tiny movements and move your ribs instead of your stomage. You will breath ""too high up"", or what to call it in english. So instead of using these big and strong muscles that's below your lungs, you use these tiny and weak muscles around your ribs and collarbones that are supposed to only support the neck/arm movements.

When these muscles get tired, they will try to tell you this by starting to hurt. But since you can't just stop breathing, they will continue to hurt. And you will continue to breath. This will make your muscles more and more tired. And what does tired muscles do? They contract. And do you know what happens when *one* muscle starts to contract? It will automatically pull the edges of the muscle next to it (since all muscles are connected like chains), and the muscle next to it will answer by pulling back.

So when it feels like *""something is wrapped around your ribs""*, it's not just a feeling - it actually **is** something wrapped around them. Your own muscles are actually wrapped around your chest.

**2. Digestive problems**

When you suffering from anxiety you might get a hard time at the toilet, you might have diarrhea, or you might have a hard time to ""do your business"". All this comes from the same problem as the chest pain - you don't breath right. Instead of using the big strong muscles around and below your lungs, you breath with tiny and fast breaths at the chest. When you do this, you don't use your diaphragm. The diaphragm is the big muscle located right under you lungs. This muscle is the one that SHOULD be used when breathing, and it has more purposes then that. The diaphragm is located right over your intestines, so every time you move it - it will massage your intestines, and your guts actually depends on this massage to function properly.

So your diarrhea is actually a result of intestines that gets too little attention from the rest of the body. I know it's hard to breath properly the whole day, even for someone not suffering from anxiety, but try to do it just for a while, maybe 15 minutes at the end of the day. It will help.

Also eating more fiber is good, since this helps with the ""intestine-massage"".

**3. Head ache**

Again, if we move back to what I wrote in the first part. When you breathe inproperly, you use the muscles around your collarbones. When these muscles get tired, they will pull them self together, and also start pulling in the muscle next to them. This will start a chainreaction of different muscles pulling each other.

This leads to that the more tired the first muscle gets, the more it pulls, and the more tired the second muscle get, and the more *that* muscle pulls. 

Outside of your head bone, you probably like most of the people think it's just skin, but actually there is a large but flat muscle on each side of your head (as big as your hand, I think). You can probably not feel it, and I'm sorry but I have forgotten this muscles name, but I think it begins with A.

When the muscles in your neck gets tired, they will eventually pull this muscle. So when it feels like there's something wrapped around your head and giving a pressure, again - there actually *is* something wrapped around your head. There actually *is* something that gives a pressure around your head. Your own muscles, once again.

When you notice this, remember to try to breath correctly. To help the pain ease, massage helps. Just put your fingertips at the sides of your head and move them around in little circles. Also an ordinary neck massage helps a lot.

**Other reasons for head ache**

Another of the most common reasons for head ache is that you just haven't been drinking enough. Remember, your body is supposed to always be a *liiiiiittle* bit thirsty - **when you stop being thirst, it means that you are dehydrated**. There is some scientific reason behind this but I won't get into that now. However, if you haven't learned it yet learn it now. When you notice that ""Hey, I haven't drank anything in 7 hours and I'm not the least thirsty"" - it means that you already is dehydrated. So drink, drink, drink!

(*Just don't drink **too** much, that will just destroy your organs. When they say 3 liters a day, that means 3 liters **including** the water you get through your food.**)

Also it can be from staring at a computer/tv for far to long. For your eyes and your brains sake, look away from the screen for 30-60 seconds  (more is great but that's enough, and I'm sure even the WoWplayers can get 30 seconds left over sometimes) once in a while, preferly every 30th minute but do it just as often as you can.

**4. Unbalance**

Many times when you feel unbalanced it's just as simple as the fact that your feet don't have any connection to the ground. But down your feet to the floor (this works best if you don't wear shoes, and especially on a carpet, grass, stones or any other patterned area) and start feeling with your toes on the ground. By this, you will tell your body that ""it's safe here""'.

Even if you feel safe in a place, when your body don't have any ground connection anymore if will automatically feel unsecured. This is a natural instinct.

Also, you might need more blood in your hands and feet. Buy a [massageball](http://resources.sport-tiedje.com/bilder/kettler/massageball_set_detail.jpg) and either place it on the ground and roll your foot over it, or place it in your hand and just roll it around between your palms. You can use it for many other things, many more advanced, but this simple thing is all you need to do.

*Pro tip: Massageballs are often expensive, but you can often find dog toys that are really cheap that looks just the same! (Everything that looks the same as them, works the same. It's nothing special with the balls that are sold for massage*

**Other ways to trick your brain**

Remember this - everything your brain get as information, is real to it. The brain doesn't seperate fiction from fact. That's why you get scared when you watch a scary movie, becuase even if *you* know it's not for real, your brain thinks that there actually is a murder infront of you.

So when you think ""maybe I fuck this up"", ""maybe i'll die"", ""maybe someone will kill me"", ""maybe i'm worthless"", your brain will not think ""the owner of me is thinking she will die"". The brain will think ""we will die"". So it will automatically starts to prepare the body for dying, if you don't do anything to stop it. When you do things that the brain autumatically associates with fear, like breathing quick and with tiny breaths, this will just make this even stronger.

So - what are the body doing when it's calm? I guess you all have at least somewhere you feel safe, how bad your anxiety even might be. Maybe it's in your mothers lap, sleeping next to your husband, walking the dog etc. When you feel safe - notice your body. Notice what it does. How it feels. How does it use its muscles? How do you breath? Remember this, and try to do this when you feel you start panic.

One easy thing is to breath with pauses. This is the things that's the effective part in square-breathing (I guess you all know what square-breathing is so I won't go into it, if anyone doesn't know just tell me and I'll tell you). When you breath with pauses, it's a **very** effective way of tricking your brain into thinking ""I'm safe here"". Just take a deep breath and hold it in for a few seconds, breath out and **hold it for a few seconds**(*it's important to do it also when you breath out*). I've never used square breathing but I've used this. The square has never made much sense to me.",,False,,t5_2qmij,False,,,True,t3_13whdn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/13whdn/why_you_feel_the_way_you_feel_chest_pain/,

Hope I can help.,Cytosolic,40,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1divfw/i_beat_gad_sad_6_years_ago_without_meds_hope_i/,"As the title suggests, I recovered from Generalized anxiety (GAD) and Social anxiety (SAD) about 6 or 7 years ago (I am 31 now) without the help of medications. I wanted to make a post that will hopefully help a few people through their conditions. I will try to be brief and get to the point, so i'll provide a short backstory and then get to what cured me.

Backstory: I started getting panic attacks at around 18, which lead to quite crippling GAD and then SAD. At my worst I was unable to leave the house for more than short periods of time. I had dozens of panic attacks daily, could barely interact with anyone but family, and was underemployed for many years. I tried dozens of medications for the first couple years, but nothing really treated me effectively, and many made things worse. I suffered immensely until I was 24.

I started seeing a therapist, who insisted that I had some deep seated trauma in my childhood causing my anxiety. Like probably most of you, there was nothing apparent causing my anxiety. It just happens to some people with no specific cause. My therapist kept digging for something, and I kept wasting money and saw no progress.

Therapy was a bust and I was completely hopeless. What changed my life was a book: Feeling Good by David Burns. It introduced me to the concept of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

I quickly realized that knowledge is power. I read about a dozen books about CBT, learned everything I could about anxiety and depression (namely, that negative thoughts are the root of the issue) and worked persistently through it all.

I spent about a year doing daily CBT exercises that I found in various books and on the internet. I LIVED this stuff. Every time I had a negative thought, I plucked it out and rationalized it. Told myself over and over that these thoughts were wrong and that I need to break the bullshit habit of irrational thought.

After maybe 6 months of CBT, I felt significant improvement. After a solid year, I was probably 75% cured. 6 years later, today, I can honestly say it's 95% gone. I've had maybe two panic attacks since, and I was able to talk myself through them so easily, they didn't last more than 2 minutes.

I'm now confident, successful, employed in a fantastic job and live independently. I didn't turn into the life of the party; I still need to work at social interaction, but I barely flinch at things that used to send me into a panic attack just thinking about.

I'm happy to answer any questions or provide details for anyone that needs it. I'm not suggesting that CBT will work for everyone and that medications are useless (they are extremely beneficial in certain situations) but I want to share my story in hopes that some people will benefit.",,False,,t5_2qmij,False,,,True,t3_1divfw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1divfw/i_beat_gad_sad_6_years_ago_without_meds_hope_i/,

**Slow breathing exercise**

*To be practised regularly and at the first signs of anxiety or panic.*

1. Hold your breath and count to 5 (do not take a deep breath)
2. When you get to 5, breathe out and say the word *relax* to yourself in a calm, soothing manner.

3. Breathe in and out slowly through your nose in a 6 second cycle. Breathe in for 3 seconds and out for 3 seconds. This will produce a breathing rate of 10 breaths per minute. Say *relax* every time you breathe out.
4. At the end of each minute (after 10 breaths) hold your breath again for 5 seconds and then continue breathing using the 6 second cycle.
5. Continue breathing in this way until all the symptoms of over-breathing or hyperventilation have gone.",,False,,t5_2qmij,False,,,True,t3_14ffpv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/14ffpv/relaxing_a_helpful_breathing_exercise_i_learnt/,

Is it shallow?",,43,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/11q73b/right_now_check_your_breathing_is_it_shallow/,"Just found this subreddit and I had to share something I realized today. I've been living with anxiety for as long as I can remember since I was a young child and I'm 22 now. I used to be on medication as a child, but I stopped taking the drugs of my own free will and have been un-medicated for 10+ years. Lately, it's been coupled with depression and I've been having occasional thoughts of suicide. Not even just passing thoughts, but lingering thoughts of not existing anymore and how I would end it and how it would be to die like that. I have very few friends and the friends I do have all know something is wrong with me, but I've never opened up about it - I can't.

What I really wanted to share was this: breathe. Today I noticed something about myself I had never noticed before - every breath I take is too shallow. I'm nearing the end of an EMT course (finally doing something with my life) and I've learned many new things about the body I had never even considered before. When a person is experiencing trauma, the depth of their breathing naturally becomes more shallow as the rate of the breathing increases. This causes the oxygen level in the blood to drop and the brain is very sensitive to this drop. Deprived of oxygen, the brain doesn't function normally and anxious tendencies increase dramatically. After realizing my automatic breathing was too shallow, I began to purposefully breathe deeply with each breath. After a few minutes, I felt a tingling sensation in my face and scalp while noticing increased awareness of everything around me. I guess I could say I felt more lucid and more at ease.

Breathe more slowly and breathe more deeply. The normal respiration rate for a healthy adult is 12-20 breaths/min and the depth (we call it tidal volume) should allow the chest to expand almost completely. My chest was barely expanding at all on each breath, this is called dyspnea and is an early sign of compensated shock. I also don't drink a lot of water which adds to the problems. People always say I look pale which is another sign of shock. Living on the edge of shock, experiencing trauma every waking moment, that doesn't help anxiety at all.

I've always been a bottler - anything bad that happens, I push it away, try not to think about it, run away from the negative feelings. When I was 12 I dealt with the death of my brother, that's when it started, I think. Since then, that's how I've learned to deal with pain - push it away.

Also, I've always been afraid to assert myself. My first instinct when someone does something that hurts me is that I've done something wrong. I've never let myself have a voice.

About a year ago, though, I had a very painful breakup with someone I cared deeply about, and suddenly I was in panic mode - shaking, heart racing, like I was afraid or panicking or something. I didn't realize it at the time, but this was basically the beginnings of an anxiety disorder. I had no idea what to do about it, but alcohol would numb it so I could sleep.

Then about 2 months ago, after having been off Zoloft for a few months, I went back to my Dr. and asked for something different. I tried Effexor, starting on a Saturday. By Sunday night, I was totally lethargic and apathetic - I knew this was not working. I called my Dr. on Monday and said I needed to stop taking it. Due to my having been a ""bad patient"" in the past, rather than help me, she released me from her practice. I was stunned - what was an anxiety disorder before became sheer psychic misery. It hurt to be awake - my whole upper body was in agony. I can't really even explain it, but my brain was on fire. I spent the next week in an alcoholic stupor trying to numb it away.

I found another Dr., and rather judge me and treat me like a child, he actually offered me care. Just walking out of there I felt my heart rate and blood pressure (which had been severely hypertensive) drop.

Eventually, through the use of Paxil and temporary use of Klonipin, I've become stable. But I still have bouts of anxiety and depression. Just today, I went bowling with my son, and on the way back, just thinking about the day and the week ahead, nothing seemed worthwhile or encouraging, anything I thought about made me miserable.

So I did the only thing besides medication that's been helping: I went into the bathroom and cried. Not just a little sniffle, but a full on temper tantrum (as quiet as I could), shaking my fists, getting as physically angry as I could while the kids are here. Thinking about the ways in which life has made me feel fucked over, unimportant, abandoned, and worthless, and telling all of them ""FUCK YOU!""

""FUCKYOUFUCKYOUFUCKYOUFUCKYOU!!!!""

After about a half an hour, relief started kicking in, and now I'm fairly calm again. Before, I was craving alcohol for the numb, but now I don't need it (trying to stay away from it as much as possible).

So for anyone feeling miserable, anxious, depressed, despondent, please: find a way to let it out. Don't worry about whether you feel you deserve to be angry, it doesn't matter - let yourself be, let it out, get physically angry, shake your fists, scream into a pillow and pound your fists on the bed, take a baseball bat and break up branches in your yard (just try not to do anything permanently destructive to yourself or property, and I really recommend doing this as privately as possible).

The first time I did this, I was just on my hands and knees throwing my head back and forth and crying as hard as I could. The next day I was sore as crap, but it helped, and it's continuing to help.

It's really working wonders for me, this is something I've never let myself do, never thought I deserved to be angry, never thought I was worthy.

FUCK THAT SHIT, I'M LETTING IT OUT!

So the next time you feel depressed, despondent, anxious - maybe it's just tantrum time. Let it out.

I hope this helps someone out there.

TLDR: Expressing physical anger is a great release and is helping me through my depression and anxiety, just do it as safely and privately as possible.

I can only guess why, but I have recently put in my two weeks at work for a new job, and I felt terrible about leaving all of my co-workers behind. The two weeks flew by in a terrible anxiety induced haze, but this week after my last day I bought a pair of running shoes and started running for the first time in probably 10 years and I've felt amazing since. Things were ~~a little better~~ really tough after the first run, but the best part has always come near the end of my sessions when the adrenaline has been flowing for a while. The anxiety crept back after a quick shower after the first run BUT was the best it had ever been. Slowly but surely it has dissipated after about a week. 

I'm not saying that exercise is the complete solution, I know that anxiety happens for different reasons, but it sure as hell doesn't hurt to try if you are physically able. I was inspired by [r/running](http://www.reddit.com/r/running), and I'd recommend checking out their beginner FAQ if you're interested. I'm doing the ""from your couch to 5K in nine weeks"" program, and while it was tough to start, it was well worth it, and I look forward to exercising on my running days now!

It's incredible to think that such a simple feeling like anxiety can make you feel so terrible, so hopeless. It's as if you will never escape it, that awful state of mind follows you around like your own shadow. Even when you feel alright, you know it's still there. You know that at any moment it could creep up and paralyze you with fear.


But you know what? You can beat this. You had the power to put the anxious thoughts in your head, and you have just as much power to conquer them. Your mind is just that: yours. You own the anxiety. Every debilitating panic attack, every anxious thought, they're all making you stronger. You're becoming more familiar with yourself; what makes you feel better, what makes you feel worse. All you have to do is try. So many people have beaten it, what makes you think you can't? You can do this. You're GOING to do this. It's going to be hard, but you aren't going to give up. And after you've gotten better, you can look back and realize how much stronger of a person you are for it.

I'm at the point where I'm just constantly angry with myself for allowing my life pass me by. I want to be successful and happy and I'm so fed up with the strangle hold my anxiety has on my life. Last week was tough. I won't go into the details, but suffice to say that all the things I have been avoiding finally piled up and created one massive, unavoidable problem. My anxiety was so bad I couldn't get out of bed. I'm done living like this. 

Tomorrow I have my first real appointment with my counselor (I've already met with him for the initial assessment). I'm shocked that I'm not feeling anxious about it. I'm actually kind of excited (what?!). I just want my life back, and this is the first step. 

Other than seeing a counselor bi-weekly, I'm finally going to start doing the things I know help me with my anxiety. I've always known these things help me, but I always seem to allow my anxiety to stop me from doing them (vicious cycle). These things include:

1. Exercising (daily)
2. Keeping a daily planner
3. Keeping my apartment tidy, and specifically, making my bedroom a calming and meditative environment
4. Sticking to a routine (e.g, having a routine for before I go to bed every night and doing it the same every night. this had been really helpful for me in the past, but like I said, I sabotage myself by saying ""oh, I'm too stressed to do that tonight"" when I know that not doing it will only make me more stressed) 
5. Reading (every night)

I've made these promises to myself before, but I've always let my anxiety get the better of me. I really want a better life. I'm not going to let my anxiety destroy another relationship or opportunity.

",Baba_Booeys_Teeth,40,7,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/p20t6/how_i_made_progress_today_and_you_can_too/,"So long story short I've developed some pretty annoying anxiety. Going into social situations / crowded places seems to just make me extremely nervous now. This developed slowly but surely over time.  HOWEVER, I have started counseling and I have learned some great things. (also, a quick Google search can really be quite helpful for anyone who cant get to, or afford a counselor). 

Basically here is how I made progress today, and how you can as well, if you are struggling with a similar form of anxiety.

be **aware**.    

**A**ccept that you're being anxious, do not fight it. As much as you may feel fighting it is the right thing to do, it's not.  

**W**atch your anxiety, and rate it on a scale of (1-10, or 1-100, whatever you like). By doing this you can maintain the idea that you are separate from your anxiety, which is KEY. This should keep your mind active and thinking about something OTHER than ""why do I feel this way"" etc. This really works, and I know it's a bit backwards to some, but trust me on this. 

**A**ct despite being anxious! Do not let it run your life, or force you to leave situations, because by doing that, you are perpetuating the emotion of fear, and letting it win. 

**R**epeat this process as much as possible, so that means, definitely challenge yourself, and work on it as much as you can. 

**E**xpect realistic results. So, dont assume the first time is going to be a magical cure, but instead, realize it's a journey that takes time!

More info on AWARE:  http://ukhypnosis.com/2010/01/09/being-aware-in-cognitive-therapy-for-anxiety/

Just by using this simple, yet effective technique, I was able to maintain myself in a situation today, where I have recently felt EXTREME anxiety. Like, palpitations, very shaky, etc. etc.  I was able to calm myself (not entirely, but enough) by taking myself OUT of the anxiety, accepting it, and recognizing it. By recognizing it, and realizing it cannot harm you, you're already winning half the battle, if not more. 

I hope this helps someone in a similar situation.  the main theme here of course being, DO NOT FIGHT IT. Don't leave, don't avoid, and accept it!

The problem with that places like this subreddit have very few people talking about success stories and a lot of people in anguish and suffering.


I wish that I could tell you what I did to cure myself, but it's not that simple. And lapses do happen. When I say 2 years I don't mean 2 years straight. I have had lapses, usually around winter time. But I move on from these lapses and instead of beating myself up and saying ""oh...there goes my streak, I'm back at square one"" I look at it as getting congested or getting a cold for a day or two and then going back to being healthy as opposed to suffering with a terminal illness.

I wrote notes to myself over the course of my recovery and the funny thing the notes all say a bunch of things that sometimes contradict each other. But I want to share with you a few of my resources as well as ""catch phrases"" that I implemented to make myself better.

The first: 

Embrace, and move on. As in, embrace the anxiety and move on. 

The second:

When you're feeling good don't look back and ask ""why, or what happened"" don't try to analyze the anxiety because you're basically telling yourself the anxiety is horrible, I don't want to experience it again, and now I have to find out what I did wrong so I make sure it never happens again. That just makes anxiety your focus. To be anxiety free anxiety cannot be your main focus in life.

Third:

I can handle it. If a thought pops in my head. I can handle it. If I feel a feeling, I can handle it. If I lapse, I can handle it. If I'm afraid of something that might happen in the future, I can handle it if it does. 


Now as far as resources go:

[And the meditation subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation)


Meditation has been my favorite way to deal with my negative feelings, and developing new and more positive feelings. 


Another thing that helps is to try and go 30 days without entertaining a negative thought. Negative thoughts will pop up but you learn to ignore them. This isn't that easy unless you have done the above exercises with meditation and the MoodGym. 


Also some helpful facts to learn about your anxiety. Your anxiety has no mass or volume. It does not build up within you. You can have a cumulative of muscle tension and tightness from constant worrying but you can visualize that build up leaving you and escaping you and being pushed out of you if you like. 

Also turn negative thoughts into cartoony thoughts. Make them ridiculous, transform them in your minds eye into little balls or orbs trying to penetrate your head and imagine yourself having a force field of good will and love preventing the bad thought from taking hold of you. Sometimes transforming a thought into something non threatening and shapeless etc helps a lot to make it dissipate.

I don't think I'll visit this subreddit again or really stick around to answer too many questions. This seems very selfish of me and maybe unhelpful but I know if I stick around here, people will start describing symptoms I may or may not have had, and these symptoms might start appearing in me or I might start experiencing your anxieties as my own etc. and one of the best things I have learned for my peace of mind is to remove myself from places like this.

It's not that places like this can't be helpful, or can't be therapeutic, but for me personally, in order to be anxiety free I must starve my anxiety of any fuel it may want to re-ignite and I really enjoy my life right now too much and love being ""normal"" (whatever that is) too much and have too many responsibilities to the people I love to revisit my old symptoms and other peoples symptoms. 


For me, anxiety is contagious! But I wanted to show you people some love and tell you that I have been there and give you hope. Not false hope but actual hope from someone who has been there done that. 

Do what feels right for you. I created my own cure script and had a progress journal for about 2 years. I went 2 years anxiety, 2 years cured. I'd like to make it 3, 4 etc etc. 


One thing I can say however is that it doesn't matter how long you've had it (as I learned from anxietycure.co.uk) once you start taking positive action you get positive results. But it's hard.


If I where to describe to you what it feels like to be anxiety free, it's like feeling light. Like your muscles have exhaled all the anxiety, your brain feels clean, and shiney, and smooth.  Your chest is open and warm. And your overactive mind is now chewing up philosophy and spirituality, and interests, hobbies, politics, life and no longer chewing over worries, medical websites, symptoms, analyzations, testing yourself, thinking you're nuts, etc.


This is all very jumbled and I don't want to create a TL;DR because I feel like there has to be something in what I've written that has to help somebody out there, but I will tell you that I used to suffer from OCD (sexual), panic disorder, pure O, GAD. Used to take 100mg of Sertralin, now I only take half a 50 pill everyday (because part of me is afraid of going through severe withdrawals so I am weaning myself off VERY slowly)

My anxiety had mostly been about my anxiety. Feeling trapped. What if thinking. Fear of suicide. What if I can't handle it? What if I go crazy? What if I develop schizophrenia etc etc. Obsessions over physical processes like breathing (convincing myself that if I didn't breathe manually I would not breathe at all) touching, seeing, hearing. Fear of becoming depressed and not liking the things I liked and what would I do if that happened. Reading anxiety websites for the magic cure. Obsessively taking notes everytime I felt something and analyzing it to death. Etc. etc. Beating myself up for being so strange. Judging other anxiety sufferers to be weirdos and then telling myself that I am a weirdo too and shouldn't be trusted around people. Fears of my sexuality transforming into something unhealthy or evil.

Phew. That was a lot to get out. But believe it or not, that is all gone. I love you guys. You're not weird. You're brain is programmed to scan for danger and you have taught it that whatever you fear or feel is dangerous, so you are obsessed with it. And you are afraid to stop because you feel that you will be out of control or things will be worse if you don't do your ritual or you don't worry about that impossible thing that will never happen.

It takes a long long time to learn to embrace uncertainty and realize that it's actually better to feel that out of control fearful feeling for a day or two than just do the same thing over and over and over again and feel like crap forever. 


Best of luck to all of you. Don't hate me for not sticking around. I'm like Lot's wife. I can't look back or I'll turn to sand. Gotta keep moving forward. Much love to all of you and support and good wishes.

TL;DR Blah blah blah  Embrace uncertainty

Now, however, I've turned off my people pleasing personality unless I'm with someone I really love and really care about.  I save that part of me for the people who deserve it.

Today I was put in a situation where I had to make a choice, I did not know how the person would react to my decision and I had two choices.  Do what they would have wanted and make them happy while I was not.  Or - do what I wanted to make me happy, and leave them unhappy.

The old me would have not given it a second thought, and made the choice that would please the other person.

Instead, I went ahead and made the choice I wanted. 

That person isn't happy... but it won't kill them!  And nothing bad happened to me due to putting myself first.

I wanted to share this as I'm sure there are a lot of people in here that live life to please others.  I missed out on a lot by caring more about pleasing others than myself.  But no longer - and today I got to reap the benefits.  I hope some day you can too.

I really just felt that I was having trouble adjusting and that it would go away, but it hasn't yet. My boyfriend goes to school in the area too, but I started before him so we were apart for about a month. I thought that as soon as he got here everything would be a lot better, but I'm still having anxiety, especially in the morning. 

At first i was anxious about the move, whether i made the right decision, etc., and missing my boyfriend. Recently it changed to me being anxious about my college classes, but now I seem to be anxious for no reason. 
The last 3 days I've woken up feeling sick to my stomach and actually did get mildly sick. I thought it was because of a test I had Tuesday, but this morning I still felt sick. Even this afternoon when I woke up from a nap, I felt incredibly anxious for honestly no reason. 

I don't understand what's going on and why I can't seem to get rid of this. 
Anyone have any of the same experiences or advice? 
Thanks.

UPDATE: I just wanted to tell you guys that the past 5 days have been way better. The drinking more water idea has really been helping me, and so has just trying to stay as positive as I can all day.

I thoroughly researched the place online, then spent about an hour scoping it out, pacing around, and smoking.  I went in once, then walked out, waited another 30 minutes and went in again.

The place was playing loud music, which I was grateful for - anything to make people talk less is good in my books.  I told the stylist that I wanted just a trim, and to have my bangs level with my eyebrows, nothing fancy.  I could see that she was going to cut off too much, but I didn't want to say anything (would she get mad?  distant?  think I didn't communicate clearly the first time?  think I'm a bad customer?) so I just went with it.  Now I'm at home, looking at myself in the mirror, and hating it.

My bangs are definitely crooked, and my friend says its no big deal, just go back and get them to correct it.  I just can't bring myself to do it.  I spent so long building up the courage to get it done, I feel exhausted.  My mind races with the possible conversations I would have to have.  All the explaining, and talking, and possible reactions they might have.  Will they deny it's crooked?  Will they tell me it's too bad because I said it was okay at the time?  Will they ask for proof I got it cut there?  (I don't have a receipt)  Will they do a bad job just because I'm a bother?  I don't know.  I'll just end up trying to fix it myself I guess. This is why I hate doing these things.

Throughout that time, my parents have mostly paid attention to my brother's health. Which is understandable, because he's required a significant amount of hospital time and is constantly in physical pain.

The issue arises here, in that when I need help from my family they blow it off because I'm not obviously hurting. Frequently I'm told that it's all in my head and thus doesn't require their attention or help. This causes a lot of fights and tension that have yet to be resolved.

I feel nauseous seriously all the time, even when I don't have anything to actually be worried about.  There are very few moments when I *don't* feel like I'm going to be sick.  The feeling gets way worse when I actually have something legitimate to be nervous about, like a job interview or something... those times are like debilitating, I just can't pull myself together and end up getting shaky and it's just a really awful feeling.

I tried citalopram a couple years ago, and on the bright side it got rid of my constant nauseous feeling and improved my general mood (made me worry a lot less about the ridiculous small things I usually spend hours each day obsessing over....), but, the negatives outweighed the postives for me honestly.  I didn't feel necessarily calmed down like I've heard some people say, instead it was the opposite, I felt like... wild, I just had this feeling of not giving a fuck about the consequences of anything I did, which I think was brought on by the citalopram because once I stopped taking it, that feeling went away and I returned to being my cautious self.

My question is this: has anyone been able to control their anxiety without medication?  I really don't like what taking medication did to me so I'd like to avoid it if possible.  I know there are other options besides citalopram, but I'd just really prefer to try and do it myself, I really don't want my decision making or sex drive or anything to be affected by medication.  I just don't know if the constant anxiety I have is even something that can be helped by a non-medicinal solution alone. I do smoke trees so if I'm at home and I have an anxiety attack, I'll smoke a bowl which definitely gets rid of my nausea.  But, of course that isn't really an option when I'm at work, which is why I'm trying to find a solution to get my anxiety under control.

But lately in the last few weeks I have had nothing but constant anxiety attacks.

It usually is a thought or a minor discomfort, and the next thing I know, my stomach is set to vomit. I try to minimize the risk with mints or gum which help plenty in a social environment. I also try to carry around Pepto, which placebo or not in this circumstance should help.

I am just trying to say, is there anything I can do to alleviate this, or will I always feel worried sick in public? Its been sporadic throughout my whole life. 

But the worst part is once you feel sick, there is no going back. Its all in my head, and my head is sabotaging me. I can hardly eat sometimes because of a minor discomfort causes me to worry, causing nausea, and a full fledged panic attack. 

I really don't want to have to go back to my Celexa, I tried to make it so long with out it, but I think that was my only help to the anxiety. Until then, I have neurontin which should help. I am prescribed 2 100mg pills 3x daily, so I am hoping taking that more consistently would help. 


I just really want to know if there is any advice? This is the worst feeling for me and it so depressing to feel nothing but sickness while the rest of the world enjoys strolling around carefree and having fun, while I am constantly worried about vomiting. 

Sorry for the long post, I cannot sleep because of this damn anxiety I got just typing this letter out.

I was going to drive home, so I didn't drink anything but apple juice and some soda. When we were at the party, we decided that I would drive some of the family's friends home, which was quite a long drive. When I was driving, suddenly the cops came and pulled me over. They told me that some people driving behind me earlier thought that I was driving unstable, and had called the cops as they thought I was drunk-driving. 

The real issue here was when they pulled me over. When the cops walked over to my car, i suddenly started shaking, and I felt my heart beating extremely fast. As I didn't want my passengers to be worried, i focused a lot, and managed to stop shaking. They gave me an alcohol test, which was negative, told me not to worry (I think they saw how stressed out I was) and then I got in the car and drove away.

I remained calm until i dropped off my passengers, and started driving towards my apartment. On my way home, a car behind me started flashing its lights repeatedly on me (in a tunnel), and at that point, I freaked out. I drove off the highway, and took a longer way home, just to get away from that car. When I parked outside my apartment, i just sat down next to the car, shaking extremely and I started crying, unable to stop. 

When I got into my apartment, which was hard (as I didn't get my key into the keyhole), i just sat on the floor, crying. As I am writing this, I am starting to hear things, and I fear I won't be able to sleep tonight...

Don't be discouraged.  ,dweckl,32,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/tqxpm/rax_not_every_therapist_is_good_they_are_like/,"When I was 12 years old I had a therapist tell me I was ""lazy,"" because that therapist met with my asshole father before meeting with me, and my father essentially told the therapist how to view me.  

When I was 22, I spent 8 months in psychotherapy and saw no results at all for anxiety. 

When I was 30 or so, I went to hypnotheraptists and some EMDR nut.  No results. 

I found cognitive behavioral therapy.  The guy I found was good - real good.  He speaks/teaches all over, and he's got a LOT of angles to deal with difficult minds that don't want to release bad thoughts. 

I also found a local woman, who was not good, but definitely was a CBT practitioner.  She was a year or so out of school, and her chops were not tight yet. 


A good therapist for anxiety must WORK WITH YOU.  This means trying different approaches, accepting your honest feedback, knowing when they are heading in the wrong direction, and having the experience to spot the sticking points and help you overcome them. 

From my experience personally, and from reading books on CBT, including instructor manuals, a good therapist should direct you to RESULTS quickly.  Like within 3 months you should have a lot of ""ah ha"" moments where you realize exactly what your mind is doing to you, why, and how to stop it.  Then after that you should be working toward automatically stopping the anxious responses to the underlying thoughts. 

If your therapist is not helping, don't fret.  Try another one, supplement with books/workbooks/audio/meetup.com groups, or whatever.  But don't think it's a lost cause, because it's not.

I went to the mall yesterday with a friend, because she asked me to go ""job hunting"" with her.

I've never had a part-time job before, and I'm young...but, she's had a job before. On Tuesday night I was making myself nauseous at the thought of approaching a staff member/manager to ask if they're hiring, and handing my resume in. I thought I'd end up getting rejected or everyone would say, ""Sorry...not hiring""

I thought my friend would take the lead since she's done this before, but actually, I was the one who approached  95% of the people to inquire. I put on a smile, and I just went for it (completely faking it...that isn't me *at all*)

But I ended up giving in my resume to 9 places, one place told me that I'd have to apply online, and when I got home I applied to two other places.

I have a bad feeling about a couple of the places, because I know they probably won't do anything with my resume. But for most of the places, at least right now, I'm feeling like I have a slight chance.

I'm worried about possibly getting an interview, because I don't think I can pull off that kind of fake confidence again, one-on-one, but I'm happy I did something out of my comfort zone.

I suffer from sometimes debilitating panic attacks. 90% of them happen at night during my sleep and wake me up to shattered nerves and a racing heart. I have found something that seems to help me a lot. If you haven't heard of ASMR it stands for autonomous sensory meridian response. It is a tingling, almost trance-like sensation people get from certain ""triggers"" such as whispering, paper tearing, scratching, nail tapping, head massaging, etc.. Look it up for more info. My main point is to tell everyone that YouTube is ull of videos of people doing these triggers. Well, it turns out for me that these videos don't trigger any ASMR sensations for me, but they do make me EXTREMELY relaxed and can ease my mind before bed so I don't worry about an anxiety attack. I would suggest looking into it if you have the time and don't find it weird lol. Anyways, have a great day everyone.

we went to bed and i couldnt stop myself from going over and over the past few hours in my head trying to figure out what i had said and done wrong. I asked her again and she said ""baby just let it go! cant you just let it go?"" at this point anxiety really washed over me and i was shaky and nervous. since i had NO idea what i had done i began to wonder how bad it was....(the thing i seemed to have done) she refused to tell me and i began to tear up.

I said i was worried that all day tomorrow im going to be wondering what i did. and she said i was trying to ""guilt"" her into telling me what i had done. she said now i definitely cant tell you because then youll always pry for it.

she tried to comfort me though. she knows i have anxiety and that i worry about breakups and she told me ""im not gonna break up with you baby dont worry""

and thats the worst part because sometimes im totally normal,  and sometimes i worry that the slightest fuck up will cause her to dump me. the LOGICAL part of me knows that makes no sense and that she cares for me and wouldnt just do that at the drop of a hat. but the ANXIETY part of me is terrified from time to time.

1355703443.0,30,self.Anxiety,14ys7m,The fear of having a panic attack might give me a panic attack.,ukuleletroll,37,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/14ys7m/the_fear_of_having_a_panic_attack_might_give_me_a/,"So...yeah. I've been suffering from depression for quite a while now.  I'm not sure whether this belongs here or in /r/depression , but I need to talk to *somebody* about it.

Sometimes in the middle of the night, without any warning, I'll have the most awful panic attacks imaginable. I'll be in the pitch dark, and I can't breathe properly because I'm hyperventilating, and sometimes can't even move to put the light on. Then I'll be scared that I'm dying, which makes me panic more.

Normally if I can't recover from a panic attack I'll go and wake up one of my housemates to calm me down.  It's really unfair, I know, and I feel really pathetic every time I do it. I appologise every time and each time I do it I tell myself it's the last time.

A few nights ago I had the worst panic attack of my whole life.  I'd been on a massive low for the entire day and nothing could pull me out of it.  I'd also seen my counsellor that day, which always makes me more emotional, and I'd yelled at a priest, which made me feel worse about myself.  I was lying awake in bed thinking, *I can't go on like this any longer*.  And then I thought, *If nothing has changed by the new year, I'll kill myself.*

I'd had suicidal thoughts before, but never something as final or drastic as that.  And the idea that I could feel that bad about myself pushed me over the edge into full-on panic attack.  Sweating, shaking, writhing. Palpitations and hyperventilation. I had a loss of control, a sense of impending death I'd never felt before.  I was also face-down in my bed, face in my pillow, and I couldn't move because it was so intense.  My breathing was getting faster and shallower. I was going to suffocate, and I was trapped in my own panicking body.  There was no escape.

I managed to pull my arm out from underneath me and reach for my phone, and called my housemate, who I have as my first speed-dial.  I wasn't able to speak. I tried to say I was having a panic attack but my breathing was too fast to say anything. My memory gets fuzzy at that point.  I think he asked where I was and I might have managed to get out ""bed"". Next thing I know he's in my room and the light is on and I've been pulled into a sitting position and he helped me to breathe.

It took a while for me to calm down, and much longer to get to sleep. When I called him, he thought I'd done something stupid. I feel horrible. For waking him up, for scaring him, for being a terrible, ineffectual, selfish mess of a human being.

I'm pretty sure if I hadn't managed to phone him I'd have died.  That scares the hell out of me.  And confuses me.  The reason I had the attack in the first place was because I wanted to die.  Was my body fighting my head, trying to get me to live?  I don't know whether I want to live or die any more.  For now, I just exist.

But what if he wasn't there?  What if I had nobody?  At the moment, my house is empty. I'm alone, in the middle of the night, in an empty house.  If I had another attack that bad, I might not be able to calm myself down.

I began panicking about that, and it almost turned into another panic attack.  Then I decided to write this post. And writing about it has calmed me down a little, and made me feel less pathetic.  Thank you for reading.

My Sociology/History classmates ask me when they see me if I've dropped out of the course but I just say I've been too sick to go. History I have an A+ in because it's all lecture and I've completed both essay assignments and the first exam and the lectures are online, so it's a zero-effort class. Sociology is similar. What I'm truly worried about is Precalculus, which I'm failing and have only attended twice in two months. Every time I wake up on time to go to class I have this overwhelming anxiety that forces me to hide in my room for most of the day. Sometimes I don't come out for days, and I don't eat. I worry that my effort to recover from my surgery, strep, and bronchitis is futile and that there is nothing I can do to bring my grade back up. My teacher won't admit that she is partially at fault for not answering my emails when I was ill. The syllabus does say that there are no makeup quizzes (the majority of our grade) unless there is prior notification, which she had plenty from me. All she said when I met with her was that I had to pass the final with at least a B to get a D in the class. She claimed that her computer was broken for 3 days and that is why she didn't get my emails and that she will not honor them. It upset me so much because I was prepared for them, and now I've gone into a deep depression and become agoraphobic because I think that there is nothing I can do. My biggest concern is having to show my parents my final grades. I had to drop one course already after my surgery, and now this. Oh and another fun thing I deal with: I have so much anxiety  over speaking about my anxiety that I won't go to counseling. Every time I have to go in that building I get nauseated.

I can play with them like some kind of futuristic, holographic CAD system, changing and testing things out until I figure out a good methodology. That means when I finally create something new with my hands, it can sometimes like someone with a lot of experience actually did the work.  (I've unfortunately never made a career out of that ability, though).

I guess having a multi-dimensional imagination like that is like a double-edged sword.   I am slowly starting to realize that a lot of my ""processor cycles"" (I like using computer terminology to describe my brain) are burned up on imagining conversations with abusive people.  I seem to be constantly practicing, practicing, practicing strategies on what I'd say to them.  

If they say X to me, I figure out a clever Y verbal strategy for it.  Then I keep mentally refining my strategy as I continue to drive, to attempt to do housework, or whatever is in front of me.  This, of course, screws up my ability to sleep.  

I've always battled this inner battle as just part of my inner mental background noise.  I've never really considered it's implications in the front of my brain before.  Kinda like being a fish raised in polluted water trying to consider what clear, healthy water might actually feel like.

In a way, much of that effort is wasted, because I never thought to write down my snappiest, best verbal comebacks and defenses.  I know I have come up with some pretty clever stuff in the past and it's wasted with the fact that my memory just can't remember all those strategies.  That's a hell of a lot of perfectly good ""processor cycles"" wasted on trying to fight verbally/emotionally abusive people which my anxious subconscious constantly conjures up for me to fight.

I am in a relationship, and my very gentle, concerned SO sometimes comments: ""Are you in pain?  You look like you are in pain!""  My responses have been anywhere between being reactively mean/snappish to a confused ""I don't know, I'm just sitting here/washing dishes/etc.""  

It's starting to slooooooowly sink in that there often seems to be a coincidence between when I am in the heat of fighting that mental battle with whenever that feedback is told to me.  

I used to fantasize a lot about physical revenge too, but when I confided to my SO about that, I got feedback that is absolutely not healthy.  So I've mentally toned that down somewhat.  Still not giving it up completely.

The thing is... (a) I don't have any verbal abusive people in my life right now because I've given up having many friends and (b) the rare times when a verbally abusive person DOES come along, they often come up with a verbal tactic I hadn't considered yet.  If they've succeeded in hurting me, that's another fight that keeps running over and over in the back of my brain.

Growing up in a family from hell, you simply don't have much of an emotional feel for what's normal/healthy and ya take so much negative stuff for granted.  

I keep desperately NEEDING to fight this fight inside.  As long as you can keep up the fight, you don't have to accept that you've lost the war.  

I feel like an old soldier of a conquered country.  The battle is gone into history. The abusers from the other side have already have already had their satisfaction from their sadistic game of hurting their POW victim and enjoying his/her cries of pain.  They've already left, laughing and enjoying the physical and mental triumph of crushing the humanity of their victim.   

The old soldier still wants to keep fighting the war, even as he/she is not physically or mentally capable of it anymore.  The old soldier just can't accept that they've already won.  

I'm officially labeled as disabled now because they've won.  I don't want to know this... I don't want to feel this...  if I give up this mental fight, I am going to feel like someone who was brutally raped, mentally speaking.  It would be the ultimate defeat. I don't want to believe it, I don't want to feel it, I don't want to let it sink in to my brain that they've actually, utterly, completely won.  :'-(

Is there anyone else out there who is like this?

(For the record, I've been in therapy for a bunch of years.  My current therapist is amazingly clued and effective but expensive, so I only get to see her maybe once a month at best.)

EDIT: Holy CRAP this was long.  I'm too tired to do a TL;DR, sorry.  
For those who read it, thanks for listening.

EDIT2:  (6 hours later)  A small bit of progress... I felt my subconscious starting one of those accusation dialogs today and instead of engaging in it, I said ""that's your opinion"" and kept going.  I kinda felt like a more mature person in that moment.  I can still feel it happening on a more non-verbal level, but I'll take any progress that I can get.

EDIT3:  A week later...  looks like talking about it has helped me to be able to start noticing the arguments and decide not to engage more and more.

Not sure how bad it is but if I'd have to guess I'd say it's somewhere between moderate and severe. It's not severe enough for me to not leave the house but it's triggered as soon as I walk out the door to my room (and even when in my room writing things in forums like this). My social anxiety is general, not specific. There are loads of things which I get really anxious about (thinking that people are looking at me and judging me, meeting new people etc). One of the things which I'm very scared of is talking in front of a group of people. Doesn't matter if it's a small or a big group, I freak out anyway. I sometimes even go ""mute"" because my body tense up so much and my mind is so chaotic that I feel like I can't open my mouth.

I'm going to start university in the end of August. I really want to study and I'm determined to do so. However, I'm sort of panicking because I know you have to give a lot of presentations and participate in group discussions when studying. I'm also freaking out about having to meet new people. Thinking about it even makes me doubt my decision to study but I have goals and dreams and I'm going to achieve them. Quite a few people (professionals) have told me that my diagnoses (social anxiety disorder, GAD, OCD and depression, though I'm personally not convinced I've got OCD) limit my chances of succeeding when it comes to studies but I'm planning on proving them wrong. I'm terrified but I'm going to prove them wrong.

Now I'm simply wondering if any of you have got social anxiety disorder (or any of the other diagnoses) or if any of you have got issues with presentations etc? If you've been to or if you're going to university/college would you please let me know how that's been going for you? Has it been going well? Do you get used to presentations and group discussions? Any advice?

I'm a 26 old student driver from mainland Europe, and I'm just so tired of being afraid to drive a car.

I'm not really sure if this is a common fear, but I certainly feel weird to see my peers and much younger friends drive around so casually, while I can't keep my stomach from becoming uneasy at the mere thought of having to *drive* somewhere.

I don't know why I have it, I've been in some small car accidents (without being at the wheel), but nothing major and never felt shock of any kind. So it wouldn't stem from that I'd say.

Is anxiety genetic? I have had some hard times getting to learn to drive with my father, who's a bit of an OCD person himself, and quite the pannicky, pessimist (always assumes worst case scenarios). Could that have influenced me or 'taught' me this fear?

Even then, I'll try to mitigate any chance of failure by metering out each and every intersection on my way on Google Streetview, even though it's all pretty bland and straightforward. Still, it seems to ease my fears a little, but I'm afraid that might become a habit I won't be able to shake (eg realizing I wouldn't dare to drive if I hadn't planned it all out). Note though that I'm not yet accustomed to just driving places, while a lot of people can drive to places almost on command. Furthermore I usually don't have a GPS with me.  

In trying to combat it, I've tried some breathing tricks, like the 7-11 method (7 second breathe-in, 11 second breathe out) the difference in time has an automatic calming effect on me. 

Alcohol also reduces the fear, but obviously prohibits me from driving.

I don't want to take any medication, I'd be frowned upon as everyone here seems to expect the 'ideal' family, and having to break with that image would dent my image even more. I don't know if talking to a professional would help, as it only manifests itself when I'm confronted with driving.

I try to go driving at least once each day (tried to go for one hour each day, but that's a bit much at the moment), and I can drive, shift and get where I need to be, but the fear keeps coming back. 

Still, once I get driving, I usually calm down pretty quickly and don't do too badly either (although I make some small mistakes now and then, but I know my traffic rules). That's why I wonder why this fear keeps coming back, I don't want to be afraid, I just want to drive a car like my 18yr old niece and my 78yr old grandma can.

Any ideas on what else I could try, or people who have faced similar anxiety related situations?

I'm a bit conflicted on whether I should accept said fear, sometimes I feel like I can trick myself into forgetting I have it, and then it won't rear its ugly head and I feel more relaxed. But if I remind myself of it (involuntary triggered by a random thought), things often get harder than they should be. So that makes me wonder whether I could perhaps force myself to forget I have such a fear?

1364827497.0,29,self.Anxiety,1bfaax,Klonopin and Xanax - a comparison for anxiety,sennheiserz,31,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1bfaax/klonopin_and_xanax_a_comparison_for_anxiety/,"I've read a lot of threads on here about Klonopin vs Xanax, and having taken xanax as needed for panic attacks, I recently came off some light painkiller use and had started taking more xanax (still less than 1.5 MG/day) as I've been rather stressed lately. 

I went to my DR and basically said I didn't like the high/crash constant pill popping of xanax and wanted something that I could take in the morning and be good for...a while. Keep in mind, I've never taken SSRIs as I don't feel I have a chemical imbalance, but mostly that I am under a lot of pressure most of the time and get overwhelmed, not depressed so much.

I got a precription for Klonopin 1MG twice a day (I only use it either 1 MG per day or .5, I just like being overprescribed so that I don't have to pay my psychiatrist each month or if I forget to make an appt I don't run out). As well as some xanax for breakthrough anxiety as needed.

I have to say that I'm really liking the klonopin. Here's my breakdown as I see it, and again, this stuff works totally different for different people and I'm not a doctor.

Xanax (alprazolam):

Pros-

* Great for breakthrough anxiety attacks
* Great for knocking yourself out on a airplane, although there will be a hangover
* Fast acting with a bit of a rush to know its gonna be okay
* Great to keep in your pocket to ward off anxiety because you know you can diffuse it
* If you smoke trees or do psychadelics, invaluable for getting you out of a freakout

Cons

* Very short acting, meaning re-dosing often and riding a bit of a roller coaster
* Very tough on memory, even .5 mg means I might get some brownout retrograde amnesia about what I did the previous day while on it.
* Makes my stomach feel kinda weird, like empty and just a little uncomfortable
* I don't drink much, but be careful with booze around xanax

Klonopin (clonezepam):

Pros-

*  Don't feel medicated, just feel rather normal and somewhat more confident, good for social anxiety
*  The long acting properties means you don't think about it which (if you have an addictive personality) means you just kinda take it occasionally, but there's no reason to be popping these more than once or twice a day (morning and night is a popular regiment)
*  Takes less than an hour to kick in, don't really notice it
* Great for productivity, doesn't cloud thinking in smaller doses and lowers inhibitions in a good way.
* Cuts off anxiety at its source, just seems to stop the worrying cycle
* Takes the edge of smoking trees without totally killing your buzz
* Nice warm feeling and relaxing
* Less amnesia
* Easier to get off of as it is longer lasting and tapers itself nicely

Cons

* Not great for instant panic situations, although you'll have less of them.
* Not very useful recreationally (yay!)

Having been using it for a few weeks now, I really really like it and how it helps me be the person I knew I should be. Meditation and talk therapy are also part of my regiment, but this is one medicine change I've been very happy with.

I find the strength to be somewhat comparable, but to me 1mg xanax feels like 1.5-2mg of Klonopin.

Best of luck out there, it's going to be okay.

I just want to know if anyone else struggles with this, and how they deal.

Most of the time, I'm fine. I've had episodic depression in the past (normally when I go through a big change), and my family has a history of struggling with mental illness. I have recently gone through a big change (graduated from college).

I have been thinking about death more and more lately (not suicide but the fact that everyone dies). Even reading about historical things, I can't help but think about how all the people I'm reading about are now dead and someday me and everyone I know will be too. This scares the shit out of me.

I want to just enjoy life and the people in it and get what I ""want"" out of life. Problem is - I have no idea what I want so I'm constantly second guessing myself. ""Is this what I want to do? Is this what I want out of life? How will I be able to tell? How can I tell if this is better than plan b or c or d? What is wrong with me...shouldn't I know what makes me happy?...etc, etc"" and obviously it spirals out of control from there.

It's gotten to the point where it affects my mood at times. Sometimes I'll have random ""freak out"" episodes where I'll feel like my life has been a dream and I don't know myself or anyone in it.
I am taking advantage of a really amazing opportunity right now (volunteering in a beautiful country for a few months) and want to make the most of it. I don't want this negativity to affect me anymore. I know I've been rambling but any advice would be so appreciated.

Side note: I used to take antidepressants but went off of them about two years ago. I have been doing fine until recently.

First time posting in this sub.  I've had anxiety since high school (26 now) and it's been well under control for several years -- just half-yearly checks with my psychiatrist, and a pretty low dosage of an SSRI.

And then about 2 weeks ago my husband and I adopted a dog.  And there's seriously nothing wrong with the dog.  He is a housebroken, 10 month old terrier mix.  He loves to sit in your lap and go on walks and squeak his toys.  Ever since we got him, I have been a wreck -- crying randomly (even in public, which is *really* embarrassing), unable to eat, upset stomach, insomnia, all of it.  Whenever I look at him I start to feel anxious and sick.  I wake up in the middle of the night when he's in his crate (asleep) thinking ""What if he has to go out? What if he goes to the bathroom?  What if he's sad?"".  He peed on a blanket yesterday night and I shook for hours.

Everyone tells me that it's a transition to go from no-pets to having a pet.  I understand this, but I feel like I can't function.  I don't even want to get out of bed in the morning.  My husband says that the problem is with me, not the dog, and I agreed to get a dog so I have to live with my decision, but all I want is for the dog to be gone.  But I don't even want to go home because the dog is waiting there for me, behaving perfectly, and my entire response is irrational but I feel like I'm trapped in this situation and I'm panicking.

Any suggestions on how to approach this situation?

[Rant]",thisguysthrowaway23,32,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/tc9xc/i_really_really_hate_it_when_people_ask_me_about/,"Whenever people try to make small talk with me, they always, without fail, ask me ""What are you going to school for?"" (always those exact words, every time.) To which I reply ""a computer science degree."" And I always get a terrible feeling about it, because I know it's something I'm should be giving a shit about, but it's so hard for me to do so.

Worse still is when they ask me how long I've got left (my parents in particular are fond of this question), and I can't even give them a straight answer. I've completed my fifth year for what was supposed to be a four year degree, with still no end in sight. And it doesn't help that I only took two classes this semester (they were the only two from their stupid flowchart that I could find available) and they were both in the evening (morning/afternoon classes would fit my life way better, but NONE of the classes I needed were offered in that timeframe).

To top it off, I'm positive I've failed one of those classes, and there's a fair chance I'm going to fail the other, too, because it's so goddamn hard for me to concentrate because I don't give a shit about anything they teach. I can concentrate on Skyrim and Reddit and anime without a problem, sure, but when it comes to shit I actually have to do, shit I keep dumping thousands and thousands of dollars into, I can only focus on it for maybe ten minutes before I get distracted for hours. I have only myself to blame for this, too, because it was so easy for me to coast through high school with that mentality, and I can't seem to break my old habits and fit them into a college lifestyle.

I hate school so much. I hate that I chose to go to such an expensive school, to learn things I'm only going to forget once I'm finished with the final exam, things that I can easily Google on the offchance that I actually need them in the real world. I hate that I'm putting myself close to $100 thousand in debt and yet I STILL can't focus enough to not fail classes left and right. I hate that some fat cat is lining his pockets because of my stupid choices. I hate that I'm pretty much stuck having to complete this, otherwise I've sunk almost 100 grand for absolutely nothing. I hate that all this is really going to get me is a slip of paper that some fat guy in a suit is going to consider for ~30 seconds, before hiring me into a job I'm probably going to hate, but be stuck in for the rest of my life because I have to pay off the school loans that got me through a school I hated so I can get a decent-paying job to pay them off. I hate how all my high school teachers insisted I go to college, and I, young and naive, did exactly that, and by the time I was old enough to realize how fucked up the system was and how universities are just corporations that give more of a shit about lining their own pockets than actually providing a quality education, they had already caught me in their disgusting trap.

I hate the system.

The worst part is, I don't even get to experience the fun part of college. I drive there twice a week, I talk to literally no one, I sit in class, I browse Reddit instead of paying attention to the lecture, and I go home. I never go to any college parties, I never hang around cute girls, I never joined any fraternities, I never joined any clubs, none of that. I have no friends there (although I do have non-college friends, at the very least). I know they have stuff going on at least once a month, like movies and comedians and shit, but it's usually on Thursdays or Fridays, when I only have classes on Mondays and Wednesdays, and I can't rationalize making the 40 mile one way commute just to watch a movie and not talk to anyone since I don't know anyone in the first place, and I really, really don't have the ability to walk up to a random person and strike up a conversation.

So, there were and are pets in the building (including the people who were living in my unit immediately before me).

People have said this before to me in an offhand ""I suppose it's true"" way, like they're just saying things they don't really believe. But this old Australian man who was driving me to Saltspring Island was saying it in a new way. He was saying it with the tone you'd say ""I have anxiety"" or ""I was born in Geneva""- not a story you need other people to validate, because you know it's true.

I'll often carry on conversations just to humour the person who picks me up hitchhiking. But in that moment I was purely curious. ""Why do you think that?"" I asked.

He related a few stories, starting with a narrow escape from decapitation in rural India, ending with being on the board of directors of several successful companies. He seemed to be well-off, so I believed him on the last part. 

His name was Lee, and sometimes I see old people who want young people to confirm that they're still cool, he honestly didn't seem to give a shit about that. But he wanted to talk. So I listened. 

He explained that a friend of his had once been in a really bad spot and asked Lee if he could borrow his good luck for six weeks. Lee said OK, and handed it over (I don't know how). At the end of the six weeks, it had apparently worked so well that he didn't want to give it back, but Lee forced him to (again I don't know how). 

At this point I became aware that I was sitting in a car with either a madman or a wizard, and it mostly depended on whether or not I believed in magic. 

I suspended my disbelief and let my curiosity come back forward, and asked him what I really wanted to know ""Why do you think you have such good luck?""

He smiled because he knew he'd got me hooked and he said ""you want to know?""

I said ""yes, I do."" 

He said ""I've talked to strangers all my life.""

Throughout the rest of my life, the words ""good luck comes from talking with strangers"" is the only advice I've ever remembered to follow. When he said that, I had to acknowledge that at the same time that I had huge resistance to opening up to strangers, causing me great anxiety, I also benefited hugely from every time I did so, and it wouldn't be inaccurate to call it ""good luck"". I feel more in tune with myself when I talk with strangers, I find new opportunities, I just feel like I'm living in a better world when I realise that the person sitting next to me on the (yikes) metro or at the (scary) bar laughs at the same silly joke that I like. But I only find it out through exploration.

I'm not offering advice to anybody on this sreddit because I know we find our own small quiet consistent ways that work for us no matter what grand advice comes parading through our daily thoughts, but I thought the story might come in handy.

I have physical anxiety. For the past few months it had been almost non-existent, but it's back in force again after a panic attack I had last week. My body is out of equilibrium, which has caused a lot of episodes of panic, as well as extreme fatigue, brain fog, wanting to cry my eyes out, etc. I've overcome this once before, though, without medications. In fact, I was prescribed Hydroxyzine today, took 5 mg and felt even more brain fog and nervousness. I snapped out of it, but the symptoms are still lingering. I feel compelled to share what helped me get through this last time, because this time I was too quick to jump to meds. 

-- Try to help solve someone else's problem: The worst times of anxiety are when you feel like you can't escape your own head. The entire universe feels like it exists between your ears--that's the number one way I'll describe it with people. If you have a friend you think is going through something, talk to them. Not only do you distract your brain from anxiety, but you also feel good and sharp. 

-- Do something creative: Graphic design was always my niche. Whenever I'm doodling my mind relaxes and focuses. Just like with talking to people, whenever you can do something highly functional with your own mind, you realize how much of it is still really there. Sometimes I'll do this for hours, and the results make me so proud that I get focused on that--not my anxiety.

-- DO NOT GOOGLE YOUR SYMPTOMS: I cannot stress this enough. The first few things that will pop up on any google search are usually worst-case scenarios. When I first had anxiety I had neck and head pressure, scalp burning, vertigo, diziness, panic attacks, etc. The first thing that came up on Google search was some guy thinking he had some unknown disease...he let it ruin his life. Every. Symptom. I had. I freaked the fuck out. Turns out, these people are simply hypochondriacs who have failed to deal with their problems constructively. You can convince yourself of having anything if you try hard enough. Nothing is more reassuring than seeing a medical professional and having them simply smile at you sand say, ""You've got anxiety. It's tough, but it's not the end of the world. Stay calm."" Whenever I feel compelled to google my symptoms I remind myself of how my doctors have shared laughs with me during discussions--reassuring that what I have is temporary and can be dealt with. 

-- Talk to yourself. Or be funny: I've been blessed with a pretty joking personality. A lot of times, if I'm driving and feeling anxious, I'll just start making really stupid, ambiguous noises. Ironic, because it would appear to the people on the outside that I'm losing my mind, but in the end it helps me remind myself I'm still here. 

-- Exercise: One of the best things I ever did was start a daily walk/jog up and down the mountain next to my house. Giving your body somewhere else to dispose of energy makes a huge difference!

-- Eat right: Tuna, blue berries, bananas, non-fried chicken, rice, cereals and trail mix. Chocolate is actually decent too. Avoid excess caffeine. 

-- Whatever anyone says, don't drink or smoke: This may be controversial, but both of my bad anxiety episodes were sparked by substance abuse. First it was alcohol, then it was marijauna. Both caused panic attacks for me. 

-- Sleep schedule! 

-- Herbal tea: Kava seems to help my body relax at night. 

-- Sing: I do karaoke twice a week. When I do karaoke, my anxiety is gone. Singing is fun, and again helps get the mind out of the funky zone. 

-- Talk to friends about it. Get your anxiety in the open. Not being open about your anxiety can actually make you feel more stuck in your own head, which causes more stress. 

-- Remember, you're fine. There's a lot of people out there who have terminal diseases. Yours is not one of them.",,False,,t5_2qmij,False,,,True,t3_1etgxc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1etgxc/my_personal_steps_for_overcoming_anxiety/,

I've had anxiety since August 2010 and have been reading and using various non-medication methods.  I do have Xanax (.25mg) for the times that it's bad and I'm down to only needing it about once a month for a really bad day.  Last week, my doctor prescribed Lexapro and last Sunday, I took one 10mg of Lexapro.  Usually the anxiety builds up before a full blown panic attack so I haven't had one since last November because I have learned to control the anxiety.  But that medicine threw me into a panic attack immediately with no anxiety build up.  Along with other side effects, it had me in bed for about 3 days.  I did not take any more of that medicine because 1. my reaction and 2. my doctor told me to stop.

Now that the medicine has fully cleared my system, I wanted to go to Office Depot this morning, my first time driving in a week.  I drive and a block away from the store, I freak and go home.  Then I saw my electricity bill that I have to mail off today.  I put on my jacket again, grab the bill and realize that I cannot walk **one** block to the post office.

After trying my various methods to calm down, I realize today is my once a month day that I will need the Xanax.  I walk into my bedroom where I keep some by the bed (placebo effect makes me sleep well knowing it's close by).  Then I start crying because I don't want to take it. I don't want to rely on medication. I want to be stronger because I know I can overcome this and one day I will be fine.  

Then I got mad.  And I mean pissed off, cursing like a sailor mad.  I throw my jacket on, grab the bill, grab my keys and storm out the door.  The entire time I am stomping down the block, I am cursing under my breath.  This bill HAS to be mailed today.  It's the electric bill.  If the electricity gets turned off because of this damn anxiety, well what the fuck?!  No baseball, no tv, no internet, can't apply for jobs if no internet, can't cook, food will spoil.  Fuck this anxiety!  It's thrown me to the hospital and doctor's office more times in the past 8 months than I've been to see my doctor in the past 10 years!  I had to take a leave of absence from school, I'm thousands in debt (and that is **after** insurance), I finally paid off one ambulance, now I have to work on the second one.  I'm still paying for those doctor visits from last October and many more after.  Fuck you anxiety!  Fuck you.  You're holding me back from going to the store.  I am tired of being in my apartment!  I was able to walk to the library a few days ago.  I went to the post office the other day.  And today you want to rear your ugly head that I can't even go **one** block?!  I AM TIRED OF YOU HOLDING ME BACK.  Fuck you anxiety!  Fuck you brain!

By now I'm passing a group of people for the second time who are standing outside a building.  When I get pass them, I begin to laugh and realize I look like a crazy ass person.  Stomping down the street, face red from crying, cursing under my breath pretty loudly at myself.  Even now, an hour later, I'm still laughing at myself.

I honestly cannot remember the last time I have ever been pissed off. Everything I've read so far has been to be calm, have patience and accept the feelings.  I've been doing that for eight months and I don't know what snapped, but today, I said fuck it, fuck anxiety.

I'm off to Office Depot, because fuck it, I want to use my $5 rewards and get some free stuff and get out the apartment!

Something about focusing on the breath and the feeling of belly breathing in and out just totally overwhelms my anxiety with calm, and I feel much better.

The way to do this:

1. When you have a feeling of anxiety coming on, pause and notice it. Tell yourself ""I feel anxiety/panic/etc. coming on.""

2. Take a moment and put your awareness, focus your attention, on your belly.

3. Begin to draw in a breath into the belly. Keep your attention on the sensation of the breath going in. The depth of the breath is not as important as focusing on the sensation of breathing. It is better to breathe slowly rather than quickly, however this can take time if you are feeling serious panic building. It might take you a few breaths to work up to slow breathing, but give it a chance. 

4. Exhale slowly. If you can, extend the exhale, and then pause (briefly) at the end of the breath.

5. Repeat (at least) 4 times more. The trick is to keep your awareness on the sensation of breathing, on the feeling of your belly moving in and out. You will notice when you are panic breathing that your breathing takes place in your chest, not your belly. There is a physiological response with shallow breathing that increases the likelihood of an anxiety attack. Use some more breaths if 5 isn't enough. Five is somewhat of a magic number, though, and it works pretty much every time for me.

I swear takes me to a different state of mind every time. Just one more tool in your toolbox. Good luck out there!

I can talk to strangers fine, and I love meeting new people, but after hanging out with someone three times or hanging out with people I know for years I get ultra nervous about what they think of me.  I think they think I'm stupid, boring, negative and rude, and I clam up.  I don't want to share anything about me or express myself naturally.  It's easier with a stranger.

An example - this weekend my cousins had a party.  I grew up with them, I visit them a few times a year.  They're very nice and great at asking insightful questions about people's lives and showing interest, but I still have a hard time talking to them.  I'm different than them, it makes me feel like an outsider - I'm the 'artist' of the family.  I'm very quiet, I never say enough.  They seemed a little surprised I was able to make friends at the party and chat up a storm, and remarked that they would have been sitting in a corner sulking at a party with no one they knew.

I worry a lot about not doing enough to help out, and not doing enough for myself.  I feel like a child when I'm around them, the attitude of their households is my home is your home ... but when I'm helping them clean after the party I don't know where things go, how they like things done or where the cleaning supplies are.  It makes me hesitant to help out, and hesitant to put a lot of effort into things.  I often go hungry while I'm visiting because I'm too nervous to find something to eat or let them know I need to eat.  I would love to cook for them, I'm a good cook and food is great for bonding, but when I think about asking them to take me to the grocery store and paying for food I feel it isn't worth it.  I didn't get mix for my vodka for the party because I was too nervous to drop into a store.  My brain shuts off.

When my problem started to get bad, around 16/17 (I am 22 this year) I was having a terrible time. I looked on the internet and that seemed to make it worse, everything would set it off. I realised it's just a bad thought pattern, I would worry about something and go around in circles in my mind over and over whilst the anxious feeling would get stronger. So I said to myself I have to break those thought circles... As soon as a negative thought would come up I chose to ignore it, move on to a different thought. At first this was hard... I was basically reprogramming how I thought but after a few weeks of this my problems basically disappeared. I started smoking weed a lot more with friends and just having a good time, something I would never have been able to do. 
Why am I posting here if I am over my problems? well to be honest anxiety is something that will never go, you just have to learn to deal with it.

It was from being bullied quite terribly to the point where I didn't eat/sleep/leave the house or leave my bed for that matter. I was in a relationship for two years, and he was amazing with the anxiety and panic attacks, at one point we were so serious we moved in together and at that time I was dealing with at minimum four panic attacks a day. 

After our relationship ended, I was the lowest I had ever felt and decided to finally seek treatment for this disorder, unfortunately no one around me really understood what I was going through, I wish I had reddit at the time to maybe do something like this, better late then never though I hope. So after almost a year of server therapy (which is by the way the hardest thing I ever did and ever will do) I finally stopped being anxious all the time, getting panic attacks, 99% of my social anxiety was gone, I was the most strong I'd ever felt, it sucked that because my friends didn't understand what anxiety really did to me and my mind it wasn't as celebrated as I expected it to be, anyway I should've been doing everything I couldn't do whilst I was dealing with this disorder, but my ex was leading me on for this entire time and the other week all of a sudden he stopped all communication and also started saying really mean things to me about anxiety too, this coming from the person two weeks ago that said ""I love you I want to be with you for the rest of my life."" 

Basically since then anxiety has come roaring back into my life, I'm feeling uneasy all the time, I keep feeling like I need to ground myself or grab onto something, I'm shaky and definitely dealing with a lot of anxiety related thoughts/pains. I'm also feeling pretty defeated to be honest, I mean I thought it was over, but I guess because he was my comfort zone and he was supposed to be there, anxiety is the only other form of comfort I have. 

I apologise for the length but if anyone is feeling bored and wants to give some advice, anything like that is appreciated because really right now all I feel is lost and I don't feel like I'm strong enough to get through it all over again.

They've left me completely on edge and exhausted all day long every day.

Today, I decided to educate myself and read a lot about anxiety and other people's experiences. Sometimes that's hard for me to do because thinking/reading about anxiety often GIVES me anxiety. I constantly find myself unable to convince myself that nothing is wrong with me, I'm constantly paranoid that something bad is happening/going to happen, that I'm going to die or something is wrong in one way or another. I did a lot of research on fight or flight response and how/when my triggers take effect. I get anxiety while driving, I get anxiety when I'm hungover, I get anxiety when I'm tired or didn't get enough sleep, I get anxiety when someone texts me a paragraph text while I'm driving and I can't read it or respond. I get anxiety when I can't type a text fast enough. I get anxiety when I write in my journal for a long period of time. I get anxiety that I'm going to get anxious around people and people will see me act crazy. I get anxiety when I think about my friends. I get anxiety when I think about my exbest friend and my exboyfriend. I get anxiety when I'm working and I'm scared that I'll get dizzy and crash into someone. I've done a lot of research and I thought I had social anxiety, driving anxiety, I thought I was a hypochondriac, I thought I had claustrophobia, I always think if I've drank the night before that I'm having alcohol withdrawals or I'm super unhealthy, that my ADHD medication is the reason for anxiousness (even though it's never ever been a problem in my 10 years of being on it)... but because I've thought ALL of those things and I relate to each and every single one of those and I know it's unlikely it's ALL of them, I've discovered that it might just be more specific than that. I've narrowed it down and think that I've discovered that what I have is [anticipatory anxiety](http://panicdisorder.about.com/od/symptoms/a/anticianxiety.htm). This means that all of those thoughts/symptoms that I have that fall under each of those categories are all just me anticipating/worrying the worst in each situation. I anticipate and worry in ALL of them.

For the first time I don't feel as crazy. I've read so many of your guy's posts and responses and can relate to ALL of you. For me, this whole anxiety/panic attack thing for the last year and 6 months has left me feeling so alone and different from anyone. I always thought no one understood me and therefore I felt completely lost. For once, I feel like I'm not lost. I feel more confident that I'm going to be okay. That if I have a panic attack, it's going to be okay.

Reading about the ""[Fight or Flight Response](http://www.thebodysoulconnection.com/EducationCenter/fight.html)"" really helped me put my anxiety and my constant ""worrying"" into perspective. I encourage you all read this from time to time, and THINK hard about it and let it be comforting to you that your body is doing this to try to protect you, not hurt you. Try to make yourself believe that worrying about your body doing this to you is what's making your body do that to you. You should accept that your body does this because it's an amazing, complex and beautiful thing. You're body knows how to save itself when you let your mind play a trick on it. You're not crazy. You just have a hard time sometimes. I'm not crazy. I just struggle with my thoughts. I feel for you all, you're not alone. 

I'm deciding right now that I'm going to pick myself up. I'm going to do things for myself that make me feel good and not worry when I'm doing them. I'm going to shower every morning and get ready/do my makeup, straighten or curl my hair EVEN if I'm not going anywhere and don't have anything to do. I'm going to make my bed after I get up, I'm going to give myself manicures and pedicures when I'm bored.. I'm going to floss more, I'm going to hang up my paintings in my room, I'm going to wear lipgloss and not feel like I'm ""wasting"" it because no one is seeing me with it on. I'm going to do all these things.. and it's going to feel nice.

I know it's illogical to be anxious about other people's impressions of me, and that I don't (or shouldn't) care what people I don't even know think of me, and then I realised that that wasn't the source of the fear.

I'm not scared of someone thinking that I'm a nervous or pathetic individual, or judging me badly, but what I am scared of is the idea that their judgement could be right. (Which is obviously stupid.)

I think I've watched too much TV. You see these characters with their whole persona and life story displayed on their face, in their body language, and how people react to them. Maybe if I'm coming across as an anxious, pathetic person to other people in real life then that will define who I am as a person.

I need to realize that we're not shallow characters on TV, and what other people think of me doesn't matter not just because I don't need to care what they think, but because even if they do judge me badly that doesn't define me as a person.

I just thought of this and it made me feel great, can anyone else relate to similar fear or realization?

Also it's worth mentioning that while part of me thinks I don't care what everyone thinks, it's important not to care that you actually do care a bit what people think of you.

Where is the advice, the progress reports, solutions, etc?

In my years of dealing with anxiety, I've found that the more you think about it, the more you focus on it, and the more you fight it, the worse it gets. I've found that yoga/meditation have worked wonders for me in helping me develop a more mindful worldview outside of the completely limiting, self-centric one that anxiety locks people into. It trains you to see things for what they are, instead of through a lens of fear. 

Anyway, what I wanted to know was have any anxiety-sufferers here conquered it to the point where they reasonably feel like they are getting the things they want out of life and are living up to their potential? For me, personally, I feel like I am not doing what I want in life, whatever I do is never good enough, and that I will never live up to my potential. It's one of my greatest fears, and it would help to hear from someone who has beaten it. For the vast majority of us, out of all friends, family, colleagues, etc it is very difficult to find people IRL to relate to the plight of people with anxiety.

Also I've been looking into getting some meds, like Xanax. What are people's experiences with it?

1338669508.0,27,self.Anxiety,uhmfd,Stop wishing for your legs back: anxiety and acceptance,mileshigh_23,29,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/uhmfd/stop_wishing_for_your_legs_back_anxiety_and/,"I just got done meditating, and I had a realization about my anxiety, and anxiety in general. I understand each of us has our own unique life and experience with anxiety; my intent is not to prescribe some miracle solution to anxiety for everyone, though I believe this is one powerful tool and attitude toward gaining ultimate peace.

Here's an analogy to explain this realization. If a person loses both their legs, they are probably going to be very bummed about  it. They could spend the rest of their lives in sorrow wishing they had both their legs back. But the fact is, they're never gunna get the things back (save for possibly cyborg legs in the distant future... which would be pretty awesome)!  On the other hand, if they accept this reality, that their legs are long gone, they can live with this dilemma, but still move on to enjoy all the wonderful things that life has to offer. Case in point: I went to high school with a guy that got drunk and passed out on some train tracks. He lost both legs and an arm. To this day, this guy is one of the happiest guys I've ever met. His legs and arm are not conditions for him to be happy.


With this line of thinking, many of us have set a condition for us to be happy: we will be happy once we get our peace back, and until we do, life sucks! Stop fighting anxiety. Stop wishing for your legs back. The real issue is not the anxiety, it's the judgement of the anxiety that perpetuates it. It's feeling the slightest bit of tension (which is totally human), and then your mind making it 10x worse because ""I shouldn't feel this way.""


The funny thing is, once you adopt an attitude of acceptance, your anxiety tends to disappear. But if you go into it with an attitude of, ""I accept this feeling, now why won't it go away!"", it's ineffective. Learn to accept anxiety like an old friend every time it arrives. Attacking the root of anxiety is to wholeheartedly accept it. Trying to consciously will acceptance into your life isn't very effective (at least in my experience), and for that, I highly recommend checking out /r/meditation.",,False,,t5_2qmij,1338754123.0,,,True,t3_uhmfd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/uhmfd/stop_wishing_for_your_legs_back_anxiety_and/,

I am a 20 year old female student struggling with anxiety (social anxiety)I thought I'd share some changes I've seen in my life. It's far from over, But I know I've come a long way with my social anxiety. 

I used to never be able to leave my house unless someone was with me. I lost so many beautiful days to anxiety. 

I developed an eating disorder at 10 years old because of social anxieties and fought with it until the beginning of college.

Teachers and councilors thought I was mute up until high school.

I lost my only friend because of my clingyness. Depending on her for so much must have been a heavy burden. Seeing her in the streets truly embarrasses me- I was such a horrible friend. 

I hated myself so much. I cut, starved, and puked because of who I was. I would sleep on the bathroom, garage, or attic floor and ended up with lice at 15 years old.  
I was a disappointment and budren for my mother. 

I never once talked to my college roommates, instead I locked myself in my room and wasted those beautiful days away. 

I would take sleeping pills to make the time go by faster. 

I think one of my lowest points was when one of the roommates had friends over. I had to go to the bathroom, but was too afraid to leave the room so instead pissed into a pad and threw it out when they left. It might not be the worst, but even then I knew how low I had fallen. I felt sub-human not even being able to reach a bathroom. 

But I think I've changed quite a lot in the past 2 years. I'm not sure what caused such a drastic change in such a short time, but in comparison, I can definitely see it. 

I can now go to stores on my own. :)

I can now go to a public gym. :) 

I can now eat in public. :)

I can now leave my home alone. :)

I can now talk to some people and keep eye contact. :)

I say thank you to cars that stop for me. :)

I've called friends. :)

I've talked to strangers. :)

I've made new friends. :)

I've talked when in group work at school. :)

I say ""Thank you"" to my bus driver. :)

I walk 30 minutes to class everyday through the city. :)


I still hesitate when I leave my house or head to the gym. I still find it hard to keep a conversation going and to keep eye contact. I still find it hard to smile at strangers, but I think I've come a long way. :)

First of all, I want to say that I see many of you are unhappy with your therapeutic programs and your prescriptions. I completely understand, I tried 2 counselors, 1 psychiatrist, and countless medications (prescribed and illicit) to no avail. Finally, last year, I found an awesome CBT clinic for panic and anxiety disorders nearby, and it has COMPLETELY changed my life. I recommend you all do some research on local CBT clinics (they are, unfortunately, not incredibly easy to find).
So, the Behavioral part of CBT involves creating a hierarchy of ""Exposures"", which are situations characteristic of those that cause you severe anxiety, ranked in order from least-anxiety-provoking and least-likely-to-avoid to most-anxiety-provoking and most-likely-to-avoid. Your task is to start doing these exposures (often times as role-plays in the safety of your therapist's office) until you retrain your brain to realize that you aren't in danger (it's more complicated than that, but I'm sure you're already sick of reading). I am scheduled to give a presentation about myself tomorrow in class, which is my absolute highest-end exposure. A year ago I wouldn't even be thinking about doing this. Tonight I feel pretty capable, a manageable amount of nervousness, and a tiny bit of excitement to do it.
Really guys, I suggest looking into CBT. Even if there isn't a clinic nearby, there are tons of great workbooks that will walk you through the process. Sometimes people are 100% successful doing it themselves.
Thanks for reading, this subreddit has also provided a major space for me to feel comfortable and not so crazy. I truly appreciate that. 

TL; DR: read the title

UPDATE: I just got back from the class I had to present in, and it went AWESOMELY! I volunteered to go first, something I'd never have done in the past. I was nearly puking with nerves beforehand, my anticipatory anxiety is always horrible, but as I got into it I started to habituate and the whole thing went incredibly well.

So awhile back I posted for support because I was about to take my test and I get crippling nerves over several things, and driving is one of them.

Anyway, I couldn't take it that day so I made an appointment for today. Well the lady at the front desk was SO nice, but even so, I was still nervous. I thought I could get through it but it took so long waiting. By the time I got to a different lady who takes my photo, I could feel it coming on. ""Oh, this poor lady doesn't know what she's about to witness."" I tried a breathing exercise I learned in Psychology class and it held the tears back, but my nerves were still on fire.

She asked me how many times I've taken the the test, and I said 3 or 4, couldn't really recall. A few minutes later she told me it was actually 6(!) Her voice got really low, and she asked me what was wrong. ""Oh no, we're gonna talk about feelings, and she doesn't deserve this."" I said everything. She took a few seconds and asked if I got really nervous. I nodded, then bit my lip, and started crying. I smiled at her a little to try to let her know I was ok, and because I knew this was going to happen. I said I was sorry, ""This must be really weird for you, some girl crying,"" trying so hard to keep from just sobbing loudly then and there, embarrassing her/putting her in a difficult position.

She was SO nice and understanding. I normally get kinda offended when people say ""Just don't be nervous,"" but when she said it.... She was like a motherly-figure in this moment and I wanted to make her proud. She told me what to do (pull around back, park in no parking zone), but through the tears I didn't understand so I asked her to repeat. She told me to get up and that she would show me (awww so sweet :,)) The nice old lady at the front desk looked concerned when we went. After we went outside and she showed me, I told her thank you. I honestly didn't expect her to be so understanding, because I figured she must get a lot of teenage girls crying.

She told me I could have my grandpa sit in the car with me until the instructor showed up, so I did. At first he thought they wouldn't let me take the test because I was clearly still upset by the time I went back in and got him. (He was with me another time this happened, but my mom was there too and she just made it worse. Poppaw made me feel better by not putting any pressure on me to calm down). Well a few minutes later another woman finally showed and it was the instructor. Poppaw made a joke with her, and it set the mood a little lighter, enough for small talk until we got started.

[We're gonna skip 99% of the test] My foot still had it's little seizure on the pedal, I thought I would get in trouble for it. The lady was nice I could tell, so if I felt I mis-understood/heard her, I recited what she said back to her.

At the end of the test, she said I did good. That still doesn't mean I passed, so I kept listening. (She said I went over pedestrian lines a little, and turned my wheels the wrong way on the curb.) As she was getting out, I asked if I passed, and she said yes! I then rambled about how she's the best instructor ever (cringe). My poppaw was right outside the car, so he made some talk with her and I saw her mouth the words that I passed. He got up to my side of the car and I had this HUGE grin on my face. Then we hugged.

I went back inside and stood at the front desk. I saw the photo lady from where I was and she saw me. She mouthed ""Did you get it?"" HUGE grin and mouthed ""Yes I got it!"" She gave me a thumbs up, and told me to have a seat. The old lady from the front desk saw our little circle of smiles and giggles and joined in lol. They were really nice, I couldn't have asked for better people to be there. The photo lady told me congrats but I was still twitching and she was like, ""Well you already have it now!"" I was just like ""I know, I dunno what's wrong with me! (lol)""

Anyway, I'm really happy right now. Me and Poppaw got some BK milkshakes and went home (he drove, he knew I was still freaking out). Ah, it was a good day.",,False,,t5_2qmij,False,,,True,t3_1kdfrq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1kdfrq/hey_guys_i_just_got_my_license/,

I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety order a few years ago but I've had it all my life, usually manifesting as a constant state of worry, ocd tendencies and constant feelings of failure. 

I have a 3.9 GPA on a 4.0 scale, am editor-in-chief of my campus newspaper, am working this summer for a very well known national newspaper and also a small-time community paper. It's my dream to be a journalist but it's so damn stressful. 

No matter how much I realize I need to start writing ASAP, I worry and stress out and procrastinate, and all these feelings compound on top of each other until I'm a curled up heap of nerves. I've made it through the summer okay so far, but I keep finding myself increasingly fucked each week. 
I sometimes wish I had a shit job where nobody would talk to me, like a night janitor or something, so I could do my thing, make money, and pursue my passions on the side. But I'm talented and have a killer resume. Everyone has high hopes for me, including myself, but I'm scared success won't be fulfilling. I fight off nihilistic feelings daily. 

A big part of this anxiety is that I'm scared to death of graduating. This is the last year I'll have any semblance of a childhood. I don't know who I am anymore, much less who I'm going to be. I feel like so much of my identity is based on being a young person, and now that it's time to be a responsible adult, I'm scared of losing who I am. This is a life transition that scares the living shit out of me. 

And finally, to top it off, feeling this way and procrastinating myself into a shit hole every week makes me feel incredibly lazy, irresponsible, and undeserving of the opportunities that have been given to me. I'm so tired of feeling guilty and scared and anxious and like a crappy human in general.

1364245932.0,25,self.Anxiety,1azxq4,First post. And guess what? I'm anxious about it ...,JonnyRadical,28,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1azxq4/first_post_and_guess_what_im_anxious_about_it/,"Here's what's up:

I'll be 28 in June, I have a beautiful wife and three gorgeous daughters who all basically worship the ground I walk on (not to brag or anything). But every night when I come home from work, I'm full of anxiety about facing them. 

In December 2012, I lost a steady, great paying job of 2 years to ""downsizing"". I have since found employment, but it's not the same. It's through a placement agency, which has caused me nothing but stress, and the pay isn't even close. But it's something to survive on and I know that, but something deep inside of me feel its not enough. 
As a result of losing my last job, I fell behind on a lot of bills, car insurance included. It ended up being cancelled. I worked out a deal, however and thought all was going well after mailing in my small first payment. Wrong. They never received it, and it's caused me so much anxiety, I completely shut it out, forgetting all about it. My wife asks me about it often, and I have mini panic attacks every time. 

Basically, what I'm trying to say is I'm anxious of facing my anxiety. It's affecting my relationship with my wife and kids, causing me more anxiety. I so desperately want help, but again, I'm afraid I may have another panic attack. 

All this anxiety stems from ( what used to be) a small case of Agoraphobia - the fear of large crowds or open spaces (large crowds for me) and its gotten worse as I've gotten older. I had a panic attack in fucking Costco of all places.

TL;DR - I'm panicking about everything, and it's worsening over time. I want help, but I'm too anxious to seek it out. It's ruining my marriage and I'm becoming a less attentive father because of it.

I don’t suffer from anxiety / panic attacks, but my wife does. She’s been having them for 10 years, and has recently started SSRI’s for the third time. She had been having some success controlling symptoms with Mindfulness techniques, but she’s in a stressful job, and it recently got the better of her.  

The first few days’ ‘loading dose’ of SSRIs affect her badly, and she’s been off work for a week or so now. This is obviously terrible for her, as I’m sure you all know, but it’s pretty hard on me too. The problem is that I feel really petty in admitting this; my problems are nothing compared to hers.  To be honest, I feel bad admitting this here, too, but I wanted to at least let it out anonymously. 

Obviously, I can’t say anything to her about how I feel. If she knew the strain the whole situation is putting on me, she’d worry about that, and probably try to hide it. This only ever results in the built-up emotion escaping further down the line, and that never works out well. So I stay quiet. I have to be the strong one: I take stuff on so she doesn’t need to worry about it, and can concentrate on herself. Silly things sometimes, but this weekend, I didn’t get a chance to sit down for a minute, I had to do all the chores and errands. Now, obviously, I do these things unthinkingly, unhesitatingly, freely, and gladly. There’s no question, and I seek nothing in return. But it’s not easy. Even the sex – yes, SSRIs hit your sex life, but by association, they hit your partner too. You feel like a real selfish asshole admitting this, so you keep that quiet too, but, man, it sucks. 

It’s heartbreaking seeing someone you love so much living in such torment. But you can’t show the heartbreak. You want to leap in there, and take it away, but you will be forever excluded from her mind (and that’s a whole other existential / epistemological can of worms). It’s strangely distancing, but I’m so thankful that at least none of this has ever put a strain on our relationship. It’s still unshakeable. In fact, it has to be: when you don’t know what you are doing, or where you are going – there is always this fixed point of reference. Us, and our love.  

But everything else? Well, I don’t have a clue. I am a *de facto* counselor, a sympathetic ear. But I’m not trained in any of this. How am I supposed to know if I’m doing the right thing, and what if I inadvertently make it worse? I can sit and listen quietly, maybe prompt with a question to get her to talk. That’s good, right? But what if it isn’t? What if sometimes, this is just ‘indulging’ her? I know sometimes she needs a bit of tough love. This weekend, I had to insist that she get up, and we take the dogs for a long, tiring walk along the beach. This was the right thing to do, but last week, I tried to insist that she get up and go for a swim, and this just stressed her out more. I messed up. Set her back when I was trying to help. Same situation, same approach, different results.  

So I try and get to learn her moods, to know when to push her forward, when to shut up and listen. At the end of the day, I just fall into that same old ‘guy’ trap of seeing a problem, and trying to fix it. Only it never works like that, least of all here. It’s compounded by the fact that not only can I never get inside her head and understand, but this state of mind is so far beyond my comprehension that it’s not funny. After 6 months of doing the Mindfulness meditations, she had a realisation: the state of mind she was trying to achieve was basically the state she thought I spend my whole life in. I’m normally calm and unflustered, able to react calmly. Of course she doesn't know that that’s not strictly true, and I hate the fact that I’m not being completely open. I just don’t feel I have a choice.  

So yeah, I guess that’s it. I really don’t know what I’m hoping to achieve from this, and I'm sorry for rambling. I do feel better for writing it, but I surprised myself by how difficult it was to do. I did need to take a couple of breaks to have a quiet weep.

I am so sick of my lack of peer companionship. I had decided that this fall would be different. I pushed through my anxiety and started inviting people to hang out. I only have a handful of casual-but-friendly acquaintances and friends-of-friends in this area, but friendships have to start somewhere, right?


Despite my anxiety, shyness, and substantial hatred of rejection (seriously... I stopped dating 9 years ago and haven't made a new friend since my junior year of college), I managed to send out a facebook message inviting people to come see a movie with me. I got several polite turn-downs (working late, already have plans, promised to visit grandma, etc) and a few no replies. Many of the polite turn-downs included a ""thanks for thinking of me, and let me know the next time you do something like this.""  Not bad at all, right?

The next week, I tried again with dinner. Same result, only with more ignores and only one ""ask me again next time!""s.  I gave it a few weeks and tried it again with coffee. Ditto. Failure.

A few weeks after *that*, I picked an activity that I thought would appeal to four of the people who'd responded before, and I only invited the four of them to join me. I got four polite no's.


I have received 0 invitations back. Nobody is into hanging out with me.


I can't do this again. I am totally deflated. I have no idea why I even bothered to TRY to make friends. Everyone left me before, and these new people would also eventually leave me, and this whole thing is a waste of time and a guaranteed way to feel left out and alone. People get married and move far away. People have kids and want to raise them somewhere with more museums or closer to their in-laws. I am here, alone, and I was doing a wonderful job of accepting that. 


I just really hate myself right now. I was okay, I was stable, I was happy, and then I had to go and mess everything up. Now instead of feeling comfortable with my solitary life, I feel rejected and inferior and alone.

I'm usually my worst critic. In fact I'm too hard on myself. 

This past while I've been dealing with pretty bad anxiety and depression. I don't know where it came from or why at this stage in my life (late 20's) it decided to show up. But fuck it, it's here and I'm doing my best to deal with it.

So anyway, tonight I had a first date. Now, normally I would have a few drinks before such an occasion - the old dutch courage, if you will - because I'm normally nervous in these situations. Add the anxiety on top of that and this makes dealing with nervous situations like this even worse.

But I said: Fuck it, I'm not going to drink. Whatever happens tonight I'm not going to drink. I'm gonna feel what I'm gonna feel and I'm not gonna dull it with alcohol. Feeling nervous is okay. I'm okay.

I told myself: Who cares if you have an anxiety attack? Make this the worst date ever and have fun. Don't put pressure on yourself that everything has to go well. Make it the worst date ever and have fun.

This is just a mental trick I've started to learn. I tell myself that it's okay to be bad at stuff and it usually relaxes me.

Long story short, the date went great. I have really sore shoulders now because of the stress and anxiety during it, but I never felt like drinking once. Drinking was my safety blanket. Now I'm glad it's gone and I can experience being alive without feeling the need to dull my feelings.

It's like I'm saying to the world, this is me. I'm nervous and anxious and stressed but I'm okay. These feelings are okay.

Tonight was a big deal for me. I'm making sure that the new me takes time to appreciate myself and I just wanted to share it with someone.

There were a few times where I felt the anxiety rise and I thought an anxiety attack was coming but I tried my best just to let go. And you know what? It never materialised. Not once. And, although I can't guarantee it, I'm petty sure my date never paid one bit of heed to it.

Anxiety is the wizard behind the curtain, it's all smoke and mirrors. I have to learn to stand my ground and allow the feelings to be, just be, without judging them, without wishing them away. Because if I challenge the anxious thoughts, the panicky thoughts, the thoughts of impending doom, then anxiety turns out to be a con - it doesn't deliver.

And all I needed to do was find it.

I went back downstairs, lay on the ground some more, and found it in the shadows.  But i could not reach it.   So i checked in my car for something I could use to extend my reach, and Found my son's toy Darth Vader lightsaber.

I won't lie, we've had a tough go at things due to my jealous ex boyfriend, but other than that, things have been amazing between us.

Saturday, he called and said he wanted to go look into buying some hookahs and asked me to go with him. I told him I would as soon as I got done eating, which would be in 30 minutes. I called him as I was walking out the door 30 minutes later and he had already left without me and was already at the store. He said he didn't want it to get too late and miss out on being able to go. 

I was irritated, but held my tongue. After that, he said he wanted to stop by a friends house for 10 minutes and then he would pick me up so we could go out. I waited for an hour or more and then called him. He was still at his friends house, so I told him to stay and we would hang out tomorrow morning. 

He said he would come get me so we could go to church together.

Sunday morning, I get up, get ready, and he never showed, or called. I went into a panic at this point and my mind was going over stuff like 'Well he's mad at you, he doesn't want to be with you, that's why he didn't spend time with you yesterday, etc."" Vicious cycle and all that.

I tried to stay rational and thought that maybe he had just over slept and didn't set an alarm or something. He lives less than 5 minutes away so I drove by his house. His car wasn't there. More panic.

Later, he calls me and says that it was because he was helping someone do something, lost track of time, and had left his phone at home so he couldn't call me. He knows I have an anxiety disorder and said he knew I would be upset. I told him how I felt and that this kind of thing, where he says he's going to do something and doesn't, can't keep happening. 

He thinks that I'm overreacting, that I have trust issues with him, and that I need to get ahold of my anxiety. He says he understands that I have problems but he doesn't want to deal with me 'freaking out' and 'getting emotional' on him, because it 'happens every week over nothing' and that it's 'scaring him away.' 

Guys, I am terrified. I honestly feel like my anxiety is taking over my life. I wouldn't wish how I feel on my worst enemy. I'm in therapy, on medication, and doing everything I can on my own but it's going to cause me to lose someone I care about so much and I just don't know what to do. Any advice?

Deep pressure is often used for individuals with autism or behaviour problems to help calm themselves. This can be from a weighted blanket or vest for example. However, it something that we all can use!
Pressure sends signals to your brain that help it regulate and calm down. Love the feeling of being under a heavy blanket or a great hug? That's why!
Some great ways to incorporate it are crawling under a heavy blanket, rubbing someone firmly on the back or arm, carrying heavy objects/backpack, or even pressing your feet down into the floor (great when in a waiting room to help you focus before an important meeting).

Here is the LPT thread, the comments have other ways to get deep pressure.

So I've been seeing a therapist for the last few months. It used to be a weekly session but I had trouble keeping all the appointments (it was an early morning appointment and one of my main problems is getting to sleep) so I got downgraded to once a fortnight. In the last session she said that she felt like I was giving excuses for everything and not really trying, so she was thinking that we should stop the therapy. Which I was kinda annoyed about at the time, but I think I mostly felt like I didn't really like the things she was suggesting to me and I didnt want to do them. So I realised it was probably my fault for being resistant and decided to get stuck in a bit more. 

So this week I did several of the things we agreed, like going to the shop to get my phone fixed (it's been broken for like 6 months and I've been too nervous to go to the shop for it). I was quite positive about the session and thought she'd be pleased for me that I was finally doing things she wanted me to. 

But nope, at the end of the session she said we should stop again. I think the only reason that she didn't end up cancelling the therapy last time was because I cry a lot and it makes her feel bad. It seemed like the whole point of this last session was to make sure I'm not depressed or overwhelmed or anything before she closes it off. 

To be honest, I'm not that sad about it. The last session for example was really awkward. She didn't have anything to say; she suggested that I ask my friend to go out somewhere and spent most of the time talking about different cafes in the area and giving me detailed instructions on how to get there, just to fill time. I think I just liked having someone there to report back to each week to sort of enforce some responsibility on myself, because when you're by yourself it's really easy to just drop back into push-everything-to-the-back-of-my-mind mode and not getting anything done even if you have the best intentions. I didn't really feel like she 'got' me, though, so it's probably for the best, I just feel a bit lost. I don't really feel like my anxiety has improved over the last few months, though I've been getting more 'tasks' done.

She didn't exactly just cut it off, she did ask if I want to continue, but it seemed pointless if she was just going to continually suggest that we drop it and didn't feel like she was helping me. I just don't really know what to think now. Could she just not help me? Did she think I didn't really have a problem?

Thanks for reading if you got this far, you're a better person than I :P

Anyway with this kind of logic, it can give one a different understanding on what anxiety is. I know anxiety can be very hard to control, like taming a tiger ;)

Anyway... Anxiety normally starts with a certain thought. Once you accept that thought as truth, you start creating even more relevant thoughts around that thought. So, then our subconscious starts to feel the energy of our thoughts, sorta like when you watch a action movie and you get this whole rush. Sometimes you even feel like your in that movie. And I know with anxiety it can be really hard to focus into movies... so straight to my point.

When I say think of smiling. Just think about nothing but smiling :D. Feel it, that smile. lol. You just created that emotion with your thoughts.

We are basically gods of our own thoughts, artist we are all. Eventually the anxiety gets so bad, we forget that we are the painters of our minds. So our minds begin to rule us and take over. We basically become tools of our minds. And because of the internet, our minds tend to develop the habbit of being rather active to the fast pacedness of it.

I was having this really hard day today, feeling absolutely foggy and unhappy. I dont want to use the word depressed, because once I accept it as depression it grows.

When I feel cruddy like this, a part of me say's ""Dont surf the net, simplify and try to control your thinking"". Well today I actually listened to that, so I sat, relaxed, Meditated sorta. Because it was hard to relax, I told my self (Smile, relax, tune out the world, and just be). I trusted that and stopped thinking other stuff, I just drifted off with a smile on my face.

When I opened my eyes, the energy of my room felt much more amplified, and I felt good. So I am here now to tell about it.

I was so calm it was weird, and then at that point I for sure thought I took the correct pill.

Then I get home and finally have time to google which pill was actually which, and I come to find out I actually took the Ibuprofen instead. I was completely shocked! How was that even possible?

1348121820.0,25,self.Anxiety,106il4,Thought I'd share my story and remind others that it does get better.,bucky2300,26,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/106il4/thought_id_share_my_story_and_remind_others_that/,"I've been thinking about writing this post up for some time, but I never felt that I was quite ready to write a retrospective on my time spent with anxiety. Now, however, I feel that I've reached a point of sufficient stability that such a retrospective is appropriate.

The basic goal of this post is to remind people who are currently struggling with anxiety that things *can* and *will* get better. Your path may be more or less difficult than mine was (and is!), but it is a path which will eventually see you leading a more full life than you are now. Don't succumb to your anxiety, even if it feels insurmountable. 

Anxiety entered my life when I was just starting my second year of university. I had experienced bouts of anxiety throughout my life, but had never experienced a panic attack or anything severe enough to indicate anything more than a slightly nervous disposition. Therapists would later try to find roots of my fully-blossomed anxiety in my childhood, seeking some sort of unprocessed trauma, but there was nothing to be found. To this day, I remain convinced that I simply experienced a change in my brain chemistry that had rather severe implications for how I would live my life for the next several years.

The first panic attack hit when I was out for a walk. For the previous few days I'd had a rather nasty cold, and I was still congested. Walking usually helps my sinuses clear, so I went out for a brisk walk. My first indication that something was wrong came when I realized that my heart was beating very quickly, and that I was sweatier than I should have been. I started to feel afraid. Suddenly, my body shifted into overdrive. Every nerve from my toes through the top of my head felt like it was buzzing at full strength. This, combined with the still-lingering illness, was too much, and I started to pass out. I put my head between my knees, and the world came back enough that I was able to call one of my roommates, who came to get me.

That was the first panic attack that I had. For the next four hours, I lay in bed wondering what on earth had happened to me, occasionally getting bursts of dizziness and the same sizzling feeling in my nerves. I didn't know whether I had some kind of neurological problem or not, whether or not I had experienced some kind of cardiac event, or whether it was just low blood sugar. I was terrified. 

From then on, I was perpetually nervous about having a similar attack. I noticed patterns in when the attacks would come: typically when I was alone and traveling between my house and university, or while alone at work. I also noticed that, for reasons unknown to me at that time, if I called my parents or girlfriend and spoke with them for a minute, the attack would subside. I started to exhibit what would become entrenched patterns of avoidance of the trigger scenarios - I avoided being alone, I avoided public transit, I took shifts that coincided with those of my coworkers. My girlfriend and parents started getting two or three calls a day from me, for no particular reason - I hadn't yet told anyone about the attacks.

Eventually, I acknowledged that something was wrong, but I still had no idea what. I went to my doctor, who ordered a battery of tests - blood tests, ECG, and so on. All of them came back completely normal. The attacks still persisted. Then I ran into a description of the symptoms of a panic attack online, and felt that sense of dawning realization. Every one of my symptoms appeared on the list, and the triggers for the attacks were mentioned as common triggers for panic attacks.

At this point, I felt somewhat better - I knew, at least, that I wasn't experiencing the symptoms of some horrible heart defect. But foolishly, I did not seek any treatment. I thought I could deal with it on my own.

Over the next two years, the attacks worsened. I broke up with my girlfriend and moved back in with my parents. I started to fear the times when I knew I wouldn't be able to get in contact with someone on the phone, because if I had a panic attack I wouldn't be able to stop it. This worrying made me anxious, and this anxiety made panic attacks more frequent and severe. Previously talkative in class, I became more withdrawn. I still spoke up, but it required a conscious effort, and frequently after speaking up I would need to get a glass of water to calm myself down. I was having between two and three panic attacks of moderate strength per day. Still, I didn't pursue any treatment.

Then, at the start of the second semester of my last year of undergrad, shit hit the fan. It was a Thursday. I left the house at 12:04 to walk to the bus stop. My mom was on the phone with a friend in Ontario. At 12:12 I got to the bus stop, already feeling somewhat anxious - I knew that I wouldn't be able to contact my mom if I had a panic attack. At 12:15 the bus arrived, and I got on. Immediately, I felt even more uneasy. But I persevered, and took my seat. The bus I was on passes through an area which has no cell phone signal just before it reaches the university. At 12:19, the bus stopped in this area to let off a nun. I looked at her as she got off, and checked my phone. 12:19, no cell signal. Immediately a severe panic attack hit. I felt like I was being hit by a train. I was dizzy, sweating, my heart was pounding. I needed to *run*, but I couldn't. The attack lasted for half an hour, and only subsided when I took a cab home.

Finally, I sought treatment. However, the attack had been severe enough that I now was psychologically incapable of being alone for any period of time, or of taking the bus on my own. If I was, I would have a panic attack. Fear took over my life. Despite weekly therapy sessions, I was more or less unable to attend class. This caused academic complications for me that I'm still sorting out. 

Flash forward eight months. I'm living in my own apartment in a different city from my family and fiancee, I'm in graduate school, and I teach three tutorials a week. When I go home to visit, I take public transit and the ferry alone. None of this bothers me anymore. The panic attacks are under control (touch wood!) - in fact, they simply do not occur anymore (again, touch wood!). How, you might wonder, did this happen?

- **Cognitive behavioural therapy**

- **The right medication**

- **Support from those close to me**

I cannot stress enough the importance of these. CBT is one of the more difficult things that I've done, but it was immensely helpful. I still use the techniques I learned when I'm feeling anxious or nervous about, for example, giving a lecture. The medication is also immensely helpful. I don't take much (75mg of Effexor daily), but it provides me enough of a leg up that the CBT techniques can really be effective. Without CBT or medication, I would not be where I am today.

The support from others is also of great importance. What I have found is that the hardest step for me was being open and honest about the problems that I was facing - once I told the people I trusted about my anxiety, they were happy to help me, and their support made an immense difference. I spent a long time trying to hide my anxiety and pretend that I was okay, but bottling it up did me no good whatsoever. Letting a trusted few know about it and telling them how they could help me was one of the key steps on the road to winning my life back. 

I don't think that I've ""conquered"" anxiety by any stretch of the imagination. There will be times in my life when it crops up again, in times of stress or illness. But I have my life back now. And if you are experiencing anxiety and feeling lost at sea, remember: *it will be okay. Both now and in the long term, you will be alright. In the short term, the fear that you have will subside. In the long term, you will learn how to work with and disarm that fear, and you will be free to live your life the way you want to again.*",,False,,t5_2qmij,False,,,True,t3_106il4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/106il4/thought_id_share_my_story_and_remind_others_that/,

1345411974.0,27,self.Anxiety,yhmvy,Constant negative rumination after social interactions with strangers.,,27,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/yhmvy/constant_negative_rumination_after_social/,"Hi Anxiety Reddit, 

I have had this problem for a really long time. It tends to involve social situations that do not go 100% in my favor. I tend to play out 'what if's' and 'I should've' - what if I said that, what if I did that, I should've said that, I need to stand up for myself more, I need to interject more, I need to be more assertive. It's a constant wheel of repetition. It often last for days. At worst, it's weeks after a single negative social interaction.

This has been an issue since I was a child, and has gotten worse as I've gotten older. I believe my earliest memories of me doing this has been around 1st grade. I believe my issue is related to genetics and bad parenting that contributed to an anxious life style.

**Example 1:** The other day me and my SO went to the local museum and the cashier asked ""Are you a student? Students with their student ID get a discount!"" 

I was a student once at the college listed on my ID. I'm not a student there anymore, graduated with a master's in experimental psychology, working in a neuroscience lab now and taking a few phd level classes elsewhere to see if a phd is up my alley. In any case, I said I was a student and showed the ID of my old school that I still carried in my wallet. 

He says, ""Great! What are you two studying?""

I say, ""Psychology."" I didn't want to ho into detail that I have/pursuing/pursued an advanced degree in psychology. Many people tend to look at me funny or not want to talk to me afterwards. Especially since I live in an area where there isn't a lot of college educated individuals. Sometimes I even get backlash for it. For example, one blue collar guy went on a rant involving, 'So you think you're better than me, huh!?' No, I don't sir, I say. Sometimes, I feel bad mentioning I have an advanced degree where I live. I only feel proud when I can talk about scientific topics to like minded others, where I don't have to be ashamed. My SO says I act ashamed of my intelligence, drive and accomplishments.

My SO says, ""Finance.""

The cashier, ""I hate psychology. That's the worst subject! Finance, I understand that. I don't like psychology. I'd get into analyzing my head and others. I think it's ridiculous. Finance good, Psychology bad...... at least for me."" His speech was in front of a line of people behind me that extended a good 20 feet.

Needless to say, I let his little tirade bug me for the better part of 48 hours. I constantly ruminate on it with things like I should've interjected and been assertive about my field, or mentioned that I'm not a 'lowly undergrad,' as my other grad school friends humorously put it. Other times I just let the event play out in my head like a broken record. I kept hearing, 'psychology is the worst subject!' over and over again. Dedicating six plus years to a craft, science, and knowledge and have someone say that made me a bit upset.

With my educational background and knowing what's going in my head, I should have the power to stop ruminating. I guess it's easier said than done with me. I'm no clinician, perhaps I need professional help. My SO and I conclude that I do fine in stressful big situations (e.g. getting the car stuck in the mud, getting lost in a new york city on vacation), but little social interactions with strangers appear to be my kryptonite.

**Example 2:** I went on a camping trip this year, and I used the utility sink to brush my teeth. As I finish up, I see a guy with a few pots and pans in my periphery. As I leave, I nod to acknowledge his presence. He then says rather aggressively ""UTILITY SINK IS FOR WASHING DISHES!"" I walk away to use the bathroom thinking, wow that guy was a real jerk. Maybe I offended him. I don't know. Maybe I should apologize.

I walk back and pass the utility sink and apologize, ""I didn't know it was only for washing dishes. I'm sorry."" 

The man gruffly says, ""It's alright.""

I probably shouldn't have apologized and went along my business. I don't know. Assertiveness appears to be a weak link in me. I also wish I knew how to interject more. For the next day or so, I played out the situation in my head over and over again with things I could've said, ""A sink's a sink. Why so serious about dish washing…"" Or some various snarky comment. I feel as if I have a great and witty sense of humor. My SO sees it, students I teach see it, my coworkers see it, my friends see it, but others see a weak person to pick on I feel. If only I had the courage to say such things to break the ice or tension. Instead, I opted to buy a few assertiveness training books on my kindle and read them for hours on end until I fell asleep in my tent.

I'm still not that assertive after reading those books.

**Example 3:** My boss was training me to use a new piece of equipment in the lab. Halfway through the training session, I absent mindedly placed a hand to lean on a very expensive piece of equipment that was in the lab. Roughly $5k.

He says very quickly, ""Don't lean on that!""

I looked down embarrassed, and quickly jerked my hand back. ""Oh yeah…"" As i said looking at the floor with a shy smile. Yeah…. the expensive piece of equipment, forgot about that.

He just laughed and continued with his speech and training.

I kept playing out the thoughts, geez I just blew a promotion that's terrible! I dwelled on that for a day or so. Once again, I should said something funny, ""Oh just testing the sturdiness!"" I missed that opportunity. 

-----------

These are all recent examples. I gave tons of speeches and presentations at school or at conferences, and I never really dwelled on things as much after the fact. I guess because I had almost complete control during speeches. Interactions are a ever flowing dialog, analogous to an ever changing organism. I have little control over them.

I also have this inner urge to express my masculinity, but not to offend. I feel so conflicted. I want to punch somebody, but I know I can't. I want to berate somebody with swear words or just belittle them, but I know that's not right. To the dude in example one, I wish I could brag about all my accomplishments, educate him in some way, and perhaps even yell… but I feel conflicted to do so. So I try to let it go, but instead I just quietly take it and ruminate and hate my life for the next couple of days until the memory slowly dissipates. 

I feel as if I was **(1) more assertive (2) less ruminative (3) learn the ability to interject instead of waiting for them to finish saying something relevant to me...** I would then lead a more fulfilling life I believe. It's all easier said than done. Even my boss/mentor in graduate school mentioned I need to stop being so passive and agreeable. It is a problem, that I wish I could stop. 

Is there any advice you can give? Should I seek professional help? Are there books you recommend? Do you recommend supplements for this type of anxiety and rumination? I'm not ready for prescription drugs. What type of anxiety would this fit under, anxiety experts? GAD? Social Anxiety?

I feel like most of my friends don't understand what anxiety does to me or even believe it's real. It's so hard to talk about but lately it's been messing up everything.

I guess a quick history is warranted. I just got diagnosed with anxiety a few months ago, but I think I've always had it: awake worrying all night in elementary school, OCD tendencies in middle school. Gradually I have been getting more and more anxiety attacks, mostly triggered by social reasons. I'm so terrified of even offending a friend, if I feel like a best friend is ""mad"" at me I'll hyperventilate and shake and just cry uncontrollably. Lately it's even gone beyond social anxiety and I'll just start sobbing and freaking out for *no reason at all*. I found a spider in my room and I was in a ball shaking and imagining that a million of them were crawling all over my bed.

I went to a psychiatrist, and he decided that I have ADD and that was more of an issue to be addressed. He prescribed me welbutron (or something like that), and after weeks of taking it the only difference I felt was being constantly irritable at everyone all the time.

I went back to him and told him I could live with the ADD but my anxiety attacks were getting worse. He wanted to prescribe me SSRI's. For some reason the thought of taking them (and the side effects) terrified me. I had an attack right there in his office trying to decide what to do. After 20 minutes of going back and forth he got frustrated, prescribed me adderall for ADD, and told me I would just have to live with the anxiety then because he wouldn't consider any other medication. (I occasionally self-medicate with benzos, and that's what I was expecting him to have me try.)

For the past week or two I have been constantly on the verge of tears. I'll wake up crying sometimes. I was sent home from work (waiting tables) twice in a row because I was shaking and crying before I even clocked in. My boss even assumed I had quit one day and I almost lost my job. Last night at work all I could focus on was imagining the guy I like having sex with this gorgeous girl he was hanging out with that night. It's like I forced myself to focus on every detail until I was crying out back, thinking about how much of a loser I am, how nobody really likes me.

My body hurts. All the time. Headaches, backaches, feeling allover sore when I haven't really done that much. Maybe it's just because I work graveyard shifts on the weekends, but even when I've caught up on sleep/fixed my schedule I'm always tired.

So all I do now is work and sleep. I come home from work, crawl into bed, and pretty much do nothing else until it's time to get back to work again. This morning (7am) I went to the river with a few coworkers to smoke, and while I felt calm and collected, I didn't feel happy. I looked at the water and that sense of euphoria I usually get from being in nature was missing.

I do have moments where I'm having fun. There's periods of time when I can joke and laugh and feel normal. But the second I get a chance to think too much, I'll find something to overthink about, and go back to self-pitying.

I used to feel genuine happiness but lately all I can do is worry. I worry about what my friends think of me, and that I never see them anymore. If it's not because of work, it's because I don't want to get out of bed. I worry about school even though I'm on break. I worry about being pregnant because my period's three days late (maybe I am, who knows).

I could always deal with my anxiety until now. I feel like shit all the time. Tonight I'm forcing myself to go out to a friend's party and socialize and maybe it will make me feel better. But I know that one little upsetting thought will cross my mind and I'll be crying outside and chainsmoking.

I don't know if I need advice or just a hug or just someone to tell me to stop feeling sorry for myself. I know that I'm doing a lot of things wrong. I shouldn't smoke cigarettes, or take my Adderall, or buy the occasional klonopin off a friend. I shouldn't even drink. But I do all of these things because they help me in that one moment. Or maybe it's because I want myself to feel worse. I don't know.

If anyone actually read this, thank you. I'm indecisive about a lot of things but I know that I want to feel happy again. I want to hang out with friends without *pretending* to be happy, to plaster on this smile that drops the second I turn away.

I want to stop overthinking and overreacting and crying and shaking and forcing myself to leave the house. I want to relax and think rationally and laugh and kiss someone and spend hours getting ready because I can't wait to go out and be the life of the party.

Anxiety is worse than any physical pain I could ever recall. It hurts you deeply and so misunderstood! We're called crazy... because no one understands. Mind is constantly racing and your life IS your phobia. Screw deep breathing! I just wanted to be fixed! 

It started when i was 16, I took a medication that I happened to later find out I was allergic to. It was a Sunday so I had to go to a health clinic because all the doctors offices were closed. My heart was racing (144 resting heart rate) and I was on the verge of passing out. 

PASSING OUT... FAINTING... that was NOW my phobia. I live in the south east united states so it gets really hot here. Heat scared me... low blood sugar scared me... bridges scared me because I couldn't pull over if I were to faint. (Or so I thought) I checked out from school every single day... until finally they sent me to the school shrink and I realized I had an anxiety problem. I did crazy things like not getting in a car unless it was already turned on with air conditioning for a few minutes and I had to have an ice pack with me. Always carried bananas and crackers in my backpack at school just incase I happen to get low blood sugar.
After about 3 months they started medicating me. Lexipro...Buspar (both anxiety medications) stomach medication (due to the anxiety I was producing too much stomach acid) I was in HELL... I wanted to die. This was no way to live... I surely couldn't live like this forever. I couldn't drive... leave my house... hang out with friends. I was too scared... worst part is no one understood. 

Fast forward to 3 therepists and 4 medications later I met someone who saved my life. She was a Cognitive Behavioral therepist... after 2 years of my life wasted to my phobia she fixed me. She forced me to face my fears. That's all I had to do.. face my fears! Cognitive behavioral therepy saved my life... I am now 23 years old and on no medications for anxiety. Passing out is not even a thought that crosses my mind.  Here's a few tips she gave me: 

* carry your ice pack around to hot places... you'll use it until you realize you won't need it anymore. (Use your crutch to help you get out. Slowly pull yourself apart from it at your own pace.) 

*DEEP BREATHING..deep breathing always made me feel worse... like I couldn't breathe. So I started to count.. 1..2...3..4..5... in....5..4...3..2..1 out. I was in control. 

*crossing the bridge was the hardest thing for me. I had to do it because I live in a small town where you HAVE to cross a 3 mile bridge to get to anything worth while. I would call my mom everyday to and from work or school. Making her talk the whole way. Then... I only needed her half way... then a quarter... then not at all. (Again using a crutch to help you... I used it until I didn't need to anymore.) 

*always carrying a small snack... turned into just carrying a dollar or 2 to go the vending machine just incase I was feeling a little low and hungry. 


Anyway I know this isnt much but I wanted to give some people a little hope. Seeing other people go through something that controls their life...its anything but fair. Its a long road but it will get better... this isn't the end. :) ",,False,,t5_2qmij,1338227298.0,,,True,t3_u8xpk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/u8xpk/i_was_a_victim_of_anxiety_disorder_for_2_years_i/,
