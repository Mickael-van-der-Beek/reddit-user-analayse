1358499039.0,928,self.Blacksmith,16t49n,Damascus Steel theories?,ThoseBlues,1145,217,441,http://www.reddit.com/r/Blacksmith/comments/16t49n/damascus_steel_theories/,"I guess we all know the secret to the original technique of creating Damascus steel is lost, but could one of you forgers test a theory for me? I knew of a scientist with multiple doctoral degrees who taught himself the Aramaic language and resided in many parts of the Middle East in order to read the old texts and try and find the secret of the steel. The secret step? Quenching the sword in the urine of a pregnant mare (i.e. horse). Not too different from the [""letter to the museum a Pakistani told of a sword held in his family for many generations, quenched by its Afghan makers in donkey urine""](http://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/29/science/the-mystery-of-damascus-steel-appears-solved.html). 

Now I know most of you are thinking this is complete bullshit, but I am desperate for someone to test this hyphthesis because maybe there is a chance. 
Take a look at the article I linked for more examples of the legends of quenching the blades in different liquids.

Well, here they are.
first, the grandaddy of them all, the Blacksmith's craft;
http://www.metalwebnews.org/ftp/blacksmithscraft.pdf
Use it as you would a course manual. Start from the beginning, and do every exercise until you can produce the final product easily. I tell people to do the first item, keep the first one you make, then do 5 to 10 more and look at the last one. Compare them. It will make you feel good trust me.

Secondly, Wrought Ironwork.
This one is my personal favorite. It's where you get into the decorative stuff. Beautiful instructions.
http://www.metalwebnews.org/ftp/wroughtironwork.pdf

And lastly, Decorative Ironwork.
http://www.metalwebnews.org/ftp/decorativeironwork.pdf
This book, when used as a course manual, is the ""final test"" for English Blacksmiths. They choose one grill to make, and get to work. The finished product is judged by the instructors.

These three books are so well written that I cannot reccomend them highly enough to anyon starting out.

And as an aside, the hands you see in the books belonged to a man named Tommy Tucker, who was my teachers, teacher.
A giant in the world of English Blacksmithing. Two of my books were autographed by him (which is why I have these PDF's printed out so I don't muck up my books).

So there you have it people. My reccomendation for the best books available to the beginning, intermediate and even master blacksmiths out there.

This last weekend, I spent in a replica Viking encampment for 4 days.
Living in Viking era tents, eating the same foods they did, and working the way they did.
Naturally, as a Blacksmith, I wanted to show visitors how our brother smiths worked metal in the early to mid Iron age.
Turns out, it's not so easy.
I used a portable forge that was not so much a forge, but was more of a set of double bellows (recreated from a found example in Sweden) using a pierced stone as the heat-shield to keep the Bellows from being scorched. Then it was a matter of getting some river stones together to make the forge proper. 
Now, it's on a box because the town of Gimli where the celebration was held, doesn't allow us to have fires directly on the ground. So the wooden boxes are filled with sand and we make our fires on those. Including my forge. 
I tried to make it as authentic as possible. It is impressive what you can make with just a few hammers, a cutter and a lump anvil though.

First, a view from the side where most of the public would walk up to the forge;

A view from behind the bellows. My son spent a lot of time here;

Now this stuff, used by European Blacksmiths since the 1920's is nothing short of a marvel.
It came in sheets that were scored so you could break off small pieces. You heated the steel, scarfed the ends and got it to a red heat, then stuck a small piece on on end of the steel you wanted to weld, and then stuck the other piece to it. It was then stuck there like a tack weld. At a red heat.
Then, at a yellow/ orange, you took it out, and finished the weld.
That's it. 
The process is even mentioned in the Blacksmith's craft by COSIRA. Most English blacksmiths swore by the stuff.

What I would like to do, is have a piece of it analyzed, find out what's in it, and see if it can be reproduced today.

I'm 17 and stuck in a suburban house and as you can imagine, funds and space are limited. It took a lot of effort to reclaim the garage which was previously filled with junk, you couldn't get a yard in without having to walk over stuff, the floor wasn't visible and it looked like something from Hoarders. I cleared it out as best I could, I still have to have a lot of stuff I don't personally use stored in there, but it's generally under control.

To get this to work, most things have to be portable, so it can be stowed away and quickly deployed when I'm doing forge work. This is what I'm dealing with, the garage on my front drive:

http://i.imgur.com/aerST.jpg

So my brake drum forge is on wheels, it sits just outside the door so all the smoke goes into the air. I've got my eye out for a crank blower to attach to the side to make it even easier. As it is, I have to bring out a box I made up with a bus demister fan in it, attatch the hose then lug a 24V battery charger to power it, then run an extension cable. It blows 700CFM on full blast though, it doesn't lack for guts! I'll try to get a picture of it set up next time I'm in the shop.

http://i.imgur.com/nglpx.jpg

This is my welding bench. It's way to tall. It's a aluminium frame with a wooden top. Really solid. That there on the bench is the work in progress of my belt grinder. Don't worry, those welds are all being redone, gasless MIG really isn't good enough for this stuff. Just got to do that and fit the pillow blocks and drive train.

http://i.imgur.com/P3G9R.jpg

Under the bench here I've made room for a tool table. Again, I'm gonna wheel it out near the anvil when I'm forging and tuck it here when I'm not. It'll give my hammers a better place to go, a place for my small punches and chisels and prevent me dumping stuff on my workbench when I'm forging.

http://i.imgur.com/6boyb.jpg

This is the main workbench. Built out of timber. Really solid, drawers are from an old unit. I may cover the whole thing with steel sheet so I can put hot stuff on there, and so it can be cleaned easily, this stains badly. Working on the placement of the vises. The container at the end is full of veggie oil for quenching, it's really not ideal, but it works well enough for what I do. On the bench is a bracket I made, my first ornamental project, with an anvil sign I cut that I'm going to hang outside.

http://i.imgur.com/rOvSR.jpg

This is just a quick tool rack I made out of scrap wood and a bit of steel sheet. It'll serve until I've built the tool table.

http://i.imgur.com/PBkLW.jpg

A final picture. The anvil is dragged further from the wall and it's nice and close to where the forge is when it's out.

http://i.imgur.com/RSrJk.jpg

I wish I could show you what it looked like before I requisitioned it. There was just nothing, no tools, no bench, just tons of junk that we threw in there. There's still a lot to do, and I'd be glad for your advice as to how to improve. As a student, I don't get a lot of time, nor money, so I usually have to make do with what I can scrounge, make or find cheap. Lots of rooting through scrapyards! I've only moved to the garage about 3 months ago, which is when I started clearing it out and making it my own. Most of it was built at the weekends. Saturdays I forge, Sundays I either do cold work or fix up the shop. But I got a lot of it done during the school holidays. I think it's reasonably good demo of what you can do with limited space in a suburban area!

I think I'll say goodbye to the leaf bladed arrowheads for a while, they don't seem to be turning out very well and they're not getting better.
So, I'll concentrate on the bodkin points and the long pointed ones. Besides those use less steel and I can sell them for the same price!

  This is my first attempt at building a knife.  I forged it out of an old mechanics pry bar.  Some experimenting with the hardening and tempering resulted in a water quench. Tempered at 350 degrees for 45 mins. Handle is made out of Cherry and finished to 1500 grit, rubbed with Boiled Linseed Oil for protection. Brass pins and 2 part epoxy hold the scales in place.
  It seems to hold an edge sharp enough to shave hair. Not sure about the overall durability, time will tell. I learned a lot in the process and hope to make each one better than the last. This one will be given away to a friend. Thanks for looking!

Four dwarves, all huddled around one bright orange sword, taking synchronized whacks at the metal, like the ticking of a fine timepiece.  
Were smiths of antiquity able to accomplish this?  Obviously mankind has amassed some fairly monstrous war machines and industrial feats, but to my dulled mind, this seems impossible.  I suppose I could imagine two master smiths being so skilled as to work in perfect harmony, but even then it seems like a stretch.
Are there any examples of tandem smithing out there?  Or do you think it is theoretically possible given the right circumstances?
Thanks for indulging my idle musings.

The monster on the right is a replica of a 15th Century arrowhead. It's actually a bit small when compared to the original.

After researching all the kits you can buy online and just how expensive all the pulleys and wheels are I decided to go as cheap as I could on the frame and build with whatever scrap I had lying around. I ended up with a very solid piece of machinery and I'm incredibly pleased with it, even if it does look like frankenstein's monster. I'm posting these (mostly) step by step instructions to help out anyone else who is interested in building one, and I'd be happy to answer any questions. I had originally wanted to do a youtube video, but I quickly discovered that my camera I haven't used in almost 2 years does not have a very long battery life anymore, so I scrubbed that plan. Next on the plate of step by step constructions is a new propane forge to hopefully answer a lot of the common questions we get around here, enjoy!

Catch was, I only had 2 hours in which to make them, and then drive out to give it to him before the shop closed.

Apparently there will be a scene of some Inuit hunters that get permission to harvest a Minke whale, and they need harpoons and flensing knives (they're mounted on short poles and used to butcher the whale) for that scene.
They'll be making an entire mock-up of a whale that can be cut up for the scene. No actual whales will be harmed.
Should be pretty cool if I get the job. There is talk of flying me up to the site to talk to the hunters directly about what they want (traditional tools mixed with imported ones).

So, this is what I came up with. The center, or 'spit' part of it, has a forge welded eye that I think will be much stronger and better in the long run.
The other two pieces have the first inch of the fold forge welded to give them strength, they'll be pounded into the ground a lot so I wanted to make sure they were strong enough to take it.

I've been interested in blacksmithing for quite a while now and I plan to get into it when I grow up and can afford my own forge and tools.

As a matter of fact, I was interested in knowing exactly how many tools one needs to be able to, let's say, craft a sword. And also how much it would cost to get these tools.

So I decided to create a list of tools one should acquire to craft such a thing. Based on Niels Provos's excellent video series [The Serpent in the Sword](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUkYJeZtW4) I kind of wrote down everything he had, I also added other stuff I saw in different videos.

*Here it is:*

* **""Big tools""**

Metal Saw

Forge (propane forge)

Coal Forge

Power hammer

Anvil

Belt Sander

Hight temperature oven for heat treating

Ben Saw

Drill press


* **Accessories**

Set of hammers

Steel splitters (w/ hammers)

Files (lots from what i saw)

Apron

Gloves

Glasses / Mask

grinder

Plasma Welder

Torch

Vise


* **Materials**

Different type of steel

Borax

Steel Sand

Coal

Clay (for crucible)

Acid and other chemical liquids (for etching)

Quenching liquid

Clay or other stuff for coating before quenching


+ a large room (in your garden) when you can store everything and you can have high current to power all this machinery


I put everything in an [open spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvsxZ2Vgy-YqdF9ublNOMW4yZnF5clVGV0VtY1BaQnc) so that anyone can edit.

What do you think of this list? What do you think is the most important when starting?
What was your budget when you started?


I also plan on adding references and/or website where to purchase that stuff from (both in the US and in Europe), you're welcome if you want to help!

Ugly and rough, though If I had bothered to finish it by grinding and such, I'm sure it would look a lot nicer.

But it wasn't a very nice one, so after lunch I tried a second one. This one turned out a bit nicer.

Now, on this one I did do a few things differently; I made the slit in the socket much longer and rounded up that part a bit. And the head itself, I forged the tails, but didn't bother with the tip. I waited to form that part after the two pieces were welded together.
Much easier and faster I must say.
I've got a few ideas about making these a bit easier and I'll bounce them off a few colleagues before I try again.

The rust treatment was a bit of an ordeal, but turned out really well.  In the future if I'm doing this kind of thing in-house, I'll have to get some proper vats and bulk chemicals.  The Honey Goo is also way too expensive for such a large piece (I didn't realize how much it would take until I'd used up the can I already had - no turning back!).  In any case, this is essentially a temporary finish.  I'll have to check on it in the spring and touch up any patches of orange rust.

Edit just to mention that in the last pic, in the upper left-hand corner, you can see a leaf that was done before I made the creasing tool.

**Proposal**

&gt;The idea that is being proposed is that the members of  /r/Blacksmith that are interested in making money from blacksmithing come together to form a collective store online.
&gt;
&gt;* The store would be managed by me or other members of the business.
&gt;
&gt;* Most if not all successful sale money will be returned to the producer of the item.
&gt;
&gt;* Shipping will be the responsibility of the person who has the item. I am willing to store, process, and ship any items that I have or receive on behalf of other members.
&gt;
&gt;* Possibly a small % of the sales will be kept to provide advertisement, materials, and training for members.
&gt;
&gt;The goal of this business is to provide a nurturing environment for /r/Blacksmith’s active smiths to sell and profit from their craft.
&gt;
&gt;This will all be based loosely on the Cooperative Business model. Principles can be found here.
&gt;
&gt;[Co-Op Principles by the National Cooperative Business Association
&gt;](http://www.ncba.coop/ncba/about-co-ops/co-op-principles)
&gt;
&gt;The actual platform that I believe we should use will be www.etsy.com or a similar website. The reasons for this is: 
&gt;
&gt;* They offer a platform for us to sell our goods that is user friendly and convenient
&gt;
&gt;* They specialize in hand crafted goods.
&gt;
&gt;* They have a large base of consumers that visit the website.
&gt;
&gt;If there are any questions about the proposal feel free to ask.

**Current Timeline and Discussions**

*^If ^you're ^reading ^this ^at ^least ^post ^a ^reply ^to ^the ^first ^question.*

* Open discussion on /r/Blacksmith

 * Should this be kept to a separate sub reddit?

* ~~Construct membership applications~~

 * ~~Post format for people to use~~

* Elect decision making group or full democratic?

 * Should there be an electoral system where members are placed in position to put ideas up for vote or should everyone have this option at first?

* Determine direction of co-op

 * Etsy? Other options?

*This will be updated as I go along. Right now this is the bare bones idea and is subject to change based on feedback.*

I'll be back in there tomorrow to finish up.
I thought I'd post two of the things I made today (I know you guys are sick of my arrow and spearheads so I'll spare you)
First, the beginnings of a sword hanger for a friend. It will mount on a plate and screw to the wall in his man-cave when it's done.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/rH6ZU.jpg)

And a short coat hook for a friend who is a wood carver. This is to hang his coat and apron in his shop. We traded work for work. I'm hoping to get more to him, he does nicely turned bowls and cups.

Edit,
Well my class was cancelled tonight (I'm on my Level 1 Firefighter's course) so back into the shop I went. 
I managed to finish the sword hanger;

I think it should work nicely, and not detract too much from the guy's sword. He didn't really give me much in the way of direction other than; ""It should attach to the wall and hang up my sword"".
Hopefully, he'll like it.

[This is what it feels like when I accidently miss and hit the anvil.](http://i.imgur.com/3SBQy.gif)

[This is the first thing I ever made.](http://imgur.com/ZMyW0)  It's a mixture of techniques applied to make a leaf blank (that I made too skinny), a couple of bends, and I got the end tapered and curled to the curve of the larger bar stock, but wanted to take a break from hammering (getting limp wrist) so I didn't forge weld the two together.  This was made during free shop time with just hammer and anvil, it doesn't do anything, but I was still impressed with my efforts anyway and had a blast making it.

[Today was my first official class day and I was instructed to make these](http://imgur.com/8YIKZ) after given instructions on how to hammer properly to prevent wrist injuries.  It was an exercise on making sharp and square tapers while getting the metal as smooth as possible without using a steel brush.  I was happy because my corners are very sharp, it is 1/2"" square stock reduced to 1/8th"" square at the end, both tapers are 4"" long and the total length is 6"".  Not the straightest things in the world but my teacher (he prefers this instead of ""sir"" or ""professor"") said it was good enough for my second time at the anvil.

We also were given the basics on starting a coal fire and tool preparation (shaving down hammer handles to make them more ergonomic (because bought hammer handles are WAY too big for using for hours on end), setting handles on files, the proper way to sharpen chisels to the point that you can shave with them (in case we make tools for the stone carvers or timber framers), and thats all I can think of for right now.

Here is the backstory:  I moved to Charleston, SC to pursue a career in blacksmithing and/or architectural ironwork at The American College of the Building Arts.  The school is approximatley 10 years old and is on its way to becoming an acredited educational facility.  I highly suggest that if you are thinking about this career path or others, check out the school (they offer Stone Carving, Carpentry, Forged Architectural Ironwork, Plaster, Preservation Masonry, and Timber Framing).  It was hell for me moving to Charleston for the first two months (and I still have problems now but I'm fixing them) but things are starting to look up and working on getting better.  It is a four year program and you will graduate with a Bachelors degree in architectural preservation, specializing in ___________.

No.  I will not give you my name.  If you try stalking me I will kill you :).  [If you are serious you can give the school a call and ask when the next open house is.](http://www.buildingartscollege.us/)  Tell them Reddit sent you and I'll hear it down the grapevine and snicker.  Also, don't tell yourself you are too old to go back to college (especially this one), a lot of the student body are 25-40 years old.  Happy and safe forging everyone!

It was inspired by the Inuit Ulu knife.
It turned out rather well. But it is a failure.
In case you can't see it in the photo, there is a hairline fracture right in the middle of the blade. It extends up about halfway into the blade and stops. Now, I've put a great deal of weight on it and it doesn't budge (frontways and side to side) so I think it will be fine.
This will remind me to normalize everything before tempering. Of course, if there was a micro-fracture in it, even normalizing wouldn't help.
Ah well, it's a cute knife anyway and I'll certainly make another.

http://imgur.com/zvTO7)

this is my latest knife, made it in my garage.  

the particulars: 
dimensions:  overall length:  12.5 inches. 
blade length:  8 inches. 
blade made from car spring (a 1980 ford pickup)
handle from oak
crosspiece is from a piece of mild steel i got at lowe's. 
no buttcap because i haven't figured out how to do that well yet. 

process:  cooked the steel in my forge, beat it into rough shape on my railroad anvil, then annealed it.  

next i clamped it in a bench vise and spent HOURS on it shaping it with a file, then graduated to coarse sandpaper, then increasingly finer sandpaper.  final sandpaper for the finish was 600 grit wet to dry. 

then i cooked it in the forge again, quenched it in used motor oil.  cleaned it up, then cooked it in my kitchen oven (got ALL the oil offa it first, that step cannot be overemphasized.)  (your wife will be so pissed if you fuck this part up) at 400 degrees for 10 minutes,  then cooled it. 

next i cleaned it up again with the sandpaper, shaped my wood blocks, drilled holes, cut 4 brass dowels, and epoxy'd the whole thing together (smooth on EA 40 i think is what i used).  cooked it under a shop light for 4 hours, then used a bench grinder to rough shape, covered the blade with leather then clamped it in the bench vise, and used a variety of rasps and files to shape the grip.  finally sanded the shit out of it (increasing fineness of sandpaper, again),  then, lastly, stained it several times then clear coated it with Dreft.

Anyway I'd thought I'd share.

So this is finished project:
[font](http://imgur.com/a/aBgVd#0)  &amp; [side](http://imgur.com/a/aBgVd#1)

It's about 17"" across and 8""-9"" deep.  Gets nice and hot and I'm very pleased.  The [hole in the bottom of the drum](http://imgur.com/a/aBgVd#4) was a bit of a problem, as it was nearly 9"" in diameter.  Fortunately I had a [spent helium cylinder](http://imgur.com/a/aBgVd#7) that just happened to be 9"" across.  That's the pan you see sitting in the bottom of the drum: I cut the tank in half and cut slits vertically down to where it began to curve every 2"" or so around the perimeter, and then bent the resulting flaps down.  The result is [this metal flower looking thing](http://imgur.com/a/aBgVd#5). I then attached some 1-1/2"" pipes and fittings, hammered the ""metal flower"" into the brake drum hole and there you have it.  I tested it about a week ago (still waiting to pick up a piece of RR Track to use as an anvil, should get that Monday).  With just a 2-speed hair dryer and some lump charcoal I easily got up to forging temps in a few minutes.

Edit: I made the ""metal flower thing"" because I can't weld and don't know anyone that can.  All the cuts (including the drum) were made using a circular saw and cut off wheel (I burned through one entirely and half of the second cutting the drum itself).",,False,self,t5_2r2f0,1374431744.0,,,True,t3_1irflt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Blacksmith/comments/1irflt/another_brake_drum_forge/,

It had to look ""like it was an antique"" and he would print out a Maltese cross and a motto along with an engraved brass plaque for it.

Before I do this, however, I am required to interview a blacksmith who has more than 10 years experience in the field. Any help I can get from anyone here will be greatly appreciated because, as you know, smiths are hard to find these days, reddit is practically my only hope.

As for the interview, it will be short, most likely less than 20 questions, it can be anonymous if you would like, I can e-mail you the questions when I receive them from my professor, and it shouldn't take a long time. I would prefer detailed questions, but obviously some of the questions will just be quick one sentence answers.

DUE TO the difficulty of finding someone with more than 10 years experience, I have been granted the ability to interview someone with only 5 or more, but I would prefer to interview the person with the most experience. If you know someone that fits this but isn't on reddit, please tell them about me because I have a feeling it is going to be difficult finding someone that is willing to do this.

Please upvote for visibility, it is a self post so I am not going to receive any karma or what not. Thank you all very much and I look forward to hearing from you!

My 2 main questions are whats a good copper to tin ratio, and what would be the best way to actually go about making the blade.  We have oiled silica sand so would casting the blade be best or just casting an ingot and then shaping on an anvil.

I'm not expecting anything spectacular in terms of quality but I figured this would be a fun little weekend project.

Flipping through the designs book from the Rural Development Committe in the UK, I happened upon a design that we both liked.
Here is the basic sign, tack welded together, waiting for my wife to make a stained glass set of numbers that will go in the larger of the two frames;

Here is a quick chalk drawing of what will go in the smaller frame;

And a chalk drawing of what will go on the supporting shaft (3/4"" square pipe) about 3' from the ground. The shaft will be 6' tall with 18"" of it in the ground surrounded by concrete;
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/o4jE0)

I'll post more photos as the project moves along.

Here is another progress photo;
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/c0Q2O)

I finished the decorative element for the supporting post. The post itself will be 3/4"" square pipe so it will be a lot stronger (and a LOT cheaper) than the 3/4"" square stock I have in place now.
The top twist is solid 3/4"" and it's cut about 5"" long. That will be welded to the pipe once I get it and ground smooth. Once painted the weld won't be noticeable.

Update!
Well, it's almost done! The pieces have all been welded together. Now I have to clean it with solvent and then spray paint it with a decent rust paint.
My wife started working on the numbers tonight. I cut a piece of 1"" plywood that fits snugly into the larger of the two windows. Her plan is to have the 537 on one side, and the numbers in reverse on the other!

Quenched the edge too hard while attempting to straighten the handle socket.

I've asked at Les Schwab quite a bit and they're always happy to let me glance in their recycle bin but they never have drums, of course. 

Down the street there's another brake place, Brake Team. Every time I walk in there I see a few brake drums laying around. The drums are mostly off of cars being serviced, but it's still a good indicator that they probably have some in their recycle bin. Too bad Brake Team NEVER lets me look at their recycle bin. You'd think they kept it filled with diamonds. I offered to swap them two old rotors for a drum, thinking maybe they were worried about recycling income. They still turned me away. Bastards. I've never seen a brake drum anywhere else...

So does anyone have any better advice for obtaining a brake drum?

Instead, should I just line a charcoal grill with clay and run an air tube along the bottom?

Would this be BETTER than the brake drum forge? Seems like it'd be able to get hotter because of the larger volume and better insulation.

Craftsman 2.5 lb cross-peen.

* Used for general forging and double striking.

* The handle is carved down and fit to my hand by me and the hammer head was ground down and faced to my teachers suggestion.

* Present from an ex-coworker when he found out I was going away to study blacksmithing.  Used for general forging and double striking.  I like it because it works, nothing fancy about it but it is good to help get me on my feet.

* I wish the hammer was wider and stouter, the balance is unwieldy when using the peen.

MATCO 3 lb ball-peen.

* Used for moving a lot of metal faster than I could with the craftsman.

* I handled it, carved the handle, and faced it myself.  The face is rounder than the cross-peen to help move the metal faster, I have yet to use the ball peen side for anything other than demolishing wood peices for practice and firewood.

*  From my fathers old MATCO tools franchise.  It was supposed to be a replacement head for one of my fathers customers when he decided he didn't want it anymore.  Found its way into my hands after sitting around doing nothing.

* I don't have any cons for this hammer, it works great for what I use it for.

Higher carbon content=Sharper blade more chipping

I think that it is a great project for beginners because of its simplicity, the availability of spikes, and the fact that it is a knife and many beginners want to be blade-smiths. The thing is, I feel that it is misleading to tout this as a quality knife making project. At best you are making a mediocre knife that will need frequent sharpening.

The truth is, a knife is only as good as the steel it is forged from. In the case of railroad spikes we are talking sub-par knife making steel with a carbon content only worthy of mild tool steel at best. The RR spikes stamped HC (high carbon) are only about 1040 steel while quality knife making steel is usually 1060 to 1090 steel. One may be able to find spikes with a greater carbon content, but to confirm the quality the steel needs to be spark tested (something which beginner smiths may find hard or impossible to do). My aim here is to educate and prevent new smiths from being misled.

Progress on the shop continues slowly.  In the past couple of weeks my [anvil and other orders](http://imgur.com/a/lcCsB) arrived at the border, and my wife and I drove down to pick them up.  Turns out importing commercial goods is a little more involved than bringing back a bottle of tequila, but it was interesting to get a glimpse of how international trade operates.

We fixed up [my little office](http://imgur.com/a/DdUOm), which smelled like something had died in it and looked like other things *would* die if they stayed in it too long.  I just need to add a source of coffee and some kind of couch/table combo for client meetings and it's good to go.

I'm finally getting around to cleaning up the blower, but I've hit a snag: [One of the gears](http://imgur.com/a/c02Fh#1) on this model is made out of a cellulose/bakelite composite (I think, based on age), and it's coming apart.  It's the same shape as one of the metal gears, so my options are to have a copy machined, find a matching stock component somewhere, or restore the original using solvent-thinned epoxy like what's used on rotten wood.

Unfortunately, no one who saw that post was familiar with him or his work.

In the time since then, my friends and I completed his Introduction to Blacksmithing course through Brookhaven Community College in Dallas.  If anyone in the area is interested, I can highly recommend Kelly as an instructor.  Not only is he experienced with the craft and with teaching, he is also well-connected with the local smithing scene in and around the DFW metroplex and through him you can meet many other enthusiasts and professionals in the [North Texas Blacksmiths Association](http://www.ntxba.org/).

Over the course of the introductory semester, we produced punches, chisels, nail headers (and more nails than I care to recall), several tongs, bick-irons, hold downs, turning forks, and learned a lot about the craft itself.  He's very good about telling you *why* you do what you're doing--not just giving you orders without context--and has been helpful (and enthusiastic!) about assisting my friends and me in setting up our own workshop.

We're all heading back in a few weeks for the Intermediate course and some more of our friends are going to be taking the Beginner's course over the summer and then some more in the fall.  So, if you are interested in blacksmithing and wondering how to learn more or get some practical experience, and you live in or around the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, I unreservedly recommend Kelly Kring's classes at [Brookhaven Community College](http://www.brookhavencollege.edu).

So first question, how does one go from break drum to forge?

Obviously it needs some type of stand, and an air blower of some kind, and I figure these things probably have to be welded to it, so does this mean I have to pick up some sort of welding torch?

Does anyone have a good resource on this? 

Also, I picked up a bucket, yes a bucket, of rail road spikes (approx 15-20 spikes) they seem to be in fairly good condition except for some rust, the bucket they were in was full of water, but I don't think they had been sitting in it long because there isn't that much rust on them. So I'm wondering how will rust effect forging with them? Should I do some sort of electrolosis to get rid of the rust first, or will the heat just burn the rust away?

Today I fired my forge at full power for the first time. I knew that the clay coating on the walls of my forge wouldn't hold that well. But I was not expecting what happened next. That clay flaked and ditched me. I was not pleased. I removed the dried up clay in anger. 

I ran to reddit for help. I bought firebrick and fired the forge again. The ducktape that held my hair-dryer on the air blast melted. I was not pleased. 

Nevertheless, the addition of the firebrick brought some unexpected changes to my forge behavior. They form a gentle slope toward the air blast, focusing the air more than before. 

This focused air blast helped me bring a old hammer head to deep yellow when I hardly reached bright red before the addition of the firebrick. I smiled. 

I reached with my tongs and grabbed the yellow-hot hammer head. I steadied it on the anvil and started hammering. I noticed the rounded head flattening where my blows focused. Bright red. Gotta hurry. I hammered faster, as the steel got harder and harder. Deep red. I frowned as the steel became almost imposible to move. Back to the forge.

As I watched the flames, I remembered the railroad spikes knives I saw on reddit. Crude and unpolished I though. Well fuck me colored, I can barely dent an old hammer head! I look at the steel. Bright red. Patience, patience... Is this some kind of fire-watching meditation? /r/Meditation must be laughting is ass off... 

At last! Bright yellow! Here goes! I grab the hammer head and start to pound on it. The steel barely flattens. A glancing blow sends the bright red piece of steel flying. After a short moment of terror, I grab the damn thing, put out the flaming grass and start hammering again. Deep red. No. No, no, no... Don't you dare give up on me! No color... Well fuck me! I trow it back to the forge.

I sight. If my disgust for this hammer head could be used as fuel I'd have infinite coal... Back to fire watching meditation. Must focus fire. Must focus air flow. Must tape hair-dryer to air pipe. This meditation thing looks like it's working... The fireplace is almost empty. That's it for today. I'm spent. I look at the hammer head and leave it to die with the embers. 

I smell like... like smoke. I drag my barbecued ass in the shower. What's wrong with that hammerhead? I know hammers are sturdy but that one is world champ level. Yesterday I quenched that hammer. Quenching hardens steel... Well fuck my flower growing ass! That's whats wrong with my hammer! 

I have soot all up in my ears. Does that makes me a blacksmith, I wonder?

It's a charcoal barbecue. The box is 17""X17"". I drilled a hole, in the middle of the bottom and inserted a 3/4"" copper tube, for airflow. See? A very simple construction. My problem comes with the coating. I've coated the inside with clay. 

It does a great job at blocking heat. I can put my hand on the outside of the forge when in use. My problem is that when it dries, it crack and flakes. I'm spending more time repairing the walls of my forge than forging, which is nonsense. What should I protect the inside of my forge with? Firebrick? Rocks? Concrete? Or nothing at all?

One is because it was poorly designed (which is being rectified at the moment, pictures of the new setup should be posted by Tuesday!), part is because I live in the Pacific Northwest and we don't have a hood to use it under cover when it rains. So I stick to my propane most of the time.

That said, I'll be using it this coming Monday because we have some Boy Scouts coming out to earn their badges by making flint strikers. Now, when I've used it in the past, the one problem I have with it is getting it started in the first place. Everything else goes smooth, but I've never been taught a good way to get it going.

So, does anyone have a good method for getting a good coalbed started? Bonus points for methods that don't rely on modern items like propane torches, since it'll look better for the scouts if we do it 'old school'.

If I am asking stupidly*, can someone please let me know how best to express curiosity primarily involving coal, but secondarily involving blacksmithing?

However I have a slight issue with the banner warning at the top regarding galvanized.  
I have seen the link included in the banner before, and it is a sad story. However if you read that page the gentlemen who died had emphysema, which possibly was aggravated by the zinc fumes, which may have lead to pneumonia several weeks later. The zinc fumes may have been one part that contributed to his death, but if it was, it appears it was only one of many factors.

Melting zinc will not kill you, I have cast zinc in an adequately ventilated area number of times. I have also welded zinc plated steel, again with proper ventilation, and wearing a proper mask, and never suffered any ills because of it. Heating zinc to past its boiling temperature to the point it vaporizes and breathing in the resulting fumes of zinc oxide will likely give you flu like symptoms for up to 48 hours. Then if you are in otherwise good health you will be fine. [OSHA](http://www.osha.gov/doc/outreachtraining/htmlfiles/weldhlth.html) will back me up on this. You will not die from metal fume fever alone, but it could, as the link demonstrates, aggravate other health issues.  

I am all for safety, and adequate ventilation means much more than most people realize. But many metal workers I have come across believe erroneously that heating galvanized will cause irreparable harm or death, which is basically untrue.  It should be treated with caution, and dealt with in a safe manner, but to simply tell people to never do it presents an alarmist and an inaccurate view of the real risks.  I personally would prefer to know those actual hazards, instead of erroneous information, even if it is presented with the best of intentions.
While I do think that the warning is valid,  just the link provided within is overzealous and hyperbolic and should be changed to reflect a more reasonable and informative safety warning.

I presented this argument to the moderators, and got a reply back saying they would consider changing the warning if the community agreed.
So what do you think r/Blacksmith?

The obvious solution would be to bracket, but that means I can often lose a shot at the exact time I want it - i.e, as a piece is being welded, as it's cooling to a particular temperature, etc. Flash won't work - the one I have on the camera is too directional and tends to wash out / reflect of of the surroundings (anvil).

I've been holding off posting it until I fired it for the first time because it was ground up my design, and I wanted to make sure it worked well and didn't require any changes before posting. 

Well, I fired it off yesterday and couldn't be happier. Starting it, which used to take at least 20 minutes of constant attention now takes 5 minutes of relative ease. And that's getting it from bare and cold to working temp. The heat affect zone is huge, but very scalable. I had it down to a 4""x4"" section in the center out to damn near the full 15""x15"" limit of the pan. 

It also seems to make better use of the CFM's being pushed by the blower. It takes very little effort to get it up to welding temps, whereas we used to wear ourselves out cranking the blower to get higher temp ranges. 

All in all, a raging success. If anyone's interested, here are the rough specs:
15""x15"" square
3"" tall walls
7"" deep from top edges of walls to start of truyere
5"" deep from top edges of walls to grate
3"" diameter truyere
8""x8"" grate

Had to resort to stick welding, which I'm terrible at. Also, my apologies for the relatively small number of build photos... I was on a rushed schedule for above reason and seldom remembered to pull out the camera between steps. Lastly, I forgot the bring the actual *camera*...

During the Renaissance, Holy Roman landsknecht would carry big ass swords called zweihander. When these big ass swords would break, the material would be converted into making a smaller sword called a katzbalger. 
I am essentially doing the same thing. By doing this, I am taking the same cross-guard and pommel from the zweihander and using them in the construction of the new sword.

I know how to smelt it. I don't know what actually is needed to go into the steel. Any and all advice is appreciated!** &lt;--

Here is my plan. I want to (very badly) pick up smithing as a hobby. I've done a lot of reading. I know how I'm going to build my forge, I know which tools I'll need to get and I know that its something I'll need to work on to get better.

Now, I want to - at some point down the road - smelt my own steel. I've done a lot of scrounging on the internet for how-to's on the subject but I'm only finding vague stuff. I understand that Crucible Steel Fabrication can be finnicky. But I want to try it. I know how I'm going to build the furnace. I know I'm going to use coal - there is a lot of the high grade stuff just laying on the beaches in the area. I found 10 lbs on a small beach - I'm just specifically looking for the ""recipe"".

Here is what I know. I know that I need some iron (there is plenty of iron ore on the beaches too) and I plan on extracting that from iron ore using the same furnace. I also know that I need to throw in some sand (I'm told that play sand is the best choice as it is cleaner than sand from the beach) and shards of glass to help remove impurities from the molten metal and have them pool on top of the would-be ingot. What I'm sketchy on is the details of what else I need to add to get less of an iron ingot and more of a steel Ingot. I believe its also called Wootz Steel. Some people say add some carbon, some say don't. 

So if anyone has any experience I would **greatly** appreciate any and all information you can provide. Even if it means stringing along many different view points, that would be awesome.

     Here's the actual question:So my question is what process do I go 
through with a piece of ""Damascus"" steel to make the different bands of metal obvious? Do I need to buy some sort of low power acid etchant to soak it in? Can I apply some sort of patina that affects the metal more or less based on carbon content?

I've been reading this sub for a while, getting my feet wet making a few rings from coins, starting to make molds for casting etc, and doing research on different builds for homemade forges. I'm thinking of building either a paint can or tub forge. 

My predicament: I live in-town, neighbors pretty close on both sides, medium sized back yard (with two dogs in it) and I'm renting the house I'm in. I'm thinking, perhaps over cautiously, that running a forge in my garage or backyard may be hazardous or otherwise just not a great idea in a rented home in a medium density area.

Am I being over-cautious and the garage is a perfectly fine place to do some of this work (wanting to get started with some railroad spike level projects)?

The post details thoroughly the attitude and actions a blacksmith should have when hunting for that hard to find tool that he needs. You never know where you're going to find them and these rules will help improve those chances.

Basic rules: 

*ASK* if you are nice you can often get stuff with no hassles


*CHECK* those dumpsters/trash piles might just have something good this time


*TAKE* never expect something to be there when you come back (basic tools &amp; gloves &amp; a tarp for dirty stuff in the vehicle at all times)


*EXPLORE* rivers in old industrial parts of town can be a steel mine...be safe though!


*TALK* that old geezer who wants to talk your ear off---well it turns out he worked for an anvil manufacturer and tells of there being a row of anvils alongside the river bank when they closed the plant down (true tale!). A fellow selling oily car parts howdy'd me at a fleamarket. I didn't need car parts but it turns out his uncle wanted to sell an anvil---515# Fisher in mint condition for $350


*THINK* what businesses might have good stuff or come across good stuff---that knife made from a RR spike might be paid for in anvils when you make it for a scrap/junk dealer


*NEATNESS* leave the area nicer than when you arrive encourages businesses to call you to haul off good stuff to ""neaten up""


*SAFETY* gloves, boots even a hard hat comes in handy to let the owners not worry about you hurting yourself and sueing them...watch out for cars when you stop alongside the road for roadkill iron.


and lastly *CONSTANT VIGILANCE* I once ended up getting a 125# Peter Wright anvil and a 6"" post vise cause I noticed the vise leaning against a barn while doing a test drive on a car we were buying... I always ask folks with ""barn junk"" at the fleamarket about the heavy stuff they didn't bring...I spotted a keg down in the ditch near a RR crossing on the way to a smithing meeting---2/3 full of new HC spikes they were not willing to haul it back up the hill when they cleaned up after redoing the crossing---we were. Coming back from a Dr's visit the summer I had pneumonia I got my wife to stop the car and let me pick up the sledgehammer alongside the road---took me 1/2 and hour to catch my breath.

Since looking around here it looks like there are different areas to blacksmithing; it seems that what I'm interested in is primarily bladesmithing, but I'd also like to learn some casting.

Anyhow, I know NOTHING about smithing, other than that you need a good heat source (How hot?) to make the metal pliable, a good hammer and anvil (or flat hard object), and a lot of grinding...

How would I go about getting started and being able to craft some simple stuff? I've seen a lot of people posting about the forges they've made... could anybody link a good resource or instruction on how to build one? I know to people who can do it, it seems like ""a simple google search"" could grant me the info I need, but I've somehow never had a talent for finding reliable or pertinent info online, and advice from someone who's done it regarding good sources would be truly appreciated.

I live in the Houston area, I work all day during the week, so classes at the community college (also not one close, really) may be pretty difficult. I'm looking at this as a hobby, I want to be able to do it in off-time, but not really looking for something that will overtake mounds of time or have a very high start-up cost (hundreds)... If smithing isn't something that can be done like that, I'd still appreciate that advice, I may just need to look for something simpler.

     I have a senior project coming up, and we have to have an interview as one of our sources. Both for my paper, as well as my personal curiosity, I would appreciate it if one of you guys who is a professional blacksmith could answer a few interview questions for me.

Questions:
    
     1. What are the most common kinds of metal you work with (be technical)?
     2. Are there any different styles/methods of blacksmithing?
     3. How does science have a part in blacksmithing?
     4. Is art a big part of blacksmithing? How has science affected it?
     5. What are the different effects of the different temperatures when tempering metal?
     6. Is blacksmithing a well paying job?
     7. Is there a lot of math involved in the shaping and heating of the metal you use?
     8. Chemically, what makes metal brittle/flexible and how can you change it?
     9. Does it matter how you hit the metal? Does it have any effect on the final product (and why)?
     10. What are some of the best pieces you have made (please include some pictures if possible)?


These are the questions, and I hope they all make sense. Feel free to go off the deep end answering these. The more information I have, the better the project will be. Also, the topic is ""Blacksmithing: An Art and a Science"", so if you answer try and focus on those two specifically(art and science).

I am starting to put together a shop on a budget and wanted to get some more experienced opinions on an anvil. A local store has a 110lb anvil by King Tools &amp; Equipment for sale for only $189.99. It appears to have a hardened steel face on it after trying the hammer test to check on bounce. The hardy hole and horn are a little rough and might need cleaned up, but overall it does not look too bad. Right now, scrounging up $189 would be a stretch, but it might be worth it. I have a 2 foot section of railroad track I was planning on starting out with, but would this be much better? The reason I am questioning the purchase is that price seems very low for an anvil this size. Thanks for your help.

I have an old forge from the Canadian Blower &amp; Forge Co. The grill plate is cracked and a piece is missing. I have the missing piece, but it is too corroded to be of any use. I want to weld in a few plates to fix the gap, add a new grate (the old one is gone), and weld shut a crack in the plate (may not be able to see in the image).  

Since there are some old riveted patches on there, I wonder if there is a reason I cannot weld in new patches. Can I use a GMAW to weld/patch a forge? This is my first forge, I have built up a supply of charcoal and have an anvil coming this Saturday.

3. Would it benefit me to reinforce the narrow section of rail with some struts welded in there for more rigidity?  I was already planning to machine the ends square to give me a nice edge for folding.

Made the adze out of a railroad spike marked ""HC"". After heat treating it took an edge really well.. surprisingly it didn't dull much after 30min. working in soft wood. I figured it wouldn't really be usable since RR spikes don't have much carbon. 

Now time to make some chisels...

Bronze is very temperamental.  Forge it too hot, and it behaves ""like mashed potatoes"".  The appropriate heat is tomato-red, which if using a gas forge means turning down the burners as far as you can without losing the flame.  If it gets up to orange heat, let it cool to red before you try forging it.

It's a non-ferrous metal, so the heat treatment is like copper (which it's mostly composed of), rather than steel.  Bronze will work-harden even while hot, but you can feel this happen and you'll know when to put it back in the forge.  

When forging bronze, you can expect to spend about 40% more time on it than for mild steel.  This is mainly due to the increased care required.

Silicon bronze is available hard or half-hard, and the hard version will take the teeth off a bandsaw.  One place you can get it from is Atlas Metal in Colorado.  You can also get welding wire for bronze.  You should use argon as the shield gas, and you must preheat the piece to be welded.

Ok, that's all I know.  Hopefully it's enough to get someone started, and I'll post results if I ever get around to trying it myself.

One thing I forgot: Being a copper alloy, bronze is an even better conductor of heat than steel.  It's probably best to use tongs, rather than holding the ""cool"" end, which will not be cool at all.",,False,self,t5_2r2f0,True,,winner,True,t3_qg3ln,http://www.reddit.com/r/Blacksmith/comments/qg3ln/forging_silicon_bronze/,

Recently my son has become interested in knives/swords (as boys do), and came across the website budk.com. They have lots of knives and swords of varying prices (some under $10), but I have no way of knowing whether they are even worth buying. Some can be 10 times (or more) the price, but signed or part of a limited run.

The core of what I'm trying to understand is whether these sorts of blades are actually worth buying. Part of me wants to reject them as cheap crap, but another part of me figures it's possible that the process has been so automated or refined that it really could be possible to create decent quality knives or swords at a low price.

Is there something that should absolutely be avoided? Is there something to look for? My main concerns is whether a knife will be durable/sharp, and be suitable for hacking at stuff without falling apart. I know that some swords rattle or their handle comes loose with one whack at anything (clearly only custom/ornamental).

Should I be saving up for $100 knives/swords that look the same as a $20 one? Should I care if it's damascus steel vs. anything else?
