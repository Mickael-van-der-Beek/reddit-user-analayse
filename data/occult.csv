1332394758.0,96,self.occult,r806v,Occult 101: What it is and where to start.,,103,7,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/r806v/occult_101_what_it_is_and_where_to_start/,"The majority of posts to [/r/occult](/r/occult) tend to be from those looking for information on occultism and sometimes where and how to begin study and practice. With that in mind, I've written this primer as a very basic introduction to some of the concepts and principles of occultism. I'm not going to be able to touch on every individual path and school within occultism, but I will give a broad overview of most of the main currents. It is my intention to keep this free of bias and to be accurate as possible.

**What is occultism?**

The dictionary definition of ""occult"" means ""hidden"" or ""secret"". Occultism is the study of knowledge hidden or secreted away from the mainstream of society. However, modern parlance usually implies that this ""secreted"" and ""hidden"" state means ""not understood or accepted by mainstream society or the natural sciences"" rather than any notions of hidden cabals of occultists operating from the shadows of society. An occultist is somehow who studies or practices techniques utilizing this information often with the intent on creating change in him/herself or in reality via the art of magick. 

To give some examples: In a classical setting this may refer to the teachings of the Mystery Schools of Egypt or Greece. In a tribal/pastoral setting it would be the knowledge held by shamans, rootworkers, and cunning-men. In a modern light, occultism could be the psychonauts who explore the unknown regions of human consciousness and its untapped potential.

**Is it a religion?**

While some schools of occultism utilize or worship god-forms in their rituals, there is not a universal pantheon, deity, or even theology to which all occultists adhere to. Some occultists are quite devoted to a particular pantheon or god-form while some are completely atheistic. It goes without saying that we are not all Satanists or demon-worshipers out to steal your baby, slay your cat, or take over the world.

**What is magick?**

""the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will""

This is the quote thrown at those who wish to understand magick though it barely explains anything. In simplistic terms, magick is the ability to achieve a desire through indirect means through focused intent. The mechanics of how this desire is achieved varies according to the school of thought. Common explanations include divine/spiritual intervention, energy manipulation, parapsychology, psychology, and convoluted models based on chaos theory and quantum physics. 

**Is it real?**

To quote Nick Dutch, occultism is an experiential and experimental phenomena and anyone who gives you hard and fast answers regarding its ""reality"" is full of shit or trying to sell you something. 

Try some basic rituals and see what happens. Remember, the thinker thinks and the prover proves.

[Other users have also tackled this subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/r5h8w/the_burden_of_proof/) if you care to read it.


**Where do I start?**

Read and then read some more. Feel free to ask questions, but also remember that occultism is highly personal and no two practitioners will give the same answer. The first step, though, is to figure out what you are looking for. Are you interested in spiritual transformation or more interested in getting material results? Do you want to Rend the Veil of the Temple or pay homage to the Horned God and Lady of the Stars? Maybe you want to summon Cthulhu to give your asshole nightmares?

As long as you have mystery you have health; when you destroy mystery you create morbidity. The ordinary man has always been sane because the ordinary man has always been a mystic. He has permitted the twilight. He has always had one foot in earth and the other in fairyland. He has always left himself free to doubt his gods; but (unlike the agnostic of to-day) free also to believe in them. He has always cared more for truth than for consistency. If he saw two truths that seemed to contradict each other, he would take the two truths and contradiction along with them. His spiritual sight is stereoscopic, like his physical sight: he sees two different pictures at once and yet sees all the better for that. Thus, he has always believed that there was such a thing as fate, but such a thing as free will also. Thus, he believes that children were indeed the kingdom of heaven, but nevertheless ought to be obedient to the kingdom of earth. He admired youth because it was young and age because it was not. It is exactly this balance of apparent contradictions that has been the whole buoyancy of the healthy man. The whole secret of mysticism is this: that man can understand everything by the help of what he does not understand. The morbid logician seeks to make everything lucid, and succeeds in making everything mysterious. The mystic allows one thing to be mysterious, and everything else becomes lucid.""

Whereas at one time, ideas only existed within the mind of sole individuals and thus could not be shared with anyone else, all of a sudden, with the advent of language, people could entertain, comprehend, and share the exact same thought with one another, or if not the exact same thought, then at least one that seemed to resemble one's own. Truly this was the beginning of magic. For what word better describes this sublime transcendence of shared thought than *magic*?
 
From this language, this *Λόγος* (“*Logos*,” Greek for “word, logic, language, or meaning,”) developed our subsequent “*-ologies*,” branches of language which search deeper into *those categories which language itself necessarily produces*.  Psychology  (from the Greek *Ψύχη* “*Psyche*” or “spirit,” + “*Logos*,” *i.e.* the language of the spirit) and Mythology (from the Greek *Μὐθος* “*Mythos*” or “story,” + “*Logos*,” *i.e.* the language of stories,) were of the oldest manifestations of this magic. For they were the *-ologies* which described back onto themselves those two first things which combine to create language in the first place (the immanent *soul* and the transcendent *story*.)
 
Is it not therefore any wonder why our religious words and icons still carry so much metaphysical and transcendent relevance, even in an increasingly more atheistically centred *zeitgeist*? Those symbols and expressions, which we used indeed to communicate our youngest thoughts on *being* and *becoming*, are metaphoric of the relationship between our *psyches* and the rest of the world, and foundational to the more complex or evolved languages which were eventually to follow, like science or art.
 
Magic is real. It is the complex relationship between that which is transcendent (logic or ideas) and that which is immanent (being or reality). And when we see magic as what it is, rather than *hocus-pocus* or some other such humbuggery, then we can begin to use it, and become magicians.

1363511208.0,48,self.occult,1agh35,I just made a set of neurotransmitter correspondences/attributions for Crowley's tree of life. Thoughts? Critique?,raisondecalcul,54,6,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1agh35/i_just_made_a_set_of_neurotransmitter/,"Hi guys. I had been using testosterone vs. dopamine to explain the feeling of Mars vs. Jupiter (respectively), and I realized that there might be obvious attributions for all of the sephiroth with a major neurotransmitter system. After making this chart, I feel like I was right!

I made it by listing the major neurotransmitters, then going through the 4 suit cards in the Thoth tarot for each sephiroth and intuiting which neurotransmitter (and associated drugs) best fit the feel of the four cards as a set. I went through several rounds of this, doing some web research on the planets, neurotransmitters, and drugs as I went. It was a lot like filling in a crossword puzzle; as I became certain of some attributions, it made it easier to work with the remaining neurotransmitters and sephiroth.

I am not very happy with the way the post-Renaissance planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) have been added to the tree of life. For example, it feels very wrong to put Pluto at Kether (instead, I put it in Chokmah's qliphoth, the capitalist bastard; but I don't use the qliphoth except for that so far.) But the planetary associations actually worked out pretty well in this chart, except maybe for Saturn (and the Moon, but actually opiods are a great fit, it's just they are mostly very dark because you shouldn't use drugs to get moon energy.)

Anyway, after I completed the chart, I went to the major arcana and Crowley's attributions of them as pathways between sephiroth. I was surprised at how apt most of the pictures were at describing the feeling or result of combining the two neurotransmitter systems (or drugs in life). For example, the Moon represents how most people use alcohol in western culture--as an escape from everyday life and a way to channel oppressed subconscious impulses. The other major ways we move out of day-to-day life are aptly described by the other two cards--the Universe inspires us to go jogging and get a runners high, transcending everyday life in the pursuit of Beauty, or towards terrible addiction and conflict with society; and the Aeon moves us towards weed, in resistance to culture (as opposed to using alcohol as an escape).

Here it is. I was surprised at how it fell into place--I used all of the major neurotransmitters exactly once.

|Sephiroth|Neurotransmitter|Planet|Drugs|Feelings|

|2|Glutamate|Neptune|Ketamine, DXM, PCP, nitrous oxide, other dissociate anaesthetics (antagonists), antipsychotics (antagonist)|Basic neurotransmitter, low-level excitatory effects throughout the brain. Also ambiguity, multivalence, illusion, hypnosis, inspiration
|3|Oxytocin|Saturn|Orgasm, MDMA (indirect oxytocin release)|Pair bonding, unity, connection, belonging, affection
|4|Dopamine|Jupiter|Cocaine, crack cocaine, amphetamines, meth, also alcohol, nicotine, and all other drugs with a reward component|Mastery, management, control, coordinated movement, expansion
|5|Testosterone|Mars|Steroids|Territorial, aggressive, warlike, dominating
|6|Serotonin|Sun|LSD, mushrooms, other psychedelics, MDMA, MDA, SSRIs, some other antidepressants|Love, affection, wholeness, peace, intimacy, connection
|7|GABA|Venus|alcohol, benzodiazapenes, barbiturates|Sedation, drunkenness, uninhibited exuberance, stupor
|8|Cannabinoids|Mercury|Weed (also has paradoxical Neptune effects)|Fluidity, articulation, engagement, curiosity, indolence
|9|Opiods|Moon|Runner's high, opium, heroin, vicodin, oxycontin, other painkillers, salvia|Pleasure, freshness, energized peace, quietude, reassurance
|10|Acetylcholine|Earth|Nicotine, caffeine (but caffeine is an adenosine antagonist, not an Ach drug)|Ballin', the world of work and everyday life
|11 (Da'at)|Adrenaline &amp; noradrenaline|Uranus|Some antidepressants|Flight-or-fight response, fear, terror, panic, desperate aggression

Edit: Benzodiazapenes, barbiturates, SSRIs, and alcohol are the main drugs used as anxiolytics (anti-anxiety).

I am very interested hearing reactions to these attributions, because neuroscience and drug experiences give us fairly clear reference points by which to compare our understanding of the various sephiroth and their relations. Even if your understanding differs, we can have some interesting discussions as to why and how. I just did this for fun, and to explain the tree of life to neuroscientists, but I'm open to any and all critique :-).

So, what do you think? What would you switch around, and why?

Edit: I should add the testosterone is not a neurostransmitter, but it does capture the feeling I think. Ironically, testosterone does not occur in the brain (afaik)--instead, it crosses the blood-brain barrier as estrogen, and THAT masculinizes the brain during prenatal development. Edit: Woah, just realized that testosterone crosses the abyss to link to estrogen, as if the abyss were the blood-brain barrier. I'm now very satisfied with Estrogen's placement :-).

Edit: Forgot to add, estrogen is also not a neurotransmitter, but a family of hormones. Some estrogens either act as (=are) neurotransmitters in the brain or are transformed into specialized neurotransmitters in the brain (not sure which). Either way, it is interesting to note that the Column of Severity (left column) is all made up of categories of neurotransmitters/hormones, whereas the Column of Mercy (right column) is made up of all single neurotransmitters (I did not plan this). The center column, the Column of Mildness, is all single neurotransmitters except for Yesod (opiods is a category of neurotransmitters).

Edit: So, here's another reasonable set of attributions. I made these quickly based on discussions in the comments, but WITHOUT looking at the Thoth deck as I did the first time.

Benefits of this version:

* The center column now goes DMT-Serotonin (psychedelics)-Cannabinoids (weed)-GABA (alcohol and sedatives), which I think is a nicer progression via the Universe, Art, and High Priestess cards up the balanced center of the tree.

* Mercury is now associated with acetylcholine (nicotine). The feeling of nicotine is very much about ""articulation."" Also, Terry Pratchett always has his wizards smoking.

* For Netzach, the runner's high matches the Valour (7 of Wands) card well, and opiates do a good job of matching the two negative cards (Futility and Failure) for sevens.

* The moon has fewer negative connotations.

* The right column has glutamate (low-level excitatory neurotransmitter)-dopamine (rewarding)-and opiods (rewarding), so the lower two sephiroth at least have neurotransmitters who are strongly associated with reward systems in the brain (just a nice symmetry). Opiates are also literally the brain's way of declaring ""Victory."" However, opiates seem more constrictive than expansive to me, so I feel an incongruity here still.

* All the major axiolytics (benzos, barbs, SSRIs, alcohol) are now in the center column.

Overall I think the first version is better, especially after looking back at the Thoth deck.

What do you think of this version? Let's compare the two :-).

Edit: Cortisol needs to go on here, it is very important. It is a long-term stress hormone (stress, anxiety, depression, mourning), whereas adrenaline and noradrenaline are short-term stress hormones (fear, panic, aggression, rage).",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,1363860292.0,,,True,t3_1agh35,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1agh35/i_just_made_a_set_of_neurotransmitter/,

A syncretic system whose name is short-hand for the philosophical and temple teachings of Hellenistic Egypt. The central figure is that of Hermes Trismegitus - who is considered an incarnation of the gods Thoth (Tahuti) and Hermes - and the core teachings are his writings ""The Emerald Tablet"" and ""Corpus Hermeticum"".

The goal of Hermetic practice is enlightment through spiritual alchemy and theurgical ritual. There are also elements of practical magick and astrology involving the use of planetary talismans and horary charts. Hermetic magickal practices are the foundations for Renaissance European magick (via Agrippa) which went on to influence the Golden Dawn and ceremonial magick as a whole.

Strictly Hermetic groups tend to be occult groups of a ceremonial bent or esoteric orders. 

**Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (Ceremonial Magick)**

Combining elements of Hermetics, Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry, and Renaissance European magick, the Golden Dawn system is the foundation for most of what constitutes Western Occultism and ""high magick"". The Golden Dawn used a grade system similar to a fraternal lodge where the initiate progresses after demonstrating knowledge, ability, and the willingness to undertake various oaths of secrecy.  

The Golden Dawn teachings involve an intensive study of the Qabalah, tarot, and an extensive set of ornate rituals involving Christian, Jewish, Hellenistic, and Egyptian myth and symbolism. The goal of this path is spirtual perfection and the attainment of life goals.

There are a plethora of orders and groups still operating under the Golden Dawn name. Unfortunately, most of them also seem to be in constant conflict with each other over lineage and rights to the name and future of the system.

**Thelema**

The tradition founded by Aleister Crowley. Crowley, an intiate of the Golden Dawn, believed himself the Prophet of the New Aeon as fortold in Liber AL vel Legis or ""Book of the Law"". Crowley claimed this book was dictated to him by praeternatrual intelligence named ""Aiwass"". The book describes a procession of ""Aeons"" that mark different periods in human history and fortells the coming Aeon of Horus. Thelema is intened to be the new religion for the Aeon of Horus or The Crowned and Conquering Child. 

The Book is the source the infamous axiom ""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law."" This has been erroneously translated to ""do whatever you want"". In fact, the ""wilt"" here refers to the True Will, or highest purpose, inherent in every individual. The term can also be found in the commonly quoted definition of magick: ""The art and science of causing change in conformity with Will"". 

Thelemic cosmology has multiple god-forms, but the three most important are Nuit (Our Lady of the Stars), Hadit (The Solar God/Horus), and Ra-Hoor-Khuit (The Crowned and Conquering Child). Other gods mentioned in Thelemic rituals and works are Pan, Choronzon, Harpocrates, and Babalon, the Sacred Whore and her beastly mount Therion.

As Crowley was a GD intiate, Thelemic practices retain a lot similarities to that of the GD. Both involve intensive study of Qabalah, tarot, and various elaborate rituals for the intiate to master. Crowley was antagonistic to the church, so he removed a lot of Judeo-Christian language and symbolism from the rituals and replaced them with references to Thelemic cosmology. He also developed his own tarot deck, the ""Thoth"" deck, and wrote a companion book - The Book of Thoth - which is considered a classic text on the tarot. Thelema also places utilizes Eastern methods of mysticism and self-mastery like yoga, tantra, buddhist meditation, and sexual alchemy.

The goal of Thelema is knowing and being in alignment with your True Will. This is done through many methods, but the most commonly acknowledged is the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The Holy Guardian Angel, or higher self, is seen as the initiate's guide to knowing their True Will.

The two main organizations currently active in Thelema are the Ordo Templi Orientis and the A.'. A.'..

**Chaos Magick**

Chaos Magick is a system of magickal thought developed in the late 70's and into the early 80's by Peter J. Carroll and Ray Sherwin. CM borrows heavily from the DIY and anti-authoritarian ethos of punk rock, Discordianism and Robert Anton Wilson, quantum physics, chaos theroy, and the work of artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare.

Chaos Magick is practical, results-oriented magick. The Chaos Magick axiom ""Nothing is true, everything is permitted"" means that the Chaote should feel free to use any and all means to achieve results so long as it works. Ideas of spiritual perfection and enlightenment, overall, are not important to most Chaotes as they are with traditional high magicians. The principals behind CM are ""belief-shifting"", ""belief as a tool"", gnosis. 

Belief-shifting is the idea of utilizing all methods of magick regardless of the contradictions they may hold against each other for examples. These contradicitons are mitigated by the philosophy of ""belief as a tool"" or that the emotional and psychological investment in the ritual is more important than the words or actions performed. Gnosis is an altered state of consciousness likened to the Buddhist concept of ""samadhi"" in which the meditator achieves union with the Buddha-mind via complete mental vacuity. It is believed that the gnostic state of mind is where magick ""happens"". There are two kinds of gnostic trance: inhibitory and exciatory. The former is associated with sleeplessness, meditation, fasting, and hypnotic states. The later is associated with more active modes of trance like drumming, dance, sexual arousal, and flagellation. 

Carroll and Sherwin opened a fraternal order called the Illuminates of Thanateros which is one of the few magickal orders still heavily active today. The order has five degrees with initiate advancement based on demonstration of knowledge and ability. However, it can be reasonably stated that the majority portion of the CM community works alone or in self-formed groups.

**Neo-Paganism**

Mostly associated with Wicca, Neo-Paganism also includes Heathenry, Druidism, Neo-Shamanism, and various forms of contemporary Goddess theology. Neo-Pagans often stress that their path's are a religion first and a method of magick second. Neo-Paganism could also include traditions outside of the West such as Chinese folk religion or the various syncretic religions of Japan.

Neo-Pagans are the most visible and active members of the occult community. Most Unitarian Universalist churches have an ""Earth-Based Spirituality"" meeting group and there are dozens of large-scale festivals and celebrations that take place only a few hours away from even the remotest small town. There is also a cottage industry of publishers, record labels, and magazines devotes to Neo-Pagan topics and issues. Arguably, one could even say there is a whole city dedicated to it: Salem, Massachusetts. 

Outside of Druidism and Heathenry, most take an eclectic approach to magickal practices and freely borrow ideas from other spiritual traditions. It's not uncommon for some Wiccans to be involved in with practices outside of their tradition such as Reiki, yoga, or even Thelema. Druidism and Heathenry, however, are ""reconstructionist"" traditions that attempt to rebuild the old religious practices of a particular culture. In the case of Heathenry, it's the religion of the pagan Norse. In Druidism, that of the Iron Age Celtic priesthood. 

Most Wiccan groups tend to be private covens, but Druidism and Heathenry both have rather robust organizations in America or abroad. The most active orders in Druidism are Ár nDraíocht Féin, Reformed Druids of North America, and The Order of Bards, Ovates, and Druids in the U.K..  For Heathenry, there is The Ring of Troth and the Asatru Alliance both of which are based in the United States.

**Master:** Okay, let me get it out and we can get started.

**Seeker:** Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Just a second.  I'm not here to get on the thing, I'm just going to figure it out by asking you enough questions about it until I understand how it's done.

**Master:** Everyone says that.  The only way you can learn how to ride is to get on it.  You can ask questions all year long and you will fall off the first time you get on anyway, so let us cut through the chatter and you can learn how to ride it in about 2 hours.

**Seeker:** You don't understand, I'm *the one* who learns by asking questions, I never do anything, I just ask questions until I'm an expert at it.

Hi guys. I am the one who created this layout. You can all throw rocks at me here: /r/noahjk

Now I'm not really in a position to make style decisions that deviate from what I was told to do, but with this big of an outcry on the front page of /r/occult, us mods would be stupid to not do anything about it. What I suggest is you guys post what you think the subreddit should look like - any websites that look similar? Color schemes? etc. 

Here's what I was told to work with: 

 - http://www.occultofpersonality.net/

 - &gt;I tend towards darker themes

 - &gt;I opt for red and black or purple and black

 - &gt;A nice rich dark purple and black would look fantastic. Perhaps some images from old Hermetic texts or grimoires, too?

 - &gt;This question was put to the Oracle and the answer is ...Tetragrammaton as the main symbol (this is the current background)

Now obviously who made which comments isn't important and I'm not trying to say they were out of line for suggesting that. It's just not really that easy to make a nice-looking red and purple and black theme on a subreddit.

Before we have people unsubbing purely because of the stylesheet, it's extremely important we get your input. Please post away!

About a month ago I decided to make some changes in my life.

Fast forward to this past Tuesday I contacted a friend of a friend who's a professional blacksmith to commission a mace and glaive/halberd. Not only did we discuss my weapons but I've been offered a chance to go train in martial combat techniques involving staves, swords, and other old school weaponry, as well as take on a small blacksmithing apprenticeship. Add to this that I'll be joining the South African association that does this stuff under the title ""Marshall"" (Might as well have made it Martian.) to train others on the combat front.

1374182920.0,40,self.occult,1il6b4,becoming more skeptical of the skeptics.,cosmicprankster420,49,9,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1il6b4/becoming_more_skeptical_of_the_skeptics/,"let me start off by saying i have nothing wrong with the idea of skepticism, some times there is real bull shit we have to stray from. some people say skeptical materialists are dogmatic or akin to a religion of science, and at first i thought ""oh these are just some angry new agers trying to get back at atheists who have nothing to back themselves up, they must know something i dont"". dont get the wrong idea, i've never really been one of them, i've always been sort of on the fence neither beliving or disbelieving.

One person i've really been interested in is Rupert Sheldrake and his study of morphogenetic fields. I've listened to his lectures on youtube and heard about his experiements with dogs who know when there owners are coming home. i wanted this to be true, but didnt know much about his experiments and didnt know whether to beleive him or the skeptics who call him pseudoscientific.

Recently i've actually read dogs who know when there owners are coming home and got a chance to look at the study in finer detail. The whole idea of the experiments being pseudoscientifc were wrong, he did everything he was supposed to do in the scientific method such as random sampling, actually videotaping the events. he ruled out smell and sound of owners because they were too far away. he ruled out subtle body language cues from spouses because the spouse never knew when the person was coming home. and finally he ruled out routine because the owners would come home at random times of the day. he also did the study multiple times of thousands of different pet owners all showing repeatable results showing evidence for telepathy. to me, that sounded like he had everything well thought out and followed the scientific method exactly as you were supposed to. if you read the book, it seems pretty cut and dry and not people just making stuff up or faking it. We'll guess what, even with all that, its still not good enough for the skeptics. 

I've also been looking into a lot of other studys on the paranormal like telpathy, clairvoyance, and non local communication. I dont know the name of the study but quantum physicst amit goswammi talked about it on the joe rogan podcast. He tells of an experiment where two people were in these specialaized isolation chambers where no electromagnetic activity could enter. they hooked both these people up to an electroencephelograph to read their brain waves. one person was shown blinking lights at random times, the other was not shown blinking lights and was meditating on the intent of non local communication. they looked at the two people brainwave lead out at they matched up over 70% way beyond the margin of error. there apparently is a lot of experiements i found that do show some evidence of the paranormal

so why isnt this making news? why are they still clinging so hard to their worldview. perhaps these militant skeptics arent as neutral and objective as they claim to be, perhaps ideologically motivated. Skeptic Richard Dawkins invited Rupert Sheldrake on a debunking program. Sheldrake was under the impression that this was going to be a healthy debate, and he brought the evidence of his findings. it turns out dawkins didnt even look at his evidence.

or theres dean radins study on the ghanzfeld experiment which were also very well laid out. skeptic susan blackmore kept asking to further and further tighten the experiment, even though there were results beyond the margin of error.

It seems to me now that the militant atheists and cynical skeptics are not quite as neutral, objective, or even as scientific as they seem. keep in mind im not talking about all skeptics, just the dawkins and randi types. it seems perfectly clear they will reject anything thats associated with the paranormal or doesnt fit into the materialist paradigm regardless of how compelling the evidence is. so looking into this the idea of people calling these types of skeptics dogmatic, is looking more and more plausible. and science itself is not what is dogmatic, its just a method of inquiry, but people hide beyond the label and power of science to make their subjective claims appear to be objective. 

the worst part about the dogmatic skeptic phenomenon is these people dont seem to be interested in figuring out what is actually going on in the universe, 90% of their time seems to be devoted to laughing and pointing fingers at people who they think are wrong and making a circus show out of it.

true skepticism should never be mistaken for close mindedness and cynicism. afterall, terence mckenna took a skeptical approach but was still open to more weird ideas about the universe like the occult, shamanic plants, magic and so forth. suprising your r/atheist type redditor probably doesnt know that much more about science than the average person. end of rant

I became aquainted with the idea of Magick via Robert Anton Wilson and have become increasingly experimental in recent years. I am a scientist by profession and identify as 'non-religious' but I find the occult fascinating. I come to this stuff as a major skeptic.

I live in a major city and since christmas I have noticed that several books ordered from Amazon have disappeared from my mailbox. I originally had assumed that it was the action of junkies or an ex-girlfriend and wrote off the loss without any thought, but earlier this week when I was taking out the trash (communal dumpsters for my building reside in the basement) I noticed a copy of the most recent book that had been stolen from me was in the dumpster. [the book also had an occult theme](http://www.amazon.com/Apocalypse-Culture-Adam-Parfrey/dp/0922915059/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8). A month had elapsed between the estimated delivery date of the book and my discovery of it, which makes me really curios as to what is happening regarding my mail. 

At work that day I joked about planting booby trapped parcels in my mail with a colleague. When I went home I sampled a bottle of homebrew I had dedicated to Thoth in a half-baked chaos magick ritual and cast a sigil against the person who had been stealing my mail. I can't remember the exact wording of my magickal intent but made sure to keep it positive. Something like 'the person who is stealing my mail will see the error of their ways' and that I would see them getting this cosmic message. This morning as I left for work a bin was in the courtyard outside, the kind of bin people keep inside their flats. Walking past it I could see that the inside of with was covered in shit. It was disgusting. This incident is highly unusual, I think that the link between me finding my book in the dumpster and this person shitting in their bin may be related. Like the person has had a bout of somnambulistic incontinence.
 
**tl;dr somebody steals my mail, I hex them, it looks like my hex works**

Like I say, I come to this as a total skeptic; but the Jungian-style synchronicities are mounting up. **What strange occurences have you encountered in the search to meet your higher self?**

What I've realized is that it doesn't matter how it works, for the most part. It's a silly trap to get caught in the question of what is or isn't 'real' - that all depends on your point of view. What's more important is that these things work to some extent and whether I'm causing spirits to act in my interests, or I'm forcing probabilities in favor of my Will, or I'm learning to push buttons in my sub-conscious and have incredible self control...it doesn't matter. If you find yourself benefiting from the ideas in the occult, then do them. And if you're skeptical, try it. The worst thing is that nothing happens and you move on in your life.

Anyway, just some thoughts. I'm still not sure if I think this works in ways that aren't compatible with contemporary physicalist science or not, but it's definitely fun stuff to think about.

Edit: In this vein, the reason I don't think that understanding rationally/with language how it works when you start is important relates to the fact that I believe that as you experience it you will come to understand some very important concepts whether or not you can put what it is you learn by experimenting with the occult into words.

I've jumped around from a lot of different beleif systems, christianity, athiesm, buddhism, etc. I wanted answers to some of the mysteries in life, at least enough to feel secure and make sense of the world around me.

Science for awhile, seemed like it had all the answers, and it had evidence for many of the things in this universe. For awhile i would go through these back and forth feelings of beleif and disbeleif. I'd come up with an idea, and skeptics would counter it. 

But then one day, I had a really peculiar idea, that science still hasn't touched yet, and that is ""where the fuck does consciousness come from"". Yes neurology does explain that our emotions are connected to chemical reactions and our memories are stored in certain temporal lobes and how brain damage can destroy them. However, science never has, and i dont think they ever will, why we a random collection of organized atoms are self aware. Skeptics argue against this, saying you can program a robot to feel, processs info, store memories, create art, and even emotions. But you can never know for sure if that robot is aware of its own existance rather than a physical zombie, mimicking the symptoms of self awareness.

Isnt that the most peculiar thing? A bunch of carbon atoms, by bouncing and connecting in an exact sequence, become aware of their own existance? This has two implications, one, consciousness is a property inherant in all matter, or consciousness is something that exists outside of matter. I cant conceive of any other way, yet science says no and yes to both at the same time. This lead me to realize that sciences view of conciousness is totally paradoxical, even nonsensical. It says, no atoms are not conscious, they are just mindless billiard balls bouncing around, yet all we are made of these billiard balls according to science, and we, made entirely of unaware building blocks, are aware. WTF!?

The more i think about physicalism, the more absurd it seems. It has no explanation for consciousness, and the ones it tries to imply seem rather weak and more based on assumption. According to qunatum physics, there really is no such thing as solid matter anyway, its made of waves of energy. So i'm starting to see the world as more of a thing made of ideas and language, and instead of beleiving i found it is better to revel in mystery, and understanding that consciousness, not matter, is the underlying nature of reality.

so seeing from this worldview, if the world of consciousness and imagination is real in some way, it opens the doors for some strange things like magic.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,False,,,True,t3_zkj0y,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/zkj0y/what_got_me_more_open_minded_about_the_occult_and/,

The purpose of the letter is to draw in anyone who is curious enough to put the CD in their computer, and to unlock all the texts on the CD and as much magic in general as possible for them. What do you think?

...

Dear curious reader,

Magic ≠ magic. Consciousness is magic. Text is alive. You are already an artist.

Welcome to the Internet School of Magic. This is your anti-official owl letter. In this folder you will find a small collection of the most powerful and accessible grimoires known to exist. It should be enough to get even the most grounded muggle started. What they didn't tell you in Harry Potter is that natural-born wizards are tricked into being muggles so that media corporations can feed on them. If you don't believe in magic (and by extension Art), consider this your wake-up call.

Magic is not True, but it is Real, and it works. We cannot escape physical reality (except via Tathagata), but we can change the meanings we ascribe to phenomena. Each of us must discover our own personal Mythology and codify it with personal symbols so that it becomes a personal Religion. This is the basis of magic.

There are all kinds of magic-users: artists, wizards, poets, sorcerers, mages, mavens, writers, renaissance scientists, mystics, programmers, designers, logicians, planeswalkers, shamans, polymaths, psychologists, linguists, phenomenologists, hermeneuticists. Some of these terms (especially scientist, psychologist, programmer, designer, and logician) have become corrupted by the System and applied to people who perform merely an oppressive parody of the original magical style. Which kinds of magic-user are you?

Most magic occurs in the imagination, but that doesn't mean it is not real, powerful, and dangerous. Many people throughout history have gone mad from uncritical use of magic, for example Fundamentalists. Also, weird shit like quantum-entangled minds seems to be real. Follow the yellow brick road of numinosity (or if you prefer, your white rabbit).

Write down your dreams and begin to notice the patterns. Try assuming the principle of nonidentity, or i ≠ i (the key to all magic). What is Love? What is Time? What is Color? What is Affect? What is ethics? What is epistemology? What is metaphysics? What is mathematics? What is phenomenology? What is non-representationalism? Most importantly, what is Presence, and what is Subjectivity?

You will find it helpful to refer to an etymological dictionary during your studies. Since modernity, the meaning of many, many words has been semantically inverted by the System. Recovering the true meaning of each syllable will unlock these texts for you. Do not forget this or you will skim superficially and project your own delusions and insecurities onto the text.

Advanced students will find gematrix.com particularly helpful in divination, flying, and abyss-crossing. It does the number-crunching for you and is socially-based; it is gematria on crack. Of course, in this case projecting your delusions is the whole point. This is a dangerously effective method for seeing it; you’ve been warned.

There's lots more where this came from. If you would like to meet the other students and continue your studies in the Invisible College, please contact @deicidus. In any case, watch for signs of the Awakening. Shit's fucked up and we need your help with the Project.

The etymology of “to educate” is “to lead out”—but out of what? One of the most powerful arcane exercises is to think of your favorite books, movies, and videogames from childhood. Unlock their esoteric meaning by reading them as allegories that articulate occult principles via detailed analogics. The difficulty in interpretation is in finding the correct referents for each signifier in the analogical structure of the narrative. Children naturally love the Good, and all good stories contain a seed of Truth.

May you recognize and fight oppression in all of its forms. Never forget that other people are just as real as you, and have their own, usually separate reality. Egos constrain us, but they are also what make us beautiful and unique. Do not step on the flowers.

Enjoy the books. And please, distribute copies of this curriculum.

I'd appreciate any thoughts, responses, critiques, or suggestions of additions to this letter. Also, any suggested books for the CD? I'm going to keep it small, only the very best, most advanced, most accessible books are going into it.

Also, note the acrostic in the block of titles at the end :-P.

[Here are the books I have chosen so far for the CD.](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bz4MYv32sIrfT28zdGZ1amJBRzA&amp;usp=sharing)

Edit: Sorry everyone! Looks like the Google Drive link isn't working anymore. I suspect there was a switch that got tripped to prevent massive sharing via Google's servers. PM me your email address and I will send you the books :-).

I've been delighted by the response! Thank you everyone for the feedback, critique, and thoughtful book suggestions! Expect a treatise in the next month or so on the geometry of experience, awareness, critical consciousness, context, and perspective! (I just solved the problem yesterday!!! Occam's razor boo-yah!)

Ever since I first learned about magick I always wondered if there was some way to utilize computers.

I was pretty disappointed when the Chaos Magicians who were the most likely candidates for coming with something like this but didn't get around to it.

The computer and the internet have completely changed society and many many domains of it but magick seems untouched by it other then the released of wast works that are hard to decipher and are severely weakened without initiation. Although they did create more powerful and easy systems as a result.

I know there is cybermancers out there but they more utilize the concepts as a system of belief akin to the Matrix movie rather then the tool itself.

So what I'm asking is if any of you have ideas or sites or programs that utilize the power of the computer and the internet to power up magick?

I also have a great idea guys.(famous last words)

You all know how sigils work, but you may have heard supersigils like a comic book used as a sigil powered by the imagination of its readers. Or you may heard the story of Fotamecus who was used by many eventually transforming into a more powerful form.

My idea is to have a place where we can all power each others sigils on a you scratch my back I scratch yours, of course you can invoke it on yourself if you wish, we can also design sigils together.

Everyone can power the sigils however they think best, even simply looking at them or making a small prayer should be effective since it would make ripples beyond your individual censors.

Would anyone be interested in this kind of subreddit?

I was into the high magic at first but almost gave up on it before trying my hand at witchcraft.  The vast bulk of my magical success has been in doing simple, spur-of-the-moment acts of sorcery.  For example:

* Stabbed a drunk, scummy guy's footprint with a pocketknife.  He got a DUI the next day.
* Set up a matchbook to time-burn a dollar bill.  I drummed and chanted over it, commencing in an orgiastic finish as it caught fire.  My financial worries soon started to vanish as it made my whole perception of money change.
* Dressed an appropriately colored candle with oil and carved my intention for a specific job into it the night before my interview.  I chanted over it, fell asleep, woke up to it being spent the next day.  I had no business getting that job as I had a nasty, slow-healing wound on my face and no similar work experience, but I got it and beat the odds.  The whole day felt automatic and dreamlike.

Please tell me there are others on here who practice in this way.  I'd love to hear your successes.

If we know anything about organized religion it uses ideas and symbols to control and indoctrinate people. Magick and occult practices on an individual level uses ideas and symbols to free a persons mind and allows them to look at things from different perspectives to gain knowledge. If the goal of religion is to keep people ignorant, submissive, and controlled than the knowledge of magic and estoeric practices is just as much a threat to blind faith as the knowledge of science and evolution are to blind faith.

-------------------------------


Picture a world where a certain miracle happens regularly. Some people are deeply impressed, but another group decides to call that miracle ""zibzab"". Whenever they use this word, they say it dismissively. The word ""zibzab"" catches on, and soon everybody is using it. 

In this imaginary world, the miracle is actually happening right in front of their eyes. When an astonished outsider points this out, saying, ""look at that miracle!,"" the locals all roll their eyes and say, ""it's merely zibzab"".

**This same phenomenon has happened with the word ""placebo""**.

 People seem think that calling something a placebo means that we shouldn't pay attention to it. It isn't worthy of notice. Yet, clearly and obviously, the placebo effect is demonstrable proof of the power of the mind to influence the body. One need only look at Wim Hof and the Tummo monks to see a clear example. And, as Robert Anton Wilson points out in *Prometheus Rising*, it's not a big surprise that if someone believes a benevolent god is showering them with love all day, they can end up healed of their ailments (of course, when someone doesn't understand the principle of belief and they try to ""faith heal"" their child who has no belief in their god nor any skill in the ways of the mind, that kid is *fuckin' DEAD*).

 

Placebo effect is the holy grail, and the philosopher's stone. And people have made it a dirty word, a word only fit to be spit on. Whenever someone says ""it's *just* placebo, or *merely* placebo"", I can't help but think they are a fool.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,False,,,True,t3_1iqcx9,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1iqcx9/zibzab_the_placebo_effect/,

for example if i want a monkey to appear, i dont just look at the ground and hope for a monkey to appear by thinknig about it, instead i get a bunch of bannanas and lure the monkey into the dreamscape. or if you ever have a nightmare, you notice a monster never materializes out of thin air, it always comes through a door or pops out from behind something.

by having some kind of object, action, or ritual, its much easier for something to take shape in a lucid dream than just wanting it to happen. so in a lucid dream, you essentially use magic to create change just like in this world. I've learned its difficult to control things to my whim in this material plane, but i learned that dreamworld can be equally unyielding and stubborn even though its much more random. thats when i realized that magick is not about controlling the universe, rather it is  about guiding it in a certain direction.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,False,,,True,t3_1jfpnp,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1jfpnp/how_getting_results_in_lucid_dreams_helps_me/,

Low magic is deemed low because it is centered on the visceral, feminine, left-handed, lunar, emotive, naturalistic, Dionysian, rhythmic, hedonistic, and orgiastic experience.  High Magic is deemed high because it is masculine, solar, right handed, structured, ritualistic, concentrated, Appolonian, visual, abstinent, meditative, and sensory deprived.  So called black and white magic often fall along the same divisions (black/yin/feminine, white/yang/masculine) with the added implication that black is morally bad and white morally good.  Chaos Magic is not ""high or low"" but rather a paradigm in which taboos are removed and any of these methods may be used as long as results are achieved.  High magic paradigms include Golden Dawn (notice the solar motif?), most Judeo-Christian paradigms, Ritual Magic, Cabalistic Magic, Thelema, Hermeticism, and Buddhist stuff.  Low magic paradigms include Witchcraft, Wicca, Shamanism, Voodoo, Brujerias, Tantra, Folk Magic, and Sorcery.  High magic is the mark of paternal, sun-worshipping societies and their priests who supplanted the tribal, maternal, moon-reverent people.  These people would typically go to a witch, witchdoctor, or shaman for their spiritual needs.  
The interesting thing is that these two sides are constantly changing into one another in the eternal struggle called life.  Remember, gender is in everything.

I chose to begin in the corpse yoga pose, and simply relaxed and followed my breath.  I began to feel energy moving through my body, especially around my forehead area.  I had no idea how long I was meditating for but it felt very good.  Suddenly, my cat scratched the door and wanted in, so I let him in.  When I laid back down I attempted to meditate again, but was feeling very sleepy.  I ""think"" I fell asleep and this is where things began getting unexplainable.
I believe I entered a dream, but I was still meditating.  I believe the dream was lucid because I had no problem choosing to meditate, and everything seemed as it normally was.  Suddenly, I began to feel the most intense vibration I've ever experienced in my head.  It felt like it was going to vibrate out of this plane of existance (if that makes any sense).  My vision began to blur and I saw random faces, shapes, etc. Then the intense vibration spread throughout the rest of my body, and I could feel it especially in my hands.  The best way to describe the feeling was an intense electrical energy coursing through my veins, to the point where it consumed my entire being. (Granted, it didn't feel like an electric shock).  
Then I began walking around with this intense feeling still at full force, and went out into the living room (I live in a two bedroom apartment with a roommate).  I saw my roommate and his friend sitting on the couch, but they didn't seem to notice me completely.  At this point everything had a bluish, vibrational tint to it, basically it seemed very different from real life, though it was hard to distinguish completely between the two.  I began noticing that the energy seemed to pulse out of my body at my chakras and hands.  I then made my way to the bathroom when I decided to see if the energy pouring from my body could influence the world.  I put my had near the door knob and much to my surprise the energy poured out and moved the door without my touching it.  Amazed at this, I got another intense vibration in my head and the next thing I know I am slowly waking up in my room again.  Very befuddled, I came here to share my story and see what others had to say.
If it is of any importance, I have just started doing yoga on my own recently.

In this video you will see a reclusive Taoist neigong master.

He is the heir to a 2500 year old Taoist Neigong school/system called ""Mo Pai""

There are rumored to be 10 such schools alive today.

Neigong means internal energy mastery (pronounced nay gung)

He never once charged any of his students a dime nor accepted donations from them. The same applied to his patients. He was oath bound not to charge or profit in any way from his practice.

Since this video aired he has retired and the school was closed to western students.

He is now training as a recluse.

In this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoOgZsQGQpA

Catherine Nixon Cooke of the Mind Science Foundation

Dr. Roger Nelson M.D.

Dr. Greg Simpson - Physicist from (at that time) New York's Albert Einstein University

He is checked for metal in his body and stripped to a shirt before testing begins.

Home video of his student Jim McMillian passing his level 3 exam: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKuXuDCPfds

Earlier footage of him from the 80's: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg16FenuHmI

If would like more information there are two books by Chang's student Kosta Danaos (The Magus of Java, and Nei Kung)

Also the most advanced western student Jim McMillian recently wrote a book available on amazon (Seeking the master of mo pai)

For anyone who still thinks this is BS. The mo pai neigong meditation is very similar to a very well documented school called Buddhist Tummo or (inner fire meditation)

http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/04.18/09-tummo.html *During visits to remote monasteries in the 1980s, Benson and his team studied monks living in the Himalayan Mountains who could, by g Tum-mo meditation, raise the temperatures of their fingers and toes by as much as 17 degrees. It has yet to be determined how the monks are able to generate such heat.*

Wim Hof from the netherlands is one of the few non monks to have mastered Tummo. He holds more cold endurance records than any other person being packed in ice for 72 minutes to emerge hot to the touch, running a half marathon barefoot above the arctic circle mid winter, worlds longest swim under ice covered lake.

Look him up on youtube there are hundreds of videos of him.

Also, how do they relate to the more modern chaos magick hyper-relativistic paradigm. Is there any implicit reference to this, or is his magickal system based on a more rigid truth?

Is there more here than can be got from Initiation to Hermetics, The Mystical Qabalah, or a good book on Astrology?

It has inspired me to write down some curious things that have been happening to me over the past 5 months or so. I'm going to cross-post what I wrote there so maybe some of you (non-ufo/alien biased) guys can lend your two cents.

When I was a kid I had a few hallucinations/dreams/don'tknow events that involved small orangey-brown treasure troll looking people in robes being in my bedroom, waving at me, etc. I don't know much else about it aside from it scaring the shit out of me and making me feel uneasy about being alone through much of my childhood. Eventually I became wrapped up in UFO research because of the incredible story it was apparently trying to uncover, which of course lead to the abduction phenomena, and then down a bunch of diverging topics ranging from youtube videos warning of fallen angels, some of Aleister Crowley's work, to (imo) very loopy new age topics. I read it all while still trying to keep an objective mind, but I eventually started to figure that despite credible evidence like (well vetted) video and radar reports and Disclosure Project testimony, there was some much less physical aspects to the topic from what many people assume.

Within the past year my interest in the topic had gotten to a considerable point so one day while walking outside, I intentionally sent out a thought to the sky, something to the effect of ""please don't show up in my bedroom some night, I can't handle that, contact me in my dreams."" I have no idea what telepathy is or how to do it, but given what other people have said about this sort of thing, it seemed like the best way. I guess it's more like taking an entire intention or thought and packaging it into a single pulse, rather than stringing together words and sentences like a vocal language.
Well, that seemed to have worked, in some way. Soon after I began having a series of dreams. Not regular dreams per say; these didn't involve a bunch of disjointed events or a 3rd person perspective for instance. Rather, they all began with me, looking through my own eyes, standing in a particular place, often a low lit empty room of metal or grey stone substance. And I have always been able to wake from these dreams with a very vivid memory of the entire thing.
The first dream involved a typical short alien ""grey"" who embraced me in a hug. I sort of felt a vibrating feeling or a dematerialization of my body around my mind and said, ""sorry, I can't do this."" I immediately woke up to the daylight through my window. It was exciting, but a little creepy.

The second dream occurred about a week later. I was standing in a room, and far off on one side was a mask peering at me from around a corner. The best I can describe it as would be like the masks of comedy and tragedy in theater, except the eyes were steeply angled slits. It seemed to be looking at me like there was an intelligence behind it, but instead of indulging my curiosity and going toward it, I got creeped out and woke up. At this point I started sharing my stories on reddit, mostly this ufo sub. A guy private messaged me and warned me that they were demons, don't engage, invoke the name of Jesus if it happens again, etc.

So when the 3rd dream like this began, I was standing in the same featureless room, with the same short grey being in front of me. it had a hand outstretched and made a cautious movement toward me, but instead of being friendly I shouted to get back, Jesus Christ this, honesty that. Because, frankly, I was scared from too many creepy conspiracy theories and horror abduction accounts. I'm very curious about all this stuff about contact with nonhuman intelligences, but my frightening childhood experiences has really colored my expectations of all this. Another big sticking point is a potential connection to a being Aleister Crowley claimed to have contacted: http://www.boudillion.com/lam/lam.htm ...Which isn't necessarily bad by itself but it's a little too creepy to handle right now personally.

Honestly, I feel a little guilty about how I've been reacting to this stuff. Clearly, I wouldn't make a very good ambassador if there is indeed some kind of attempt at contact with something outside our scope of perception. the 4th and last dream I've had that I would lump into this topic occurred about two months ago. The oddness and clarity of the dream was the same, but this time instead of a stark empty room and a short grey dude, I was in what seemed to be a reception or lounge type of place. The room was round and had windows on all sides giving way to a wide view of perfect blue sky. There was comfortable furniture and many plants filling up the space. And on the opposite side of this seating area was a being who I can best describe as a yellow-skinned slender woman (I'm guessing woman, it was a female voice but no other characteristics like a bust under her clothing for instance), with white hair combed back over her large head, and large eyes that slitted vertically instead of horizontally like on our human faces. In retrospect, it seems these beings decided to put on a ""prettier"" face for me, and I did in fact react much friendlier. She told me her name... which I can only describe as something along the lines of Noall, Noel, Nohall... something like that, and that she was from Andromeda. She asked me about my clothing; why I was wearing the pants I was. (Khaki cargo pants, I said the pockets were useful for carrying stuff). She asked me a few very mundane questions and seemed happy, almost giggling with my answers. I kissed her on the cheek at one point and she said ""I read in books what that means for you people"" to which I replied, ""Don't read too far into that, some of us Earthlings are monogamous."" Either way, she seemed very happy from that kiss. I don't remember anything else from the dream, but it may be of note that instead of waking abruptly from this one as I had previously, I slept very soundly all night and woke up in a great mood and very energized.

A couple of interesting things I've come across since then:
-The troll people I saw when a child are a really close match to the short aliens from the movie ""Communion."" Mine didn't have such ugly faces, but rather looked like a Treasure Troll with a hooded robe on.
-I told the Noall story to a friend of mine, who said her name sounds similar to a word that means ""messenger"" in Aramaic.
-I looked up the word ""andromedan"" in google images and was pretty damned surprised at what other people say they look like.
-Rather recently, after all these dreams, I was sitting outside and thought/asked whoever might be listening to show me something to prove it's a reality. Nearly immediately, a white squashed marshmallow looking object appeared in the clear blue sky, and went over the sky and into some clouds while traveling in a lazy S sort of a path. I thought out a hardy ""Thank you! Let's talk in my dreams again some time!"" Though, I have not had anything of this sort happen to me since (about a month ago).

I have a few conclusions I can make about all this:
-It's bunk and I've been doped up on BS sci-fi hoaxers and claims crazy people make; this is all a result of wishful thinking and coincidence.
-There are intelligences who wish to make contact with humans and are (at least on the surface) much less scary than Unsolved Mysteries has lead us to believe.
-There are multiple types of intelligences that make contact with humans for varying reasons, and I happen to be lucky enough to have my ""calls"" picked up by some of the gentler ones.
-The human mind can be compartmentalized to the point of giving a separate personality to what would be perceived as a separate being, and in these dreams I was essentially interacting with another facet of myself.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,False,,,True,t3_pqfd6,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/pqfd6/dream_contact_with_beings_which_many_people_would/,

I don't post often but I've been wanting to do this for a while now (although a fellow occultist beat me to it a couple days ago), and over some time I've come to have quite a hefty collection of occult materials. 

I have accumulated over 155 GB of total files, which I feel is a significant amount and worthy to share. The files consist of mostly PDFs/text, along with audio, video and pictures. Some books are in picture form as well, because they could not be uploaded in a pdf by their original owner(s). (A quick note, some files have duplicates from crossover file transfers when being shared and being included in multiple collections, so don't mind that)

Some of these files are found in other places of course (like the well known occult text hosting services). However I have gathered a bunch from torrents, some that may not be up and running anymore and others from random people I have been in contact with. In all, there are topics on just about everything.

I have indexed all of these files into a single notepad (.txt) file and uploaded it to dropbox, which I will provide the link for. My goal with this is to see if anyone could use any specific files/collections that I have to help spread knowledge for everyone (sharing is important!). I can email them to you/upload them to dropbox or something. Any other suggestions for methods of distribution are welcomed. You don't need a dropbox account to download the text file. Additionally, while dropbox provides a fine viewing experience without necessarily needing to download it, some of the file names are long and go to multiple lines, so being able to fullscreen in notepad seems  to provide better viewing.

So yeah, that's pretty much it. I welcome all to take a look even if they're not looking for something specific; maybe I've got something that could be for you!

Thanks for reading, hope this can be of use to you guys.

Edit: As a disclaimer, I want to say that of course I have not been able to personally check over EVERY single file contained in this collection. Some people out there like to attach malicious code to PDFs and the like and proper precautions must be taken. 

You can never be too safe, and this will actually be beneficial to everyone even in the future. To protect yourself fully from PDFs (which most of these are) go into your adobe reader program, go to the 'edit' menu and click 'preferences' at the bottom. Then click on 'javascript' and uncheck the box that says 'enable javascript' and press 'ok' to finish up.

1375110105.0,29,self.occult,1ja25v,Laws of Magick - computational reference,dirk_bruere,34,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1ja25v/laws_of_magick_computational_reference/,"The list is below. I put it together not because I believe it but because this is a good summary of what many people involved in magick believe. Like in Chaos magick, belief is the important ingredient.


Appendix C – The Laws of Magick

These are culled from various sources and included for reference. While I have attempted a complete list it is probable that some have been omitted or overlooked. In no particular order:

Law of Contagion – once two objects have been in contact a permanent link is established between them.

Law of Similarity – like affects like.

Law of Association – if two objects have features in common they interact via those features

Law of Names – knowing the true name of something or someone gives the knower power over it/them.

Law of Identification – assuming some or all of the characteristics of an entity or phenomenon will create insights into its nature.

Law of Knowledge – with understanding comes power and control. This is a truism in all endeavors.

Law of Words of Power – the use of specific words to evoke a defined effect or mental state in the speaker or listener.

Law of Opposites – a synthesis of opposites will yield a third way that is not a compromise of the original two. Used in mysticism to hold opposite views or ideas in order to generate new insights. For example, a one dimensional polarity can be extended into a two dimensional diagram to provide a radical new direction. 

Law of Polarity – all phenomena can be divided into at least two opposing aspects. For example, temperature can be divided into hot and cold.

Law of Balance – this corresponds to the Middle Way in Buddhism and is used to keep the practitioner centered.

Law of Infinite Data – there is an infinity of information. 

Law of Finite Apprehension – we can only access a finite quantity of information.

Law of Infinite Views – every observer sees a different reality

Law of Creation – we create our own reality

Law of Pragmatism – Truth is determined by utility

Law of Cause and Effect – doing the same thing under the same conditions will produce the same result

Law of Self Similarity – reality is fractal and self similar on all scales. In other words, as above, so below.

Law of Synchronicity – there is no such thing as coincidence.

Law of Personification – any phenomenon may be considered to be alive and have a personality, and one may interact with it as such.

Law of Unity – all phenomena, past present and future, are linked into an undivided whole

Some of the laws have obvious parallels in programming languages, but
others are going to need a more creative approach

It seems more and more obvious that basically all human/political/economic/logistical systems are pretty much top heavy and loaded with obsolete, non-functional and self-antiquating/antiquated mechanisms.

I am not looking for a political discussion necessarily, the perception of massive chaos/failure seems to be ubiquitous and global. Certain factions blame it on their enemies or on behalf of
Whoever pays them most etc. What's telling is that at this point all stripes of political persuasion agree *something* is very wrong. 15 years ago much of our problems were ""conspiracy theories"". That is rapidly changing. 

People are being herded into their avatars. Now in 50-60 years this may indeed payoff but for now, peoples social lives are being radically restricted and this restriction is being sustained by the enchanting novelty of the merger of technology and media and their becoming a ""two-way"" street.

We have the ""race for the cure"" for breast cancer, this
Cancer that cancer but we do not have a sustained educational message informing people what is most likely to cause cancer because this information would be detrimental to large corporations that make food as well as damage the influx of people
In need of lifelong medical care, big pharmaceutical medicines etc.

So there may indeed be cures on the horizon for many things but at the same time, those cures will be high atop a hierarchy of noise, disinfo, chemically diseased foods, etc.

Same with society being sucked into this (for now) pin prick sized hole of the virtual. Line up and get your awkward clunky avatars kids!

At some point avatar culture, the virtual
World will be mind bending. But the truly advanced and progressive realms of the virtual will also sit atop a massive hierarchy.

We can easily make a PKD type gnostic argument about archons and matrices, the system, the ""man"".

In the words of the venerable millionaire lebowski ""the god damn plane has crashed into the mountain"".

I guess my question is: what does it look like to you? What is the way out?

Or is it really an entrance? Are we perhaps entering back into a more sidereal astral realm via technology?

In other words are we being freed and enlightened or processed, trapped and herded or are we in potentia of both awaiting the bifurcation?

Ramsay Dukes ""virtual reality"" perspective comes to mind as does the tibetan Buddhist viewpoint. Quantum physics is leading us to an untapped world of total potential, total probability.

It's obviously natural to fear this level of total
Technological
Integration.

But I think the reason why many fear it so is because since the beginning of recorded history, all
Of human society has functioned on the premise of fear, loss, scarcity, debt and lack. It is in direct opposition to the wasteful abundance of natures way.

As we as both individuals and societies reach our maximum human limits in the realm of information, data, time
and obligation management, it appears we are being pushed, as *humans*, past our limited natural boundaries in that a potential is being requested of us that we literally cannot at this time *afford* to manifest. So either humans must change or the meta-foundations of what we really ""owe"" must change. I say it will be a lot of both...but when? How?

There simply aren't enough hours in the day to continue to casually adopt more as more faux needs, quasi-commitments and payment plans.

The whole thing is maxed and here we are on the potential cusp of ""post-scarcity"" which is the exact opposite of how human culture has always been managed and it is my opinion that the corporate/governmental/banking dr.science.priests are fully aware of this liminal realm we are floating in hence all the draconian ""the customer is our enemy our competitor is our friend"" laws being passed everywhere.

I guess my take is, if we don't USE thetechnology tp liberate ourselves of the scarcity management paradigm, it will naturally, as a matter of course, enslave us.

Which is what everyone is really feeling.

Real time, instantaneous and ubiquitous communication technology is forcibly making everyone aware of our limitations, it's potential and the total obsolescence of the cultural institutions, but it is doing so by means of its shadow.

A lot of this will be connected with the tarot, as it has been my longest-running occult practice and focus of study for almost three years. The deck is the AC-LFH Thoth deck.

Since I've began, my perception of events and experiences has shifted (and is yet shifting) into essentially viewing my life from the lens of symbols. The tarot is probably the biggest single repository of symbols I make use of, but I use what resonates with me, usually. In any case, this year has been marked by Atu XI, as everything has been in this amazing upswing. I lived in an income sharing community and learned many valuable lessons; had a Divine Moment of Truth; I got to go on an amazing and fantastic bicycle trip with some of my favorite comrades; I was randomly invited to live in a highly desirable artist/performer community; got a wonderful and easy job as a bicycle courier; am giving a presentation on my earthly practical studies at a festival/gathering; have found many new interesting, open-eyed friends; have taken up new hobbies; have a couple of business models bubbling in the cauldron; and have on the day-to-day observed many minor synchronicities, reconnections, and gifts from the universe. Many of these things seemingly just fell into my lap, or struck me like lightning. 

What I have learned is that any experience, good or bad, has many lessons tied into it. Every choice is a crossroad of experience. I am learning more and more about how the tarot frames the experiences, much like a language of its own. Indeed, the language of experience. The language of life. Yet this language is universal in quality. It has been the it utmost faithful companion: it has alerted me of my follies, both in my endeavors and attitudes. It has also facilitated acute awareness of opportunities and dangers. I often approach it actively, focuses here in the present, to find obscure perspectives to assist me in my choices. I have found that attachments to outcome interfere with experiencing the raw awesomeness of magick.

I am wary of speaking of all this, as it is not my preference to seem arrogant nor boastful. I just find it all incredible and I well up with gratitude and excitement when I think about it. And mostly, I wish to share feelings of encouragement to seekers everywhere. 

All be Blessed. Embrace the mystery!",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,1351797341.0,,,True,t3_12godg,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/12godg/feel_like_im_in_a_whirlwind_of_magick/,

1339312763.0,27,self.occult,uucil,Do any of you have an interest in participating in spiritual 'activism'?,Polydeuces,28,1,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/uucil/do_any_of_you_have_an_interest_in_participating/,"Get ready for a long post! TL;DR at the end, here. 

I know that viewpoints on consciousness and existence vary wildly here, but I think many people here may feel similarly to me in that there are subtle forces at work in the world around us. I have been thinking a lot lately about participating in what the English language might call, 'spiritual activism.' I think that social forces such as the government and its linked institutions have proven unresponsive to much of the activism that seeks to alter them, and perhaps the effort must be made in a holistic sense. Whether its rituals, prayer, astral/shamanic work, leaving physical objects of power... You get the picture.

While I am interested in hearing people's general opinions, I will cut to the chase with my motives of making this post: I have some experience with long-distance bicycling, and am planning on taking an indefinite bicycle... 'mission.' I am interested in opening the channel of communication and collaboration with any interested entities who truly seek to put their energy into making life better for all beings on this planet. I am definitely interested in having some company on the road and mutual spiritual encouragement. 

One may ask, ""Why would I ever want to get on a bicycle and ride from state-to-state?"" Well, there are many reasons beyond the simple obvious ones of being outside, exercising, enjoying spectacular roads at a leisurely pace, feeling the wind in your air and the ecstatic sense of freedom. 
**1.** There is an alternative undercurrent in America which is a beautiful network of people, and riding a bicycle is a fantastic way to integrate them into your reality. WWOOF farms, intentional communities, (they're awesome!) cooperative/punk houses, squats, couchsurfing hosts, warmshowers hosts, friendly folks... 
**2.** Living on a bicycle is inspiring. I just got back from a tour of 560 miles, and I can say from first-hand experience that people are *really* into helping you out. I was in a small group most of the way, and people would give us cash, feed us, churches would let us stay inside when the weather was bad. People would even invite us over and let us stay, and we would have met them for only a few minutes! For me, it helps me look at the world and people in a whole new way.
**3.** There are not nearly as many distractions whilst traveling as there are in daily contemporary life. Much of the time, one can enjoy quiet and focus on themselves and small personal projects. (writing, reading, playing instruments, spiritual practice)

There are plenty of other reasons which you may discover, should you decide something like this calls to you. Practical skills that I can impart some knowledge of would be bicycle care and maintenance and elements of permaculture design. I am hoping to get my teacher's license soon and would be happy to take folks under my tutelage for that discipline. 

Allow me to be clear, however: I do not see myself as any kind of prophet or guru as this post may possibly have previously insinuated. I am not interested in any kind of hierarchical malarkey. I am simply doing something, and am inviting others with kindred interests to join me for however long they see fit. If you have an interest or any questions, don't hesitate to PM me!

TL;DR: I'm going on a mystical bicycle trip. Do you want to come? :)

I'm fairly scientific minded; I believe everything should be backed up with a preponderance of evidence.

As such, I know nothing about it, and I'd *like* to, if only so I can understand and chat with them.

Basics I know? Occult means 'secret'; originally science was considered to be occult. It's believed to be hidden knowledge. I also hear some stuff about fae, magick, and the like, though I dismiss it.

Even so, I feel like there's so much third- and fourth-hand material floating around here that I'd like to hear about success stories that you or someone you know in person has experienced through the practice of magic or the occult, broadly defined. If you say it happened, does that prove it happened? No; but share your story anyway, and be truthful to your experience. It goes without saying that not everyone will believe you, just as not everyone will believe me, but don't be shy. Disclaimer: the only proof here will be nothing. Nevertheless, I'd really like to hear what other people have to say. I'll try to start with my experiences.

1). I turned to tarot after the breakup of a recent relationship. It was pretty brutal; I wanted hope and a reason to believe it could work, and every answer I got was a more or less categorical no, no, no. I hated that message at the time but, in my opinion, it turned out to be accurate. A reader with much more experience later returned the same verdict.

2). I started keeping a dream journal and, for that relationship, found it to be very prophetic; I had a dream where I couldn't reach my ex-girlfriend by phone or any other way, since we'd broken up. Later on in the same dream I was on an island that people were telling me would flood, but I wouldn't get off of it. At the time a breakup seemed impossible, but all of this eventually came to pass; and while I know this is hardly the stuff of miracles, it was very meaningful to me.

In other significant dreams I saw Ganesh, and in a recent one a planetary sigil (I believe) came to me in the form of an arm tattoo.

3). I turned to the saints for help during this relationship. I'd heard that they could be effective in granting your petitions (as long as they were consistent with theirs), but that their help could sometimes prolong relationships that were headed for failure anyway. I believe that I received help from them, and I'm very grateful for it; at the same time, I think it's very likely that we would've ended earlier and more peacefully had I let it die gracefully. The relationship 'exploded' at the end, when it became clear it had been dragging on too long. Note: when I turned to them for help at the end, this time, the message was finally 'no.'

4). I briefly experienced astral projection in a dream. I 'woke up' inside of my body, wearing my clothes but somehow suspended in space. And when I say space, I really mean space - sort of floating in this field of stars, in blackness. I was only able to process it for a few seconds before I freaked out (where am I? what's holding me up???) and sort of 'vibrated' out of it; and that was the end of that.

5) Since I've started a regular spiritual practice, my life seems to be going more smoothly. This is, I know, the least dramatic of all the items I've listed here, but it's been a revelation for me.

1363836892.0,25,self.occult,1apmmp,"Let's talk about ego.  Yea, it's that time of the year again...",Nefandi,33,8,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1apmmp/lets_talk_about_ego_yea_its_that_time_of_the_year/,"People in spiritual circles often talk about ego, and usually in negative terms.  Usually ego is narrated as something undesirable and something that needs to be either dropped or dissolved.

The idea of ego comes from psychoanalysis, if I understand correctly.  But in psychoanalysis ego is a necessary and *healthy* function of personality and not something you'd want to drop.  So what is ego in psychoanalysis?

Ego is the portion of personality which *mediates* between *id*, *super-ego*, and *reality*.  Id is the desire to seek pleasure and avoid pain.  Super-ego is the social ideal.  Super-ego is what society (as opposed to an individual) holds desirable.  Kindness, generosity, patience, forgiveness and so on.  These ideal qualities represent or form the super-ego.  And reality is the notion that the world is external and physically regulated.  So for example, if you stick your hand into the fire and it burns, that's reality.  Reality is the ""harsh"" world ""out there.""  And conventionally most people probably do find the world to be both external and harsh.  And finally, ego is what *balances* these three concerns: id, super-ego and reality.

So in psychoanalytic terms, if you actually dropped your ego, you'd become dysfunctional in society and the world.  So if you're either dysfunctional now or strive to be someone who is at peace with dysfunction, then perhaps you can talk about dropping ego.  And keep in mind, if you drop your ego you still have the id and super-ego which aren't dropped. :)  Would you drop id and the super-ego as well?  All of this seems profoundly misguided in most scenarios, if not outright crazy.

Now let's look at ego in more metaphysical terms.  Is ego complex or simple?  In other words, is ego composed of parts?  If ego is composed of parts, it's complex.  Otherwise, it's simple.  But if ego is composed of parts, isn't it better to talk about these parts individually?  For example, *if* (if!) ego is greed + lust, and you still maintain lust at the same level but reduced your greed, then it's not informative to talk about dropping or not dropping ego.  It's not specific enough.  It's much better to say, ""I am now less greedy than I used to be.""  That's informative because it's specific.  If your mind recognizes a reduction in greed, but expresses that as ""I am now less egoistic than before"" that's much less precise and much less informative.

And if ego is not something complex, then does it really even exist?  Isn't a metaphysically simple personality entity an illusion?

What would you rather hear when discussing spiritual concerns:

""I've become less greedy"" OR ""I am less egoistic.""

""I've learned to be more patient."" OR ""I am less egoistic.""

""I've learned to keep an open mind.""  OR ""I am less egoistic.""

""Praise and blame no longer move me as they used to 5 years ago.""  OR ""I am less egoistic""

""I no longer view the world as external.  I don't feel that the subject/object distinction is informative or meaningful.""  OR ""I am less egoistic.""

Personally I'd much prefer the expressions on the left for two reasons.  One, they are more precise.  More specific.  And two, they have only very loose relations to one another.  So in other words, it's possible to become less greedy while still being very much attached to praise and blame.  So because these qualities can change individually without much affecting each other, it's much better and more skillful to talk about them individually instead of giving them an umbrella term ""ego.""

So in conclusion, I believe talking about ego is not the best way to talk about what's going on with you in terms of your spiritual evolution.

So what do you think?  Am I making any sense?  Have you ever been confused with the talk of ego like I have been?  Perhaps there are good and bad ways to use the word ""ego"" in conversation?  If yes, is there a situation where talking about ego is so precise that it cannot be expressed better as my examples above demonstrate?",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,1363840191.0,,,True,t3_1apmmp,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1apmmp/lets_talk_about_ego_yea_its_that_time_of_the_year/,

And it has, for some time, but recently it is working overtime to make my life miserable.

I suppose it would be fair to say that my subconscious is sabotaging me, because I'm not conscious of what is going on, but it is definitely ""negative magick"" that is pervading my life.   

If suicide were an option for me at this point in my life I would probably be weeks away from it.  

I'm posting here, because elsewhere I just get this: ""this is normal of a college graduate who just got over a breakup, sounds like you have manic depressive disorder, you need to see someone"".

I'm not sure how to get out.  How to figure out what I need to be doing with my life.  How to figure out how to be the person I want to be.  Everytime I try and take steps in the right direction I feel like I keep getting smacked down.

I've led an incredibly priviledged life which is part of my problem, but it's also a huge blessing.  Money is no object here.  My father has given me time to figure my shit out.   But things seem to be getting worse.


I'm sick and tired of burning time ""doing whatever"" hoping that I'll figure out what I want to do.

I'm sick and tired of becoming less and less of the person I want to be.  Although I have considered the possibility that I am actually becoming more and more of the person I want to be and I am getting resistance from people but I don't think this holds much truth to it.  

I'm sick and tired of not knowing what I believe.  This is both a blessing and a curse that comes with magick.  I feel like I believe in nearly anything and yet at the same time I doubt everything.   My occult work is a huge turnoff to the very people I seek i.e. agnostic/atheist individuals.  I'm not sure how to deal with this.

In a recent [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1edkge/my_first_lbrp/) I [suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1edkge/my_first_lbrp/c9zch6s) the idea of a subreddit dedicated to working through a Golden Dawn-style magickal curriculum together. The idea generated some enthusiasm. AiryMana created a new sub [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/emeraldcouncil/). The idea is to bring together people (like me!) who are new to this, and want to collectively follow a broad curriculum (Donald Michael Kraig and Chic Cicero's work have come up), with people who are more experienced and can offer guidance and teaching. 

  * I am fairly new-- I started working through Modern Magick in January. I've been supplementing it with John Michael Greer's books on Kabbalistic magick (Circles of Power and Paths of Wisdom) and with some of Israel Regardie's stuff, and also reading Lon Milo Duquette. I have the idea that we could work out a basic plan for everyone to follow with individual variations, and hold regular discussions on the various steps/lessons and also special ""workshops"" on specific topics (like Tarot, or zazen, or Crowley/Thelema). 

  * The idea that it could be more than a subreddit, but that the subreddit could be the basis for a new order has come up... I like that idea. 

  * But what to call the thing? I suggested r/WizardsAcademy. I liked it because it sounded nerdy and awesome. The response was... less than enthusiastic. Freesider suggested r/GDUniversity, and, of course, the subreddit that AiryMana actually created is called Emerald Council. 

If we're going to move forward (and I hope we are!) we need, I think, three things:

1. People! Including beginners, intermediates, and experienced occultists who are willing to shepherd neophytes.

2. A broad agreement about what specific path to follow. I was thinking we could pick 3 or 4 basic ""text books,"" (perhaps Modern Magick, Chic Cicero's Self-Initiation, Greer's Paths of Wisdom and Regardie's big Golden Dawn book?) with individuals able to craft a specific plan by either following one to the letter or combining aspects 

3. Rules! We'll need a structure both for the subreddit (moderation, etc) and for the larger program base in the subreddit.

Sorry about that.

Hello /r/occult, I've been interested in magic for a few years, I practice meditation and try to read a lot. I consider myself a novice chaos magician (Liber Null and Psychonaut is a fascinating read).

To give an example of my mindframe: I really resonated with a quote in the book ""All History moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God"" - James Joyce, *Ulysses*

I've always been interested in politics, and sparking a great political movement that would improve humanity on a psycho societal level has been one of my goals for years. I'm wondering if anyone knows of an area study focused on this particular goal. I'll be adding more to this post as I formulate my thoughts more concisely, I just wanted to get a something out there to start my learning and get some input.

I'm probably just your regular 20-something, discontent with the world how it currently seems and looking for meaning and purpose where I can find it. With economic instability, issues in the middle east, and a host of other problems the world is in a state of flux that is both frightening and exciting at the same time. The Chaos Mage portion of my psyche is telling me ""Take the Reigns! Be the Harbinger of the Next Age!"" And I think most people in my demographic and probably people outside of it feel similar. The trouble I have is finding an avenue that fulfills all of my post-adolescent desires for change.

I've chosen to apply myself through a weird intersection of magic, technology, and politics. These things interest me and I see blurred, indistinct ways to connect them. I figured the occult page would be the most likely subreddit to post this thought stream as it has a degree of openness that would help me continue my path and perhaps refine it to a sharper point. The internet is an amazing resource that allows ideas to spread and people to learn in the blink of an eye. These give me such hope for the future and I want to help as much as I can.

These urges come and go, probably a symptom of the instant-gratification age of the internet haha. I am slowly learning to harness my attention to improve myself. I read, I meditate. I learn. With the massive resource of the internet also comes the overflow of information. I feel like an artist or an athlete who has plateaued. I don't know where to go from here and I am looking for guidance. 

Thank you for your time and if it seems like I rambled then I apologize, I just wanted to make sure that I got as much of my thought process onto the post as I could.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,1362794318.0,,,True,t3_19xzfj,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/19xzfj/just_finished_wilsons_prometheus_rising_it_got_me/,

So i've been working on my own evocation for the past few weeks. Essentially the idea is to bring up some local entities of nature to come by and sit with me for a bit. Last night i had two takers, and i was curious if you guys had ever encountered or heard of anything similar.

So i invoked and sat there for several minutes, doing my best to be patient, when i suddenly realized that i was not alone. The way the shadows fell from the candle light was leaving an fairly distinct outline of something sitting across from me. It sat crosslegged (as i was), with long skinny arms and legs, skinny neck and a large bulbus head. Its limbs and neck were far too skinny to be human and it would clearly have been several feet taller than me if it'd been standing. It had a greenish hue around the edges.

Its form was not very static either. I asked it what it was and it gestured towards the candle. I asked if it was a being of fire and it...shrugged, then expanded to fill my vision. Like it was trying to communicate something larger, possibly air water related. Whatever it was representing it was large and dispersed. Anyone contact anything like this before?

The second presented itself to me (while the other was still sitting across from me) as some kind of old warrior spirit, possibly native american. It didnt really communicate by gesturing, but i could feel its presence moving around the room like a snake. It seemed to insist that it was once human, but something seemed wrong...almost like it was trying to tell me something it thought i wanted to hear. I became suspicious, and demanded that if it was speaking falsely, it come forth and be truthful or leave.

When i asked it to be truthful, it was immediately very angry. I could feel its intense anger pressing against my thoughts. I forced it off of my thoughts, bid a polite goodbye to the greenish being i'd been sitting with, and promptly performed my banishing.

In retrospect, i'm not sure whether I insulted the second being, or was correct in deducing its deception. I've never really been lied to by anything i've seen this way. Has anyone else? The rest of the evening was uneventful.

UPDATE: Consensus seems to be that I called up a Genius Loci and some kind of weak trickster. For thing 1, i definitely plan on trying to call it up again, that bro was chill. I'm going to meditate on thing 2, but i'll probably just leave it alone unless it comes back.

I'll try out the ritual a few more times on my own and then post it here for you guys to try. I should have time to do it again next week sometime. Honestly i'm pumped by the first run. It was a serious rush. I'm not really concerned about sharing it once its done since its geared towards your locale so everyone's experience should be different. Unless you guys are stalking me already after my first post.

By popular request, here is a little post detailing the *Hitsuki Shinji*, and an opportunity to ask its chief researcher and his translator questions.

*Hitsuki Shinji* consists of 38 books, totaling hundreds of chapters and about the length of the New Testament, which were produced by automatic writing in a script that looks like [this](http://pds.exblog.jp/pds/1/201104/18/67/b0191767_1151413.jpg). This is not what ordinary Japanese looks like, but is replete with numbers, like the Book of Heaven described by Swedenborg, and other symbols. So, a line could read like ""4tune comes 4th from 1ness of g0d"", except slightly harder to read for orthographic reasons. It was written over the years 1944-1959.

~~Nakaya-sensei is a busy guy and would rather write in Japanese than English, so I am going to translate and e-mail all questions to him which are not covered in this post **about 12 hours after I make this post**. Sorry if you miss the cut-off :(~~

## FAQs: Stuff we put in the vlog series

**What is the *Hitsuki Shinji*?**

Explained here: http://redd.it/10p2m7

**Hitsuki Shinji comes from the Japanese tradition of respect for the ancestors and nature, which is called ""Shinto"". What is the Shinto view of ""deity"", magic, etc?**

Nakaya-sensei's opinion is here: http://youtu.be/jzPvMTgipFg This is actually pretty standard information that you can find in English books like *Shinto: The Kami Way*, but Wikipedia has made a mess of it for some reason.

**Does Shinto have a tradition of One God?**

Historically, no, but recently there have been notable exceptions. Nakaya-sensei's thoughts on this are here: http://youtu.be/xOqvbn1IcMY and http://youtu.be/KcM0VqUGqBk I personally don't agree with him but I translated his words as best I can.

**How did the *Hitsuki Shinji* appear? What is the context?**

Explained here: http://youtu.be/v-z5zjCvZ5I Even though Nakaya-sensei's opinions on this use spiritual terms, I think you'll find they also make sense from a depth psychology or Jungian perspective, and he provides accurate information that most of the readers of this subreddit will find insightful.

## FAQs: Stuff that's not in the vlog series... yet

**What sort of stuff can be found in the *Hitsuki Shinji*?**

That's a big question...

It's a revelation from the God of Abraham and calls on Japanese people to conform to the ""Great Way"" of the world. It says that Japan will have a big role to play in the future and people will regret it if they don't adhere to divine principles.

It contains tons of prophecies about a coming economic and spiritual crisis, which will cause famine, war, and a population crash; one notable line states that ""all things will become one-third"" of their former size. It says that human beings were led astray from the traditional paths by occult forces, and need to be put right.

It explains the nature of the spiritual world and how it is that revelations are made.

I am doing research into alternate histories of ancient Japan which claim to be written hundreds or thousands of years before the official histories Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. The *Hitsuki Shinji* incorporates these and seems to explain why they were created. Feel free to ask me about these documents as well, or about Shinto in general.

**How popular is this?**

It's a major subject of the Japanese occult blogosphere and I see it all the time on Twitter, although I guess I follow weirdos.

**Why is there nothing written about this in English?**

That's kind of a mystery to me, considering how much New Age stuff gets translated into Japanese every day. I have found with my alternative histories, too, that very little has made it into English despite its very real relevance to occult research.

**Are there books about this subject written by skeptics/other people?**

There are only a handful of departments of religious studies in Japan, in Tokyo, and they seem to be interested in medieval society mostly. I've seen *Hitsuki Shinji* mentioned in an aside in some books, but there is no study of latter-day occult research circles in Japan as there is in America, so there's really no interest. You can find a list of other authors who talk about it [on Japanese Wikipedia](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%88%E7%A5%9E%E7%A4%BA#.E5.8F.82.E8.80.83.E6.96.87.E7.8C.AE).",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,1349151298.0,,,True,t3_10rg21,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/10rg21/ama_shinichi_nakaya_researcher_of_the_japanese/,

[For those not familiar with the concept, here is a short video by Nick Dutch that explains the fundamentals.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWfQqQhaX7w&amp;feature=related)  I would suggest watching his other videos as they are fantastic. I also assure you that they are not recorded on a potato like this one.

This proposal is completely open to suggestion, reinterpretation, and outright rejection. Nothing here is set in stone and is only intended to get the ball rolling. I want as many people as possible involved in this so achieving consensus in the method of ritual and creation is extremely important. 

**TL;DR:** Feel free to disagree and suggest other alternatives. All are welcome to take part be they Hermeticists, Chaotes, LHP, or even debunking rationalist Randi-lovers. It's a big bed and there is plenty of hot, sweaty, and awkwardly-fumbling love to be shared. 

**Proposal**

I propose we construct and empower the entity ROCULAPEGROS as the egregore spirit of r/occult.

In [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/xwafu/anyone_interested_in_a_group_ritual/) [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/xwafu/anyone_interested_in_a_group_ritual/), we discussed the idea of the members of /r/occult taking part in synchronized group ritual. The most feasible intent for the ritual put forward was the creation of egregoric entity for /r/occult. Many great ideas were put forward especially that of an ""astral teacher"" and/or a guardian of sorts. However, in the interest of experimentation - and practicality -I would suggest we construct the entity to be omni-functional and adaptable.

**Method**

In the vein of chaos magick, the ritual should largely be self-constructed. However, I would recommend borrowing from Goetic evocation by way of use of the Triangle of Art as its the most universally recognized way of evoking spirits to manifestation. Triangles are easily constructed (you can do it with construction paper, puff paints, and glitter if you like) and provide a great foundation for the rest of the ritual.

[Here's a video of Alan Chapman and Duncan Barford using a glo-stick Triangle of Art and LED candle circle for a Goetic evocation of Ronove, the 27th Goetic Spirit.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANSWuCuv5kY&amp;feature=g-user-u)

All banishing and temple/circle construction would be left to the individual. I do think we should have a collectively written evocation and charging. I'm terrible at being poetic, so I open the floor to anybody else willing to put forth ideas for this. The only suggestion I have in this regard is to not pull inspiration from the Goetia and it's notoriously long-winded conjurations. 

Feel free to discuss timing for auspicious days and circumstances. Full moons or Samhain? Crowleymas? How about Chaoflux or St. Tibs Day? Easter? Passover? Ramadan?

**Desired Result**

The creation of an experimental egregoric spirit representing the eclecticism of this sub. The spirit can be contacted by any means of spiritual contact and utilized for purposes ranging from protection to astral pathworking.

I can't understand Magic as anything other than a metaphor, and to take it literally seems to me as grave a mistake as taking the classical Christian notion of God literally. Is this the case? Is magic just an elaborate metaphor? Or am I missing something?

Edit: Conversation with you all has allowed me to express myself better. To clarify: The outside world and the inside world are both part of the same Oneness. Everything that we perceive as being 'outside' is really 'inside' as well, and vice versa. Everything is a metaphor for the psychical experience because everything IS the psychical experience.

My intuition has led me to the GD, so I picked up Cicero's Self-Initiation into the GD, and Kraig's Modern Magick. I am studying them both simultaneously.
Both books instructed, for my pre-inititation, to perform the LBRP, Adoration to the Lord, and Invocation of THEMIS twice a day for a month. Yesterday was my first attempt. I made sure to perform these rituals with a clear head and no expectations. When I had finished, I felt particularly light in weight. Like my legs and feet didn't weigh as much, making it easier to walk. That is enough evidence for me to continue. It seems that I began this post with no real point, and that I am probably just using this subreddit to express my findings, as anything occult isn't anything I like to converse about with the people that surround me daily. So I guess thanks for reading, and the help along the way. SO here's a question as to not make this post completely pointless. What should the LBRP (and other aformentioned rituals) be doing for me?

Can an occultist really practice without faith?  Even an ala carte system like Chaos requires at least temporary adherence to a set of beliefs.  Blind, unquestioning, stubborn faith is certainly a threat to intelligence, but I believe that faith is necessary for the success of almost every occult practice, whether it means faith in one's own abilities or faith in a goetic demon.  The passion of faith is a key mechanism of my magic.  A faithless ritual is an empty ritual.  
""...mystical rather than from rational or reasoned thinking""  As someone who applies the scientific method to my practices, I consider this inaccurate.  The methods of science, the goals of religion.  Almost any book on the subject will attempt to systematize and/or rationally explain occult phenomena. Whether a system is addressed in terms of psychology, a hierarchy of spirits, planetary positions, the law of attraction, or simply art and self expression, there is no shortage of attempts at reason in the occult world.

It felt very eerie that a man who dedicated his entire being to saving and drawing attention to things we often don't care about, animals big and small, had such negative final words. I woke up feeling very emotional about it, wrote it down, went to work, got on reddit and my front page was filled with subs commemorating him as apparently that day was his birthday.

My grandfather had been diagnosed with cancer and had been living for 5 months with it and according to the doctors possibly had a year left. In December I had a dream that he was going to die very soon and very quick, that his sudden decline would come by phone call and he would be dead within days. I told my family so that they would spend more time with him, we all went out to eat with him and within a week my father got a phone call while I was in the room with him explaining that his health was rapidly deteriorating. He died within days, his decline was so quick very similar to the dream. I have an identical similar story about my Grandmother, his wife, who had died 3 years prior, had been living with cancer for months, I had the dream she died, within days of that one she declined and died.

When I was in college I had a dream that I was in a school room, huddled down on the ground with several classmates. Everyone was very scared. I felt the presence of something intensely evil outside the room. That's when a gunman entered the room, shot a few of the people laying next to me, and proceeded to walk up to me and put a silenced uzi of some kind up to my face. I went into an absolute invincible feeling, no fear, only oneness. I stared into the gunman's eyes and he knew the presence of the eternal and broke down into tears, walked out into the hallway on some sort of suicide mission and was blown away by gunfire from the police. I woke up, went to class, went to lunch, heard people talking about a shooting. Watched CNN in the cafeteria and saw that there was a major shooting at a school, it was Virginia Tech. 

I have dreamed of every girl I've ever had a relationship with, sexually or more in-depth within weeks of meeting them. Often I don't realize it's them until some physical act occurs then I'm transported back to my dreamstate in heavy dejavu. I never let them know this though, well one but she was a long term girlfriend. I dreamed of the exact person one of my girlfriend's left me for a year before it happened, before either of us knew the person. He was far far off from who I would have ever imagined her, a sweet young skinny beautiful wealthy girl going for, a fat alcoholic old balding punk rocker (she's not with him anymore if anyone cares).

One time while driving to a nearby city at 1am I approached a major patch of fog. I was getting very sleepy and desperate to get home and decided to go through the fog without slowing. There were no cars and it was a country highway. I had been in the left lane the entire 1.5 hour drive, passing the occasional trucker (I know you're suppose to stay in the right) and as I approached the fog I had a sudden urge to get in the right lane. As I merged, through the fog, the merge itself caused me to almost gracefully weave around one of the biggest bucks I have ever seen, much taller than my car. I slowed down my car and looked in my mirror, watching it watch back at me. It was very surreal. I would have nailed him if I hadn't gotten in the right lane in that very moment. 

I dreamed one of my good friends from highschool died while hanging out with another friend of mine Charles, but I couldn't figure out who, all I knew was the city and that it involved drugs. I got a call the next day from a friend explaining that my friend Matt had died. I hadn't seen him since highschool. I asked her where he was living and it was the same city from the dream. I called Charles who lived in that city, which I had no idea they knew each other or that Matt even lived there, and he explained that he had seen Matt before with a bunch of really fucked up girls at a party and they were looking for heroin. Matt had never done it, let alone any drugs really he was top of our class and a football star who was working to get his PhD, but was so blacked out drunk that he was just laughing saying ""yeah let's do drugs!"". They apparently shot him up while he was passed out and he died. Had I not made the phone call due to the dream, no one would have known that. I was able to tell his closest friends how he actually died, they told me not to tell his parents because they would have been very ashamed and they probably already knew since they saying his death was caused by asthma.

I've had dreams where I've fought demons. They've come to me and tried to trick me by telling me they had secrets for me, then I realize what they are and we have a sort of Jedi-mind trick battle. I've never lost though. They always run away. One was so real that I woke up with a demon actually on my chest holding my throat. I guess it's a succubus? I'm not very familiar with the terms. It had wings that went up through my ceiling infinitely into absolute abyss / the void. I was so scared as I woke but went into a state of complete control and banished it somehow through confidence and went back to sleep. It was very real but also very similar to a state of sleep paralysis, the difference is that I was actually lifting my arms up and pushing the beast and could actually see things in my room. I've had sleep paralysis before and though this was similar it was the most physically awake I've been while having it.

Yesterday, I was listening to The Smashing Pumpkins for the first time in ages. I was listening to 1979 and wondering ""if they were to start writing again, I really wonder what kind of mood they would tap into, they did this so well, they captured it so perfectly but was it just a thing of the 90s? Is this a sound that still resonates with people, how could they twist it into something for 2013?"" Then I get on facebook today and my top story is [this](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/billy-corgan-starts-writing-next-smashing-pumpkins-album-20130326) with the first line ""Yesterday was the ""first official day of writing"" for the band's new album"".

Today I was talking to my Dad trying to convince him that he should go to a music festival in Gulf Shores Alabama called ""The Hangout"". I showed him that the headliner this year was Stevie Wonder, which he got really psyched about, he loves Stevie Wonder. He then said ""wasn't it the Red Hot Chili Peppers last year?"" and I was like yeah, and he was like ""man that would have been awesome too!"" then less than 20 seconds later ""Higher Ground"" plays on the radio by Red Hot Chili Peppers, a Stevie Wonder cover.

Basically, I have hundreds of these but I'm sure you get the point. I have a lot of them written down and a majority of them aren't as easily explainable as these are. They have more to do with personal experiences, dreaming of people I haven't seen in years, seeing them the next day. Simple stuff like remembering a certain dish that I love and having someone call me the next day asking me if I was go grab it with them. A lot of it is pretty mindless, inconsequential stuff but even then, it just reminds me that there is definitely something greater, at least on my end. I think I have a window into some other side where time isn't relative. Is there something I should maybe be doing with this? I do dream journals occasionally and I meditate sometimes and sometimes I do yoga but it's definitely a small part of my life at this point. I don't summon anything / don't practice much except a little bit of mental alchemy, however you define it. Any advice as to what you would do if you were in my position?

The essay, titled [Scientific Evidence of Magick](http://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/magick/texts/evidence.txt), gives a potential explanation for magical phenomena using the theories of 17th-century philosopher and scientist Pierre Gassendi.  

If you don't feel like reading the whole thing, the author (who claims to be a student of physics) extrapolates on Gassendi's theories by claiming that the entire universe is not just filled with the ""classical ether"" which scientists used to believe was the medium through which light traveled in the vacuum of space, but *made* of it, and that all matter is just concentrated whorls and eddies in an ocean of ether.  Thus, the mind operating on certain etheric wavelengths should have the ability to affect the movement of ether around it... or something to that effect.

I find the writing interesting, but don't think I'm anywhere near experienced enough to judge it as a valid or invalid theory.  I wanted to share it here because I'm interested to hear  other peoples' thoughts on the essay.  Has anyone run across this theory before?

[This is the Caduceus](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Caduceus.svg/170px-Caduceus.svg.png) and [this is the rod of Asclepius](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Rod_of_asclepius_left.svg/80px-Rod_of_asclepius_left.svg.png). As most of you know, the Caduceus is a representation of commerce, among other things. And as you likely also know, the rod of Asclepius is a representation of medicine and the medical profession.

It is somewhat common knowledge that the US medical profession erroneously chose the Caduceus as a representation of their profession, instead of the rod of Asclepius. The rod of Asclepius is used properly by other medical organizations and professionals throughout Europe.

The interesting thing, is that the US medical profession is actually accused of operating more like a business, and less like a sector that focuses on health and healing. Unlike other cultures in history, profit motivates the medical profession in the US, roughly 1/4 of all personal bankruptcies are due to medical bills. If a person does not possess health insurance, treatment costs are exorbitant - a stay of a few days can run over a hundred thousand dollars depending on the treatment, and, although it is technically illegal to refuse care to someone if they are in a life or death emergency and don't have insurance, many illnesses that take a long time for treatment in order to prevent death (such as cancer), don't qualify as an emergency, because until it's too late, the patient is not about to die.

The medical profession in the US *is* a representation of commerce and capitalism, it wasn't a mistake that it is represented by the Caduceus. The question is whether or not all of this is a coincidence, or a wry joke of the Gods to let us know where our priorities lie.

The precious blue sphere we call home is stretched to its limit. Along with this, or as a direct result of it, I see a quickening pace among people to figure out new methods of sustainability. Those concerned with parasitic economic paradigms work for change and put forth propositions for better solutions. Those concerned with the limitations of fast-food spirituality condone and present new ways of thinking and personal growth. Those concerned with the destructive results of modern technological society push forth and invent new tools that work in better concert with the natural environment.

To those here with interest in occult knowledge and magickal workings, I put forth a proposition of my own, as well as a declaration. 

The need for a new human condition is here, and it is great. To continue along with our current systems can only result in furthering the poisoning our cradle which will lead to an eventual death.

I believe an ultimate solution is in front of us, albeit in pieces. A marriage between magick, physical science, psychology and philosophy will open the doors to our deserved and natural state of harmony. I spend much of my free time diving into topics related to these, as well as politics, various religious thought, mythology, metaphysics and occult knowledge. The social contacts I keep are largely related to one or more of these facets I value. I feel that there is an undeniable connection between them all.

I believe a figure such as Aleister Crowley is needed again; someone who is willing to both go deep and disseminate his gathered findings to the public. I choose to be this person; taking what valuable insights and methods he and his contemporaries had developed while simultaneously taking care not to fall into the same errors previous explorers conducted themselves in. I choose to explore these topics to the best of my courage and abilities, while tempering any temptations of ego and personal gain with a universal love and commitment to the people as a whole, and to remain guarded from outside exploitations.

Membership in secret clubs is of no interest to me, though their methods and knowledge are. Coded grimoires and theatrical ritual items are not things I will keep, though the wisdom gleaned from their use is something I will have. I choose to climb the branches of knowledge and find the gates to the Fountain of Oneness, to open the doors and pass around the cup, so any who desire may drink deeply from it.

A great alchemical working is taking place in the human condition today, brought forth by people and faceless forces who desire for a future.

Despite what the circlejerking ninnies over at [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) say, we are becoming more and more a secular society. I can't count the number of times I've been invested in some bit of occult research or practice and found myself feeling extremely archaic and out-of-touch with modernity.

I guess the question I have is this: Where do we go from here? What do we have to offer to the 21st century? Does anyone else sometimes feel like a navel-gazer playing dress-up?

I tried to justify it with my Christian beliefs, but in the end, I couldn't, and I withdrew before I was able to truly get involved.

I stumbled across this subreddit by chance, and I wanted to know if there are any other Christians here and how they justify what they do with their faith, with the Bible, and so on. I absolutely believe there is real power behind the occult, however I'm not really sure how to explain it from the context of my beliefs, and I'd really like to see if there are any Christians here so that I can have things explained from a perspective that's more like mine than say, an atheist. It's a highly fascinating subject that I am hoping to learn more about. The sidebar links were extremely interesting and informative. and sparked in me a renewed interest to study further.

EDIT: I don't want to discount those Christian mystics and others who might identify as Christians here, and that's probably causing some confusion, because I'll still view those people as Christians.. I'd like to clarify that I'm just extremely curious to be able to hear from someone who justifies being involved in the occult from a Biblical perspective, but I do like hearing from the other people who identify as Christian.

EDIT 2: I hope I don't sound like I came here to ""save"" other Christians. That's not my intention at all.

AND BE GOOD AT IT!!!,DynamoJones23,39,16,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1dyewc/how_to_get_started_in_magick_and_the_occult_and/,"First you start by reading alot. I mean ALOT, you have to have an interest in this stuff and be discerning. I can't tell you how to be discerning because I can't stand people thinking one path is correct but, that also goes with; don't read one thing and think the writer is the Magus ov earth.

Then, you have to practice everyday. And, I mean Everyday. Don't have the time? Well, I know more then a few that complain about time but, spend hours watching Netflix or on Reddit. Manage your time with truth. 

That's it really. There are more then enough sites to get PDFs or post ov occult writings. Now everything below this line is shit I recommend so take it with a grain ov salt and move on. 

^the ^line__________________________________________________

Read Liber MMM, Grant Morrison's Pop! Magick, and then browse for other things you find interesting. There are a Shit load ov Styles, from Wicca to Thelema to Chaos to Voodoo to Buddhism to Neuromancy to The Keys of Solomon. The world is your Oyster in cliche. 

Next I recommend Meditation, any Meditations. Meditation clears the mind and EGO; the main points ov attack for Demons, both personal and dogmatic. Meditation helps focus and self-esteem and, other things I don't want to spend time writing about. Look it up.

Then I recommend Actually starting, don't be a Crisis Mage; those annoying fuckwits that do magick only when there is a Crisis in their lives and they need a quick cure all but, talk about magick as if they're John Constantine or Harry Dresden. You do more damage then good that way and I'm guilty ov doing it too. So, don't think I'm writing this out ov speculation.

Last thing is just a general rule ov society. DON""T THINK that everyone gets it. I know you might be excited about making it rain (literally and financially) but, not everyone gets it. Including other people into Magick; they might have rules that differ from yours.

It is not clear what the motive is for learning all of the details of the Tree of Life and there are many other beneficial things I could focus on if there is no clear use.

Further, apparently the Abyss between the top three sapphires and the bottom seven sapphires represents the distinction/separation between 'ego' and 'divine nature'. What do these terms refer to? It also seems that 'divine nature' is related to 'non-being'. Why and how?

How do these concepts relate to the idea of becoming fully embodied as a being of Magick and making everything an act of Will?

Part 5- The Book of The Void:

The Ni To Ichi Way of strategy is recorded in this the Book of the Void.

What is called the spirit of the void is where there is nothing. It is not included in man's knowledge. Of course the void is nothingness. By knowing things that exist, you can know that which does not exist. That is the void.

People in this world look at things mistakenly, and think that what they do not understand must be the void. This is not the true void. It is bewilderment.

In the Way of strategy, also, those who study as warriors think that whatever they cannot understand in their craft is the void. This is not the true void.

To attain the Way of strategy as a warrior you must study fully other martial arts and not deviate even a little from the Way of the warrior. With your spirit settled, accumulate practice day by day, and hour by hour. Polish the twofold spirit heart and mind, and sharpen the twofold gaze perception and sight. When your spirit is not in the least clouded, when the clouds of bewilderment clear away, there is the true void.

Until you realize the true Way, whether in Buddhism or in common sense, you may think that things are correct and in order. However, if we look at things objectively, from the viewpoint of laws of the world, we see various doctrines departing from the true Way. Know well this spirit, and with forthrightness as the foundation and the true spirit as the Way. Enact strategy broadly, correctly and openly.

Then you will come to think of things in a wide sense and, taking the void as the Way, you will see the Way as void.

In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existence, principle has existence, the Way has existence, spirit is nothingness.

I know there's an OTO higher grade ritual that involves anal sex but it's shrouded in symbolism and I'm not aware of any commentary on it.

This is an area of high interest to me since I'm classified as an ""anal retentive"" person. It's funny, the figures of speech we use when we talk have an ounce of truth. According to Freud, I didn't get enough time or was interrupted when I was exploring my erogenous zones. All that aside, I do feel how my muscles contract whenever something beyond my control happens, usually negative (tightening means attempt at control). Obviously, the more ""stuck up"" you are, the less fun you're having, and it can be detrimental to many things, from feeling comfortable to operating properly.

The most practical approach I have found is that whenever I'm feeling tense, I consciously attempt to relax the muscles for a minute or two and that helps a lot... but those muscles have a mind of their own (apparently there's one voluntary and one ""involuntary"" muscle) and that's why I'm searching for more literature on the subject.

I'm not sure, but the relationship seems to be the same with the penis, shriveling up whenever you're faced with tension (going in for an interview, for example). And no matter how good you are at concealing or controlling that tension, the body still reacts first. I'm of the belief that it can be tamed to do otherwise, but some methodology must be established first. Anyone have similar experiences/thoughts?

From there, tracking the progression of my skills and inclinations; celebrating milestones, rites of passage, events, etc.

I got to thinking... What if such an idea were to be implemented into a social networking website? People could form communities from like interests, find compatible partners for collaboration, sell crafted goods through an alternative currency, knit local communities, provide educational opportunities, and the list goes on. I envision ""quests"" hosted by ""party leaders"" for getting productive things done, like planting fruit trees in parks, construction projects, art projects, etc. Participants could be rewarded with experience points and achievements which would be tracked on one's profile.

I have learned a lot since I started reading /r/occult and I would like to contribute back to the community. I have noticed a lacking in the Eastern Mysticism department (a search on 'Kundalini' yielded *five* results =| ) and would like to offer a reflection of my studies here.

I have been studying the subject for some time now and feel that I know enough to give at least an introduction on the topic. If there is enough interest I would like to compile a summary of my main source, a book called ""The Serpent Power"" by Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe). This is one of the key texts that brought ideas like the Chakras, Yoga, Kundalini, and Mantra over to the West. It is a beast of a book but it always had this special little extra glint of light on it, sitting in my book case begging me to read it. Read it I have and it has changed me and my understanding of the world in many ways. Not many books have that power.

Topics that I could potentially cover:

**Disembodied Consciousness**

Brahman (undifferentiated consciousness)

Shiva-Shakti (consciousness as the static background to active power, still undifferentiated)

Maya (veiling consciousness that produces the illusion of separateness)

Nada (the first movement of the sound ""AUM"" creating the universe)

Shabda (sound in any one of its 4 aspects)

Mantra (an aspect of sound)

The Universe as being composed of Mantra, ie ""The Garland of Letters"" (the necklace of severed heads on Goddess Kali's neck) 

ParaBindu (the ultimate point)

Devatas (loosely ""Angels"" but not really)

Atman (the big soul)

Jiva (the little soul)

Yoga (union of the two)


**Embodied Consciousness**

Prakriti and the 3 Gunas (these terms are essentially equivalent. They are qualities of consciousness in its dynamic aspect. They are Rajas, Sattva, and Tamas, very similar to the alchemists' Sulfur, Mercury, and Salt. Everything in the Universe is created from these three qualities in differing proportions)

The Tattvas (various levels of consciousness, Prakriti -&gt; Buddhi -&gt; Ahamkara -&gt; Tanmatra -&gt; Akasha, these represent various faculties of Mind, and therefore Matter, that arise from Prakriti, for example Ahamkara is related to the ego and is called the ""I-maker"" because it poses the sensory input fed to it from the Tanmatras, or the archetypal senses, etc)

The 5 Bhutas (Ether, Air, Fire, Water, Earth)

Kundalini (the serpent power in its various aspects of creation)

Relation to quantum physics

**Cakra, Padma: The Centres or Lotuses**

What are the 7 Chakras

Properties of each Chakra: its bija-mantra, meaning and number of petals, its resident dieties, its representative animal, its Tattva, its Mandala, its location

A description of the human nervous system in relation to the 7 Chakras

The 3 main Nadis or conduits of pranic energy: Pingala, Ida, and Susumna and their relationships to the spine in general and the spinal cord specifically.

Raising Kundalini from Muladhara to Sahasrara.

**Practice**

Yoga: All of the above is great theoretical information but practice is necessary to produce results. This entire section covers many of the different forms of Yoga, Pranayama, visualizations and other techniques used.



As you can see from the summary of the summary, there is a lot of information in this system. The thing is that all of these topics are inter-related so it is difficult to just start in the middle and state random facts. I will try my best to cover all of the topics but I need guidance and feedback from you guys as far as what everyone is most interested in, if anything at all.

Story time!

I've always appreciated native american culture and the lore surrounding it but I'd never really considered the idea of a spirit animal to be a very real thing, I do, however, get a very surreal feeling every time I see a hawk. Since November 2012 I've been going through some intense changes and struggles dealing with loss from death and from losing a three year relationship among other things. One day in December I decided it was time to really make a change in my life and better myself. I quit drugs, alcohol, caffeine, video games and started to go to the gym and meditate more. One day, while leaving the gym, I was feeling really good about myself for one of the first times since the difficult things started happening and I heard a rustling in a bush that I had just walked by. I turned around to watch an absolutely beautiful hawk fly out of the bush and soar off into the sky. I felt extreme frisson and almost a dream like state.

I remembered all of these strange times in my life where I've been going through changes and have seen a hawk. Once in college, I was going through some severe depression and was walking back to my dorm among a crowd of people when all a sudden a hawk flew down and landed right in front of me and stared at me. A few people were skiddish about it but a few people stopped and watched. Just me and this hawk, feet from each other, looking at each other with a crowd of people stopping around us. Then it took off and I heard several people say ""wow that was weird"" ""is that your pet?"" ""looks like you made a friend"". Another time I was going through some intense changes in my life, feeling like I had really lost touch with myself. I was in the car with my family on Christmas day going to see my Aunt and a hawk slammed into our windshield and skidded off into oncoming traffic, dying instantly as a van ran over it. My family was startled but kind of joked about it saying ""well that sure was a Christmas miracle"" or calling it ""the Christmas hawk of death"". I felt really intense about it, like I had to remember that event because it was meaningful and as if I needed to say some sort of blessing for the hawk and I felt like it really was a reminder that I needed to do better.

So back to recently, as those things happened to me years ago. Since I have been going to the gym, eating healthy, meditating, cutting out bad habits, almost every other day I see a hawk flying directly above me, often during times that I'm trying to decide what I need to do next. Accompanying this sort of new mystic feeling and symbolism is that I keep having psychic dreams. I dream of seeing people I've never met, then meeting them days later, going places and experiencing things that are quite unique and then days later having those experiences. I experience dejavu so often that it's almost expected. A few weeks ago I decided one day to go to a thrift store and find some new pants. I was looking through some of the random decorative knickknacks and found this. I brought it to the counter and the man ringing me up looked me up and down and smiled really big saying ""I've really been wanting someone like you to buy this, it's really great and I think you'll give it a good home, I think it's made from rooster and hawk feathers"". I looked up hawk feathers but I wasn't sure by googling it whether that's actually what it's made from. On the back is a label explaining that it's handmade by a native american in Texas.

I know these experiences are there as a reminder for me to do better, to not be so impulsive and to harness my creativity in a way that can really help the world. I've always made art and music but I often fall off my path and into apathy. I believe these are signs that I have to keep going and keep improving, never surrendering to fear or apathy. After seeing these hawks for the last 4 months, I decided to actually google ""hawk spirit animal"" and the results were so on point, so exactly what I thought it was. Reading through the description of what a ""hawk person's"" downfalls can be, strengths are, potentials are... I've never felt such a syncronistic, frisson inducing, absolutely true experience. I know that a lot of these kinds of things can be a bit like a fortune cookie, anyone can relate with them in some way, but this is so beyond that. I already knew the meaning of the hawk, I know what I need to do, googling it and reading all of the different interpretations of this spirit just made me realize that this was a ""thing"" that other people may experience as well. I thought it might have simply been something just happening to me, for my own eyes having never really put any thought into spirit animals as a reality. I can't really do any of this justice, this is just an attempt to make this easily digestible for an audience. There are so many strange beyond coincidental things that keep happening to me, it's just beautiful and there's no point in trying to communicate it with words or through facts / logic, I'm going to try to put it all into my music and art instead where I feel much less limited.

Also, for anyone interested here's some of my art I've been producing since this all began in November. I'm a graphic designer but I spend my free time doing digital painting and it's been really helpful to me getting back into my groove.

**TL;DR** Have been seeing hawks every other day ever since I've been going through extreme changes, already intuitively knew what they symbolized, googled it and it was incredibly spot on, describing me and my situation to a tee.

Over the last few months I've tackled Bertiaux's Voudon Gnostic Workbook, Miketh's Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Over, Smith's Kabbalistic Mirror of Genesis, the Kybalion, Crowley's Book of Lies, Hine's Pseudonomicon, everything by A.O. Spare, Miller's Sorcerer's Secrets, RAW's Prometheus Rising and Cosmic Trigger, Duquette's Enochian Vision Magick... and I feel like the reading and pursuit of more books is getting in the way of my practice. (Occult.bz membership has its downsides)

The more I explore, the more I feel I have to learn. It's undercutting my confidence and potentially my results, but it's my natural reaction to tackling a new territory. How do you strike the balance between practice and research?

I've had some very interesting experiences with sigils, preprogrammed drug trips, simple empowerment rituals, dreams, OOBE's, etc since starting on the path as well as participating with some stuff in my local community- spiritualist seance, OTO meetings, meditation groups, hearing occult author's speak- but my energy is definitely going more toward the pursuit of more knowledge and techniques than toward a disciplined daily practice. I'm mildly concerned I'm wrapping myself in the things that I like without really making particular progress- though that's getting into a weird grey area the more I analyze apophenia. 

Can anyone else relate to this problem? At the moment, I'm trying to force myself to stick to one book/ program before moving on to another one. I'm starting from the beginning with Newcomb's New Hermetics, but I also have Regardie's Golden Dawn begging to be broken into. (In my head, I'm saving it for when I've tackled more of the basics).

1349552570.0,21,self.occult,111yzc,"Let's talk about failures: mishaps, mistakes, things that blew up in your face",PulvisEtUmbraSumus,29,8,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/111yzc/lets_talk_about_failures_mishaps_mistakes_things/,"While obsessing over your failings is a good way to throw off your energies, I have found that I learn more from my mistakes than anything else. I have one story from when I was first starting out that acted as a big wake up call. (Stick with me for the set up, its a weird one.)

I'd just started exploring the occult again after a hiatus of several years. It was the fall of my senior year in college, and I was writing a massive paper on the work of H.P. Lovecraft, which somehow or another lead to me checking out every book my university library had on esoteric affairs: The Lesser Key of Solomon, Gems from the Equinox, The Book of Pleasure.... lots of ""forbidden knowledge"". I'd begun making sigils, basic sorts of things, messing around with visualization, when I got some news that kind of threw me out of whack.

I had a friend-enemy of some years we can just call ""Steve"". I'm sure we all know people like him: smarmy, cocky, confident, generally kind of an asshole. He was kind of like Austin Powers except that he was always shagging the girls you were interested in or (as did happen once in high school and again a year before this story) dating at the time.

While I'm over it now (it's been ages)- in large part because of the events I'm describing- I hated Steve. I hated him with a burning passion for fucking me over more times than I was comfortable thinking about. Hating him was a way of displacing my anger with myself. And now, he was coming to my college town for a conference and wanted to hang out casually. I had a full on Edmund Dantes- Cask of Amontillado vibe going. ""Yes, come and visit,"" I told him, ""It'll be fun.""

I started picturing ways to destroy him. I was into drugs at the time, and I knew some sketchy people. On the night we were supposed to meet, I arranged to bring along a former boxing champion turned general hustler so that (on a cue) he could reduce Steve to a blubbering bleeding mass in an alley somewhere while I looked on in amusement.... Or that's what I thought I wanted. Honestly, there was something in Steve's tone when he called that seemed, if not repentent, somehow innocent. Do you get mad at a scorpion for stinging you, or do you just accept its a scorpion and move on?

Anyway, on the day of Steve's arrival, I wanted to amp myself up. I reread the Art of War. I put on Immortal Technique's [""No Mercy""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVmxA08BFrU). I thought about all the things I hated about this guy, the way he'd screwed with my life... and then... oh jeez... Then I grabbed for my copy of the Necronomicon by Simon.

I don't know what the consensus about this book is around here. Personally, as an amateur Lovecraft scholar, I have my own theories about Lovecraft's occult influence (his grandfather was the grandmaster of a local Freemasons lodge, etc.) but don't put much faith in the idea that the Old Ones existed before the stories were written and Lovecraft channeled his work through them in dreams. I think that's one way of looking at it. Anyway.

I found the sigil for Cthulhu. I drew it on my wrist. I pledged myself to evil, hatred, and generally doing what the dead-but-dreaming lord wanted me to do. I smoked some weed. I charged the sigil on my wrist. I went out to meet my sketchball friend and then to plot Steve's destruction...

Ok, long story short at the end here: I didn't go through with it. It wasn't the worst night out I'd ever had, we bar hopped, got dinner, and in essence I felt myself wanting to let my anger go. I just don't talk to Steve anymore- why keep people in your life who don't have your best interest at heart right? The night ended with the two of us having a drunken cigarette on a bench before he headed to his hotel, and I went to go meet a friend- probably to buy some pills or something. **This is when things got weird:** 

I remember arriving at my friend's house. Then I blacked out. When I came to my friend was screaming at me, hitting me with one hand, and clutching at his bleeding neck with the other hand. My mouth was bloody, but I wasn't hurt. **I had torn a half dollar sized chunk out of his neck with my fucking teeth**- for no reason and without any provocation.

Ok. I was drunk, I'll accept that. I may even have taken some sort of stimulant at the end there (that segment of time is understandably blurry). But this is the only time something like this has EVER occurred. I'm not really a violent person despite my posturing.

I worked myself into a rage, a frenzy, with the intent to do violence, pledged myself to doing ill, and when I tried to back out of the ""contract"", I went through with it anyway. Or something in my body went through with it for me... It's all very confusing.

What's weirder about this- if anyone has read H.P. Lovecraft's work- is that this is almost the ending of the ""Rats in the Walls"". The narrator blacks out in the cavernous passage beneath his house after faced with the evidence his ancestors were cannibals. Then, ""they found me in the blackness after three hours; found me crouching in the blackness over the plump, half-eaten body of Capt. Norrys, with my own cat leaping and tearing at my throat.""

**Anyway** this was a really weird turn of events. You try explaining to someone you've just attacked that you're sorry, this was an unforeseen consequence of entering into covenants with possibly other dimensional, possibly fictional, dark archetypal possibly egregoric things-that-should-not-be. In the end we managed to patch things up, both our friendship and his neck, and this became a weird footnote to my college career. That moment though was when the occult became real for me. Scary real. I haven't messed with the Necronomicon since, and I don't do negative work anymore. You should be trying to have fun, not giving yourself over entirely to your pain-hatred-etc.

**TLDR- I pledged myself to Cthulhu because I was angry at one friend. Backed out. Blacked out. Came to having attacked an innocent person like a fucking animal.**

This experience taught me a lot about myself, occultism, and the various ways this kind of stuff works.

1325520011.0,19,self.occult,nzupx,Transpersonal communication,spellraiser,22,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/nzupx/transpersonal_communication/,"First, definitions of some of the core concepts to be utilized.

Transpersonal forces: Entities (however you define them) native to the transpersonal realm (i.e. the spirit world, or what-have-you). They can be seen as residing inside of a person, outside of a person, or both at the same time. Take your pick. That's just how they roll.

Information: Relatively objective pieces of data, for example, a linear sequence of words in a particular language.

Meaning: More subjective pieces of data, for example, feelings, intuitions and personal interpretations of information. In fact, most meaning boils down to subjective interpretations of information.

Insertion: Any change in a person's mental processes induced by transpersonal forces that adds information or meaning to these processes, thereby communicating information or meaning to that person.

Ego: What most people see as 'themselves', the localized center of awareness and consciousness that's usually seen as balled up inside a person's brain. In fact only a subset of any given person's mental life, which also includes the 'soul', transpersonal forces, and more. It is not really an oversimplification to say that all spiritual growth has transcendence of ego as its main purpose.

---

Transpersonal forces communicate information and meaning to humans much more commonly than a lot of people would be comfortable knowing. Ignorance is bliss, and all that. It's not nearly as scary as it sounds though; most people are already fully aware that there is a lot going on in their psyches that they are not consciously aware of, so going from this to realizing that 'they' themselves are not fully responsible for all this isn't really such a huge conceptual leap, especially for those to whom the idea of surrendering the ego is not a frightening prospect.

---

The most common way this is done is by inserting something into the local feedback loop (the person's sequence of thoughts, feelings, tendencies, etc.) to convey meaning. This is far less intrusive and takes less effort than inserting more external communications to convey information, hence its popularity even for people who are very much locked up in their egos.

A simple example of this process: You think some thought -&gt; inserted intuition produces an amplified 'yes' feeling to that thought -&gt; you feel that your thought is (i.e. has the meaning of) correct and valid. Thus, meaning (feeling) is provided to your self-provided information (thoughts). The thoughts are all your own; you are just gently prodded into feeling that they are worth pursuing.

Another example is synchronicities, which are intuitions that events in one's life have deep personal meaning. Here, the external world provides information, and intuition provides the meaning of that information.

This process is of course more transparent to a person in the dream state, where the boundaries between ego and the transpersonal realm are lifted greatly.

---

When it comes to direct insertion of information, this is obviously always more intrusive to the person than insertion of meaning, and is therefore less common, and usually reserved for those of little ego. Meaning is floating everywhere in a person's psyche, but most people are used to receiving infomation only from easily identifiable physical sources.

There are also varying degrees of intrusion involved in the different methods available for inserting information. For example, it is less intrusive to insert tendencies to act than surface thoughts. Hence the efficiency of such techniques as automatic writing. The tendencies to move the hand in certain ways are inserted, and through its movement information is conveyed. The end result is insertion of information via a less intrusive method than a direct projection of thoughts. Also, there are other reasons why automatic writing has advantages over thought projection (for example, it is more focused and less open to interference from the person's own thoughts), but less intrusion is definitely a big factor.

---

Here we come to a general, already hinted at rule. The efficiency of a method of insertion can be determined by its level of intrusion, which is again determined by the surrender of will that the method imposes upon the recipient. This principle mostly boils down to the ego's built-in need to assert itself and therefore resist anything that it perceives as a possible outside influence, especially from the transpersonal, which most people's egos are just not used to interacting with directly. This resistance drains the person of energy and can be dangerous to his or her mental health, and hence influence by transpersonal forces is always tailored to the person's convenience. This is of course simplifying things, as there are many other factors to be considered here - but then again, not much can be said about these kinds of things without simplification.

Back again to the automatic writing example. A typical recipient is much more used to impulsive tendencies for movement (e. g. as a spontaneous reaction to an external threat) than to hearing thoughts inside his or her head that are definitely not his or her own, so automatic writing can be trained with less effort and danger of mental instability than the hearing of voices.

And of course, everyone is much more used to having subconscious or semi-conscious thoughts and feelings that can influence them outside of their awareness than having thoughts and feelings that intrude upon their consciousness and try to influence them in a more direct way, hence the preference for subtle insertions of meaning over overt insertions of information. Again, these just blend in smoothly with all the other subconscious activity that goes on in people's mental lives.

---

Also, this scheme of things is just the way things are for most people in this particular phase of human history. Once upon a time, people were generally much more used to overt communication with transcendent forces, but these days this has to a great extent been relegated (at least when it comes to mainstream culture) to psychological pathology, or highly formal religious events such as the ones orchestrated by preachers in the style of Benny Hinn, who serve as mediators and moralizers on behalf of the transpersonal. We are definitely in a very ego-centered phase, and scientific materialism (where the existence of anything transpersonal is flatly denied) and religious fundamentalism (where the ego is seen as being in a mostly subservient relationship with the transpersonal realm, and real spiritual growth is often sadly lacking) are the two main ideologies by which the ego is inflated and maintained, and they even influence and prop each other up in many subtle ways.

---

Of course, this means that as a person loses ego and reaches out to the transpersonal, he or she will become more open to more overt means of receiving information and meaning, and more frequent reception. The person will develop a better and better intuition, experience more and more synchronicities, and even enter the highly overt levels of channeling and other forms of direct communications with transpersonal forces. Do bear in mind, though, that you are never yourself in control of this process. Receive everything you are given with gratitude, and know that while you have earned it by letting go of ego it is still a privilege, not a right. Also, everyone does of course have a very personal and individual relationship with the transpersonal, so don't assume that what works for one person will also work for you, or in the same way. And of course, since the main purpose of these communications has always been the spiritual development of the individual, insertions of overt information are much less common than insertions of subjective meaning.

---

This is why overt psychic phenonema are so resistant to objective proof; this resistance is built into them in order to keep the focus on the natural and gradual development of the individual in the physical world. Psychic powers should always be seen as first and foremost as a tool for aiding this development, not as a means of obtaining information. Most of the relevant objective information is already out there in the physical world anyway, and is always being added to by all sorts of covert and overt means. Thus, a transpersonal force would much more commonly prod you into obtaining a good, informative book than tell you what's in it directly. Anyway, it's much more healthy, both physically and mentally, to go out and do stuff once in a while than to hang around all day chatting with unseen friends, fun as that might be!

---

A somewhat lesser but still pertinent reason why these phenomena are resistant to objective proof is to keep them out of the hands, and the spotlight, of those who would seek to try to abuse them. For instance, there are documented cases of government agencies attempting to prod into them in order to see if they can be used as weapons of control and warfare, as such agencies are wont to do. The simplest way to prevent this sort of tomfoolery is to not give these less than well intentioned individuals and institutions anything concrete to work with. It all works out quite beautifully most of the time, so do not be frustrated by your lack of ability to 'prove' that psychic phenomena are real. This is as it is meant to be, for the protection of those who are gifted with these abilities. And back again to the spiritual aspect, learning to use these abilities without feeling the need to stroke the ego by parading them around is a good lesson in humility.

A few years ago I came to the idea that ""reality"" in fact, does not exist. For many of you, I feel you've realized or pondered this idea before. Everyone perceives the world in different ways. The ""reality"" of a blind man, the ""true"" way things exist for him, are different for that of every other person that has sight. Now, the mass naturally assumes that the other person is broken and therefore misses out on a part of what is ""real"". However, just because it doesn't conform doesn't mean that the view of the blind man is any less ""real"" to him than normal vision is to everyone else. For that man, a world of emptiness is his truth, his reality. Based on this thought, who's to say that reality can exist in a global sense? How do we know that even the people that have nothing wrong with them are seeing everything the same way? Who's to say the person you're living with, or your neighbor, or your friend live in the same reality? It's all subjective, and it relies on the power and manifestation of your brain. The world itself is nothing more than a thought form.

Insanity: A deranged state of mind usually occurring as a specific disorder.

Based on the conjecture that reality doesn't exist on a global level and is in fact personal, is it possible then for there to be a ""deranged state of mind""? This would generally serve to indicate that the ""deranged"" person is functioning on a different wavelength based on that singular ideal of reality. When that ideal disappears, you suddenly have no more anchor by which to quantify thought, instead you have simply the thoughts of the individual person. In essence: whatever you see is your own reality.

Now, taking the above into consideration, generally insanity would lead people to believe that you're in the state of a mental breakdown, a disassociation with reality based on experience or biology. However, with no reality to disassociate from, because it's entirely subjective, who's to say that you're not instead achieving the pinnacle of control over your world?

The final culmination of this idea is as follows: by achieving, and I say achieving as it's a positive thing in this context, insanity you're taking control of your brain and allowing that which you desire to manifest into YOUR reality. You are essentially taking control of your world and in the words of Koetting, ""Becoming a living God"". Once you can change the way all of your tactile senses register information to allow for these creations of your consciousness, your thought forms allow you to literally control EVERYTHING. Every way you feel, every way you see, every person you want around you, anything you want is suddenly yours to behold. In this case, because reality is subjective, is insanity losing control? Or is insanity reaching the highest point of control you could ever hope to achieve? Is it becoming the God of your own world, rather than living in one that the mass of society chooses to incorporate themselves with?

I'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas, conflicting opinions, and philosophies.

Astrology...,CoriOreo,25,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1glpsp/so_astrology/,"When I first started looking into the occult through Wicca circa age 13, I noticed that astrology was a relatively prominent part of the practice.  It didn't make any sense to me - all other aspects of the craft could be pretty easily boiled down to metaphor, but astrology seems like a startlingly literal, very new-agey form of divination that requires that the alignment of the COSMOS THEMSELVES should have some effect on your destiny.  Teenage me decided that I could just cut out the parts that involved it, because it was too ridiculous to take seriously.

Nowadays I have moved far past Wicca, but I have developed quite an interest in the Qabbalah.  And guess what the Qabbalah holds a lot of direct parallels to?  Astrology!  It's rearing its ugly, confusing head again, and I am interested to learn more about it as an occult tool, but I just don't know where to start.  The only resources I seem to be able to find online are along the lines of how to match your wardrobe to your star sign and other such pop-dopey stuff - no real information on why astrology can and should be taken seriously by magicians.

So what's the deal with astrology, r/occult?  Is it really about having a destiny and personality determined by the stars, which seems absurd, or is there some greater metaphorical and spiritual meaning behind the symbolism?  Please be gentle as you explain - I know my zodiac signs, but beyond that have virtually no knowledge of the system.

The place was off limits to the public, even relatives. 
The lab consisted of a large chunk of property that goes on for about thirteen miles.

Most of that area, however, is just trees.

The father was apparently doing work on the atomic bomb during his stay there, however it was noted that they had a definite interest in alchemy.
I gathered a few photos to share with you. Note that the site has been abandoned for nearly forty-odd years and recently turned in to a local park, however nothing has been moved or changed since the family left.

I've found this forum damn interesting. I know another thread talked about the same subject but I felt like addressing it.
I consider myself an unorthodox Mormon. I am not a church-attending one and don't feel very comfortable with a lot of the cultural aspects particularly.
I've always been intrigued by the faith's connection to mysticism and folk magic.  If one is going to read a book on the subject, D. Michael Quinn has an amazing one. He used to be the official church historian before he ousted for publishing material the leadership didn't want him to. 
Here are some tidbits that come mostly from Quinn:
There is evidence that Joseph Smith may have attempted to summon higher powers.  There is solid evidence he and his family were into astrology, going so far as to try and the birth of his children according the Zodiac.  He divined water.  
Dreams and visions were an incredibly important part of the faith. Many mormons still believe in them but generally won't discuss them.  The church always encourages meditation but calls it ""pondering.""  Mormons worship one God but revere 3 other deities. Their cosmology also hints that there may be other gods out there. 
Not Smith but another church leader spoke of what most people would call astral projection.  He said sleep is a time to speak with our kindred dead and angels. After Joseph Smith was killed there were disputes about who would lead the organization. At one meeting Brigham Young spoke and took on the voice and appearance of Joseph Smith.

I'm considering summoning a demon of the Goetia at some point in the near future. I know all the technical details of the ritual, I was wondering if anyone has any experience with the Goetic entities and had any advice to offer?

EDIT: Hey guys, I did the ritual. It was a very intense but overall positive experience. It took a while but I really did get the demon in my presence, it was difficult at first but eventually calmed down. I feel I gained an ally tonight. An interesting experience was that at the height of the summoning, at it's most intense, wind was blowing a gale outside and I heard the sound of footsteps upstairs (there was no-one else in the house.) Then when I had the demon in the Triangle, everything calmed. The footsteps stopped. The wind stopped. I felt very tranquil and everything was very quiet. I'm not going to go into too many specifics because what happened then was very personal, but it was definitely a success for me.

A a wiley by way of Siberia, by way of coastal USA, a thieve and renegade, a music maker of space-time paradigm, has decided to stop by, to contribute some knowledge and help put your old ways in the storage.


Small body big soul, that's what I know

Where do I get the energy, 

to expand, grow?


To become all 

I thought was impossible

At first, now seems 

Quite plausible

do I run, crawl?


justice for all


""it's impossible"" and ""No"" - says the little soul

Quite often cutting an opportunity off

If one might listen, one might learn

Be I blessed or cursed by what my soul's worth

For everything is quite fair in this world


Life is a divine flow 

and God knows

Feeling in my chest drives me forth

Where do I get that energy?

To expand, grow?

Raise my consciousness?

Let my essence forward

Access the hidden

To be aware at all?


The way is one cause

The truth is the way, you don't see who your foes are

We are beautiful when we don't notice faults of 
others

Communication is true, we've always been brothers

Spec in your eye is a log in my soul

Will not let my consciousness rise at all.

What I plant in my mind, that's what will grow.


Some have crossed, some are still on the other side

Those who have crossed suffer to enlight

For suffering is step one


I am what I see

I see what I am

What do I spend my energy on, day to day? 

moment to moment, a sign or an omen, do I become an example or a warning?

What do I notice

If I'm critical of empty talk and little knowledge,

is it not the same side of the coin?

Fighting fire with fire when I'm hurt myself

They trigger it in me and I'm outraged


In reality it's been in me all along

I just faked my way through to pretend that I'm normal


There's pure light

I felt this way before, euphoric

top of the world, soul roaming, astral body found it's true niche, 

overspilling with the way, joy and certainty

Things appearing before my eyes once I think of them

Coincidences and synchronicity

That are random, seemingly

Things happen willingly

Conscious or not

The higher to the eye of the pyramid

The better I connect with creativity

Relay natural flow, The feeling when aligned with face symmetry

Love by design, limitless



The enemy turned into teachers, apostles 

and hurt souls, who just need love in return,

tireless love to learn

At least to be hurt no more

(Though the least is what's common, with common results)

People faulting other's fault

Talking with ego out of control

But honestly I don't know

If I should be talking about this at all


Kindness is the greatest quality soul can learn, unfold

Uncover what you already know but might have forgot

Jesus would forgive all

Forgiveness is the energy source 

Different words all meaning one

Ego knows no boundaries, so PLEASE break my fall

It's bound to put water in your burning foundry

I see it every day, the way we stop half way between

Love and hate, never getting it quite in

I didn't judge what I've seen

And I've seen enough to know that very little I've known is real

Communication is insincere when we live in fear it seems

Or need of control, If not love, then what, a water-less sea?


We attract what we see

We get what we perceive

300 billion percent of what happens is how you feel


When someone is angry at you, do know

It's nothing you haven't done to someone before

Karmic cycle, once again circle complete

Time is not linear even for those karma free

Good deeds, bad deeds all get registered

You get lower the higher your pedestal  


If someone hurts you, do know

It's nothing you haven't done exactly to someone before

So forgive and let go, let the cycle unfold

Take it all with love cuz that's all there was

But if we choose to hurt another, do know

It's going to happen to you once more

We can talk a lot about whats' right or wrong


Opinions are subjective

Truth is one, one is all

If you walked in a room a saw yourself standing, how would you react, like a friend?

Or a stranger?

Polite and fake?

Afraid of non existant dangers?

Or truthful, honest and kind

Straight forward, with nothing to hide

and much truth to find

Fear has got you paralyzed

Conversations just die, so you continue with force

Thinking the more you say the less cons and more pros

I haven't seen more deluded folks at all


Now that lesson is learned, there's more to explore

Crystal clear soul will have God's love

After suffering,

First step is to forgive all, even those who will hurt you more

Second step is to see everyone as your little bro

You wouldn't hurt a puppy cuz it peed on a carpet

Rise up to break your fall

You painted your ceiling but you had no floor

And you still wonder why we lurk in the lows?


Addictions, excuses and masquerade 

A masked parade, hiding the word: AFRAID


How we treat ourselves is how others treat us

You've gone too far and you need a revision

You've foolish with Nature's Law, now that you've known

Suffering it's time to learn


How we treat others before is how others treat us now

How we treat others now is how we will be treated later

Not same situations but same feelings will arise

The more you fight it the more it's fatal

Some say karma is like stars

They are near, slow, go fast, vast and far

if I drop a coin, it is immediate cause and effect

As above so below, stones thrown will come back

A hurtful word is just a few steps away to the one who said it and started the whole mess

In the first place

A righteous man avoids a hurtful word, no matter how small

But not to let it eat your soul

Follow your intuition, it's your call

Would you want to be treated the same way at all

If so, then no problem, continue on!


The problem is you are not sensitive enough to the energy you give off

A well versed word can be masked a pillow but in fact stone cold

I love can be said in hate

And from this love you wanna run away


So before I hear you complain, I need to see some steps

Drop your head, there's nothing to comprehend

Every situation - give love, good or bad

Understand, everything in your life is on command

With your karmic intent

We swear we are in control but we are 95% reactive

Remember, friend

Every situation - **give love**, good or bad

Love in the face of hate, and for life karmically you are all set!

If it's hard to love, just say, in your head, forgive and send prayers, today! (only 9.95 s&amp;h)

Turn your mind off and not fill it with much thinking at all

Queen of karma will then bless you, because the energy didn't route to misuse

You see muse when the ceiling is lifted

And we still wonder why strange people are gifted?


Sometimes love means walking away

Suffering is understanding, Kindness and forgiveness is illuminating the way

Everything is relative, fools stay complacent

stuck in their ways, to the wise of no relation

Patience...

The word love has a lot of connotations

But so does every word, how can the truth be expressed then?

Truly wise don't need to say anything

Aside from a explaining a few paradigmes and reacting ever so kind

We can change the world by changing our consciousness

On a forever quest, as soul doesn't die, can't be created or destroyed and always just passed on
To the frequency we are on...
Hell and heaven represent the frequency spectrum
Where do we belong?


Don't know what else to say on the subject but I will try

I am glad you read through step one

Forgiveness and love to gain peace

And to keep your mind, pristine and free!


Next time we will talk about other steps

To attempt to reach enlightenment

To counter balance societal attempt

To keep everyone in line and in check


Do they not see that they feel bad?

There are a few more steps

To attempt to understand where the truth stands

And where to get the energy

counter balance ignorance with knowledge, poison with remedy

What do they know that I don't?

I'm not sure how to go about this. I have recently been undergoing physical training with a guy I met in the gym. He has been training me in powerlifting. Much of his training includes not only physical exercise, but also mental exercise and philosphical conversations. The guy is someone who, 5-7 years ago, I would have found strange, and probably would have steered clear of. Now, we are good friends, and many of the conversatons we have turn to the state of the world, and he is very much into the esoteric goals of Freemasonry. Not that I know anything about such subjects. Many of our conversations seem very unnatural to me, being that I was born and raised in the U.S., under the ubiquitous presence of American media, and its censored versions of information. 

Much of what he has alluded to in conversations is esoteric in nature, and interests me, but it seems as if when he speaks, he only scratches the surface of the topic at hand, and then changes the topic.

For example, in the gym, he always says one has to suffer, and must eventually ""make his suffering his pleasure"". 

I was, one day, having a conversation with someone on the internet, and for one reason or another, the subject of the baphomet came up, and so I googled the baphomet, found the Wikipedia page on it, and started reading. I discovered that Eliphas Levi was the one responsible for the image of the baphomet which is most popular today, and on the Wikipedia page, there is a quote from Levi which says ""One must make one's suffering one's pleasure"", (or something similar). This greatly piqued my curiosity about such subjects, because the guy I have been training with, or rather, have been being trained by, makes statements that are eerily similar, as I described. 

Anyway, I've been rambling like hell, and just wanted to say that I am interested in the occult, and though I am totally ignorant, would like to ask if there is some method through which someone like me who has been brought up to believe in, for the most part, only what I can perceive with my senses, could be given some sort of sign that occult practices have real implications and consequences in people's lives? Basically, I'm asking if there's some benign way to prove to myself that witchcraft/occultism is real without harming myself or anyone else.

I'd also appreciate any insight anyone could provide me with, regardless of its subject matter, and apologize ahead of time if I have said anything that might offend anyone on this board, as I am extremely ignorant in regards to the occult.

I greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this post and respond to it. Especially those who are knowledgable. Thank you.

Found this reddit just now. You really can find everything on this website. Hope to find some interesting discussion and sources from here in the future. 

Thought I would open discussion regarding one of the fundamental questions of occultism: Why do we do it? What bought you here? What are we really seeking from the study and practice of it? Are you more interested purely in inner peace, finding who you 'truly are', or are you in it to try out some cool shit ala sigils, evocation and the like?

To shine a light on this from my perspective, perhaps I can tell you briefly about my story. I was 18 when I had my first occult experience. I was lying in bed and had what is commonly referred to as a Kundalini experience or being 'born again'. Completely spontaneous, energy rushing through my body, feeling one with the Universe, the whole shebang. From that point forward my life changed, and to try and understand what happened to me I jumped into the occult literature. Have probably tried or am familiar with most of what's out there.

Now my problem is that it's always been a process of jumping into it, taking a break and then jumping back into it again. I am 27 now, I have a professional career, I ask myself questions like: What am I really learning from this? Can I really learn more about myself from learning about some hidden correspondence of a Tarot card than I can from engaging in the world around me? Social life, romance, exercising, advancing your career, aren't these all the real ways in which we find out what we are really made of and attain self-knowledge?

And yet.. I always come back to it. I probably always will if once we are called, we can never avoid it. I suppose I do believe deep down that inner knowledge is what is really important in this life, and to achieve this in a truly meaningful way, the occult is the best place to turn. I hope to come closer to the realisation and knowledge of that True Self within us that drives us. Even if I constantly question myself whether I really make progress or not.

Oh and if you are interested, I think the authors that I follow the most are Paul Foster Case (I'm a past member of Builders of the Adytum), Franz Bardon and Napoleon Hill. Curious to know about others here on this too.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,False,,,True,t3_ncw2n,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/ncw2n/why_do_we_do_it/,
1320899249.0,20,self.occult,m71a2,Confronting my inner skepticism,the_bewildered_beast,20,0,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/m71a2/confronting_my_inner_skepticism/,"Hi all - 
I'm a new entrant into the world of the occult. I've been into various mystical elements for many years, such as Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta Hinduism. I've always gravitated towards their conception of existence, and I've appreciated their idea of 'God' as a state of existence beyond comprehension - but accessible through meditative techniques.
That being said, I've always felt there was more to it, and that's why I really felt connected and drawn to elements of Western mysticism when I began to learn of them. For one, they coincide with my belief in paranormal powers which are backed up by scientific experiment, and in my opinion, Western mysticism is a little more life affirming than Eastern mysticism.
The universe that the occult posits has a lot going for it beyond just you and 'God' as well. I've recently come to believe in ghosts, largely in part through the massive body of eye witness testimonies, and I believe that NDEs represent a real, supernatural phenomenon, and they often talk of beings that exist that are purely supernatural in essence, yet are separate from God. That also makes sense to me, if God is to create countless conscious beings that inhabit the material realm, and you believe in a supernatural realm, why should there not be supernatural beings separate from God?

But here's where there begins to be a problem.
Some of the ways in which the occult suggests that you interact with these supernatural forces, whether external or internal in origin, seem silly to me. Recently I watched a program called 'Supernatural Investigator', and in the program, they followed people practicing Chaos Magick around. During the time that they merely conversed about it, I felt on board.  Then came the ceremony...and I thought they looked like a bunch of LARPers. A man in a cheaply done pair of wings painted himself red while a bunch of people in robes enthusiastically chanted ""BAPHOMET! BAPHOMET!"" while throwing their arms in his direction. If there actually exists any notion of the creature of Baphomet external to this particular individuals mind alone, no doubt he would have smited them for making a mockery of him. 
I've been on forums that non-chalantly talk about summoning a succubus for sexual purposes, and people calmly talk about 'well, I prefer a real person', as if this is actually happening, as if it's common knowledge that you repeat a few words while burning the right type of incense and wearing the right color robe and a sexy demon will appear that you can bang to your hearts content. 
To me, these people lack healthy doubt and the concept of failing. If Baphomet/succubus or their subconcious representation of Baphomet/succubus didn't appear, they'd just pretend that they did, and *consciously* fulfill the experiment. In order for development to occur, failure has to be a possibility. That is the notion of anything remotely resembling a scientific doctrine, and the occult often represents itself this way, even the quote on the sidebar of the subreddit reads:
""A place where more than likely most of those who gather believe faith is the death of intelligence."" What are these examples if not  overwhelming faith and wishful thinking?
Which leads me to my last gripe. Even the Golden Dawn ritual book, an order whose spiritual goals I admire, and are largely the reason I find myself drawn to the occult at all, has items that seem silly and totally arbitrary to me. Why should my dagger be yellow? Why does myrrh bring me contact with the divine? These things seem totally irrelevant to me in the development of spiritual enlightenment. Eastern mysticisism's tactics seem totally relevant to its stated goals - ceasing thought allows one to experience an inner peace that is the true nature of existence, and by quieting ones thoughts, you're able to tune out the chatter of your own subjectivity. Even yogic practices of ultimate physical concentration can bring about an inner peace.  These practices even yield scientifically quantifiable results to atheists who share none of the metaphysical beliefs of the practitioners. To me, that is a hallmark of a valid practice. 
I feel that there is very real substance to the occult, and a lot of the aspects such as astral projection, psychokinesis, precognition etc are things largely ignored by Eastern mysticism, that find a home in the occult. Yet I also feel that many occult practioners live in a land of pure make believe, where because I am imaging myself at this moment, descending into hell and slaying demons, have just had a valid experience, an experience as valid as one who has studied for years, endlessly practicing. I'm shaking the hand of YHVH at this moment and he's telling me I'm right and anyone who disagrees with me is wrong. It's clear that someone like Israel Regardie believed that imagination was a prerequisite for development, but that this imagination led to real experience, and again, this finds a scientific correlation in the aforementioned investigated qualities like remote viewing, where it has been shown that those who can utilize their imaginations are actually more accurate than the average 'viewer'. I can dig that totally. But I feel that some people think that any imaginative experience is valid, not that you have to devote yourself to developing your imagination and will, knowing that you're going to have to separate the wheat from the chaff. That it's a process. How many of these people in a circle summoning Baphomet *could* fail, and say the invocation didn't happen? A hallmark of development is failure. Any practice that you can develop, you can have instances of failure.
If you've made it this far, my apologies. As cynical and mocking as I might come across, I want someone who understands my perspective and is perhaps slightly sympathetic towards it to tell me how they either overcame it, or distanced themselves from those elements in occultism they find silly, or perhaps can tell me where I went wrong, or all three. If you disagree with me entirely, lovely, but please give some substantive reasons, anything at all that can help me think. I hope you understand that I am not writing this to offend, but I feel it's something I need to deal with if I want to continue on, and I very much do.

As a psychologist, the psychological perspective presented in the book makes a lot of sense to me. His theory makes a ton of sense and helps to explain many magical frameworks and practices, and provides a framework for designing rituals and trance procedures. In fact, I would be surprised if the author is not well-versed in some occult practices himself, although the text is fairly academic in tone.

As an occultist, the only major critique I can make is that the author makes the assumption that there is a ""primary"" ""unmodified"" reality, and that modifications of this reality are a deviation from this primary reality. (He thinks that primary reality contains toxic elements and modifications are necessary for mental health, so I'm not critiquing his value judgments, just the structure of his model of reality as having a basis in the actual.) It seems that many occultists hold the view that there IS no actual reality, only (at most) personal realities that intersect between people. His model gives us convenient language by which to describe the difference between an assumed ""unmodified"" reality and our experienced modified ones, but it may not be accurate, even from a psychological perspective (what would we compare observed realities to in order to see if they were modified?).

Every time I write a post I feel like I want to explain everything.  I understand quite a bit when it comes to certain topics, but when I write something, I see that only a small fraction of what I know has been conveyed.

Sometimes I start to expand my post to add more and more and then I realize I am writing a treatise instead of a post.  And not everyone is interested in a treatise.  Besides... a treatise might just raise more questions than it answers.  And then each question must be answered with another treatise?  So where does all this end?

I *hate* the idea that I am not sharing something or keeping some knowledge to myself.  But I often find myself trimming my already fairly long posts.  Sometimes way down.

No matter how well intentioned I am, I can't transplant my entire mind to another person.  It's impossible.  Leaving lots of things unsaid is kind of hard for me.  Anyone else deal with this contradiction?  On one hand you want to explain everything you know, but on the other hand, you cannot?

I guess providing some hints is the best we can do.

Another reason I write this is that people who read /r/occult should realize that all the helpful stuff they read here is only a collection of hints and lots, lots, lots remains unsaid, and it's not always due to stinginess or hoarding of knowledge.  So if you want to know more, you have to ask more.  Every time you ask, you get another hint.  If you ask 10 times you get 10 hints and that way no one feels bad for writing a big treatise that might not even be wanted.

Sup, mages?

So, this just got posted over in /r/science http://www.space.com/17217-big-bang-phase-change-theory.html

It reminds me of a lot of pre-christian creation myth where the chaos/formless ocean proceeds the physical world as we know it. An example is the slaying of Tiamat and her body being divided up to form a stable creation for the New Gods and mortals to inhabit. 

I find this interesting because this theory parallels many creation myths over the world sans poetic anthropocentric imagery. Personally I feel that if this new theory is true then there is a very high likelihood that this chaoskampf motif may be the result of self-similar patterns in the universe. Specifically that the development of consciousness from conception to maturity parallels the solidification and expansion of space-time, at least superficially, and this being the result for the almost human wide similarities in early creation myths. That the two match each other in many ways is inevitable because of some fundamentally repeating process at most levels of existence.


This leads me to asking how you thought all this shit got started and how and if it has any baring on our practices. Being  /r/occult there should be some interesting theories at least.

1369435130.0,16,self.occult,1ezz95,Walking on Sunshine,OverTheShore,21,5,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1ezz95/walking_on_sunshine/,"Liber LUX describes the 'Right Way of Walking' as ‘a meditation which helps the mind to stop thinking’, achieved by long periods of walking combined with a deliberate neglect of one's surroundings. The difficulties posed by this inhibition of the senses should be obvious to any city-dweller; perhaps we should rename it the 'The Right Way of Walking Into Traffic'?
 
Jokes aside, the method of this technique has inspired me to develop a contemporary practice marrying psychogeography with the humble MP3 player. Described below is the method, which elicits a kind of ‘thought reflection’, a slightly widened perspective that may help the practitioner to see things they wouldn't otherwise be able to.

First, think upon a question or concern you have. A short period of meditation to clear the mind may prove helpful if your question is vague or otherwise insignificant to your present circumstances. The more pressing the matter, the more useful the method will become.

Now, pick up your MP3. Adjust the volume so you can hear the music clearly in the foreground, and the sounds of your urban environment in the background. Pick a song to get you started. 'Walking on Sunshine' by Katrina &amp; The Waves is an effective serving suggestion. Hit shuffle. Press play. Begin.

Walk for around an hour, either to a specific location or area, otherwise in a certain direction. Try not to go back on yourself, but also avoid interruptions of any kind where you can. Don't stop being you; help the old lady across the street, and return the toy thrown from the pram. Your existential concerns are far less important than being a decent human being.

Assuming a continuous flow to your journey, allow the music to become a veil, separating you from the world at large but not distorting your ability to see it. Focus on each song as it plays, recognising it as an echo of your own thoughts. Take what you need from the experience and enjoy the strange synchronicities that arrive from the ether.

A few tips and suggestions...travelling as a passenger in a car, bus or train can provoke similar effects. Get a window seat. The method works best if you regularly listen to new music. Taste is a reflection of self, and as such the significance and symbolism of your music is best interpreted when up to date.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,False,,,True,t3_1ezz95,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1ezz95/walking_on_sunshine/,

I still remember the dream very well.

I'm hoping this dream has some significance as I've been thinking about it ever since it happened, it feels very special.

Also, I apologize for my not-so-good English.
Oh well, here goes:


&gt;I woke up in a temple of some kind and as I walked along the corridor I came into a room filled with candles, a huge decorated table with people sitting around it in a circle.
There was one empty chair and in front of it on the table sat someone in a lotus position, I sat on the empty chair and recognized the person who was sitting in front of to be a young version of Aleister Crowley.
I said something like ""It's very interesting/nice to meet you Crowley"", he replied, but I can't remember what he said.
I also don't remember the faces/appearances of any of the other people in that room.

&gt;We talked about something briefly and then I was presented with two chalices in front of me, one full of some kind of liquid and the other one filled with blood.
I asked ""Whose blood is this?"" and they answered ""You know who"".
Then I was instructed to take both chalices, cross my hands and drink simultaneously from both chalices at the same time.

&gt;I then began drinking but I messed up and a lot of the blood was spilled on myself and on the floor. 
Aleister said something, but again I can't remember what he said.
After this I suddenly woke up and I had a feeling that I've never had before, it said ""I need to get back into that dream"". So I did and swiftly I fell asleep and in no-time I was in the room.
I finished drinking from the chalices, immediately after that everyone proceeded to chant something and dancing a ritual dance of some kind around the table (spinning clockwise, I think).

&gt;After the dance was finished, I was taken to a different room which was decorated with symbols, there also was a bookshelf and a few chairs.
On the ground there was a silver (? not completely sure) mirror of some kind and I was given a crystal wand in my hand.
I was told to try and spin it clockwise above the mirror as it will prove to be impossible to do, so I did and immediately as I started spinning it the wand almost fell from my hand but I caught it before it hit the mirror and then once again I started slowly spinning it clockwise.
After a while of spinning it perfectly clockwise, there suddenly was a drop of blood on the mirror which started to grow in size until it the mirror AND the crystal wand shattered into pieces in my hand.
I also remember the crystal feeling extremely hot just prior to it shattering.

&gt;Now once again, I don't remember 100% of everything that happened but what I remember for sure that I was going to be reincarnated and I was also shown the specific time period where I would be reborn (sadly, I can't remember this exactly)

After all this I woke up, terrified.

Once the fear started to approach I felt the panic start to creep up on me.  I was laying there while a dark figure slowly walked towards me. Once the figure made it to the door to my room I wanted to do nothing but open my eyes. Instead I just let him creep closer and closer. Each step filled me with paralyzing fear. I knew the figure didn't exist but that this is what my mind was creating. It didn't help dull the terror though.

Once the ""thing"" got close enough to touch me, it was no longer my choice to move. I was quite literally frozen with fear. The entire experience was about two hours long and I have no idea how long of that was spent with this creature standing over me. What felt like an hour after, I started to calm realizing that the thing wasn't going to harm me. 

I stared at it and it stared back. I didn't really ask it but more of sent a feeling of curiosity towards it if that makes sense. In response the thing slowly moved its face towards mine until it was a hairs length away. it was at this point that I was pretty much shitting myself with newly developed fear. Then, it sort of... kissed me? I felt the pressure on my face and I winced as it sort of pressed its face into mine. And then I guess I fell asleep. I have no idea if I had simply fell asleep during everything and simply dreamt this or if this was my ""trip"".

To understand the effects that i felt when I woke up you have to understand me. I have suffered with depression my entire life. Just recently the love of my life (Or so I thought) abandoned me. My only two friends in the world left to travel 5000 miles away from me. One for Alaska and one for Afghanistan. I lost my job due to the fact that they could no longer afford me. Shit has been pretty low.

Every time I thought of doing something (Writing, looking for a job, learning something online, cleaning) I have been overcome with the sense of ""Why bother"". It has put me in a very deep and dark place in my life. But when I woke up... I felt new. I mowed my grass after a month of not caring, I wrote at least twenty pages of my book, I applied online to a couple places, and I got a text message from my ex lover. That text message I am still pondering over whether or not I should respond and what to decide if we start talking again. I even plan to go out meeting a couple people for a job today.

But all in all this was a great experience. I didn't so much explore the confines of my mind but I seemed to have unlocked something. I hope you guys have found this as interesting as I have. I am definitely glad I went through with this experience. Hope I didn't bore you guys to bad.

Lewis ever since I was a child. There wasn't much else to read since my parents were strict Christians and didn't want me delving into any sort of mystical literature.

Anyway, I've gone back to read through what they wrote in the manner of fiction and nonfiction, and have seen possible *heretical* (gasp), but subtle references to both Gnostic Christianity and paganism. 

For example, a quote by Lewis:
 
""Supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It's like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can't trust my own thinking, of course I can't trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.""

*—C.S. Lewis, The Case for Christianity*

Now I understand this method of thinking could be linked to modern day Evangelical preaching, but it really does seem to be his own ""evolution"" of his own being and consciousness. 
Sure, I might be just trying to see a truth that isn't there, but I feel that there's so much that Mr. Lewis didn't feel it was right to share with us; and it should come as no surprise considering how much hate Mr. Crowley received from the British press. Of course Lewis had an interest in the occult during his younger days, which should also be observed while reading his novels.


On the topic of what and how Tolkien wrote, I feel that it should be noted his (more than) obvious nods to paganism and wizardry. 
There are plenty of connections to be made with the Gnostic community as well, but I'd really rather not go too deep into it as it would take far too much time to analyze and coordinate it all into an organized, reasonable format. So I'm going to ask you all to provide some personal input on the subject if you have any. 

I know the two were very close friends, but had a falling out later in life (due to what I don't know); and Tolkien was the one who convinced Lewis to convert to Christianity. 



I saw this post in a topic about Tolkien's possible Gnostic ties, located on a fan-forum. I felt it might be appropriate for this discussion.

&gt;
I just joined the forum after coming quite accidently upon the topic, kind of a stumble in the dark so to speak. If Tolkien had been a member of some secret society, whether he was Catholic or not, by the very definition of secret, I highly doubt that he would have expressed this publicly. Now we cannot assume that simply because he was a Christian, he would have denounced all occult sciences. And in speaking of Williams, perhaps we have here the counter-point of Saruman and Gandalf: one absorbed in the intricasies of ritual and deeply entrenched in dubious and captivating Arts, and the other a patient elementalist, close to nature, and being wise enough to know that delving too deep can waken things undesirable from the depths of the Id. Perhaps the Good Professor and his 4 fellow "" Inklings"" , discussed magic and mystery at great lengths, and it would behoove anyone to think that there could not have been an influence one way or the other. These 5 'wizards' of the literary world were clearly Gnostic even perhaps without intending to be. And clearly, whether any human intends it or not, we are all Gnostic by our very nature; as Bilbo grows from his child-like innocence to progress thru the story, so do we all, and along the way gaining 'gnosis"" of our potential. 
Hehe...Hobbits really are amazing creatures....

1369563433.0,16,self.occult,1f2qvb,"What is your opinion of modern science and scientific method, and maybe more importantly, the direction science has taken?",Aleid,22,6,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1f2qvb/what_is_your_opinion_of_modern_science_and/,"I don't truly understand the formal definitions of 'modern science' and the 'scientific method', but i'll provide you with my current perceptions on the topic.

I believe the scientific method (as i understand it to be - its merely following rational, reductionist, logical pathways/systems that implies no fallacies) is valuable in that it can certainly help bring us closer to the truth on a matter, or rather a model which predicts the truth accurately (which leads me on a little tangent regarding fanatic science fan-boys who are ever-prevalent these days touting science as 'hard fact' without any understanding of the concept of a model which i believe is nicely explained in Alfred Korzybski statement of ""The MAP is NOT the TERRITORY"").

As to the weaknesses off this method, i believe many 'scientists' are strongly associated/imprinted with the 3rd consciousness circuit (back to Timothy Learys 8circuit model here) which governs the emergence of rational thinking, which is certainly a powerful circuit for expanding on and implementing known science in more complex/detailed forms via new symbolism, which achieves a higher predictability power due to the larger amounts of vectors - represented in various symbolic forms - to perform operations on)

However I believe many today deny themselves the experience of viewing their knowledge set through the lens of 5th circuit consciousness from which emerges holistic thinking which transcends many of the false dualities of the lower circuits and allows the mind the ability to dissect and tinker with formative ideas (which later become material ideas in the lower circuits represented via various forms of symbolism) in new ways that leads to true innovation in scientific thought.

Translation of these 5th circuit ideas into the 3rd circuit - which is concerned with practicality, rationality, and real world implication/use - have become more refined and detailed over the centuries due to new more powerful symbols (which funnily enough emerged through mutations of less powerful symbols run through this 5th/3rd circuit feedback loop) which has led to more complex models with higher and broader predictive power, which is ultimately useful to humanity as a whole (in regards to manipulating the physical world - on a tangent, which correlates with my thoughts that demiurgic powers are one of the ultimate innate desires of mankind).

So these 3rd circuit models are really maps for territories that exist in the 5th circuit (which you could say are maps for territories of higher circuits. each circuit as you go up the chain is kind of a mirror reflecting on one or more of the previous circuits allowing for a more objective look at the data relations between and within them via various feedback loops - which leads to the evolution of these higher circuits of consciousness). 

As mentioned earlier, the symbols became more and relations where found on more levels as they mutated through this feedback loop, which led to more 'demiurgic power' (predictability) from science.

An example of evolution of symbolism and the power over natural systems more complex symbolism allows is that of the evolution of alchemists into modern chemists. The symbols of the alchemists where parts of a 3rd circuit map they where trying to create of the formative territory - which both classic alchemy and modern sciences are derived from - of the 5th circuit that they could envision by using those parts of consciousness. 

The problem the early alchemists had - compared to the later chemists - was the lack of symbolism that could explain formative ideas in symbolism that was cross-cultural and more recently, able to be conveyed to the layman. They only used esoteric symbols - which are more generalized than todays smaller units of symbolism - based on natural analogies and/or stemming from symbolism that has already evolved from 3rd/5th feedback loops in the past and shared into cultural information pools.

This symbolism would soon grow from itself, larger symbols constantly broken up into relations between smaller symbols via these feedback loops which as stated earlier gives more power due to more vectors to produce operations on.

As insane as explanations of the workings and understandings of the symbolism of early esoteric/philosophical schools may seem to modern scientists, they're essentially talking about the same stuff.

The difficulty in communication between the two is because - as stated earlier - many modern scientists are heavily imprinted into the 3rd circuit, and they fail to see that the archaic symbols are representing the same domains in the formative realms of consciousness (5th circuit), except that the older symbols hold more information per unit, therein lies the difficulty of the translation.

The ancient/archaic philosophical/esoteric arts/sciences where often more heavily influenced by the 5th circuit and often thought in more formative terms which they translated into symbols representing the large datasets they could explain in one thought-form. 

Comparing this to the modern scientist who see's through the 3rd circuit: due to the enormous depth and complexity our modern symbolism has evolved into today (via the neural feedback loops) we have made it incredibly more difficult to view things through the 5th circuit lens as we are so caught up  wading through the ridiculous amount of seemingly never ending symbolism and interconnections of symbolism (a.k.a. Neuro-Linguistic-Prison) that people often spend their whole life living without ever thinking in a formative context of 5th circuit consciousness, which more objectively true answers will come from.

As a result in this shift of balance between the level of attainment of true clarity   - those trapped in the never ending symbolism of the 3rd circuit, and those thinking formatively through the 5th circuit - a certain vampirism has evolved within the circuit of symbolic thinking in today's world.

Instead of true innovation being sought through higher thinking, the various symbolic maps are used against eachother as that is all they know. 

Symbolic models fight through an order so obtuse, cannibalizing and vampirising from each-other, leading to a reckless abuse of the demiurgic power that comes with the power of analysis of complex symbolic relations, that capitalizes on itself to further its desires while destroying the true formative Self of humanity and reality and further reinforcing it's own 'illusory' self.

I believe this has led a lot of modern science to be influenced negatively too much by the one-sightedness greed of its limited spectrum of reality, and personally deeply praise those few true scientists who still play with their own consciousness and are actively willing to look into the higher esoteric mysteries of the past where the secret connections and interactions of the abstract universe have already been discovered and recorded into history and try to reconcile modern sciences with these ancient mysteries and at the same time deconstructing these ancient formative mysteries into the complex, and very powerful symbolism we have today to create a science that is truly in accord with universal/natural law rather than the law set by a clusterfuck of a system we have evolved into today due to the lack of forethought into consciousness and the true nature and origins of information.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,False,,,True,t3_1f2qvb,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1f2qvb/what_is_your_opinion_of_modern_science_and/,

A few times recently, during meditation or repetitive drumming I have reached a peak experience that seems to be accompanied with strange occurrences.

From a state of blissful focus I am very suddenly made aware of some kind of external presence. I get the feeling of someone walking behind me, even though the house is empty - a feeling of goosebumps and the trace of a **dark** silhouette in my peripheral vision. My gut reaction is fear, which sometimes just snaps me out of meditative trance and back to everyday reality. Other times I am more apt at embracing and feeding off the energy of the experience; something that I find difficult to explain. I also have a strange intuition, which again I can't explain, that there is an element of *danger* to what I am experiencing.

It is really strange for me to think about, since I have been generally predisposed to a highly abstract perspective of things and have spent little time pursuing knowledge about external entities and other physical manifestations in my occult research and practices.

I'm not a fan of the commercialized, easy to swallow LeVay brand, nor do I like the structured, business-oriented brand of the Temple of Set. But everything of the Order of Nine Angles is fascinating. I've always had a fascination with Nietzsche, and their philosophy is a twisted, darker logical conclusion to his writings.

Thus far my main studies have been with chaos magick, and most of my ""rituals,"" (if you could call them that) are improvised chants and ""songs"", without any real language but basic, train of thought sounds, that to the few friends I discuss with, sounds like its own coherent language. The other is sort of drawn ""amulets,"" that I make as a sort of permanent sigil without a spell, but a spirit, tulpa, whatever you wish to call it. I get a sort of feeling for what the thing is going to be, and I design a summoning circle/glyph/sigil for it, and after it's been designed and colored, I leave it by my bedside and wake with a face and name sitting in the forefront of consciousness.

I've been trying to learn divination via the tarot (I bought a Salvadore Dali deck a while back, and it resonated, but I eventually came to dislike the liberties taken with regards to symbolism), and just today I found a Golden Dawn tarot. I prefer the Ryder-Waite, Golden Dawn, and Thoth decks, mostly because in terms of magick and such, to actual physical constructs, I prefer the solidity of traditional, tested and true. I've also been trying runes, but I can't dispel this distaste with Blum's ""blank"" rune. It doesn't feel natural to me. I mostly use runes in regards to the sigils I spoke of earlier, combined with polygrams.

Thing is, I'm not sure where to start so before trying random stuff and seeing where it takes me I though I could ask some advice here.  
  
So what/who would you recommend?  
I'm planning on having an offering. Is burning something a good idea? I have some trouble with the remains. I live in a city, I can't throw them away of course, can't burry them and can't leave them around either. So I thought that I might as well burn something and scatter the ashes in th wind.  
Is time essential? I'd like to do it after 00:00 for a bit of (morronic) symbolism.  
Should I do some banishing before or after? Usually I do it before.
Finally if you have any advice or want to share your own experiences that would be great !

Specifically, I am interested in qabalah as a model of states of consciousness and/or spiritual ""locations"".

Here are some of the issues I'm struggling with:

* Different versions of the tree of life and its arrangement
* Different systems of attributions between the tree of life and various contexts. Some people use it as a map of consciousness in general, some as a map of long-term spiritual attainment, some as a map of states of consciousness or spiritual ""locations"", and many other perspectives. They seem to contradict each other and none of them has been stated clearly enough to be of much use to me so far.

* Different attributions for the tarot cards and of their arrangement on the tree of life. The most common system is the 22 trumps for the 22 paths on the tree of life, and the 10 minor arcana of each suit for the sephiroth. Other systems include top-down and bottom-up sequential arrangements of the major arcana onto a combination of both sephiroth and paths. I've seen many other views also and some of them seem more useful than others.

* How are the cards actually used to traverse the tree?

I know the tree can be interpreted in many ways, but I've yet to come up with even one way that seems coherent and useful.

The best I've come up with so far is the following perspective: The tree of life can be used as a map of spiritual ""locations"" or states of consciousness. Everyone starts at the bottom and you gradually unlock other sephiroth by traversing the pathways (like a skill tree in a videogame). Once you have visited a sephiroth/state of mind and consciously identified it as a strange attractor, you can revisit it more easily. The pathways can be attributed to tarot cards and used as an aid in navigation if you know how to unlock the symbolism of a given card. Is this a workable perspective? Ideally, my goal is to use the cards like Myst books :-).

My boyfriend passed away recently and though I was doing alright for awhile, I decided to phone someone who runs a support group in my area.

The support group leader (I'll call her Mary) was very nice and understanding towards me. She lost her husband three years ago and for being a complete stranger, she really made me feel a lot better. I mentioned off-handedly (and somewhat jokingly) that I'm so sad, I'm considering visiting a medium, and she told me that she knew of one in my area who is ""the real deal."" 

Suddenly, because a complete stranger told me about it, I'm desperate to try it out. I have two ""safety questions"" to which only my boyfriend would know the answer, and I plan to walk right out immediately if the medium can't relay their simple answers to me. 

I guess what I'm wondering is if I'm cheapening my boyfriend's memory by trying to do this. If it isn't real, I'm out $100 and will in some ways have to start the grieving process all over again. If it is real, then...well, I have a list of other questions both personal and logistical.

What really separates the person who truly beleives in supernatural forces and uses rituals to their advantages, versus a skeptic who uses those same rituals as a kind of older analogue to jungian or freudian psychology?

I'm not trying to generalize or anything, but it is honestly seeing how magick is not thinking you can shoot fireballs from your hand, but rather how associating yourself with the idea of fire to make yourself more passionate etc, is what got me more open minded about the occult and allowed me to take it more seriously, as i used to think it was nonsense.

I thought to myself, if this is the real present, whats going on when we are sober.

My theory or idea is that the majority of us dont actually live in the present, or that we live in the delayed present, possibly a second or two behind. Really we project our minds into the past (nostalgia) and we project them into the future (anticipation of future event).

Imagine if you will, the present is a space ship in which we are all riding on through various dimensions. Now imagine that you are tethered to this space ship via a rope or cord. If you try to jump behind the space ship into the past, you will feel like your being dragged back into the present while clawing away at the past. this is the feeling of trying to re live old ways but constantly being reminded its never going to be like this again. this is past projection.

future projection is when your anticipating a future event, time seems rather slow. This would be like jumping in front of the space ship and waiting for it to catch up to you, it seems to take forever, because you are not moving.

This phenomenon of past and future projection can speed up or slow down time. If everyone has their minds projected in the future, the space ship,(or the present) will be pulled faster into the future in which you have projected yourself. If however people have their minds projected in the past, this can slow down the present and impede on the progress of mankind. an example of this is fundamentalist christians not wanting to progess further into science or social matters. These fundamentalists are slowing down time because they are clinging to the 1950's by projecting themselves onto the past, and people like us who project into the future are dragging everyone else along with us.

Then the imagination is a whole different story. if past and future projection is like left or right, imagination is more like astral projection, projecting our minds into alternate universes, or up and down. By thinking of alternative worlds, we steer the direction of the present into alternate universes.

really to me, its only our physical bodies that remain in the present and our consciousness is either behind or ahead of the present, or are on alternate space ships, but all together never fully on the present itself. By the time your mind processes what time it is, its already behind because you have to wait for signals to process.

what ive noticed with psychedelics is that they allow your mind to safely project onto the past or the future without feeling the pull of the present in the past, or having to wait for the present to catch up in the future. Sort of like when you are tripping hard and you hear a song that takes you back to a certain time in your life, without feeling empty knowing that you have to focus on the present. perhaps their is no present, or past or future, just different locales in hyper space.

I hope this is a suitable subreddit, I guess this question could apply to many different ideologies, cultures, religions, circles, or practices... but this week I've been lurking in Occult and I like what you all have going here! :)
  

I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/v5x41/i_am_in_desperate_need_of_a_solution/) a while back: about depression, dull monotony, and darkness I felt throughout my life.  
         

However, I failed to mention the mysterious flip side.This could be considered a follow up post to how my life has been turning inside out regarding my perspective and emotions. When I'm not down, THIS is how I feel: 
     

Here it goes! :)        
  

This is a personal post, but I'm curious as to how many of you may have experienced similar phenomena, regarding Synchronicity (Refer to Carl Jung) and what it symbolizes.      
    

I am usually very rigid and objective, and not until recently have I begun to open my mind to other ideas. My mind goes through stages such as this on occasions that are unfortunately few and far between (aforementioned depression), so I'm trying to take advantage of it while it lasts... before I return to the routine, the normal, and the sensible reality I'm stuck in. I've been riding this varied wave of spirituality, occult, philosophical, and religious ideologies/theories for about a year now.        
  

Most of my life has been a dull, BUT there are times where I have outrageously unlikely coincidences, mainly signaling a shift in consciousness and perspective... as if looking or experiencing the universe from a completely different angle, as if for a moment, hour, or day.. escaping the mundane, dark, and dull that I so often find myself in.        
  

 Every once in a while, though, I get this moment that may be sudden and short lived(hour/day), or gradual and long (week/month) that allows me to really LOOK. It allows me to see the world around me with open eyes and notice patterns, synchronization, and coincidences that seem to apply DIRECTLY to me. It's as if it's a dream and no one else can see it. This dream state allows me to suspend my usual disbelief and just ""go with the flow"" and watch the surprises unfold.        
  

The feeling is undeniably warm, yet spiked with excitement. It's like being a child again and the whole world is mystifying once more.. but in the end I can't make anything of it.    
  

I cherish these moments, but my problem is that I don't know what purpose they serve! If this Synchronicity is meaningful, It can be compared to looking at an envelope with a message inside, you know it's for you, but the message is in another language. At the end, I'm not even sure of they certainly are for me, or if my brain is just making connections?    

This explains what I am experiencing, but It leaves a lot to be desired as to why/how this is occurring: http://www.flowpower.com/understanding_synchronicity.htm What does it mean? I'd like to hear varying perspectives and remain open! Thank you all! :)
  

EDIT: I have adjusted most of the post for clarity and understanding, my mind is a little wild.

1340770376.0,16,self.occult,vo39b,What do you make of this Tarot synchronicity?,perspectival,19,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/vo39b/what_do_you_make_of_this_tarot_synchronicity/,"First minor synchronicity: The other day I made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/vgmqb/has_anyone_ever_had_a_lucid_dream_like_this_its/c54mlgw) with my other account, in a discussion about seeing past naive realism. The discussion led me to come to a synthetic summary of a lot of my recent thought. That same day, by chance I came across a link to a PDF of Robert Anton Wilson's Prometheus Rising in another reddit thread. I didn't have a good prior sense of what it was about but had heard some good things about it, so I gave it a look. Turns out there were a lot of strong parallels with the ideas I'd just written about. OK, it caught my attention as an interesting coincidence, but nothing major.

Now the bigger synchronicity: while reading Prometheus Rising, I came across the following image, which I'd never seen before.

http://i.imgur.com/a7T1w.png

I paused on seeing this for a few moments of dumbstruck awe. The female figure looked almost identical to one in a drawing I'd done nine years earlier:

http://i.imgur.com/knjEP.gif

Here are the two images side by side:

http://i.imgur.com/oa3eG.png

To put this all in context:

At the time of the drawing I was in a pretty good place spiritually. I'd had a run of some divinely blissful mushroom experiences, and that vibe was the inspiration behind the drawing. This was also around the time when I'd found the person who is basically my soulmate. These were all new vistas for me, so overall it was a kind of initiation into a deep and novel spiritual satisfaction.

After that I kind of drifted off the path into a more mundane existence... until a couple of years ago when I got into a pretty bad place and wound up shooting back onto the spiritual path big time, this time not by psychedelics but from realizations about perception and reality and what RAW might call the programmability of one's own reality tunnel. 

At the time of writing I'm at a crossroads where I know my life is going to change a lot in a year or two (completing a degree), but I have a lot of internal conflict and indecision over where to take things. In particular I'm trying to figure out how best to align and harmonize everyday life and career kinds of concerns with more spiritual concerns like achieving awakening and self-actualization. In the days leading up to the synchronicity I've been getting increasingly obsessive and consumed with trying to figure out how to make it all work, constantly reading a range of things and trying to stitch together some workable framework for my immediate future.

As for the synchronicity:

I'm not familiar with Tarot, so all I know about this Lust card from Crowley's deck is from what I've learned by google in the last couple of days. It is striking that not only is my drawing very similar visually to Lust, but they also share a primary symbolism pertaining to blissful intoxication in the divine. I also see that Lust has connotations of self-mastery, union of the lower instinctual self and higher spiritual self, etc. 

So the meaning of Lust seems to connect to both the spiritual peak I was experiencing at the time of the drawing, and the mini spiritual crisis I'm facing presently. It seems suggestive. 

Comparing the two pictures, I see two main differences. One is that my drawing includes the angelic symbols of wings and halo. (Holy Guardian Angel?) The other is that Lust is riding on the seven-headed beast and is holding the reins, while the angel in the drawing is ""in the clouds,"" without solid grounding. This again seems reflective of my current predicament, as achieving this grounding is what I'm trying to do.

The synchronicities are impressive (to me at least), but they only seem to reflect the status quo. I don't see any indication or suggestion for a direction to look into. Not a complaint, just an observation.

I'm really curious what this community thinks of all this. Am I missing anything in interpreting the Lust card? Am I overlooking some potentially meaningful connection?

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for your input, and if there's more please keep it coming. I am looking into all avenues of inquiry suggested here. Nothing has really ""clicked"" yet so I don't have much in the way of intelligent replies to your comments at the moment. Still collecting and fermenting.

**EDIT:** Still fermenting things. But a minor deluge of new synchronicities have popped up today, drawing my attention to things in the recent and more distant past, and suggesting new directions to go in. To cut to the chase, what I'm taking away from it all for now, based on the initial synchronicity, your comments, and the newer stuff, is the following. (1) Indulge more frequently and more deeply in the pleasures of everyday life and meditative concentration states (perhaps I have had an overly renunciative attitude lately). (2) Everyday living requires action and 'going somewhere'; one can take either a barren urban path or a pleasant nature path to get to the same destination, i.e. the beauty of nature is an aspect of the path, not a destination; in this way, the 'doing' of everyday life need not be inconsistent with the 'being' of the spiritual life. Don't let 'doing' conceal 'being', but also don't let 'being' distract from 'doing'. Nothing I haven't thought of before, but perhaps I haven't really gotten to the living core of this perspective yet, and need to give it a deeper consideration. (3) Face up to personal obstacles that keep recurring year after year, shadow stuff, and try to get to the roots of the problem, instead of treating the surface symptoms.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,1340925914.0,,,True,t3_vo39b,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/vo39b/what_do_you_make_of_this_tarot_synchronicity/,

They have different philosophies both about the theory and the practice of what constitutes the best way. It's possible that I'm still looking for the teacher that I vibe the best with, and perhaps some of the information I have can help others find their best teacher. 

With that in mind, I will write about a few of the people that I've read, and try, as briefly as possible, to summarize their style and beliefs. Hopefully some replies in this thread can talk about other teachers.

The first man that I started reading was Israel Regardie. He is a  very scholarly man, and takes a very scholarly approach to occultism, which in this case, is Hermeticism - he's a Golden Dawn man. His approach can be very mechanistic, at odds with those who are more Chaos influenced. But since he is so scholarly, I think his perspective on rituals almost becomes historical. That is to say, most teachers try to engage your subconscious in some fashion, Chaos magicians try to do that by self expression that bypasses conscious thought, while I feel Israel Regardie learns so much of various traditions, that their beliefs become very immediate to the practitioner, you immerse yourself in their 'culture' throught learning and development of the imagination, and those rigid formulas to magic begin to have meaning to them. That's all I'm going to write on him for now, as with any cases, if you disagree or have more to add, please do so.

Next up, is Franz Bardon. He offers very practice oriented work. He dives right in, and expects you to practice, practice, practice. I like his style very much, he builds up with exercises that develop your imagination and will in a variety of ways. For instance, he might have you hold an image in your mind for 5 minutes. Then, after you have completed that, create a 'video' in your mind that includes sound. Then, you should be able to imagine yourself as another object, see from its perspective, feel your body as its shape. He progresses on into exercises that frankly, I find unbelievable. But even though I doubt the authenticity of some of these claims, his work no doubt *does* include real work that aids in your development. He is very different from Regardie in so far as scholasticism does not seem as important, it is more about developing your faculties. He also seems fairly influenced from Eastern thought. It's as if he took Eastern methodology in Western context. 

I have been doing many of Bardon's exercises, but I have not had the chance to truly apply my practice towards anything 'verifiable'. I haven't been doing invocations or evocations yet, so I cannot say for certain if either of them has a more effective regimen for me.

Ok, that's all I have to say so far, let's hear about the people that influence you.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,False,,,True,t3_ob39i,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/ob39i/lets_talk_about_some_of_the_notable_people_in_the/,

1310174094.0,16,self.occult,ikjk8,Auras...what do they look like and how you can see them or see them better.,avengefulghost,21,5,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/ikjk8/auraswhat_do_they_look_like_and_how_you_can_see/,"Forget the traditional view of auras.  The base aura has never been larger than 2 inches in my experience, not a good 16 inches from the body and shining for all to see as depicted in many images.  Around a spiritual leader like Jesus or Buddha, I don't doubt at all that it could be 16 inches and shining, but for regular humans who can barely crawl out of bed in the morning, you would be lucky to see 1 inch.

For simplicity sake, I'll use the largest aura I've ever seen due to its particular complexity.  Every aura has an outline that surrounds the body.  The distance from the body to the outline is a measure of how much energy that person has.  Small separating distance means low energy, great separating distance means high, so with most levels being around half an inch to an inch, seeing two inches was surprising and hard to miss.  Most often the aura is composed of one dominant colour, which will change based on mood, and either a black or a white tinge to it.  Black is bad regardless of the dominant colour (and a side note, I've never seen grey..the black and white never seem to mix like the colours can) and white is good.  This particular aura was unlike the rest in that instead of there being one dominant colour and a tinge, there were two distinct bands of blue and green within the aura.  I later came to realize this meant she was pregnant.

I do not know what the colours mean, however the colours associated with chakras do seem to fit the impressions I get and then based on whether there is black or white in the colour, I can determine the person's mood whether they're trying to hide it or not.

Now for seeing them.  Forget trying to see the auras of people for now.  They are too small and people move too much to learn to differentiate between the 'after-image' effect and a true aura at the beginning.  For now I'll give one way for those who want to learn, and one to show non-believers what an aura kind of looks like.  The easiest to see and therefore believe is the ring of light around a full or near to full moon on a cloudy night.  Notice the distance from the moon to the ring?  The space in between is filled with a colour when you can see auras, where as the moon's colours don't start until the ring begins and it's just a rainbow, so it's just a rough approximation.  In any case it helps you to visualize the line that surrounds the body to be examined.  I suggest dawn or dusk and a treeline against a hopefully solid colour sky.  Take a moment to appreciate the beauty before you as this will most definitely help you to see them.  This is the true way to increase your energy...the appreciation of the plant.  I can only tell so much and there is so much to cover in order to truly allow the energy to enter you, but for now, simple appreciation at dawn or dusk should form a line about 5-6 inches above the tree line and it should almost perfectly follow the tree line.  This is the aura of the forest and your first step to tripping people out!  Learn to get used to hearing 'How do you do this?!' and responding graciously.

If you have difficulty, questions, etc. I am more than willing to respond though some times it may take me a bit.  And expect large messages once we start talking lol as I said...a LOT of stuff to cover.  I'll keep posting these threads as my discussions with others are often for the same thing or lead to the same thing.

Really fantastic book on shamanism, gnosticism, self-initiation. and English! Nice to know one of the greatest spiritual thinkers was an Englishman

**Fascinated by his own imagination, Coleridge secretly wrote that its characteristic blend of power and desire made him a ""Daemon"": a being superstitiously feared as ""a something transnatural."" Coleridge and the Daemonic Imagination examines this simultaneous experience of exaltation and transgression as a formative principle in Coleridge's poetry and the fabric of his philosophy. In a reading that spans the breadth of Coleridge's achievement, through politics, religion and his relationship with Wordsworth, this book builds to a new interpretation of the poems where Coleridge's daemonic imagination produces its myths: ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"" ""Kubla Khan"" and ""Christabel."" Gregory Leadbetter reveals a Coleridge at once more familiar and more strange, in a study that unfolds into an essay on poetry, spirituality, and the drama of human becoming.**


Part IV of the poem,

`I fear thee, ancient Mariner!

I fear thy skinny hand!

And thou art long, and lank, and brown,

As is the ribbed sea-sand.


I fear thee and thy glittering eye,

And thy skinny hand, so brown.' - 

""Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!

This body dropped not down.

Alone, alone, all, all alone,

Alone on a wide wide sea!

And never a saint took pity on

My soul in agony.

The many men, so beautiful!

And they all dead did lie;

And a thousand thousand slimy things

Lived on; and so did I.

I looked upon the rotting sea,

And drew my eyes away;

I looked upon the rotting deck,

And there the dead men lay.

I looked to heaven, and tried to pray;

But or ever a prayer had gusht,

A wicked whisper came and made

My heart as dry as dust.

I closed my lids, and kept them close,

And the balls like pulses beat;

Forthe sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky,

Lay like a load on my weary eye,

And the dead were at my feet.

The cold sweat melted from their limbs,

Nor rot nor reek did they:

The look with which they looked on me

Had never passed away.

An orphan's curse would drag to hell

A spirit from on high;

But oh! more horrible than that

Is the curse in a dead man's eye!

Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,

And yet I could not die.

The moving moon went up the sky,

And no where did abide:

Softly she was going up,

And a star or two beside - 

Her beams bemocked the sultry main,

Like April hoar-frost spread;

But where the ship's huge shadow lay,

The charmed water burnt alway

A still and awful red.

Beyond the shadow of the ship

I watched the water-snakes:

They moved in tracks of shining white,

And when they reared, the elfish light

Fell off in hoary flakes.

Within the shadow of the ship

I watched their rich attire:

Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,

They coiled and swam; and every track

Was a flash of golden fire.

O happy living things! no tongue

Their beauty might declare:

A spring of love gushed from my heart,

And I blessed them unaware:

Sure my kind saint took pity on me,

And I blessed them unaware.

The selfsame moment I could pray;

And from my neck so free

The Albatross fell off, and sank

Like lead into the sea.""

I'm getting some information that there are new spirits who have become Goetics.  In other words, the roster is changing, adding new members to this group.  But I wonder how reliable this is in consideration with the body of knowledge that is traditional Goetia.

So I wanted to ask r/occult, what are you're thoughts on this?  Can new spirits *become* Goetic?  What might this mean for the system as a whole?  What does it actually mean for a spirit to be ""goetic"" other than the original conception of 72 spirits bound by Solomon?

I know that some are obviously old Gods who were *demonized* or something like that.  I'm also assuming that Solomon bound *just* 72 spirits...maybe there were a ton more he never got around to tormenting.

I'm feeling like it's entirely possible for new spirits to join the group commonly known as Goetic.  I'm not sure what exactly that might mean in terms of definition...perhaps they vibrate or just have that feel.

Has anyone else come across new Goetics?  Has anyone heard stories from old Goetics about how they got to be what they are?

Something I haven't really seen on here, which I think is an interesting subject, is the use of skill development as a generalised learning and self-exploration tool.

If I can bring your attention to the concept of flow [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)]  (some call it being in the zone, centered, single-minded, etc):

&gt; Nakamura and Csíkszentmihályi identify the following six factors as encompassing an experience of flow.


&gt; 1. intense and focused concentration on the present moment
&gt; 2. merging of action and awareness
&gt; 3. a loss of reflective self-consciousness
&gt; 4. a sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity
&gt; 5. a distortion of temporal experience, one's subjective experience of time is altered
&gt; 6. experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, also referred to as autotelic experience


&gt;Those aspects can appear independently of each other, but only in combination they constitute a so-called flow experience.

This state seem to often occur when performing tasks that we are highly skilled and that pose a high level of challenge. Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Challenge_vs_skill.svg 

This seems like a fairly intuitive idea to me and it is something I have been experimenting with for a while now through the targeted development of skills in a variety of areas. Personally, I have chosen areas that I find to be particularly practical or interesting to me (professional skills, physical training, musical instruments, cooking, etc).

At a surface level, the benefits are pretty obvious - higher performance and more satisfaction. But over a longer-term application I have found that the 'flow' state, starts to come much easier. I find, given the right frame of mind, it can be self-induced on tasks that it usually would not occur on (like sweeping the floor or washing the dishes). This really allows for a greatly heightened ability to focus on just about any task, problem or idea. Over time it becomes possible to enter into a state of deep insight on an increasingly broader scope of activities. Conceptually, it seems comparable with meditative experience.

Basically, what I'm talking about is a broad, practical approach to gnosis via direct experience in any activity you choose. I find skill-development in multiple areas to be particularly effective because it illuminates the common thread in manifestly incongruent activities.

I want to learn more and (I think) even begin practicing, but I'm not sure exactly where to start.

After some research, I came across the IOT North America website (http://iota.thanateros.org/chaos.php) and once again I'm thoroughly fascinated.

It seems like they have a pretty good base-plan laid out already for someone to get into this stuff.  It begins with reading Peter Carroll's *Liber Null and Psychonaut*, then there's a series of progressive steps to prove proficiency in the practice, and then the process culminates with applying to become an IOT member.  Again, I find the whole thing fascinating.

My question is:  Are these guys for real?  Is the average IOT member the way I ideally would picture them (incredibly interesting and well-read people like Robert Anton Wilson, Grant Morrisson, and Alan Moore), or is the average IOT member more like a nerdy disillusioned weirdo who just happened to get into the occult instead of Live Action Role Playing or Dungeons and Dragons? 

(sorry if I offend anyone with the LARP and D&amp;D analogy, it's not my intent but I can't think of a better way to phrase it).

I am asking because I am increasingly finding it to be a word that lacks a coherent definition that gets passed off with hand waving and ""ooohs"" and ""ums"".


Edit:

It is fascinating to see what everyone perceives it as! We seem to have 3 camps.

1. A kind of western equivalent of the Tao that hangs out the back of class and kisses girls/fundamental nature and origin of the universe made out of acasual manifestations of infinite potential or something along those lines.

2. A force for change that exists equally with other forces in the universe.

3. A more romantic name for 'entropy' the great kicker of sand castles. 

It may very well be one of those words like 'God' or 'Art' that is only defined not by its relation with other words but by what you are willing to project onto it. A linguistic blank page.

I know 2012 is a worn out subject and no longer cool, but my question is more to do with your thoughts on the phenomenon around it.

As magicians I think its vital for us to monitor the memes and currents in society at large. 

So, why has this become such a huge thing, and why have so many different variations been put forwards from people from totally different world views? How come this date, this set of numbers, has saturated our collective pop-culture mind in so many different ways compared to any other esoteric ultimatum? 

And ultimately, will something actually happen because people are so intensely focused on it and there is no clear agreement on what will actually happen, leaving events open to many kinds of interpretation?

Here it is:

---

A small but important point I think: I am coming to the conclusion that sorcery and shamanism are related but quite distinct. I was actually talking with a researcher who did a simple brainwave study on alleged evil sorcerers vs. healing shamans. He found that, during their trance states, the sorcerers were in delta waves and the shamans in theta waves (iirc). He was actually able to predict their sorcerer vs shaman status by their trance brainwaves.

Sorcery is not ""evil,"" but it is transgressive. It transgresses the boundaries of normality into liminal experiences, abnormal realities, i.e., planeswalking. A lot of psychonautics is sorcery. Shamanism shares principles, worldviews, and legends with sorcery, but it is primarily about healing and ""white magic"" (think Buddhist peace-mundanity-meditation vs. Christian death-worship identity self-combustion).

Sorcery comes to us in ""tales of power,"" whereas shamans are not primarily concerned with power, but with pragmatic healing techniques (including the mythology).

Deleuze is a great place to start for more on this perspective of sorcery.

1368989555.0,15,self.occult,1en7ee,A short treatise to reconcile differences between decks,clow_reed,18,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1en7ee/a_short_treatise_to_reconcile_differences_between/,"[The reader]

My first comment is about the reader. Some readers (diviners) will read the emotional means of the cards, without looking at the book or descriptions. Or some object in the card catches the diviners attention and mentions it. These types are incredibly intuitive.

The other type of reader is to remember what the descriptions are, and blend the descriptions into the reading. If the card's description says it, that's what it means. No more, no less. They mainly try to remove the intuitive aspect for a scientific aspect that can be repeated.

Depending on what kind of reading I am doing, I will do different styles of reading as above. For other people, I will almost always do an intuitive reading. However, if for myself, I will use a deck I am less familiar with and I will do a straight ""whats the card say in the lil' white book?"". I have found that method does lessen my bias on my own readings about stuff in my life. However, I do prefer intuitive readings by far.

[The Cards]

The next area is the decks themselves. We have 4 main lineages of decks: RWS, Thoth, Osho Zen-like, and Historical decks (Visconti-Sforza, Marseilles). There are other decks that have carved their own niche, like Motherpeace or Book of Shadows Tarot (wicca learning deck).

The lineages are important, as to know which system you are using. RWS is considered the gold standard for standard tarot decks. You want a learning deck? Go to RWS. You want a deck anybody will recognize? Go to RWS. Are the pictures as beautiful and clean and vibrant colored compared to the more recent decks? Nope. But you will know what you get with it.

Thoth is one of those weird ones that Crowley worked with. The first noticeable alteration is the elemental attributions to Swords and Wands are flipped. This can cause immediate confusion. Secondly, many cards are darker than others seem to be in other decks. However, nicely done is the Kaballaistic attributions on each card, along with astrological comparisons. However, to utilize his system, you need to study his base of beliefs. And it was also understood that many pitfalls and traps were placed here as well.

Osho Zen is one of those weird tarot~but not tarot decks. The book does match each appropriate card to the standard 78 tarot cards. However, much work was done to turn each card introspective as a magnifying lens on the querant. This is one of the few decks I mind not reading myself intuitively, because the cards really do pop out at you. This system tries to clean superfluous systems and attributions, as to get to the heart of a matter.

Lastly, we have the older (pre-RWS) decks. Two of the famous decks are Marseilles and Visconti-Sforza. The first noticeable thing about these decks are they they almost always have pip cards for the minor arcana. In other words, they are stylized forms of current playing cards. 3 of disks gets you three disks on a card. 7 of swords means there's 7 swords. And the royals of each minor are usually a nice flowery painting of a King, Queen, knight, or page. You could take out the majors and the knight from the deck, and you have a nice set of playing cards. Nobody would think otherwise. Now, the majors are much more detailed, and given the ""witchcraft words"". However, where we think of High Priestess, we can alternatively see La Papessa, or the Popess. The Magician in a RWS deck shows the elemental weapons, but the older decks use the term il Bagatto, or The Juggler. The major arcana can have fairly different meanings than what we are accustomed to. The other trap is you will have to learn the minor via rote memory.

[The reconciliation]

So now, we have seen two types of a reading (intuitive, book), and 4 styles of decks. So, how do we reconcile between decks and their books that have fairly different divination meanings? My own answer is that you do not. For those that have intuitively worked with a few decks, know each deck has its own feeling; its own language. Dark Grimoire (Tarocchi del Necronomicon) has a radically different feel than the Transparent tarot. It is important to understand the lineage of the deck as to ascertain how they came up with the meanings and attributions.

If you use Transparent Tarot, and are using a blended book-intuition or straight book, use the Transparent Tarot's book. If you're working with RWS, use a book that follows that book. If you're experimenting with Osho's Zen deck, use that book. We can do this between decks, because a deck creator almost always keeps a deck balanced within itself. A deck creator however, cannot easily balance the symbolism between the other thousands of other decks.

I have been blessed/cursed with extreme empathy, and a sensitive nervous system for as long as I can remember. When I was a teenager I dealt poorly with taking on everything, mostly due to lack of understanding by myself and of those around me with what was going on. I have been diagnosed with a plethora of disorders from manic-depressive to epileptic, to name a few. I was heavily drugged by my doctors for 4 years. None of my diagnosis ever seemed quite right, and in the present am a functioning adult, a bit eccentric, but without meds or medical disorders. Unless you count crazy sensitive as a disorder. It certainly has it's symptoms. 
I stayed over with the newly ex-boyfriend, and sleeping in his bed I dreamt of the last person he had sex with. No prior knowledge, and it has been confirmed by him. I am used to visions, though I don't usually take them to seriously, and I take  little issue with him having sex with someone else. But a part of me would rather just not know, and I feel like I have no choice in the matter in the energy that I pick up. This just being the most recent. Additionally, I have experienced chronic pain and migraines for almost 20 years that have no apparent reason that I think might be linked to energy more than I'd like to admit.

Being frank, have been living on a plane of addiction for the past 15 years or so. Booze is a big part of my life and it's become confused with 'the things I want in life.' 

A better way to put it, 'Was aiming there, ended up here.' -- in a fairly depressed state.  

Looking for a magic bullet. Feeling afraid. Finding the answer on /r/alcoholism has been a challenge because it's 12 steps. And it's 12 steps or you're not getting it. It's a box. Coming from a musical background where there's 12 tones, one would think a musical person would love it the most, but it's not 12 tones -- it's a 12 tone matrix. And that's just western theory. 

The appeal of the occult; sigils, harmony, communication, summoning, the power of within...symbology. That makes sense to me. 

Finding myself between the dual powers of taping into a small world contained in a cylindrical bottle of elixer (booze) and the rest of the living, cosmic bio-sphere (magic) -- a vacuum is created. Sometimes it's a big vacum and sometimes it's small. Either way it's a vacuum. There's not much air in it and what air there is get's stale quick. 

Here's a verbatim diary entry I wrote (for myself) while completely sober, describing what I was feeling coming off booze (don't hate I'm a comic book fan so there's some Stan Lee'isms, Phish'isms, lots of 'isms):

""Sobriety, for me right now, feels like gravity. As if to slip out of this world of ego and intoxication. Of being in a stupor. One has to slip out of this addicted reality, and enter the space of another, far more exciting and healthy planet. To escape the gravitational pull of this dying krypton it requires force and energy...propulsion. While in transit there is turbulance and a fantastic resistance. This, one of many infinite, possible, solutions to the question of who am i, has its own gravitational forces. And similar to taking flight, its normal to feel the g's pulling on your guts. Equilibrium gets a bit wonky. Head gets a bit dizzy. This gravity pulls on the psyche. All it wants is for me to fall, to slip into the bottle and inhabit the reality i helped imagine into existence in the first place. Its the way it always has been and the way it will always be. The exciting thing is that proves that it is real. Just as soon as one temporal plane is departed, soon another one will arrive. Each land more different and beautiful than the last. Each one, for a while, home. 

So when the force shock of blasting out of one reality, in defiance of resistances gravity force, the twisting and pressure, the initial anxiousness of flight, consume the unitiated, or the weary traveler -- its never because one chooses to direct their lives, thought, imagination, passion, energy, love, desire into something new. Its because they lingered in the resistance too long. 

Alan carr put it, the discomfort is not from stopping drinking. Its from starting drinking. 

I started drinking around 16 or 17 years old. Im now 35. More than half my life. Its understandable that there be an exhilarating rush as i blast off that plane and seek out another. 

The spirit of adventure burns. Unroll the map, time to quest a new level of perception. Check back in with the stars i charted so long ago. With great power comes great responsibility. For i have been waylaid by resistances sweet kiss. I know it is here, for i feel it on my chest. Its plans laid plain for all to see. Time kick into the high gear of the soul.""

I got into the chaos magic when I was sixteen-ish. It's worked really well for me, using whatever techniques that worked toward my ends, and at nineteen to twenty I improved greatly.

However, for a couple years, I've suffered from cyclical bouts of major depression. (They seem to come during the cold season.) Not simple deep sadness, but the fullblown MDD 'can't feel emotions, no willpower, no focus, no energy, I'm always only 1/4 of my real self' style of depression. Serious shit.

**TLDR:**

I'm in a depressive state now that I've been in for three months at least. Last year I was in the same state, though not quite so rough, at the same time of year. I can always feel when I'm entering and leaving the state, surprisingly. Last year, I felt myself exit the depression when I read a series of magic articles on chaosmatrix.org. Something about the magic of the articles seemed to pull me out of it.

About two weeks ago, I was reading a bunch of articles on magic. Suddenly, I seemed to be slipping out of the state, filled with renewed power and energy, contentedness and possibility. (You're talking to someone who hasn't even experienced contentedness, let alone happiness, for the last three months before this.) Days, weeks later now, and it seems like I never actually came out of the depression really, though. There's always a longlasting rebound effect of increased energy after, along with a feeling of knowing surely I was out of it.

My exits from depression always involve magic, (reviving my interest in magic through reading, renewing friendships with mage friends, life challenges that challenge me to find new magical ways to overcome problems, etc) as do my big growths and changes in life. But this false/partial coming-out, though it seemed like it was going to bring me back into non-depression, just didn't do the job.

So, shit.

I've been an occultist for years after being raised Catholic, but I only just recently discovered this subreddit and find it to be more intelligent in its discussion than other magickal forums. My focuses have mostly been Chaos Magick with a little Thelema and Rune Work. I took the OTO Minerval when I first became interested in the Occult then fell out of that path though I do plan to revisit it when I'm older. Since then, I've mostly focused on personal Chaos work under whatever paradigm works best for me at the time.

Now a question so it's not all about me:

Was the best read I've had in years and it's what got me into the Occult.",memystic,26,11,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/14hl3i/has_anyone_else_read_memetic_magick_was_the_best/,"I want to spark a conversation on how ""memes"" relate to Occult ideas.

Here's a [picture of the book](http://www.caminomarketing.com/stuff/memetic-magick.jpg).

I started off studying memetics (how ideas spread through society like a virus, are subject to darwinian natural selection, etc) and finally bought this book on Amazon for about $100. I actually pirated the pdf but was so captivated by the ideas I **had** to buy it. Note: Another great book comparing the Occult and memetics is [The Art of Memetics](http://www.artofmemetics.com) which can be read for free at the link provided.

It's fascinating that an ""Egregore"" can be compared to a corporation, or similar organization. A collection of ideas all feeding off each other. The ""Spirit"" of the organization is created at the beginning (Apple is a great example) and begins to take on a life of its own -- even after the original founders are gone, the ideas instilled in the company live on. I believe the book went on to describe two ""God Forms"" guiding the United States; [Columbia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_(name) and [Uncle Sam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Sam).

The two books I listed go on about a great deal many more subjects so I strongly encourage anyone into this sort of stuff to download and read both books. [The Art of Memetics](http://www.artofmemetics.com) talks a lot about cybernetic theory, how it relates to memetics and the Occult. Very interesting stuff! 

What are your thoughts on this sort of Magick?

I've been interested in the occult for a long time, but never in any serious way.  The thought of metaphysics, magic, and even psychic potential always appealed to me, but I never really took any effort to 'study' it.

Found this sub-reddit however, and read the FAQ, wondering what I would be seeing, and saw something that I found interesting.  Chaos Magic(k).  (I spell it without the K, dunno if that's appropriate or not here.)  I read the description of it and was kinda shocked.  The concepts/beliefs presented in that very much match how I feel about the world in general, the idea that, at the end of the day, it matters less what you do, but *why* you do it.  And you get to choose the why yourself.

Normally, I'd write this stuff off, but that's...  I dunno, a little too coincidental.  I know I'm just attracted to the idea that maybe others see the world the way that I do, a way that, in my experience, is outside the boundaries of what most people are taught.

Unfortunately, I can't afford the literature.  Yay for starving college students, right?  So, maybe someone can point me in the right direction?  I still don't know that I buy any of this, the idea of intuitive knowledge.  I'm definitely the type that likes empirical evidence, but I do like to think I'm open minded enough to at least take what's given to me at face value and decide for myself if it's worth pursuing or not.

I dunno about the idea of 'Practicing,' but gaining some deeper understanding beyond simple definitions of what's what would be a nice start.

---------------
**EDIT/UPDATE:**  The literature so far is very interesting.  I'm no where near finished with this particular resource, and still have many more to go, but so far, the pieces I've read are generally very well written.  The people writing this, and I assume perhaps the people whom are part of this sub-reddit, genuinely believe what they're saying, at the very least.  And there are too many who are clearly intelligent for me to write them off as simply mad...  And a couple of bits I've read are simply...  Well, again, too coincidental.  But this time in a very strange way, at least from my perspective.

If for nothing more than satisfying a morbid curiosity, this is definitely worth my time, and I'd like to thank all the posters for being helpful, candid, and respectful.

---------
**EDIT/UPDATE 2:**  I'd like to thank you all for your support, patience, and assistance with this.  I'm still not *entirely* sure I buy all this, but it's been a weird ride that just keeps getting weirder, so I'm going to see where it takes me.  I'm starting with some basic sigils.

Bluefirephoenix, I'm working on...  Conjuring?  Orobrus, but between practicing getting his sigil down pat, and actually thinking of a question that falls into his (its?) realm, I'm at something of an impasse.  It also sounds like something that might require a lucid dream for me, and I'm not entirely sure I'll have the time and resources to make that work at the moment.  It might just require some strong visualization, and that I can do, but it'll take me a while.

But to repeat a question I just posted in this thread, are the commonly used/accepted forms of entering a gnostic state the only ways of achieving it, or is it possible that something more personal to me would be more effective?

--------
**EDIT/UPDATE 3:**  I just wanted to say thank you to everyone again.  I'm trying some things and running into some roadblocks, but I believe I understand what this is all about now, at least to some extent.

More importantly though, this strange and insane experience has given me something.  I went out with my Mom last night, and found myself talking about my philosophy of life and the way I see the world, and not feeling insane for doing so.  The conversation came up naturally, and she was very understanding, and even supportive, of the strange-ness I see in day-to-day life, not counting the absolutely bizarre stuff I've experienced these last couple of days...  I kinda omitted the bit about, you know...  This.  She's Catholic, not sure how she'd feel about all this, so I skirted that.  But the extra little boost in confidence has been really nice.  Just knowing there's a place where my philosophy is valid, and even normal to some extent, has been...  Helpful?  Nice?  I dunno how to articulate it, but it feels good.  I don't feel so alone now.

Show me the way.,SinisterChuckles,22,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/13esg4/what_is_the_occult_show_me_the_way/,"I'll submit my opinion with the premise that this is neither my original interpretation nor an propose empirical definition. I think the occult mind attempts to utilize the modes of thought and the symbolism of different traditions as a unique way to explore the mind. Israel Regardie defined magic as a ""mnemonic system of psychology."" A lot of this, I think, can be tied to more contemporary myth theorists and psychologists of religion who will very rationally assert that the human brain is adapted to thrive in the contexts of certain experiences which might be defined as ""religious.""  That the ""practice"" of occult systems can be seen as a kind of ""user interface"" for the mind. The fact that we are adapted to perceive correspondence and causality in nature in such specific ways is an important fact to consider when evaluating the plausibility of an esoteric system of thought. Despite whatever scientific conclusions we might come to embrace in our frontal cortex, occultism attempts to penetrate into the layers of the animal mind and to utilize the the persisting merits of those strata of our consciousness. 

I realize that might sound really pseudo-scientific. But from an occult standpoint, I think its an appropriate perspective. I think the true goal of occultism is to interact with consciousness in unique ways. The occult experience is ultimately validated on a completely experiential stage. Objectivity is an illusion. The notion (and most importantly the relevance) of ""empirical data"" is one which is ultimately usurped by the quality of your conscious experience. To add ""faith"" or religion as ingredients in this laboratory is dangerous. They are potential contaminants and, I believe, serve more often to congest the occult process of transformation than to promote it. 

So I obviously have some opinions and I obviously want to dialogue about this. My question at this point is: ""Where should I go next?""

TL;DR",Heyutl,17,3,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/125ti3/id_like_to_share_a_memory_with_you_all_in_hopes/,"Let's get this straight before I go any further. I'm not making this up, nor have I ever tried to implant a false memory into myself. This is pretty much my first memory, but as time goes on, and I grow older, it gets a little more cloudy. Only two people in real life know my memory (my parents might remember me asking them about it, but they've always dismissed everything as my ""imagination"") because it's something very personal. When I could actually formulate sentences and talk on my own, this was one of the first questions I asked my parents, but like I said, they told me it was all in my head.
So why share it here? Because this is the internet where you can be yourself without IRL ridicule. 
Here it goes; A couple of months after I was born, I was taken to Saint Mary's Catholic Church to be christened. I remember riding in my parents' car in my shitty little child seat, watching the world go by through the windows and staring at the top of the interior. Once we got there, I was taken out of the seat and carried inside. My older sister was getting baptized on the same day. On the way into the church, I remember seeing two people, clad in black (there's more detail to their clothing, not straight black, but like I said, it's hazy now) standing beside the entrance watching me. Now as you all should know, infants are extremely sensitive to energies and I wasn't getting a bad feeling from them, in fact quite the opposite, and I remember my Mother asking my Father what I was staring at, but they didn't see anything; except my Father guessed I was looking at a bush. After we passed them and through the door, they followed, but I couldn't see them for awhile because they tended to stay out of the way of everyone. I remember Mass taking place, then my sisters' baptism. Then it was my turn to be christened. I remember being being picked up, and I remember not wanting to do whatever it was they were about to do with me. When I started crying I saw those two figures making their way towards me, towards the basin. Around this time, things started to seem to slow down, everyone else was moving slower than these two people clad in black. They did have defining characteristics, but I can't even recall them now-a-days because I've put it off for so long. When I was next to the basin, time almost stopped. Everything was moving incredibly slow, but them. As I got towards the basin, the man knelt down, said something grabbed my head and pressed our foreheads together. He then retreated to the wall right behind the basin and stood there watching. Then the lady also knelt down, said something else, grabbed my head and kissed my forehead. As soon as she got back to the mans side, time started to flow normally again. Then I got christened. They stayed there for a bit, followed me back out to my car, and have only seen them once since, several years later. I felt like I know who they were, that there was a deep connection between us, but I was so young I had no idea, and when I asked my parent's about this happening, both christening and afterwards, they just dismissed it as my imagination. I know it's not. This shakes me to my core thinking about it. I've been trying to get more details but it's a difficult process. I need to know what these people were and why they acted as they did towards me. I'm not looking for an answer here, just suggestions, because this is something I have to find out for myself. If you want to call BS on it, I don't mind, but I KNOW this is true. Why else would it shake me to the core like it does? What does it mean? There are too many questions to this but it's all so confusing. Are there any subjects I could read on to get a better understanding, or am I batshit insane.... Goddess I hope not. This took me three days to compile and to gain the courage to put it on here. I thought though that maybe someone out there has something they can offer me, advice, books, anything, so I may find out. It's been bothering me for years, and I had it so locked up that it came back to me in a very vague dream which stirred everything back up. Every time I think on this, I get chills, but also a calming sensation. I don't know where else to turn to, so maybe someone can help. I apologize for the rant....

TL;DR Had something really strange happen at my christening, and I don't know who I saw or what they were, or were to me..

It matters because this isn't the Canada I grew up in. Stephen Harper has single-handedly undone years of progress; the country that was once a beacon of hope and tolerance is becoming another American state. 

I ask if you care, please write your local and provincial representatives and tell them that this is inexcusable. Write the fuckhead himself and let him know that your vote will be going to ANYONE but the Conservative party. And most of all, I implore you to use your esoteric talents to turn this situation around. Bind those involved; encourage the blossoming of compassion, whatever! Just do SOMETHING.

**Some ideas that deserve highlighting:**

Much kudos to Sunny_McJoyride for noticing that ROCULAPEGROS is an anagram of ""Group's Oracle"". I wish I could take credit for being that clever but I assure you that it was completely unintentional. 

[revg23's sigilization](http://i.imgur.com/XABYS.jpg) and Cosmicduder's idea of using the reddit alien as form of the spirit. A combination of the two could be easily facilitated using this sub's current logo as a template of sorts. It would definitely make visualization a lot easier!

As for the ritual proper, I'm in the process of writing a modified version of [Chapman and Barford's ritual](http://oeith.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/entrancesritual.pdf) used in their [Entrances to Hell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqg_wjkdQco&amp;feature=g-user-u) video. I will be incorporating Rimbon's suggested mantra and call as they are superb. Of course, I will submit the finished product to you all for approval and suggestions.

Gingor gave some great tips on astrologically auspicious moments for holding the ritual. Astrological magick is not my forte, so if anyone else would like to add more to this vein of conversation feel free. Samhain was also suggested, but that would not work for me personally as my wedding anniversary is a few days prior leaving indisposed for most of the week. Regardless, I'm all ears as for a time and day. 

As always, I leave the floor open to other suggestions and thanks again for those who have already done so. ",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,False,,,True,t3_zimop,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/zimop/roculapegros_update_1/,

Also possibly brainstorm a few exercises or activities that each person could do based on what was discussed and have another thread a few days later to discuss the experiences and results.  Possibly create a new sub so as not to clutter up r/occult too much.

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. It would be fascinating to find some candidates from the Occult community and hear their perspectives. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, 2012 we’ll hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME and all places in between (and then back). Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions, but our hope is that the conversation will continue long after the breakfast dishes are cleared. How? We’ll start here and see where it ripples out:

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration,

Been an occult practitioner since long before I discovered DnD but there was a couple of similarities that I spotted and the words are appropriate.

I'm guessing most of you would have gone through what my boyfriend went through. Became curious about the topic as early as his teen years and dug out all the books that Sunday school warned against. He grew up in a SUPER conservative part of South Africa that some have fondly called ""back water."" His knowledge of traditional magics and writings is quite impressive. With the strong theoretical back ground he has he can achieve some awesome things.

My personal experience was without books and with intuition. Around the age of 11 I realised there was more to the world than the physical. Started playing with the concept of psychic phenomena. I got pretty good. Had a buddy I would practice with. Then high school happened, lost contact with buddy and I was a bit of a social shut in for the longest time. Only encouragement I had really was the mother of one of my best friends, who was very spiritually open. She did the Reiki, aura cleansing and spirit cards but encouraged curiosity. That was the first time I ever visited an occult store. Didn't have any guidance though so I bought a couple of random books. One still doesn't make sense to me (Sacred Geometry) and the other I could see the point of but pruned out so much frippery that what's left could be a pamphlet. (Some orange book about spirit summoning.) I didn't even have decent Internet access until I left for university so I couldn't look for resources online. Net result was that what I had learnt was purely from experimenting with philosophies and all self discovered. Down side is I battle to read any occult text without getting bored now. They read like Shakespeare without the plot, characters or setting. (And I like some of Shakespeare's works!) Magically speaking I also lack finesse. I tend to fire off spells as if I were hurling grenades.

So if you have any knowledge of DnD you'll see the links there. Bf is a wizard and I'm a sorcerer. He gets magic from study and books and teachers. I found magic by trial and intuition, possibly stemming from heritage. (More on that if you ask.)

Some months ago I did an AmA over at r/AmA that was (mostly) well received considering how the rest of Reddit operates. I thought it would be fun to extend the AmA to you but I do not wish to stop there - I invite anyone to ask a question and anyone to answer that question. Many times we never ask a question because we are never presented with the opportunity to, the Occult path is centric to having these questions asked AND answered expediently and I believe having an active thread where these questions can be asked is central to our little community here. 

It is with this AmA that I invite you to ask me a question, or r/occult at large and get an answer. Bear in mind that some things have changed since I did my AmA about 4 months ago, as they always do. I am still involved with a Hermetic Order and will happily answer questions having to do with life in an order but please bear in mind that we have no affiliation with OtO or A,',A,', nor do we wish to. We do however, happily entertain all things Thelemic/Golden Dawn inspired. 

Since I am breaking my Order's mandated privacy I am re-using my old throwaway and will make no mention of the account I normally use to comment on r/Occult. As Crowley said, Magick is for everyone. I also want to stress again, while I will personally respond to all the questions here, I invite anyone to answer any questions asked in this thread, I also would like to state that this thread is NOT about myself but I will publicly answer questions about myself in an effort to help educate the Neophytes/Adepts curious enough to ask.

2. create a sigil

--------Borrowed----------

Please consult with your doctor before attempting this, or any other exercise.

This is a blog post about prostration as a means of manifesting anything you want. Prostration must begin as something that feels as a poison to your mouth. Evidence of favoring prostration is evidence of being a sissy (not that there is a right and wrong here; I’m just sayin’). You must however be fully prepared to work yourself into a state of complete groveling, and complete surrender to a higher power. That’s right, I said it. Basically, in a purely allegorical sense, you will have to open yourself up to what equates to spiritual “bum rape”.

In my practice, I find this requires me to exercise my body beyond a state of egoic reactions to pain and physical exhaustion. For some reason, I’ve got it in my head (personality) that I am some sort of bad ass that is God Him/Her Self (capital S), and from this perspective there is no ego to even prostrate. This is all very well and good; and really I’m just the biggest dork, but to get what you want you have to use a physical medium. Remember, the point of this is to manifest anything you want, period.

That’s right, I am guaranteeing your success if you can manage to pull off this exercise, for whatever you want. Be careful what you wish for.

1,000 Bows. That’s right, 1,000 consecutive bows.

1. Stand with your feet together and your arms at your side.
2. Raise your arms up over your head so your palms touch above your 7th chakra (crown)
3. Keeping your palms together, lower your arms into prayer position in front of your 4th chakra (sol)
4. Keeping your knees straight (but not locked), bend at the waist with a straight spine and open the energy along your entire bladder meridian (back of legs, either side of spine, over the top of your head, and ending where your eyes meet your nose … Cheth, 418, Cancer)
5. Engage your 2nd chakra (Luna) as you re-straighten your spine, while simultaneously (and with control) bending your knees to the ground; your hands remain in prayer in front of your chest as you sit on your heals, bending at the toes, with your knees on the ground.
6. Place both palms onto the ground in front of you, place your forehead on the ground in between your palms, prostrate to the earth.
7. Keeping your forehead on the ground, raise your palms to the sky with your elbows still touching the ground, prostrate to heaven.
8. Sit up and bring your hands into prayer in front of your chest and keeping your feet together, stand up. (it is permissible, however weak, to support your body with your hands if you can’t stand up on your own … wimp)
9. As you return to a standing position, with your hands in prayer, briefly acknowledge your humanity as the union of heaven and earth.
10. Repeat

That’s it. This usually takes about 2 hours. It is helpful to chant some kind of sacred mantra or text one word or character per bow. This assists in the deepening of trance, and the letting go of all the physical pain, emotional outbursts, and mental junk that is released through this process in most practitioners. Chanting can also help keep track of the counting. For example, chanting a sacred text of 100 characters 10 times while doing this exercise will generate all kinds of Powerful Gnosis that simply gets jacked into your intent.

This is a form of prayer, of begging for what you want.

I will repeat if you are in lousy physical shape, you could be injured in attempting this exercise. Getting a number of practitioners together for this will increase the total energy generated, and the one mind created in mutual practice will also make the exercise easier and safer.

I prefer solitary, me against Choronzon.

If you achieve the physical and energetic development necessary to do 1,000 bows while remaining at peace in thought, body, and mind … then you can do 3,000 or 10,000. It sounds ludicrous I know, but these states of purity can be developed with daily practice. If you can easily do 1,000 of these bows, then you probably don’t need help or exercises to manifest what you want when you want it. Think about it. You can also train for 1,000 bows by doing 21 per day, then increasing to 100. If you can easily do 100 bows everyday, then you can handle a marathon of 1,000.

1,000 bows before ritual work will blow your mind. Try it. Especially if your work involves traveling in the spirit vision, or crystal/mirror gazing. 1,000 bows will whack you out in a way glorious for Gnosis generation. If you think an orgasm snuffs out the flame of your ego, then 1,000 bows is going to bury the whole candle in sand.

Getting over yourself can be difficult. Once the body is pushed past the point of exhaustion, the emotions give up, and the thought is silenced … then you have the opportunity to let go. This is something that gets a lot of words on paper, 1,000 bows guarantees it in 2 hours.

The rule in the Sanga from which I learned this practice was this:

If you have no desire for sex after the practice, you have completed your 2nd chakra (Luna, Yesod)
If you have no desire for food after this practice, you have completed your 4th chakra (Sol, Tiphareth)
If you have no desire for sleep after this practice, you have completed your 6th chakra (Uranus, Daleth of Chokmah and Binah)

As an Enochian Magician, I find this practice invaluable. It works as a substitute for long passages of prayer. Doing 100 bows to an Angel to compel its manifestation works every time I do it. It also opens and strengthens the subtle energy body of the practitioner, which is necessary to prevent overload from strong currents of energy typical in the Enochian System.

Here is my stab at it: follow your work. 

Don't overthink it, what stands out to you?

 Is it tarot, tarot is an amazing tool that goes way beyond divination, same with runes and the i-ching. Start using it. Give yourself a reading, do some meditation and/or visualization on your gear. Your work will begin to provide a gentle pull in some direction, you will sense it. 

Is your impulse and interest towards sigils? make a sigil, light it on fire, or better yet cum on it. Watch the universe begin to turn its burning eye towards you, and eventually through you. 

Are you an aspiring Qabalist? Pick a sephiroth and climb towards it. Meditate and do vision work up to it, if you really want to go buck wild mix it with tarot. Just let yourself hear your will. 

Are you into the dark stuff? Do some rituals, do some meditations and vision work on the Qlipphoth. 

Scrying? One can buy a Ouija board at the toy store. One can turn a thrown away television into a black mirror. 

I have only listed a few techniques, it seems the list is extremely vast. But each of you has something that appeals to you, something that your interest gravitates towards. Get to work. Do whatever you can, your work will evolve through a process of self discovery. 

Is this stuff dangerous? It can be. At least for your mental health. But there are things to do for that, find some and start doing them. I could list off my techniques (banishing rituals, etc.) but then I would be contradicting my advice. 

This thing is coming from deep inside you. And I think we can all agree on some level this thing is coming from beyond you. That seems to be the true point. 

Don't be overly cautious. You will adapt, and you will mend your own work as you practice it. As you  actually do it.

I tried to make contact with the greys an awful lot when I was a child. 

I was absolutely obsessed with UFO's and read books on alien abduction ( I was totally jealous of all the abductees that got to chill with bros from another planet) every night then spook myself silly trying to fall asleep. 

I had no idea about all this occult stuff at the time but essentially what I would do is visualize on drawings I did on greys/crop circles and try to contact them with my mind. I remember even going out into a park with rocks in a circle formations that I thought looked somewhat like a landing strip for a UFO and attempting to turn my body into a psychic beacon to call down the aliens to reveal themselves. Apparently a few people think this is dangerous because the greys are apparently evil and all that.

Either I was completely unsuccessful or they wiped my mind really well.

What I have realized is that many of the basic occult practices that I have learned mirror what I was doing as a kid.

I have a kind of psychological question, and while this is the occult subreddit, y'all seem to be very knowledgeable about human psychology- maybe more so than any other subreddit.

First, a little background on me. I think I've always been an introspective kind of person. I've almost always had a circle of friends as a kid through my teen years, but I would also spend alot of time alone- and have often thought of myself as more individualistic/less involved in the group. I experienced alot of lonely feelings growing up, but I could compensate for it through using my rich imagination, or spending time outside and feeling connected to nature.
I think the older I got, the more time I spent being entranced by technological screens (tv, computer, etc), and less connected to nature and my imagination. However, believing my parents' religion (Christianity) still gave the world a bit of a soul for me.

When I moved away from home, my loneliness increased greatly. I still made friends, but they were not enough. I became extremely religious for a time (Christianity again), and this seemed to be a temporary antidote to the loneliness. Eventually, I could no longer see the truth in Christianity, and lost my faith. I turned to existentialist philosophy for a time, and learned to see myself as more or less confined to my individuality, in an unfeeling, materialistic universe that lacked soul. This was not appealing to me, but I tried to sort of ""grin and bear it"".

One day, my psyche experienced an awful rupture. I felt as though my mind was tearing in half, or that the universe was bearing down and about to crush me. I felt like the most alone, isolated being in the universe, and this knowledge was enough put me on the precipice of annihilation. I could barely even accomplish day to day tasks. I soon had to spend almost 100% of time in the company of other people- to distract myself from the all consuming aloneness that was threatening my mind. This was good for me in a sense- I formed many beautiful relationships as a result of this pressure. But the experience itself has permanently altered me (I think).

I have never since felt as awful as I did for those weeks and months (happened 3 years ago). But there is some low level disturbance in my mind much of the time. Often times I feel very disconnected from the world. I have friends and family in my life, but often cannot connect emotionally with them or feel love for them. In my childhood, I could look at the sky and imagine all kinds of awesome things taking place just beyond the horizon. Nowadays, looking at the sky reminds me of the fundamental hollowness or emptiness of the world. I feel as though I live in a world of surfaces, a world that has lost its depth, lost the soul. It is mostly inert matter. Often times I don't feel at home in the world, or the universe, and it seems very alien and unfamiliar to me. Like being cosmically homeless, or a foreigner. Nature doesnt speak to me much. I am still very congnizant of cosmic aloneness. I think it is a problem of disconnection. It has led me to become obsessed with meaningfulness, and so I am relentlessly searching to find this meaning, connectedness, whatever it is that will make me feel alive. The fear of being confined in this feeling drives many of my decisions and also makes it hard for me to make any decision I think will lead me back to it. It is a very upsetting feeling- it feels fearful to live in an alien world.

For years I have framed this as a spiritual problem. With my atheism has come a soulless universe, unenchanted and unconnected- and this creates the problem. Or perhaps I need to become enlightened in the tradition of the perennial philosophy. Or eternally live in the present. Thats what I've thought the issue is for quite awhile. Or maybe a sociological one- that I live in a disconnected, materialistic, exploitative culture. But I'm starting to believe that the problem is probably just as much inside me as it is ""out there"". I just thought I was more perceptive and sensitive to reality than most people, but maybe thats a delusion.  Recently I have come across a psychological term called derealization- which kind of describes what I've been feeling. And this derealization is often created as a compensation for anxiety, or a way of dealing with unwanted thoughts and feelings- a sort of distancing from fearful unconscious contents. 

Does anybody have experience with this bizarre and unsettling feeling- of being unmoored from everything? Of being not at home in the world? Feeling like you don't belong or fit into the world (not socially, but in a very fundamental way)? Of derealization? What do you think it is? How is it dealt with?

I would really appreciate any and all input. I know its kind of a self centered question, but I feel that it must intersect with occult thinking in some way.

I had a friend from reddit I talked to and she explained all the beliefs and practices to me, and for a while I began to believe in it and one night I decided to give thanks to 2 demons which had protected and helped her and her fiance. I hailed the names of the two demons in Latin, then asked for their protection against negative energies. 

I did NOT expect what happened afterwards at all. I saw, in my 3rd eye, what appeared to be a GIGANTIC black consciousness about the size of the Earth or more, towering above my own and it was about to engulf my consciousness. It was the most horrifying but beautiful thing I have ever seen in my entire life. 

I didn't sense any negativity from the spirit but I've had anxiety problems for an entire month now. I've began seeing things that aren't there from the corner of my eye, things like white figures and ""ghostly"" looking figures. I've had disturbing thoughts that have sent me into anxiety attacks and overall this entire experience has not been fun. I realize that my anxiety is not the cause of some sort of spiritual oppression but the side effects of trauma. I do not think I'm under any demonic oppression or anything.

------

My friend got in contact with a priestess who in return contacted one of the demons. The demon responded to my problems by saying that I was *initially* being punished for dabbling in religions I wasn't apart of, and a minor gray was making it worse. I don't feel like I'm being ""punished"" any more since it happened a month ago and I've been on a steady but slow recovery ever since. 

I've had a plethora of experiences ever since then. I once felt what I assumed to be the Holy Spirit speaking through me in song and I've felt two light consciousnesses fighting off one consciousness in my mind while my father laid hands on me and prayed in tongues. I've had my television cut on and off 4 times the day after I experienced what I thought to be the Holy Spirit and I've felt my anxiety drain out of me after asking God to stop what I was feeling. (Most notably after a nightmare related to the satanic occult, which an entity named ""Enki"" came to me and tried to make me submit and to quote the dream ""My name is Enki, I have come to make your life a living hell"")

I have never done any sort of ritual or practice in the occult and I have talked to so many people looking for answers. None can supply me with anything really satisfactory and knowledgeable, so I've come here. Do any of you know anything about the phenomenon I've experienced and what I should do to better myself from the experiences?

UPDATE 1: Well, I hoped to get it all done tonight. However, there were many issues that presented themselves. To start, the guy in the lumber section cut one of the legs maybe a 1/4"" too short. Then my buddy's cordless drill was running out of juice, and in my impatience, I tried to make it work anyway and stripped a few screws. The board I used for the table top seems to be a little more warped than I thought, as well. However, the show must go on, and as it stands, this is my altar for now.

[Picture 2](http://i.imgur.com/PmhtuXzh.jpg)

[Picture 3](http://i.imgur.com/qkL0HbHh.jpg)

In Picture 1, you can see that the paint worked out very well as a chalk board. I think I applied about six very light coats, as each coat dried in maybe thirty seconds.

If you look at the tabletop in Picture 2, you can see that it is quite warped.

As you can see in picture 3, one leg is shorter than another.

When I can manage to find the time to, I'm going to get something to put under the one leg to make it as long as the other, and get a sturdy foundation. I'm also going to need to get a few beams for the legs to hopefully counteract the warping, and help further balance the altar. So far it has been a learning experience, and the only two things to go right are the paint, and the height. It's perfectly at hand level for me. I'll stop back again when I get it fixed up.

**TL;DR**: Shit got kind of fucked up, but not too fucked up that I can't fix it.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,1367566055.0,,,True,t3_1di9zn,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1di9zn/constructing_an_altar/,

Anyone have information on this?,Zachattck93,16,1,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1bjvay/i_found_a_strange_book_at_a_college_campus_book/,"[Illumination on Jacob Boehme](http://imgur.com/ZVbsw0y). The page with the diagram is in the front of the book before the quotation. In case you can't see the symbols, they're very similar to [the ones within this ouroboros](http://drakonig.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/alchemy2.jpg). I'm very interested in other cultures and belief systems so seemingly occult and esoteric things like this are fun for me to take a look at. The day I saw it I took some pictures, and when I got home from class I did some research on the book and author(s). I found it was related to some kind of Christian mysticism or alchemy, and the diagram in the above picture was apparently from [page 666 of the Paradoxa Emblemata](http://forum.alchemyforums.com/archive/index.php/t-123.html). (ctrl+f, ""unwise"" or ""666""). 

I went back the next day to see if the book was still there. It was, so I bought it because of my intrigue. Doing a google image search on ""Jacob Boehme"" or ""Paradoxa Emblemata"" turns up some strange diagrams and pictures, some with short and mysterious statements like [""From whence is this and that, if not of the Center?""](http://images.unurthed.com/From-whence-Freher-71.jpg) and [""It is finished when Seven are One.""](http://www.nachtkabaret.com/ihvh/img/nk_it_is_finished.jpg)

I had posted this to /r/alchemy, but it was suggested that I repost it here. If anyone here could tell me more about the book, the Paradoxa Emblemata, Jacob Boehme, Dionysius Andreas Freher, or alchemy/mysticsm in general, I'd appreciate any information. 

I'm completely new to all this, but as an outsider looking in, alchemy appears to be a pseudoscience. I'm not trying to be converted to being a practitioner of alchemy, but I'd like to try to understand, or at least gain some knowledge on the beliefs and practices of other peoples. Therefore, I am open to attempting to understand, but not so much as to agree with everything I hear. 

I've never met another person who is knowledgeable of these things, (at least openly) so I'm lucky to be able to use the internet to reach out to the diverse world of humanity.

Edit: I'm seeing a lot of the [Venus symbol](http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSqj_d7f_aAn_8SXLDGn3F-pXF0dlmPI1PCJ7Lc4ZspNfGSFLhE), and I know that Venus represents the ""morning star"", which is another name for Satan.

&gt;Within  the individual personality, the Higher Self, or mystic fool, forever pokes fun at the worldly goals and methods of the lower ego and prods it to turn from the ways of the blind fool to those of the wise fool. From ancient days in our culture April 1 has been known as All Fool's Day. This day is placed in the spring, at the end of the six month cycle of incarnational folly that began in autumn. The time period between the equinox of autumn and that of spring was regarded as the dark or nether half of the year when the earth is dead, the days short and the night of expectation long. The fool journeys forth into the lower worlds of earthly darkness for one half of the year, while the other half he spends in the bright sunshine of the divine worlds. 

&gt; The lower branches of the Tree of Life, past the middle point of the beauty of Tiphareth, are enveloped in relative darkness; the higher we climb on the branches, however the brighter and sunnier the world becomes. Thus the lower five sephiroth stand for the dark cycle of the year while the upper five may be symbolized by the sunny six months of spring and summer. In the springtime the Fool awakens from his aeonial slumber within the tomblike confines of material attachments and walks into the sunlight of spiritual initiation leading to  Divine Union.

&gt; It is on All Fool's Day that the adherents of certain ancient mysteries celebrated this event, when man ceases to be the blind fool of earth and becomes the wise fool of heaven.

Being new I didn't really know what to say in response other than it's a matter of willpower to which they went off on saying that it is all just chemicals in the brain and all that and nothing more. I probably should have left the conversation sooner than I did because I was getting quite angry with them which was probably tickling them in the way they want to be tickled.

They left me really questioning it and honestly kind of saddening me since I haven't really found any way to prove to myself that magick is real. I don't care if I can't prove it to them, that's not what this is about.

Edit: I just remembered this and I thought I would bring it up. I guess it is relevant.

I have had some magical experiences before involving the weather that still perplex me today. A good friend of mine who is a black belt in an experimental martial art (only taught at one dojo and was created by the Sensei there) told me that it's all about willpower. You can make things change if you will it so. We were both going to work one day and we saw huge rain clouds in the air. Since we were working outside that day we were kinda bummed about the rain. I said to him, remembering what he told me about will, that it was not going to rain. It will not rain I said, and he said the same things. We kinda brought it up to each other throughout the day saying it will not rain and all that and lo and behold the rain cloud passed and we only realized it after the day was done.

I experimented with the same thing on a few occasions on my own. Saying it will not rain etc when I was going to go out on a day with a dark cloud in the sky and it worked. On two occasions I made it rain and both were while I was on the highway to another city. Saying to myself that it will rain when I arrive or that it will drizzle at 2 am and my predictions were always right.

I still don't know if it was me tapping into the weather patterns or if it was my will, my friend thinks it was a bit of both but maybe some of you could clear this up for me.

I don't want a cartoon pony, a girl friend or a furry for a Tulpa. I'm not looking for companionship in the imaginary realm, and certainly not one that'd be talking in my head or talking through me without the ability of getting rid of it, what I am after is self-discovery. Having read somewhat about what a Tulpa is I realized that its use was even utilized in Heremtic Magick and other forms of occultism, but I'm not really interested in blood rituals either.

I have real time projected twice in the past, and managed to vibrate up to what I believe was the mental plane or at least the upper reaches of the astral at least once.  This was before my habit became particularly bad.  I also have modest astral vision (can see auras in a dimly lit room or with the help of crystals like lepidolite or lapis, have observed my own thought forms on my pictureplane several times) and excel at crude energy work for someone without a mentor or school (mainly psiballs with temperature or color, some shielding, a few kundalini awakenings that ended in institutionalization, and one badly behaved but efficacious servitor who i sincerely hope has died off by now). 

In my experience a cigarette definitely shuts down my third eye for a good 5-10 minutes, and I've noticed lately, since my habit has picked up (somewhere between a half/whole pack a day) distinct trouble working with my breath; *namely when I slow my breathing past a certain point my heart starts racing to make up for the poor blood oxygenation.*  

*Can any among you recommend a technique, visualization or some kind of self hypnosis to help dissociate from my meat suit that works with something other than breath?*  Since I settled for suicide on the installment plan, my only luck in reaching the hypnagogic state has been dream triggers that bring back my awareness of the physical plane from the etheric vantage point, but, woe betide me, I either haven't had the sheer energy reserves, or the capacity to harness them, to resonate out of the ether and actually reach the astral.

In Man and His Bodies, Besant talks about how meat, tobacco and narcotics pollute the aura with astral contaminants concomitant to the physical toxins associated with them, and while admitting that it is possible to power through the hindrances, insists it's not worth it, karmically, in the long run.  I tend to agree, but can anyone recommend a temporary workaround?  Or is my only real option to quit?

NB I have a distinctly Jewish physiology (prone to anxiety symptoms, indigestion and dehydration), which might explain the difference between myself and my more Hyperborean associates who smoke like chimneys and find their third eye even tends to open as a result.

My knowledge of the occult and demonology is basically non-existent and I am coming at this from a very non-spiritual place. I am proceeding according to certain assumptions. Demons are not in fact real entities but personifications and manifestations of our fears, desires, and impulses which through socially determined moral constructs are deemed negative in nature, bad or even evil.

1354421711.0,12,self.occult,144xg6,Astral Projection Question -- tried /r/astralprojection to no avail,,14,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/144xg6/astral_projection_question_tried/,"I posted this a while ago in /r/astralprojection but that sub seems dead, and from what I've read in /r/occult there are a lot of knowledgeable people who might be able to offer some good advice.

 first tried astral projection/lucid dreaming when I was 13-16, I can't really remember. I had read Siddhartha by Herman Hesse and was blown away. I read more and more about spirituality and eventually stumbled upon binaural beats. The first preset I used for astral projection seemed to work, too well for someone as new to the concept as I was. My body felt as if it was vibrating at an incredible rate, like a jackhammer, and I slowly felt like I was being pulled up. I freaked out and moved, pulled the headphones out. My pulse was racing.

I had a few other experiences I'll gloss over to get to my most recent one, today. Long story short, I sort of put my spiritual endeavors on the side and life sidetracked me. The past week I've read a little more, and had a strange feeling of needing to get back into it. I'm not sure why. Just a feeling of getting drawn back into it...

I woke up this morning, and after about two hours I felt like laying down and giving it a try. I've listened to a few of the Hemi-Sync tapes and the long method, the steps and the process, it all seemed too complicated to me. I never followed a meditation technique or anything of the sort regularly.

I lay down. My mind is always racing with thoughts(diagnosed ADD), so I lay there and try to think spiritual thoughts, but of course I get distracted, so I just let it drift, I try to think less and less. Whenever I begin to vocalize my thoughts in my head or actively think, if that makes sense, I feel myself slip away from the state I want to achieve. Eventually I get to a point where I notice my thoughts are getting pretty nonsensical, and they take on more of a day-dream type nature. Scenes, people, places, scenarios, etc, drift around I just don't focus on it. I don't move, and try to feel my body relaxing and falling asleep, let my brain do its thing and just try to keep that ""observer"" part of my consciousness awake. This morning, I don't know if I actually fell asleep for a short time or if I just went deeper/more relaxed than ever before, but I sort of ""woke"" to the beginning of the vibrations. It was a very dreamy, very relaxed state; it's strange to feel how relaxed your body is but feels as if its beginning to move. As the vibrations got stronger I would have thoughts about not moving, or try to focus on the vibrations, and they start to go away, so I just kept trying to let it happen and stay relaxed. Some strange images ran through my head; the semi-naked ghost from 13 Ghosts, my (recent) ex, etc, and I worried about what I would find or see when I managed to project. I tried not to think about it. The vibrations continued and finally I had this moment where I realized ""Oh shit, here it comes...""

The vibrations were incredible, it is really an unbelievable feeling. There was a whooshing, loud sort of sound, not quite sure how to describe it? My room was dark but I saw light, as if the whole room was lit up with a yellowish/white glow. And I freaked out, decided to stop and I tried moving.

I couldn't move at first. The light faded away rapidly and at the corner of my visions I saw objects of some sort I couldn't identify as they were gone as quickly as they had came. I tried moving for a few seconds, as my eyes readjusted to the dark room, and finally managed to move my arms and laid up in bed looking around.

Some people spend so much time trying to AP, learn so many complex methods, and go through so much just to experience it. I have't tried at all in years, I'm 24, and it seems to come easily when I try. I've wanted to have a spiritual experience my entire life; to have some sort of experience with another world, to know there is more to life. I come so close and my fear holds me back.

I'm fearful of finding something, or someone, dark and malevolent. I have no real spiritual beliefs, and I'm not one for prayer really; my spiritual interests have been in the occult. Thelema, Chaos, Kabbalah, some Eastern/Indian ideologies.

What should I do? I have no idea what to expect when I do AP, what I'll find or what I'll run into. I'm afraid something horrible would happen, end up insane or in a coma or something. How do I best these fears?

About art. And psychiatry. They're both self-perpetuating systems. Like religion. All three of them promise you a sense of inner worth and meaning, and spend a lot of time telling you about the suffering you have to go through to achieve it. As soon as you get a problem in any one of them, the solution it gives is always to go deeper into the same system. They're all in rather uneasy truce with one another in what's actually a mortal battle. Like all self-reinforcing systems. At best, each is trying to encompass the other two and define them as sub-groups. You know: religion and art are both forms of madness and madness is the realm of psychiatry. Or, art is the study and praise of man and man's ideals, so therefore a religious experience just becomes a brutalized aesthetic response and psychiatry is just another tool for the artist to observe man and render his portraits more accurately. And the religious attitude I guess is that the other two are only useful as long as they promote the good life. At worst, they all try to destroy one another. Which is what my psychiatrist, whether he knew it or not, was trying, quite effectively, to do to my painting. I gave up psychiatry too, pretty soon. I just didn't want to get all wound up in any systems at all.”

When I was a kid, by which I mean I was eight or nine years old, my mother said she wanted to show me something. She explained to me that her mother showed her something similar when she was young and that she wanted me to have something to hold onto when I grew older and found myself doubting more and more often. 
So she took me outside and had me lay on the yard with her and look up into the clear blue sky. The completely clear blue sky. 
(Now before I continue let me say that for as far as I know there was nothing reported on the news channel for any heavy weather to come up)
Now mom said watch the sky, she pointed up and just kinda swirled her finger in a spiral while pointing at the sky. After a few minutes (anywhere between five to ten I think) clouds started to appear and slowly moved overhead. (so far this can all be accounted for just regular weather, I know. Hold on for a sec ya skeptics :P) 
The clouds then followed the swirl of her finger, moving in a pretty big circular motion over the house. She also asked for thunder and, well, there was thunder. 
Idk, it was pretty awesome. Sure I was a kid, and I am a bit more of a skeptic nowadays then I used to be when I was a kid. But I really cant just dismiss what she said and what I saw happen. A. Its my mother, I really cant call her a liar, ya know? And B. It seemed pretty legit to me, even still.

The sidebar kind of bothers me

&gt;A sub-reddit for those who are interested in pursing enlightenment through gnosis (direct spiritual experiential knowledge and intuitive knowledge, mystic rather than that from rational or reasoned thinking).

Isn't all thinking rational? To me it sounds like it's saying to people who're seeking meaning to their own interpretations and practices. There's a reality out there, a thing we exist in. Some people may chose to have abstract hypothetical ritualistic tools and practice to handle or view that reality. 

Which is a round-a-bout way of saying people indulge in such things like tarot cards or i-ching to find answers from the universe. I am suggesting that this method is that *their own interpretations and practice*. 

On that assumption there's two points to consider:

* All of these interpretations and practices have no intrinsic value. They're used only internally, so for example having a necklace on a chain and asking it questions, my subconscious will answer for me by real and proven subtle movements in my hands. That's great as it provides real value but only in the scope of an internal system. For example it shouldn't be done to predict something external such as a natural disaster or something about someone else.

* The other point is something outrageous but rational. Hypothetically, but logically, higher abstract dimensions can be put in place to describe the un-intractable parts of reality. Such as, we live in a reality mostly where time is two dimensional, our space is three dimensional. A different view of the same object (a persons lifeline) could show it as time as 1 dimension being the whole journey taken as one object. We cant imagine this object, but we can imagine a placeholder for it. We can then say this object represents a person life, but we can know more. Having this object doesn't give any insight into the decisions that person might have made and could have made. So, we could imagine infinite timelines all going off where the person made different decisions and choices. Treating all of these as one object, we can say we know all the information there is to know about this person and all outcomes to their choices. But we can still know more, each person is born with initial conditions such as genes and circumstance. If we imagine all the different possible genetics and circumstances this person could be born with, all of the decisions they made or paths they could take and all the subsequent timelines these provide - and treat it all as one object. We know everything about this person, but it's not that person anymore, it's a genric object. It stopped being that person asoon as we abstracted and looked at the different decisions they *could* have made. And if you apply the same dimensional assumptions to any object they fit. This is a system theory model to describe the universe. What's interesting to speculate is that this is all there is. In doing so we say that nothing could possibly exist outside of this object as this object facilitates every possible thing that could ever be. [[further thoughts]](http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/g7idq/question_how_do_extraterrestrials_view_god/c1liire)

Under the assumption of the second point, which basically describes singularity, oneness, god, whatever you want to call it. You can imagine - and very possibly that we can do real magic and real feats of impossibility easily. We do so by climbing the ladder of dimensions, extracting or viewing the information and crawling back down to the lower dimensions where you find your lifeline and use that information (for examaple, going into the object that stores all decisions of all people and seeing someone's future, then climbing back down to your lifeline and keeping that information on that person) . The problem is, the moment you climb dimensions your experience changes from your individualism, you're now something else which is shared with everything else. Here your motives for magic or whatever intention **you** had doesn't exist as it did then. It's now a whisper in a infinite sea of whispers, with no significance to the vessel you're currently attaining to be here, only to that one lifeline you represent. There's a vast amount of references to humans not being able to fully comprehend or experience the presence of god, heaven, the ultimate truth - etc. I argue that this is why. 

So, hypothetically magic and unreal abilities do exist in a rational sense. Though paradoxical as they're described as impossible to do because the individual has these intentions but cannot bring those intentions to another layer. What's important to note is you're always in these higher dimensions and awareness - always. But you just don't feel these levels as you're in your current vessel. So in this way we can say that all things we cant to happen, do, but they don't always translate into what the individual us, thinks they wanted. Also, there's no way of knowing if it happens or not, as an individual perspective. This is all probably very true and superficial for you all. But I wanted to type it anyway.

I propose that through meditation and narrowing/expanding the awareness it's worth exploring the boundaries of how far you can force your *this, individual* conciousness up the ladder. When I force try during meditation I get such euphoric ecstasy in human sensations but I feel I hit a barrier where if I go further I'll die [[further thoughts]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/sriur/questions_on_my_last_experience/). This somewhat supports the theory - to me. So when we talk about enlightenment maybe it's not attaining it, perhaps it's knowing we're enlightened and that this individualistic life is one of the infinate legs that enlightenment stands on. Maybe to individually be enlightened our life needs to reflect the above. The term as above so below has new meaning here. If we hypothetically place and occupy these dimensions in our own mind, and reflecting above, perhaps that's the most efficient way to become enlightened. But alas this experience of mine could be nothing more than the first point, and what is the difference. It just might be *my* own interpretations and practice.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,1337206914.0,,,True,t3_tpt1y,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/tpt1y/systems_theory/,

I've been reading about various bits of occultism (specifically Chaos Magic and a really tiny bit of Qabbalah, sorry if that's not what you're into here,) and I'm finding it very interesting, and it sort of makes sense to me. At first I was skeptical, almost hostile to it coming from a proof-demanding sort of mindset, then I became aware that materialism is a belief based on faith like everything else, and I'm more open to the possibility of the supernatural, but I still can't shake the idea that results have to be provable, repeatable,quantifiable to count. I've read the post about burden of proof, but I'm still struggling with the dogma and doctrine of faith in materialism (although I think coming to see it as dogma and faith is a positive step.)

Sorry if I rambled a bit.

Any thoughts?

**Edit**: There seems to be some confusion about what I mean when I refer to materialism. I'm not talknig about attachment to material goods or money.

I have noticed a myriad of subjects overlapping in my studies. After reading *Cosmic Trigger* last week -- my first R.A.Wilson book -- I have a better understanding of how ""the UFO angle"" fits into the occult schema. I also have seen an awful lot of parallels with psychedelic studies, especially in areas like shamanism, and *Cosmic Trigger* touches on this heavily too.

Wilson's work also deals with conspiracy theories on a wide range of issues. Looking up occult or new age literature, I more frequently notice an overlap with the conspiracy crowd.

But all this conspiracy, along with which I perceive (maybe wrongly assume?) an attitude of victimization, helplessness, and distress on the part of the believer...what function does it serve? What is its relevancy? What is the appeal? Within society (predominantly counter-culture), maybe it is a psychological caricaturization/exaggeration of the actual state of affairs, so that by the time the essence of the idea is diluted into the mainstream, the average Joe is left with this inexplicable bad taste in his mouth regarding authority/secrecy...?

If we are all projecting from within, creating, co-creating, telling myths...I dunno, I guess it seems like an awful lot of energy to put into telling such disheartening stories. I'm in agreement with Alan Moore on the subject regarding conspiracy -- the truth of the matter might seem far scarier (but for me, freeing): no one is in control.

I'm a 22yo American facing some 'big life decisions' (college?, career?, family?, etc.). I'm considering things in as wide a range as: joining an eco-commune, staying at a monastery indefinitely, learning a trade and saving money, getting a middle-class career in programming, becoming an academic philosopher, moving to Denmark, staying single/polyamorous, getting married/having a family, saving enough money to invest so that I don't have to work, becoming a radical political activist, etc. I'm contemplating the various directions I could go in life and things I want at this point in my future.

I'm not asking for anyone to answer these questions for me, that's a task for myself. But it got me thinking, and I'm interested in how you occultists approached answering these questions when you were younger or are approaching them (if you're my age).

As for me, so far, I've noticed a number of conflicts that I need to resolve. On the one hand, I want to retreat to my books and practices. I want to develop as a person and spiritually. I want to talk with, learn from, and teach like-minded people. On the other hand, I want to change this world. There are so many people casting dark spells of advertising, poor education, political propaganda, etc. that I'd like to see more light spells being cast, so to speak. Pushing out positive philosophy, literature, art, and countercultural propaganda. On the other other hand, I seek financial security. While working a part-time job is great for my free time (so great), I'm perpetually living paycheck to paycheck and would rather be in a less precarious place. However, opposed to that, more money means a career that will require my time even at home and that would eat away heavily at my free time which is most important. Obviously, some inner conflicts need resolution.

Money (i.e. resources) v. Free time. Inner world work v. Outer world work. Pleasure and fun v. Prudence and long-term goals.

Anyway, how have you dealt with this. How do you balance living in the material world and living in the occult world?

Is there anything about where our world is going that you have taken into account that might be worth considering?

&gt; The ultimate postmodern irony of today is the strange exchange between Europe and Asia: at the very moment when ""European"" technology and capitalism are triumphing worldwide at the level of the ""economic infrastructure, the Judeo-Christian legacy is threatened at the level of ""ideological superstructure"" in the European space itself by New Age ""Asiatic"" thought, which, in its different guises ranging from ""Western Buddhism"" to different ""Taos,"" is establishing itself as the hegemonic ideology of global capitalism. Therein resides the highest speculative identity of opposites in today's global civilization: although ""Western Buddhism"" presents itself as the remedy against the stressful tension of capitalist dynamics, allowing us to uncouple and retain inner peace and Gelassenheit, it actually functions as its perfect ideological supplement. One should mention here the well-known concept of ""future shock"" that describes how people are no longer psychologically able to cope with the dazzling rhythm of technological development and the social changes that accompany it. Things simply move too fast, and before one can accustom oneself to an invention, it has already been supplanted by a new one, so that one more and more lacks the most elementary ""cognitive mapping."" The recourse to Taoism or Buddhism offers a way out of this predicament that definitely works better than the desperate escape into old traditions. Instead of trying to cope with the accelerating rhythm of techno-logical progress and social changes, one should rather renounce the very endeavor to retain control over what goes on, rejecting it as the expression of the modern logic of domination. One should, instead, ""let oneself go,"" drift along, while retaining an inner distance and indifference toward the mad dance of accelerated process, a distance based on the insight that all this social and technological upheaval is ultimately just a non-substantial proliferation of semblances that do not really concern the innermost kernel of our being. One is almost tempted to resuscitate the old infamous Marxist cliché of religion as the ""opium of the people,"" as the imaginary supplement to terrestrial misery. The ""Western Buddhist"" meditative stance is arguably the most efficient way for us to fully participate in capitalist dynamics while retaining the appearance of mental sanity. If Max Weber were alive today, he would definitely write a second, supplementary, volume to his Protestant Ethic, entitled The Taoist Ethic and the Spirit of Global Capitalism.

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life. I just get up every day and do it. It's the weirdest fucking thing ever. What do we have to look forward to? Why does everyone around me seem so calm? Can't they feel this? Are they all just as neurotic as I am, and suppress it just long enough to talk about Weezer and craft beer and board games and common core state standards and oddly shaped PC cases and screen resolution and remote control helicopters

I want to **thrive**, you know?

Is all this aforementioned tripe just the stuff that gets printed on this ticker tape that endlessly comes out of my ears, because I've got my radio tuned to 94.3 when I should try to tune it to 107.9?

It was 6:34. Then it was 7:23. Now it's 8:28 PM. It's going to keep on doing that, isn't it? Why? For how long?

**TL;DR** Feels like I am slipping a little bit, I don't know quite what else to say or who to say it to. My head is everywhere. Feels good to write. I'm going to go watch this French romantic comedy I just downloaded called *The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie*, and drink some wine, I suppose. I am grateful I can at least enjoy these luxuries. Grateful to have a PC and a working keyboard. Grateful to have a job. Ugh. Maybe my imagination is powerful enough that I am very realistically concocting this tunnel of hopelessness. Maybe I should have another cup of coffee. Maybe I should lay off the coffee for a while.

A reversal of The Sun. Things...seem wrong but are in actuality okay? I wrote down once ""Things always seem approximately 66.6% worse than they actually are."" I write down so many things. When I clean my apartment, the pages and scribbles pile up something frightening. Anti-anxiety meds for a few months last year. HATED them. Nausea and compulsive yawning and shaking hands.

I have the capacity to put myself through such nightmarish mental states. I feel very out of touch. Don't know which cult to join. Great health. Great shape. Steady work. Summertime. New habits. Yes or No questions. Car insurance. Organic produce. Fluoride in the water. So many sedentary family members. ""No, I've never seen 'Ace of Cakes'. Have you ever thought about why zero equals two?""

""The monotony and solitude of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind."" Albert Einstein. Global disarmament. A handful of mormon gun-toting relatives, and I wonder about the probability of bloody slaughter in a sudden civil war. What ideologies, what factions, what political persuasions pitted against one another? In this world, there's two kinds of people, my friend: those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig?

I just discovered this sub today and thought I should introduce myself. 

I started studying Western Esotericism at a very young age. I had found Tyson's Modern Magick in my local library by 13. By 15 I was onto Regardrie and after 16 I was heavily influenced by Crowley and Carroll. 

I spent some time in the OTO between 18 and 21, but I never formally initiated into first degree. I took that decision to go forward very very seriously and after my time with the order I decided that it just wasn't going to be for me. 

I'm formally a Buddhist now, and have been for a few years. I don't formally identify myself as a Western Esotericist much anymore, despite some fairly conspicuous tattoos. I've discovered recently that Western Esotericism, and Hermeticism in particular, is a language I will never not speak, it has left indelible marks within me.

I'm in my early 30's and it's been awhile, so I thought I'd start checking things out again, see what the state of things are like now. I am actually kind of interested in your online Hermeticism experiment, but I'm a bit leery as well, for now I will consider it. 

I don't know how much I'll be around, but I thought I'd say hello. I'm not going to be one of those arse hats that sweep in from the street and announce loudly that they are masters here to answer any and all of your questions and vomit unsolicited advice at every turn. However, if you have any questions or I can help clarify things, let me know. I have studied a lot of Esotericism in an Academic setting, I actually speak Hebrew (albeit Modern), and I've a very long and pronounced familiarity with the Kabbalah. 

But as I said, I'm a Buddhist now, I wouldn't take advice or information from me.

We asked if Jude was a friend, and Emily said yes. The notes are at the bottom, 'cause we aren't sure of some things.

All 3 of us had gotten incredibly itchy. My partner and I started feeling itchy on our arms, necks, and heads. My partner's sister's legs got really itchy. My partner's sister and I suddenly got extremely frustrated. It made it difficult to focus on the session. My partner was the designated speaker, and I was finding myself annoyed with their every move for no reason at all. My frustration was hard to tell when it started since it was a very slow build-up. My partner's sister also got an overwhelming desire to clap around the time that we asked what Emily wanted.

Anyway, we asked Emily if communicating through the talking board was the reason we were all so itchy; the answer was yes. After that, there were a lot of overwhelming emotions going about, so we told Emily we would contact them later and needed to engage in some self-care.

Beating Back The Crocodile

[pg 028]

[From Lepsius, “Todtenbuch,” Bll. 16 and 17.]

&gt; The Chapter of beating back the Crocodile that cometh to carry away the magical words from the Khu in the underworld. Osiris Auf-ānkh, triumphant, saith:

&gt; “The Mighty One fell down upon the place where he is, or (as others say), upon his belly, but the company of the gods caught him and set him up again. [My] soul cometh and it speaketh with its father, and the Mighty One delivereth it from these eight31 crocodiles. I know them by their names and [what] they live upon, and I am he who hath delivered his father from them.”

&gt; “Get thee back, O Crocodile that dwellest in the West, thou that livest upon the stars which never rest, for that which is an abomination unto thee is in my belly, O thou that hast eaten the forehead of Osiris. I am Set.”

&gt; “Get thee back, O Crocodile that dwellest in the West, for the serpent-fiend Nāau is in my belly, and I will give him unto thee; let not thy flame be against me.”

&gt; “Get thee back, O Crocodile that dwellest in the East, who feedest upon those who eat their own filth, for that which is an abomination unto thee is in my belly; I advance, I am Osiris.”

&gt; “Get thee back, O Crocodile that dwellest in the East, the serpent-fiend Nāau is in my belly, and I will give [him] unto thee; let not thy flame be against me.”

&gt; “Get thee back, O Crocodile that dwellest in the South, who feedest upon filth, and waste, and dirt, for that which is an abomination unto thee is in my belly; shall not the flame be on thy hand? I am Sept.”

&gt; “Get thee back, O Crocodile that dwellest in the South, for I am safe by reason of my charm; my fist is among the flowers and I will not give it unto thee.”

&gt; “Get thee back, O Crocodile that dwellest in the North, who feedest upon what is offered(?) within the hours, for that which thou abominatest is in my belly; let [not] thy venom be upon my head, for I am Tem.”

&gt; “Get thee back, O Crocodile that dwellest in the North, for the goddess Serqet is in my belly and I have not yet brought her forth. I am Uatch-Maati (or Merti).”

&gt; “The things which are created are in the hollow of my hand, and those which have not yet come into being are in my body. I am clothed and wholly provided with thy magical words, O Rā, the which are in heaven above me and in the earth beneath me. I have gained power, and exaltation, and a full-breathing throat in the abode of my father Ur (i.e., the Mighty One), and he hath delivered unto me the beautiful Amentet which destroyeth living men and women; but strong is its divine lord, who suffereth from weakness,” or (as others say) “exhaustion twofold, therein day by day. My face is open, my heart is upon its seat, and the crown with the serpent is upon me day by day. I am Rā, who is his own protector, and nothing shall ever cast me to the ground.”

Psychological tolerance is the tolerance of the inconceivability of all phenomena.  Tolerance means to be at peace with.  Inconceivability means weird.  So in short, it means to be at peace with the weird.

To that end there is a great practice I want to recommend.  It so happens that many of us have experienced a very terrifying moment.  For example, one time I dreamt I discovered my face on a shelf in the bathroom, and when I looked in the mirror, I had no head.  I was existentially and utterly terrified.  I've had many moments like this.  Another example would be having my seemingly human dream body stretch into what seemed like infinite space, and the scale of infinity would then cause terror in me.  These kinds of moments are very important in an occult practice and they are not to be thrown away and forgotten.  These moments of terror are the great treasures on the path!

The actual practice consists of relaxing and entering a meditative mood.  Once there, vividly bring to mind the moment of terror.  Try to recall it as best as you can.  Then visualize that moment of terror as a meditational deity.  Beautify it with your chosen symbols, such as the letter or letters of God, your totem, a symbolically important color, a rainbow, a mirror, a peacock feather, a pair of wings, or something else that conveys sacredness and transcendence on your path.  Then mentally bow to your Terror deity or totem.  Mentally accept it as your teacher, a worthy companion and a true friend who doesn't lie.  Then mentally dissolve this vision of the meditational Terror deity inside your body and being.  As you do so, make sure you assiduously dissolve all the vivid recollections of the terror you've experienced into your body and being.

You should strive to feel a mixture of terror just as you remember it (to the extent it continues to terrify you), as vividly as possible, reverence, compassion, kindness, and peace of being utterly inseparable and on great terms with that terror.

Conclude by peaceful meditation or peaceful contemplation.

Doing this regularly will help develop psychic tolerance of the inconceivable.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,False,,,True,t3_1c6qh0,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1c6qh0/terror_as_the_teacher_and_a_precious_companion/,

As I'm leaving work, the only remaining coworker looks at me and yells, apropos of nothing: ""Don't kill yourself!"" I froze in place, and asked him to repeat himself. ""Don't kill yourself! You look sick, so don't worry about coming in early tomorrow to make up the hours. Your health comes first, you know, so don't kill yourself."" He has no idea about my awful experience, and never uses that phrase. He's also very shy and hard to hear, but he yelled the words at me. It was totally out of character. I don't know quite how to explain it, but when he said those words it was like the universe was speaking to me, telling me not to let my depression get the best of me. I could just feel it, like the words communicated a hidden message just to me through my coworker as a medium. Is this what magickal coincidences and synchronicities are like? It was so surreal. 

FYI: I'm not suicidal, just really depressed atm. I could see my current depression getting out of hand, but this experience stopped that from happening. ",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,False,,,True,t3_1akhuc,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1akhuc/im_wondering_what_to_make_of_this/,

About ten years ago I was moving into my new apartment. The apartment itself was at least 70-100 years old and was two bedrooms. The second bedroom was the most peculiar design I've ever seen (I work in a construction trade). As soon as you walked in the door if you turned to the right there was the second bedroom. This small 8x8 ""bedroom"" that just had a weird vibe every time you either looked in it or stepped inside.

I was moving some stuff in one night when I started feeling like I was being watched. From the master bedroom you could see through the kitchen, living room and finally into that creepy second bedroom. I walked out into the kitchen because the feeling was so intense and what I saw next I will never forget. There before me stood a man in a straight jacket with the most piercing brown eyes and the most fucked up devilish grin you can imagine. I was paralyzed in fear for three seconds before bolting out the door and speeding away in my car.

I thought I was going crazy as would most people. So I brought my friend over that same night and didn't say ANYTHING about the incident. Just told him to come check out my new place. I was in my bedroom setting up stuff when I hear him scream from the living room in absolute terror. I instantly knew what he saw, and asked him ""did you see it, did you see it?!"". 

He shouts yes and we both run like madmen. In the car I get the same description from him without me giving him any details of what I saw so I could verify I wasn't crazy. He saw the same exact guy I saw.

We decide to bring his brother over under the same guise I had told him. We said nothing of what we saw. The brother enters. Without saying a word he goes into the creepy bedroom, goes into the corner and starts holding his arms like a straight jacket going ""aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah"". 

He was joking. We freaked out and asked him why he did that and he replied. ""Seems like a room a guy would be in a straight jacket"".

1359481282.0,13,self.occult,17i7to,I wonder if I am in over my head and what I have thrown down the gauntlet to.,norcalNeoHippy,19,6,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/17i7to/i_wonder_if_i_am_in_over_my_head_and_what_i_have/,"This is where I start to sound crazy in my own ears, but I think I have a challenge ahead of me.

I have in my protection a staggeringly powerful soul, but one that is nieve and defenseless. She is beset by what I can only describe as parasitic or vampyric (I use this term not to describe a ""vampire"", but to describe the behavior) forces that feed on what she has and leave her afraid and alone and empty. She has very little concept of what is going on. She refers to her troubles half satirically as a ""gypsy curse"".

Last night I was able to wrangle some of it out of her. Or a part of it. It wasn't too tricky, whatever it is does not seem very smart. It is attracted to light so can be drawn out and then drowned with what I can only label as ""tao mind"". It can't get purchase on any significant part of me because of that - its like its trying to bite a wall. It can be bait and switched and then latch where it cannot draw anything and then it is confounded. Somewhat like a tick that has burrowed into a callus and can then be pinched off once its head is stuck and cannot draw blood. Clumsy analogy, but its what feels accurate.

While doing this I saw an aspect of it. There are wolf eyes, yellow. There are concentric teeth. There is a maggot aspect. It is a parasite. It believes it is frightening and is affronted when you tell it to go fuck itself. Which I did. I told it that it could not touch her anymore and I set a ward around her. It has to get through me first.

There is a hand shape that it responds to that when I make it, it reaches out and starts climbing up my arm in little black tendrils. My left hand. I am left handed. It is somewhat like offering it a handshake that it then has a hard time letting go of. It is no threat if you present it mind hard like obsideon but aimless as the wafting gale. The more I let it climb on to me the more viscously I can yank on it and tear at it. While skirmishing with it and drawing it out and onto me I found that I could get it to commit a large amount of energy to latching me. Furthermore I found that by merging my mind with a specific ""frequency"" and dipping into samadhi I disappear to it. Pushing out from there I could rend it with clean energy (which since I'm a bloody hippie I call prana).

Maybe I am lulled into a false sense of security. Do you know what kind of nastie I am dealing with? Might it be ""smarter"" or ""trickier"" than I think? I know nothing of the etheric uglies. I'm not on a crusade, I don't give a fuck, everything has its place. This fuckers place is just not molesting this woman. I am not really angry at it but have only indignation at the unfairness of how it is parasitizing the vulnerable. If it wants to play that game its gonna get fucked over my dead body if need be.

I am simple and guileless. The dark has nothing that tempts me. The energy I pull is clean and warm. I think that is why I can let it grab me and then play teflon. Or maybe I'm batshit insane.

I am mainly ignorant of the occult. I have read some crowley and some basics about psi forms, but my understanding of the etheric is from a reiki/kundalini/chakra perspective. Like I said, dirty hippie of the left hand.

I had never before cast any kind of serious ward, but I did last night. At the peak of my indignation at the unjustness of the situation I was filled with energy and formed it as a blanket covering the woman in question. I directed it to be impermeable to all ""vampyric and parasitic forces"". I directed it to last ""as long as needed"" and to draw all necessary energy from me at any time. I felt the need to define where to energy would come from and indicated my heart chakra. I did this by intuition. I am not sure what I may have signed myself up for with that. Furthermore there was a intent that ""anything trying to get to her has to get past me first"". There was also a merciless, incendiary tone directed at anything shunted my way via this channel.

I have many questions, but I suspect that anyone who has information to offer will know what I need to know and that is more valuable than whatever I think to ask. I wonder what I might be dealing with. I wonder if it is craftier than I suppose. I wonder what affect if any my ""ward"" is likely to have. I wonder if my ""fuck you, you slimy piece of filth"" and ""bring it on you don't' scare me"" attitude is over-confident. I wonder if things that feed like this are attracted to places and people who throw around large amount of ""warm"" energy (among other things, some of our sexual practices are splashy and ""loud"" energetically speaking). I wonder if there is anything I can do to keep such parasites out of my house.

That same day I had been reading Macbeth where Hecate is mentioned and then a third time in a poem I had read the week before.

I called this a 'coincidence' but on the advice of this witch I now call all such coincidences acts of 'serendipity' and write them down in my notebook.

I have a real great example of serendipity to write down.

Yesterday I was arguing with my girlfriend about the lyrics to 'windmills of your mind' and if they were used on a TV advert. I didn't really know the rest of the lyrics...

Today we were playing Trivial Pursuit (the board game where you go around the wheel answering trivia) and there were two questions on ""The Windmills of Your Mind"". 

We finished the game and switched on the TV. Behold, a comedy sketch with the same song being played in the background.

I googled the lyrics:

&gt;""Round like a circle in a spiral
&gt;
&gt;Like a wheel within a wheel
&gt;
&gt;Never ending on beginning
&gt;
&gt;On an ever-spinning reel.""
&gt;

Now the plot thickens. The last three books I read were The Dharma Bums by Jack Kerouac, What The Buhdda Taught by Dr Walpola Rahula and The Inner Reaches of Outer Space.

All three of these discuss the idea of time and space as being a repeating, circular process. 

The game trivial pursuit board also embodies this process in the game play as well as bearing some resemblance to the Buddhist Dharma Wheel although fewer spokes (I understand the importance of the spokes in the dharma wheel as being the noble eight-fold paths)

Tolkien's Elvish writing, the Tengwar",ewmodemac,17,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/14rade/ama_a_system_of_divination_and_magical_reading/,"Having developed it to the point where it can now be put into general use, here is a system of divination and magical readings based upon J.R.R. Tolkien's Elvish writing, the Tengwar.  This particular alphabet has had personal meaning for me for two-thirds of my lifetime (since the late 1970s, in fact), and as such I decided to adopt it as my magical alphabet when I embraced Chaos magic.  Consequently, the method of reading takes its ideas from sigil magic (for the generation of the characters) and the Futhark Runes (for assigning ""meaning"" to the symbols). Some folks would see the significance of my introducing this system on the date of 12/12/12 – but, as with many occurrences in magic, this is a coincidence. It's also a partial coincidence that I developed this system at the time of the release of the first of the movies in The Hobbit trilogy. I realized that this would be a good time to introduce this to the public, as the movies are bringing J.R.R Tolkien into the public eye once again. However, this system is not based upon the movies – if it was, then I would be using the Futhark Runes instead of the Tengwar. Also, just as important: I am not selling anything based upon this system or the movies.  By the way, I know about the Lord of the Rings tarot deck. I have never looked at it and I don't own a copy.

In the last few weeks I've tried to do a lot of thinking, and I feel like I'm beginning to open up my mind to other, non-materialistic models of how the universe might operate (a couple of essays by Ramsey Dukes were extremely helpful in this), but I  think I'd be doing myself a favor by studying some of the classics before trying anything else - Crowley, Regardie, the Kabbalah, Hermeticism, the Golden Dawn, and others.  It's a good idea to explore well-worn paths before trying to set off on my own.

However, classical Western occultism has one noticeable, almost universal, property which I find a huge roadblock: Many, many of its practices are deeply rooted, as far as I can tell, in Abrahamic religious symbolism.  The Kabbalah is Jewish mysticism, many rituals invoke the archangels, Hebrew is often incorporated into workbooks - I fully allow that I have not done much in-depth research and may be misinterpreting something, but my immediate impression is that it is necessary to have regard for the God of the Jews in order to delve into classical occultism.  As anyone who read my last post will probably recall, I was effectively raised as an atheist, and I have only ever felt negatively toward anything having to do with the Bible and am extremely uncomfortable with the idea of invoking any figure or symbolism from Jewish, Christian, or Muslim scripture.  I try to avoid your typical ""durr Christianity is evil"" r/atheism circlejerking, but even from a very young age - like, four - I can remember being uncomfortable with the concept of people having genuine regard for YHVH.  *Temple of Doom* was my favorite Indiana Jones movie specifically because it was the only one which didn't feature the Christian God in it.

Is this something I'm just going to have to get over - grit my teeth and bear it?  Is it necessary to actually believe  in God and Heaven order to follow the most basic ceremonial rituals?  Or is the use of Abrahamic symbolism in certain circles just a means to an end - a ""these beliefs are not absolute, this is just how things work best for me"" type deal?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  I'm frankly better versed in Norse mythology than I am in Christian, and I find the tangled history of Western occultism and all its different circles of belief to be extremely confusing.

The house was owned by the judge in her particular county (Pueblo, Colorado) who acted as judge, jury and executioner. There were a lot of innocent deaths on the property in the 19th century. On top of that, the judge committed suicide in the kitchen.

My family bought it in the 60's and numerous things have happened; to all of us. My dad was tormented and harassed as a child; things thrown at him, being cornered and terrified, etc. My 3 aunts have had paranormal things happen to them, but nothing negative.

My family remained in contact with the family they bought it from; The Lynches. My dad eventually went to them for more information about his tormentors and they told him lots of stuff about an open vortex and spirits constantly moving in and out of the house. 

My father told me he used to hear his mother up late at night talking to ""them."" He would leave his room and ask her who she was talking to, and in a semi trance, she would point to the chair and say ""him."" 

My grandmother is a wonderful woman. Everyone whose ever met her loves her. She is incredibly warm, open and loving; but she's also seemingly operating in another dimension. She's seen a lot in her life, and she seems to just breeze through everything. She's also an artist. 

All over the property, what we always deemed as her decorating and doing artsy things are being revealed as attempts to protect her family. There are over 20 bottle trees, which I now know come from a Hoodoo tradition to protect from evil spirits. 

But, my aunt recently came across some information- she says the circle pattern in both the brick basement floor and patio (both of which my grandmother laid) are an old form of protection. They are about 9' in diameter and radiate from the center of either the patio or the basement.

She said she's found more circle patterns in other projects my grandmother did as well, and is going to show me next time I visit.

I'd simply ask my grandmother herself about it, but she refuses to admit to anything. This started about 25 years ago; she used to openly talk about the spirits and the occult and now says there's no such things as ghosts and she simply likes the look of bottle trees. I'm assuming she'd say something similar about the circles.

I've looked online- do you all know anything about protective circles like that?

I've been playing hooky from occult skool lately and amassing quite a pile of philosophy books. I minored in philosophy and spent years reading all the pomos and cultural anthropologists. I never took a liking to the classics and enlightenment thinking until I started seeking a ""dark"" reading of Marx and/or Hegel. 

Eventually i discovered ""political theology"", process philosophy, Carl Schmitt, Kojeve, Leo Strauss, Voegelin etc and the rest is history.

It seems as though a Straussian reading of natural law, Machiavelli, enlightenment and classical liberalism is about as close as one can come to a ""conspiratorial"" academic reading of philosophy proper.

This is fascinating stuff.

Basically, the traditional (read impotent and naiive) reading of the enlightenment and then hegelian/Marxist thought is ""Evil is other people"", to butcher some French guys trope.

The Machiavellian answer is contrary to the idea of evil being some peripheral, amorphous dark cloud swirling around ""over there"", never to be approached.

Rather, the Machiavellian best practice is to climb right into the dark cloud, start yanking on the levers and turning knobs and shit.

So basically we are talking about an institutional academic reading of political philosophy as luciferianism.

The Straussian reading is William Cooper/behold a pale horse level radical atheism. But really these guys are just saying what the real function of religion/government has always been. 

God building is deification of man and by extension the men who populate the eye of the temple and ""edit"" the religious scripture. While state building is the deification of ""architecture"" of the logos or the practical application of the ""Law"".

Anyways, I am hoping you guys will get something out of this and perhaps have similar views on politics and occult studies.

I have oscillated from hard left progressive to hard right/anarchist/libertarian progressive (fold up all large institutions) in the last year and dont see myself going back.

I largely feel as though most occult practice is formative and transitory, although serves a crucial transitional function. 

In other words after 3-4 years in the OTO/Masons you are likely to be face-smashed against the glass ceiling of radically diminishing returns.

I will always meditate and practice yoga, of that there is no doubt, but as far as the more baroque fashions of the occult, I will likely leave them to the more adventurous and less ominous among you.

If it weren't for my head-on excursion into the occult a few years ago I wold never have come to the conclusions I have come to and would have never really ""got"" philosophy.

For the first time in my life, I can pick up Kant or Plato or whoever and intuitively *understand* what is being said and the reason why is because studying the occult re-empowered *radical and personal meaning* for me, thus changing the way I intend a view of intellectual information.

Studying the occult for me, made language magic again. So in a way we could look at it like NLP, transgrammar, psycholinguistics, general semantics. It's not that I read for things that aren't there rather, I interpret the text based on the malleability of my paradigm as a tool of meaning in and of itself.

I am of course not implying that all philosophers are ""saying the same thing"", only that there is much more of value when one takes it ""seriously"" in just such a way that is potentially transformative, not for outwardly aesthetic and fashionable ""use"" but for intimate (self) understanding.


For philosophy to be real, one must be willing to, at least for a time, continually blaspheme against not only popular convention but even one's most deeply held ""intellectual"" beliefs.

And this may be where beginning occult studies is most crucial. When one transgresses the former limits of your culturally given self, one's ""original sin"", one feels the exhilaration and mysticism of being ""unable to go back"" after a transgression of sort. In a practical sense, this experience is jungian.

It may be like astral travel for the first time. You were never aware you could fully leave the body or take off a paradigm and play dress up with other paradigms arbitrarily.

Without experiencing this or ""receiving"" this secret teaching, one is not truly free nor changeable.

In fact, I would argue that mysticism and blasphemy, at least initially, are two sides of the same coin.

The process we saw from renaissance philosophy and the enlightenment was this compulsion to wrest objective scientific thought free from the theocratic political violence of the church. 

Heliocentrism while clearly an ""occult"" and mystically rooted concept was proved true with Math and geometry and a few daring minds.

It was such a beautiful paradox that took place because the church had become a violent and brain dead status quo totalitarian zombie stifling all thouany.

Then you had a ""bubble"" of extremely intelligent and quirky hermetic/gnostic/jacobin/rosicrucian/Masonic groups, in irony of ironies, giving birth to modern day Math and science and smuggling it right under the noses of the church in the babbling scrolls of ""alchemy"".

No doubt they believed their mystical teachings of Hermes etc. yet their fantastical thought sort of cancelled out the overt dogma of the church and an ""objective"" system of science and reason was born! Wtf?

This short alchemical ""bubble"" epoch was humanities Hegelian moment of blasphemy where first the philosophers were mystified by jumbled up anachronistic misreadings and mistranslations of near east and far east alchemy while simultaneously using their secret meetings and mystical starry eyed empowerment to hash out the integral and delta y. Calculus, infinitesimals and the search for intimate proximity to the infinite were indeed blasphemous ideas at the time no matter how they were broached so long as they were approached in some unacceptable way, unauthorized by the church and it's hierarchy.

And at the core of all of this is the meaning and limits of language.

So Basically IMO, The sterile, limp-wristed, cosmopolitan secular world we have now is a direct result of the fruits of the enlightenment.

For all of post-modernisms naivety and inept political inadequacy, they got some things right.

Specifically, lacan, deleuze and guattari, Derrida and Foucault, and all their talk about the ""text"", schizophrenia and bio-politics, were ironically, or deceptively AFFIRMING the magical structure and power of language. 

Existentialism and post-structuralisms pre-occupation with language being this kind of infinite regression in the absence of ""grand signifiers"" is basically EXACTLY what you have on an individual and collective level when people lose the power of shamanic/mythic meaning making.

I see a definite lineage from Enlightenment to post-modernism to chaos magic. Fascinating stuff.

What is so frustrating about some of the rock stars of that movement like Foucault for example,  is that there is NO WAY that he didn't Intimately and intuitively see the correlation between, language, magic and anthropology and his whole schtick. For Chris sake his whole thing was about how language bound the body to a new type of ""liberal"" totalitarianism. Baudrillard on the other hand, you can tell he was a broken mystic.

And if Foucault speaks of the effects of ""sanitized"" and institional language on the body, then here we could also mention McLuhan's media as a new and radical transformation of the ""architecture"" of language, the corrugated conduits down which language passes bouncing back forth, echoing and distorting before ""massaging"" (steam rolling) the body in society. Paul Virilio continues Mcluhans thinking in a more ethical, perhaps less anthropological, regard.

So what? Well I think the point is that these people whether they are atheist materialists or pantheistic mystics, PROVE the magical properties of language and it's constant re-defining as THE battleground of history. Perhaps why we don't study magic ""academically"" or anthropologicly as a general matter of course up at the kollijiz. They also demonstrate rather well the idea that TRUE philosophers, like sorcerers and shamans, imbue reality with a type of meaning, inevitably effacing reality. They don't read history after the fact, they write it in its realist sense.

It's like all of existentialism and the post-modern cannon was this grand canyon like tour to the edge of the abyss of God and meaning and all those french fucks did was spend the past 70-80 years finding every conceivable way and every style possible of *describing* the Inpenetrable unnapproachability (how very Kantian of them) of this abyss that they were standing a couple Hundred feet from. 

Of course some smart asses (thank God) in the crowd (peter lamborn wilson, peter carroll etc) finally got tired of it, jumped the rail and dove in head first.

I would like to qualify all of what I have said. While I am currently doing a Nietzschean/Straussian reading of history and ""meaning"", ultimately I do see a more Gaian solution to our problems being necessary and inevitable. 

Ephemeralization and tight quarters in the noosphere spells destruction if we continue down the didactic path.

Low-prep working to aid an opportunity for employment, performed after sending out a résumé to a highly promising job opening. 

I used the Thoth Tarot to conceptualize the situation and desired result. The cards were not used in a divinatory manor but as a means of Qabalistic analysis and a point of focus. Upon the cards I placed token items for further symbolization. I am quite satisfied with this technique as a means of analysis and as a ritual device.

This device was created very simply, by first going through the deck and selecting cards which may be appropriate to the situation and desired result. This group of cards is considered, refined and arranged in some sensible and harmonious positioning. The Thoth Tarot's named pip cards and inspired imagery were of great help to my novice construction, which combines Qabalistic analysis with personal intuitive / artistic composition. The device was created in less than two hours from items on-hand; I feel it is complete and functional but I may refine it further.

Ace of Wands, with quartz crystal

Two of Wands - Dominion, with sword token

Three of Wands - Virtue, with orange Door glyph stone


Trump XIV - Art, with six-petaled token


Six of Swords - Science, with scarab token

Six of Wands - Victory, with solar token

Six of Disks - Success, with green-wrapped key and plated penny

Six of Cups - Pleasure, with rose token


The ace, two and three of wands stand in the supernal positions to denote fiery will as the source of this action. A quartz point on the ace of wands emphasizes the clarity and purity of will in Kether. This will emanates to Chokmah as dominion via wisdom, which the sword token enforces as intellectual and directed onwards towards Binah. The masculine two reaches the feminine three as virtue, here representing the appropriateness and worthiness of the endeavor. The token here is a glyph stone of my own design whose symbolic content relates to the opening of doors and the sphere of intellect. 

The central card, Trump XIV (Art in the Thoth Tarot), serves as a point of transition and transmutation. As the path from Foundation to Beauty, the place of the final four cards, it stands here representative of manifestation towards a more perfect goal state from the Foundation of the present (the date 9/9).  The six-petaled token is a simplified version of a personal symbol / tool of Qabalistic analysis, and its rainbow petals here also suggest the refraction of the fiery spirit into the full spectrum of elemental expression below in Tiphareth.

The four sixes proceed from left to right. The applied intellectual faculties of Science are presented first, as a means to the other results and a result of itself. The continual self-fed growth of knowledge and skill is marked by the scarab token as an act of becoming.
After Science comes Victory - in the literal of this working this refers to getting the job itself. The fiery will has reached its goal in Tiphareth. A shining metal rosette serves as a token of solar glory. 

Victory brings Success and the will's journey brings physical rewards. A key wrapped in green thread represents a new and peaceful place to live, as we currently cannot afford to move out of a poisonous housing arrangement. A penny denotes the reward of (modest) financial security; its golden plating suggests the intent is not to amass legal tender but to meet our needs and profit spiritually. 

The final fruit is Pleasure, which has too long been stifled by poverty and hostile environment. The rose token here has many meanings relating to the potential of this full manifestation, particularly the blossoming in new and fertile ground.

I'm not certain some concepts can translate into American English or into Western Thought, but I hope this allows some seekers of the Mysteries to gain some limited perspective, however flawed that perspective might be.

At best, regard this work as a curiosity or ignore it entirely; meditate on the original Emerald Tablet or better yet, seek gnosis only in yourself.  I'm sorry I can't offer anything of real value, just broken words and garbled messages.

1.  It is true, without a lie, certain and most true,
2.  The physical world mirrors the mental world and the mental world mirrors the physical world, to perform the functions of the mind.
3.  And as all things were from the mind, by means of the meditation of the mind, thus all things were born from the mind, by means of transmutation.
4.  Its wisdom is the conscious mind, its understanding is the subconscious mind, the Will nurtured its development, its caretaker is the physical body.
5.  The wisdom of the whole world is here
6.  Its power is whole
7.  7a.  If it is turned into a physical body, 7b. you will separate the physical body from pure thought, the conceptual from the illusory, by meditation.
8.  Ascend from the physical body into the mind, and unite the power of mental and physical things.
9.  Thus you will have the knowledge of the whole world.
10. Therefore all obscurity will flee from you.
11. This is true strength, because it will conquer all that is conceptual, and penetrate all that is physical.
12. Thus was the world created.
13. From this were wonderful transmutations, of which this is the means.  Therefore am I Thrice-Great Hermes, having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world.
14. It is finished, what I have said about the workings of the conscious mind.

4. The nature of complex systems means that it is almost impossible for any reality to reproduce itself exactly, indeed there is greater likelihood that the sub-models will be mutations of the original, subject to different structures and laws.

5. Because the models severely outnumber the original reality, or realities, it is therefore more likely that we are living in a universe modelled as information, and it is most likely that it is not identical to the original reality.

&gt;The identification of the Daemon with specific deific forms through votive practices permits the Adept to commune with the Reality which informs, or creates the perceptions of, such telesmata. It permits him to utilise fully the vehicles or 'Forms' of Belief in order to transcend the limitations of their outer appearance and thus overcome the restrictions of his own circumstance. He thereby facilitates communication with the Powers and Intelligences which are masked by Name, Number, Image and Symbol. Passing through such Gates he participates within the Reality veiled by Myth and Rite, and partakes wholly of Otherness Ineffable. By Self-enchantment, Alignment, and Iconoclasm the Divine Artist ensorcels Belief, identifies with its apotheosis, and, through this complete identification, the Object or Icon of Belief ceases to be his *Other*: he passes beyond the death of its form in becoming its Living Truth.

It really resonates with me, especially at this particular point in my Path, and in a way echoes a doctrine I've recently been working with in my personal practice: that in wandering amidst the entanglement of lies one must embody the Lie, lest one lose sight of the Truth of one's steps. To identify wholly and transcendentally with Belief and its myriad Masks entails just the above, which is to pass beyond the death of forms, and further unify the Mind with Spirit, the Spirit with Chaos, Chaos with the Will, and Will with the Living Truth...",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,True,,,True,t3_pg2ry,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/pg2ry/on_the_divine_artist/,
1327682608.0,11,self.occult,oza5n,A study of which way the court cards face in the R-W tarot deck.,spellraiser,13,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/oza5n/a_study_of_which_way_the_court_cards_face_in_the/,"I just love falling down rabbit holes that get deeper and deeper. This happened when I decided to study if there was any pattern to which way the figures in the court cards in the Rider-Waite deck face. The idea came to me as a flash of intuition in a meditation session.

This is how it looks like (in the order page, knight, queen, king):

    &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;  - Swords
    &lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;  - Wands
    &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;  - Cups
    &gt;&gt;&lt;&gt; - Pentacles

The only caveats is that the king of swords is somewhat ambiguous, as he is almost facing directly head on - but I nevertheless decided that the he can be seen to looking to the left rather than to the right.

Anyway, this is a pretty distinct pattern. For each of the pages, knights, queen and kings, two are looking to the left and two are looking to the right. Within each suit, the knight always faces in the same direction as the king, while the queen faces the opposite direction. Two of the pages face the same way as the queen, and the other two face the same way as the king and knight. There's also a lot going on visually, but I won't go into the details as it's fairly obvious.

It's always somewhat dubious to claim with certainty that some pattern that you are presented with is definitely not random, but I think that in this case one is justified in claiming that's it's highly unlikely that a pattern like this would occur if there was no particular thought given to how the court cards face.

It gets even more interesting when you decide to interpret this information as binary numbers. Of course, one has to decide whether left means 0 and right means 1, or the other way around, but it turns out that this is somewhat irrelevant.

In the former case we get this:

    &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt; = 1010 = 10 - Swords
    &lt;&lt;&gt;&lt; = 0010 = 2 - Wands
    &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; = 0101 = 5 - Cups
    &gt;&gt;&lt;&gt; = 1101 = 13 - Pentacles

While in the latter case we get this:

    &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt; = 0101 = 5 - Swords
    &lt;&lt;&gt;&lt; = 1101 = 13 - Wands
    &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; = 1010 = 10 - Cups
    &gt;&gt;&lt;&gt; = 0010 = 2 - Pentacles

So, it doesn't matter how you map this pattern into binary - it defines the same set of numbers no matter how you do it. Now, this is a property that applies only to a very small subset of all the possible patterns that could arise from the way these 16 cards face. To be exact, it *only* happens when two of the suits are the exact inverses of the other two suits, as is the case with the pattern under consideration. When this applies, two of the suits are obviously constrained by the other two, so we only really have freedom to arrange two suits. The way in which two suits can be arranged has 2^8 possibilities, while the entire arrangement of four suits has 2^16 possibilities. So the ratio of arrangements that have the property of defining a unique set of numbers in binary no matter which encoding you use is (2^8 / 2^16) * 100 = 0.390625%. Again, this in no way proves conclusively that the pattern was selected so that it has this property (let's call it Property P for future reference), but it's certainly food for thought.

And we're not quite out of the rabbit hole yet. Let's look at some of the properties of these numbers, like the reciprocal sum.

    2 -&gt; 2
    5 -&gt; 5
    10 -&gt; 1
    13 -&gt; 4

So we have the numbers 1 - 5, excluding 3, but what's interesting here is that a 3 can be found within the entire set of numbers. Either like this:

    2 + 5 + 10 + 13 -&gt; 30 -&gt; 3 (All the sets that have Property P happen to add up to 30 btw)

Or like this:

    2 + 5 + 1 + 4 -&gt; 12 -&gt; 3

I checked all the sets that have Property P (there's actually only 28 of them if you ignore the ordering of the suits and disclude the sets of repeated pairs, like (2, 2, 13, 13), where it's obvious that you're never going to get a set of four distinct reciprocals) and found the set 1, 14, 4, 11 is the only other set that maps to the reciprocals 1, 2, 4 and 5, so this looks like another very interesting property.

Let's finally order the eight sets mentioned, like so:

    0 - 15
    1 - 14
    2 - 13
    3 - 12
    4 - 11
    5 - 10

Also, I am having a hard time tracking the source for this, apparently it is Albert Einstein, as cited in *The Jain Path*: ""I do not know if there is rebirth or not, or life after death. But, if it is true, I would like to be born in India as a Jain.""

In the book, the author points out that symbolic healing procedures do not work very well unless that are situated within a larger cultural religion (made up of myth and ritual).

So, in theory then, we should be able to construct particularly powerful magical rituals and acts by leveraging the most powerful ""religious"" symbols and myths in our culture.  In fact, magic based on the (unacknowledged) myths we grew up with will be more effective than magic based on our own idiosyncratic personal religions constructed from historic religions.

So, what are these myths, symbols, and gods of our modern age?

Zombies!

Vampires!

Money!

Internet!

Science!

America! The Troops!

And the grandaddy of them all, Modernity itself, anthropomorphized in the child-abducting figure of Slenderman (which evolved from the [thin man sculpture](https://www.google.com/search?um=1&amp;safe=active&amp;rlz=2CASMAE_enUS0537US0537&amp;hl=en&amp;authuser=0&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=thin+man+sculpture&amp;oq=thin+man+sculpture&amp;gs_l=img.3..0.1699.7852.0.7967.30.13.6.5.7.0.258.1887.4j6j3.13.0...0.0.0..1c.1.17.img.5p5GU0kEStQ&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.48705608,d.dmg&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=677&amp;emsg=NCSR&amp;noj=1&amp;ei=C5bTUf24F_Xl4AP9kIHQDg) of Giacometti).

These are the true gods and myths of our age, but they are usually not acknowledged as such because of our modern bias against religion.

What other powerful and pervasive modern myths can you think of that commonly go unidentified? How are they enacted in our daily rituals?

Previously, I have only read about it, like overviews and broad explanations.  Three days ago, I began reading The New Living Qabalah and doing the suggested exercises.  The first night, I had a dream that 'taught' me I need to be vegan (after nearly a decade of vegetarianism attempting to go vegan numerous times but not having the motivation to get serious about it) and more conscious/awake as in the dream I was in the next century or so and saw the human race ruined Earth and treated animals &amp; plants solely as food.  The next day, I had a series of dreams in different REM cycles (or at least with no transitions but scenes), about abundances of things- food, ants (which IRL i have a phobia of, but in my dream they were just pesty because there were SO many) and health/energy in my friend's currently very ailing dog.  Last night, I dreamt of flying (which I've never remembered happening in a dream) into outerspace, of wildlife, of connections with people I know.  Along with these dreams, I have felt more alive/less cluttered.  Not focused per se, but my train of thought/emotion/reaction/etc is more of a river than a rapid.

All of these dreams have been very vivid and real in the sense of I was certain it was happening although I didn't know it was a dream until I woke up.  These were not lucid dreams, nor were they the typical dreams I have where it's more of a movie featuring me (not usually connected to emotions/thoughts/viewpoint).

I have spoken briefly to the two people I know that have (seemingly) a considerable amount of occult knowledge (none of them do I know well enough that I feel comfortable sharing all of this- one is a co-worker and the other is just barely more than an acquaintance) and have been warned about how powers cultivated in the wrong way are dangerous mentally or can be improperly 'raised' much like a well meaning but clueless kid might raise its first pet fish only to have it die in a week.

My concerns are if these kinds of things are results of starting studying.  Certainly, it could just be my overall excitement of starting something new along with , I should mention (maybe) my increased amount of time spent in the sun lately and the good people &amp; vibes I've been around.  I am also curious if there is any symbolism that stands out in the dreams that could be a warning?  And if having such other-worldly dreams is associated with anything.

Thank you for any and all respectful input.",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,False,,,True,t3_1emfaj,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1emfaj/sudden_drastic_changes_after_beginning_to_study/,

I was thinking the next step up could be tatooing it as a symbol of my commitment to this will.

Have any of you done this or known magicians who have? What results were experienced? What are the pros and cons?

So I've had people with a lot of letters behind their names tell me I'm depressed and they have given me pills for it. Medicine is an interesting magick unto itself but it only seems to be getting halfway there.

One day while talking to a friend, she mentioned the Chinese Buddhist concept of the [hungry ghost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_ghost). Very rarely in my life do I get this unmistakable pulling feeling on the back of my neck indicating that what I next see or hear is going to be important, and that sensation announced my friend speaking about these ghosts.

So I wanted to know if any of you know about curses that could be caused by these beings or maybe it's haunting me. Banishing rituals? I'm mostly looking for Inspiration to add more of a magickal edge to my trying to not be miserable almost all the time.

**Edit**  
I've been talking to someone about the psychological manifestations of this problem but would like to also see what it looks like from the spiritual. Try a different videre if you will. Look at the problem from a different angle and I was wondering what the spiritual angle would be since the very brief description of hungry ghosts that I heard sounded a lot like the symptoms I get.

I'm bored with most things, and when I do have fun it takes only a matter of minutes once the activity is over before I feel like crap again. Continuously craving more life than I get.
