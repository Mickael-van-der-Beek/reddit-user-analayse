Tell me what you've always wanted to see! AMA,TakeAimPictures,41,4,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1chkvj/xpost_from_rgaming_iama_director_getting_ready_to/,"My name is Coleman McClung, I'm a filmmaker in the Dallas/Austin, TX scene, and in a few months, I'll be shooting the largest independently made fan film based on the Resident Evil franchise.

Thanks to awesome productions such as ""Portal: No Escape"" and ""Halo: Forward Unto Dawn,"" the possibility of high quality, live action adaptations of video games being made and getting noticed is more realistic than ever. 

Our film: ""Resident Evil: Arklay,"" is a story-driven horror film that is aiming to grant fan's wishes for a more game inspired experience. With over forty-five crew members, five locations, multiple practical effects and SAG associated actors, things get expensive very quickly. Even with the dedicated investors who already believe we can pull this off, we still need more help from the fans. So we're going to do a quick forty day indiegogo to collect the rest of the funds we need to completely immerse you in the atmosphere and story of the classic first game in the series.

Check out our project page at: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/resident-evil-arklay

Then come back here and ask any question related to why you should help out and what makes this more than just another fan film.


tl;dr - You're awesome/we're awesome; lets make a movie.

EDIT: I appreciate all the well wishes, and I'll continue to answer any more questions under this or the original posting. The only way this is going to happen though, is if you share the link and donate whatever you're able to. I need to see this script go into production, and I think all of you will be rewarded when it does.

After playing the first chapter, my 14 year old (at the time) sister asked me if she could try playing. To my surprise, she wasn't bad at all and she actually enjoyed punching and stomping zombies. We played through the entire game together and loved every minute of it (except the motorcycle zombies. I admit, that was just stupid). And now I'm a huge RE fan and am working my way backwards (for some reason) playing the other RE games and we cannot wait for the 6th to be released.  

Are we the only ones who enjoyed this game?

I'll be honest, I run a game review site, but I just don't think reviews are that important these days.  There's a lot of one-upmanship going on.  Also, people are just waiting to rip into certain games before they even play them.  

Am I explaining away RE6's faults?  No way.  If a game has issues, it has issues.  But these reviews are so subjective.  I look at it this way - you all played the demo. Did you like that? If you did, the game is a longer version of that.  

We all know this game isn't survival horror.  But should a game be faulted for a creative decision? I don't think so.  I feel bad that a quality game (I won't say good or bad) is going to get a terrible reputation because some neckbeards are pissed that they aren't playing RE1 over and over again.

I'm not going to hate about the modern games, resident evil 4 is great and I'm nearly peeing myself in excitement for 6. But my favorite of all time is the Resident Evil rebirth for the GameCube. I still play it all the time. Scared the shit out of me when I was a kid playing it, and it still has the ability to disturb me some times.

My problem is that I have absolutely nobody to share it with. I have one close friend who likes resident evil; I let him borrow 0, 1 and 2 but he claims they're too slow and boring.

I have an awesome Umbrella Corporation shirt, and I always get compliments from random RE fans when I wear it. When I strike up small-talk with them about the game, it turns out they either only watch the movies. If they play any of the games, it's 4 and 5.

Everything else in that game seemed a little tame or even comical and not scary at all, with the exception of maybe U3.

I really enjoyed the Leon campaign. It was kind of a throwback to the original series in a way. Being able to shoot and walk is always a plus. Being able to kick is nice also. I have a feeling that you can run out of ammo very quick being able to fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. So does this mean no more gun upgrades? Overall I think I will enjoy this campaign the best.

Next was the Chris campaign. It is basically Call of Duty within the Resident Evil universe. I'm not liking this one at all. It doesn't feel like a survival horror which the series should be. I can only hope that it gets better throughout the game, but I have a feeling that it won't.

The last campaign was the only one I died in. That is because I got trapped in a corner being attacked by 2 raptor type creators. I couldn't even get a shot in before I was killed. I think this is my fault for trying to fight through a hoard inside of trying to sneak by, which I also hate. I'll have another go at it just to see what I'm actually suppose to do, because the enemies seemed a little overpowered there for only having a pistol. 

I'd like to hear what your thoughts are when you get a chance to try the demo. I just wish the whole game could be the Leon style. I think the developers were trying to get different styles in to bring more players. And if that's the case I think they have failed.",,False,self,t5_2s0lb,False,,,True,t3_103asm,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/103asm/thoughts_on_re6_demo/,

1371665733.0,16,self.residentevil,1go4zd,Favorite Memories?,DDDowney,23,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1go4zd/favorite_memories/,"While I'm waiting for Revelations to install, I thought I'd share something with you guys. 

Many years ago when I was a small boy, I went to my grandmother's house. Her youngest son, still a teenager at the time was out with friends which meant his room was empty and I could jump on to his, what I thought was, awesome Sega Saturn to play some games. After dying many times in Panzer Dragoon and struggling to figure out Myst (I was a dumb child). I saw Resident Evil's case.


 
 
 
Now my dad raised me on horror movies since I was little (even younger than here in this story) and I loved it. Seeing a zombie on the cover interested me, so I popped it in to the disk tray. I didn't get very far, as when the first cutscene showed where the zombie leaned away from eating your friend (Memory fails me, Kenneth? maybe?) and stared at you. I practically shit my pants. [warning: extremely dated and not scary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe6srxp1-9I) I jumped up and shut the console off. 


 
 
a year or two later, and my school chums were all raving about Resident Evil 2. I thought I was more brave since the last time, and I wanted to be cool, so I wanted it. My dad had recently visited a black friend of his, and I only say that because the only memory I have of this man is that he was the southern version of Wayne Brady. His friend showed him Resident Evil on his playstation. This is why my parents refused to let me get Resident Evil 1 or 2. 


 
 

 
Understandably so, I know now that horror games are much scarier than movies because of the overwhelming amount of immersion games have over movies. That, and I'm almost positive there was a big ""GAMES ARE EVIL"" campaign going on. So for awhile I had to ignore my friends as they talked about how awesome Raccoon City was. 


 
 
  
  
Forward a few more years and it's Christmas. My dad hands me a gift, and as I open it, I freak out like that Nintendo 64 kid. In my hands is Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. This was not only a gift I wanted, but a token of my dad showing me he knew I could handle whatever was thrown at me without peeing myself or going insane. Together, and with some of my aged relatives, we played it over a summer weekend and beat it. 

That is my favorite memory in the series, not just because of how happy I was my dad trusted me with the game, but because the game became my favorite entry in the series. To this day I love the Nemesis mechanic of him going out at any time and possibly ruining your shit. Espically if you just juggled your inventory and put a weapon away for a puzzle piece. He was intense, much more so than Birkin to me. 



Also back then I thought every zombie on the screen had to be killed so I died to Nemesis a lot.

Unlimited Ammo (Leon's Campaign)
While you are playing through Leon's campaign, there's a trick you can use to obtain extra ammo when you're running low. As long as you have a few shots remaining in your magazine, you can obtain a full magazine's worth of bullets even if you don't have any additional clips. Simply aim down your weapon's sights by holding the left trigger button, then press Y so that you switch to dual-wielding mode. Now press Y again to switch back to the standard mode, and you should find that your current ammo clip has been refilled. You can continue to perform that trick to avoid running out of ammo.

Should help a lot if you are having trouble with ammo. Good luck!",,False,self,t5_2s0lb,False,,,True,t3_10xld8,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/10xld8/a_little_trick_for_unlimited_ammo_in_leons/,

My opinion on the two sides arguing about the series' new direction.",RichardDickThrusting,22,6,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/wsswu/i_posted_this_in_rgaming_but_i_think_its_darn/,"A lot of people have been telling Resident Evil fans to shut up about how the Resident Evil series is going. If it is all right (and I know I'll get tons of downvotes, but hopefully some people will agree with me), I would like to add my own two cents to this.

I have been a die hard Resident Evil fan since 2002. It was the first M-rated game that I played, and it made me fall in love with survival horror. I have played every game until now. When Resident Evil 4 came out, I was impressed and loved it. When Resident Evil 5 came out, I was severely disappointed.

This is where people come in and tell fans like me to shut the hell up because Resident Evil needed a change. I have to agree that the gameplay in the older games was getting stale, and the series needed to head in a different direction - gameplay wise. Resident Evil 4 was magnificent because it was still survival horror, but it added a new action aspect to the series. It was well done and very fun.

Resident Evil 5 was NOT well done. It was not scary; the AI was terrible; and Co-Op was NOT necessary (that itself took away a huge portion of the scares). Resident Evil 5 turned the series into a simple action game with no horror that only tried to play off the success of 4. I recognized no Resident Evil aspects, save for the characters.

I have many friends who started playing Resident Evil as with 5, and they hate the older games because of a 5 minute attempt to play one. As the stereotype is currently going, those friends are Call of Duty and Battlefield fans, and they tell me to shut the hell up and accept that the series had to change. I do know, however, that others who are saying this are not fans of those games, but of others.

To this, I would like to say to all of you Call of Duty/Battlefield/other game series fans out there: imagine if the series you loved and grew up with was a well done drama series, and then the game companies decided to suddenly change it into a romping comedy. You'd be angry, but everyone else would say, ""Shut up and accept the change!"" which, I'm guessing, you would not.

The Resident Evil change feels the same way with us fans. A lot of us don't like where the series is going because we feel betrayed. We helped the series get to where it is now, and the creators are shelving everything we love because they want more sales.

So, guys, try to see it through our eyes. Don't tell us to stop bitching; it's a series we love, and we hate to see it get hurt like this. If you only played 5, you have no right to tell us 5 was better than the others. And don't tell us that the series needed changes if you aren't familiar with the other games.

If you liked Resident Evil 5, I'm glad for you. But most of the die-hard fans sure as hell didn't. So stop bitching to us about how we should stop bitching.

TL;DR: Please don't tell Resident Evil fans to shut about about the new direction the series is taking.

I've played the 3DS version and it's one of my favourite RE games not to mention one of the best 3DS titles so I might be biased, but here it goes.

I think it looks pretty good. Character models look great. The texture quality could use some upgrading and it runs extremely smooth, so smooth that it makes it obvious that it's a handheld port. TBH $50 was a bad choice. I don't mind paying it to support the game, but it would have been much smarter to price it like a budget title, closer to the pricing that Rockstar did for the PS2 ports of the PSP GTA titles, $20-$40. For $50 I sort of expected a little more work. As it stands it really is just a graphically upgraded handheld port, plays nearly identical to the 3DS version. The once filled environments look a tad sparse on a 32 inch screen.

The demo was extremely short. It might be because I know that part of the game well but I was done in about 5 minutes. It's barely a full chapter. If it was me I would have chosen a more eventful chapter or included two chapters, the existing Jill &amp; What's his name chapter as well as a Jessica &amp; Chris chapter. There are only about 6-7 monsters in this chapter, no bosses or unique enemies and very few scares.

Controls were very smooth, responsive and tight. I didn't try KB &amp; Mouse controls, used a 360 controller the whole time. IMO 3rd person games of any type play better with a controller anyways. That being said, it plays even better than the 3DSXL with the Circle Pad Pro LL which was previously my favourite way to play this game.

For the $50, it should have included significantly improved textures, and the DLC as part of the game. I'd have a hard time recommending it to others considering they'll be asked to pay $50+DLC costs, which IIRC is actually $10 more than the 3DS version even though it's one of my top 3 Resident Evil titles.

I'd be really interested in other thoughts though. Despite my misgivings about how Capcom has positioned the port, it's still one of my favourite RE titles ever.",,False,self,t5_2s0lb,False,,,True,t3_1ed9bp,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1ed9bp/thoughts_on_the_recently_released_resident_evil/,

1359362204.0,14,self.residentevil,17f4y3,How would you feel if Resident Evil split off at this point?,Lukar115,14,0,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/17f4y3/how_would_you_feel_if_resident_evil_split_off_at/,"I was discussing my want for *Mercenaries 3D* with a friend earlier, and it got me thinking: if you ask me, the *Resident Evil* series needs to branch off now.

My reasoning for this is that, because of Capcom's efforts to modernize the series, there are now two separate fanbases for the games: those who prefer the survival horror gameplay of the older games, and those who like the action seen in *RE5* and *RE6*. Whenever a new game comes out, there's always one side that can't wait for it, and another side that is less than enthusiastic about it. How a side feels is determined by how the game in question plays, of course-- is it survival horror, or action?

Capcom tried to please both ""factions"" with *RE6*, but they largely failed at creating a survival horror experience, and instead created a really fun action game that's even better if you're playing with a friend. I think part of this is because the controls were really too free and unrestrictive for your average horror game; since you can easily avoid enemies, what's going to make you think that you aren't going to make it through the next area? Don't get me wrong, though; I love *RE6*'s controls, but they really aren't what *RE* needs as a survival horror game.

This brings me back to my point: the *RE* series should branch off into two styles of games. The first style, survival horror, would feature controls similar to those seen in *RE4*, *RE5*, and *Revelations*, while the actual gameplay would focus on saving resources (Having to think of if you should kill the enemy in front of you, or if you can't afford to spare the bullets) and scaring the player (Partly by making it feel like the challenge isn't passable, or like it's extremely difficult). The other style, on the otherhand, would play similarly to *RE6*, and would focus almost completely on action. While the story and atmosphere might have horror undertones (Fighting monsters/mutants in dark areas, etc.), the player would essentially be playing your standard third-person shooter, with plenty of ammunition and such available. As for Mercenaries, that could still be included in both styles of games-- thanks to the controls, I think it'd still feel different yet similar enough to justify being in both.

So what do you think? I realize that the series is sort of already split this way, but we haven't seen a true survival horror entry in the series in a very long time, though *Revelations* was definitely on the right track. Meanwhile, I think *RE6* was the right step towards a fun action game, even if it had an identity crisis by trying to please both kinds of fans.

Please feel free to discuss!,Sinopsis,16,3,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/10x383/what_i_dislike_about_re6_please_feel_free_to/,"1. In all other RE's. In the event that you see a corpse on the ground, shooting it to check and see if it is alive or not, was always rewarded with it being killed or getting up from a distance so that it didn't attack you. Now, no matter what, even if you do shoot it first. It will still not get up or die until you're in chomping range.

2. Shooting a zombie in the head with an entire clip of handgun bullets and it's still coming at you. Wtf is that bullshit? And I'm not saying the special zombies, I mean regular old infected...I've shot one in the head four times with a SHOTGUN, for it to keep getting up.

3. The game taking control away from your character to show you something important, but not stopping the progression of imminent zombies. In other words, it takes away your controls and zooms in on a lever, but the entire time it's showing you this; a zombie is inching towards you so that by the time the video is done, it's right there and hits you.

4. The campaign of Leon [consistently NOT rewarding you for your efforts. No tidbits of info or anything to make the mystery juicy. Just told time after time ""Well if we go here I'll tell you, well if we go here I'll tell you, well if we go here I'll tell you."" Making it incredibly predictable that you know when you get there, something will happen and you wont be told a damn thing. No reward for your efforts.](/spoiler)

5. The controls seem a bit wonky....your character doesn't turn as well as it should while running....taking cover on corners and leaning to shoot, only for your character to cover your entire screen so you can't see anything. 

That's just a few problems I have so far, a lot of it is annoying. But I still love the game and it definitely isn't game-breaking for me.",,False,self,t5_2s0lb,False,,,True,t3_10x383,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/10x383/what_i_dislike_about_re6_please_feel_free_to/,

For starters, how does the aiming feel?  I'm not too keen on the cross hairs, but it looked like you still had the laser sight on the gun.  Could you use it to go for more accurate shots when u weren't moving so much?

Also, did anyone play the game without having a co op partner?

1332353006.0,12,self.residentevil,r71y7,Things ORC needs to fix to make it great. ,volothebard,17,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/r71y7/things_orc_needs_to_fix_to_make_it_great/,"Played around 10 hours now (PS3), most of which were with 3 other friends. One of which will be posting a gameplay video to his youtube channel in a day or two. Almost all of my gameplay has been as a medic.

I like the game but there are several things that are holding it back. Unfortunantly those things are pretty major. I'll get right to it.

* Friendly bot AI. I'm sure you've read the reviews already. They are not lying. I have not seen AI this bad...ever I think. They constantly walk in front of you, block doorways, grab/use items that someone else should have used, ignore all mission orders, completely ignore mines setting all of them off, rarely use cover, drop grenades at their feet...the list goes on and on. Anything higher than normal difficulty with bots is simply frustrating. That said I didn't find that the enemy AI was as bad as some of the reviews. They are effectively lethal, especially on the higher difficulty levels.

* Dead players bodies ignore physics. At least 4 times I had issues where a player would die near a table or in a corner or something and their body would fall through the solid object or even through the wall. This means you cannot rez them.

* Revive/swap weapon/""stomp the shit out of"" are all mapped to the X key. For those that haven't played, when a player dies you can revive them by standing over their body and holding x for about 3 seconds. The problem is their weapon also falls on the ground where they died. Also, there is a ""stomp"" maneuver you can perform on an enemy (and apparently an ally). So what happens during combat is when you try to revive a companion you just end up constantly swapping weapons or you stomp the shit out of their face. Very annoying when in the heat of battle.

Funny story, the first game I played I thought the stomping animation was the revive. I thought you were like ""jumpstarting"" their heart or something by stomping on the person. I sat there doing it for probably half a minute before I figured out something was wrong.

* Some of the upgrades are nearly useless. Not the skills themselves, but upgrading several skills beyond the initial unlock has severe diminishing returns. The health spray skill of Bertha is an example of this. All you get for upgrading it is the ability to hold more health sprays. Which would be fine except on veteran and above (the only time you actually need them) they are so rare you will rarely ever have the opportunity to carry more than 2.

* Juggling. Several enemies in the game have juggling skills. That is a knockdown/grab/throw etc that incapacitates your character. Almost every one of these skills ""cooldowns"" are shorter than the ""get up"" animation of your character. This means you will get perma-incapacitated with absolutely no hope of recovery. Often, enemies with these abilities have no way of being interrupted as well so even if your teammates are around there is nothing they can do other than damage the enemy (often shooting you in the process) and hope they kill it before the enemy kills you.

* The cover mechanic needs to be bound to a key. As it is you just press against cover and your character hugs to it. The problem is many times this just doesn't work. You press and press and your character never hugs the cover. Also the dive/roll mechanic, while funny, is basically useless. You run + dive to get behind cover, and while your character will do that, as soon as the dive is over they stand up forcing you to press into cover again. During firefights this is bad.

I hope it doesn't sound like I don't like the game. I'm sure most of us could make a list like this of all of our favorite games. I really like ORC and want to see some patches to make this game great.

Edit: Also, I'd suggest to anyone playing this online: If you are not using voice com then you probably should stick to veteran or below. ",,False,self,t5_2s0lb,True,,,True,t3_r71y7,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/r71y7/things_orc_needs_to_fix_to_make_it_great/,

Survival Horror:


* Parasite Eve 1 &amp; 2 (More rpg like) - Playstation 1

* Haunting Ground (Similar to the RE4 hookman beta) - PS2

* Clock Tower 3 - Scary game - PS2

* Silent Hill - All consoles (I'd recommend 1, 2 (Fucking Scary) and origins)
*Alan Wake - Xbox 360 (Over the shoulder)

* Eternal darkness - Gamecube (Very interesting game, as you play through multiple characters through different time periods, and it all ties in)
* Fatal Frame 1,2,3 - Ps2
* Fatal Frame 4, Wii (Japan only, can hack wii to play)
* Dino crisis 1&amp; 2 - Ps1
* Amnesia - PC (First-person)
* Penumbra - PC (First person)

More action like:

* Dead Space series - Shows obvious influence from RE4- Pc, Xbox 360, Ps3 (Over the shoulder)
* System Shock 2 - PC, very unfinished alpha on dreamcast  (First person)
* Bioshock - PC, Xbox 360, ps3. (First-person)
* Dino crisis 3 - Xbox (It's fucking Dinosaurs in space!)
* Devil May Cry 1-4: 1 was what became of a scrapped version of RE4 -Ps2, Ps3, Xbox 360
* Doom 3 - PC, Xbox (First-person)
* F.E.A.R. Series - PC, ps3, X360 (First person)
On-Rails:

* The House of the dead series - Arcade, Dreamcast, Sega Saturn, Xbox (3 &amp; 2 are on OG, it works on 360), Wii,  Ps3.
* Gun Survivor 3: Dino Crisis 

Any additions would be great!

And I love the voice actress she had in RE5 and the way she talked.

""Don't you trust your partner...?""

So in a nutshell, are the games on PSN OK to start with or would I bastardize the whole thing without starting from the original? Thanks.

I'm 5 hours in now, and I'm all out of ammo and health. How do you handle scenarios like this? It feels like I have no choice but to start over on a lower difficulty setting, but I don't want to loose 5 hours of progress.

1332440754.0,10,self.residentevil,r8p7i,Operation Raccoon City; My honest review.,FiveVidiots,11,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/r8p7i/operation_raccoon_city_my_honest_review/,"Ah, Resident Evil. Your zombies may have disappeared over the last few years, but now they're back! AND in good ol' Raccoon City no less! Throw in some tech that probably shouldn't exist in 1998 (looking at you Vector...), some cameo's of some series favorites and you've got Operation Raccoon City.

According to interviews with the devs, this game isn't to be considered canon, though one ending possibly could be. the campaign is relatively short. A friend and I ran through the 7 chapters in about 5 hours on Normal. That isn't to say the game isn't challenging. Let's move on shall we?

**Graphics: 8/10** The first thing everyone seems to look at nowadays is graphics. To me, graphics don't mean much of anything, I will play a game solely for the enjoyment of the game. I do play with an HDMI input, however, and that makes the game look gorgeous. Yes, as stated in some other reviews, the surrounding areas may seem boring, but that is a matter of opinion. If you're spending your time gazing at the side of a building going 'that building looks boring and dreary', you're missing the point of the game. Anyway, looks great, though there are multiple frame-rate issues. for instance, once in a while when a zombie actually gets his greasy hands on you, he might be a few feet away doing his grab animation and then magically teleporting over to your character when you waggel the stick enough to  get loose. The FPS drops when too many things go on at once as well. This is especially evident online. Too many grenades going off in a crowd of 10+ zombies will cause slight FPS lag. 

**Gameplay: 7.5/10** Oh boy, this is where the game could see some major improvement. Too many things are mapped to one button at a time. For instance, to switch weapons, you tab LB (or L2) BUT, you can also use this to Quick Turn and if you hold it you can use it to auto aim and auto fire your pistol at enemies. 3 commands on one button does not a solid control scheme make. Another problem is the A button (or X button) having about 4 or 5 different actions on it. If a team mate goes down, they drop where they stand (unless a grenade kicks them a few feet) and they also drop their currently equipped main weapon. This can cause problems, you see, as the button to pick up weapons and revive team mates is **MAPPED TO THE SAME BUTTON.** This only really causes distress in Campaign Co-Op, because in Mulitplayer, you can't pick up your team mates once they're dead. The dodge mechanic is hard to pull off. You must move in the direction you want to dodge and then simultaneously click the movement stick in and click A (or X) to dodge. The maneuver is also ineffective. Most times you won't dodge far enough to get out of the line of fire or dodge a Crimson Head and it takes a good second and  half to get up. So even if you manage to dodge the Crimson Head, they'll most likely be right back on top of you pulverizing and Infecting you. The cover aspect of the game can be wonky at times. There's no static button to stick to cover; you just press you character against whatever you're trying to cover behind. Moving on to a new addition; Infection. I believe this game mechanic is a perfect addition to the series. Too long have we been bitten without repercussion. Too elaborate for those who haven't played yet; any zombie (and even the Medic class, with a certain skill) can infect you. This will then slowly start draining your health, and slow you down while turning your screen blue. You can have a team mate spray you with Antiviral Spray, or if you have some yourself, you can use it. This gets rid of the infection. However as soon as you become infected, your team mates CAN target you and put you out of your misery with a head shot if AV Spray isn't on hand. This forces you to stay close to your comrades and far away from zombies. The CQC aspect that has been added is good in concept, unless you're suddenly caught in a string of CQC hits and you can't get out. That's right folks, if someone hits you with one attack of CQC they can pulverize you until you die. There is no QTE to get out of it. The only way to get out of it is hope they miss you with two hits, or a team mate comes around and blasts them hard enough to cause them to stagger. Moving on to every ones favorite subject; The AI! I'll make this part short and easy. It's horrible. Team mates walking into blatantly obvious fires and the line of fire. Blocking door ways. Taking grenades they'll never use. Things along that line. HOWEVER. The one good thing I've found with this AI is that they will try to maximize the effectiveness of the Aide Sprays. They won't be another Sheva, for instance and heal you with a First Aide Spray when you only lost a sliver of health. They will try to get a group of characters together and deploy it only when you're relatively low on health. Bertha is the best option for this, as she can carry extra Aide Sprays. Every character has 2 passive skills and 3 abilities they can activate by pressing Y (or Triangle). These cost XP, which you get by playing MP or Single Player. You can get bonus XP by collecting Data in every level (this also unlocks some of the 161 pieces of concept art) and finding a Raccoon City Mascot as well. Completing story missions with S ranks will net you around 8-9k experience, while multiplayer is significantly less. Nonetheless, multiplayer is great fun. XP Is also used to buy weapons. There's plenty of them to choose from!

**Sound: 9/10** Not much to say here. I enjoyed the music and the voice acting. Except Specter. I don't get why he talks with pauses in his sentences.

**Replay value: High** Since the campaign is short and has plenty of secret loot to be found, and multiplayer adds to the fun, the game can be played multiple times for enjoyment. Want that extra challenge? Try a Professional run. Wanna coast through the campaign and net some extra XP? Go on Casual or Normal.

**Overall: 8.5/10** The game has it's ups and it's downs but it's definitely a great game in the RE series. This will definitely be holding me over until Resident Evil 6 comes out!",,False,self,t5_2s0lb,False,,,True,t3_r8p7i,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/r8p7i/operation_raccoon_city_my_honest_review/,

There is, however, one huge gripe I have: the checkpoint system. I got to the final section of Chapter 2 in Leon's campaign, made sure I saw the little typewriter, and quit my game. When I came back to play, I decided to join an online run of the first chapter to Jake's campaign. When that was over, I thought I'd be able to hit ""Continue"" and get back to that final section of the Leon campaign. Nope. I lost all my progress and have to start it again.

If it were possible, I'd love it for Capcom to release a patch that would return the chapter select from RE5, i.e. Chapter 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2 etc. There are clear breaks in the rather lengthy chapters that the game would have done well to recognize in a more concrete manner.",,False,self,t5_2s0lb,False,,,True,t3_114hde,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/114hde/what_feasible_changes_would_you_like_to_see_in_a/,

Sadly, this isn't the case. Not only is Raccoon City not in the same league as Left 4 Dead, it's not even a decent Resident Evil game.


**OXM: 7.0** - Some diehard Resident Evil fans may be disappointed by Raccoon City for sapping the survival-horror soul out of the series. But the game's satisfying blend of gunplay and teamwork, coupled with its cool references to past Resident Evil games, make revisiting the perilous streets of Raccoon City worth the trip. Even with its failings, Raccoon City keeps the action rolling along; just make sure you bring some buddies to help you slaughter all the undead.


**OPM: 7** - For the large part, whether offline or on, Operation RC manages to successfully inject old skool Resi charm into an enjoyably frenetic shooter. If the idea of battling rooms full of stretchy-tongued monstrosities with athletic controls in iconic surroundings has your Umbrella sense tingling, this is well worth a look.


**Destructoid: 7.5** - Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City suffers from poor design and sometimes doesn't quite seem to ""get"" the point of the style it wishes to emulate, but that doesn't stop it from being a genuinely good time that should satisfy anybody looking for a hardcore romp. As a challenging rollercoaster ride through an iconic fictional catastrophe, Raccoon City provides hours of violent fun interspersed with some exasperated cries of aggravation.


**IGN: 4.0/10** - The terrible AI, the lackluster locations and the complete lack of atmosphere or memorable characters destroy what could have been a brilliant offshoot. In the end, Operation Raccoon City is little more than a poor man's SOCOM, and a destitute man's Resident Evil.


**Game Informer: 6.00** - It's difficult recommending a return to Raccoon when you have to endure buggy AI, clunky gameplay, and terrible glitches like disappearing floors. Not even online play is enough to of a reason to warrant checking out this botched experiment with the Resident Evil brand.


**Eurogamer: 4/10** - Operation Raccoon City is an under-designed and under-produced nightmare, a game that delivers the bare minimum in every category and stops right there.


**Videogamer: 4/10** - Quite why this game even exists is a bit of a mystery. Surely nobody out there is demanding a creaky Left 4 Dead rip-off set in a cardboard-box recreation of the Resident Evil universe, but that hasn't stopped Capcom from diluting and cheapening its strongest brand.

(There's a TLDR section at the end).

I'm not raging by any means, or anything like that. I'm just giving my opinion and thoughts based on what I've read and heard from other people.
I'm not exactly super-passionate about this subject in particular, it's just something that I was thinking about earlier today.

I've noticed a bunch of people don't exactly like the gameplay that's been previewed or tried hands-on for RE6, and I respect that. I mean, it's a game that's not for everyone, and they're taking the gameplay style in a new direction that's brand new for the series!

Just from browsing here and talking to people, a bunch of people have dumped hate on and already condemned the game and told everyone that they're not going to buy the game because it's just too different. 

Same with the movies!
Like it or not, Paul W. S. Anderson (I think that's his name), changed the movies and filmed them in a different way, with some characters that weren't in the original Biohazard series, and he took the plot in a completely different direction.
Yes, this is true, and it's sometimes hard to look at them as actual ""Resident Evil"" movies when there are only a few characters from the actual game series, like Wesker and Jill. 

It's all different, but it's still filmed and produced using the same ""universe"" that the Biohazard series created so vividly.

So now the main point..

(Keep in mind this is my OPINION, and I'm not claiming to be the best person, and I'm not claiming to be better than anyone). 

I think it's hard to really call yourself a true Resident Evil fan if you let things like that get in your way of appreciating the game series.
Like I said, people have different game tastes, and that makes sense.

But.. If you're like me, you're going to play all the Resident Evil games, watch all the movies, but still love them, even if they're not the norm, or produced in a way you don't think really like.
I mean, I'm not the best fan ever. I haven't played them since I was a kid, I haven't bought every game for every system or anything like that.

But I have played enough to make an informed opinion and give my thoughts.

I'm not trying to get on my high horse here, but I think it's better to love the series and games for the simple reason that it IS Resident Evil.

-----

TLDR:

In my OPINION, if you really consider yourself a Resident Evil (Biohazard) fan, you'll play all the games, you'll watch all the movies, and enjoy them for the simple fact that they are Resident Evil creations!

This is all just stuff I felt like writing down, stuff for you to think about if you want to.

Happy gaming, and don't forget to suplex their heads off!

So just to try and see some opinions and spark activity, I have some questions for anyone that wants to answer!



*1.) Easy enough, favorite and least favorite games in the series, and why?*



*2.) Favorite and least favorite characters and why?*



*3.) Is there anything in the series that you love/hate, but everyone else seems to have a very different opinion on it?*



*4.) What was your overall favorite moment in any of the games?*



*5.) What was your favorite location in the series?*



*6.) What was the game that got you hooked into the series?*



*7.) What song would you give your favorite character, not counting their main theme of course!*



*8.) Have you ever cosplayed as a character from Resident Evil?*



*9.) Have a favorite or least favorite couple, pairing, or head-cannon?*



*10.) Last one! If you had to survive Raccoon City with 3 characters or your choice, two from Resident Evil and one from any other form of media, who would you take?*




So, if anyone wants to answer, go for it!
I'll fill it out myself here as well.





1.) **Favorite**
Resident Evil 4. I love all of them, but 4 was honestly the first I really took an instant interest to. The graphics, the level of intensity, MOTHERFUCKING REGENERATORS AND IRON MAIDENS. Ashley was annoying as hell, but she just added to the games sense of urgency and difficulty. 


**Least favorite**
Gotta say... 3. I've actually never beaten it. I just lost interest a good way through. Didn't help that I've had it in for Jill since 1 either.


2.) **Favorite**
 Wesker. I think he's cunning, a genius, and is a COMPLETE badass. Even if he's evil, he's got brains to back himself and his plans up, even if he goes a little whack in RE5. I'm talking RE1 and 4 Wesker. Calm, cool, collected.


**Least favorite** 
Jill. Bring on the hate, go for it. I just don't like her character. I don't see much depth, story, or background. I feel like her only personality trait is being ""heroic."" I don't really know, she just bugs me on a lot of levels. And I've seen SO many complaints on Ada's dress, but look at Jill's outfit in RE3! She's fighting zombies in a miniskirt and tube top. I find that highly unethical. I'm not very logical on why I hate her so much I guess, but I just do.



3.) I feel like a lot of other people love Jill, while I can't stand her. I've never been big on Rebecca either. And I actually like Steve. He's annoying, yes, but I feel for him, somehow.



4.) In Resident Evil 2, you know that licker that comes through the two way glass? FUCK THAT ASSHOLE. But it was easily the moment that scared me the most in the entire series. And I actually really liked fighting garradors in 4. Not the two at once. But the first fight, where you have to walk, and shoot the bells, all that. And the fight with two el giganticas.




5.) **Favorite**  
It's between the underground basement place in RE1 where the sharks are, and the police station in RE2.


**Least favorite**
The fucking castle in 4.



6.) Ironically, the first RE game I played was 3. But the first one I was really into was 4.



7.) For Wesker, either Monster by Skillet, or Animal I Have Become by Three Days Grace.



8.) I went as Ada once to a con, but I didn't like how the dress felt, and hated the wig.



9.) I'm all for LAda, but hate Cleon. And as much as I don't like to say it, I'd totally ship Carlos and Nicholai, as heterosexual as I see the both of them.



10.) The logical side of me says to choose Leon, Chris, and Dante(from Devil May Cry)

But my illogical side says to choose Wesker, Krauser, and still Dante. I feel like with those three we'd be unstoppable, but I'd probably end up dead in a matter of minutes.

Thinking that this is what he's been looking for Jake follows this trial. He ends up on a small island in the Barents Sea (north of Russia) and begins his search in a small town (more advanced than Pueblo). The towns people would be uninfected at first but a small group of BOWs sent to kill Jake would change that. The island also features and old Soviet era Gulag that serves as a hideout and test area for Alex Wesker. Since Alex Wesker has access to almost all bio-weapons in the series, we could see things like Tyrants, Hunters, Zombies and even some Ganando-like creatures. Or perhaps a combination of a few (T-virus + Plaga infection? It could happen). Jake would for the most part be on his own, with and optional co-op partner (one of his merc buddies maybe?) as well as another scenario featuring Ada or some other character.

If it already has I apologize. But...

If anyone has read the SD Perry Resident Evil books, you should notice that RE: Retribution and SD Perry's second original novel to the series, RE: Underworld share similar and almost exact general plot points.

(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)

RETRIBUTION
Retribution sees the characters go through Umbrella's training facility which features artificial versions of: suburbia, moscow, japan, and new york.  Alice and Ada travel together and set off to rendezvous with the rest of the team.

UNDERWORLD
Underworld features the characters infiltrating an umbrella facility in order to obtain a codebook to bring them down.  The group gets separated and has characters Leon and John fighting through umbrella's four artificial training facilities in order to meet up with the rest of the team.  They go through: forest, desert, mountain, and a city area.

This usually wouldn't surprise me but the books have gotten zero mention when it comes to the films.  But yeah, pretty cool stuff I guess.

TLDR: RE: Retribution and SD Perry's novel RE: Underworld share the same artificial training facility plotline.

Don't forget that this game in the series is set a year prior to the events in 5. So, Albert Wesker is still alive. Also, I'm not quite sure when the events with Jill in the Spencer mansion occurred in relation to this game, but Jill may be ""dead"" during the events of this game. 

Edit: Also, rumor has it there will be another unlockable Ada Wong mission.

Edit2: Seems IGN has heard that the partner of the unknown protagonist is Sherry. I will still, however, take that with a grain of salt only because of the evidence in the trailer. We'll see. I think that Hunk is the most obvious choice for the new guy on the block. Hunk is immune to the virus, so his blood is quite valuable, he was a merc, and he does look like he should. I'm still hoping for a return of Burnside or Alex Wesker and I really wonder who Chris's partner will be. Barry? Carlos? Billy? No, probably not, but here's hoping we at least hear something about these guys.

Resident Evil has to be one of the most complex games in terms of story. For years I have been eager to know more and simply just understand what was happening throughout these games.

Scouring the Internet for answers, I found [Thomas Wilde](http://stolisomancer.livejournal.com), a reviewer for several gaming sites. He, along with [Dan Birlew](http://www.danbirlew.com) (who started the project as a fan) have written a very thorough summary of what happened throughout RE, including what is canon and what is rubbish. [Here is the link](http://sites.google.com/site/stolisomancy/replot/replot.txt).

I highly recommend taking a look if you're eager for a better understanding of the history of Resident Evil, including all major and minor plot points, FAQs and more.

I'm used to RE not making much sense, but this is incredibly confusing when compared to the previous ones.

**Attack on Tall Oaks**

Why did Simmons want to silence the president? Was there anything about the Raccoon City incident left to go public with?

**Attacks in Edonia and China**

Did Carla try to destroy the world because Simmons turned her into his own personal Ada Wong? Where did she get the money and facilities? It's hinted that the chinese mob is working with her, but she's got submarines, underwater labs and an aircraft carrier!

**Simmons' rant at Ada**

Simmons was mad that Carla had used Jake's blood to enhance the C-virus - was he really trying to get Jake to help make a vaccine? Or just angry she did it before him? He also sent the mission regarding Jake's recruitment to Carla.. did he mean to ask Carla, or was he just confusing her with Ada?

**Pier's sacrifice**

Was there a reason why Piers decided to stay behind? I might have missed it. I mean, they know that Jake's blood can probably cure the C-Virus. He still had a chance to be human again, so..?

**Ada's motives**

So in the end, Leon's left confused once again and the BSAA thinks Ada Wong is responsible for everything. Why didn't Ada clarify that it was her evil clone? She had the evidence, but she decided to destroy it? What?

**Why did Simmons need Helena**

Okay, so Helena's in the SS, and that puts her close to the president. But Simmons was pretty much bionuking the town.

It feels sort of like Resident Evil II, with the environments and what not. Unlike Resident Evil 5 it pays to run away and conserve bullets then to shoot all the enemies. Best of all, they're actual zombies. 

Some demerits this far is the QuickTime events. Also the AI again.

1341652513.0,7,self.residentevil,w68do,My thoughts on Resident Evil: Code Veronica,Iconoclastik,10,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/w68do/my_thoughts_on_resident_evil_code_veronica/,"So at the start of this year I decided to rediscover all the gaming gems I missed out on when I was too young. I started out with RE4 on gamecube and was blown away. That game is just amazing imho. Anyway, impressed with my introduction to the RE franchise I thought I'd try all the older RE games which people on the net seem to enjoy more. So i picked up Code Veronica X on PS2 at my local EB for around $12. Here my impressions on the game, and I'd appreciate to hear everybody's thoughts. =) Sorry in advance if this is a long post.


First of all, I hadn't known survival horror until this game - everything that RE4 had tried to convince me was survival horror was blown out of the water. Collecting ammo, typewriting reels, frantically using herbs as soon as Claire went below ""Fine"" health and into ""Danger"" (limping heavily in the process). The gameplay was just phenomonal. I've ever been as frightened or spooked out as I was in CVX. Everything from the achingly slow loading screens of the opening doors, the heartbeats as I ascended a creaky staircase just clicked with me and I drank it all in.


Secondly atmosphere was amazing. The creepy piano melodies (especially in the Ashford Mansion ... oooh!) along with the rest of the audio in that game was fantastic, and I found myself using the run toggle less and less, walking slowly along a corridor, the camera panning alongside me with the terrfying sound of my footsteps echoing off the walls.


I also liked the puzzles and only once or twice felt as though something was too ambiguous - when I finally worked out how to open briefcases (by physically rotating them) I felt like both an idiot and a genius at the same time which I love in video games.. maybe I'm just weird like that.


However, there was one MAJOR gripe that I had with this game which completely broke the immersion whenever I encountered it - the freaking boss battles. They. Sucked. So hard. I got so frustrated whenever i had to fight a boss that I found my self swearing even more than I usually do. Let me explain.


The controls took a bit of getting used to but I quickly worked out that they suited the majority of the game perfectly. Navigating the levels, collecting items, it was suited those sections perfectly. But when I had to fight a boss the controls just ended up screwing me over as I tried to run around a boss and dodge his attacks. There were two moments where this happened - the fight you have with the monster that Alfred sets upon you in the plane, and the final battle against Alexia in her three phases. God, that last one gives me nightmares - trying to run around these fucking tentacles that kept running up to me and stabbing me, making me lose total control. If i was given a traditional, 3D video game control method in the boss battles, where I could turn and move without first having the rotate my character I feel like my enjoyment of those sections would have been immensely improved.


Secondly, I feel like the game took the whole 'survival' aspect waaay to far in regards to the boss battles. For instance, the previously mentioned battle on board the plane - the first time, I simply didn't have enough ammo on me to kill the thing, making me wonder if I was doing it right. Luckily, I had a previous save file that allowed me to load back, collect some ammo that I missed and waste the fucker in about 10 seconds. Same with Alexia's fight - I was forced to replay about an hour of gameplay just to scan the levels for hidden ammo and weapons.


Overall, Code Veronica X is up there as one of my most enjoyable video games I've ever had to play, and I'm eager to try the rest of the old-school RE's. It's just a shame that the (in my opinion) poorly designed and hastily implemented boss battles ruined what would otherwise have been a perfect experience for me.


Sorry about the long post, this my first post on reddit. I'd really appreciate some feedback on the issue that I outlined, and perhaps what you guys thought of the whole thing. Thanks all.

I purchased the new DLC that came out April 17th for ORC, and I like it. New stuff to do while I wait for RE6 to come out, AND it comes with more achievements. (I'm an achievement hunter with certain games XD)  
 For anyone who hasn't played it yet I will be fair.  
[I think they did an awesome job with how Sherry looks in the game on the last level. Everyone else they made look like shit, and it pisses me off. Carlos looked like he has downs syndrome the first glance at him in the one cutscene, and his face is kinda fat &gt;_&lt;.  I hoping the rest of the DLC will show Ada (maybe we can shoot at her too, that'd be nice XD), since the U.S.S had a run in with her, I have no doubt in my mind that Spec Ops will also. It'd be cool if they showed Ben lol XD Maybe like after he got mutated or something. I love how they brought in the different Hunters also which appeared to be a bit stronger. Maybe we could fight an alligator? That'd be awesome XD :) ](/spoiler)  
Another thing that pissed me off, was when I tried to do a private match on the Foundry level on Team Attack, my xbox would freeze, so would my friends. There has been times on regular versus where my game freezes and I have to manually turn off my xbox. I'm hoping they fix this with the new DLC, it's getting pretty annoying -.-  
My one friend lost all of his RE data from un installing the DLC and doing all this shit because on the last level after a certain cutscene, the game freezes for him and no matter what character he was, it would freeze. And now after uninstalling the game, somehow he lost all of his data, his guns and rank.

I must have been around thirteen, and it was absolutely awesome and scared me to bits, I particularly remember that bit on the plane being absolutely terrifying.

Then in 2007 I got RE 4 for the PC. I forgave the controls and playing this was even more memorable. I had moved into a student house, and this game saved me from utter boredom at times.

I got RE 5 for the 360 when it came out (2009?). Although it was a departure from the other games, I had a blast playing it, even though it was not scary. Last year I revisited it with my significant other and we played it twice A totally different but equally as good experience. We completed Mercanaries and I also loved the 'Lost in Nightmares' bundle, that was very tense.

Two months ago, I was contemplating playing 4 again, but to my surprise, CV and 4 were on the marketplace. I played them both again, with fond memories flooding back. I forgot how brilliantly dodgy the voice acting was in CV, and how good they both still were, even though CV was a bitch to control.

So, I've seen the trailer for 6, had my multiple orgasms, and am wondering if I should bother playing 1, 2 and 3 on PC, as I've had a great time with the last three games. Or has that ship sailed, and they're too dated?

Anything below 50 is below average while anything above is above average. With a large enough sample size, I can write up a review that represents the game from a typical user.

I have only finished Resident Evil 4/5 and 2 when I was much younger, but I remember barely anything about it.

Anyway, I want to go back and play all the RE games in the main series... 0-5 and Code Veronica. What I'd like to know is **what are the best systems to play the main series games on?**

Note: I don't really intend on re-purchasing any games I already own. I already have the following:

Code Veronica (PS2)
Resident Evil 2 (N64)
Resident Evil 4 (PS2)
Resident Evil 5 (360)

I have most every console but obviously some versions of the game are easier to track down than others... and for Resident Evil 0 there obviously isn't much of an option. I see the GC remakes have generally lower scores - is that because they are poor ports, or because reviewers thought the games hadn't aged well?

**TL;DR: Want to play the Resident Evil games. What is the best system for each game?**",,False,self,t5_2s0lb,False,,,True,t3_sgngq,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/sgngq/what_are_the_best_systems_to_play_re_on/,
1334695796.0,5,self.residentevil,sestj,Will we ever see the return of Steve/Krauser/Hunk/Carlos/Rebecca?,drupido,5,0,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/sestj/will_we_ever_see_the_return_of/,"I'm actually wondering... with the return of Sherry and the exposure gotten to these characters by the chronicles games, is there a chance we can see a return of one( or some) of these characters? 

According to Yasahiro Setu's Blog ""Talking Evil"" as well as Nintendo Power's Darkside Chronicles coverage, Jack Krauser is Setu's favorite Resident Evil Character. His appereance in the latest Mercenaries game makes me believe that there is a chance for a return of Krauser as an antagonist. Chris already has Wesker as a recurring antagonist, I was thinking now that both Leon and Ada are shown in RE6, Capcom could make him come back in some way. Even if it is a minigame.

STEVE...With the latest release of Code Veronica X (CV:HD for PSN and XBL) I was thinking it would make sense to mention him in some way at least. I mean... even Sherry is back, come on! His inclusion would make the most interesting inclusion of all the characters I mentioned as he had a cliffhanger ending in CV.

I am aware of HUNK's role in ORC, which makes his appearance in the next game highly unlikely, although I would still like him to appear as a playable character in mercenaries.

As far as Carlos I know it a looooong shot, since he is unlikely to ever appear again in a RE game. Nonetheless, all the hatered he has towards Umbrella by the end of RE2 shouldn't go to waste. I know he is unlikely to ever see a reappearance in an RE game though.

Now, to end this post, I would like to bring Rebecca to the spotlight. She is the only protagonist to appear in more than 1 game to not come back for a third game (maybe Claire if she didn't appear in Revelations). I think with 14 years of experience she could be a great character to play as or at least to have some kind of minor role in the sroty.

**SO I'm asking r/residentevil... what are your thoughts on this matter?**

EDIT: Forgot to mention Billy from RE 0.

After my recent (and reasonably successful) completion of Let’s Play Resident Evil 2, I decided to start Let’s Play Resident Evil 4! Current episodes available to watch are:

[Episode 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaijYwgbYBc)- Am I as scared as when I started RE2? More importantly- can I get the controls right this time?

[Episode 2]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=webZOSJ1bZU)- attacked by plenty of villagers and the scary chainsaw guy. Very traumatising.

[Episode 3]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQm-4pcpiRE)- We make ‘Leon sandwiches’!

[Episode 4]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3dREuwy3g0)- We meet the merchant for the first time before I get ambushed once again.

[Episode 5]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt83BSE7msY)- ‘The Trouble with Lagging’ special!

[Episode 6]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHmXT59nmT0)- Chainsaw man comes after me again, and I’m still just as traumatised as the first time round.

[Episode 7]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHmXT59nmT0)- We head off into the cemetery...

[Episode 8]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X2kQREbSmc)- I explain what I had to sacrifice in order to stop the emulator lagging...

[Episode 9](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_qrTIFdvU)- We face-off with Del Lago, the annoying fish.

I hope you enjoy the episodes as much as I enjoyed recording them. If you want to see more then feel free to subscribe to my Youtube, Facebook and Twitter channels. I regularly post Let’s Play’s on Youtube, including a completed Let’s Play of RE2!

I started playing ""all"" RE games (namely RE0,1,2,3,4,CVX,5, aswell as Darkside + Umbrella Chronicles) in anticipation for RE6. When I started up 0, I remembered something about ""the second Racoon City"" - Sheena Island. After googling it, RE: Gun Survivor came up. But it got me thinking - if Sheena Islands incident was so major that it was called the second Racoon City, how come that we know so little about it? 

There have been quite the amount of RE games handling the incident around Racoon City, but only Gun Survivor, one of the worst and least played RE games is about Sheena Island. Again, if it was so major, why isn't it more frequent? I could imagine some kind of reboot for Sheena Island in a new RE/DLC for RE6, but that is only speculation.

So /r/RE, what do you say? Why is SI so rare, especially considering that it was Umbrellas own Island where they produced the Tyrants? Will we see more of it or is it done for good?",,False,self,t5_2s0lb,False,,,True,t3_zm4ec,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/zm4ec/sheena_island/,

Seeing a few familiar faces in the right places was a nice touch, especially in the 2nd movie(Ashfords, Carlos,Nemesis) and seeing Claire Redfield at all was great in the 3rd (although she did feel forced in as did Chris in the 4th).

The Nemesis's voice, well all the players voices, they had the creepiest voice in 3 and they change it to some bs annoying voice, i mean why not just take the old voice?

2. The story everytime capcom wants to make money. Revalations took place before resident evil 5, and where was Parker Luciani in 5? story added and not supported in the latest one.

3. The gameplay depending on the character you play as. In six they said they are going to have seperate playing styles depending on the players, such as operation raccoon city gameplay for chris and resident evil 4 and 5 for leon. And probly a combonation for weskers brother i think. They should make the game a slow paced horror. This aint call of duty zombies.

4. The way zombies act. Its one thing to have a infected human use weapons and throw things but a t virus or c virus zombie that dosent have a brain throwing and hitting you with objects. No. All they have in there heads are food! Not lets just kill him.

5. Co-op! Resident evil is an alone game to scare people. I hate the fact that they have at ALL times a partner with you. In revalations they have a partner with you but he or she cant help you when your getting bit or thrown they just watch and shoot. Solo is the way to go in a resident evil game.

You can donate through the ChipIn widget which goes to my paypal which I would then put on her Avon page, or if you don't trust me(don't blame you for not trusting a stranger), you can donate directly at this page.

 ---Back In September UmbrellaSciences.com went up, which after about 30 seconds, the page would get hacked and have you check out a different page- InsertedEvil.com.  
 Week after week and so on, this guy named ""Ian Sider"" would have us track down clues he left all over the internet to help us expose the Umbrella Corporation. Now, I'm HUGE with this stuff. I created an OC that HATES Umbrella, and became obsessed. Especially when he replied back to me on twitter, AND retweeted something I said ""before Umbrella got to him"". I can't even begin to tell you how happy I was when he replied back to me, for I desperately want Capcom to notice how big of a fan I am of this amazing game I cannot get enough of. Yes, I'm still trying to find Ian Sider on the internet somewhere. When you come down to the final video, you'll see why.  
  ---Do I believe the last video? Hell no, I think Umbrella is just lying yet again, to try to scare us ""Resistance"" people away and to give up the fight. But I won't, And I believe that before the game is release he'll reveal the final clue.  
---Or who knows, perhaps he'll be in the game.  
 --The other thing about this awesome website, is that certain websites he leads you to, gives you clues about the game itself (Operation Raccoon City) and how to defeat certain BOWs. Now, Umbrella has a hold of his twitter (Twitter.com/InsertedEvil), but again, I still think the last video is BS on Umbrella/Vectors part. For a while I thought Chris Redfield was ""Ian Sider"", but now I've started thinking that perhaps the Insider is within the U.S.S, perhaps Vector or Spectre, one of the characters we've never seen, perhaps Vector because he ""found and killed Ian Sider"". Maybe Spectre because hes known for betraying the last company he worked for.

When O'brian was revealing that he was hiding things, what EXACTLY was he hiding? I think I wasn't paying close enough attention or missed it or something, but I can't figure out what it was.

The other thing i wanted to ask about is where this game takes places in relation to the other ones, during the closing sequences they show jill and chris going to a mansion (the mansion from RE1?) 

Did chris and jill go back to the mansion after the events of the first game, or is this capcom hinting they might be remaking the original? 

Anyway, thanks everyone.

now, on to raid mode.....

EDIT: (look at me learning how to use reddit) I've figured out that this takes place between 4 and 5, The only thing I'm having trouble figuring out is the mansion bit (besides o'brian's involvement) because wasn't the mansion destroyed at the end of the first game?",,False,self,t5_2s0lb,True,,,True,t3_prdvv,http://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/prdvv/first_post_questions_and_spoilers_and_other/,
