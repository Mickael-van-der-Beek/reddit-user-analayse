He claims they're considering it, but need support from Sony and 2k, and even encouraged me to write in so:

SCEA PR email:  scea_media_hotline@playstation.sony.com

2k PR email:  pr@2kgames.com

here are the emails to the PR depts at 2k and Sony. no idea if PR would be able to do jack, but they were the only non-support emails i could find. I also snail mailed my emails to:

2k Games

10 Hamilton Landing

Novato, California

94949 United States

and

SCEA

919 East Hillsdale Blvd, 2nd floor

Foster City, CA 94404

the SCEA address is their HR dept, but it was the easiest address to find on short notice. If anyone else has tips or ideas (or better contact info), lets hear em!

[EDIT] Wow, this is going great! Remember to send word of this to your favorite gaming site/blog. so we can try to get some more exposure!

1345375718.0,334,self.vita,ygwhr,"ATTENTION ALL GAMERS! *WE* HAVE THE POWER TO BRING BORDERLANDS 2 TO THE PS VITA! PLEASE, PLEASE READ:",LeatherFeathers,428,94,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/ygwhr/attention_all_gamers_we_have_the_power_to_bring/,"Borderlands 2 for PS Vita.

Background information: Randy Pitchford is the CEO of Gearbox Software, the makers of the Borderlands (a friggin' awesome cel shaded FPS). At a recent Indie game conference (Rezzed) he said that he would love to bring the new Borderlands 2 onto the vita. 

Saying: ""I want to be able to have the character I'm working on with my PS3, and then when I'm on the road with my Vita I can just keep developing that same character because it exists on the cloud somewhere.""

However they are currently tied down into creating it for PC and consoles. Pitchford also said: ""We're too busy to develop it ourselves. But I know there are a lot of talented developers who could take our code, our source and our content and perhaps create something like that. That would be exciting to me."" 

Since then three (not sure which ones) developer studios have approached Gearbox Software asking to create the Vita version of their massive hit game (the first borderlands sold over 2,500,000 copies) .

Since then he has said that he needs some help from Sony to push this forward, his exact words: “Perhaps some of you folks can convince Sony to start that,” 

We must show them that we, the community want this to happen! If we show support they will show support for us handed, not just now but in the future! We must contact Sony through any way possible -

Bombard their Twitter! - https://www.twitter.com/PlayStation

Bombard their Facebook! - http://www.facebook.com/PlayStation

Thanks to FlameAtNight here is 2k's (the publisher) contact page: http://www.take2games.com/contact/
 
Please! This is a call out to all communities! Including PC, Xbox and PS3! The vita community is currently too small! We need your help, maybe someday we can repay you?

I am currently working on trying to contact Randy Pitchford to inform him of the situation. Please tell your mates, go on Twitter and ask major PS Vita tweeters to join our worthy cause!

If Borderlands 2 comes to the Vita it will probably revive PS Vita sales, meaning more content for all Vita owners.

Please bear this in mind, even if you don't want Borderlands (for some strange reason :p)

Thank you, God speed.

Edit: Well done everyone! If we can keep this up we will get through eventually! I have been working to get through all afternoon but have not recieved a reply. The r/gaming post is not doing so well so if you want other than just our Vita gamers to know about it then please support this page: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/yh58c/attention_all_gamers_we_have_the_power_to_bring/ 

Update: Everything is going great! Let's keep this up! Thanks to thatoneguy42 from the previous thread we have the SCEA PR email address if you also want to email them- scea_media_hotline@playstation.sony.com

I am still working on trying to get through to Randy Pitchford and will tell you when I have!

Someguy asked how this post is different from the earlier ones. A: Because he has now officially said that he is willing to do it and has said that he needs our help! Keep going!

Hate all the pointless pictures,shruber,323,96,120,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1bil55/love_this_sub_hate_all_the_pointless_pictures/,"This sub is great.  There is tons of relevant news, rumors and information pertaining to vita hardware, accessories, and games.  My only issue is all the posts that add nothing in the form of discussion or information.  I feel like every time someone gets a new game (or is looking for karma) they post a picture of it.  Just get vita?  Post a picture.  And because they pictures get upvoted, it encourages other to do it as well.  Then everyone has to navigate around this pictures to get to any good content.  Would it be possible to create a separate subreddit where people can post pictures of their games and their newly purchased vita?  

Maybe I am just a crab ass, but this bugs me and I wanted to see how many others are annoyed by this.  I know people will say, ""if you don't like it, do not upvote it and ignore it"".  This attitude seems to always lead to a sub going to shit.  There is moderation for a reason, and I feel like this is a case that calls for some.

If everyone loves looking at pictures of vitas (even though you have your own) and games, then I will crawl back into my corner of the internet and not say another word about it.  I am just hoping for a little discussion for the sake of this great subreddit.


Edit1:  Well the people have spoken, they like the pictures.  Like I said, just wanted to see what people thought.

r/Vita stands as one of the most stylish, informative, and genuinely kindhearted subreddits that I've ever seen.

There is rarely ever a ""bad post"". Maybe some useless ones that ask questions with easily Google-able answers, but they come and go. 

Like many of us, I have been here since the very beginning. I remember my joy tearing open my First Edition Bundle from Amazon, and how awesome it was to play Uncharted on it.

Being a part of this budding community has been an amazing experience. Now, we're nearing the beginning of December, and to the extent of my knowledge, all of this year's biggest titles are out now. 

I think we should take the time to appreciate all of the work the moderators have done, from making the subreddit look as amazing as it does, changing the images on the little Vita on the sidebar every week, supporting us and keeping us informed with podcasts and weekly updates, and making us feel like a part of something spectacular despite the fact that many of us may not have seen anyone else in real life with a Vita up to this point.

I'm sure IceBreak has lost a substantial part of his life designing this subreddit... and who can forget the emotional and psychological sacrifices BlueMaxima makes when he plays games like Pinky Spots Leg Massage?

Several years ago I quit a director position at Treyarch|Activision working on their *Spider-Man* games just so I could go indie, and it's been a bumpy ride. 

But my first Vita game just launched: *sixty second shooter Deluxe*! And people seem to be really digging it.

I used Sony's Playstation Mobile tech to make it happen - which means anybody can do it, and I thought y'all might want to ask me about it. (Plus I wanted to try out this reddit thing.)

PSM dev has a lot in common with XNA Game Studio - C#, a pretty nice library and API. It's been a few years since I worked with XNAGS (I did the game *Schizoid* for XBLA) but there are a few things I like about PSM better:

 * garbage collection hitches haven't been an issue
 * font systems are built in (using their 2D engine API) - no digging up someone else's bitmap font code
 * the Vita is cool

So, yeah, anything you want to know?

At the beginning of January, [my brother Adam and I](http://sfbgames.com/) released our first Playstation Mobile game, [Haunt the House: Terrortown](http://hauntthehouse.com/). We've had [some](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-17-haunt-the-house-terrortown-review) [nice](http://www.psnstores.com/review/review-haunt-the-house-terrortown/) [things](http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Haunt+the+House%3A+Terrortown/review.asp?c=47868) written about the game, including some lovely comments [right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/169hu5/my_and_my_brothers_game_haunt_the_house/)!

I've found myself with a lot more spare promo codes than I thought I'd have, so I'd like to give away some copies, 20 sounds like a good number to me. To enter, just comment here! 24 hours after I post this, I'll run the thread through redditraffle.com and pick 5 winners. Then 5 more each on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Winners can't win again though. [/r/RandomActsOfGaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/) rules suggest to only accept accounts over a month old, so I'm going with that as a rule too. If you don't want to enter but want to comment, just include the word ""nowin"" in your comment.

Also, a quote from the /r/RandomActsOfGaming rules: ""IF you comment and enter a contest please be sure to upvote the post for two reasons. 1: As a small and VERY easy way of thanking the OP for doing such a kind and selfless act. 2: Give the post more acknowledgement on Reddit. It does NOT lower your chances of winning in most cases."". So don't be afraid to upvote, if you want to of course!

You should be aware that while the game works on the Vita, Playstation Mobile itself is only available in the following countries: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia and Japan. If you don't have a PSN account from one of those countries, I can't get a copy to you, sorry! Here's hoping Sony will open it up to more countries soon...

Good luck!

It seems to stem from the ""Use WiFi In Power Save Mode"" under the Power Save Settings. The wording on that option *seems* to indicate that if checked, it would allow WiFi use while in sleep mode. 

The *actual* meaning seems to be that it will do the opposite. 

So if you are having trouble with downloads pausing after your Vita goes to sleep for a while, turn **OFF (uncheck)** that setting. 

For the record, I also tried the other standard replies to this problem and they didn't work (letting it sleep by itself, leaving the music app up, keeping it on the charger, etc).

Square Enix hasn't really been supporting the Vita in ways that it supported the PSP or continues to support the 3DS. The CEO of Square Enix, Phil Rogers has left his email in a blog telling fans to contact him with feedback. I think this would be an opportune time for Vita fans to contact him and let him know that we want new original games from some of the big names. 
 
The Vita would be perfect for games like Final Fantasy, Deus Ex, Tomb Raider, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts, and so  on.  
 
Here's the Blog post he left to fans along with his email and contact info: http://eu.square-enix.com/en/blog/note-phil-rogers-ceo
 
It would be great if we could get as many Vita fans as possible to send kind letters, letting him know that there is a community begging for big name titles that can only be found on the Vita. Make sure the subject of the email says something to the effect of: 
 
""A Fan Reaching Out About The Vita"" - We don't want to spam the same subject each time, but make sure he knows it's about Vita support. 
 
Games sell systems, which in turn cause more game support to reach the system.

Shaw-han's set was incredibly rad with some crazy generative visualizations he's been working on.  Philippe Lemarchand rocked it so hard (Phil Fish and Richard Lemarchand's stage name).

Basically I just wanted to say I had the most incredible feeling last night of vindication for my craft and the first thing I thought was ""I should thank everyone on reddit because they have been super supportive"".

This isn't from Sony or Queasy but just a random dude who makes games that happens to lurk reddit now and then and is blown away that work he's done has landed him in such amazing places with crazy cool people.

THANK YOU!

*PS: I am definitely still drunk from last night*

##Share your custom Vita wallpapers here.

Things to consider when making wallpapers:

* Scaling of .jpg images works fine but .png images need to be the proper resolution.

* Vita game screenshots make good wallpapers.

* Tiered sets like [HorizonShadow's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/q3i8b/i_made_a_tomb_raider_wallpaper_set_for_you_guys/) work quite well on the Vita. ([tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqgZlqLAbQ8))

* The resolution for the Vita is 960 x 544.

* The Vita will scale images to around 100kb, so keep that mind for compression purposes.

* Any 16x9 wallpaper 960 x 544 or larger will work just fine as long as it's .jpg.

* Icon text is somewhat difficult to read on a white background.

* The lockscreen (start screen) will have the time in big white text to the left.

* **Please use [imgur](http://imgur.com) for your uploads.**

Here's what I thought about them.,grome45,107,12,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/13wvq5/rvita_i_bought_the_joystick_grips_heres_what_i/,"Hi guys. Some of you might have been in the chat yesterday when I said I was getting the joystick grips (these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007IDIXBK/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00) today. I did. 

So here's what I think of them:
I've been playing Unit 13 with them, and while they don't improve the aiming too much, they feel much more natural than the regular vita ones. And this comfort is what helps somewhat improves aiming a little.
Take in mind that they won't change a whole lot. They improve the experience a little bit. If you've got $7 dollars, I say buy them. These with the CTA grip will probably make gaming with the vita more comfortable. But if you don't have the $7, don't worry...you're not missing a must-need accesory for the Vita.

I hope this clears up some doubts. And feel free to ask me questions about them, or for those who do have them, tell us what you think.

The town post office was one of the buildings hit.

[cross post from /r/games],DoubleJumps,110,16,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1czoy9/false_advertising_alert_guilty_gear_on_the_vita/,"Arc system works revealed on their twitter, after people started to notice that the version of Guilty Gear released on the psn today did not have online play, that it does NOT have online play. Which the trailer strongly led people to believe.
Here are some pictures of the segment from the trailer advertising online modes, and the tweet. http://imgur.com/a/KUvIH
EDIT: Also of note is that the store page for the game on psn solidifies the idea that there is online play, showing pictures of what looks like a multiplayer lobby, and advertising ""Network Battle Mode."" Ad-Hoc multiplayer is probably what they meant, but Network Battle Mode is poor wording when you only mean local play, on an online service that is called the Playstation Network.
So, anyone who was considering this game, look out. Might not be what you were expecting.

EDIT:  04/24 - Arc System Works has removed the trailer that advertised online modes and uploaded a hastily edited variation of the japanese trailer.  This is how it looks now.

##Share your custom Vita wallpapers here.

Things to consider when making wallpapers:

* Scaling of .jpg images works fine but .png images need to be the proper resolution.

* Vita game screenshots make great wallpapers.

* Tiered sets like [HorizonShadow's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/q3i8b/i_made_a_tomb_raider_wallpaper_set_for_you_guys/) work quite well on the Vita. ([tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqgZlqLAbQ8))

* The resolution for the Vita is 960 x 544.

* Any 16x9 wallpaper 960 x 544 or larger will work just fine as long as it's .jpg.

* Icon text is somewhat difficult to read on a white background.

* The lockscreen (start screen) will have the time in big white text to the left.

* **Please use [imgur](http://imgur.com) for your uploads.**

An in-game timer! For those of us that get deeply wrapped up into our games and lose track of time, an occasional pop-up reminder can help pause a game session. All you have to do is start wake up club, set an alert for when you want to stop playing by (I use the non-online alarm), then background the app, then jump back into whatever game you want to play. When the alarm goes off, a small notification will pop up.

Off the top of my head I recall people have posted here who have worked on:

* Oddworld games
* Guacamelee and Mutant Blobs
* Haunt the House
* Velocity
* Switch Galaxy
* (and of course) Sound Shapes

I know I'm forgetting some, I just have a terrible memory.  Maybe it's because the sub is small and the developers are less hidden but I just feel like they post here more than anywhere else.

So!  If you're a Vita dev, post something here and let us know what you worked on.  For no other reason than I'd like to tag you, really.

Or maybe you're a dev for another platform or a hobbyist?  You can post, too!  I know quite a few people here have fiddled about with PSM.",,False,self,t5_2sjmv,False,,game-soundshapes,True,t3_1i2xr2,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1i2xr2/who_here_is_a_game_developer_vita_and_otherwise/,

First off you should know that ninja gaiden is without a doubt one of the hardest games of all time (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jluv2HxFEqs). This is amplified further if you've never played this type of genre before. So expect to die, a lot.


----Defense----


Your bread and butter for avoiding damage will be block (left trigger). It'll completely negate nearly every single enemy attack in the game, if not reduce the damage. 


So you're thinking, oh easy enough, why would I die in this game if I can just block until I see an opening. Well like I said it stops almost all attacks. 


Enemies generally have 3 types of attacks, those you can block fully, those that remove your block temporarily (i.e. strong attacks) and grabs, which completely ignore the fact you're blocking. As to which specific enemy has which attack will be up to you to learn.


Your second line of defense is rolling. This is done by holding the left trigger and moving the left stick. This is what you will be using to negate strong attacks and avoid grabs. To negate a strong attack using roll, first you must be struck by a strong attack (an attack that leaves you open for attack by other enemies) and then immediately rolling afterwards. This may take some getting used to, the moment you see Ryu thrown off his balance by an attack is when you want to roll. This sort of ""resets"" Ryu's block, if you will, so you're no longer in the open and are back to blocking. Avoiding grabs is all about paying attention to all enemies on screen. If you notice one of them walking up to you or trying to jump behind you, you best be rolling out of the way because blocking will do nothing at all for you.


Note 1:  rolling and jumping is much faster than merely running as Ryu. This is good for allowing you to set up for easier kills (by getting you to your position faster), avoiding damage and generally moving through the game faster.


----Offense----


So you've learned the art of not taking damage, how do you return the favour your enemies tried to bestow upon you?


The number one thing for a good offense in this game is positioning. Just because you avoided the first enemy's attacks doesn't mean you should just start swinging your sword. You have to get yourself in a spot where while you're pulling off combos an enemy won't just interrupt you, which not only stops your offense but obviously hurts you as well. This just comes with learning enemy move sets, knowing what weapon you're using and the techniques it has.


The weapon you have equipped makes a pretty huge difference. Overall you're going to have your cutting type weapons (i.e. dragon sword), blunt weapons (dabilahro) and 2fast2furious weapons (nunchaku). Every weapon in the game has it's own moveset list, though some overlap for certain weapons, which you'll have to learn (it also increases as you level them up) and it's own 1&amp;2 ultimate technique (even this sometimes changes depending on the weapon's level). On the whole, dragon sword will be your most used weapon, though I seriously recommend trying every weapon out because some weapons are without a doubt better against some enemies/bosses either due to their techniques or ultimate techniques.


What is this ultimate technique he keeps talking about? Well when you kill enemies you notice they leave behind either green, blue or red orbs. If you hold down triangle you will notice Ryu goes into a charging state where he can absorb those orbs and perform ultimate techniques. Ultimate techniques is a move you pull off depending on how ""many"" orbs you sucked in. I say ""many"" because an UT can either be a 1 or 2, and greens count for 1 whereas blue and red count for 2 (if you absorb a green and a blue it'll still count as 2, as that's the maximum). When Ryu pulls off an ultimate technique he is invincible and deals considerable damage AND enemies killed by your ultimate technique always drop green orbs that are much more valuable than if you had just killed them with a regular technique, which means more money to spend at the blacksmith.


Note 2: You can be interrupted pretty easily charging your UT, and orbs absorbed for this are lost, so make sure you can pull it off without getting hit.


Note 3: You can also charge your UT without orbs, but it takes considerably long, so do so with extreme caution.


Note 4: Make sure you upgrade those weapons!


Note 5: To use ninpo hit triangle and circle at the same time, then you'll notice circles you need to tap, but it's not on the touch screen, but on the back of the vita where you tap.


Note 6: To dive underwater: while in water hold down the x button.


----End----


I'm gonna stop it here as I think I covered just the general scope of how to play Ninja Gaiden, and you should seriously take time learning about everything else yourself. I hope this was at least remotely helpful.


Also don't hesitate to message me on either psn or here for tips/help.

The game is styled after the point-and-click adventure games I played as a kid. You play a young girl who, after an annoying day at school, just wants some peace and quiet. But everything in the house is conspiring against her. The neighbor is obsessively mowing his lawn, Dad is channel surfing and Mom is yapping on the phone. Her pesky kid brother won't go to bed, and even her pet kittens are driving her crazy.

Here are some screenshots:

And here is a gameplay video I cobbled together from ""Let's Play"" videos people posted on youtube of themselves playing the Xbox version of the game:

Fucking Hell.,Inspector_Jones,103,34,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/18wfwf/dropped_vita_on_concrete_today_fucking_hell/,"GODDAMNIT! I take care of my Vita like it's a newborn baby, and today when I went to go put it into my pocket, I was unaware that my ""pocket"" was in actuality a hole in my piece of shit sweater I put on.

When I heard something crash and hit the floor, I couldn't comprehend what the fuck just happened. Then I saw my Vita on the concrete, screen facing up with my bright yellow Persona 4 skin, and in just that second, my day was ruined. 

Luckily, the OLED screen came out pristine, since it landed it's back side and didn't flip or anything,  but the back touch panel is now ""adorned"" with quite a few small scratches, and the curves on the outside of it are chipped to hell (near the hand/finger grips). 

While I doubt that I'll lose any functionality of the device (I was a bit relieved at how little damage there was compared to my fears), my Vita has gone from near pristine to slightly battered in a span of 5 seconds and a stupid oversight. 

Oh well, I needed to just vent. I'm going to go burn my sweater now.

Not only were they doing everything they could to get the line in and out of the store as quickly as possible, but as soon as I asked for a vita package and P4G, the guy behind the counter began talking about how amazing the game is. I stated how excited I had been for it, and how I was a little depressed about not being able to pre-order the solid gold edition. The guy behind the counter opens up the drawer and says ""well, we got a few extra of these in if it's any consolation"" and pulls out the skin for the system. (which also has the link for the wallpapers =D) So, to that Gamestop employee, thanks for being awesome. Also, P4G will now be my timesink. I'm only 2 hours in, and I can safely say I'm addicted.

Not if you don't like it, or if it's against your personal taste. We have enough problems with circlejerkers and rabid downvoters already.

Now let's have a giant list of questions that are asked way too much and should probably not be asked.

**Can I pirate games/install CFW/use emulators/homebrew...**

No. We do not support piracy in any way. Any post made about this will be either removed or downvoted into obscurity.

**Will Vita get PS2 games?**

There are no plans. Sony has directly stated that they do not plan to emulate the PS2 due to the Vita's lack of power.

**Is ""X"" game coming out in ""X"" region?**

Use Google, it will most likely get you your answer faster.

**When is ""X"" game coming out?**

Use Google or find a website that indexes release dates. A few people like [the Vita page on GameFAQs](http://www.gamefaqs.com/vita)

**Is the Vita region free?**

The Vita games are region-free, but you cannot buy DLC on a different PS Store region and expect it to work.

As an example, you're an Australian and you've imported a copy of Uncharted Golden Abyss from America. You can play the game just fine, but if you try to buy the map DLC for it, it won't work on your copy. If you want the DLC to work, you'll have to make a new American PSN account.

**Do I need a memory card?**

Yes. Most games won't save without them. 4GB will be enough if you're planning on going purely physical cards.

**What games/accessories do you recommend?**

We get that question a lot here. For just broad ""what should I buy"" questions, please use the Reddit search bar to look for ""recommendations"" and you'll find 10 people who have asked the same questions. For something more specific (say, best games for $10) feel free to post if you don't find anything during your search.

**What PSP games can be transferred via PS3?**

[This thread on Cheap Ass Gamer is quite brilliant at keeping track of things.](http://www.cheapassgamer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=316058)

**I don't like the bubbles, will Sony go back to XMB?**

Probably not. Sorry, but the Vita bubble interface is actually quite usable.

**Can I sell/trade here?**

No. /r/gameswap has more security measures on trades than we do. Feel free to try there.

**Can I share my Vita PSN account with another person/Vita?**

From what I know, you can only share with one other Vita, and both Vitas can't be online on PSN at the same time. Attempt at your own risk, know it probably will not work.

**Is a Vita for me / Should I buy a Vita / etc.?**

You should try examining the Vita more. Go read more reviews. Go watch more footage. If you're positively stumped, then post.

**I really want X game on Vita!**

nEmoGrinder, one of the developers of the Vita game Sound Shapes, [made a very good answer to this question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/108xjb/just_dawned_on_me_but_why_isnt_this_game_on_the/c6bi6fi)

**WiFi vs WiFi + 3G?**

3G is kinda useless on the Vita right now. The Vita's browser is crap and most games won't work over 3G. Not to mention most modern-day phones are capable of being Wi-Fi hotspots. If you have a phone that can do that you might as well avoid the 3G Vita.

**Can I play ""X"" through Remote Play?**

Only a handful of games and the PSone classic library works through Remote Play. You're much more likely to have a game not work. It's pathetic, we know.

**Please don't complain about occasional downvotes...**

If you have a question or need help of some sort (that isn't listed in this post), please don't complain if you get a few downvotes or your post ends up in the negative. The new queue is browsed frequently and it's rare for even the most mundane post to go without a few responses. But those posts don't do a lot good on the front page of the subreddit once answered since they're generally common knowledge. It's also important to note that self-posts (text only, no link) do not accrue karma.

Also, there are a few knuckleheads who will sometimes downvote a few things out of spite. They somehow think that being wronged in a similar manner means they have to continue to perpetuate the cycle. It's best just to ignore them as this is a common problem for quite a few smaller subreddits and it's just a couple anonymous dbags.

Finally, be polite in your posts and comments. No trolling or we'll remove the posts (or you'll be downvoted, take your pick). And before you post, use Google and Reddit search! You might just find your answer.",,False,self,t5_2sjmv,1355198563.0,,game-hotlinemiami1,True,t3_xmt57,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/xmt57/heres_a_general_guide_of_how_everyone_should/,moderator

1365283201.0,63,self.vita,1btejq,One week ago I traded my 3DS XL for a PS Vita. Here are my thoughts.,Domo91,86,23,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1btejq/one_week_ago_i_traded_my_3ds_xl_for_a_ps_vita/,"So, as the title says, last week I traded my 3DS Xl for a near mint Vita. I have played a LOT of it this past week, and I love this little thing. It is better in almost every way compared to the 3DS, but still has some issues. Here is my list of praises and complaints.

-The screen is WAY better compared to the 3DS. Not perfect, but much nicer
-The L and R triggers don't make my hand cramp up
-The fluidity of the entire system is much much better, it is really a night and day difference to me
-Two analog sticks is so awesome on a handheld. 
-PlayStation Plus is kick ass! Seriously, the few games I downloaded will last me a long while!
-The games really are console quality

But...
-The screen is a dust and finger print magnet!
-Even though the 3DS only had one analog stick, I loved the feel of it, and it seemed it had more freedom to move around. The Vita does not give you much room to move the sticks
-The back touch pad is pure gimmick (too be fair, so was the 3D. it was not as impressive as I hoped)
-Vita memory cards are way too overpriced. As soon as I made this deal, I was instantly set back 65$ for a 16gb memory card.
-Battery life seems worse than the 3DS, even with brightness and volume down all the way.
-Not all PS1 games are compatible with the Vita
-The L and R trigger feel like they are so loose

Overall, I am really happy I made the switch. No console is perfect. Each has strengths and weaknesses. The Vita is a great piece of hardware, it is too bad that Sony has yet to put a price drop yet, I want this console to flourish. Also, I can't wait to hear about more titles coming out, we need more shooters!

Thanks for reading! 

EDIT: Forgot to mention, I absolutely HATE how cross buy games do not share trophies. Would that not make so much sense for games like PSASBR, Jetpack Joyride, Sly, retro city rampage, and all those games that are the exact same on either console, to share trophies instead of having to do things twice? 

But anyways, thanks for the tips and such guys! Very informative!

The game feels almost like the console version of AC. The controls are pretty much the same, this version uses the touchscreen a little bit mostly for combos and choosing weapons. There are some bugs in the game where the heroine kinda teleports herself around when running through the rooftops or combating enemies, but I guess this should be handled with a patch (I already downloaded a patch, but it didn't fix this), the music is pretty good and makes you involved in the game, but the sound quality is not so good, so I guess you guys should use headphones to experience the music and sound effects.

The graphics are actually pretty good and detailed, it's not on par with the console version but they did a good job. Unfortunately there are some slowdowns with the FPS when running around and fighting a lot of enemies, I think this is normal for a game this size, since the city is enormous and full of life and small details. 

Storywise it's interesting, I've barely progressed since I've been busy exploring the city and running all over the place. It's a typical AC story with nice historic details behind it.

In my opinion this game is pretty good, not a perfect example of AC, but it feels like a full console experience. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, so I have no idea how it works. I would say that this is one of my favourite Vita games so far, can't wait for other similar games that are not dumbed down versions of big franchises.

I highly recommend it.

P.S. The game comes in all major European languages, you can chose each language inside the options menu. ",Review,False,self,t5_2sjmv,1351326015.0,review,ps,True,t3_124eaq,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/124eaq/i_received_my_copy_of_assassins_creed_iii/,

1336828950.0,59,self.vita,tjlx8,"There's nothing wrong with ports, HD collections or remakes on the Vita. If anything, they're beneficial.",BlueMaxima,73,14,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/tjlx8/theres_nothing_wrong_with_ports_hd_collections_or/,"There are several reasons for this.

* **Draws in new customers who haven't played classics before.** I hear so many people saying that ""blah blah I don't want ports of old games I want NEW GAMEZ"". Your experience with gaming is unique. A lot of people will enjoy playing their old games again.  A lot of people may not have played a specific series, and picking them up on a platform like the Vita is a win for them and a win for us. As a personal example, I had never played Persona before the remake on PSP, and it definitely made me interested enough to get Persona 4. Nostalgia and cluelessness wins out in a lot of situations.

* **Teams and studios gain experience on the new platform.** Porting a game is a great way to figure out how much the Vita can handle, and what sort of tricks you can use to push it to it's maximum potential. It's also a great way to gauge the games you can make on a Vita, with it's many input options and it's power the developers can figure out what they want to do with it, tinkering around while making their port.

* **Generates numbers and information companies can use to measure interest.** A ported game onto a new platform can show how interested a community is in games for said platform. Developers can use sales figures to show how people are willing to buy and play Vita games. It doesn't get much simpler than that.

* **Made quickly and generates profit very easily.** With a simple 1:1 port, you can effectively cut out more than half of a development team and cut a lot of time in building the port, mainly because most of the work is done for you (storylines are built, assets are available and gameplay mechanics are black and white). While some dev teams will bring on members to up-res art and resources, and programmers may introduce new mechanics and control options, it's still a lot cheaper than starting from scratch.",Opinion,False,self,t5_2sjmv,False,default,game-hotlinemiami1,True,t3_tjlx8,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/tjlx8/theres_nothing_wrong_with_ports_hd_collections_or/,

We have more rules for these threads than others as we want to provide these as an ongoing tool for the next year. As such, a couple things to keep in mind:

* If you're going to post a game title, **ensure someone else hasn't posted it first**. We'll delete any duplicate games to keep the thread clean.
* If it is indeed appropriate to post a game title, ensure you **only post the game title itself** - not lists, additional comments, etc. We'll delete those as well. Save the comments for the replies - you can post an entire essay as a reply if you'd like, in fact it is encouraged. :)
* Don't post an obscene number of games attempting to karma whore. You're free to post one or two, but let others share in the love.
* **Don't downvote games**, there's just absolutely no need for that. Vote up the games you recommend, and leave it at that please.

After the new year, we'll summarize our top winners for certain simple categories.

**EDIT: PLEASE ONLY REPLY DIRECTLY TO THIS THREAD WITH THE TITLE OF THE GAME AND NOTHING ELSE** (and do not bold or italicize).  All other direct replies that are not solely unique game titles will be removed.

###Notes

* Do not get you hopes up.  This is Japan conference in Japanese that will likely only cover Japanese games.
* It also sounds like it's just a pre-recorded video.

***

###Major News

* **The PS Vita is receiving a price drop in Japan from ¥24,980 (~$269) to ¥19,980 (~$215).**  This probably means a drop to $199 in the West will be coming Wednesday at PlayStation Meeting 2013.
* FFX Vita still coming.

***

###NeoGAF Translated Conference Details ([link](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=513919))

Yet, I need to mention the elephant in the room: Vita's global sales figures suck (Many have advised to wait a year before passing judgement, and we're almost there), and it's gotten to the point where there are only a few announced games on the horizon (Muramasa, Soul Sacrifice, Sly Cooper, Tearaway, and a few other randoms). Square Enix is too scared to commit Type-0 for release, and Bioshock Infinite is MIA.

Firstly, if this isn't allowed, just let me know and I'll remove it quickly.

It would seem 4.45 is bricking many user's PS3s, leaving them at the ribbon screen just after the PS3 logo. Affected users will note this screen does not advance, nor can you turn off your PS3 normally. One user I've seen has noted that he/she cannot open the PS3's safe mode screen, either.

Please hold off on updating until Sony fixes this, and if you use Automatic Update, you should disable it for the time being also.",,False,self,t5_2sjmv,1371617906.0,,game-ac1,True,t3_1gmudz,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1gmudz/not_vita_but_for_those_of_you_with_ps3s_do_not/,

* **The announcement bar has been changed.** (Basically ripped straight from /r/ community.)  It should no longer be harmful to people whose windows are squeezed tight as there should be enough padding for 2 lines of text.

* **Specific game threads have been removed from the menus at the top.**  The menus at the top have been adjusted and official threads won't be linked directly but instead search result sorted by the newest.  There hasn't been a new one in a while and the sidebar is pretty full as is.  If someone is interested in making a resistance one, I'm sure there would be interested in it.  I'll probably make one for Gravity Rush.

* **A tooltip has been added when downvoting comments.**  The effect this may have will likely be minimal at best.  I just wanted to show those who might not know that downvoting dissenting opinions isn't really what reddit's about.  (hint: It goes away if you remove the downvote.)

* **New user flairs!** - Some PS Logos, Trophies and a couple of game flairs have been added to the options.  Feel free to change up or keep it the same.

* **Extra safe spoiler tags.** This was a week ago or so but I just want to reiterate that the spoiler tags have changed.  Users are now protected from inbox replies and not using the subreddit stylesheet when the tags are used properly.  If you get one in your inbox or don't use the stylesheet, just hover over the spoiler link and it will be in the tool-tip popup.  

****

Also, if folks are interested, I will take custom flairs submitted by users.  There are four requirements they need to meet:

* (16px x 16px) 72dpi 
* Transparent .png file
* PlayStation Vita Related
* And somewhat clear what it is.  Half the ones I tried make were too hard to discern at that resolution.

If you want to give it a go, feel free to [message me](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=icebreak) with the results.  

Finally, if you have some *workable* suggestions for the site, let me know.

I may be overreacting but let me try and point this out to you:


1. PSVitaHub.com links keep getting submitted to the Subreddit even though it's a new and rather unpopular blog at this point in its' life.

2. Nearly all links are posted from the same user, Cool-H

3. The website is nothing but sensationalist. Most of their ""stories"" are opinion based or are not really news.

4. After checking PSVitaHub's YouTube page it becomes a bit more clear that the website is mostly sensational. They have a video for a ""leaked"" Call of Duty 4 on the Vita. 


What I am basically gathering from this is that the site is trying to do what it can to come up with content, even going as far as creating logo-stamped videos to increase hits to the site. The site itself isn't being shared by the community, it's from the same person. The site doesn't have any news that you can't find on a more accredited website. Creating ""leaked"" videos to generate traffic is just dirty.


As for how to react? I am not sure. If anyone has further proof of Blog spam or anything please help out. I know news is few and far between these days but I would rather this young and small Subreddit be filled with discussion rather then advertisement. If I am wrong, I apologize, I just want to point this out to anyone who may or may not know.

I'm Litesh0w. I'm a fairly active member here and some of you know me by my Psn name as Pikapuu. 

Anyway this post is here because of the amount of up votes my comment has on BlueMaxima's thread on the 10k subs question. 

My comment or rather, Idea is: for members of R/vita to make a wallpaper for their vita then set that wallpaper as your start screen. Finally take a video of you peeling your start screen away and we will compile the videos and set it to music. Then world domination. 

Rules (for those who want to participate)

1. Wall paper **MUST** have your name on it. Now this can be your reddit name or your Psn name or both. 

2. Video must be at least 5 seconds long and no more than 10 seconds. 

3. No obscene stuff in the background. Please no nude girls/Nude men/nude you. 

4. Wall paper can have anything in it. I encourage you to make a really eye catching one. 

5. Be creative in how you peel the start screen. It doesn't have to be of your hand just peeling it away. Be creative. Anything goes. 

**Upload your video to a file sharing site and post link here or PM me for my email**

**DeadLine is March 20**

**r/Vita User RevolutionCBK has stepped up to be our main video editor my hat goes off to him**

This has dissapointed me because I would love to play on the Multiplayer Maps on the go with bots offline after I'm done with Single Player. If Guerrilla Games did this, the game's replayability would **increase drastically**. I'm also pretty sure many more people would buy this game if it did include this mode.

So this is what I want you guys to do, go to [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) and tweet this exact statement: "" Please include offline bots multiplayer into Killzone Mercenary. @killzone #offlinebotsMP #killzonemercenary ""

You guys can only acheive this, so please share this to people and many other gaming sites. If you any of you guys have a gaming site I would love if you posted this and shared it to more people!

I have asked Guerilla Games and the Killzone account so many times if there are going to be bots, and they never replied, so my guess would be no. So lets get bots for Killzone Mercenary! Onwards, to Victory!

I've always been a console player, but since getting this bad boy I've only powered up my Xbox to watch a couple movies. I keep getting sucked into the experiences I'm having with the Vita, and I know that over time the titles are only going to get more engrossing and more tightly developed.

I think this is one of the first games to take advantage of the systems capabilities. Graphics wise, may not be as good as the console, but then again you aren't playing this on a giant screen either. So in that case with a standard view distance you would not be able to tell the difference. Here is the real kicker about this console.....the ONLINE FUCKING ROCKS, i just clicked online vs mode, and within seconds i was connected to someone. BUt the amazingness does not end there, NO SIR, when i entered the game I heard a voice! Not a game character voice, but an actual human voice. The voice of the other person i was facing online. Boy was i surprised! That was awesome i had no clue that vita had online chat built in. We chatted and shit and I lost the match (bummer) but holy hell, this game and system pack serious pussy erupting power.

Welcome to the Unofficial ""Post your Indie Game Wishlist Here"" Thread!",TheConfusedDoorman,63,9,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1bvfzj/wish_to_get_a_indie_game_to_vita_welcome_to_the/,"As some of you have seen, Sony has been giving indie developers much love regarding getting their games to the Vita, and many developers have returned the affection, with games like [Stealth Bastard](http://www.stealthbastard.com/), [Terraria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraria), [Splunky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelunky), and even [Hotline Miami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Miami) all getting reVITAlized with a Vita release. This recent surge of great news has bled into our beloved subreddit, saturating the place with threads of ""Lets get (insert indie game here) to the Vita!"" I love the effort some redditors are showing, but as I read one redditor here say, This hodgepodge of requests and ""missions"" can make others lose interest, therefore making their efforts less efficient.

This is where this thread comes in, I say that if you want an indie game to the Vita, us redditors can show the developers how interested we'd be for a Vita release! The tactic has been helpful with games like *Two Brothers* and *Chasm* (Links to info of each game will be provided below). Want a game shown to the public of this subreddit? Think we'll help show the developer how awesome a Vita version of their game would be? Application to this list is **EASY!** Just add the name of the game you want to be given interest in a comment along with some info about it and I will look into it for you, providing ways to contact developers so it'll all be centered around one thread, making it easier to get your wish seen and easier for us redditors to show developers that we'd love to see their games on our precious handheld (The more Vita games, the better right?) 

Also, this thread is basically the first edition of something that can be updated MULTIPLE times, so if you have a suggestion to make this thread more accessible or just generally better, please share. Alright, let's get started! I provided a short starter list to get this thread kicked off on the right foot.

As my username implies, making long, boring lists (stealthily) is something only I could enjoy. I was beginning to worry about how much I was actually spending since I have a newborn but I was pleasantly surprised by how little I’ve spent for so much entertainment. Allow me to preface this by saying, like most late Vita adopters, the price was what initially kept me away, so I bought a 3DS instead around this time last year. After blowing through Ocarina of Time and Super Mario 3D Land, I found myself being less and less attached to my 3DS. The games were ok but Nintendo has always been kind of kiddy to me (aside from the 2 aforementioned titles). Finally, I sold my 3DS on Craigslist. The 3DS was a great system, it just wasn’t for me. I had pretty much given up on wanting a handheld until I heard amazon was going to have an amazing sale on the Vita for Black Friday. I convinced my wife to get me one for Christmas and it has been the best Christmas present I’ve ever received (aside from some NSFW stuff, but I better not get into that). Below is a breakdown of how much I’ve spent on the Vita and everything I’ve got for it thanks to all the sales Sony has been having lately:

•	Assassin’s Creed Vita Bundle - $180 (Black Friday deal)
          o	Assassin’s Creed; Liberation, 4GB memory card, Playstation Allstars Battle Royale, 3 free months of Playstation Plus

•	Sound Shapes - $7.50 (PS+ discount during a sale)

•	Escape Plan - $7.50 (PS+ discount during sale)

•	32GB memory card - $60 (Price match at Best Buy when Sony Store was selling it for that price)

•	Playstation + 1 year subscription - $50 (came with 3 free months so 15 months altogether)

•	Total = $305

What I got:

•	Playstation Vita – White

•	32 Gb memory card

•	4GB memory card

•	Assassin’s Creed; Liberation 

•	Playstation All Stars Battle Royale 

•	Gravity Rush

•	Uncharted; Golden Abyss

•	Tales from Space; Mutant Blobs Attack

•	Wipeout 2048

•	Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions

•	Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus

•	Retro City Rampage

•	Jetpack Joyride

•	Plants vs Zombies

•	Sound Shapes

•	Jet Set Radio

•	Chronovolt

•	Foosball 2012

•	Mega Man X Maverick Hunter

•	Escape Plan

•	Beats Slider

•	OMG Zombies

•	Beats Trellis

•	Aqua Kitty

•	Samurai Beatdown

•	Playstation Plus until June 25, 2014

I tried not to include stuff that would have been free but it is worth mentioning that Wake Up Club, Ecolibrium, Frobisher Says, Fireworks, Table Soccer and Treasures of Montezuma Blitz are also included. This also doesn’t include the 4 free games Sony is giving away today since I just read about this as I was making the list (I also plan on buying dokuro since it’s on sale):

•	Wild Arms (PS one Classic)

•	Patapon (PSP)

•	Piyotama (PSP)

•	Patchwork Heroes (PSP)

If you haven't already seen me around answering questions, I am one of the developers at Queasy who worked on Sound Shapes.  Just wanted to let you know the status of the network issues (not cloud sync but the general inability to get online).

Basically... too much awesome.  I don't think we were prepared for the sudden burst of community involvement!  We're going to increase our capacity for awesome ASAP.

Just to throw some numbers your way, we've averaging about 1000 new levels a day!  Some levels are well on their way to 10,000 plays!

If anything else comes up, I'll update the OP.  Sorry for all these networking issues, we are working as hard as possible to fix everything so you guys can get back to creating and sharing levels!  We love what we've played so far!

Update 1 (Saturday Aug 11, 4:10pm EST):
So we're making progress but it's slower than we'd like.  Good news is that the issue isn't effecting everyone (it's actually a smallish percentage, but the fact it's effecting anyone makes everyone at queasy upset); It's worth it to keep trying.

If you ARE having the issue I know how you feel (literally, I'm locked out to!) and it sucks.  The best consolation I can give is that as soon as you get back online, you'll have a ton of new levels to try!

Update 2 (Saturday Aug 11, 8:41pm EST):
Not much else to say.  Apparently by our rough numbers, 12% of people are being effected by the sign in issue.  This afternoon we were still getting over 600 successful logins per hour, so I guess it's good SOME people are getting in.

As far as a solution, I am literally now sitting at my desk coordinating with 3 different studio locations, in 3 different time zones.  We're trying to go as quickly as we can and I promise you when we know what the issue is and when the fix will be available, I will let you know!

Update 3 (Sunday Aug 12, 10:41am EST):
Okay, I was in our office until quarter past midnight last night, mostly spent on the phone with Santa Monica trying to coordinate things.  I'm at it again today with Jon Mak, waiting for a conference call between all the studios to get more people helping with solving the issue at once.  Yay coordination!  

I know it's not really real movement but thought I should keep you guys informed that everyone involved is definitely still working to solve the issue!

Update 4 (Sunday Aug 12, 1:57am EST):
So we are MUCH closer than ever before to figure out the issue!  Yay!  I still can't give an exact ETA because the issue doesn't lie in Queasy's jurisdiction (Sony handles the servers) but what I said before about the amount of awesome being too high seems to be the case.

We are looking at beefing up the servers but we need to know what part of the server process is the bottleneck first to make sure we're beefing up the right thing.  We're leaving that in a few very capable peoples hands... Jon and I have given them as much information as we could and haven't eaten yet today so we are headed out.  I'll let you guys know anything I can when I hear back from the great people we have working on the issue.

**tl;dr** The issue is HOPEFULLY going to be fixed soon!

Please help by sharing anything you notice.  (note: specific PS One games aren't related to the update itself, so keep that to the PS One list thread).

[Official YouTube Trailer for 1.80](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPJyUta3RRA)

* **PS One Classics Support:** PS One games are playable on the Vita but, sadly, not the entire library from the start.  The actual implantation is quite nice and feature rich.  The only downside of the controls is that d-pad only games cannot be controlled with the analog stick.  [See it in action.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJKrTQfrNcw&amp;feature=g-all-u) A list of officially supported games can be found [here.](http://redd.it/yz74q)  A list of unofficially supported games (from PS3 transfering) can be found [here.](http://redd.it/yxtt6)  A video how to transfer a PS One game from the PS3 to the Vita can be found [here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YUhf_4P7vU&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=17s)

* **Cross Controller:** The new Cross-Controller feature will allow you to use PS Vita as a controller to play compatible games on PS3, such as LittleBigPlanet 2.  (Note: The games must be specially patch to work with this feature.)  It lets you take advantage of PS Vita’s rich features including the touch screen, rear touch pad, six-axis motion sensing system, and cameras. To access the cross controller feature you need to launch the Remote Play application and then click on the Cross-Controller icon.

* **Home/Save Screen Button Control:**  As many of you have requested, you will now have the option to control the home screen and some features of applications such as Videos and Music with the buttons on the PS Vita system.  Button controls have also been added to the ""Save"" API, meaning that any Vita/PSP game that uses the system's built in save utility for saving can now be controlled by buttons.

* **Playlist and iTunes Support:** Playlists will be supported in Music. You will be able to transfer iTunes (10.6.3 or later), M3U, and M3U8 playlists from a PS3 or a PC using Content Manager.
Web Browser

* **Browser Scrolling:** Rear-touch pad operation will be supported by the browser, allowing you to scroll through and zoom out of pages without obscuring the screen.  Additionally, a quick scroll to the top button has been added in the upper-left hand corner.

* **Brower Performance Enhancement:** Checkerboarding still exists but occurs less frequently, and everything is faster.  ([thread](http://redd.it/yxw3u))

* **Video Control Tweaks:** Playback speed control and repeat play have been added to Videos.

* **MPO Photo Format Support:** Viewing photos in MPO format will now be supported, with the ability to transfer MPO files from PS3™ and PC using Content Manager.  (3D and multi-angle viewing are still NOT supported.)

* **Group Messaging Changes:** Along with some new layout enhancements, you will be able to take photos to add as attachments when writing Group Messages.

* **Maps App Improvements:** The Maps feature has been improved by adding a button on the top screen to switch between “Search for Location” and “Search for Directions.” You can also touch and hold a location on the map and place a user flag.

* **NEAR Enhancements:** NEAR will be able to gather the information of surrounding Wi-Fi access points without internet connection and update the location data based on it later. You can get location data within the area covered by Wi-Fi location services. Additionally, the option to [automatically download game goods](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/yyf7d/automatically_download_game_goods_in_near/) has been added and can be set for each individual game.

* **PSP Emulation Improvements:** New layouts have been added for the right stick as well as the ability to assign face buttons to the corners of the touch screen. ([thread](http://redd.it/yy7p0))

* **Notification Center Revamped:** The Notification Center is also no longer a separate app and you can delete notes from the popup itself.  Additionally, the pop-ups are smaller and you have the option to turn them off entirely from the Settings app.

* **Memory cards are now locked to a single PSN account:** Once you update to 1.80, you can no longer change the PSN account on that card without formatting. ([thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/yzoy6/new_ps_vita_firmware_locks_memory_cards_to_single))

* **New Background Colors?!** [Can it bet true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/yz48q/180_details_thread/c60seqz)

Was really looking forward to it, because I genuinly like Amanita and their games.

So I started it up and, oh boy, you move the cursor with the left stick, alright, the front touchpad, okay, no problem. AND the rear touchpad. That really bums me out. Is it just me? I can't hold the Vita properly or in a comfortable way without touching the rear touchpad accidently.

There is ofcourse an upside to using the rear touchpad. Many games, like Uncharted, use it and use it well. But some get it all wrong. Like Knytt Underground. Using the rear touchpad to cling to the robots in ball form was a real pain. And Machinarium, troublesome already. Why do developer keep using the rear touchpad without thinking it all the way through?

Aside from having a similar graphical style, ""Kung Fu FIGHT!"" is different from ""Quiet, Please!"" in pretty much every way. Instead of a relaxing adventure, it is an unforgivingly difficult, frenetically fast-paced romp.

I'm in my 40's with reflexes to match, and I can pretty much breeze through the game in Brutal mode.

I love how their is just so much to do, with all the characters you can play as, jobs to do, and minigames available. I saw that IGN gave Sly a 8/10, which is commendable, but I feel like the game just really deserves your attention. I never thought that I would be playing a Playstation 2.5 level game on a mobile console, but seeing is believing. IGN also said that the game ""Felt better"" on the PS3, and while the graphics are marginally sharper, I feel right at home on the vita. Plus its only 40 dollars, I couldn't be happier. If I continue on his trend the game is looking to take 50+ hours to 100%, with a 30 hour main story, thats a great bench mark alone, and I hope it sets the standard going forward. Sly 4 made me fall in love with the Vita all over again. Sorry about all the gushing, I just felt like I had to tell someone.

The Playstation Vita supports the PNG file format, it also allows you to set those PNG as backgrounds, which means you can use the animated vita backgrounds and still apply this over it, however if you change the vita animation color you'll have to set the wallpaper again.

*Edit 1*: (not sure what happend to this one). I got to try Dragons Crown and Spelunky and yes, we should be excited for both. I'll go back later for Tearaway and Killzone Mercenary. I'll give full impressions later.
 
*Edit 2*: I'll be giving full impressions later tonight. I am going to some panels right now. Post of you'd like a Chance to win PS plus 30 day codes.

*Edit 3*: I have got 3 more codes to give away! I got to play Arkham Blackgate, Killzone Merc., Spelunky, and Dragon's Crown (I also got to play Beyond Two Souls which someone requested). I'll write down my full impressions tonight when I'm in front of the computer.

*Edit 4*: Alright time to respond to some of your questions . Here is what I got to play or see. First I played Spelunky, Dragon's Crown, Killzone Mercenary, Beyond Two Souls (PS3 exclusive), Killzone Mercenary, and exclusive gameplay footage of Watch Dogs (PS3, 4, 360, and XboxOne). Tearaway and The Walking Dead were also playable but I didn't have enough time. Also, NO STORY SPOILERS!

**Spelunky**: I have yet to play any other version of this. What I played was a pretty short level where I had the option of several characters to start with. there was a girl in a dress, an older guy, and whom I assume is Spelunky. I played as the later. As Spelunky I had a short whip attack and 3 bombs and 3 grappling ropes which allowed me to move vertically when there weren't latters. There is already plenty of information on the game itself so I""ll just say the game ran smoothly. I did not notice any slowdown's or odd effects of any sort. It seems like the perfect pick up and play game similar to Hotline Miami in that, you can restart a level immediately and you die often. Escaping the ghost is freaking terrifying if you've collected a lot of gold.


**Dragon's Crown**: Damn, I am excited for this game. What was on display was single player only. Dwarf, Knight, Amazon, Wizard, Archer, and Sorceress were all available to play. I chose the Wizard. The art was gorgeous and the voice acting appropriate for the theme. You start out in a tavern all hanging out together. This acts as the character select screen. After choosing a class you are prompted to customize your character's color and name. There are several different save slots to have multiple play-throughs going at once with different characters. 

Shortly, you are introduced to a rogue (the hunch backed looking fellow carrying that nice big ol' Santa bag). He seems to accompany you for the first part of your journey acting as the touch screen functionality. Where you touch he will go, usually to unlock a chest or a door. You can also touch enemies to see health, names, and possibly stats. As the wizard I had two different main attacks. One attack was fire based and would do varying actions depending on the inputs. You could cast a wall of fire that was short in range and would jut up directly in front of you. You could also leap into the air casting 3 deadly fireballs horizontally or blast a trail of fire out in front of the wizard for any enemy standing in its path to get burned. The other attack boasted similar variance and was also animated beautifully. 

In addition to two attacks there were also weapons that you could pick up during battle. The item I was privy to was the crossbow. It had one attack, which was to shoot bolts directly out in front. This seems like it could be a life-saver for the time when you run out of mana and don't have adequate room to charge it. There also seems to be a robust item system which can be quickly accessed in a menu with the D-pad. Left and right scroll and down uses the item. 

What caught my attention most was not all that is described above, but the pace of the character. The wizard felt agile. He could jump, strafe, and teleport with ease. So often 2D beat-em up games fall victim to slow moving characters and getting around the world is a chore solved by jumping and divekicking. Which is something that I personally cannot stand. Gameplay was smooth with no frame rate drops. My only concern is aiming attacks along the X-axis (horizontal). There were times I thought I was lined up only to miss.

The world seems big and immersive with plenty of variance in characters and enemy types. However, I only got a small taste of exploring (just the intro. level and the hub town). This game seems to live up to the hype and it is great the vita version seems to be just as good as the PS3.

Wow, That was longer than expected. I am going to have to write my other impressions tomorrow. It is late here :/

**Edit 5**: All the PS Plus trail codes have been given out. Sorry I couldn't get enough for everyone, but I gave them out at random. Also, I'll be writing up my impressions in a separate thread since I am sure this one will eventually get buried, so no one will see it if they are interested.

1358060500.0,49,self.vita,16hd04,I've spent hours playing the SOUL SACRIFICE demo. Here's my review of it.,JalenTheEpic,59,10,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/16hd04/ive_spent_hours_playing_the_soul_sacrifice_demo/,"I got my extra memory card, and went into the Japanese store to get the soul sacrifice demo. I was really excited.

Despite my excitement I still thought it would be a bad Phantsy Star, or Monster hunter rip-off... I was so wrong.

This game is one of the greatest games I have played.
It's fun its addicting, and replayable.

**Good points**

* **Story:** Soul sacrifice has a nice story(I can't read japanese but I've seen videos explaining it)
* **High Replayability:** I've put more hours into the demo than I have lots of other games. It is very fun to replay the same levels with different goals or spells to change it up a bit. The boss fights are really fun and replayable(like on monster hunter, although the game plays differently)
* **Spells/abilities:**The spell creation/combination system is great. I love how I'm able to create new spells my mixing others, or power them up by mixing them together. You can also set augments on your arm to give different bonuses. You can use the environment to gain temporary spells during battle, this is very useful when you're running out of spell uses.
* **Gameplay:**The game itself is loads of fun. It's really fun to battle and try to obtain new spells. I can't really think of another game this feels like. 
* **The level system:** The level system is based off of the amount of saves or sacrifices you do. More sacrifices= more attack
more saves = more defense
* **Multiplayer**:The multiplayer is nearly flawless. I live in the midwest in america, with an okay connection. But I was playing with people in japan. Despite this it was one of the best, most wonderful experiences I've had. People were able to join my matches quickly, and once in the match things were very VERY smooth. There was zero to no lag. 

* **Touch controls:** Touch control is mostly optional, but very functional. It complements the gameplay. You can control menus, and help people while sacrificed.

* **Great partner system:** You can get partners that you are able to level up and customize. If you sacrifice them they're gone until you bring them back. You can choose partners that suit the mission with their unique skills and spells.

* **Graphics:** This game looks amazing on the vita. It's within the best looking vita games out there. Simply amazing
 
* **Music:** The music is great. You can tell how much effort was put into the making of this game. The soundtrack is no exception to that.



**Bad points**

* Maps are just small sized arenas with not too much to explore
* Grinding can get annoying
* No reason not to get sacrificed because it gives you a huge bonus.
* Clothing options are really limited, I'm hoping there's a lot more in the full game

Even though this game is just a demo, I would have happily payed the 
$40 for just this. It's amazing, and I've had more fun with this demo than many other handheld action rpg games. 

If the demo is this amazingly good, then I'm sure the full release will be even better. I can't wait.

**TL;DR-** If you like action RPGs this game is for you. Even the demo of this game is worth $40. This will be a day one buy for me

Instead, I was so pleasantly surprised with the game that I decided to write this short review.",hCORE22,61,13,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/v15ot/hi_guys_i_picked_up_gravity_rush_expecting_to_be/,"If you've played the demo, try to forget you ever did. 

The demo does this game ABSOLUTELY no justice.

Between the IGN review and the game's demo I expected a short, simple and easy action game with interesting movement methods, generally good art direction and lackluster action...

Boy, was I wrong...

The game's action is PHENOMENAL. I'm the type of guy that finishes Ninja Gaiden II on mentor difficulty (and enjoys every second of it) and I tend to shun games like assassin's creed because of the simple combat and easy difficulty. I was not expecting this game to have the solid and rewarding combat that it does!! 

Despite IGN's review making the game look like a float-kick-repeat affair, the game actually gives you a very wide margin to fight and move however you want ([even if that means playing like Greg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52D2xehUOsA&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=134s)). I end up flipping around after gravity sliding, strafing side to side in mid-air and bouncing off of walls when I fight bosses and it's not just for show, the bosses are varied (and difficult) enough to warrant trying out crazy strategies. When you get a grip of the combat (unlike Greg ""hide-and-recharge-special-powers"" Miller) it will look like a mexican wrestler had a baby with sailor moon but feel COMPLETELY NATURAL. There is even a gravity power you get from the start which is seldom shown-off on the reviews; it allows you to pick up and hurl debris at enemies adding an option for long-range combat to the game. I haven't been so excited about kicking a huge monster's ass since Shadow of the Colossus. The bosses are fun, very varied and fit in well with the story. For the sake of not spoiling anything, you will have to trust me in that they are NOT just differently shaped blobs and endless similar mobs. This brings me to my next point...

Everything regarding presentation is A+ material!! The comicbook cut-scenes were EVEN BETTER than reviewers made them out to be. They're very dynamic and let the developers do crazy things with the different planes to maintain the pace of the story. The video cut-scenes are also above average and would fit in perfectly in any modern anime. The story is expertly tied together; It manages to be deep while maintaining its cohesion and the character design is phenomenal and unique. The heroes, villains and monsters are all interesting and would fit in perfectly in an indie, breakthrough comic. To be honest, the game design feels tailored to comic book and mahou shoujo fans (and if you classify in either camp, you're probably already playing the game).


The music is also fantastic. Few are the games which have [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCMTNx-OWI&amp;feature=relmfu) level of sound production. The soundtrack is varied but nothing feels even slightly out of place. I'd compare it to Cowboy Bebop's soundworks with absolutely no qualms (not an easy thing to do).


The challenges are actually... CHALLENGING! I'm talking about ""forget-about-ever-getting-gold"" challenging. If you're like me, that's a good thing and along with the relaxed nature of the game's exploration mechanics, the tittle manages to have excellent pick-up and play elements despite being very story-heavy.

I would honestly place this game along with Portal and Shadow of the Colossus in terms of novel gameplay and story. It's THAT good.

After a few hours of playing I can say that it was a waste of brain power, this game is down right awesome!

-Forgiving to new players, simple to get into

-As complicated as you want it to be, there are tons of strategic things you can do to deepen the experience

-Voice acting. A great addition to any game, but this is really good. They use a lot of famous voice actors. If you are a fan of video-games and/or anime and cartoons then you will hear a lot of familiar voices.

-So much value for your money. Main story 20+ hours long, New Game+, and I must say 10 MILLION HOURS DOOD of endgame playing.

-Unique. God, this game reeks of uniqueness. When your smacking people with a tower of 8 teammates you know your in for a treat. Monsters can be joined with humans(demons?) to form unique combinations. 

-Unlike Final Fantasy Tactics, the game has a much faster pace. If well planned out a battle can be over in less then two minutes. You pick your whole teams actions before switching sides. It's much less slow-paced.


I don't know what else I can say. I am only a few hours in, but this game is just sweet. I regret not looking into the series earlier. I can safely say I will day-1 any future game on the Vita in this series.

WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. - March 28, 2013 - 505 Games, a global publisher of video games, today announced that the block-building smash hit Terraria is headed to the PlayStation®Vita system (PS Vita). In development by Engine Software, Terraria for PS Vita will be available in summer 2013.  
   
Originally released in 2011 for the PC by creator/developer Andrew Spinks' Re-logic studio, Terraria has received universal, critical acclaim and over 2 million ""Terrarians"" have struck out on their own adventures and fallen for it's mix of side-scrolling, action-adventure gaming and emphasis on crafting and exploration.  
   
Tim Woodley, Head of Global Brand at 505 Games said, ""We're all huge fans of Terraria and have been overwhelmed by the support we've received from the existing community since we began working with the property. And it's been amazing to see how many of those fans have been asking for a portable version of Terraria so they can take their adventures with them on the go. The biggest challenge for us is how to give players the control they need to fully enjoy the experience and we're really excited to explore the potential of the multiple input options that the PlayStation Vita affords us.""  
   
Commenting on the announcement, SCEE's Senior Business Development Manager Shahid Ahmad said, ""We are tremendously excited about bringing Terraria to PS Vita. It's fantastic news for fans who have been begging for the game to be available on PS Vita and it's fantastic news for us too, we are delighted about the addition to the platform. For us this is a real coup, the opportunity to bring such a loved game to one of our platforms is really exciting. We are also really confident about how much fans are going to love the PS Vita version; the touch screen will ensure a totally unique experience.""

With that being said, there are some great free themes out there. One of which is this pack of Persona 4 themes I found. 

The pack has one theme for every member of the investigation team, as well as a theme that cycles though all of them (that's why one of them is significantly larger than the rest).

I found the themes in [this giantbomb thread](http://www.giantbomb.com/persona-4-golden/3030-36273/forums/persona-4-golden-dynamic-theme-for-ps3-568264/), and [I reuploaded them to MEGA](https://mega.co.nz/#!0EEHSSKS!DXCA1y-2RSXdsHeLJGNqTknV4ncMqps7iIn89GGzp1c) (because the hosting site they use has awful bandwidth. Enjoy! 
______

**EDIT: Here's how to install the themes on your PS3**

Make a folder called ""PS3"" and put it on a thumbdrive. Then put a folder named ""THEME"" inside the PS3 folder, and drag all the themes into there.
Go to theme settings, select ""install"" and choose the themes from the thumbdrive. Installation takes about 10 seconds per theme, except for the last one, which should take about a minute (because it's huge).

1368194254.0,50,self.vita,1e2h1t,SEGA has 5 Vita titles coming for the next financial year?,gene_parmesan258,57,7,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1e2h1t/sega_has_5_vita_titles_coming_for_the_next/,"In the second table in this source:

http://www.abload.de/img/capture2nrp2i.png

Under ""FY Ending March 2014"" -&gt; ""full year forecasts"" -&gt; then under the ""SKU"" column, it lists 5 Vita titles coming and a prediction of 650k sales for them combined.

Also consider that their plans for the first two quarters of this FY (up to September 2013 I believe), they plan to release 1 game with 40,000 predicted sales (shown in the ""Forecasts through 2Q column).

So they have 4 Vita titles coming from September 2013 -&gt; March 2014 and predicted sales of 610k for them combined.  

I'm guessing the 40k title releasing in the next 2 quarters will be Japan-only, something small.  But let the speculation commence on what the rest of the games will be!

I reckon there's a high chance of the next Sonic game coming to Vita.  Perhaps Football Manager will migrate from PSP to Vita as well.  I also suspect there's a high chance of some niche Japanese stuff coming like a new Shining game or (perhaps) a Valkyria Chronicles.

The optimist in me wants it to be Yakuza.

Thoughts?

Right now they're only planning to support PC, Linux, Macintosh, Android, iOS, and the Xbox 360. They recently opened up their minds to supporting the PlayStation platforms we know and love today, so if you're interested, let them know!  

I realize r/Vita is not my personal army, but this is shaping up to become a beautiful game, and it would be a shame to see it not come to our wonderful handheld and/or the PS3/PS4.  

**About the Game:**  
Two Brothers is an Indie game being actively developed by AckkStudios (with the Unity 3D engine). With classic Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy-inspired gameplay, you can expect this game to look a lot like RPGs from the 1980-90's. It features cameos and references to older games and some Internet pop culture. To understand the full experience that is ""Two Brothers"", please watch one or two of the movies below.

Nintendo just released a major system seller slated for an October 2013 release. 

Realistically, how do you think Sony is going to react? We know they are having a press conference in late February where there is speculation for them to make some major announcements. The lack of Monster Hunter is frightening. Another system seller I can think of would be Kingdom Hearts, but again, Nintendo snagged that. I'm not really sure how Sony reacts from a software side of things. 

From a hardware perspective, I predict that Sony will announce a price drop soon for both the Vita and memory cards and maybe introduce another tier (64 or 128).
