Hulu is a bit more tough, you need to go to http://www.stealthy.co/ and install the addon for firefox or chrome, if you use internet explorer you fail...

Once you have the little stealth bomber icon click configure then check the third box ""Enter the country from where......."" and type in the letters ""US""

You are set, go enjoy Hulu.com, if it loads too slow just click the stealthy icon on and off again to find a new proxy.

This was designed to allow people in the arab world to easily bypass their government's firewalls so they made it user friendly

Ohh one more thing, when you are not watching tv, make sure you turn stealthy off, it will slow down your internet a little and it is an unnecessary strain on the proxy servers the addon uses.

Well, everything went great. 


The meeting of the Father was almost like a job interview (which was expected), I did well and he was pleased with me. His only requests were that I love his daughter, treat his wife like a second mother and that I drink beer with him and occasionally play golf at his club. 

Later that night I found a local but romantic spot to propose to my girlfriend and with delight, she said yes :) 

Here's a picture of the two of us at her cousin's wedding. It was a great ceremony and we even got to take part in the pebaek. Which was fun.

Apparently my parents will be taking part in our pebaek and last week we even went out to choose our hanbok. 

We'll be having two wedding's, England and Korea...next year though, which gives us plenty of time to plan things. 


Anyway, been here just over a week now and am having a great time. We leave on Saturday, so still have plenty of plans.

Hello,

I am a 29 year old Korean guy who will be returning to Seoul around the 26th of September. This is me: http://imgur.com/a/0PF5y#0

I am gay, and I've been disowned by my family... this won't be some triumphant return for me. I'm trying to re-build my shaken confidence and start my life from scratch; meaning I'm not looking for sex or to jump into a relationship necessarily. I just want to meet good, fun people to go hiking, kayaking, out to bars, concerts, museums, play board games with, watch movies, have conversations with, etc.

I speak fluent Korean so if you're an expat (""외국인"") who needs someone to practice Korean with, I can help you with that. :)

Cheers.

EDIT: Your gender doesn't matter to me. I'm honestly just looking for friends.

Come join us &amp; discuss all things reddit!",Taurius,96,11,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/wp5oh/hey_rkorea_im_the_day_manager_for_a_cafebar_in/,"The cafe/bar is called, ""Dar ;)""  Moon Cafe in English

We're a quiet and relaxing cafe during the day (you still can order alcohol) and a packed bar at night. We're located in the famous cafe district in Hongdae. The area is quiet compared to the club areas, so you wouldn't feel overwhelmed with so many people around. We also have free WiFi!

We're having a special opening event this coming Sunday starting at 5pm. BBQ! I'll be grilling up some sample steaks this Wed the 18th. So come on by Wed and buy a drink and I'll grill up a steak with your beverage.

And yes, I'll say ""midnight"" :P

Location. 5 minute walk from Hapjeong Station (Line6 or Line2), Exit #5. Hours: 11am-8pm Wed-Sat, 1pm-closing? Sun.

Dress Code: Clubs in Korea are not as strict compared to the super clubs of the US. Key rules: No sandals or open-toed shoes. No shorts. The dress code is more strict south of the river. It's pretty non-existent at many Hongdae clubs.

Tips: Always check for the sites for events. Information for a free entry before midnight will usually be available. Every weekend multiple clubs have events so don't waste your money on cover fees! Also, download 'Club Mix' on your smartphone. Under the 'Party' tab, each date will have a list of clubs. You can show the app at the front desk at any of the clubs listed for that date and gain free entry. Check the info for the club first: '혜택' will display the time you can use the app (이전 - before, 까지 - until) and also how many people you can bring with the app (본인 - self, 동반#인 - with # people). Usually you can gain free entry with the app before midnight along with 2 friends.

The posts are vague - some are too serious, some are funny, some related to politics, and some are requests for translations. There aren't much comments either. I think this needs to change - this subreddit is a great place for korea related redditors to get to know each other, to help each other, to meet each other. There can be a lot more posts with a lot of comments in it. To turn this subreddit around, I think the subreddit needs a new design. I'm not sure about others but I think that flag is old and ugly. There needs to be drawn flairs that represent dokdo, seoul, kimchi, whatever, to spice things up. Next, we need more decent posts. Instead of linking the sites, people need to post their stories on why they came to korea or how they became a redditor in korea. There can also be lots of questions on what dukbokki place is the best in seoul, busan, whatever. I would also like to see discussions on /r/korea, ranging from mcdonalds vs lotteria to nk vs sk. So basically, more text posts and less link posts. I'm not sure if this is even gonna be read by most people, but if you did, feel free to comment on your suggestions on improving this subreddit. Thank you.

So if one subscriber sees another post and the poster is from the same town as a certain viewer, it could be much easier to get a quicker and faster connection... I know that barely made sense, but I hope you understood what I just said.

**Edit** Instead of choosing specific flairs, people should have the liberty to write in their own flairs. So for example a flair would be ""Seoul-Apgujeong"" or wherever. The reason why it isn't ""Pick a certain town"" is because some people may not feel comfortable disclosing specific information about themselves. Also, redditors that browse /r/Korea also live in different countries, whether it be because their teaching contracts ended or they're just interested in the Korean culture and news.

(rant),CoreaComplaint,90,36,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/190hof/why_are_koreans_so_spatially_inconsiderate_rant/,"I just made a public outburst and feel bad about it yet I think that in reflection, it was somewhat warranted.

I'm a foreigner whose been living/teaching in Korea for five years. I've lived in Seoul, Suwon, Anyang, and Ansan (now living in Itaewon). I've had this complaint about Koreans in Korea for quite sometime but every time I tell someone about it, people either don't know what I'm talking about or in the case of my Korean wife, make excuse after excuse for it (usually: ""Korea is a small country with a large population so that's why it's like that). 

Anyway, people always block the freaking escalators. I know that the law says that people should stand on both sides, however the law says the exact same thing in Japan and when I was in Tokyo for a few weeks the other month, I never saw people block both sides of the escalator in a crowded place. Sometimes adjumma in Korea will block both sides despite the large thumping noise people make announcing that they're walking and want to go through--then they always refuse to move, so in my case, I just take to walking over them which has got me called a ""gesekki"" and other unpleasant things. For a 빨리 빨리 culture people sure don't like to exert themselves unless they have to.

Subway cars and elevator doors are the same. Koreans never wait for passengers to unload before loading themselves. My outburst today was caused by this happening to me twice in a row. I was carrying a heavy bag at Seoul station (airport line) so I took an elevator to the platform and when the doors open at the bottom, twenty people squeezed in front of me boxing me in denying me the ability to get out of the fucking elevator. I had to wait to go up six floors again, then down six floors again (missing two trains) where I had to violently shove my way out. I lost my temper an hour later when the same thing happened on a bus (I missed my stop because people shoved in before I could get out) so I said ""JESUS FUCKING CHRIST"" when I finally departed. 

Kids and old people are the worst too. Kids will block entire sidewalks/convenience store entrances/hallways/everywhere and won't move or even feel acknowledge it unless you shove them and even then, they'll just carry on talking to their friends. All you need is two old ladies to block the exit to a bus, a train, or pretty much anything. Adjosshi seem to enjoy bumping into each other. It's not limited to physicality too... there is no volume control either. I was in one of those coffee shops that is for studying (there are signs telling everyone to be quiet and you can borrow books there) when an adjumma strolled in and talked on her phone at a deafing volume for hours (annoyingly--calling her kid's hagwon and complaining that their kids weren't getting enough homework and all that bullshit). 

Don't even get me started on driving. I rode a motorcycle here for three years and stopped because it was causing me so much stress. It got especially bad when I moved to Seoul and had to deal with so much retardedness on the road so I sold my bike. Just the other week I saw an adjumma swerve across five lanes of traffic on the 한남대교 bridge so she could make the exit ramp. She didn't signal or anything so it was no surprise when I heard a loud *clap* and turned around (I was in a taxi) to see her car stuck halfway into a minivan. 

I'm really annoyed about this. People always blame the population density or Confucianism but I think that's total bullshit. Koreans are such nice people and I do love living here so don't get the wrong idea, I'm not trying to start a fight or anything. I just really don't understand why it is the way it is. As I said, I can go to Japan, into the most dense areas in Tokyo or Osaka and rarely experience this and when it does happen, people always apologize which allows me to let it go and not carry it around as baggage. Here people never apologize or even seem to care. 

So I'm asking, why? WHY?!!?

I recently started to notice a depressing lack of voting on /r/korea, on both posts and comments.  [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/12sgmm/i_want_to_know_the_people_of_this_subreddit/) inspired me to post a request to the community to use those up- and down-vote buttons more!  This is a pretty 'tame' post with no real controversy, deep insights, or trolls (well, almost), but I felt that a lot of people took the time to respond to the OP and most of the comments were sitting at only 1 or 2 points.  Personally, I believe they deserve more not just for the karma but as an expression that the comments have been read and appreciated.

And it's not just that particular post.  Currently the top post on /r/korea has 21 points and the top comment on that post has 6.  With over 5,000 readers, these numbers should be higher.  The whole point of voting is to allow the quality posts and comments to rise to the top.  More importantly, though, is the fact that we're a small sub-reddit; let's show some support!",,False,self,t5_2qiog,False,,Seoul,True,t3_12tzlp,http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/12tzlp/hey_rkorea_use_those_up_and_downvote_buttons/,

I'm just recommending a rock-solid little application I discovered.

http://www.spotflux.com/

For various reasons, the Korean government bans some websites (mostly porn). On occasion I have come across a legit site that I wanted to look at but was banned too (I don't know why). And, of course, Korea bans any pro-North Korean sites including the official NK govt websites.

So, I had been researching ways to circumvent the government censorship filter. Spotflux does the trick. It's easy to use and is available for windows, mac and on mobile devices. It's a very, very simple product.

Ostensibly, spotflux is a personal security tool to protect your computer (by compressing and encrypting your traffic). This is perfectly legal since it helps stop unwanted cookies, viruses and malicious scripts. It also anonymises your location (again protecting you from cookies, location tracking and such).

The upshot is that it easily walks around internet filters. Using this I've been able to access North Korean websites, all popular porn site ... for, um, testing purposes ;) ... and have yet to find a site that doesn't work.

So, no affiliation from me, just a heads up and a recommendation for a good piece of software.

A good friend of mine has recently been promoted to the manager for a small dive bar in Sinchon. The bar has been a part of Sinchon music culture for the last 20 years. I've been DJing here on and off for a few hours a week for the last 8 months or so and its been one of the coolest places I've had the pleasure of experiencing here - it caters to interesting crowds, supports indie/underground music scenes, and has escaped the top-40-fication that I've seen in lots of other small niche bars around Korea.

The last few months, however, have not been so great and my buddy is trying to get the bar back into the swing of things. This is where I'm hoping to get some help from you guys.

We've done lots of cultural events in the past, including hosting monthly Hip-Hop nights with live performers, a weekly show for local rock/indie groups, trivia nights, party nights, etc. but we are always looking for more stuff. We are looking for collaborators who have ideas and the motivation to bring people together, share culture, share music, share food, or whatever else you can think of. We're equipped with a sound system, mics, and your basic instruments.

I really don't want to see my favorite bar turn into another top 40 playing cliche. Really hope to hear from some of the creative minds housed here on Reddit. Below is the facebook page, and if you're interested in possibly doing something, reply or send a PM and we can talk via email.

[Here's the facebook for the bar!](https://www.facebook.com/nori.namjas?fref=ts)

One night when drunk I stole a chair from a Lotteria because I was drunk and stupid. Eventually it came back to me, I met with the police, the Lotteria manager, agreed to pay any fines, returned the chair. Everything seemed to be going fine until I was told recently that the police were not allowing the Lotteria manager to settle this out of the legal system. According to the police, due to recent foreigner crimes, they want to treat this as a serious criminal matter.

Now, before it was pushed up to a more serious police matter, I had deferred any legal counsel offered by the police. I'm in the process of re-establishing that now, but I was wondering if anyone here had any sort of constructive advice they could offer. I'm very much in the dark here, and at the risk of inviting a whole spectrum of answers, I'm curious as to the maximum legal penalty here. Deportation is what I've got as a worst case scenario in my head right now, but could this potentially be any worse?

1345899950.0,38,self.korea,ysypq,Here's all the proof you need that Mannam Volunteer Association is the same thing as Shinchonji Church of Jesus,fostergregd,50,12,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/ysypq/heres_all_the_proof_you_need_that_mannam/,"There was a [recent submission here about the Mannam Volunteer Association](http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/yk3gz/whats_up_with_this_mannam_volunteer_association/) that's always recruiting foreigners.

The Mannam group is currently preparing for their ""World Peace Festival in Seoul"" on September 16.  [Here's the invitation on Koreabridge](http://koreabridge.net/event/mannam-world-peace-festival-seoul-september-2012).

In the comments of that Koreabridge post, someone posted [a very different press release about the same event](http://www.alisolagunanews.com/community/2012/08/21/event-will-involve-its-150).  EDIT: **12 hours later, this link is already down.**  [Here's the text of what was there](http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/ysypq/heres_all_the_proof_you_need_that_mannam/c5ykm2q).

The Mannam invitation doesn't mention anything about a Church, or the Bible, or anything religious at all.  It is presented as a secular event to promote the cause of World Peace.  

The other invitation (to the same event!) says the following:

&gt;A highlight of the Olympiad Heaven’s Culture events will feature a spectacular 100,000-member card performance that will stretch across the stadium seats, painting a story of God’s 6,000 years of work.

&gt;The Shinchonji National Olympiad will showcase the purpose and will of God in the New Testament—to create God’s kingdom, the 12 Tribes.

&gt;The glory of God’s fulfillment, never before seen will shine at the Shinchonji National Olympiad.

Here's a Youtube video of the [2008 Shinchonji Olympiad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMujBYY_qVo).  It is seriously creepy.

Shinchonji (""New Heaven and Earth"") Church was founded by Lee Man-Hee.  Lee Man-Hee is also [the Honorary Chairman of Mannam](http://mannam.org/en/content.php?p=about/greet).

I can draw no other conclusion than this:  **the Mannam Volunteer Association is a front group for the Shinchonji Church.  They use Mannam to attract foreigners to their events.  They are dishonest in doing so**, because they tell foreigners that Mannam is a secular organization simply working ""for world peace"".

EDIT: [This blog](http://www.shinchonji.org/wp/) is apparently run by the church.  I'll just post a few quotes here.

&gt;Currently, the pastor of Shinchonji Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony is creating God’s kingdom of heaven here on earth just as he saw it in heaven.  

&gt;Just as Jacob physically gave birth to twelve sons in the past and created the twelve tribes of Israel (Gn 49), he became the New Spiritual Israel, created the twelve tribes, and is bearing twelve crops of fruit every month.  This is proof that he is the one who overcomes (Mt 19:28; Rv 22:1-2).

&gt;God’s new kingdom, Shinchonji, is created through this group of twelve tribes.  The twelve tribes of New Spiritual Israel created by God did not exist prior to today, and it is a new work of creation.  It is the only kingdom and temple of God in this world.

&gt;Zion Christian Mission Center, which is a free bible center (Rv 22:17), is the place where those who have been harvested are sealed with the new word (new song), that is, the word of revelation which explains how the prophecies have been fulfilled. It is also the place which creates the twelve tribes.  Therefore, this is the place where the throne of the spiritual world and God are with.  This is the only place in the whole world that teaches this new song, which is the word of revelation.

That's a creepy cult, ladies and gentlemen.  The Honorary Chairman of Mannam is the Pastor who ""became the New Spiritual Israel"", is ""the one who overcomes"", and runs a bible center that is ""the only place in the whole world that teaches this new song, which is the world of revelation.""

What is the connection between Mannam Volunteer Association and Shinchonji Church?  What are they hiding from us?

I am a college student living in Wonju. The other day, I left my one room to go to the 편의점--I was gone about 5 minutes (and I knew I would only be gone for so long, so I left my door unlocked..after all I am in a safe city in a safe country!).
When I left I saw a guy around my age smoking outside the first floor--didn't think anything of it.

I come back and that same guy I saw smoking is IN MY DOORWAY. I am stunned and mostly freeze...I say hello in English and ask him what he's doing in Korean. At first he said that he wanted to talk to me INSIDE my house and explain, but I said no, let's go outside. He was speaking really quietly and kind of mashed together, so it was hard for me to make out his words, so all I really heard was ""외국인"", ""힘들어"" and ""범죄인 아니에요"" and something with a similar meaning to ""나쁜 뜻이 아니에요."". (He only spoke Korean to me).
 
All I could really say was to not do it again ""다시 안하세요"". 

When I went back in my room, I saw that my picture folder was open on my computer (it wasn't before). So when that guy was in my place (how he knew exactly where I live I don't know) he was looking at my pictures on my computer.

He came back like 30 minutes later and gave me a can of beer and some chips.

This guy goes to me school and lives in the same building as me.  I have no idea what to make of this or what to do...

Advice??

Tl;dr: Guy living in my building walked into my place when I was gone and was looking at my photos on my computer. Didn't really get a good reason or an apology out of him.

**Final voter turnout:** 75.8% ... wow, that's amazing!

**Vote tally:** At 10.25pm Park 51.6% leads against Moon 47.9%. Approximately 69% votes have been counted, meaning 10 million votes remain. Park has a lead of 760,000 votes. It's going to be hard for Moon to breech that gap.

I'll make this quick. My name's Brad and I've been an English instructor in Korea for roughly seven years. In all of that time I don't ever recall coming across an English storybook for kids about Korea. So, I just completed my first children's book: Baekgu with Brown Spots. 

It's loosely based on how my dog went from being a homeless pup in rural Korea to being here with me in Seoul. I wrote and illustrated the whole thing, the entire story is translated into Korean at the back, it's affordable, I'll ship it anywhere, and I think Korean kids will get a kick out of it (attn: English teachers and parents).

Check out www.baekguwithbrownspots.com and let me know what you think.

Cheers.

If you add sites or specific recruiters that you've had good experiences with I'll add them to the main portion of this and update it periodically when I feel like I need a distraction (which has been quite often as of late :P). I've never taught ESL full-time in Korea so I'm not really sure about resources for that, so please feel free to make suggestions. Also, feel free to disagree with my descriptions of sites and suggest additions, I'll edit them according to consensus. Oh, if there are any sites for specific sectors, I can label them as such as well.

*Visas*

""Foreign nationals must have a work visa in order to work in Korea. Work visas are usually valid for up to three years, starting from the date of issue. Work visas can be obtained in the applicant’s home country with a sponsorship of the employer in Korea. Foreign nationals residing in Korea must obtain the work visa from a Korean embassy or consulate outside Korea."" from visitkorea.or.kr

[Non-E2 Work Visa Descriptions](http://www.korealaw.com/sub/information/boardView.asp?brdIdx=49&amp;mode=view&amp;brdId=investment)

**Teaching**

* [Dave's ESL](http://www.eslcafe.com/): Forums for discussion and postings of jobs. Forums can be very helpful but are also often characterized as being full of bitter ex-pats.
* [Work 'n' Play](http://worknplay.co.kr/): Lots of job postings for part-time and full-time jobs under the ""Jobs"" headings.
* [Korea4Home](http://www.korea4home.com/sitemap.asp): Lots of job postings among other offerings.


**Non-Teaching**

* [MyJobs](http://www.myjobs.kr/en/nortp.aspx): Lots of postings for mostly business and professional jobs. Often require some sort of experience in the specific fields.
* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/): A sort of Facebook for professionals. You need to create an account to have access. You can post your experience and create connections to others on the network. Many job postings in Seoul.
* [USA Jobs](https://www.usajobs.gov/): Listings for jobs put up by the US government. Many postings in Korea and other regions of the world.
* [Work 'n' Play](http://worknplay.co.kr/): Typically lists teaching jobs but it is worth checking for the occasional non-teaching job that is posted. Non-teaching jobs on this site often still revolve around education though.
* [Seoul Global Center](http://global.seoul.go.kr): Seems to be a wide variety of jobs posted in the Working -&gt; Find Jobs section
* [KOPRA](http://www.kopra.org/index.php): Lots of internships and some jobs.

Bong Joon Ho (Memories Murder, The Host, Mother) is one of the most talented directors out there. His films are genre bending, featuring uncomfortable grey morality, black humor, study of human nature, and political allegories. But, perhaps his biggest strength is that his films are accessible and fun to watch for everyone, unlike most auteurs of his talent. This is going to be an intelligent unique blockbuster, supported by an A list cast. 

Unlike the other two English films by Korean directors this year, this one is written by him and produced by Park Chan Wook (Oldboy), suggesting full reign of creative control. 

It's a nice privilege to watch it before the rest of the world gets to.

I've been in Korea for a total of eight years and haven't had this happen yet. 

Anyway, he didn't pay my last month's salary and severence. When I came back from my home country to become a student, he still hadn't paid me. The guy is a nut and thinks he's above the law. When I lived in his apartment, he refused to pay rent because he didn't know the difference between key money and a deposit (he thought his 5mil deposit would cover rent indefinitely) so I was evicted three times and he had to keep putting me up in new apartments.

He blocked my phone numbers when I came back and blocked me on Kakaotalk. Instead of going there in person (he has a very short temper), I called him from payphones at times I knew he'd be at the reception desk and asked him why he wasn't paying. At first he said he'd pay me shortly... later he said he didn't have to pay, that there was nothing making him pay, and he said if I went to the labour board/police, he still wouldn't pay and would have me deported (he said he'd make something up as I did nothing wrong). His father is stinking rich and foots the bill for everything, even his entire hagwon (it's been losing money forever because he can't get new students). 

I went to the labour board, told them everything, gave them all my records and what not. They said he legally has to pay me but they also said that he blocked their phones and when they summon him to go to the labour board, he won't show up. They don't seem to be able to force him into doing anything. 

The next step is court but I know him well enough to know that he won't show up then either and if he does, it'll only be if he's dragged and even then, I know he'll still try to weasel out of paying me. 

I'm a bit worried. The last time this happened was when I was working in Canada as a university student and the security company I was working for successfully weaseled their way out of paying me what they owed me. Could this happen here? I don't really trust the law to be upheld here at all. Could he just bribe them off, or keep not showing up to the point where they just stop asking him?",,False,self,t5_2qiog,1370831120.0,,,True,t3_1g0pa0,http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/1g0pa0/hagwon_ripped_me_off_went_to_the_labour_board_can/,

Of course, the links between Mannam and the SCJ are well known. However, my experience is a little different. I had never seen or heard anything about Mannam until two months after I started attending the class.

Most people seem to run into these guys on the subway or out in the street somewhere. I guess where I live there not so much into that. Anyways, I joined a local korean class which was geared towards foreigners. Now, I come to find out these are designed to get foreigners to join their group. Another thing they do is cooking classes which are scheduled to start soon as well ironically. Anyways, I went to the Korean class for about two months once a week. It seemed normal. Then, I got invited to the big rally at Seoul Grand Park a couple weeks ago. I thought it was no big deal. I was told it was a peace rally for foreigners standing up against the North Koreans. Well, there was no North Korean talk, but there was a lot of talk about peace. It was really a bunch of speeches that were really vague, could apply to anyone but really didn't mean anything. It seemed odd but I didn't question anything. We were in a public space free to leave, kind of..I had come on a bus with my group so I had to stick with them for the duration of the event. Overall, I was just glad it was a nice day and thankful to experience nature.

Fast forward to last night. Someone posted on facebook about cults in Korea. The video was from the same bogus peace rally that I attended and the guy was being harassed by Mannam people for recording the event. I messaged the person who brought up the video and they told me the leader of the korean class I was attending is a Mannam member. Another person he knows who volunteers is a self devout SCJ member. Also, I found a picture with all of the volunteers from the class doing the ""light"" hand sign. From other blogs and sources, its pretty much confirmed that these classes are set up to lure foreigners in which is why I probably won't be going back. 

To me, there is something uncomfortable about the whole thing. I don't know enough right now about the SCJ and all of their beliefs. Normally, I would be ok with hanging it with people of different faiths. But the fact that Mannam is tricking foreigners into attending rallies and then taking pictures of them which can be used in their videos is under handed. 

Mannam has also gained access to the US Army Base. They are working with volunteer organizations on the base. Overall, I'm just very skeptical and cautious of this whole thing. Most people would say its not a big deal. They just have different beliefs, but they are not upfront about who they are. I know they have gained access to the Army base because I did a volunteer job with Mannam and the soldiers. They have been growing really fast.  

Again, they are getting bigger and offering services attractive to foreigners. They are not honest about what Mannam is. I'm not posting to this scare everyone or slam people. Just keep an eye out.

You are always meeting people here at subway stop / exit number. It usually works out ok but its good to have a way to communicate while en route. I looked into renting a cell phone for my month visit and it was scary. The fees were almost $10 USD/day and it made me nervous that they could charge me whatever if I didn't understand the contract.

Solution:

I have a US cell phone with the data plan deactivated. Yours wouldn't need to be deactivated, just turn on airplane mode (cuts mobile tower connections) and then turn on wifi. I have friends here in Seoul as part of the EPIK program and I was already using Kakao/Voxer/WhatsApp/Skype to talk to them and all my other global friends. If you don't know what the first three are, just imagine text messaging over data plans/wifi. If you are visiting anyone here, they have Kakao. All the trains have Olleh Wifi so just go into any Ministop/GS25/7-Eleven once you land (they exist in the airport) and pick up a couple wifi codes. Just ask for ""Olleh Wifi"", it might take a bit but they'll get it. You can pay ￦1100 for 1 hour or ￦3300 for 24 hours. Then, when you board a train or are standing on the platform just go to any website, Olleh's website comes up, choose enter prepaid code, a little box will come up asking for your code, enter it and your name, passport number and email and voila, wifi! Then, you can Vox/Kakao/WhatsApp friends or call businesses over Skype. Its blazing fast. Its also helpful generally for googling things, etc.

Please note I always have to click in &amp; out of the little code box for it to work right. Don't start typing if there are still alphabet characters in it or you get stuck in this crazy error loop. Also, it saves my name/email/passport number on my phone which makes it fast.

TL;DR Use Skype/Voxer/WhatsApp/Kakao over Wifi on the trains with a prepaid wifi card.",,False,self,t5_2qiog,False,,,True,t3_16rzo7,http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/16rzo7/tip_for_avoiding_cell_phone_rental_in_seoul_south/,

The best one (in my opinion) is [Heaven's Above](http://www.heavens-above.com/PassSummary.aspx?satid=25544&amp;lat=37.56667&amp;lng=127&amp;loc=Seoul&amp;alt=34&amp;tz=UCTm9).

The ""brightness"" is in magnitude, which means that more negative numbers are brighter. Even in downtown Seoul you should definitely be able to see it when it's at -1 or below. The other thing to look at is the ""Alt"" of the Highest Point - that tells you how high in the sky it goes. If it only goes to 30 degrees, you might not see it above the apartment building nextdoor, for instance.

So for this week in and around Seoul, we have a pretty decent pass from 8:30-8:35pm tonight (Monday), getting about 50 degrees above the ground. But tomorrow (Tuesday) at 7:44pm we have a glorious 83 degree high pass (almost straight overhead!) that gets right down to a magnitude of -3.4. However, it looks like it'll rain Tuesday, so tonight might be our best bet.

Happy new (lunar) year! I hope y'all are enjoying the holidays. 

In response to some of the recent posts that have popped up on /r/Korea, we feel that it is necessary to be a little stricter and a little more clear on our moderation.

You guys have been awesome reporting links and we really appreciate the participation in keeping /r/Korea the best it can be. :)

***

Here are some ground rules that seem to have become a little muddled over time.

1. Posts not pertaining to Korea from accounts less than a month old will be deleted without prior notice. Repeat offenders may be banned from /r/Korea without warning. 

2. If you're cross-posting material from other subs or posting potentially viral material, please use the search function or scroll the first few pages. There have been a lot of repeat materials as of late -- we'd like to keep that down where possible. :) 

3. Please follow [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) when posting or commenting. Unnecessarily excessive amounts of swearing or rude behaviour is strongly discouraged. **If you encounter these people in /r/Korea, downvote and move on. Don't feed the trolls.** 

4. Please do NOT ask, ""I'm moving to Korea for a few days / teach, tips?"" These threads literally pop up twice a week and buries the other original content or discussions regarding Korea. Use the sidebar, search bar, or just scroll a few pages. 

5. If your question about Korea can be answered within 5 minutes on Google, it is **NOT** for this subreddit. /r/Korea is not your personal search engine. Unless you're in a very unique situation (and ""I want to teach in Korea, WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?"" is not a unique situation), please do some research before asking legitimate questions that only people with experience in Korea can answer. 

6. The 'report' button is **not a super-downvote.** Just because you don't like the content doesn't mean the mods will remove it. Hide it for yourself if it offends you. 

7. Posts from new accounts often get caught in the spam filter. A lot of these are great posts and even though the mods try, we sometimes miss a few. Please let us know if your post hasn't appeared on the subreddit -- don't be afraid to message the mods! (Please include a link to your post or the title of the post when messaging us.) We can't read through every single submission!

8. Posts asking, ""I WANT TO MOVE TO KOREA FOR STARCRAFT / LOL / E-SPORTS LAWL TELL ME EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW"" will be immediately deleted. 

9. Spam posts or excessive posting will be controlled. Please refrain from making more than 2 posts per day. **Users posting more than 3 per day will get a notice and may be banned from posting in the future. 

10. Unnecessarily negative or offensive comments that is specifically aimed towards a Redditor or others may be deleted without warning. Repeat offenders will be banned. 

11. Posts with profanity that is not a part of linked article will be removed.

12. Personal attacks and links to Facebook, regardless of who it is linked to, will result in an **immediate** ban. 

Those are some of the things we'd like to clarify.

I don't live in a big city. As a westerner it's my cultural view that it is an expression of the highest dislike, disdain, and disgust possible to show someone you may or may not know. Essentially, what will happen is one of the following: I'll sit down in a room and a Korean man from across a room will pass by me and suck air in through his teeth loudly while glaring at me, a Korean man will enter a room - notice me then suck in air through his teeth loudly, or while walking past a Korean man on a street he will glance sideways at me and do the same thing with his teeth loudly. Always directly next to me whilst passing or across from me while looking at me. It is 100% directed at me personally and very obviously so.

I have my suspicions that this is basic rudeness (among other things specifically racially related). Any actual Koreans have any insight? I want Koreans' cultural perspective on this one.

So I just got home from Korea after visiting my brother, who teaches english in Ulsan. Before arriving I honestly didn't know very much about the culture/food/anything else. I did some research but I couldn't make the claim that I was knowledgable about anything Korean.

Anyways! Before going to Korea I had been on a bit of a diet/workout plan, and decided to throw it all out the window so I could just eat and do anything I want in Korea. So for over three weeks I basically drank a ridiculous amount of beer and ate many Korean food (WHICH IS AMAZING BTW! WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL ME). I arrived home today to expect to get on the scale and see that I've gained a bunch of weight.. I didn't actually notice any major change in my body though so I was hoping I hadn't gained too much.. And then I discover that I had somehow lost roughly 3kg. As someone who had been previously trying very hard to lose some weight, through diet and exercise, and the progress was coming slowly.. Then eating Korean food and drinking beer for several months somehow made me lose weight.. baffling.

What the hell is in your food?! How.. Did his happen?

Hop in any taxi and you're likely to see at least one of the following:

* No seatbelts
* Speeding
* Watching TV whilst driving
* Going through red lights
* Ignoring lanes
* Extreme tailgating

...and usually it's all six.

It's no surprise that Korea has almost double the road fatalities than the US, and four times that of Japan. ([Source](http://imgur.com/Zp6JL))

When I suggest to my Korean friends, ""Hey you should probably put on your seatbelt"" they laugh. To them, seatbelts are a mere serving suggestion on the back of a microwavable dinner. Nobody *really* takes it seriously.

One of our teachers is leaving to go on a trip with his family, so we have an opening over here in Incheon.

As for our branch, we're a small, close branch in Bupyeong, Incheon. All the foreign teachers and Korean teachers have a good relationship, so we're looking for someone that can fit in well. The job would start on August 26th and continue for a year with the option to re-sign if you love it like us (I've been here 3 years). 

At the current time, I'm looking for a teacher currently in Korea with his/her papers in order. (others can apply, but those here will be given preference, sorry). Chungdahm experience is preferred, but by no means required as we train. That's about it.

If anyone is interested, please send me a message and we can talk about details, interviews and such. Just wanted to help out the community that has helped out me. Thanks everyone!

I studied two years of martial arts back in high school (A Hawaiian style called Kajukenbo) and am currently enrolled in another dojo (Karate, been doing that for the last two years as well).

I'm enjoying it and would really like to continue overseas, but I have no idea how foreigners are treated in that respect. I understand KWD is big over there and would love to expand my horizons.

What are the differences between a typical American dojo and Korean dojo? How are foreigners treated? Are there dojos that teach in English? Anything else I should be aware of?

1358916558.0,25,self.korea,173svf,"/r/Korea, let's talk burgers",,27,2,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/173svf/rkorea_lets_talk_burgers/,"As an American, I'm a big fan of all beef patties between two baked buns with cheese and veg. I've checked out places here and there and so I thought I'd compile a list and add my thoughts on each. Some of these haven't been to in awhile, so I'm sorry in advance if the prices are vague.

**Burger B**: This is my favorite burger place in Seoul. Great taste, fresh ingredients, good selection of beers and multiple locations (I've only been to the Hongdae location though). My only gripe would be that french fries are not included with the sandwich, but they can be had for 4,000 won or so for a side. Burger, beer and fries comes out to about 15,000 won. Pretty sure the reason this place is my favorite though is because they carry the Indica IPA, which is delicious if you like IPAs. They also carry Alley Cat beer along with other beers typical of Korean bars.

**Brooklyn, The Burger Joint**: Brooklyn offers a variety of burgers that have great taste and fresh ingredients. I'd say the taste of some sandwiches can be better than Burger B, but getting there for me sucks, so it's not my favorite. It's in 서래마을 (Seorae Maeul, the ""French Quarter"" of Seoul) and you can cab or walk from the subway, but it's a bit of a ways (particularly for a 강복'er). The place is small, so you'll likely have to wait. That being said, the place has delicious burgers and amazing milkshakes. I think it was like 15,000-20,000 per person when I last went, depending on the drink.

**All American Diner**: A main staple of Itaewon and is the place to go for a greasy diner burger. I think the burger was like 11,000 won or something like that, and it was a good burger, but nothing to write home about.

**J's Burgers**: This was in Ilsan near 백석역 (Baeksuk Station) a few years ago, not sure if it still is, hopefully though! Great tasting burgers and sandwiches, but a bit on the pricey side, like 12,000-15,000 won for just the sandwich if my memory serves me correctly. Has a bit of notoriety though because the proprietors are a Korean K-pop singer, [제이](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_%28singer%29), and her mother.

**Yaletown**: Small bar in 신촌 (Shinchon) that is supposedly run by two Korean-Americans. They have a nice American style burger that can really hit the spot and I remember it being like 9,000 or 10,000 won with fries. Cool little bar with beer pong tables. I'd say this is a good choice if you're looking for food to go with your drink as opposed to the other way :p

**W Burger**: A burger chain that makes decent burgers. Reminds me a bit of like a Ruby Tuesdays' burger or something. Nothing you'd expect to be amazing, but will satisfy hunger and burger cravings. I think it was like 12,000 - 15,000 won for a burger set (fries and drink).

**Kraze Burger**: Another burger chain in Korea that is very popular among Koreans, but I think this place is pretty meh. The burgers aren't terrible, but you typically end up paying like 15,000 won for a burger, fries and a drink but are still hungry afterwards (at least I am). Their burgers are like extra-large sliders with vegetables. The vegetables are nice and fresh though.

**Burgermine**: I've yet to actually go here, but I've heard good things. It's near Noksapyung station and Haebongchon. I've heard it's 15,000 won for fries, drink and a ticket to the burger bar, which is basically an all-you-can-eat buffet bar where you can make your own burger. If I go in the near future, I'll update.

**Fast-food and others**: Anything from a convenience store is going to not be good. Some of the random burger sellers on the street in Itaewon and other areas have great drunk burgers, not sure how they taste when sober though... Burger King is still the best burger, McDonald's has awesome french fries and the Shanghai Spice, but that's chicken. Lotteria sucks. Lotteria's only redeeming quality is that they have these little shake pouches to add different flavor to your french fries.

If anyone knows of others, feel free to share!

I've been living with my Korean girlfriend (i'm not Korean) for a couple of years now. We met in college, and we're taking a vacation to Hawaii together (actually for a wedding). I'm planning on proposing to her in Hawaii, but I'd like to get her parents' permission first. However, while they've been supportive of our relationship, they don't speak much English. Does anyone here have any suggestions on how to go about asking them for permission for their daughter's hand in marriage? Unfortunately, I don't speak Korean, but so far my best bet has been to write a letter and then have it translated into Korean... They live pretty far away, so it's not feasible for me to go to them in person, but I figure this would be the next best option, since communicating directly with them is somewhat difficult. If anyone has experience in Korean translations, or could point me in the direction of a trusted professional service, or has any other suggestions, I'd be forever in your debt!


Dear Mr. &amp; Mrs. xxx,

I am sorry that I am not able to tell you this in person, but I hope that you will accept my sincere feelings in this letter. For the past seven years I have had the honor of knowing your daughter. During that time, I have been fortunate enough to discover what a truly kind and compassionate person she is. Nothing in this world brings me as much joy as seeing her smile. She has had a tremendous impact on my life, and without her, I would be a completely different person. She has been my best friend throughout difficult times and I cannot imagine life without her.

As you know, later this month, we will be traveling to Hawaii. During our vacation there, I plan to propose to your daughter. I respectfully and sincerely ask for your blessing. I hope you would allow me and find me worthy to marry your daughter. Thank you for your support in our relationship thus far, and I hope to use this opportunity to bring our families together.

Yours Truly,

This morning he got into a cab from Incheon Airport, and when he got out, the cab left with his bag inside (unintentionally). The bag contained all the money he brought with him for his trip, $5000 in cash, and a USB that contained all his mission statements. The brown bag was about the size of a Kindle, it also contained some cologne, a comb, and a cleaner for glasses. 

If anyone could relay anything helpful, even the name of some popular cab companies in Korea that may have been likely to pick him up from the airport, it would mean so much--my family doesn't have much money, my mom supports both herself and my father working as a teacher's aid at a high school; this loss has really hit them hard. Also my dad had a stroke about ten years ago and to be honest I'm very concerned about the way this stress is going to affect his health. 

I know reddit is not a huge fan of Christians, or really any religious person, but my father is a good man--he is earnest, hard working, and the best dad I ever could have hoped for, and I cannot stand seeing this happen to him with no idea of how to help. So please, if anyone has any information that might be of assistance, let me know. Thank you.

I'm assuming as you guys are all fluent in English and browse reddit, most of you were brought up somewhere outside of Korea.




Coming from a lifetime in a western country straight into the ROK military can be a jarring experience, and I thought it would be cool if we could talk about are times in the service, share some stories...etc.


Also, if there are kids out there who are like us and are considering joining the ROK military, they can ask us questions. I know I would have loved a resource like this before I had signed up to ship out to Nonsan. 


I guess I'll start. (long post, TLDR at bottom)


I grew up in the States, in rural Indiana for most of my life. I have acceptable Korean, almost fluent but can't talk very fast or use advanced vocab. I moved back and forth to Korea a few times in my life but never for long. I was going to University here and my grades were shit (got academic probation) and hated my major. My parents said maybe I should join the ROK Army and get some sense knocked into me. I thought it would be a good experience too. (Be all you can be, Army strong, you know?)


Feb 2009 I flew to Korea and went to Nonsan to start my training. No specialty MOS.. just as a 1111 소총수. The first week I was there, they did a aptitude screening and obviously I scored very high in English. Apart from that, the Drill Instructors there didn't give a shit that I grew up in the states and I got the exact same treatment as all the other recruits. About 2 weeks in it kinda dawned on me that the ROKA wasn't anything like the US Army which I'd been seeing commercials and movies about my entire life.


When I graduated boot camp, they changed my MOS to 3111.E (English translator/interpreter) and shipped me off to bumfuck Changwon. It's a little industrial city about 30 minutes west of Busan. I'm not going to say exactly what base it was (정보통신보안 ㅋ) but the enlisted presence there was very small. We had 2 undersized companies, so around 200 enlisted personnel. Being in the rear, we had very strict 똥군기. Basically, it's stupid 군기 that is mostly pointless. I think that the mentality was that because our post wasn't a physically demanding place like the DMZ, the senior enlisted guys thought that they should keep us in check by applying mental strain instead. Corporal punishment was very much still alive and kicking, and the first few months as a 이등병 were pretty rough. I remember being kicked in the back while I was squaring away(literally your blanked needed to have a 90 degree angle 각!) my 모포 sitting cross-legged, because apparently, you're supposed to do that shit while kneeling. I did the invisible chair stress position a few times while standing post at night because I couldn't memorize all the 군번s of everyone in the company, the 10대 군가s and 초병의일반수칙. I couldn't use the PX or internet room(싸지방) until I was a PFC, etc.. the list goes on. Also, the menial tasks I had to perform was endless. Basically cleaning gross shit all the time (scrubbing urinals with a hand sponge and no gloves, anyone?) and being pretty much a slave to the senior guys, doing their laundry and cleaning up after them.. lol


Moreover, I never really got to translate much. I only spent a few hours at my ""work"" a day because I had to go stand post(each shift is 2 hrs, 1.5 in the winter) twice a day and we had some sort of training exercise or march at least once a month.


Needless to say the first few months I wasn't a happy camper.

 
I think a lot of the issues did stem from the fact that western culture is inherently different from Korean culture. Western countries have more lax hierarchy and everyone seems to be more on the same level. In Korea, hierarchy is everything and the entire respect system revolves around seniority (not only age but how long you have been doing something for..)  For me, at first anyway, it was hard to take orders for somebody who had enlisted 1 month prior to me and salute them. It felt insulting or something. However, eventually I got the hang of it and just kinda developed a different version of me. I had the normal me, who was a normal college kid and the ROKA soldier me. Once I was in the persona, I had no problem fitting in.


Once I started putting my time in, I eventually got to the midpoint of the corporal rank (상꺾) which is widely accepted as the time when you are considered ""senior"" enlisted. As long as you weren't a shitbag during your time as PVT and PFC (respect is earned, not given), You can basically order your privates around and you can do anything you want around the barracks for the most part. Want something from the PX and don't wanna leave the room? Send a private. Squad bay looking dirty? Make the privates scrub down the floors with brushes. Even the 병장s will now recognize that you've earned your ""짬""(salt) and accept you as part of their senior club. By this time, I had spent more than a year with most of them anyway so everyone was pretty buddy buddy and the hierarchy was very relaxed. I ended up being good friends with guys 3-4 months senior to me that used to smoke me when I used to be a private.


Eventually, I made sergeant, and would spend my days lurking around the barracks trying to not get sent to work. It's kinda funny because when I was a private, I really wanted to go to work and translate but when I was a sergeant, I hated going. I would volunteer for 작업(working parties) whenever they were available and just chill outside and shoot the shit with the other guys while the privates and PFCs did most of the work..lol! Hands down the last few months were the best.


Finally by Christmas of 2011, I walked out of the base gate with a 개구리(Reservist patch.. does anyone know why the fuck these are called 개구리s? Nobody in our company knew..I thought because they looked a like a frog maybe..) embroidered on my left chest pocket. I flew back to the states not even a week after my EAS(End of Active Service) and started school again the week after. I had quite a bit of a culture shock again, as the ROKA 병장 persona had taken over almost completely. I would see freshmen chewing gum with their legs crossed in front of the professor during lecture and would get pissed and think '저 개새끼봐라 조또 빠져가지고...' and realized that I was not in the army anymore or even Korea for that matter and it was okay to act like that here. I still woke up at 6AM everyday for a good semester after my EAS and went on runs. Sometimes if nobody was around I would even sing cadence to myself (moto!)... I'd say it took me a good year to get my normal persona back.


In retrospect, even though at first it was a shit experience, I think that my time in the ROKA was definitely a positive experience for me. I learned to appreciate the life I had here in the states more than anything, and I learned to not take anything for granted. I have gotten pretty much straight As in school since and gotten my shit together. Also, because I've experienced all this nasty shit like bootcamp, doing demeaning shit for months, training, 유격, and a few 30km full gear marches, I feel like that whenever something shitty happens in real life I can be like..'Oh this sucks but not as bad as that time when I had to duckwalk around the soccer field all night because the retard private I was standing post with had a negligent discharge...' Weirdly, it also made me super patriotic and now I fly a Korean flag patch on my backpack. 


Some nights when I'm sitting at home doing nothing, I reminisce about my time in the Army. I actually do miss it, all the good parts and bad. There was something there that civilian life doesn't have. It was the only really ""worry free"" time of my adult life. I mean there were things you had to worry about, but it was stupid shit, like.. 'oh fuck I'm gonna get smoked tomorrow by the staff sergeant because so and so didn't get done..' and not important stuff like 'oh fuck if I don't get this internship I'm probably not going to get a job..'


Anyways, I would totally do it again if I could!


TL:DR - My time in the ROKA was shit but in retrospect it helped me out in life and I miss it.

As with many such schools, there was a plastic fish tank full of resident hamsters for the kids to look at and learn from, and they would burrow around in a layer of wood shavings to form a warm hamster ball.

The only problem with hamsters is that they are excrement and urine producing machines. I was most impressed at their water/food throughput rate—those furry little critters went at soiling their nest with gusto—and accordingly, their wood shavings would get somewhat “fragrant” at times.

The Korean kindergarten teachers would therefore have to change the wood shavings, a seemingly simple operation. There was, however, one massive obstacle to this undertaking. They were, to a woman, terrified of the hamsters. Who knew what evil lurked in the hearts of those dumpling-sized beasts?

One day at about 2:00 pm I received a delegation of pretty young kindergarten teachers, imploring me to help them with “big problem on floor one.” I went willingly enough and discovered a smelly tank full of the scariest animals on earth—Hamsters. I had been elected hamster wrangler, chief rodent catcher, Trapper PDKL45—Hamster Man.

The first hamster catchin’ session was a fiasco, a veritable hamster circus or wild hamster rodeo, much to the delight of the middle-aged male Korean bus drivers. The hamsters would see my hands coming and scuttle away, until I would finally seize one of the little beasts and cup it between two hands to deposit it into a temporary hamster holdin’ pen.

It was then that inspiration hit.  I got a small paper coffee cup, and with a threatening hand behind, would drive the quivering little grey critters into the cup one at a time, to be swiftly placed into the little hamster jail.

It was only a few days later and I was getting a coffee at Starbucks. I casually looked at their Grande sized paper cups, smiling when I thought of their hamster-carrying capacity. I was seized with inspiration. The Starbucks people happily gave me a few empty cups when I offered to buy some, and, armed with the 475 ml paper cups I put on my desk at work, I became a hamster herding machine, able to shift industrial quantities of hamsters in mere seconds.

It was a golden time in many respects. I became a hamster herding legend, spoken of in hushed tones of awe by hamster herders across the Asian continent. Where hamster herders gather to share tales of the thrill of the chase, my name is still on their lips. PDKL45: The Master Hamster Herder of Muge 1 Dong.

Sadly, my hamster herding career came to a premature end when the hamsters were all given away to students for free a few months later and tadpoles took their place.

Phone: I have a GSM smartphone. Can I use a prepaid or short term (6 mo) contract to use it and just swap SIMs when I need? Do the prepaid phones have English keyboards/interfaces?

Language: I'm following advice I've seen here and putting my immediate efforts on learning Hangul. I'm loving it so far. Once I get Hangul down, how long should it take to get at least acceptably broken Korean down? Obviously fluency takes years, but I just mean survival and very light conversational competence.

Driving: I'll be getting my IDL before I leave and my work will have me covered with a rental and insurance, but if I want to purchase some oddball used car (I'm a car guy) for my stay, what hoops do I need to jump through? Can I use my American insurance, or do I need to go through a Korean company? Also, I've heard driving in Korea can be hectic. I'm not so worried about he other drivers, but how prevalent are traffic police and what is their threshold for caring about how you drive? Is speeding heavily discouraged or grossly overlooked? What are the penalties?

Food: I'm really open to anything, but are there any watch outs for things that foreigners just can't/don't like/tolerate?

Community: are there any groups/communities of foreigners in Yeosu I should know about for socialization and support? I'll have my coworkers, but having people outside of work would make this feel like less of a business trip.

I know it's a long shot as these things hardly ever work out. Still, we are faced with a choice. So, I come to you, my fellow redditors. Where should my wife and I choose to live in Korea?


We are fairly reserved people who like nerdy things like board games, roller derby, dagorhir and humans vs. zombies. Neither of us drink, though not for religious reasons, so the usual expat bar scene will likely not be our thing. I have a masters degree, and my wife is considering going back for a masters sometime soon as well. We are both open to the idea of staying in Korea for an extended period of time, or moving on to a different location in asia. We are almost certainly not going 'back home to America' in the foreseeable future.
 

I'm from a large-ish Midwestern city, my wife is from a rural area. We know we don't want to be in Seoul, we know we won't get hired in Busan, and would prefer someplace further south to help take the edge off of winter.
 

Places currently on our list include:

* Daegu

* Changwon

* Gwangju

* Jeonbuk

* Ulsan

Also, all of the curries are pretty good, especially the Aloo gobi.

I cannot recommend this place highly enough, and there is another branch in Yeongdempo (that I have not been to).

To get there take exit 3 from Dongdaemun station. You will exit and see a Woori bank on the left, just after the exit. Turn left into the alley immediately after the bank and about 10 meters up you will see a phone store on the right, just past another Nepalese/Indian restaurant also on the right.

I think these little quirks are incredibly fascinating and fun to learn. It might be helpful to know some of these manners, whether it be to impress an employer/girlfriend/friend/etc or to just learn.

So help me compile a comprehensive list of all these mannerisms. Here's what I think I've learned so far:

* We all know that the way you speak Korean is incredibly important.

* It's impolite to ask for things directly. And it is especially against tradition to speak openly about money. Business gets tricky, as I'm sure this subreddit will be more than gladly to tell you about.

* Check the degree of your bow when greeting someone, ranging from a series of small head bows all the way to getting-on-your-knees-bow.

* Shake hands using both hands or touch the left hand to your right arm.

For drinking alcohol:

* When drinking alcohol, their glass must never be empty and they must never pour for themselves. 

* When you pour for them, make sure to pour with 2 hands and to hide the label.

* If they slightly raise their glass while you're pouring that's a sign to stop pouring.

* You can not decline a drink. 

* When an older person is pouring for you, you must hold the glass with 2 hands. Depending on how drunk or close you are to the pourer, hold the glass with one hand with your second hand either touching the other glass, your hand, your wrist, different parts of your arm, your shoulder or your chest/stomach.

* When ingesting alcohol in front of any older person, hide the alcohol entering your mouth (either with your hand or by turning away or both).

When eating:

* When eating with an older person don't use your left hand for anything. Keep it by your side, not on the table. (Also as an extension of this rule: don't be left handed *hehehe*)

* Do not eat any of the dishes before the most respected person has taken from it (even side dishes).

* It might be considered rude to the person who cooked if you drink water or tea while eating. 

* Never stab any food with your chopsticks to pick it up.

* It's okay, and actually encouraged, to slurp noodles.

* When having very spicy food, it's known for people to make loud grunting sounds.

* Apparently there is a wrong way to hold chopsticks.

* Your mouth should never touch the plate.

In the end, as foreigners, we are not expected to know or even comply with any of this. However I'm sure it's a nice gesture, especially to dispel any negative vibes sent our way as foreigners.",,False,self,t5_2qiog,1338699211.0,,,True,t3_ui751,http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/ui751/traditions_manners_politeness_manners_a_howto/,

Visited palaces, the shopping streets, ate loads of good food, took many photos, and my friends and I are just shocked at how nice people are in Korea.

We've all been to Japan a few times so we're no strangers to manners, but here in Korea, on the subway trains there are those 3 seats on each side that are for the elderly, and even if the subway car is full and there are people carrying loads of bags, they will not sit on those chairs even if there are no elderly around.

Rush hour is horrible, but much better than what we're used to in Hong Kong.

Food is amazing. I weigh at around 55kg, after these 7 days I am at around 57-58, because of the many meals I eat each day, plus the soju and makgeolli with fried chicken or ddeokbokki at night. 

The PEOPLE ARE AMAZING. I just feel like I have to emphasize this. The below average girls in Korea are the above average girls in Hong Kong, and you can clearly see that looks do not matter as girls date guys shorter than them, and regular-looking guys can get a really nice girlfriend (doesn't really matter if she had surgery). Furthermore, those girls aren't even arrogant or anything like the girls in Hong Kong, as in if I go up to a pretty girl and talk to her and stuff (in English), she'll make an effort to understand me and chat with me. Try to talk to a stranger in Hong Kong and you'll be ignored. 

Went down to Jeonju the other day, many people didn't speak English. But everyone was helpful, taxi drivers charged less than what was shown on the screen, and the food was great.

I'd suggest Daejeon. There is an awesome bar called ""Weizen house"" (I'll add a map tonight/tomorrow). It's 10,000 won for all you can drink and 8000 won for all you can eat salad bar (it's called salad bar, there is TONS of food there, sausage/chicken pasta, fries, whatever). Daejeon is also kind of central so it wouldn't be too hard to get to.

I'm in the middle of my second stay in Korea.  Over these two visits I feel like I've been pretty close to diverse parts of the education system (without having been a teacher here myself).  Right now I'm doing some work at a lower tier four year trade school.  I'm also involved with some government-run education events.  Last year I was at Yonsei in Seoul, which is supposed to be one of the most prestigious institutions.  The experiences in those places are what prompt me to search out some insight from people who might know more than me.

I'm not shocked or upset by Korea's education system, but after all this time I am a little bit confused by it.  When I was in high school my day 8:30am-4:00pm was spent in school, and then after school I usually spent some time in a structured activity (marching band, taekwondo, soccer).  When I wasn't doing either of those I was either relaxing or pursuing the kinds of fleeting hobbies you have when you're 16 years old.  

I have friends who say they never attended a hagwon, but by and large most of my peers say they did.  My current language partner's younger brother who is a junior in high school spends six days per week, 9:00am-10:30pm, at school and study hall since he needs to take the big college entrance exam.

Even without this extra six hours per day of cramming, I don't feel like my American peers are thousands of hours of education behind our Korean counterparts.  (Given, I grew up in a good school district so I can't speak for less privileged areas of the US.)  However, I do feel like my peers in America don't look quite as nauseous when they recall their adolescence.  Even at the college I'm staying at right now students will disappear into their rooms for three and four hours a day for a week frantically studying for a very short test.

*What gives?  Is the time spent studying anything important?  Is all that time really spent studying at all?  I'd love to hear from someone who's been closer to the education system here (or been through it themselves) about the reasoning behind all this study time.*",,False,self,t5_2qiog,False,,,True,t3_1g1n5a,http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/1g1n5a/how_different_are_the_products_of_korean_and/,

I will be finishing my bachelor's degree at my university back in America this coming May.

I'm seriously considering applying for a job teaching english here because the pay and work is good and I also like the country. 

Anyways I got back from dinner tonight and one of my korean friends told me that foreigners in this country who come here to teach english are considered losers.  They're considered losers because it's perceived that they are here because they couldn't 'succeed' in their home country. 

Anyways this line of thought totally turned me off to the idea of teach english in Korea anymore.  Call my ego my worst enemy on this one, but I went through a very tough teenage phase of my life where I was considered a loser, I'd rather not go back there again.

It is, in my opinion, the best English daily. They always have *long* investigative ""Feature"" pieces that are pretty insightful into Korean social issues and aren't the typical foreigner vs korean stuff. No weird alien, celebrity or sex stuff a la the Koreatimes.

You can go way back in their [archive](http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/list/List.aspx?gCat=020101) and find stuff on gambling addiction, drugs, homeless, and one thing I'm very interested in: Koreans' unique twist on modern, urbanized, technology-driven life. They also profile ""unique"" Koreans like a Korean who became successful in a strange way.

For example, here's a piece on how in Seoul, there's a [huge premium placed on which floor you live on due to violence and random noise/drunks](http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2969556). This is the kind of thing unique to a city as dense as Seoul. Also, they always go in depth with stats, interviews, etc and divide the article into different sections that present the problem, flesh it out, then explain how people are trying to solve the problem. Best of all, it's not propaganda or trying to ""promote"" Korea in any way. If anything, it's fair and is critically asking why some things are like this and what is behind it...which is what I want in an article.

Personally, I like to find articles on subjects that I have observed or affect my own life in Korea then see Koreans' take on it. Here's a few examples: 

* [Korean women are the skinniest of all OECD countries](http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2953581)

There are independent bands here, and I've seen a few, especially in Seoul.

My question is, how do I find their albums? My assumption is that they're not quite as into the iTunes iStore over here, and searching for Korean things on the Pirate Bay that aren't K-Pop is kinda fruitless.

I have a girlfriend, my Korean level is up in the intermediate area (since I've been studying a lot this year) and I have quite a few hobbies on the peninsula that take me all over the place. 

In the past year or so, I've begun to feel really self conscious about my age. It started when I was working at my last hagwon and felt like some kind of pariah as I was about three years older than the next person. They often teased me about it and asked me a few times as to why I've been at it for so long. All the younger folk I worked with went back to the US after only teaching for one year here, assured that they will all have high paying jobs within the next year or so (I'm from the poor part of Canada and I know no such future awaits me there). 

I'm totally comfortable here in every other way. I like my job and I like what I do, I just hate my age always being an issue. I even find that my (adult) students are beginning to see me as more of an adjosshi than your typical ESL'er despite my appearance hardly changing in the time that I've been here. When I tell people that I've been here for almost five years, it's like I can feel the level of respect plummeting. 

I'm looking into doing a Master's degree and getting out of the hagwon biz. I'm just a bit curious: am I really too old to be teaching English? Not just here but anywhere? I'm afraid of meeting any other foreigners now for fear I might get made fun of due to my age (for the tenth time).

I have checked several websites, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Hi Korea. I am unable to find how much time I will be able to stay if I obtain a tourist visa at a consulate in the US.

I am wondering if anyone has gotten a ""tourist visa"" and how long they were able to stay in Korea.

This is kind of off topic from Korea, and more of a teaching question, but I thought a lot of you would have some experience with it.

My head teacher (at a kindergarten hagwon) has a problem with yelling at the students until they start to cry, and then she keeps going, thinking it will make it sink in more. So I told her if she makes another one of my students cry, I was going to go home.  She started to tell me that what she did was very normal in Korea. 

I like my  students a lot, and don't want to leave them behind to that kind of treatment (I feel like I have to be a a friendly teacher there who shows the students that he cares about them, instead of the strict  discipline of the Korean teachers.)

The kids are less disciplined when they are with me, and I hope I can make them disciplined enough where the head teacher doesn't notice them.  So I guess my question is, how do you guys control your students?

**TL;DR:** How do you control kindergarteners


Thanks

I have a lot of interest in places I probably wont go to any time soon and I took a lot of interest in South Korea in particular. I find looking at pictures can be a lot of fun so I decided to make a post with some of the good picture galleries I've found of South Korea. I'm trying to give a good amount of variety and sticking to websites that aren't extremely tedious to sort though.

I plan on edditing in more later, but I didn't want to rush through too many at once and have low quality galleries. I'd also really appreciate it if you leave galleries that you've found in the comments since I'm very very far from seeing all the different areas of South Korea. Hopefully you guys enjoy the pictures.

1. [A big collection with lots of variety. Very easy to look at lots of pictures at once.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/seoulkorea/with/8597060248/)

2. [A fairly small gallery of photos, however they are all quite unique and sorting through the photos is smooth.](http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/countries/south-korea-photos/#/tripitaka-koreana_9172_600x450.jpg)

3. [A bunch of nice photos from a wallpaper site. I'm not sure if they are actually all from Korea since the site has no information on the photos, but they are still really nice and relaxing looking photos.](http://www.wallcoo.net/nature/iclickart_8_1024/index2.html)

4. [A few gallerys of nature and temple photos. Smooth to sort through but kind of annoying when you want to look at a larger version since hover zoom doesn't work, but the pictures are nice and show a lot of older architechture.](http://www.travelphotogallery.net/south_korea)

5. [Some pictures from Redditor bloody_hell of Gyeongbok Palace at night. The pictures give a cool impression of you being there with some movement blurs. Some people might not like that but I think it makes them unique.](http://imgur.com/a/SlYtg)

6. [Pictures of Mt.Wolchulsan taken by Redditor RiceAndRamen. A small collection of photos but they are nice quality and have a really nice view of farmland from the top of the mountain.](http://imgur.com/a/mQH7a#6)

7. [A large variety of different galleries from Seoul that have lots of different themes. Pretty slow to look through all the pictures however.](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/south-korea/seoul/images)

8. [A few galleries of different places/themes in South Korea. Lays out all the pictures at once so it's pretty easy to sort through.](http://bayimages.net/photos/korea/)

I have been in a Korean linguistics master's program here for 3 semesters, and it has been the single most disappointing thing I've done my entire adult life. What I'm trying to figure out is whether it is just me and my department, or if other foreign students from Western countries have encountered the same issues. Please keep in mind that what follows is generalized and based mostly on what I've observed and heard:

1. There is little to no interest on publishing anything outside of Korea.

2. There is no driving research focus for the department, and everyone just does their own individual thesis research.

3. Goals and standards for the program (including assignments and tests) are horribly vague.

4. Lack of academic integrity with lots of copying and pasting and no citations.

5. Many students have a weak theoretical background and it shows in the quality of the work.

5. Students seem more concerned about impressing the professors than with actually understanding the material.

Of course this is just the tip of the iceberg for all the difficulties of studying in Korea. The problem is that when it comes down to it, I knew my degree wouldn't matter as much outside of this country. I was hoping that the quality of the education would compensate for this, but I have been less than impressed. The professors are very knowledgeable and helpful, but they seem complacent. I get the feeling that most people are here to get a degree so they can leave and go become professors. No one seems to be interested in doing very meaningful research that fits into the larger field of linguistics. There is some potential here, but not many people seem to care. I'm afraid this might be a reflection of the looks over substance mentality that is rampant over here.

Anyway, if anyone else would care to share their experiences or opinions, I would greatly appreciate it.",,False,self,t5_2qiog,False,,Seoul,True,t3_1dzlk1,http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/1dzlk1/anyone_currently_studying_in_a_graduate_program/,
