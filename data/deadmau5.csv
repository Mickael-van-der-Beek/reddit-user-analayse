Only 50 people will be there... I'm speechless. I'll try to post a pic/ commentary afterward :) 
xoxo 

edit: What an awesome night you guys! I wish every one of you could have been there. It was very *heavily* photographed and recorded, and will be played on KCRW at some point after the first of November. I shall post some pics and videos tomorrow, if you don't see enough all over the internet lol 

Joel was so gracious and amazing. My boyfrient and i were about five feet away from him during the interview, in which he was poignent and well spoken. He put on an amazing set, played for probably an hour and a half and it was so genuine. The stage set up was a miniature box set up, and of course the graphics were rad too. All of the staff was super gracious, and what a bitchin venue too, at an art/music gallery on LaBrea... oh and i can't forget the open bar with select Patron drinks (including a deadmau5 margarita) and a few bottled beers; i had a stella. 

At the very end we went around the side door and he *signed* my boyfriends FeedMe hat and my cell phone case. We also walked away with a few of the amazing posters from the night and of course some deadmau5 glow ears. 
I'm still trying to take it all in, this guy is a legend. I can't wait for you all to hear the interview and see videos of the set! I'd be happy to answer any questions

Kat and I split in November and I moved back home to Toronto. During this time, while we were broken up, I did have relations with another woman. Following that, Kat and I reconciled and I acknowledged being intimate with another person while we were estranged. 

We did move past those issues and I proposed to Kat in mid- December. At the end of June, it was clear that the relationship was not working and we mutually ended the engagement. I was not, at any point, unfaithful to Kat during our time together. 

I don't wish to go tit for tat with these kinds of pronouncements and don't expect to comment further, but I do believe that those who have expressed concern deserve a more complete understanding of what transpired.""

I need some new music to add to it so that I don't get tired of the songs that I love.

I'm hoping you (presumably much younger) guys/girls can help an old fart find some good music to run to.  

To give you an idea of what I like, these are some of my favorites...

Help an old guy find some ""young"" music

The few songs/artists that I recognize out of your responses show me that we are all on the right track. 

Please keep them coming.

Some are soft melodies, like the suites. I will admit listening to his first soundcloud upload last night, when the beat came in I was a little displeased cause it was just a beat not a continuation of the build up. After a few minutes I was thinking, a song like that is exactly what I would want to hear at a club. Dark and minimal. It doesn't try to be a dance floor anthem like all the other artists like fucking Hardwell and Avicii. Plus the newest track he uploaded (fuck a cocecalnth [or however you spell it]) is pretty damn awesome. 

tl;dr, even though his newer style is not the one he had around RAT, he is still going back to his roots being off ultra. His music is good underground-sounding club music.

For those of you who don't know, Neff teamed up with deadmau5 to produce the Neffmau5 clothing line, which has a bunch of really cool stuff. Neff also happens to be one of Joel's favorite brands. 

So I get to work and see that there is a reservation for ""Neff"". I was like ""Oh! What if its Shaun Neff?"" Soon enough, Shaun and 4 other guys walk into the restaurant and sat down and started talking about business. I am the head busser for the restaurant, and kept walking by his table and refilling his drink. He was pretty quite to me, never really said please or thank you. But as he was walking out of the restaurant, I stopped him and said ""Hey Shaun, I just wanted to let you know how much I love your stuff. By far my favorite brand."" He looks at me like ""Oh shit, he knows who I am."" I then said ""Yeah, I love all the Neffmau5 stuff, its pretty freaking cool."" He said ""Yeah, deadmau5, he's a homie."" I asked what he is like. He said ""He's really cool. He's got a bunch of good ideas. I'm actually meeting up with him on Thursday to talk about a new line that I want to do."" I said ""Oh yeah! Now that he's living with Kat in LA, you guys probably get more chances to talk about stuff."" He said ""Nah, Joel's pretty busy, he actually just changed his residency in Las Vegas to MGM Grand, where he'll play every 4 months."" 

After that, I took a picture with him, and he went off on his merry way. I know this isn't the same as meeting Joel, but I thought you guys would still appreciate it. Any questions, ask in comments!

I love the logo and the song so I decided to get some made! The size is 4"" by 4"" and I have plenty.

If you're interested I'm selling them for $5 shipped anywhere!

You can send money to my Paypal (bzivko@gmail.com) and I'll ship them out once a week! Make sure to include your shipping address!

If this does well enough I'll look into getting more designs cut!

-Here's a pretty good story :) I was watching his livestream one day and since I knew he answered a lot of questions via twitter, I decided I should make an account JUST to ask him a question. So I made the account and what was the first question that popped into my head that I should ask him? ""What does blood smell like?"" I hit tweet and only moments later......""What does blood smell like? Pennies. Oh no that's taste........I don't know what blood smells like but I know what blood tastes like, trust me."" 
Haven't lol'd that hard in a long time.

-Seeing his concert in Phx, AZ during his Meowington's Hax Tour 2011 was the fuckin' best day of my life! Not to mention getting secondhand high! :D 

-I first heard him when Minecraft was relatively new and my brother got me hooked on it. He played Strobe while we played and I've been a huge fan ever since. :) 

-I think The Veldt has an excellent back story to how the vocals came along. If you don't know, go look it up. It's inspiring :) haha 

-If I had to pick two songs (one chill, one intense) I would pick Not Exactly for chill and Moar Ghosts 'n Stuff for intense, what about you guys? 

Thanks for reading guys! I'd like to hear your stories, too!

&gt;me, my awareness, and my big mouth.
&gt;The world is and always has been a seemingly scary place. From cavemen too freaked out to go outside at night coz of that fuckin bear or tiger running around eatin shit, to politicians and public figures being very damn careful about the very words out of their mouths in order to keep themselves credible to some degree…
&gt;me?  im not much. im a musician in my 30’s with a privileged lifestyle in terms of most, less concerned therefore less knowledgeable about global issues unless they’re put directly in front of my face. But i am, just like anyone else on earth, awarded with personal views, whether i choose to express them is entirely up to me.
&gt;As a species, were pretty far from perfect. It seems our cultures are divided up into separate planets in some cases. We all have different systems of belief, which is what i think the big problem is. Not to say “oh well gee, the simple solution here is to just HEY lets all just get together, share the same beliefs and work at our problems as a single unit”  that’s not going to happen soon. Not in my lifetime i feel.
&gt;In fact, that might not even be the solution to anything for all i know. Online social media has done both some amazing and terrible things. Hell, i owe my own personal success to online social media… i really do. Im sure there are millions of more success stories to come of social media in the future as well… but, it’s an all encompassing giant, spanning across virtually every topic conceivable, not just “hey check this guy out”.  everything from “sup twitter im taking a shit”  to “Konys a big asshole” to “stop this privacy bill” … we can’t very well distrubute the weight of the entirety of social media on ONE issue or topic… but sometimes we do for some reason, which is the result of a “trend”.. Some trends benefit the personal success of a single entity, some draw attention to causes, and others let me know just how biebers hair is fuckin doin.
&gt;you obviously cant measure the actual “value” or “score” of a trend in terms of its nobility, value, priority, sometimes it seems all you can do is just follow the numbers.
&gt;If i had to interpret trends as “information” my view on the world would probably be, “oh okay, lets see here… Lady gaga is touring, syria is burning, snookis pregnant, lol, were all watching the grammys coz yeah, its the grammys, and oh theres some war criminal in Uganda exploiting children, and yeah, that makes me mad, so ill retweet that to get other people mad”
&gt;yeah, check me out crazy newsroom guy from the film “Network” … YOU HAVE TO GET MAD…. GOD DAMNIT, IM MAD AS HELL, AND IM NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE”
&gt;well YES… i do get a lot upset inside when war is waging in other lands, and im sitting here making music, or planning a tour. Seems the only thing i can do is just read up about a little more about it, maybe spread a little more “awareness”.  But to me “awareness” is a funny thing…
&gt;So there i was standing outside my house as it was burning down. To create awareness, i screamed out loud, i tweeted, i facebooked, “HOLY FUCK, EVERYONE… MY FUCKING HOUSE IS BURNING DOWN” everyone came over… and we were all very upset, we talked about it, we raised more awareness… yeah.. everyone was well aware that my shit was burning down. Then my fucking house burnt down.
&gt;What would have been awesome is if people brought a hose, or a bucket of water, or something that might subdue the flames.
&gt;So obviously, yes, creating awareness to global issues is a wonderful thing… but out of all that awareness, how much action is possible? obviously if it were a matter of simple math, say for every 10 people who knew about something then one person does something, then ergo, the more awareness the better…. but a funny thing happens with social media…. weve got awareness overload… what action can be taken across such different world views?  Im not debunking any particular cause or claim here… but i just feel like the world is so far separated in belief systems and cultures that we need to overcome QUITE a few more global conflicts and culture clash before we can globally solve a problem overnight.
&gt;I dont know, im nothing even close to a philanthropist, politician or nothing even NEAR an activist or even fucking EDUCATED for that matter. This isnt gospel. (thats another fuckin story right there) I just want to encourage more people to think for themselves more often… were all very apt at “spreading awareness” as a nation, a culture, WE HAVE THAT SHIT DOWN.  Let’s focus a little more on what kinds of peaceful resolve and positive action *insert grain of salt here* (according to our western values) can be taken to resolve a global issue. By asking the people claiming to be the “frontmen of the cause”  (which is no doubt, usually a noble cause) who are asking for money or attention, WHERE is this going, HOW is it getting there, WHERE is the data, WHO is doing the footwork, and most importantly what are the predicted results.

I'm kinda disappointed with the folks at iHeartRadio, they probably did the same move to Joel like they did to Green Day. (Shortened their set due to usher doing an extended performance).

But I will say Gerard killed it with singing Griefers, it was weird listening to it without the vocal layering....

Deadmau5 for me is a bit of an odd one out - the only other electronic music I listen to is Jon Hopkins, Sufjan Stevens' electronic stuff, Baths, and a few other small artists. Aside from that I listen to a lot of folk and more chill stuff.

I'm interested because I think Deadmau5 is set apart from the rest. His chord progressions and fine-tuned sounds stun me, and I struggle to envision other artists in his position making tracks like Careless, Telemiscommunications, and other atypical songs.

- **Project 56** (56 songs made specifically for people with a short attention span)  
- **A Little Oblique** (made before Get Scraped)  
- **BSOD**'s album (a group consisting of Joel and others)  
- **Circa 1998-2002** (various tracks, some of which are on later albums)

I reuploaded these to MediaFire because of the recent interest in these works and because I personally had a hard time finding these without going to a shady website with tons of pop-ups.

Enjoy!

Note 1: I'll be getting WTF!'s album later on and maybe other miscellaneous tracks by request.  
Note 2: For those of you who don't know, these are all free to download, so no pirating involved (even though Joel doesn't care if you pirate his music). :)",,False,,t5_2ru8s,1353394455.0,,Snoo,True,t3_13hy81,http://www.reddit.com/r/deadmau5/comments/13hy81/links_to_other_works_by_joel_in_the_sidebar/,

Would any Mau5heads with mixing and editing skills be willing to make a continuous mix of &gt;Album Title Goes Here&amp;lt; with a better track order? I have no particular order but i think the first half should be a more aggressive fast lead up to one of the 3 best tracks on the album; There Might Be Coffee, Fn Pig, and The Veldt. The rest could be the more chilled and slower songs, rapped up by the live version of Strobe.

I want to give it away to a lucky redditor/fan. Long story short I have 4 but the 4th person bailed. 

Rules:

* No new accounts

* You have to be at least 21 years old (not my rule)

* You actually have to go to the show (no selling the ticket)

* have fun &amp;amp; enjoy the show


That's it, If you are 100% able, willing and want to go to the show write it in the comments and Friday 12:00 noon EST I will randomly select the winner. The day of the event I will meet you to give you the ticket &amp;amp; bracelet. I will try to answer any questions but I think the links above will provide all the info you might need.

Edit: I'll be collecting names till tomorrow at 11:15 est. 

Update: we have a winner: muterevised

More info: there was a total of 27 people that signed up for the giveaway. I checked the comments &amp; posts of each user (I didn't really want to give it to a dbag) but each member was cool and respectful in all their comments and posts. This is why I love reddit and try to help out with the community any way I can. If for some reason muterevised can't make it I will pick a new name and let you know ASAP.
