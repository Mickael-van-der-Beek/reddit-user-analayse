As a bit of history, I was in an abusive relationship when I was in my mid-teens where he forced non-sex acts to ""make up"" for me wanting to wait. So, I think it was pretty reasonable that I had never finished a blowjob after that. Every time I tried (which I did!) I would gag really bad, get nauseous, and start to feel like crap about myself for failing. But last night, I was giving some manual/oral pleasure to my man without putting him in my mouth, he got really close, and I decided to go for it. Finished and swallowed with no effort, no gagging, nothing. Just a sense of pride and accomplishment. 

My SO knew about my past and, through lots of profanity at the surprise, told me I could spit if I needed to while laying back with his eyes closed. When I answered ""Spit what?"" he looked up shocked and all I could do was wear a shit-eating grin and giggle. I felt so good about myself.

I'm 22 years old, have never been kissed (sober), and I only recently figured out how to masturbate at all. So imagine my surprise when, now that I'm comfortable with my technique, I experimented with porn and figured out that I'm a complete and utter softie.

I tried the big names in porn. Didn't do anything for me. Kinky stuff, nah. All the videos of nameless guys and loud girls were boring. But I accidentally clicked a ""boring"" video of a college couple, and bam! There it was. Within a minute, orgasm one struck me dumb. I was so dazed that I just kept up. By the time it was done, I'd had five orgasms in twenty minutes. I hadn't even known that was possible!

I realized around the last - and best - orgasm that it was because what I was watching was totally real. They were laughing, took every chance possible to kiss or hold each other tighter, and they just seemed to happy and playful and in love. At one point, when they switched positions, he started playing the bongos on her rear, and I couldn't help but wish I had a relationship like that. They just had so much fun! In the end, he picked up the camera, zoomed in on her face, and just said, ""Hi, Mary!"" and that was it. I think I blacked out a little.

So apparently my kink is loving, happy, fun sex. I don't know why - perhaps it's the endorphins - but it's made me decide to invite the guy I've been crushing on for a year to have drinks with me. If things go really well, maybe someday we can end up like the couple in that video, too.

Each time (including the instances that were in a committed relationship) was met with disgust, stopping all activity, and of course embarrassment on my part. 

So I feared the very same when he started initiating sexy times in bed one morning a few days ago. I recently got an IUD installed and my period has been somewhat unpredictable/mostly spotting, but I was fairly sure I was due for it that day. Everything seemed to be in the clear when he started fingering me so I figured I'd risk it. A few positions in I feel something and tell him ""Oh god. Don't look down."" He's immediately concerned (but still inside) as I grab for a blanket, and then nonchalantly asks if I got my period. I tell him yes and begin apologizing profusely. 

Then he says something that may not be a big deal to all of you but to me, was momentous: ""So? I don't care."" 

He nonetheless sees I'm a little uncomfortable with it so we move to the shower for a while. Then back to bed once we remembered the newtonian limitations of shower sex for us. For some reason doggy style has tended to not be messy at all in the past so, again, with my (admittedly diminishing) discomfort in mind, we start with that, but then proceed with all the usual positions anyway and he finishes like normal. I still tell him not to look down as he pulls out but he gets up to get a towel, cleans himself off with a single swipe, and tosses the towel to me. 

And says again, **""I really, really don't care. It's blood. It's all up inside of me too, you know.""** 

So, again. Maybe this isn't as big a deal to some of you, but this was significant to me for many reasons. I'm always bummed when I have to take a week off sex so the prospect of no longer having to do that is great. Plus, my last relationship was emotionally abusive in some ways and this incident reminded me how quickly I was led to agree that this was something gross that I should be ashamed of and try to prevent. I'd obviously never force period sex on someone who wasn't comfortable with it, but I think had I not spent 2 years in deference to a total fuckwit, I would've initially been as indifferent to it as my current boyfriend is. 

Pretty much everything he does is in stark contrast to my ex. This event was just another reminder that a healthy relationship *is* possible. And all of you ladies deserve that.

All my friends had had them, I knew girls who got one every time after sex, my mom got them, and it wasn't until I got mine that I realized how much they suck. 

To make things worse, I got mine on a Tuesday afternoon. Early Wednesday afternoon, I was to start a pretty long road trip. At first I didn't know what it was, and by the time we needed to leave, there was no way to see my doctor (the appointment would have taken 6 days anyway). 

So here I am in a car with all my friends in horrible pain, constantly feeling like I need to pee while they're singing along to obnoxious pop songs. Every city we stopped in, I looked for an urgent care or somewhere to help me out. I tried every home remedy we could think of, and nothing worked or seemed to make it better in any way. Finally I called my doctor and told her about my situation and because she is awesome she wrote my a prescription for antibiotics to pick up in the next town AND told me the best news of my life: baking soda relieves all symptoms of a UTI by the next time you pee after you consume it.

At first I thought it was strange, but then I followed her directions of 1 teaspoon baking soda to ounces of water and before we could even pick up the antibiotics, I was pain free and that constant desire to pee was gone. 

I'm not sure how common this knowledge is, as none of my friends knew about it, or my mother who is an RN, or any of the other women I've told, but I swear I went from a level 8 discomfort to a level 0. It was so nice, I literally cried.

And I just wanted to share that with you in case you don't know. Keep in mind that baking soda has A LOT of sodium in it, so keep drinking plenty of water (I actually bought a huge bottle of water, put the teaspoon in and chugged), and the relief doesn't last forever, and I've only heard of it actually curing a UTI from one or two women so consider this an early treatment and a good hold over until your doc can get your meds. Also, baking soda taste absolutely nasty, and my doctor told me to also take some Vitamin C to balance out the acid and alkaline levels in my body.

Hope this helps and if any of you try it, it's always fun to get feed back.

I'm here with a rather exciting update!

After lots of talking, months of mutual masturbation (via skype, as we're in a long distance relationship), a bottle of lube, and two hours of very loving foreplay, I managed to overcome my sexual anxiety, and the pain that came with it. We had real, true-blue penis in vagina sex yesterday, and it was incredible. Sometimes I got a little panic-y, but he was very patient and I was able to go from one finger to two to a rather girthy penis with minimal pain or freaking out. 

Afterwards we rolled over, gave each other a very giddy high-five, and spent the rest of the day cuddling and being happy. Maybe this is a cheesey thing to say, but I've never felt so cared for. It's especially astounding when I realize it comes from doing something that used to make me feel so terrible.

Needless to say, tonight was another one of those nights, only this time I woke up in the middle of the dream sexually frustrated. So I tried to take care of myself (it has never solved anything before). This time, though? HOLYMOTHEROFSWEETBICYCLINGJESUS. 


Sorry for all of this, I just needed to share. Thank you for listening and all of the helpful encouragement y'all have posted on here.

We were exhausted and giggly and realized (thanks to you guys) that it is okay to experiment together and learn together and it isn't perfect every time! And that is okay! 

This is a huge deal for me because I am an extreme OCD perfectionist and my husband and I were raised in fundamental Christian families that were completely ignorant of the existence of sex in the world, so it was awesome to be able to turn to this community for first-timer advice. My husband never received a sex talk at all and knew nothing about the female genitalia. We will never do this to our children!! 

Anyways, we had surprisingly awesome sex for being the first time (and still have a lot to learn of course), so thanks again so much 2Xsex!

So throughout my sexual journey with men, I never really know what to do with their penis, unless it is in my mouth or inside of me. Many many times this has happened, where a guy is fondling me and he reaches out and begins guiding my hand to his penis. I just kind of rub it twice and then move my hand away. Honestly, I feel uncoordinated and stupid trying to pump away at it...but I also feel guilty because I want to pleasure my guy, and without being in a committed relationship I do not give oral sex.   

Which brings me to last night. Current guy I'm seeing. He is exploring my ladybits and begins moving my hand towards his penis. I kind of bring it back up and he says something along the lines of, ""why don't you ever touch me, are you afraid of it?"" he is half joking but I know he wants me to do *something* to it.

And I was totally cool with that. But I knew guys want you to come. So I had always faked orgasms. Always. Every time.  I met my now husband.  Same thing, faked it every time, when I realized things were serious I totally regretted faking every time. "" what if I have to do this for the rest of my life"" so I came clean A YEAR AND A HALF IN. 
A Little advise: don't fake it ever. 

As you can guess, he was hurt, angry, betrayed, and I'm sure a lot of other things too. 

We worked through it. A lot which has been fun and challenging and happy and emotional. 

I bought my first vibrator a few months ago and he would get me off with that. 

Then I got more comfortable with receiving oral. And recently started coming from that. Which was exciting enough. 

I think we both were fine with just that. I know I wasn't hopeful for ever having an orgasm from penetration. 

So tonight, we started out with me receiving, I came. Then him receiving. Then sex. It was looking like our typical beginning of awesome sex. He was ready to finish earlier than I wanted and when he asked to I said no and got on top since he doesn't come that way. 

So here it is...

He tells me to get comfortable do what feels good and not to worry. 
For the first time I did, and I flexed my thighs. And was getting really into it. I could feel myself wanting more. 
He said "" lean back"" gently nudged. I did and just kept riding. He started touching me and rubbing my clit. I could feel it happening. I was going to come. 
Normally here I would feel too pressured or back off out of frustration but I didn't  
I just let it build and build and wash over me. 

Tl;dr there's hope for intercourse orgasms. I never thought I would be able to. It was the most amazing spiritually connecting experience I have ever had. Tonight I feel more in love than at our wedding.

I sent him a text, knowing he'd still be up, saying how I couldn't wait to see him on Thursday (we live about an hour away at our parents' houses) with something along the lines of missing him inside me. I get no reply. Fast forward to this afternoon and I ask him over IM if he plans on ignoring every remotely flirty text I send him (this is not the first time, he even ignores less explicit ones). He initially said he didn't want to text me back as I couldn't sleep and he didn't want to keep me up longer. I said it upset me when he doesn't even acknowledge it. It ends up, he thinks me sending him texts like that are ""cringy, corny and weird"" (his words, repeated more than once) and that they make him uncomfortable.  

I feel completely mortified, and so hurt and just like I'm a massive weirdo pervy creep. I thought it was a fun thing to do whilst we're apart, but he's been thinking this about me every time?? (We've been going out for about 9 months, always long distance) I now feel like I'm too ashamed to show any sort of sexual interest in him in case I embarrass myself again. It really hurts that he doesn't want to be flirty with me. I don't think he wants out of the relationship as he's stated before he wouldn't put up with the effort if he didn't love me, and he got quite annoyed when I asked if he was even still attracted to me. I don't know, I just can't stop thinking about this and it's really upsetting, feeling so...unwanted and rejected I guess. I suppose I just want someone to vent to and a little support/comforting. Sorry it's so long!  

TL;DR Sent boyfriend dirty text, told flirting via text is ""corny as shit and pretty cringy"" (direct C+P from IM conversation). Feel like a huge loser :(  

EDIT: Thanks for all the nice, supportive messages everyone, they really helped me feel less rubbish. He and I discussed it, and it was just him not really knowing how he's supposed to respond to something like that and that words don't really turn him on (unless I say them right in front of him). Like he said ""they're just words, what am I meant to do with them?"". He's much, much more visual than I am (me sending him naked pics is still A-ok with him, although I class them together with sexy texts) and whilst words can turn me on, they do nothing for him.

I stayed on my back so that I could see his face the whole time which ended up being worth it because we were both in disbelief the entire time. I asked him to take off the condom so he could finish inside in my ass. One of his goals when it came to sex was not only to be able to have anal with a girl but to come in her ass.

(It's super long, so apologies, haha.)


My boyfriend and I have a pretty wonderful sex life. Soon after we started dating we found out that our libidos are pretty much perfect matches, we have a lot of the same tastes, and we even started incorporating his foot fetish without any hitches at all! (Turns out I like getting my feet worshipped, haha.) I've always been into being submissive, but I've never ""fully"" experienced it with any of my sexual relationships.


So, I told my boyfriend about it, and with him being the naturally sweet and adorable guy he is told me he'd have to ease into it and he's not used to being dominant in that way. No big deal, I understand that it can be a big undertaking to take on a role like that.


We always have pretty amazing sex, but fast forward to yesterday - HOLY SHIT. We had been sexting each other all day long (and even sent some sexy pics and video to each other the night before), so by the time he came to pick me up to hang out, my panties were basically soaked. We got back to his house and had dinner (we were hungry and couldn't wait, haha), and after it was seriously one amazing sexual experience after the other.


We recently discovered that I go absolutely nuts when he plays with that really sensitive spot on my clit (the little bead-type thing under the hood), and he teased me for what felt like AGES before we finally had sex. It was like awesomely amazing sex sessions again and again. And here's the kicker: The second time around, he flipped me over onto my stomach, covered my mouth, and whispered in my ear something to the effect of ""You're gonna have to be quiet."" in seriously the sexiest voice of my life. (I don't remember the exact wording, I was basically in ecstasy at that point.) He went for it hard, deep, and fast, and he ended up pressing my face into the pillow to keep me quiet. I could feel him pressing his chest against my back and breathing into my ear ""You like that?"" 


I had one of the best orgasms I've EVER had in my life. Afterwards I ended up just holding him, giggling a little bit because it was so amazing and I was so happy/ amazed he went out of his way to satisfy a sexual desire of mine. The two of us couldn't stop smiling and giggling a little bit. We ended up making love after that and it was so incredibly emotional, lots of prolonged eye contact and ""I love you""s, and we even ended up cumming together.

In 2002 (17) I lose my Virginity. No real problems. We use condoms for 6 months before I decide to use the pull and pray method. Stupid decision on its own, let alone it later gets paired with the fact that he cheated on me with 12 *TWELVE!* different women during our 2.5 and was exposed to HIV when he was 14 (I met him when he was 28). I was not a smart girl, but thankfully the universe looked out for me and I am clean of all diseases.

In 2006, my fiance (25m) and I (21f) are getting ready to have sex and upon insertion, it felt like my vagina was set on fire with the fire of 1,000 suns. Went to the clinic to get checked out and was treated for an allergic reaction. Apparently, I'm allergic to the lubrication on regular condoms. We have to switch to condoms with Spermicide,  and have no problems. I go on to tell medical professionals from this point forward that I am allergic to latex just to be safe. Lots of swelling and itchiness and blech.

2008 (23) I get the Mirena implanted and became good friends with Monistat. These are off and on for about 6 months, then I haven't had any problems since.

I should mention in here FH and I have opposite libidos and I cannot climax with a partner. Not from oral, anal, or vaginal penetration. Nothing. It was a huge blow to his ego, and it took us a long time (years) to work through it. Now we're back on a giant upswing.

2013 (27):

I generally shave using conditioner. I was hurried and grabbed the wrong bottle and shaved with shampoo. My legs were okay but when I shave Lady Vi, I was awoken at 2:30am with my cooter on fire. A cold bath and hydrocortizone cream later she calmed down.

We are enjoying ourselves and he asks to take a break for a moment, then we decide he'll just play with me and help me get myself off. I ask him to bring out the pink dildo I am not a huge fan of but would like to cum while feeling ""full"". Again my vagina is set on fire. I ran to the bathroom and took a warm baking soda bath and just sat in the tub crying. He sat on the toilet looking all pitiful. I apologized for having a vagina that hates me. He laughed at me and told me she was just being a catty bitch is all...gave me a kiss, told me he loved me and brought me a bottled water.

All I want is a vagina that works WITH me, not AGAINST me. *Sigh*

I've noted that many, like the majority of all the guys I know, are quite sexist. Some of them are openly sexist while others show their sexist side when you've got to know them better. 

Those sexist fellas likes to talk about women they've been with. Some are quite childish, just blabbin' on about what huge tits some chick had or how her dirty talk was. But many of them talk a lot about how slutty and cheap some girl they've been with apparently is according to them. And what gets me uncomfortable with this is how they won't acknowledge anything else about the girl. Just how she was in bed, how she looks and how easy/slutty/cheap she was. Doesn't matter if it's an ONS or some FWB-situation. It seems like as long as the guy isn't in *love* with the girl, he's degrading her completely to a piece of meat when he's talking of her with others. 

This makes me really uneasy. I'm often out partying with friends, but I always refuse to bring someone home and barely flirt with guys anymore, because the thought of being the girl that boys only will acknowledge as a sexual object is really unsettling to me. Same goes for acquaintances and guys I sort-of-already-know. I mean, when me and my girl friends does some kiss and tell, we naturally speak of the guy as an actual person. We don't just rate him and then joke around about his performance or how desperate he was. But seeing as how 90% of all the guys I know seems to talk about that, and only that, I'm feeling it's really hard to trust men. 

Whenever I feel attracted to some guy, and feel that ""hey, I would totally want to go home with him tonight!"" the feeling automatically switches into ""or maybe not"" as I get reminded on how all my fellow-boy friends are so degrading in how they speak of women. 

Is there anyone who feels the same way? I'd like to hear some thoughts about this that might change my view on things. All of this is kind of planting insecurities in my mind, and I could live without that. 

Note that all my guy-friends aren't of the same ""type"". Some are nerds, some are party animals. Some have full time jobs, others are studying or just playing WoW all day. Ages range from 18-25. They come from different backgrounds and vary a lot in how they are in general, but the whole degrading sex talk seems consistent in almost all of them.

We're both in our early 20s, we've been together for about three years, and I've never really enjoyed kissing him. Problem is, I don't know if I'm any better. He was my first kiss, and he'd only kissed one person before me, so we're both inexperienced as hell. 

Early in the relationship, we were constantly fooling around in my dorm room when my roommate was with her own boyfriend, and things were great. It was easy for me to get turned on when things weren't necessarily going past 2nd base, and once they went further, I started losing interest. I eventually started faking orgasms, which I finally confessed to him and he said he didn't want that. He suggested buying a vibrator, and we did, and things turned way around. I never faked it again. 

Then he graduated and went to grad school in another state. Almost as soon as that happened, I started to find it difficult to get aroused when we were together. I started to try and *plan* sex out, figuring out when we could make it happen, but I always fall short. He would fall asleep because I don't know how to initiate, or whatever. Then, I would get more and more anxious because it wasn't happening, and I'd put more pressure on myself, and it just got worse and worse. I'd be sitting there trying to get turned on because I felt like I *should,* and I know that's not a good way to manage it.

Now, I find myself dreading it. Not just because I don't ever know how to initiate, but because he's just not a good kisser, and never has been. I've talked to him about it repeatedly during our relationship, but things only ever got marginally better, and then he falls back into bad habits. Things aren't a total slobberfest anymore, but it's still not any good. Let me describe.

He places his lips on mine, above mine, then swaps them so that my lips are above his. Back and forth and back and forth, mouths closed. I'd try to change it up, but if I even part my lips, his tongue is IN MY MOUTH ALL THE WAY AND THERE IT STAYS. It's awful. I find myself dreading his sexual advances, because it inevitably involves kissing, and the kissing is just a nightmare.

I don't know how to teach him what I want, because I don't really know what I want. And I don't know how to talk to him about it or turn anything around because I feel like I've done it before and it hasn't helped. 

He's an incredibly thoughtful guy in a lot of ways, but in a lot of ways, he's dumb as hell. He's the smartest person I know, hands down, but his communication skills are borderline nonexistent, at least regarding personal things. 

**TL;DR because I know this needs it: How do I A) figure out how I like to be kissed? and B) teach this to my BF? and C) get over my anxiety about getting in the mood?**

It's been quite idyllic. We traveled to India, Thailand, Morocco. He composed songs for me and I choreographed dances to them. We respect and listen to each other. He's everything I've been looking for. I actually made a list of the man I wanted to be with and he came along and matched the requirements.

The problem is this: We started having fantastic sex for about 2 years. He's the only man who was able to make me have an orgasm just from penetration. But I've been gradually losing my sex drive to the point that it now pretty much grosses me out. Not just with him, but any kind of sexual contact turns me off.

He's been saying for months that if he doesn't have more sex (we've been having sex about once a week) he just can't stay with me. He's very attractive and I love his penis. I sometimes fantasize during the day about seeing him at night and having sex, but when the time comes I just want to cuddle with him and watch TV or sleep or eat or talk.

Last night again he tried to initiate sex. I tried to go along with it but I was not feeling anything good and almost got into it but just couldn't. The worst part is  that I am a sort of saliva-phobe and my body is dry for some reason. So he uses saliva and that completely turns me off. I've mentioned this to him but he hates Astroglide or KY. So last night, we tried until he went flaccid and said, ""I just feel like we're not attracted to each other."" We fell asleep (well, I did) without holding each other like we usually do.

It's heartbreaking, really. I guess the perfect relationship is a myth, at least for me. Today before he left, he said he was sad. I said me too. I said can we meet tonight? I want to make love. But he is not believing it anymore, he just looked at me sadly and said, ""I thought about this last night; I couldn't sleep. We need to talk but this is not the moment, I have to go to work.""

Is there a way to make yourself interested in sex again? I should point out that I have been going through depression. First my mom got sick, then my dad died, then my mom died. That made things much much worse. My mom was disgusted by sex pretty much, so that might have something to do with my issues. 

Anyway, just a sad rant. If anyone has tips on how to trick myself into wanting sex, please let me know.

EDIT: Thank you all for your suggestions. He just left me a breakup letter downstairs. I guess I don't have to worry about fixing the situation anymore.

Him: 31/m

We're in a healthy, monogamous relationship for 2.5 years. We live together and don't have or want any kids. Objectively, I know our sex life is good. Early on, sex was happening 5-6 times a week. For the last six months or so, it's been around 3-4 times a week. Last week, it was twice. I'm kind of meticulous about keeping track in my period calendar.


I've noticed a pattern in my mood over the last few months. If we don't have sex for 2 or more consecutive days, there's a rise in my anxiety. We are pretty 50/50 about initiating sex and basically never turn each other down. So if I initiated the last time or two, I feel like I should back off and let him initiate. So if he doesn't for 2+ days, I start wondering and worrying about dumb, irrational stuff. Does he even want to be around me? Should I even try to touch him? etc. 


As soon as we have sex again, I feel fine. I'm validated, content and fulfilled. I'm confident in myself and the relationship. And the cycle continues. 


Sunday night, I was anticipating sex because we hadn't done anything since Thursday. I started my period that day but that hasn't stopped us before. He informs me he'll be out of commission for a few days due to some irritation (he's a cyclist, it tends to happen). I'm not thrilled, but I understand and take this information just fine in that moment.


Then, it stews around in my head for a couple hours to the point where my brain is basically a huge neon sign that says **""HAHA HE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU FOR A WEEK""**. I KNOW it's so ridiculous but I couldn't hide being upset this time. Broke down crying, tried my best to tell him how I was feeling without blaming him. Not just right then, but about my two-day sex/anxiety cycle too. He was patient, comforting, and reassuring, as I knew he'd be. I tried to make very clear that I didn't want HIM feeling bad or responsible. It's all in my silly, anxious, dumb head. 


He said he'd be happy to have sex more often, not just for me but for himself. Which I appreciate, but I don't think it really addresses the issue. **WHY** does a dip in sexual activity bother me so much and how can I stop it? 


I'm terrified of being in a sexless or low-sex relationship. It's seriously one of my worst fears. If he were to *actually* reject me for a more abstract reason (not in the mood or whatever), I think it would break my heart. Once or twice a week is just barely enough to keep me satiated (and emotionally stable, evidently). Once or twice a month sounds absolutely depressing. I see posts from long-term and married couples mentioning once-a-month sex casually and I wonder how they can stand it. Children, LDRs, and health issues aside, it makes no sense to me why a healthy relationship would go through that. It would just be a glaring sign to me that something is very, very wrong.

I ***know*** there are far worse things that can happen in a relationship. I'm in this lovely cycle of feeling ridiculous for feeling upset with something so ridiculous. I know sex is a lot more dynamic than just meeting a quota per week. I know all this, rationally. How can I make my feelings know this? And attach my self-esteem to something more important, like my personality?

1353960450.0,44,self.TwoXSex,13tuom,My boyfriend is afraid of my sexuality.,scarysexythrowaway,48,4,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/13tuom/my_boyfriend_is_afraid_of_my_sexuality/,"Hello ladies. I'm pretty frustrated about this; I've never experienced this before. Here goes.

Background Info:

Me: I like sex. Once a day, usually. I have had 20+ partners (including a few women). I've posed nude, I've worked as a stripper, I've had numerous boyfriends, I've contracted HSV-2 (don't judge, I tell all sex partners). I will tell a man what I want and need, which is primarily oral sex to get me off. I've been masturbating since age 4 so the clit is it; internal penetration feels nice but does not produce orgasm. Every man I sleep with who knows of my situation has had no problem giving me oral first before penetrative intercourse (I have a history of denying my own pleasure and not asking for oral, so now I make sure men know). I enjoy giving oral as well and being adventurous, trying out new things.

SO: From the southern US, somewhat ""conservative"" mentality. I am his fourth sexual partner. He is a monogamist. Before me he hadn't had sex in a year and a half. His last relationship lasted four years and ended when  she cheated. He knows everything about my past and has graciously accepted me.

He and I have been dating for two months, and we almost never have sex. If I initiate something, it ends up with him getting off and telling me he'll eat me out ""later"" (which never happens) or saying I smell or taste bad. No one has EVER said I taste bad! I even got vaginal spray for him, but still. I've talked about it with him numerous times and he calls me a sex addict for wanting to sleep with him. Somehow he doesn't seem to understand that sex is a mutual experience, which means I get off too. I've cried to him more than a few times about this, and he'll go down on me that day, but the next day things will go back to the way they were before. He said he thinks about me in a sexual way every day but I guess doesn't feel like acting on it. 

I'm pretty sure SO's go-to method of initiating sex with me is we will be lying in bed and he'll put my hand on his erection. I've started ignoring that when he does it. One of his favorite tricks, as stated above, is asking me to give him a blow job now and he'll eat me out later. I've stopped falling for that one. His idea of foreplay is...nonexistent. The first two weeks (notably, before he knew of my condition) were not like this! The other night, we hadn't had sex in a week due to my period (other dudes have had no issue laying a towel down or giving oral with a tampon in). I was settling in to go to sleep when he casually stated that he was going to masturbate. Huh? He asked if I just wanted him to ""pound it out"", I was so desperate for intimacy I agreed. When he came over to me he immediately tried penetrating me without even getting me wet first. But why bother putting in the work to coax out my natural lubrication when we can just use astroglide? It felt great and when it was over I couldn't help but start to cry--he had NO intention of finishing me off too. It's like my pleasure is not important to him at all. And then, due to the shitty lubrication, the next day I experienced the start of a painful weeklong outbreak. 

For him to go down on me I usually have to start on him and then turn it into a 69. And on top of it all, I've started experiencing this weird phenomenon when he goes down on me where the orgasm will be right there and then I will lose it. When we first started dating he said he loved oral. 

I have two main theories: 1. my brazen liberal sexuality scares him; and 2. my HSV-2 scares him. He's admitted to the second theory but not the first (yet he has no problem never using a condom). We sleepover every day, but I've started going to sleep earlier and he'll join me several hours later.

Today I got off from a 24 hour shift at work. I masturbated when I got home. SO came to see me later, asked if I masturbated. I don't lie to him. ""Aw man!"" He responded. ""I was going to go down on you but you already came. Guess I'm going to go rub one out and look at porn now."" 

I'm going to see my parents next month. I'll be gone for three weeks. He told me not to masturbate that whole time. 

His perspective whenever I bring sex up is that he doesn't want to be like all the other guys I dated who ONLY wanted to sleep with me. Also, the thing where I lose orgasm is causing him to doubt himself and feel bad. But I've told him that the solution is not LESS oral sex. Plus not all my sexual partners have used me for my body, just some.

Has anyone experienced something like this? What do I do?

My husband and I are having some bedroom difficulties. A little background, if I may. I've been diagnosed with endometriosis, which can, on occasion, make sex painful. But with the right amount of foreplay, the pain is almost imperceptible (but never quite gone.) I take 18 mgs of Concerta (ADHD Stimulant) at 4:30 am on school days (only). I have had Implanon since November 2010, and my husband and I smoke just about every day now (but not until my homework is done) since it helps me sleep after the Concerta.

So, taking all of that into consideration... I just don't get turned on any more. It doesn't matter what nice things he does for me or how sweet and gentle he may be in trying to convince me. No sexting in the world will make it happen, and being downright blunt about it just won't work. I don't even want to masturbate anymore! We still do it on occasion (I'm thinking once, twice a week, tops), but nowhere near the frequency that we used to have, and I miss it! I've always thought a bit like a guy, and linked the health of our relationship to the frequency/quality of our sex (along with other things, of course.) But this is a totally new territory for me. I tried talking to him about coming on to me more gently, trying to hug and love me more and be more emotionally attentive so that I could get turned on. 

It's been going on like this for months! I just don't know what to do any more :(

 Do you have certain variations to normal sex positions that make it feel better? One example of this would be putting a pillow under your bum during missionary which elevates you a bit and feels better for both parties. I believe it's called the butterfly, or something like that.

I write mu first post here, because I really don't know where else I should go. This includes the fact that I don't even know what subreddit to put it in, if there us a better one, please post that. This might be a longer story, but I think it's required to get how I feel.

Three weeks ago, on a Saturday morning, i was raped on my way home from my job as a bartender.  I peripherally know the guy, we have a frind in common. He had been making some passes at me during my worknight, but I just dismissed that as I always do, drunk guys iften hit on everything with a pulse within a 600 m radius. The rape in itself was horrible, but it wasn't anything close to the clusterfuck of feelings that came around in my head afterwards. 
I knew that I should have called the police afterwards, but I simply could't. The thought of anyone else touching me *there* for evidence,the thought of male police officers questioning whether I made it up, or whether it was really rape, the thought that my muslim family would know (my parents aren't very religious, but other parts of my family are), the potential court case, everying just overwhelmed me and I did the only thing I could think of was running home, throw all my clothes away and get into the shower to scrub myself as clean as possible for more than an hour while crying like mad. At that time I couldn't stand being alone anymore, so I called my oldest friend, let's call him Robert, over to talk. Loyally, he got up at 5:30am a Saturday morning, to come comfort me. We have known eachother since we were 4, so we never have of eachother in a romantic way, and we have more of a habit of setting eachother up if we can. When he heard what had happend, he immediately wanted me to go to the police, he promised me that he would stay with me all the way, and almost tried to physically drag me out of the apartment, but when i stated crying hysterically he saw that I needed only two things: comfort and a sense of security. So he stayed at my apartment for the next four days, he even took a few days off for me. We laughed together, he held me when I cried, we watched bad movies together, he cooked the most amazing dinner for me, he loyally slept on my crappy sofa, so I wouldn't be alone in the apartment at night, we talked everything over, second by second several times,as he said that while uncomfortable, it's best that I get it all out. In short, he did everything to comfort me when I needed it, and everything he could to make me forget it once in a while. He then got a doctor he knew to write me a note, saying that I needed a few weeks off work, which was also nice.

Then after a few weeks, I felt a lot better, and returned to work. I knew I would always remember it, but I could go through the day without thinking off it. It felt as if I had just been in an unfortunate carcrash, and I was just becomming better. Everything went good. 

Until I last night saw the guy again at work. I was almost ready to both scream and puke at the same time, until I saw it in his eyes: nothing but pure fear. He froze for a second, and then he limped away as fast he could. Limped, why did he do that? I asked our friend we had in common what had happend to him. He answered:"" some psycopath with a baseballbat beat his crotch to a pulp. Weirdly enough he doesn't want the police involved, he kept saying to the nurses that he had just crashed on his motorbike""

It didn't take me many seconds to realize what had happened, it was even easier to realize it, when I realized that Robert's baseballbat had gone missing about two weeks ago (he never told me that, but it was missing from its usual corner next to the main door in his apartment last time I was there). Robert had beaten this guy up in his own way of justice. I wasn't surprised that he could do it, he has served two tours in Afghanistan, but I was shocked that he did it. He has never been violent around me, or generally anyone here back home. He always says that the law is the most important thing to uphold, but this made him put his high principles on the backburner.  

So now I guess that it comes to all of the questions I have:
What should I feel? 
I am in a way very happy that this guy who raped me has gotten a sort of punishment. But it also feels wrong to be happy about vigilantism. 

And I am scared for Robert, this could actually send him to jail, certainly making him lose his job as an officer in the army.

I feel scared that the asshole would want at some point in the future to hurt me again, directly or indirectly. 

I am scared of my family finding all of this out, I love hem to bits, but this really isn't a conversation I'd like to have with them.

I feel weirdly safe by having a friend that would probably take a bullet for me without hesistation. 

I feel guilty that my situation has made it so that Robert felt that it was necessary for him to put himself in his situation. Then again Robert has said this to me many times over the last three weeks ""You're only responsible for your own actions"". I thought that was meant to prevent me from perhaps feeling I was responsible for the rape, but in light of what I know now, he might have meant something else. Then again, if only I had pulled myself together to go to the police just after, he wouldn't have done anything.

I am weirdly and utterly angry at my best friend though more than 20 years, for not only talking to me about this, but also risking his job and jailtime. Not only that, his fiancee is pregnant, and they need him. I am angry that someone so smart could do something so utterly egoistic and stupid. His fiancee knows everything of what has happened, except I guess one slight thing....

And perhaps worst of all, I feel something that I feel that no rapevictim should feel: I have begun to feel a little sorry for the guy who raped me.
 
I also know that I should probably talk to a psychiatrist about this, but how far is such a person allowes to stay silent? This is a case that after all involves two very criminal acts. And as things stand now, I can't prove the rape, but my agressor could certainly prove the assault on him.

What else should I do? 

Thanks in advance.

PS: I'm not worried about pregnancies or STDs, I'm on the pill and I got checked last week for everything.

1362432221.0,37,self.TwoXSex,19ntw7,RANT: i'm that bitch who doesn't like small dicks and it's making me miserable-- please advise/comfort/commiserate. thank you.,sadsizequeen,50,13,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/19ntw7/rant_im_that_bitch_who_doesnt_like_small_dicks/,"Let me start by reiterating the fact that I feel terrible about this-- so please go easy on me.

I am a late 20s lady and I am very confident when it comes to sex and dating. I know what I want in a guy and if I see it I go for it. The only thing that seems to really shake my confidence and continually keep me from finding a new LTR (something I've been looking for for about four years now)... is that even when everything else is awesome, when we get to sexing, if his penis is on the small side, I get nothing out of it.

Of course I've tried! I've slept with a lot of guys with small penises-- and not just one night stands, I've done months-long relationships with small guys. And I've tried different positions-- 69, doggy, me on top, him on top, various leg angles-- whatever. I've also tried just having them use my vibe on me or have them watch or just hold me while I vibe myself or oral, fingering, like really... I feel like I have truly done everything I could think of to stay satisfied with a small guy.

But unfortunately, my experience so far-- and I feel like I may have a bit more experience than most by now-- is that I just can't get a full orgasm from anything besides an average or above guy. So when I'm trying to date a guy, if he's small, ultimately it doesn't matter how awesome he is in every other way-- eventually, and by eventually I mean pretty quickly, any attraction will wane because I do love my orgasms and I honestly get kind of resentful when I'm in a relationship with a dude who can't give them to me-- more so if I'm expected to give him his.

I know its kind of a first world problem but it has absolutely killed two promising relationships I've had in the past two years to be dating a guy where, we'll start messing around, and I get hot, and he gets hot, and eventually I get him off-- maybe even multiple times-- and I get nothing. It is both physically and emotionally frustrating.

And, although I did try, once, openly discussing his lack of size to a guy I was seeing, and although yes, he was incredibly, impressively, cool about it-- ultimately I found there was nothing that could be said or done to make it better-- I mean, it's not like he can just make it bigger.

I am very open to the idea of swinging but I would really like to have one main, long-term partner with whom I might attend swinging clubs or whatever-- but as a complement to a functional relationship-- not as a necessity to keep the relationship functional. So dating a small guy but having an open relationship is not what I want.

To complicate this all even further-- it makes me feel SO GUILTY. SO. SO. SO. SO. G U I L T Y. I'm a girl who had serious body image problems earlier in life and even today, confident though I may be, I am able to be confident in dating because I know my strengths and weaknesses and I am able to be honest about them. I know what things about myself I could happily change to please another person and what things are definitely me and are, as Dan Savage would say, ""the price of admission"" to dating me. ...so I feel like a real cunt for dumping guys just because they have small dicks. More so because I have never found myself able to actually tell one of these guys The Truth about why I'm dumping them. Because honestly? If a guy chooses not to date me for something about me that I can't change-- honestly I am okay with it. Like if a guy honestly felt that my ass was too big (I have a naturally large booty-- it is possible to make it go away, but I don't mind it and the amount of work it takes to get rid of it-- I know because I've done it before-- is not worth it to me) --I could laugh it off. I could get over it.

But of course, no dude who doesn't like some ass would ever date me because of course, he'll see it-- on that first date if not before-- and at that point will be able to either 'fess up or politely decline a second date-- either of which is totally fine-- but guess what??? You can't see penis without taking a guy's pants off first. So yes, many times I have had to conceal a look of deep disappointment and then follow it up with a blow job or some *really* awkward and unsatisfying sex and then try to tap dance my way out of there ala Amy Schumer.  ...which is not to suggest that I wish guys would wear color coded plastic bracelets (like the karate belt version of livestrong bracelets) to help me sort it out. I'm just sayin' please for the love of spaghetti-- does anyone have a decent strategy for this? (I know, no  one does. Sux.)

**TL;DR I can't date guys with small dicks. I'm pretty sure its not my fault but it makes me feel terrible anyway and leads to lots of awkward situations.**

This is a throwaway account because friends (and ex-partners) know what my usual account is. Anyway, here goes.

I'm nineteen years old, almost twenty. I've never been able to orgasm from anything, whatsoever, that I have done. My hands? Nope. Humping a pillow? Nope. Vibrator? Nope. Sometimes the latter two feel nice for a tiny bit, but I've felt nicer sensations just from being scratched on the head, and it quickly turns boring or painful. 

When I look at my vulva in a mirror, there does not appear to be any opening or clitoral hood visible, and I can't detect where one might be with my finger even if I'm completely aroused (and I have quite a vivid imagination, so there's no mental block there.) I know I have a clitoris; probably the most pleasurable sensation I've been able to get has been when I sit on my bike a certain way. But if I touch myself skin to skin -- nothing doing, any sort of aroused I might have been is just gone. I feel really defective, like the machine gun Eve Ensler promised me was between my legs somehow got switched with a broken water pistol, and I've pushed away all my potential sexual partners (four) because I'm so convinced that it'll be awful. 

All these symptoms are consistent with clitoral or labial adhesions, but I'm no doctor. I'm going to see the gyno tomorrow, but I don't know if she'll be able to do anything. I've heard of people being prescribed estrogen creams in other corners of the Internet, but I've also heard that people had to go to as many as eight gynos before they could get any sort of help.

This is super embarrassing, but I don't know what to do. I had a night of hot and heavy sex last night with my new man. BUT when we were done... the condom was no where to be found. Now, I assumed he just took it off or it fell off. The problem is that it's not turning up anywhere and I've torn my room apart looking for it. 

SO.. my fear is that it's stuck inside me. But I can't feel anything! I've dug around a little this morning, but haven't felt anything out of the ordinary.

My question is then, how obvious is it? Can you feel a condom inside you or can it just be there and not bother you until infection or TSS kicks in? Any tips, advice? 

P.S. I'm on a birth control pill that I've been taking for years now, so pregnancy is not my main concern here.


****UPDATE****: It has been found! As I thought, deep inside me. That was... an experience.

1) Relax with a hot shower

2) I found squatting helped

I'm in my late 30s. My friends say I'm funny, attractive, a little weird (but who isn't)… I'm coming to the conclusion that I'm just broken though. I'm the one who is usually single. I have had 3 ltr's, all average around a year at most. Most of the people I've had sex with have been one night stands of flings (not that my number is high considering my age). My last relationship ended in 07, and I've tried on and off to date, I've tried dating sites and I have an active social life and I meet people all the time at public fictions and parties (not bars, I do go to bars but I'm not there to meet people). In this last stretch of singleness I decided to be completely celibate for a time, &amp; not deal with hookup drama. After a few years I decided to try dating again but nobody appealed to me. I have a lot going on with work and I decided I just don't have the energy of attention to give to someone else. So, I decided just to be open to whatever came along.

Only I am finding myself not interested in most of it. When I am interested what happens typically is there's fooling around, which generally involves a BJ, because I like to give them and I'm good at it. However I keep finding that I don't get what I want out of the situation. Sex usually is bland, if I get laid at all. Sometimes the guy gets off and that's it... Trying to create a steady FWB has resulted in failure. I end up feeling used in the end, but I figure I only have myself to blame. 

So I guess I should just give up. I've gotten laid 3 times in the past 4 years, and not much else. I do get offers, but because of past lackluster experiences I don't even want to try anymore.  Sometimes I get stupid and think things will get interesting with a guy, and I keep getting it wrong.  I'm doing something wrong, and I don't know what so I don't know how to fix it. 

So, no more being nice because I'm hitting it off with someone, no more blowjobs. I'm becoming what I feared? A bitter 40something.

I'm not sure if this is abnormal, but I can usually come pretty quickly and frequently during masturbation. I actually just had a sesh and it lasted maybe an hour with climaxes every 10-15 min or so. Each time, a gush flows forth like a dam let loose.

So, to explain the situation a little, I am a queer girl (22) who is recently out of a long-term straight relationship.  I have only been with men in my life, and I finally came to the realization that I am queer while in my previous relationship.  I am in Europe for the summer, and we broke up shortly before I left.  I don't want a serious relationship right now or anything, but I do want to continue exploring my sexuality, in particular this newly found part of it, though most likely that will happen when I return home.

But the problem is that I feel like I'm experiencing my first sexual encounter all over again, since I have no clue what I'm doing with a woman.  I don't know really what to expect, and I also know nothing about toys and the like, so that's somewhat intimidating as well.

",ToeJamSandwich,42,10,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/160gtw/any_advice_on_regaining_sexuality_after_abuse/,"Yesterday, after six months of dealing with long distance, I had sex with my boyfriend. We're both 18 and he (was) a virgin and I was not. After waiting so long, I was really, really looking forward to this. This has been my first real reltionship and first time being with anyone sexually after getting out of a year and a half long abusive relationship. My last sexual encounter with him was... bad. I did say yes, but at that point I felt like my body was something I was obliged to give him access to. I knew that if I gave the honest no it would start a huge fight. That was the first and only time sex has ever hurt for me. I got really tight and dry and it just didn't work.

Anyways, yesterday I tried for the first time in years with a new partner. At first things were going really well. Both of us were so eager to please the other, even though our limited experience meant we didn't really have any idea what we were doing. At some point, though, my mentality kind of switched. Even though I was enjoying it, in the back of my mind all these old feelings were coming back. My body as an obligation. I need to preform well. This is not about my pleasure.

By the time we tried to have sex... I was too tight and too dry. We tried using lube, but we could still barely get it in. I tried to push through and fight through the pain, even though he told me I could stop. Eventually, it was just too much and he pulled out. (Well, more of fell out. There wasn't really much in.) He was really sweet and was holding me and telling me it didn't matter, he still loved me. 

Aaaaand... then I really fucked up and started to cry. It was just so overwhelming. It was supposed to be different with him. All these emotions have nothing to do with him and yet they're coming up. All I could think about was how I'd failed one of my only chances to be with him for a really long time. I wanted to send him back to school with a really happy memory, and instead I was unable to preform and now, to top it all off, crying and snotting all over his bare shoulder. 

It was just... the most sloppy thing I've ever done in my life. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed. I hate to think that for the rest of his life this is going to be the memory he has of his first time.

I'm (24F) and was dating a (30M) for a while. We'll call him ""Ted"". Ted wasn't the best boyfriend. He lied, cheated and we fought a lot. When we fought he'd call me names and I'd break down in tears. I knew he was cheating on me and when I found out I didn't tell him, I just let it happen. Our sex life was active but he was only mediocre in bed. He was rough, he'd scratch me, bruise me and pound away. He didn't have a lot of experience before me.

I'm not much to look at. I wear glasses, my breasts are lopsided and I've got a belly, big thighs and cellulite. Even so, I could do better than him. I'd instigate a lot of fights and a couple of times he'd get physical and hit me in the face. One time he blacked my eye so it was swollen shut and my jaw clicked. I know a lot of you will get up in arms about this but I hoped that would happen. I goaded him into it. I feel an incredible rush when being demeaned, criticized, hit and treated badly. If I didn't there is no way I'd have been with him. I know even I can do better and when people see me with him I feel that pang of shame that I enjoy. When he calls me names, hits me or forces me it's like a buzz that gets into my head. I get instantly aroused. He's raped me (truly against my will, I tried to fight him off) and in a way I found it thrilling.

I left him though, and I'm dating. My problem is I worry how far this will go. I have so many fantasies I know could put me in danger. I've acted some of them out with Ted and I'm lucky they didn't go badly but I think constantly of being kidnapped, attacked, gangraped, I could never admit this to anyone. My friends would have me committed. After the breakup I put up an ad as an escort and I have a number of clients I see regularly. None are men I would see if they weren't paying me and I don't enjoy it sexually but physiologically...I get flushed with arousal. They do things I would never allow otherwise and I'm always worried I'll bump into me on the streets. 

I told a man I met online I was 16 and we met up for sex. He was 35. That was the best sex of my life. I've met men that were married (I found out after) and I stopped seeing them. That's the only thing I won't do.

My ego is okay, not spectacular, but a lot of these men I'm really scratching the bottom of the barrel. Sometimes it feels like I'm getting more and more insecure the more I do it.

First, I want to say a resounding **thank you** to the people who commented. Your feedback was the first step I needed to reorient myself. 

At first I tried my typical ""superwoman"" tactic of ignoring the problem, by attending a town meeting and going to work. Before work I told my boyfriend what had happened and he was *phenomenal*. He asked if I wanted him to fly back from the other end of the country, encouraged me to go to the doctor, but didn't push anything. I had trouble reaching my PCP, so he called and made the appointment for me. At work one of the clients asked me if everything was okay. If this man could figure out I wasn't okay, I realized I probably wasn't coping as well as I had thought. 

After work I went to the ER at the hospital where my PCP is based. I still couldn't say the words out loud, so I went in with a post it note, handed it to intake and waited for triage. The triage nurse called for the RCI team, and in less than 24 hours I was getting the medical care I needed. I was there for seven hours, in a private room. The staff was sensitive, they didn't push for details, they laid out my options clearly. I had taken Plan B that morning, so they gave me a cocktail of antibiotics, and took lots of blood to test. The hospital social worker came in, as well as the local rape crisis team. While I was at the hospital my boyfriend was coming home; he stayed with me Tuesday and Wednesday night. I saw my therapist yesterday, and am going back today. I have a follow up appointment with the infectious disease department on Friday.

In regard to the man, we ended the ""date"" that I should call him. I didn't want to not call him and have him call me, so I reasserted some power, and texted him. I said ""I've been thinking a lot about last night and what happened was not okay. You didn't listen when I said no, when I set limits, or when I asked you to stop. I feel like you didn't respect me. I don't think we should see eachother again. If that changes I will let you know."" His response was that I was just hung up on my boyfriend (aside to new readers, I'm in an open relationship), and I couldn't handle being a little out of control, but he would delete my number and asked me not to contact him. Really I think this was the best case scenario. 

The crying has slowed, I'm not as easily startled, I even laughed this morning. I still can't wear my hair down, and I haven't been undressed except fast showers. It's going to take some time, but I'm going to be okay. Thank you all again.

I don't have the heart to just come out and say, ""I don't want to swallow because I hate the taste.""  I don't even want to catch it in my mouth anymore, because if I spit it somewhere, I can still taste it as it goes over my tongue.  It literally makes me cringe (and then gag) if I taste it anymore.

I have talked to him about it and sort of alluded to the fact that I find it offensive, but I just can't come out and tell him I don't give him blowjobs to completion anymore because I cannot stand the taste.  In all honesty I never did; I just put up with it in the beginning to please him and I think forcing myself to do it made me dislike it even more.

I feel like an asshole because he goes down on me without complaint (loves it, and says so) but I haven't let him get off in my mouth in months.  I DO still go down on him a lot, just not until he gets off.


EDIT: You all have given me a lot of great ideas to work with, thank you!  I guess if all else fails I'll sit down and talk to him but after sharing the issue with you awesome twoxers, I see I have a lot more options than I realized!

After last night I feel so completely empty. I could seriously use your advice/thoughts. Throwaway is just for privacy. Lemme start at the beginning:

Since like early high school years, I've never been really attracted to someone. I recognized physical appeal, sure. But that didn't really make me want to *be* with them. And anyone who actually had an attractive personality wasn't physically attractive. So I just never was with anyone; my last (and first) boyfriend was a 2-month middle school affair, and I'm now 22. I've been approached by guys, but I guess I always thought they were being disingenuous. To be fair, none of them were sweet; they’re mostly solicitous. 

But I still have le sexy urges. And for the last several months I've gotten so tired of masturbating because every time I do, I feel like it just reminds me that no one thought it worthy to be there with me.

So I fucking went the Craigslist route. What the fuck was I doing. We talked for a looong time before I ended up going over there, about we should feel comfortable with each other, etc. We laid down and talked for a while and eventually I told him to kiss me. Um, it. Was. Terrible. But he just really went for it, and I felt like I owed it to *myself* to return whatever he gave to me. Maybe if someone just invested in me, I could reciprocate and maybe that would be what relationships are and I could be a normal human being. 

One thing led to another. I didn't know what the hell I was doing, seriously. By the time we were at me straddling him with our shirts off, I was ready to be done because I just was not into it. Buuut it kept going. I stopped him when he got out the condoms and since even I could tell my blowjob was sub-par, I ended up giving him a handjob until he came. And then the night was fucking over. I hadn't cum, and despite his oral efforts I really wasn't even that wet. I probably should have left just then, but I couldn't justify just going over there for sexy times if I hadn't even… had… sexy times. So I might as well stay for the companionship? But of course we slept like shit and now I'm home.

I don’t understand where I'm going wrong. You shouldn't have to force attraction, right? Is this an intimacy thing or an asexual thing or an inexperience thing? ‘Cause at the moment I want to punch myself in the face for all eternity.

I went to my school clinic and they thought it might be the flu. On Tuesday I had the urge to pee a lot, and the pee was super smelly and dark.  I knew it was probably a UTI, but I called my mom and asked and she said it could be dehydration. I emailed the school nurse (it was after hours) and she said to come back on Wednesday morning. 

I tested positive for a UTI/Kidney infection. It has been a horrible week that has been filled with the fever, chills, sweats, headaches, back pain, and groin pain.

My mom said, ""This should be a sign from God telling you you should be be having sex.""

(Okay, that bothered me because my boyfriend and I communicated expectations before, he was incredibly patient and receptive, and didn't do anything to hurt me. I wanted to have sex, and I'm on the pill and we used condoms.)

The only worry I have is that I fear that this will be a chronic thing. I did order a bottle of D-Mannose, which I saw a lot of people rave about, but what else can I do to prevent this torture in the future, because I have missed a week of classes from the fever, the pain, and my mom taking me home.

I've read all about how the skeins(?) gland stores liquid, and that if you go pee before you do it, your bladder will be empty so it can't possibly be pee.

And yet I'm still not totally convinced it's not pee.  I remember doing it back in high school, before I knew such a thing existed, and being both amazed and confused by the wet spot it always left.  I don't require any g-spot stimulation at all; it's entirely clitoral.  And it doesn't happen all the time.  Plus, it seems to be connected with hydration--if I'm hungover or just haven't had any water all day, for example, I can't really squirt.  I've tried to do a smell test, but I can't really smell the difference (well-hydrated pee doesn't smell like pee!).  It doesn't really squirt at all but is more like a gush.  

So, ladies, what do you think?  How do you *know* it's not pee?

My partner wants me to try be more dominant in the bedroom. 

I'm not sure how to do this. He has suggested I be more demanding in what I want (like ""go down on me now""), be a little more grabby, or be a little more forceful (like pushing his head, which care, down to my crotch). But other than that we can't really think of other things that I could do to be more helpful.

We didn't start trying to have intercourse until a few months before we were married, but we didn't actually succeed (in my opinion) until just a few months ago.  Every time he tried to enter me, it would hurt a lot, and my pain would make him go soft, and then it was pretty much game over, and it never got any better.  

I've only been to a gynecologist once, when I was eighteen, but she didn't mention anything unusual then, so I'm not sure what the problem was, but after months of such failure, I finally bought myself a small dildo, and used it to get myself used to the intrusion.  It was uncomfortable, but not outright painful like the real thing, and since my husband would go soft fast in our real sessions, the unflagging rigidity of the toy helped me grow accustomed to the sensation.  

We've been having proper sex about twice a week for about two months now, and it's not so painful any more, but it's not really comfortable either, and it certainly isn't going to make me come any time soon.

We've been together for 3 years and he is the only person I've ever had sex with.  

Our relationship is good and in a stable place.  We always try to communicate clearly about our problems, worries and anything else that may be bothering us.  As for the sex I'm not exactly sure how I would classify it.  I don't dislike it and I do in fact enjoy many parts it.  However, it takes a lot of mental effort for me to get excited and I have never gotten especially close to orgasm.  During the start of our relationship when we first started having sex I was just trying to get used to all the sensations and understanding the physicality of it all.  As time has gone by I have I have learned to relax and enjoy the physical aspects (kissing, penetration, skin on skin contact) but I've never gotten extremely aroused and I think the main cause of this is that I'm not particularly attracted to my boyfriend's body.  For the record I identify as bisexual as I do feel sexual attraction for both men and women so the issue of not being aroused by men is not an issue.

Recently I've been feeling dejected about sex.  My boyfriend is always telling me how much he loves the sex we have and how attracted he is to me.  Although I enjoy the sex he knows I don't get as much pleasure out of it as he does and he wants me to be happy.  He's very receptive to suggestions and is always asking me what he can do to make the sex better.  The problem is that I don't feel physically attracted to his body which makes it very hard for me to get aroused in the first place.  My boyfriend is slightly overweight and I find myself being attracted to men who are more slender.  I know that if I ever told him this it crush him as he is very sensitive about his body image and I don't want it to cause a rift between us.  Several years ago before I met him he used to be much heavier and when he was growing up he used to be bullied about it so I know he feels very self conscious about his body.  I don't feel grossed out by his body, just sort of neutral in that it doesn't do anything at all for me when I look at him but I feel that it is imperative for me to be attracted to my partner if I'm going to sexually satisfied.  

The thing is though, is there even any point in me telling him because if I do it doesn't necessarily mean it would change any of his behaviors which contribute to his current body and even if I express this he's not obligated to change his body for me.  I've just been keeping it to myself because I don't want to hurt him but at the same time I've been feeling very sexually frustrated and unsatisfied lately due to the lack of attraction.  What would be recommended to do in a situation like this?

I couldn't do it, I just sat and browsed the internet on my phone while he sat there, until he got up and started cleaning the kitchen. What is wrong with me?!

I am highly mortified by this problem I'm about to describe, so I thought I would post it here in TwoXSex to see if anyone had ever experienced or heard of this before.  Hopefully you can help (or direct me to another subreddit that could help!).

My sex drive varies from moderately active to slightly less active than average.  I am also fairly sexually inexperienced.  While I would like to have more sexual relationships (particularly with a male friend I've been casually seeing) I am afraid to do so because of my past sexual encounters.

With my last (and only) sexual partner, we had excellent sexual chemistry until it became time for sex, during which I strangely lost all sexual interest in him and having sex (as if I was not attracted to him at all).  When I tried to give him a handjob, I felt absolutely no sexual attraction to either his cock or his reactions to my pleasuring him.  I felt...numb.  Even when he tried to touch my breasts or clit, I felt like I had frozen up.  Absolutely no pleasure.  It literally felt like I had no sexual attraction to him at all (despite how sexually appealing making out, ect, had previously felt.) I tried to make the most of it, but he could tell something was wrong (because the whole experience was highly unenjoyable for me).  That problem of being unattracted to him during sex continued throughout our relationship, which was short lived after that.

I thought that I might be asexual or homosexual for a while because of this (as I identify as bisexual/pansexual) but I still find men sexually attractive.  I also thought that my loss of attraction might have come from anxiety because of my sexual inexperience, but I worked on that issue and it hasn't helped.

Does anyone have any advice on what this might be or how I can fix this?  I don't think this is normal!  If it helps, I have an active sex life on my own and also 22 years old.

We haven't always seen eye to eye (heh) but recently, things are looking up and I want to post something on the off chance that I can help someone else out there, because fuck knows it would have helped me a couple of years ago.
Inserting anything into any part of myself has always felt wrong. I was never the kid who put stuff up my nose, I have a healthy fear of using cotton buds. I was never able to use tampons before I started having sex. I tried a few times but could never relax enough for it to happen. I was always very naturally lubricated but my muscles have always been quite tight.


Enter boyfriend. He was very mindful about my comfort and never forced anything on me, rather he pushed my boundaries but would always respect if I needed to move back a few paces. Losing my virginity was a two day affair of testing my limits, pulling back, trying again until successful sexy times were had.
After that sex was always a little painful to begin with but would become enjoyable enough to orgasm a few times.
Until I got thrush. At least that's what I think it was. There wasn't any 'cottage cheese' like I had heard about in health class. In fact, there was no discharge, not even my normal amount. Seeing as there was no discharge, I thought that maybe it was my eczema and thought that it would sort itself out.


So off to the doctor I went. I remember telling her that I suspected I might have thrush and she took a swap and I was told I would get a call if anything was found. A few weeks later I hadn't heard anything and went back to the clinic and saw another doctor. She took one look and started writing out a thrush treatment. When I enquired about my test results, I was told they came back showing I had a staff infection but no one had contacted me at all about this.
Thrush cleared up in a matter of days on this treatment, however, I was still dry. All. The. Time. Sitting on certain surfaces or in certain pants was uncomfortable and sex was near impossible. Even with lube I felt a stinging sensation and unless I was on a heavy flow, using tampons would bring tears to my eyes. I saw a few different GPs at my clinic about possible treatments but they all seemed at a loss. It was suggested I see a gynaecologist and I chose a private on who was close to home.


By this point, sex had become something I would dread. It would hurt too much and so I would freak out to much to focus on arousal, which dried and tighten me up, which made it hurt.
On inspection, she found nothing wrong and after talking to me she gave me vaginal dilators to wear each night and slowly work up in size until I was ready for a penis.


At my last visit, I had worked my way up to almost penis sized and she quickly examined me to see my progress. I was told that I should be able to try having sex but I expressed concerns that I had been experiencing slight discomfort after having a dilator in for about 10mins. It would feel fine at first but soon a slight stinging feeling would creep up on me. It wasn't very painful, however, if I tried to move it in and out, it felt extremely unpleasant. My doctor looked at me and said ""Well if it feels fine and then suddenly hurts, don't you think it's in your head?"" No, I didn't say it suddenly starts hurting, I said it would start to hurt after some time. But I received the same ""I think it's in your head"" nonsense back at me and that was it. No attempt to refer me to any doctors or therapists who could help me from this point. I was so taken aback that I didn't realise I was angry until I got home.


A few months later I was at my GP clinic for a routine prescription and happened to mention my problem. I had done some research and asked if I could try an oestrogen cream. This angel of a GP listened to my history and told me that she also worked at the sexual health clinic and if I was willing, she would be able to run tests for free and I receive any possible medication for free as well.


At the sexual health clinic (I'm told my doctor is more thorough than most), I was tested for everything imaginable, just is case it helped. The doctor did a dot test wear she touched different parts of the vagina and I would rate the pain from 1 to 10. The first few dots were ok, one stung a little and one almost made me leap out of my chair. The pain was wear I had been experiencing the stinging sensation for years now and now I had proof it wasn't in my head! I given some oestrogen cream to thicken the area and told to go back in a few weeks. On my third visit, my third dot test resulted in no pain whatsoever. Nothing. It was a surprise to both me and my doctor how fast the treatment was working.


I'm only starting to work up the nerve to start having sex again. Sex has ended in pain and humiliation for longer than I ever enjoyed it and it's hard to get over that hurdle. I have been to a physio who specialises in vaginal issues and I've already learnt so much about my pelvic floors. I always had a super human ability to hold my wee and apparently that hasn't bee helping my situation. Soon, I'm hoping to see a therapist who can help me view sex as something positive again and who also facilitates couples therapy regarding these sorts of issues.
The reason for this post is that for so long I tried treatments that didn't work and had doctors shrug their shoulders because any vaginal issues look like all the other vaginal issues. I felt so alone and scared. I was scared I would lose my boyfriend and scared I would never have a healthy sex life.

I hope this helps.

Just to give you some background, I met this AMAZING guy about 2 months ago, and about a month ago he asked me to be his girlfriend. It's the first long-term relationship I've had since high school and the first time I've felt like a guy was worth real commitment in my adult life. I'm crazy about him. He is wonderful. As the icing on the cake, we have amazing sex. I expected all of the usual awkwardnesses of having sex with someone the first time and was pleasantly surprised when our first coitus felt more like sleeping with a long-time partner.

He is giving, attentive, enthusiastic, and creative in bed. He always puts my needs first and always asks what I want or need, even though I can never think of anything else he could possibly do for me.

The only problem is that he never cums. I don't know why or if it's more because he *can't* or more because he *doesn't want to*. At first he would just say he didn't want to because then we would have to stop, and I just thought he wanted to be sure he was pleasing me enough before he finished. Now we will be in the middle of having sex and he will stop right before climax because it ""feels too good.""

I've tried many things. I've told him I want him to finish if he wants to, I've told him he can pull out if he's worried. I've given him blow jobs and hand jobs for literally hours at a time. I've told him he can come anywhere he wants, on my tits or in my throat or on my face, some of which was taboo for me before, but now I would do it for him if it would help. When I give him HJs and BJs, he *usually* says he feels a moment away from cumming throughout the whole thing, but last week, he said he was cumming in my throat and  stopped himself. ^*sigh*

I just don't understand. I've been with enough guys before to know this is certainly unusual, but I'm not sure *how* unusual it is. I've never heard of a guy who couldn't/didn't want to finish, and again I'm not sure which it is with my boyfriend. I don't want to pressure him, because if he's still enjoying it and I'm satisfied, then I guess there's not really a problem. I just feel like maybe I've always linked cumming with satisfaction and there's a part of me that might always be self-conscious that I'm not doing enough for him unless he finishes.

I am scared to approach him about this outside of the bedroom because he has always glossed over it when we're in the moment, and I know I will put too much pressure on him if I try to talk about it during sex. Rational me knows it's really up to him and doesn't have to be a big deal, but heat-of-the-moment me gets frustrated and antsy about it. Maybe he's just one of those guys who gets really emotional after cumming. I honestly don't know, but I would love feedback or advice.

**TL;DR** My boyfriend completely satisfies me, but has a glans of iron and I'm worried he doesn't finish because he isn't satisfied.",,False,,t5_2uczz,False,,,True,t3_1g7zyi,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/1g7zyi/a_guy_who_will_not_finish/,

First of all, here's my original post for those who are interested: http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/1e62ek/cant_stand_the_taste_when_my_guy_ejaculates_in_my/

I wanted to keep everyone who was kind enough to offer their advice updated on the situation.  Sorry it's so long.

I suggested the masque strips to my S.O. thinking it would maybe help break the ice on the touchy subject or at the very least hint that part of the reason I haven't been going down on him as much is because of the taste.  Well, he liked the idea but I don't really think he ""got"" that I was suggesting it because of the taste problem.

So I decided I would have to talk to him about it.  I kind of just decided to go for it when the topic began to come up.  I realized there would simply be no ""ideal"" time to say what was on my mind so this evening when we were talking about sex already, I mentioned it.  And it didn't go so well at first.  I really think I hurt his feelings a little, and by telling him that part of the reason I stopped doing it completely was because I forced myself to do it too much made HIM feel like the jerk - not what I had intended at all!  And it made him bring up a few issues too, which sort of came out of nowhere for me.  

Apparently his no. 1 grievance with me is that I don't seem into it when I go down on him.  It was a truly WTF moment for me because even though I haven't done it to completion for him in two months, I go down on him regularly and I LOVE it.  So I was confused and upset that apparently all this time I have been doing it in such a way that takes some of the enjoyment out of it for him!

I told him the only time I might not be into it is when I'm afraid he'll be expecting me to do it until he gets off, and these days it seems he only wants to get off in my mouth.  He always asks, and more and more I'll say no, but my chest/stomach is perfectly fine.  So for example, if I'm on my period and I go down on him, I know that he's expecting me to finish him and as SOON as he asks to go in my mouth, yes, I am less into it.  It made me feel uncomfortable to say no to that because I was afraid of hurting his feelings if I said WHY I wasn't interested.

He also told me when we do it as foreplay that I seem way less into it than when I randomly do it for him out of the blue.  He told me when we do it before sex, I seem like I'm doing it just to get it out of the way, or doing it simply as something that will lead to sex.  He'd ""rather I just enjoy it for what it is and get lost in the moment.""  I really don't know what to do about this because a., he's right about me not being that into it during foreplay *sometimes* and b., apparently even when I AM into it, he can't tell.

So I guess this issue opened up a whole new can of worms but I suppose it's better that we're talking about it and our individual issues are now out in the open.

So any advice on how I can be more ""into"" it when I go down on him?  Because honestly I feel like if I consciously do anything else to signal that I'm enjoying it, I'll be faking it.  I really am confused by how I don't seem into it (he can't pinpoint what it is that makes him feel that way, says it's just a ""feeling."")  I also just don't know what I can do differently that isn't just me being fake!

And just FYI, the swallowing thing isn't a huge issue at this point.  I told him the ONLY think I don't like is the taste and that if I can figure out a way to get past that much, I'll be glad to do it again.

This kept up through spring semester, and while it was driving me up a wall, he was doing a VERY difficult major. I understood.

Now it's summer though. There is no real excuse anymore. The sex has gotten *better*, but that means going from thirty seconds to MAYBE five minutes if I'm really lucky. Now it's getting frustrating for both of us. My husband thinks everything's fine and that I'm over reacting by asking for more. I feel like I'm just getting worked up, and then he's done.

Anyone else in my boat?,KTcube,27,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/10ql5k/recovering_from_abstinenceonly_education_anyone/,"I'm from the USA, and my school basically taught us that sex should only happen in marriage and for procreation. According to them, if you had sex outside of marriage you would get pregnant (no matter how much protection you used!) and get STDs. They made it seem like sex could only happen in marriage, rape, or drunken mistakes.

The school also took this approach to alcohol education. There was no such thing as ""a glass of wine in the evening"". It was either no alcohol at all or being a homeless alcoholic with no family and cirrhosis of the liver.

I've been out of high school for a little over a year now and I've learned that what they taught me is complete horse-shit. I still have a lot of emotional residue though, and it's really hard for me to ask for sex, or even to say ""yes"" when I want it and my boyfriend asks.

I just learned that the BC pill and condoms are effective at preventing pregnancy last summer. (We were basically told that you will get pregnant no matter what, and condoms all have holes in them and birth control pills cost $2000 a month.)

Most of the lesbians in my high school had terrible relationships, and I think that part of it was because the education system won't even acknowledge that the relationships exist, let alone that they have problems that should be handled by professionals.

The school made me a slut-shamer. They taught us that females who have sex before marriage are filthy and diseased, and that ""having sex before marriage will ruin your reputation"". Well, maybe if the school didn't teach us that sex ruins our reputations then it wouldn't ruin our reputation. They basically told us that contraception doesn't work, and I'm sure that a lot of the girls from my school who got pregnant thought ""Well, I'm about to have sex, and health class said that condoms don't work so I guess it doesn't matter if I use one or not.""

Anyone else want to rant with me?

Is there anything that a girl who was taught abstinence and is now having sex should know? (I'm on Depo-Provera and only have one partner right now. And I know that when I get new partners we should get tested before having sex.)

tl;dr: My high school taught me that sex can only happen in marriage, rape, or drunken mistakes. Now I'm having responsible sex and I'm pissed that my school was so irresponsible in educating me.

Honestly. I was much too intimidated to post it in r/sex. Throwaway account, obv. I hope I don't come off as complaining, what I really need is advice.

My boyfriend and I have been together for over two years. In terms of husband material - he's it. Hands down. He's loving, sweet, kind, caring, generous, I could go on and on, but let's just say he's over all amazing.

While it's not so much a problem as a ""do want, very muchly"", he's never made me orgasm. He's tried, and perhaps what he does worked for his ex, it doesn't work for me. Add to the fact I've got baggage, and you get me not getting off with him. Ever.

My ex was the complete opposite of my current partner. He was selfish and self centered, especially in bed. While it was always appropriate for me to give him a blowjob, going down on me was rare, if ever. He was good at it, but hated doing it. And he had no qualms on letting me know exactly why. I'm going to be honest with you, ladies, and it really hurts me to type this all out.

Hated my pubic hair, once snapped at me that I tasted like ""pee"" (I was much more hygienic than he was, I took showers every day and he took them about twice a week if he was lucky) - thus cementing it into my mind that I somehow taste bad, didn't want to do it in the first place, was impatient, and didn't enjoy it.

So, despite the fact that my current guy is incredibly giving... I'm scared to let him go down on me. Whenever he does, I can't relax. I just focus on ""What if he doesn't want to do this? Does he feel forced? God, I hope I don't taste bad, or bleed. It's not going to happen, it's going to take too long and he's going to give up. Oh, and he'll have to leave after. So there's that time limit!"" Giving up has happened, and he feels terrible, and I kind of have a lady problem that involves bleeding after orgasm as a side effect sometimes. Yay.

I've asked him if I could show him what I do for myself, but the chance hasn't really come up. Usually it's straight into sex, and I never ask him to go down on me for the reasons listed above. To me, it feels like too much of a hassle and that it's not worth it. Saying that is making me tear up. I can't believe I'm letting my stupid, shitty ex get the better of me, but I can't help it. I usually just use a vibrator to get myself off after he leaves. It sucks.

However, I've noticed two things:

1. I usually feel extreme pain right when he penetrates me. He usually has to try two or three times before getting it in all the way. Once he's completely in there though, it doesn't hurt anymore. Even if he slips out mid-coitus and has to penetrate me again, it still doesn't hurt the same way.

2. Usually it feels okay for the first few minutes. Then, about four minutes or so into it, my vagina begins to feel all sore, and I just want it to be over (or at least I would if I weren't somewhat distracted from the pain by the sexiness of having his cock inside of me).

Any of you ladies have any idea why either one of these keeps happening, and if so, how I can fix it?

Additional facts that may help: I'm on the Pill, we're using condoms, I get very wet during foreplay but we still use tons of lube, we usually don't have intercourse until he's made me orgasm from foreplay, he usually thrusts very quickly, and lately we've been having a lot of missionary-style sex.

This isn’t really about sex exactly, but it’s about sexual attraction and I felt more comfortable posting it here than anywhere else. If you think it would be better suited somewhere else, please let me know.  

Now the problem I’m referring to in the title is probably the opposite of what you think it might be. I feel like I’m *too* monogamous. By this I mean that my boyfriend really is the only guy sexually attractive to me. I can see how other guys can be hot or good looking or cute or whatever, but past “he looks nice” there’s nothing. I don’t think about them longer than a second after noticing. I don’t think of any men other than my boyfriend sexually (weirdly I often think of women when we’re having sex/I’m masturbating or watching porn, but I’ve never looked at a woman and felt the same way as I’ve looked at a guy so I think it’s just one of those things).  

Now the problem is this: I feel like I’m doomed to a life of disappointment and misery because of this. I want my partner to feel this way about me, which is obviously pretty unreasonable. Whenever I think of my boyfriend thinking of someone other than me in that I way I’m filled with so much rage and resentment and hurt and all these horrible feelings which inevitably cause problems for us. I grudgingly accept that he watches porn. I really don’t like it and it makes me sick to think about it, but there’s no way I’d ever try to tell him not to. I get that most people are sexually attracted to people who aren’t there partner, it’s normal, but it makes me so sad.  

How the hell can I deal with this and get over it?? I don’t like how I usually try to make my boyfriend feel shame for watching porn (I get very defensive and bitter about it, insult any and everyone associated with it, tell him I don’t want to hear about it etc) and I have done the same any time he mentioned an actress he thinks is attractive. I hate this! I hate being this angry, bitter tyrannical shrew and I want my boyfriend to feel it’s ok to be a perfectly normal person. I hate that he has to keep this part of him from me to prevent me getting upset. I want to get rid of the feelings of pain and hurt I experience whenever it’s brought up because it’s not normal and it’s not healthy.

Part of my problem, I think, is the way I imagine guys think about attractive people. When I think someone’s hot, it’s a passing thing. I don’t think about them later, I don’t masturbate thinking of them, I don’t compare my boyfriend to them. However, I’ve somehow got it in my head that guys do all of those things. How can I possibly live up to someone he’s seen in porn or on the street knowing he’s seen me being gross and slobby? It’s like they’re the perfect ideal as he is only seeing them in that moment, whereas I’m the flawed reality. I feel like such a disappointment to him sometimes, even though he assures me he finds me incredibly attractive and whatnot. It’s also pretty obvious that I sometimes have issues with my self-esteem which are just adding to this mess. I say sometimes because sometimes I’ll be kind of ok with this whole thing and think “well whatever he thinks about them isn’t going to stop him from loving me”, but other times it’s like my mind goes he likes them = he likes them better THAN YOU and he’s either wishing you were like them or thinking of leaving you. This is clearly fucked up.  

So, twoXsex, please help me feel more comfortable with the idea that he’s going to like people other than me. Is there anyone else who has felt this way and managed to get over it? I dislike this part of myself very, very much. Thank you.

So I'm having trouble in bed with my partner. She really wants to have sex constantly (but nothing out of the ordinary, 'cause me too) but we rarely have the occasion to do so since we're barely legal and our families don't know about us, so getting some sexy time is difficult.

What's worse is that when we get it, *i'm often turned off*. Not because of anything she does, I just… I have trouble getting really turned on and I tire very, very fast. Suddenly, when we're making out, I just want to hug her and fall asleep in her arms. I used to think this was because when we have a chance to do this it is usually at night after getting drunk at some party and that I'm simply tired. But we've started to think it's deeper than that. She has suggested that it's because I don't actually like girls (but of course I do, I'm 100% sure) or that I don't like her (but that makes no sense, I'm madly in love with her and we've been together for 2 years).

Soooo… I think that maybe it's because I get bored (being two girls with no toys, there's not a lot of things that can be done- and, sometimes, we end up in group things. Not orgies, but almost. And I'm really turned on by these group dynamics, it's been a fantasy of mine for a long time), but maybe because I may have a porn addiction, because when I masturbate to porn, I orgasm *very* fast… and when I'm simply masturbating in bed, I usually just fall asleep. 

For men this problem of low libido related to porn addiction is very common, specially because they can have erectile dysfunction. I don't, but my girl has a lot more difficulty making me orgasm than she should. I think a solution is to stop watching porn… but should I stop masturbating as well? What do you think?

I'm at a loss here, and I feel ridiculously bad that having sex with me is causing him pain.

Im having a bit of an issue. My husband, whom I've been with for several years, hates blow jobs.

I can't figure it out. What am I doing wrong? How can I stop feeling hurt about it?

Couple notes:
1.I'm really good at giving them. When he lets me give them, he cums within minutes

2.I love giving them. It makes me horny!

3.We're faithful, and have only been with each other for years now

4.He's not always into having sex, meaning, his libido is low. Could that be part of it?

5.He tells me how attractive I am to him almost everyday, so it's not that.

6.I don't have herpes or any oral disorders


I worry a lot about this. What if he's secretly gay? 
I feel like a crazy horny wife who is always fighting her husband to get to his penis. It drives me nuts. Any tips on lowering libido would be awesome...it leaves me feeling unhappy all the time.

I was born and raised a member of a very conservative religion.  I quit attending church and following all the rules a little over a year ago, but only quit considering myself a member last August.  In October I lost my virginity to a dear friend of mine.  There's no chance of a relationship there, but I've had no regrets.  He and I have hooked up a few other times, but he's never spent the night... if that helps define things at all.

As bad as it sounds, I wanted to lose my virginity so I could have sex in the future without the awkward virgin talk.  Now that I've lost it, I realize that sex is like... fun, and would like to have a little more of it.  My friend is unavailable for multiple reasons.  So I go out with friends hoping to find a hot guy to hook up with. Honestly, this is the reason I go out - slip a condom in my purse and everything.

However, when the ridiculously hot guy asks me if I want to fuck... I still said no.  Even when the not so hot and possibly closeted gay guy asked me, I said no.  TWO propositions, no yes.  One I know is disease free because he's an awkward acquaintence of a friend.  Maybe it was he was way more drunk than I was.  I really don't know.  

I'm not the hottest girl.  I'm a size 18 woman with amazing breasts and a bit of a double chin when I look down.. but I'm fine with myself.  I think I'm afraid of being a regret?

If anyone has any advice I welcome it!

I am in my early 20s and I have suffered from heavy vaginal discharge from around when I was 12 years old (way prior to when I was sexually active) which was about the time I started puberty. I have always been very self conscious of this and thought I was odd. Only recently have I found out that discharge can sometimes be normal, yet I still have doubts. **I know I need to see a doctor and I have an appointment in the near future.** The main reason I am bothering to ask random strangers is because I am hoping to have at least some heads up as to whether I have something wrong with me. I don't want to burst into tears in the doctors office, so I would much rather get some advice first. 

I am to have my first gynecologist appointment coming up in a week or so, and it is way past due. I became sexually active around five years ago, and ever since then I have been even more worried about whether I am ""normal"" when it comes to vaginal discharge. The pictures I have to share very much gross me out, but are not what I consider abnormal. I am about a week away from getting my period, and I usually suffer from heavy discharge right beforehand. The two weeks after my period I usually don't have any, though I would say I can be very wet and often times soak through my undies. I mostly wear cotton underwear, but occasionally I will wear a thong or spandexy ones. 

As you can see in these photos, I have **a lot** of discharge going on today. It is all white and does not really have a smell, other than maybe salty. This is typical. The texture is a mix of creamy to slightly grainy. (oh god I am so sorry...) Also fairly typical. The weeks after my period usually have more of a wet, clear discharge and sometimes it feels just like water. I know when I was younger I used to fear I was peeing myself, not because I felt like I was peeing, but because it was SO wet. I also have noticed I have a small tear above my clitoris. This is common for me after sex, along with tears at the bottom of my vaginal opening. I did have sex two days ago now, and I knew at the time I felt a tear. My partner and I do use lube, but I'm not sure if it ever really makes a difference for me.

Okay, picture time. As I said, its not a pretty sight and I'm not sure if I am considered ""normal"" or not so I am sorry if its as disturbing to you as it is to me. Thank you for any thoughts, advice or insight.

He says he doesn't have a sex drive for me because he respects me too much and for him sex is supposed to be 'dirty' (he watches a lot of internet porn and I suspect that kills his libido). Honestly, I'm not even sure what I should do. I want to still be in a relationship with him, but the lack of sex is a wedge between us. He only gets sexually excited to see me after we have not seen each other for a few weeks, and even then it only lasts for a few (2-4) days usually. I just want to know if any of you have overcame your partner having a low libido/being overly accustomed to your body and somehow learned to deal with it or somehow raised your partner's libido. Any comments welcome.

EDIT:To expand, with his previous SO, apparently sex was the only positive factor in their relationship because she was ridiculously multiorgasmic. Meanwhile, I don't think I've ever had an orgasm, and I guess this makes him feel like there's no point and that I don't get anything out of it. So he faps.

We've been together for about a year and a half, but we haven't had sex yet because (a) we were both new to this whole ""dating"" thing and we were kind of awkward for a while, and (b) we're teenagers and neither set of parents ever willingly allows us to be alone in the house together.

So, we've figured out some stuff that we can do, and we've snuck around a little bit. A lot of the time, it'll just be making out and playing with my boobs. When possible it'll escalate to a blowjob at most. We've discussed him giving me oral, but he's not on board. (PIV) Sex has just never really been possible with the situation.

All of this I am okay with. I enjoy what we do (it's all fun and whatnot). But the thought of him going inside me is horrifying. I'm not opposed to the idea, but the *size* of it. Let's be real, his dick is not huge. But I'm pretty small (5'2"", 100 lbs) and I guess my vagina is too. Tampons are slightly uncomfortable for me, I don't think I could even get more than two fingers in there, and I don't know how an average-sized penis could fit at all. 

Once, we managed to sneak a couple of hours alone, so we decided to try. He got a condom, and got his dick about half an inch in before I almost started crying. I was pretty relaxed, and I shouldn't have been extra-tight or anything, but it **hurt.** I've read on here that I should loosen up after a few times, but I don't know if I could make it through that. 

The worst part is that my boyfriend still wants to have sex ASAP. I'm personally a little glad that we can't do anything about it right now. I don't know how to tell him how I feel, or what to do about it. He's going to college nearby in the fall, and a dorm room would allow us more privacy (probably).

I (20F) have been masturbating since around 2nd grade, or somewhere in there in elementary school - didn't know what it was at the time, just knew it felt good. :) I've always done it the same way: on my stomach, through my underwear, non-dominant hand (though that part doesn't probably matter...); I've never had an orgasm.

Obviously, I'd like to have an orgasm, but there are a couple things I'm having trouble with.  If I try to do just finger-to-skin contact (not through clothes), I can't get the same stimulation or something and it doesn't keep me turned on. Similarly, I've tried on my back and I just don't stay turned on. Any suggestions on how to change styles?

Part of my motivation for wanting to achieve orgasm is the fact that I've recently started having sex with my (awesome) bf, and he's really great about trying to get me off but also not making a huge deal out of it when I don't cum, which I love, but I'd love to be able to reward him for his efforts! But even if he goes down on me, I'm on my back and I can't seem to stay aroused! I don't get it!

So yeah...I guess my main question is just how can I work towards getting off? Any suggestions are appreciated. :)

My friend recently got out of a long relationship with a guy that was *not* right for her, and she has been making amazing strides to improve herself and her life this year and I am way proud of her. She recently started seeing guys on OKCupid. She went on a few dates and then started seeing this one guy pretty regularly. He seems nice, from what I've heard, but I haven't met him yet.

After a few dates she started inviting him up to her apartment to watch TV, which always ended up with them making out on the couch, but she always stopped it before it got to sex. He seemed fine with it, and they even had a conversation about how she was looking for a more serious relationship than just sex and wanted to go slow and he agreed. I'd actually been encouraging her to go for it since she has been complaining about not having sex since her last relationship.


Apparently they had sex tonight, and she was not happy about it. She just called me up feeling really uncomfortable about it. Apparently they had been making out on the couch, he took her shirt off and she was fine with it, but when he started taking her pants off she told him to stop. Then it happened again and she told him to stop. Then it happened again and she just went with it, did not enjoy it at all, and then told him to leave afterwards. Apparently when he realized she was upset he really wanted to stay and talk about it, but she just didn't want to be around him anymore. But she still thinks he's a nice guy who just didn't understand and she thinks she'll keep seeing him.

What do I say to her? I'm torn between being really offended by his behavior and telling her he's a jerk, and thinking that she's the best judge of her experience, so I should let her make her own choices about whether he acted inappropriately.

Firstly, I am devoutly religious, and I believe in waiting for sex until marriage. HOWEVER! That is not the major issue. For my entire life I've been extremely harsh to my body (eating disorder, among other things) and I've NEVER touched myself sexually. Ever. It's gone beyond a practice of faith, and has morphed into my own insane repression. 

As I've grown, I've developed a much more loving relationship with my body, but I still have a hard time wrapping my head around pleasure. I still don't understand how any man could look at this fleshy thing I live in and like what they see. I don't have any glaring health/weight issues, and I look like any other 20-something-year-old. All of this paranoia is inside. 

My question: how do I thaw myself out? I've never orgasmed. I think I've gotten off in dreams because I feel this pitch of happy physical crazy while sleeping which I never feel when awake. I've had boyfriends who've gotten very handsy, and while I can feel the slightest of excitement, I still feel mostly numb. 

What can I do to just be a sexual creature for once in my life? I've read other stories about women who humped and grinded as little girls and got that first experience of wonder/curiosity out of the way--but imagine if that never happened. Imagine a stern little girl who thought everything like that was dirty. What can I do to leave that little girl behind? I'm tired of living like this. 

Just an aside: I don't have severely repressive parents, this has actually arisen mostly from within myself. Also, I won't watch porn due to religious beliefs, just in case that would be your suggestion.

1. If i'm squirting, does that mean i'm having an orgasm? or, will i now squirt when i do orgasm? because sometimes when i squirt, it feels like a release of pressure. but other times i don't even notice until i feel how suddenly wet it is
2. Every time my boyfriend makes me squirt, it's in the same position. Does that mean i can only squirt in that position or something? or could i do it in another position that produced the same feeling? i really dunno what makes me squirt haha

Second part of this is focused on orgasms. outside of squirting, i think i've finally also reached orgasm? i'm not so sure though, cause it felt pretty mild/i was also high. like, we were going at it and everything felt really intense. toes curling, finger nails digging into my SO and then finally i just felt really good and relaxed (no squirting though). almost tired. sometimes i have feelings of this during sex, but usually i'm good to continue with the sexy times. but this specific time it felt so amazing that i was ready to be done. i just wanted to lay there and bask in the good feels. truly one of the best feelings ever.

so is it possible i just had a mild orgasm or something? i only ask because i've never had another feeling like it, but it wasn't what all the hype of the what big-o led me to believe (no uncontrollable body thrashing/screaming haha)

we were doing doggy style and he was hitting my G spot perrrrrfectly. lots of squelchy sounds. oh yeah. i flip over onto my back and there is pure white ladycum on the bed.

i was pretty shocked! i've never had such white cum before, it's always been clear. i chalked it up to the intensely pleasurable G-spot squelching but i also have a tiny little worry in my brain that it could be something negative.

any advice ladies? it is much appreciated.

I've been a long time lurker and now I've finally worked up the courage to post.

I'm a 21 year old female and I've never been able to orgasm. I've been with 12 partners. Some of them were long term relationships (longest was four years) and some were one-night stands. I've tried quite a variety positions and types of sex and foreplay.

I've also been pleasuring myself solo for years, trying all sorts of methods and toys. However, I've found that I really enjoy sexual activity with a partner more and get little out of the sensation of touching myself. The closest thing I can do that resembles an orgasm is when I deliberately and consciously tighten my body up as I rub myself and then relax the muscles suddenly as I stop. While this feels good, I really wish I could experience the real thing.

I am not on birth control, hormones, or medications. While I am a bit more stressed than usual, i haven't been able to finish under my least stressful times. I'm familiar with the FAQ and have read hundreds of additional articles and forums and tips on the topic. I've worked on relaxing and not fixating on it. While I'd love to see a sex therapist someday, I attend a very small rural college and do not have access to such services at this time.

I would love some further advice or suggestions. Are there any other women who are unable to orgasm and would be willing to share how they have dealt with this? I'm starting to get discouraged and while my sex life with my current boyfriend is the best I've had and my libido is high, I don't want to let it negatively effect the positive things I have going on now.

1355268365.0,22,self.TwoXSex,14oxyu,Plea for help with sexual mechanics! Is it too difficult to overcome? (Kind of long),witsendtaw,23,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/14oxyu/plea_for_help_with_sexual_mechanics_is_it_too/,"Hey there TwoXsex. I really need some help here. I would post this to /r/sex (I still might, who knows), but my partner frequents it. I'm not comfortable with him finding this randomly, even though he is the one who suggested I write to the almighty reddit gods for advice in the first place. 

I'm normally a very open person about sex -- I majored in gender and sexuality studies, work with a sexual health organization, and am a go-to source for my friends about anything and everything related to sex. That's why I'm at my wit's end here--I feel like I should be able to fix this but nothing I try is helping.

Ok, so. My current sexual partner and I (there's a whole lot more to tell there but since most of it isn't relevant I'll keep it simple – we are both in our early 20s and have been dating both exclusively and nonexclusively over the past 6 months or so) are having way too much trouble having sex than we should be. We talk about everything and our communication about our issues is definitely not the problem, but neither of us can figure out what to do. It's just... nothing seems to work. Almost no position we try is pleasurable for me, and when it is, I'm having trouble making myself comfortable enough to truly just enjoy it. I have had a good number of partners and experiences and am confident in my body, but there are still things and positions that I don’t feel as comfortable with as I would like to (mainly those involving me on top or a large distance between him and me—I am very conscious of my facial expressions when he can see ALL of me, even though I know I shouldn’t be. It’s something I need to work on).

I’m not used to his body type, which makes positions that I know I enjoy almost impossible/unpleasurable. We’ve tried different angles, pillows, leg and arm positions, etc, but it’s still just… not there. The pillows help a little, but not as much as we hoped. I’ve had similar issues with the only other partners I’ve had with similar body types, so I do think this is somehow related. 

Also: I don’t want to potentially blame it on something silly, but his penis is smaller (in girth and length) than my last sexual partner’s, which I also think is making it harder for me to really… feel anything. It’s not dramatic, but even the slight difference might be impacting us somehow. I’ve also had this experience in the past as well.

I personally have been dealing with some emotional issues (anxiety/depression) since we have been together, but I don’t think this is to blame for all of our problems. Some, yes, but mostly those relating to frequency and desire. For being involved with each other for almost 6 months, we have not had sexual contact nearly as much as we both feel we should have/want to. That does probably affect our comfort level with some sexual acts, but given how open and understanding we are and how willing we are to try, it just doesn’t explain everything. And the mechanical problems occur even when the desire is there.

He has his own slew of problems that also are impacting us-- he comes incredibly fast from penetrative sex, oral, handjobs, anything, at least the first couple of times in a session. I don’t necessarily have a problem with this, I’m just not used to it. He is used to coming multiple times whenever he has sex, and I’ve never had that experience with another partner. He doesn’t enjoy coming that quickly, and he says it’s not really something that has happened quite like this before (he chalks it up to a lack of masturbation, which he is trying to fix, his work schedule, and an incredibly strong desire/attraction to me). I have supported him with this as much as I can in trying to make it work, but I frequently feel almost afraid to touch or overstimulate him too early whenever we play, and as a result have begun to second guess my own abilities. I don’t feel like I can do any of the things that I want to or are good at, because it’s just too much. I’ve done a pretty good job at finding other ways to stimulate him that don’t make him come right away, but even then I feel like I’m barely doing anything at all. The kind of sexual play that I feel like I need – harder, deeper, purposeful thrusting—is too much for him the first few tries, and at that point I lose interest/desire in continuing to try (even though he can continue to get hard pretty quickly after coming). In trying to make sure he is OK, I feel like I am not even there sometimes.

When we first got involved, we very quickly opened up to each other about our sexual needs, desires, experiences, fantasies, etc – perhaps too quickly. Did we shoot ourselves in the foot? Sometimes I feel like our extreme openness in the beginning was too much, and because we haven’t been able to live up to what we feel we should be able to do, we get discouraged. Is that even possible?

I’ve gotten to a point where I feel that, because of all the problems we are having, I have such strong negative/discouraging associations with our sexual experiences together that I’m not sure I can overcome them and salvage anything. There are so many places I feel we could go, but I don’t know how to get there anymore. 

Help me out here. Is the situation hopeless? What new things can we try to make sex pleasurable for us both? Positions, toys, location, anything I am missing? I can elaborate on anything anyone feels is necessary to truly give your opinions. 

**TL;DR – Partner and I are having way too many mechanical issues with sex. Can we overcome them, or is the situation hopeless?**

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years. Previously I had been with a few others but both myself and my SO have been tested multiple times for STDS and we are both clean. In the beginning of our relationship we had constant sex with no issues. Within the past six months, sex has become very painful/uncomfortable and it is beginning to hurt our relationship since I am now becoming put off by sex.

We have tried using several different based lubes, but we do not use condoms since I am on birth control and we are both clean. The pain and discomfort often comes mid-way through sex and gets even worse after we are done. Urination is very painful after sex. It's more of a burning sensation by that point.

I've visited both my gynecologist, and my regular doctor. I've been tested for UTI's, and STD's and eveything has come back negative. I am just hoping someone may have had similar experiences and may offer some advice before it ruins our relationship :(

Advice?,snailsecks,23,2,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/10qexh/bf_doesnt_last_very_long_during_sex_advice/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost two years, and he doesn't last very long when we have sex. 

The last time we did it he didn't even last a minute. It normally lasts under five minutes. If it lasts longer, he has to go really slow the whole time so he doesn't come fast. He helps me get off afterwards, so I can't really complain to him I guess.

We've always had problems with our sex life it seems. I'm just never satisfied. I get to climax every time, but I just want a good dicking, and I only get it every once in awhile.

I've thought about (without the intention to follow through) cheating on him just so I can get a good long fuck. It feels way better when he goes fast, but this makes him come really quickly.

He doesn't even apologize. I think I'd be okay with it if he made an effort and we did it again like an hour later when he got his stamina back or whatever. But that's just it. Two to four minutes, then done for the day, maybe even week.

Like I said, we've had other problems. We live together and I'd like to do it almost daily, but he says he's either stressed or tired. This isn't why he comes quickly though, because he's always been that way. He says he doesn't really know how to last longer. Every once in awhile, he'll be able to last a long while, but more times than not, it's over right when it starts feeling good.

I don't know what to do. I really want to do it longer, but he just can't last that long. He can't last very long at all. I don't want longer foreplay. It bores me usually, compared to the actual penetration part of sex, and sometimes makes him come even faster. I just want sex that lasts at least ten to fifteen minutes once he sticks it in.

Can anyone give me advice on how to change that?,asexualbf,29,7,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/19l1ev/my_boyfriend_isnt_as_into_sex_as_i_am_can_anyone/,"We have sex about once a week unless I beg for more (this will get me 2-3 times a week). If I asked for it, it's not that he would turn me down, but he is just as happy to sit on the couch for an extra hour every night than head to bed a little early for sexy times. 

Also, he is my first and only. We only have about two positions we alternate between. I desperately want to experience more! But he makes me feel unsure about myself sexually because I feel like he never wants it, so it must be a problem with me (he insists it isn't and that he just doesn't think about having sex more until I complain), that I would be way too nervous to suggest anything specific for us to try. 

I ask him all the time if there is ANYTHING AT ALL he wants to give a go. ANYTHING. AT. ALL. Toys? A new position? Role play? ANYTHING? Nope, he says he is satisfied with our same two positions. I ask if he has any fantasies, because I would gladly act them out with him. He says he doesn't. 

Ladies, this absolutely makes me want to cry. I feel so frustrated. I love what we do, of course, it is really good. But I want to experience more and try more. I want to try toys and roleplaying and every position under the sun, but he just doesn't seem into it. He says he would try out anything for me, but I feel so discouraged because I know it's not what he wants too. 

What should I do? I want to make him a more sexual being, but I don't know how or if it's even possible. 


A couple notes on his history that might help out:
-He didn't masturbate for the first time until he was in high school. 
-He hesitates to admit he's ever looked at porn, and I'm pretty sure he hasn't looked at porn in years
-I sent him sexy pictures when I was away for a week in December and he told me that most he did was touch himself a little
-His ex before me had tons and tons and tons of problems. She was so mentally messed up and was on so much medication because of her mental problems that they would only have sex like once every three weeks, and I'm pretty sure she was basically never into it. 


EDIT: Another bit of history that might give you some insight... one of my girl friends who was trying to help me with this problem took me to a sex shop and suggested little things I could try. I ended up buying some lingerie, flavored lube, and a vibrating cock ring. He laughed at the cock ring and never wanted to try it. I ended up throwing it away, and months later he asked if I wanted him to put it on for me. He doesn't notice when I wear lingerie. And he said blow jobs aren't that great, so the flavored lube has no use.

OK, this seems silly and I don't really talk about it...
I always thought women weren't into masturbating, I thought that was normal. I'm in my second year of university, and I've been on reddit for about 6 months; so I've noticed and heard a lot of women talking about how much they love masturbating, the types of vibtrator's they own etc... and I'm starting to realise that maybe it's not so abnormal as I thought.

Now, I do get sexual urges, but when I start to get 'hot and heavy' and my hand goes 'down there' I start to feel... dirty (and not the good kind of way), and I stop.

I remember when I was in my early teens and this started to happen; I wasn't a religious person but for some reason I would ask God for forgiveness... I'm an atheist now but even still I feel like I should be ashamed.

I've had sex twice. The first time was horrible... the second time I don't remember. My first kiss and I guess foreplay was when I was 15, and it was an older man (I look back later and realised that I was being used; I had the body of a woman, but not the mind).

I've looked at adult shops on the net, but I've never bought anything, I've read erotica, but when it gets too intense I shut the page (that's the same for porn)... I just don't know what to do. I was thinking maybe I'm asexual, but I get sexually aroused and I love men; that being said I feel more comfortable around women, and sexually I fear men a bit (but that's a whole 'nother kettle of fish).

I've never spoken about this before. Can any women give me some advice? I'm turning 20 next year, and I want to... I don't know... feel normal, I mean bloody hell, it's the 21st Century! I'm meant to be this 21st Century independent women, and I can't even masturbate! Which angers and saddens me.

He was so nervous about it and all and it kept making me afraid that he would back out. He started drinking earlier that day to calm him down and we both smoked pot from his hookah and I gave him a lose dose Xanax to calm him down, so he had a good buzz and calm going on when we moved to his room. We set all of the stuff on his nightstand and this is when I first got to see what the strap on actually looked like and damn it was huge. For someone who was nervous about doing this he sure surprised me with that. It was 8"" and thick. Slowly and with lots of lube I inserted one and then two fingers. While inside him I would try to separate my fingers and stretch him out. He smelled this little bottle that had some liquid in it meant to expand the blood vessels. It made a huge difference and I felt him loosen up and it made things a lot easier. He grabbed one of his smaller dildos (4"" and not as thick) and we started with that. Tons of lube was so important to making things work and giving him the most pleasure. His moaning and the amount of pleasure he was receiving was mind blowing. Because of all of the lube and me not realizing how short the dildo was it did slip out a few times which did mess up the flow of things and it was hard to reinsert at times but we just laughed it off and kept going. When I was fingering him he was on his back but when we used the dildo he was in doggy which I found made the initial insertion a lot easier. He flipped over onto his back again and asked me to just leave it there while I mounted him and we had sex. 

We never ended up using the harness or the larger dildo because he felt that he was not ready for something that size. It was still something new for him to have someone else control the movement of the dildo because usually something like that or anything more than one finger was private for him. We talked about it later and he mentioned that if we had not had so much trouble keeping the shorter dildo in that he would have cum from it without even having to touch himself which made me feel good about everything. After I left to go home from the weekend he told me that he would work on preparing himself for the larger dildo and that it is something he wants to do alone and that once he can do it then, that we will use the harness and try again. I enjoyed it a lot and so did he. It was a fun weekend and I can't wait for the two of us to have another go at it. 

Thanks to those who gave advice. I did get to use some of it which made things easier for me and will remember the other advice given when I get to use the harness. :)",,False,,t5_2uczz,False,,,True,t3_x4o9k,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/x4o9k/pegging_updated/,

It's something I really, really want to do, not just to get it over with, but I'm a very sexual person, and just kinda crave it. I've done literally everything else, and never *avoided* sex, it just never really happened - the moment was never right, and there was never really any privacy.

The thing is, people who are virgins past high school are sometimes seen as ""odd"". Guys either don't want to deal with it, or have worries that virgins will get attached (a la Soshanna in Girls).

Now, I don't *know* that I won't get attached, but that's really not me. It would be easier for myself and the guy that I've been seeing if he just doesn't know that I'm a virgin. None of my college friends know, and I just don't need that spreading around.

So I was wondering if anyone know if using a dildo beforehand would be a good way to a) not bleed, and b) not be in as much pain. 

I've waited so goddamn long for my first time, I'd really like it to be awesome, and not bloody and awkward and painful :[

1357552196.0,21,self.TwoXSex,164381,Squirted for the first time ever... via non-traditional method! It can happen to anyone!,ScorpioLatina,24,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/164381/squirted_for_the_first_time_ever_via/,"Dear /r/TwoXSex, not sure this is the right thread to share with, but... might as well try. Please redirect me to another appropriate subreddit that might appreciate this information as well if you know of it! I've always read that G-spot stimulation is the ultimate key to squirting, and although I can't say I was actively seeking vaginal orgasms and/or squirting, I did want to experience it. 

For some background, I actively masturbate, used to be almost everyday (sometimes several times a day) but since I started some drugs, maybe once a week now. I also am a lot more aroused during both sex and masturbation when my bladder is full. One of the main ways I get myself wet before even touching my clit is by pressing down on my lower abdomen towards my pubic bone. I think the reason why that feels good is because it is pressing against the bladder which in turn  presses against my G-spot. I exclusively masturbate by touching my clit, I find it physically tiring to finger myself trying to target my G-spot, and it feels nowhere as good as clit stimulation. I expressed my interest in squirting to my boyfriend and he did try a couple of times to make me squirt by aiming for the G-spot. Problem number one: I'm never soaking wet when this occurs which means after about 30 secs of thrusting, it starts to kind of hurt. Problem number two: When it does feel good I feel like I am going to pee on him, which would probably turn our sexual chemistry off for the rest of eternity lol. But biggest issue is because I know he's looking for some kind of spectacular ending and if I don't squirt I won't give it to him, I keep thinking about it the whole time and feel terrible for making him do so much work :(. So yeah, inhibition, biggest squirter blocker EVER. 

Anyways, got horny today, went about my business, and my playing with myself lasted longer, and it was not due the usual frustration at not getting aroused enough to orgasm (since I started taking the meds) but more of playfulness and everything I was watching was turning me on incredibly.  No idea why, as I had been doing my usual routine. Did not think much of it, it happened before. But when I came JUST from touching my clit (again, my bladder was full) I felt a trickle down my down-there lips. No, there was no mind-numbing full-body orgasm like the ones often associated with squirting, nor an uncontrollable gush of liquid. I felt a small wet spot on my sheets with my bum. This has never happened before. My first thought was ""Fuck you bladder, really do not need to go about changing my sheets this late at night."" When I turned on the lights, the spot did not seem to be yellowish at all, so I smelled it. Did not smell like anything. I assumed I did squirt for the first time. I was super excited!!

Anyways, Facetimed with my SO immediately after, and told him about it and showed him the spot. He said it must have been pee, was insisting on it quite vehemently actually. I later deduced that maybe he was feeling bad for not being able to make me come or that he was not a part of it. I dunno... he was just being quite weird and not interested for someone who had seemed quite ecstatic about wanting to make me squirt before. It kind of hurt, because this was a huge deal to me. 

After Facetiming, I wanted to prove to myself for some reason that this was not pee, it was squirt liquid! I started rubbing my clit again, and within minutes, I felt a slightly bigger trickle down my lips, and sure enough it dripped onto my sheets. As gross as this may sound, after smelling and visually inspecting the  spot, I tasted it. It was not pee. It didn't smell or taste like anything really, just clear fluid. 

What are your thoughts ladies? Do you think it is squirt liquid or something else I'm misinterpreting (given the lack of g-spot stimulation and whole-body orgasms)?

TL;DR Excreted clear, non-smelly fluid upon orgasm achieved solely by clitoral stimulation

I'm 17 and he's 19, we've been together for a year and a half and our relationship is going very well in all areas. 

So obviously as a 19 year old male, my boyfriend is going to masturbate. He's going to watch porn. I get it, and I really don't care. But today, when I went to go visit him (we're kind of long distance, since he lives in an apartment on campus while I'm still at home,) and things started getting frisky, he said he wanted to show me a video he found that he thought was ""**really** hot."" For some reason, though, I couldn't watch it. I felt awkward and embarrassed, which is weird because I've watched porn myself before. To me, it was almost like he thought this girl was better than me, and I won't deny that my self esteem isn't exactly the greatest to begin with. As soon as he turned around and saw that I was uncomfortable, however, he shut the video off and gave me a hug. 

So why am I like that? This isn't the first time it's happened, but it's only the third time maybe. I *know* he doesn't mean anything by showing it to me, and in all honesty he probably just wants to be able to watch it together, but I'm just really paranoid by nature and I tend to overreact.

I didn't start until I was nearly 16 (I'm 19), and have gone anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months between periods. I was on birth control because of this (and also because of skin issues which have since resolved), but I stopped taking it in late August because the hormones stressed me out, and it made my cramps even worse, even after trying various birth controls. I've been wanting to get back on it, for actually controlling of birth purposes (still a virgin by the definition of vaginal penetration, but don't know how much longer that status will apply), but have been waiting until I get my next period. But, who knows when that will be, as it's already been nearly three months since my last period. Again, this figure isn't particularly alarming--I'm used to being irregular, and *have* lost a fair amount of weight over these past three months.  

Anyway, to the point of my story. I was fingering myself in the shower, and pulled out my fingers to find a little bit of a really dark brown, almost black clumpy substance that in no way resembled blood. This is probably unrelated, but I had a bit of diarrhea right after I found it. I don't even know what it was, but my suspicion is the previous uterine lining--can anyone confirm this or have a similar story? Should I see a doctor about this?  

I moved from the United States to South Korea right before my last period, and am across the world from my gynecologist. I don't quite trust female healthcare here--sex education is overall very bad, and often hospitals use traditional oriental techniques intermixed with modern medicine.

My boyfriend's sex drive has decreased over the past few months. Although I love having sex with my boyfriend, and have missed it, it has definitely been harder for him to deal with. Lately though, he has started to completely disconnect from me. I try to be affectionate in a non sexual way and get nothing in return. He will barely even touch me anymore. We had a sit down a few nites ago and he explained that it's not just me, he is just not aroused by anything at this point. Of course it is stressing him out, and he says that I am a constant reminder that he is not ""holding up his end of the bargain"". At this point, the sex is the least of my worries. I'm feeling sad, neglected, and completely unloved.

Am I being selfish and crazy for having these feelings? Has anyone else gone through this same scenario? Unfortunately I have no girl friends to turn to who have been through this.

I just love him so much, and i just want to feel that same love from him. The sex I can wait for, that's not the issue. :(

EDIT: Did a little more research on common symptoms and side effects of low testosterone. He has already looked into making a doctors appointment so hopefully, if this is what's causing all of these symptoms, he should be back to himself in a few weeks.

&gt;The symptoms of low testosterone can also fool a guy because they are so ubiquitous.  By that I mean that testosterone affects EVERYTHING in the male. It affects our brain, our libido, our muscles, our blood - the list goes on and on. Of course, the number one thing in most guys' mind is how it affects their sex life.  Low testosterone affects both libido and erectile strength to varying degrees and that obviously isn't too good for the ol' sex life.

However, common symptoms also include depression, mental fogginess/fuzziness, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, loss of muscle, increased weight gain, decreased facial hair and a general feeling of not caring about anything.  **When you are low on testosterone, you often just don't care about anything - you just ""exist"".**  Pleasure and desire can be greatly decreased greatly affecting your career and your relationships.",,False,,t5_2uczz,1354306297.0,,,True,t3_141y59,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/141y59/boyfriends_low_sex_drive_feeling_neglected/,

On top of it, my feelings about him are really complicated right now. I want to hook up with him again, but I could also see myself dating him. BUT I also would hesitate to throw an even bigger wrench into our relationship as friends in the case that my feelings about him aren't reciprocated. While talking to a male friend about it, he said that the fact that this guy stuck around in the morning is evidence enough that something's there. But the skeptic in me isn't so sure.

I just don't know how to talk to him. We live about an hour apart and both work so it's tough to hang out in person. There are nights when I just want to pick up the phone and say, ""Hey, I really appreciate how you respected me and my boundaries. I had a lot of fun and would absolutely be up to more ""movie nights"" or variants of such, just say the word. Also, I very much enjoy your company and want to spend more time with you. Soooo...there.""

Any advice on how to approach this?

I was raised Catholic, and fell in with the over-abundance of shame and guilt with sexual feelings. Of course, when my husband and I were dating as teens, we fooled around a lot, enjoyed it, but never went all the way--not until several years later. So now we've been married over a year, been together for 13 years...and only had sex a handful of times. It's pathetic, really, but I have trouble getting my libido up enough to *want* PiV. My husband and I just had a really good talk about what we want for our second year of marriage, and it mostly involves getting better at sex.

So what I need is some resources for finding out what I like to get me riled up and ready for action. I'm dying for good recommendations for soft-core porn, erotica, and the like.

I really prefer reading sexy, steamy stuff, because it's easier to imagine me and my husband in the place of the characters. The one romance novel I have I've read a dozen times because I love the story, but I need more options. E-books would especially be great.

As soon as I get off I can't stand further penetration. It doesn't hurt or anything - it makes me feel very uncomfortable. After a minute or two everything is fine again and penetration feels good again.

The thing that concerns me is that this only happens when I orgasm with penetration. When he eats me out or stimulates me with his fingers and I orgasm I can go on immediately.

1364177433.0,19,self.TwoXSex,1ay6v2,Orgasmic anhedonia (physical orgasm but no pleasure): what do?!,sheevathediva,21,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/1ay6v2/orgasmic_anhedonia_physical_orgasm_but_no/,"Sorry for wall of text: felt it was important to mention details due to nature of problem! TL;DR available at the bottom.

Here it is: I think I'm able to orgasm. Whether during penetrative sex or by myself, physically, everything appears to work fine. I get hot, my breathing and heart rate speed up, the pressure starts to build, my arms and legs go rigid, and then finally there's a release and I feel contractions down there. Occasionally, I squirt.

The problem is, after the whole (quite pleasurable) build-up, I feel nothing. I mean, I *feel* the physical contractions and all the rest of it, but I don't feel any pleasure. No release, no warmth spreading upwards, no tingling, none of what so many women have described to me.

It just sort of goes flat. Because I feel a certain amount of pleasure during the build-up, I don't really mind (much). I still love having sex, it still feels great; I still get horny! Nevertheless, I'm clearly missing out, and that really sucks.

So I googled it, and it seems like I have orgasmic anhedonia (see [here](http://www.sexualmed.org/index.cfm/sexual-health-issues/for-women/orgasmic-anhedonia-pleasure-dissociative-orgasmic-disorder-pdod/overview/) for a more scientific explanation/description).

Now they mention that one of the common reasons for this is depression. 

Here's a bit of my sexual and mental history, for reference:

* I only became sexually active (eg: had sex) when I was 18, and I was quite depressed at the time (unhappy, lonely, hated my uni course and had no clue where my life was going: ended up eating a lot/not at all and crying/sleeping all the time). 

* I changed course and moved away, thought/felt I was better/fine/great for about 6-8 months (although this ""condition"" continued), then I was raped. 

* I got a boyfriend about a month later (who was lovely and caring), started taking the combined pill and having regular ""good"" sex. 

* After about 5 months later, my libido disappeared (like, overnight).
 
* I became very depressed approx. 4 months later: went to counselling for a few months, took Zoloft (an SSRI) for about three months. 

* I stopped taking the pill in february, as well as the SSRI, post breaking up with said boyfriend; I stopped taking them because I was feeling a lot better. I also stopped counselling because my uni only offers a certain number of sessions- I haven't gotten around to finding another counsellor.

* My libido has come back full force, but this condition still remains.

So maybe it has to do with my depression? As long as I can remember, I've been a horny individual, even as a kid. I just can't remember ever feeling an intense pleasurable release.

Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope? Is there some way to get over it? This is so frustrating and upsetting, and I just can't believe I might be one of the unlucky people who never gets to experience the pleasure of an orgasm.

TL;DR: Can orgasm but do not feel any pleasurable release. Appears to be ""orgasmic anhedonia"". May be linked to history of depression. What do?!",,False,,t5_2uczz,False,,,True,t3_1ay6v2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/1ay6v2/orgasmic_anhedonia_physical_orgasm_but_no/,

I guess the purpose of this post is two-fold -- one, just wondering if this is the case for anyone else? Is it common to squirt without g-spot stimulation?

Clitoral orgasm is very easy for me to reach, even multiple times. These days, I usually watch porn with asian amateurs, defloration porn, or hentai involving innocent girls. I'm asian myself, and I feel like I watch asian amateur porn because it most closely resembles the sex I have and enjoy. I also read stories on the above topics or on the rare occasion, I simply imagine similar situations in my head. Usually, when I orgasm, I think of my boyfriend and how good it feels when he's inside me.

However, for some reason, I have an almost impossible time reaching orgasm in front of my current boyfriend and have had the same issue with past boyfriends. My last boyfriend brought me to orgasm twice in 9 months, and my current boyfriend tries VERY hard, touching me exactly the way I tell him I like it. I get incredibly close, reaching that exponentially increasing point of pleasure that tells me I'm about to orgasm, but I just can't get over the hill. I've also discovered that I find it difficult to bring myself to orgasm when he's next to me, just enjoying the experience.

I've tried fantasizing about the things I normally think about when I masturbate, but I'm brought back to reality too often (I'll switch from fantasizing to thinking about how I love the way he's touching me). Sometimes if I focus really hard on a fantasy when I'm about to peak, I get even closer, but I'm still unsuccessful. I'd also prefer to orgasm without having to fantasize and just through my experience with my partner.

And it's also not that he doesn't turn me on. Merely seeing his shoulders or touching his erection can get me very turned on, and I'll start getting wet thinking about him inside me and how great it feels.

He's a cool guy and I enjoy spending time with him. The sex itself was amazing, even if we were a bit drunk, and we had sex again in the morning (he stayed over). He also initiated spooning a couple times as well. I didn't want to initiate it since I wasn't sure whether that would be too intimate for a hook up. 

I guess what I came to realize afterwards is that I couldn't hook up with him again, because I know for sure that I would fall for him. I mean, I've already got a teensy crush on him just because I think we get along fairly well, and I find him incredibly interesting and attractive.

I've been dating my current boyfriend (also 19) for about a year now and we've been having pretty consistent, lovely sex. I went on the birth control pill a few months ago and, after a bit, we felt comfortable having sex sans condom, but I would always ask that he pull out and finish on me or in my mouth. 

I've gotten kind of used to him either wearing a condom or pulling out now, but we both want for him to finish inside me. I just can't do it, though. I know the birth control pill is very effective, but I almost can't convince myself of it. It's hard to put so much faith in a small pack of pills. 

We have as of yet been unable to get to a point where he can finish inside me. Whenever he's about to come, part of me just rushes back to eighth grade health class and goes *You will get pregnant and die!* So I tense up and have to ask him to stop. 

Anyone else have similar experiences? How can I make myself feel comfortable enough to let him finish in me?

The story is about a woman explorer who discovers alien life in the form of a mysterious penis-shaped creature.

...It actually wasn't as bad of a story as it sounds, but there was one line that struck me as incredibly cringe-worthy: “it [the alien] resembled the human male reproductive structure so intimately that she could not repress a fleeting arousal reflex whenever she saw it for the first time that day.”

I immediately was bemused by that line and assumed that this author must know nothing about how women work, since *obviously* it's not just the penis that creates arousal, but also the appearance of the rest of the body, not to mention other aspects like personality. But then I thought, maybe some women are lucky enough to be able to experience arousal from seeing a penis alone. For me personally, though, a disembodied penis would just creep me the hell out. 

I guess what I'm asking is, do you think this line is a sign of bad writing/a poor understanding of how arousal in women works? Or am I just overreacting to this little piece of a story?

Why does sex hurt SO BAD?",angryspring,23,5,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/1e830c/really_need_some_advice_ive_googled_this_asked/,"I am so frustrated.

I like this guy so much, I want to have sex with him badly, and I'm very comfortable with him. I don't have a problem with dryness, at least I don't think so. I can insert four fingers in myself comfortably when I'm wet. I can also use large tampons comfortably.

He is seven inches, maybe a little more. And he's pretty thick. I myself am a girl of 5'2. 

Whenever he inserts the head of his penis it kind of hurts... but I can deal. As soon as he starts pushing more though, it... it really hurts. I would describe the sensation as... 'trying to break a wall.' So it feels like hes trying to penetrate through something... I doubt it's my hymen. Otherwise, why would I be able to insert a tampon?

He says that when he's inside me and trying to penetrate me, he can enter, but he doesn't because I'm in so much pain. I'm very confused by this- why does it feel like something's blocking his penis if he feels that he can push through easily? 

Is it the angle? Am I not wide enough? I can fit the head... Am I not wet enough? I seem to have adequate amounts of lubrication because when I'm with him, the wetness really comes out... We even use a water based lubricant for additional measure. I've asked other girls, browsed r/sex posts (especially the one for the first time). I've been especially confused because around 50% of girls I've talked to said their first time hurt, others say it didn't. R/sex seems to have the general consensus that it shouldn't hurt the first time.

Is my pain tolerance low? Should he just shove it in? Some girls have advised me to just grit my teeth and that it'll feel good once the pain is over. I've also read that advice on forums and things. It's not like I'm nervous- I really do want to have sex. However, we've tried to have sex around... 8 times now? And it's the same damn story every time. By now, I've been a little nervous of the pain... but before I never was. 

I just want to be able to enjoy sex. Can some ladies give me opinions? I'm also thinking of crossposting this to /r/sex just for additional measure. I really need help. 

tl;dr: I can fit the head of his penis. Anything after is pretty painful. I would describe the sensation as the penis trying to penetrate something that won't breach, I guess. I have enough lubrication. I have no qualms about sex so there's no psychological disparity that is making me nervous... what gives?

This becomes increasingly embarrassing and hard to explain over time to new partners that they can't take off my shirt. I have really terrible stretch marks all over my back, shoulders, and stomach, even though I've never been pregnant -- or fat.

I hate the way my skin looks. These scars will never leave my body and they haven't gotten better (it's been about ten years since I started getting them during puberty). They are very white and noticeable since they are completely covering my tummy especially.

Our sex life is pretty great in a lot of ways, but it's nearly always focused on oral. PIV tends to be pretty uncomfortable for me, to the point where I can barely stand it unless I'm getting a LOT of clitoral stimulation at the same time to distract from the penetration, and it's hard to keep that up for long periods. (Yes, we follow the usual advice - lots and lots of foreplay, lube, etc.)

I don't think this is vaginismus - the sensation doesn't really feel like the descriptions of vaginismus I've read (it's more...sort of intensely achey than knifelike), and I can get something like a finger in there with no trouble at all (anything close to the size of an erect penis is usually trouble, though). However, I have had a couple of gynecologists mention that my vaginal canal is a little hard to navigate because it's more slanted toward my back than usual. I suspect it's mostly the angle that's causing the problems.

FWIW, the positions that seem to work best are ones where we're roughly perpendicular to each other, either cowgirl (pretty comfortable for me, but it's hard to get enough up-and-down action to be fun for him while still stimulating my clit) or doggy-style with me crouched on the edge of the bed and him standing up (better for him, doable but less fun for me - also it nearly always involves a lot of queefing afterward, I don't know how normal that is).

He was my first, but I was not his. He knows way more than I do about this whole ""sex"" thing. I enjoy it a lot, I do - but when he asks me what I enjoy specifically, I totally draw a blank. I mean, I know what feels good as it's happening, but going back even just a few minutes later and trying to figure out just what positions or just what movements were better is really difficult. 

In addition, sometimes while we're going at it, he will slow down and ask what I want: do I want to rearrange, am I comfortable, different position, etc. Again, though, very rarely am I like, ""Yes! I want this to happen"" and I sort of let him keep the reigns, and I feel like it leaves him in the dark even though he's trying very hard to please me. We're really open about everything and have sort of talked about this, about how I just can't recall what specific motions I like, and I have a difficult time voicing desires. 

Honestly, I'm just very shy sexually and am having some issues with confronting my sexuality, which has only in the last six months even showed its face. How do I overcome this?

Or just sympathy?,KTcube,23,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/16uij3/i_have_lots_of_issues_advice_or_just_sympathy/,"Background: I've been with my boyfriend for a little over a year.

1. I have no idea what I want out of sex other than what my boyfriend wants. I've tried masturbating and watching porn to try and figure out what turns me on, but there isn't really any sex practice that seems better than any other ones.

2. My boyfriend does all the initiating of sex. He wants me to start sex sometimes, but it takes me hours to work up the courage to do it and by that time he's just gotten impatient and started it for me. This is partly because I can't think of anything to do (see number 1) and partly because the one thing in the world I can't stand is asking other people to do things when I'm not in a position of authority. Since there is no authority in this relationship I feel like I can't take control.

3. I don't like to talk unless someone is asking me a question or I'm directing a group. I guess this is just a general life problem.

4. My boyfriend wants me to ""improvise"" more during sex. I guess he's just kind of tired of being the one who makes all the decisions. He said that I seem to know what to do if it's something we've done before, but he feels like I'm always looking for a script. So, how can I be more spontaneous?

Whenever he does want sex (which is way less often than he used to), I basically jump at the chance because I'm already dying of sexual frustration. 

When we do have sex, I'm lucky to get any foreplay, and if I don't finish before he does, forget about it. I just went on the pill, and now that he can actually finish inside me, I NEVER finish first. I can't even remember the last time he actually gave me an orgasm. I try not to be selfish and have always considered myself a giving lover. I'm on anti-depressants and am not always the easiest nut to crack, but neither is he. I'm sick of giving him 45 minute blowjobs and getting nothing back. 

I don't know if I'm coming off as too aggressive, and that's turning him off, or if he's not interested in me sexually anymore. I have gained weight recently, but he hasn't said anything negative about it.

I've tried to bring this up with him, talking about wanting more foreplay, asking for oral sex, but all I get from him are promises and no actual results.

I was diagnosed with vulvodynia, chronic vulvar pain. I tried to treat it, primarily with physical therapy, for years, until I finally tried going off the pill last fall. (Hormonal birth control is associated with vulvodynia). It has decreased the pain somewhat, although that could also be due to finally finding a good physical therapist.

The first few months were OK, then I started missing periods this spring/summer. I went back to my gynecologist and got bloodwork done, given my history. I definitely have PCOS this time, no ambiguity. I have insulin resistance and high testosterone. I've always had a decent amount of facial and body hair for a girl, and it's definitely gotten worse over the past several months.

So here's my problem. Yasmin (which my current gynecologist recommended over Yaz) would likely help prevent future pain from cysts, at least keep the hair from getting even worse than it already is, and make my periods less miserable. It would also probably slow or reverse progress on treating my vulvodynia, which breaks my heart. I'm 26 and I've never been able to have penetrative sex, and I'm terrified that I never will.

I prefer to be a little submissive in the bedroom, and I'm afraid that when we go to have sex it'll be a lot of giving instructions and like trying to teach someone how to parallel park. ಠ_ಠ

Should this bother me? We've mildly discussed it and it's been an issue due to the fact that I feel incompetent as a partner to him, that I must not be sexually satisfying him if he needs to continually masturbate.

We have a very healthy sex life, and for me this only contributes to the fact I feel his masturbation has a negative effect on my sexual confidence in the relationship.

I realize that this may be MY issue to over-come, I've told him that it's not something he needs to feel bad about, however I cannot shake this uncomfortable feeling I get upon discovering he's snuck away in the middle of the night to jerk of in comparison to waking me up to fool around instead.

What should I do? Is there something I can do to overcome this feeling so this is no longer an issue?

So there are a few things I have questions about: 

1. Blowjobs: considering our living situations, we're pretty much limited to his room for sexytime stuff, making hand jobs a little more complicated, so we bought flavoured condoms to try blowjobs... Problem is, I have a very strong gag reflex, so I can't go very deep, or even hold him in my mouth very long. Lately, we've been just using the flavoured condoms for handjobs, since I can't get him off with my mouth, partly because he says he can't feel much I do with my mouth, and if I manage to do something well, I can't go very long, so its frustrating. Any tips? Should we just stick to hands?

2. Sex: we've had sex a few times now, the first couple with him on top, which felt good, but would have taken a really long time for me to finish, and he's still working on longevity. We've also tried me on top a couple times, since that's what works better with clothes on, but the movements are all different, and I have a hard time moving without hurting either him or myself. I know this is all about practise, but I was hoping you'd have some tips to make this feel better for me, since he has no problem at all coming from sex, and I'd like to as well.

3. Condoms: this wasn't a problem with him on top, so maybe its because of angle, but when I'm on top, or when he's laying down and I give him a hand job in a condom, I've noticed that some of his stuff leaks out the top of the condom and sits at the base of his penis. Why does this happen, and how can we stop it? Its very worrying to finish sex like that. He's circumcized, does that make any difference? Are we doing something wrong?

My problem is, that I'll get really close, but then plateau. Manual clit stimulation will feel really, really good for a while, but then I have to tell my partner to stop, because (I can't really describe it), it almost feels too good and idk, my body wants it, but my brain puts on the brakes. 

Doggy style has also produced the same effect: I feel like something's building up, but I can never reach the peak. It always feels like I have to pee (even when I don't), which makes me think I'm close, but I'm not sure. Part of me thinks that it's mental: i'm afraid to orgasm for some reason because I'm afraid of the noises and faces I'll make, or if I'll squirt. I also have to actively stop feeling self-conscious during sex. My partner always feeling bad after another failed attempt at orgasm doesn't help either. I try to tell him that everything still feels amazing and it's not him, but I don't think he gets it.

I've been having sex with my first partner for over a year. We both really love it. However, I'm still struggling with an issue-- in pretty much every position we try, it feels really awesome but after a few minutes (I've never timed it but I'm guessing 5-7ish), it starts to hurt and I just want it to be over as soon as possible. We've tried taking a break and putting on more lube but once the soreness starts, I'm pretty much done. 

It's extremely frustrating. I just hate that basically every time we have sex, I need to ask him to come soon and I can tell he's kind of disappointed because obviously he wants to keep going and also not be hurting me.

Does anyone else have this problem or any possible solutions? If you don't mind answering, how long does actual sex usually last for you guys?

I ended up having a one night stand with a friend.  We used protection but he did finger me a lot.  I woke up the next morning with a sore vagina/vulva area and did not think much about it besides bathing and not touching it.

That was about seven days ago and now I'm experiencing an unbelievably itchy upper vulva area.  The clit hood and surrounding area is so itchy.  I went to the ob/gyn and she told me that I may have mild dermatitis or a small yeast infection and to put cortisone cream on it.

So I did, and it's been almost seven days and it still won't go away.  I'm extremely frustrated and at a loss for this situation because I don't know what to do.  I've taken three vinegar baths and they have done nothing.  I've also stopped using soap and keeping myself in my room without pants on to let things air out down there.  Nothing has helped and I am close to tears I don't feel like my docter took anything I said seriously and I cannot stand how itchy it is.

Does anyone have any similar experiences with this?

Before I can really ask that, I suppose I should give a little orgasmic background.... Lot of personal information here. Warning has been announced. :)

I have been capable of orgasm since I was around 4 or 5 years old. From that point on, until I was 16 or 17 I could have multiple orgasms. I could orgasm, wait thirty seconds, have a go around, and orgasm again. I could pretty much continue the cycle of orgasms as long as I wanted to. 3 to 6 orgasms was pretty standard. Also, I have only ever been able to orgasm via clitoral stimulation. Then it seemed like overnight, they changed.

 I have NO ideas, or suspicions as to why it happened, or how it happened so quickly, but all of a sudden my orgasms came one at a time and that was that. I would orgasm, and be done with it. And not only did I feel spent, my clit became so sensitive to the touch that it was downright uncomfortable, and I had a difficult time trying to force myself to come to orgasm again. I am 28 now, and I've been stuck ever since.

So here is my question, worded a little differently. I am sad that my orgasms have become more like that of a male, and I miss the freedom, and fun of being able to orgasm whenever I feel like it.

I'm in a bit of a pickle and I was wondering if any of you had any advice. 

About three years ago I got the Mirena IUD, and I love it to death! Besides being one of the most effective methods of birth control (an absolute must as I don't want kids), it's almost entirely eliminated my periods. Before they were gone I didn't even realize how miserable having a period made me: I didn't get horrible cramps or anything like I know some ladies do, but I felt *terrible* nonetheless. I felt worthless and disgusting, and I couldn't help but think about how my male friends and colleagues didn't have to put up with the mess, the inconvenience, etc. It really made me feel like less of a person. When I got my IUD and the periods stopped, I felt like such a huge weight was lifted off of me.

However, the IUD has also wrecked my libido. I still want sex, but not like I did before, and not with the kind of frequency needed to sustain a relationship. (It's already killed one relationship, and may be on it's way to killing another...)

I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place. Do I give up the Mirena and go back to having a normal sex life, but have to feel... almost *inhuman* one week a month?

I am in a LDR with my boyfriend. We see each other every 2 to 4 months. Of course when we meet we are very horny and have sex as soon as we arrive either at his or at my place. I get very wet and all, but as soon as he goes into me my vagina starts hurting on the outside, I don't know how to explain this but I guess it's like a spot towards my butt that his penis touches when he's trying to enter me. It's a bit different every time, and it took me a while to understand the pain was outside. Last time we met it didn't hurt much, but the time before that it hurt really bad for at least one week.

This is the biggest problem: the pain won't go away for a couple of days to a week, but those are of course the days when we are having sex the most (because we just met and missed each other, you don't need me to explain). I can still enjoy the sex as soon as he's fully in, but it hurts when he's trying to get inside me. I try relaxing as much as possible but sometimes I can't do that because I know it's gonna hurt (even for just a few seconds) and it's a vicious circle.

I'm not too worried, but sometimes when the pain was really really bad (and I happened to notice that that happens when we meet after not seeing each other for more than average the usual time) and we were having sex I was enjoying it only for some time, and then I started getting a bit dryer because of friction, which wouldn't normally hurt, but because of that ""spot"" it hurts so bad that I just start wishing he would finish and eventually when I can't take it anymore I ask him to stop. 

I just want to say he knows all of this, we talked about it and he does his best not to hurt me, but it's not his fault. It's really not too much of a problem (of course, if we only see each other for a couple of days it can be annoying), but I'm just wondering if this is normal and if any of you can relate to this. I may also need to add that when we aren't with each other I don't use a vibrator or anything that goes inside me.

I hope I'm in the right subreddit.

As the title suggests, I would like to buy some lingerie online but I am worried that when it arrives it won't fit so well. I know how to take measurements and I know that there are size charts on the websites, but lingerie seems trickier... 

For example, you can buy a chemise with underwire and shaped cups but the sizes are S/M/L instead of 36D or whatever. Then you look at the size chart, and S means bust measurement for (some range of measurements) and cup size for A/B/C.

Other notes:

* I'm small busted.

* Let's assume that I *can't* return the item easily.

* I'm looking at chemises/babydolls and corsets.

* (If you have tips on other types of lingerie please post that too. Other people might be looking for similar advice.)

So my question: is it difficult to buy lingerie without trying it on? Is it a problem if I'm a little on the small side? Do you have advice for how to more accurately select the size? (besides taking bust/hip/waist measurements and checking the store's sizing chart)

Basically, when I was 19 I was diagnosed with HPV. On the outside.

But I really trusted who I had slept with and for all I know it could have been back from HS. Anyway, just a couple months ago I had a cyst the size of a grapefruit on one of my ovaries that I had to have surgery to get removed and now two months later I havent gotten my period and I have to call my doctor monday and figure out if he wants me to just start my birth control or if he wants to look at me and make sure everythings all right...

My bf has been incredibly supportive. I love him to death and I love to make him happy in bed, but I havent been able to reach climax because im scared of sex hurting, scared of something else coming up.

My boyfriend and I have a wonderful sex life.  He is affectionate, knows my body well, and hits all of the right spots at the right time.  Despite that he’s by far the most compatible partner I’ve ever had, my libido is seemingly insatiable.  

I know on the outside this may not seem like a real problem.  Some of my male friends jokingly state that they wish they had the same issue with their partners.  On the contrary, my boyfriend feels like he’s not satisfying me adequately and I feel like a selfish, sex-crazed jerk.  We’re both very open and honest with each other, so we are aware of our differences and try our best to meet in the middle.  

Lately, I’ve been dealing with some depression and I can’t help but feel unattractive when my SO doesn’t instigate sex as often as I do.  I realize this is partly because he doesn’t always have a fair opportunity to be the instigator, but I do worry that my high sex drive is frustrating him.  Furthermore, I fear that his sex-esteem will start to suffer if it hasn't already. 

Do any of you have a similar dynamic?  If so, how do you manage it? I masturbate frequently and I try to keep things reasonable, but any other suggestions are welcomed.

TL;DR: I have a higher sex-drive than my boyfriend and it’s making me feel guilty. ",,False,,t5_2uczz,False,,,True,t3_vnejy,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/vnejy/lady_libido/,

A week later, I was having frequent urination and after a urinalysis/culture, she said it was a UTI. Got on antibiotics for that. In the mean time, I had my annual well woman's exam and got a complete check. There wasn't any burning, itching or frequent urination. I thought I was good! 

I then tried having sex with my boyfriend and it burned like crazy. Figuring I needed some time off, we tried again a week later and it was still burning. I went to Planned Parenthood since my own OBGYN couldn't fit me in for five weeks and after doing a wet mount (inserting the speculum was insanely painful), she said it was BV. I got on antibiotics for that but a week later, I'm still having burning. And itching. 

I'm currently treating it as a yeast infection because of the itching (which has now gone away). The burning is still there and is annoying as ever.

**TLDR:** Sex drive has rapidly decreased, boyfriend and I are frustrated, not sure what the cause is. Please help.


I'm 20/F, living with my 20/M boyfriend and his family for the summer. We met and started dating in college. During school sex was very frequent and convenient since neither of us had roommates. But this summer, living with his family has made finding sexy time really difficult. We are sleeping in different rooms so as to not set a bad example for his little brother, and neither of us are willing to risk sex unless we have the house completely empty. 

Throughout the summer, my sex drive has gradually decreased to where now even if we have the house to ourselves, I can't get myself in the mood. He can't get me in the mood. No matter how hard we try. It's really frustrating for me and I know he's increibly frustrated too. I need some help, ladies. I'm not sure what I can do, and I want the last month of summer to be amazing for us since I'm studying abroad soon and won't see him for almost a year. I've thought of a few possible things that could be lowering my sex drive:


* **Tired.** I've been working nearly every day this summer, and days I don't work I'm usually at the gym for 3+ hours. A lot of times I'm physically exhausted and this could make me not want to have sex.

* **Not attracted to him.** I don't know how to talk to my boyfriend about this without coming off as really superficial, but it's true. I'm just not attracted to his body. I've been asking him to come to the gym with me every day I go, but he never wants to come. He's super skinny and its hard for me to be aroused by his body. I know I shouldn't be comparing him against other people, but when I spend time with attractive, muscular guys at the gym, it's really hard for me to come home and feel sexually attracted to him. I have no idea how to bring this up without really hurting his self esteem. 


* **Feeling too pressured.** We have a very limited amount of time to have sex and it makes me feel like there's a ton of pressure on me. I have to get horny as soon as possible before the parents get home or else we'll have to stop in the middle of everything. But the thing is, I *can't* make myself get horny super quickly. It has to be a gradual thing for me. When my boyfriend runs into my room excitedly saying ""my parents just left! Let's hurry."" I feel like there's so much pressure for me to get horny as fast as possible, and if I can't then I feel like I've let both of us down.


* **Bored.** When we do have sex, the process has become way too routine for me. Lay in bed, cuddle, make out, undress, touch, sex (shower, rinse, repeat). I really enjoy spontaneity. I've tried to communicate this to my boyfriend but he doesn't understand. He asks, ""well, what do you want to try then?"". I don't know! I just want something *different*. I'm not saying I want to try anal or BDSM, but I just want to change things up. Spontaneity/excitement has been a past problem in our non-sexual relationship as well. He's very okay with things being the exact same way every single day but I am not. When he tries to be spontaneous or exciting I feel like he's trying way too hard and it makes me feel less turned on. 

Although my boyfriend has been understanding of this (hasn't tried to pressure me into sex when I'm not in the mood), I can tell he's really frustrated and let down when this happens. Not sure if it matters, but I've been on the pill for 6 months or so, and it hasn't affected my sex drive in the past. 

TwoXSex, please help me. I could use any advice you have to offer. A lot of these things are out of my control, but I think learning how to communicate my sexual needs to my boyfriend could help a lot.

I was also curious if anyone else had an experience like mine. Sorry for the novel...

This is really hard to write, but I'm not enjoying sex right now the way I wish I was. And I frankly don't know how to fix it, or that there are so many issues contributing to the problem that I don't know where to start. (for anyone wondering, I am a 19 year old female) This always hits home when I read people's accounts of how wonderful sex is, or how relaxed and happy they sound. I always start crying because I wish I had what they did. 

I am currently with my boyfriend of over 2 1/2 years, we are each other's first relationship, and first sexual partners. Obviously, we still have no idea what we're doing. He is the love of my life, and I could not be in a happier relationship. In essence, we are both very very happy.

But... I don't feel like I enjoy sex as much as I should/could, or as much as he does. I really really want to, because it is wonderful intimate time with him that I'd love to enjoy. Please don't get me wrong, I find him incredibly attractive, and I love him to bits. Thinking it over, I think there are several issues.

First, I have been raised in a very anti-sex household, and all the scare tactics they use in health class scared me so badly I think I'm having issues getting over them. My mother is aware that we are sexually active and I am on birth control, but I can't help feeling incredibly guilty about it. I honestly can't quite put my finger on why. The whole ""if you have sex, you're incredibly bad and are going to ruin your life"" talk runs through my head every time things begin. It makes it difficult to feel sexy or attractive, and even when I do, I feel bad for thinking that way. He kisses my neck, not even in a sexual environment, I'll love it, love him, want him, and then feel bad... Even talking about is challenging sometimes, but... I still love it, even with all that going through my head.

Second, I am so absolutely TERRIFIED of getting pregnant that I for the life of me, cannot relax enough to enjoy what's happening. I'm scared even if it's not PIV sex, like for example, if he goes on my chest. I'll avoid touching the area for over a day, like I'm afraid they're going to cling to my hands and jump off when I use the restroom. XD I'm aware of how silly this is. I know sperm don't jump. I'm on birth control, we use condoms as well (even though he wants to go inside me with nothing in the way... which is... hard to even think about) I just don't know how to go about calming down those inner voices of fear.

Finally, I think all those fears running through my head are keeping my body from doing what it wants to do. I'll become aroused and I'm able to become wet. But... maybe it's because I'm not communicative enough (in fact, I'm sure I'm not because I feel so guilty talking about it in the first place) but he doesn't always do things that feel good. He cares so much, and tries so hard, but it usually ends up hurting or feeling too strong. I know it's cliche, but I just feel a bit broken. The thing is, even if I tried being more communicative, I don't know what on earth I'd tell him. I have NO idea what would feel good or what he should do. I realize that it's just part of the process of figuring each other out, but I feel like SOMETHING should have felt good by now... right? Obviously, the only time I've been able to go is through helping myself out, but really, I'd love it if he could do it instead. He'd love it, I'd love it.

I guess I'm just a little overwhelmed. It's difficult fighting through your metal blocks. I do have a wonderfully supportive partner in my SO, but I don't really have anyone else to talk to these things about with. Another opinion or point of view would just be interesting. Maybe someone else out there knows how I feel, or has, and has a solution or something to say.

I'm having a bit of a struggle, and hope I might be able to get some advice from you all. I want to preface that I am in counseling, but counselors don't typically give advice so here I am. I have a feeling I know where my difficulties in saying ""no"" come from, and I'm working on them. 

Background: I've been with my SO for eight years, we met when I was in college and he was finishing law school, seven years between us. For a very long time the relationship was great - we enjoyed spending time together, my face lit up every time he called, he has supported me through major health issues. In the spring of 2012 he took a job across the country (and three time zones). Things have been really rocky since. I screwed up all my courage and told him how unhappy I have been. We are still best friends but the passion is gone. I think we could rekindle it, but its going to take a lot of work. He agreed. I set two provisions under which I would be willing to do the heavy lifting of putting us back together: he needed to give me a definitive answer regarding children/marriage (why should I work so hard if we aren't on the same page?), and that when he moves back to our area his primary residence will be with me. (He lives with his parents, its cultural. He had asked me to move in part time when he visits the area back in December but it was all talk.) I gave him 15 days to make the decision (he wouldn't without a deadline). He ""thought the date was (15 days later)"", but gave me an answer (yes) to the first question, I'm still waiting for his answer on living together. In the meantime we agreed to date other people (open relationship) until he moves home more permanently. In part, he feels like we haven't dated enough other people to be sure this is the happiest we can be. So, for the first time in my life as a serial monogamist, I'm dating. In the 14 years since I started dating, I've been single about eight months. This is where I need some advice. 


I've been on two dates with two men, and things went much farther sexually than I had wanted in both incidences. I was interested in kissing, maybe some light petting, but ended up having piv sex in both cases. In the first case I said no, we shouldn't because he has a girlfriend (entirely different issue, yes), but things continued to move forward. It wasn't so much I didn't want to, but felt we shouldn't. I felt okay about it afterwards, he is a nice guy and we still talk but aren't dating. I went on my second date last night with a guy I met on a dating website. I made abundantly clear that we would not be having sex, but we could kiss, trying to prevent a repeat of before. So we went for a walk in my neighborhood (mistake one), and I let him come in to my apartment for a snack (mistake two). He kept pushing me and I said no, multiple times. Biologically I was interested and enjoyed it, but emotionally I was *not* ready. I will be having a discussion with this man to let him know this was not okay. I've identified two things I can do better (mistakes one and two), but would really appreciate some advice on making my ""no"" clearer. I'm going to take my self off the dating website until I can get this issue a bit more under control. 

I really appreciate any help you can give me. I'm feeling really sad and powerless about this whole situation, and can't talk to my family/friends about this. 

**tl;dr:** I'm a serial monogamist dating for the first time, both dates were more sexual than I wanted. How can I make my ""no"" clearer?

I'm the proud mother of a wonderful 5-month-old son.

Since he has been born, and also some time before, I have not masturbated one time. Occasionally we have sex, and about 2/3 of those times I get really turned on during the act, but I've essentially lost my sex drive.

Now, on some days (like today), I wake up and find myself horny like a thousand rabbits. But inevitably, my son is lying next to me, mostly awake, and I think it would be just wrong to start pleasuring myself. 

Richt now he lies on his blanket next to me, sleeping, but it's not like I could whip up some eye candy and start. I would think it's wrong and disgusting to have some NSFW material on my laptop while he might wake up any second. Same goes for fingering my genitals. 

I can also not just put him in his bed and, for instance, go showering in peace because I already have very rare and limited timeframes of showering that I can barely use to clean myself thoroughly.

So most of the time I end up thinking ""It's ok, I don't need to masturbate anyway"", but of course stay horny.

I'm considered really high functioning by the types that like to stick people in tiny tiny boxes, in that I am really smart, I'm able to handle most emotional processing well, and can mostly function.. but I've got two huge problems that this feeds into. 

One is trying to find that special someone.. That would be great and all, but the other problem is much more immediate. 

I am just desperate for intimate contact. Or to put it really really bluntly... I ***need*** sex. 

I'm amazed by this on so many levels. I've never run across a narrative of another girl like me getting this way; almost always, the libido decreases and morphs. Make no mistake; it's morphed; it's just gone from dead stop to Mach 5! If it's the hormones, then my body really needed to up the estrogen and null the testosterone, because my last labs showed that they're at female levels. 

I know the science behind it, I know the rationale.. but damn it. I'm on edge every waking moment, and half the moments I'm asleep. I'm lucky that I have some serious hardcore mental discipline so I can function for the time that I'm working; but when I'm off the clock, and that pressure cooker releases.. or worse, someone comes into my perception that strikes me the right way...?! I nearly lose it. And, gods help me if that person actually shows any kind of interest in me. 

Let's get the obvious out of the way; forget any ideas about being able to get my rocks off the way that boys do, despite still having.. OEM equipment. I'm trying hard to rediscover my body, maybe figure out *something* I can do to turn the heat down for a little bit. 

Because this is almost as crippling as being in agonizing pain. At least in pain, there are pills that theoretically can dull the sensations for most people. (I know some people may not like the analogy.. but for half of last year, I was in such pain.. and from where I'm sitting, it's apt. And, lucky me, those kinds of meds have limited efficacy on me too.) 

I need advice, I need suggestions, I need help. 

**edit: I'm not looking to cyber, or phone, or skype, or any other kind of virtual-sex. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; Creepers, please please please don't ask for such. I'm trying to get help in, well, figure out how to just get off until I can get someone else in my life.**

***Update. I've been able.. to at least get some temporarily relief. It did require a bubble Epsom salt bath, two vibrators.. but at then I learned a few things. One, oh my blessed deities if someone caresses my ears... or my cheeks... or my neck... Exploring, very good suggestion. Two.. I've become multiorgasmic. WOW. Fireworks going off in my head. I can see infrared and ultraviolet and everything else has the intensity raised to fifteen.. and if I was n't bathing, my legs would've turned to Silly Putty. (They're already two parts Silly Putty... I'm hypermobile.. but once I'm with someone? We is gonna have fun with.. the permanently-affixed dildo.*** *(Well, when it doesn't turn into a limp noodle following one sexcapade.. it's a strap-on that I don't need to have a harness to employ.)* ***I still have the flames of desire and libido raging inside me. I could spend the entire night going at it, but all I'd have to show for it would be a sleepless night, probably another ten orgasms (!!!!!!) and the inability to stand up.. and probably some fresh knickers. But I think.. I hope.. it's enough for a few days.. I hope I hope I hope...***

So I'm not sure where to ask this, but I figure this subreddit is the most relevant to lady part problems. 

When I was very young, and nearing my first period, I would get yeast infections, especially because I was exploring, down there. I remember what the itching and burning was like, and have not experienced it since then, until recently. 

I get chronic UTIs, and my doctor has prescribed me antibiotics to take occasionally to prevent them. Along with good hygiene and lots of water intake, I've been pretty successful at keeping them at bay for the past 2 years with the help of the antibiotics. I usually only get them if I've had sex, and have never had issues with UTIs before I was sexually active. I am also on the pill (Ortho tri-cyclen lo), and I read online that yeast infections can arise from hormonal changes as well as excessive antibiotic use. I was always cautious, but I figured I would be ok since I've gone this long on both the pill and antibiotic use, and am only now encountering the problem.

The vaguely familiar itching of my vulva area started to arise, a sensation I hadn't felt in a while. I decided to get one of those test kits to confirm, and proceeded to take anti-fungal cream (Monistat 3-day) to clear the infection. All was well for about 5 days, but now I'm starting to feel the effects again. Slightly itchy/tickly down there, and the discharge is white and starting to look like cottage cheese again. 

I'm going to the doctor in two days for a physical anyway, so I'll try to make it without taking any medication to make sure this is indeed a yeast infection. 

With all that being said, do you ladies have any tips? Is this something I will be experiencing from now on? Also, my period will be in a few days, will that clear it up? Your guys' opinions are so great, and I appreciate the help.

He occasionally had *a little bit* of difficulty getting or maintaining an erection during the beginning of our relationship but the issue has become more pronounced as time goes on. Now almost every time we attempt PiV sex he goes soft at some point.

About a month ago he was on a 3-month stay in the next town for work and was only able to come back once a week or once every other week, which meant we weren't having sex as often. He had difficulty lasting as long but didn't have problems staying hard at all. However our sex was still unsatisfying for me a lot of the time because he wouldn't initiate or do foreplay. I talked to him about this, but perhaps not as nicely as I should've, because he seemed disheartened. That area of our sex life has improved, but I'm worried I damaged his sexual confidence.

He tries to push towards manual and oral stimulation a lot to take the pressure off himself, which is great and everything. I hate to complain about this because he's better with his fingers and tongue than any guy I've been with before. (I've messed around with 4 partners including him and only had PiV sex with two.) But I really prefer the physical sensation and feeling of intimacy I get from PiV and other types of sex just aren't quite as satisfying. I've started to notice myself losing interest in sex because we're not having the type of sex I really want to have, and I've even stopped masturbating as often.

He eats fairly healthy, is in decent shape (he just started going to the gym again recently) and has a healthy sex drive in spite of this problem. From his account, he masturbates every day when he doesn't see me with the aid of porn. I also have to contemplate the possibility that this problem is caused by my needing to lose weight. I'm 5'6"" 136 lbs, so I'm not medically overweight but I am very conscious of the fact that I'm carrying more fat than most women I see my age.

Anyone else who's faced similar problems have any insight to lend?

**EDIT**: Thanks for the helpful suggestions everyone. I asked him about it today because it was needling at me, and he said it was because he has trust issues from his last relationship. His ex girlfriend went off her birth control without telling him and got pregnant in a ploy to get him to stay with her long-term because she thought he was going to break up with her. This is where his mind wanders when he's on the edge of cumming. Anyway.

I'm in my early twenties and have begun a sexual relationship for the first time. I'm his first as well, but he's much more confident than I am and very vocal about what he likes. I want to do the same for him but I'm a little inexperienced and haven't really explored myself (been trying to lately). 

I really like him and am aroused by him, but I'm worried that maybe I'm not as sensitive/tight as I should be. He enjoys the sex (if my legs are together - otherwise it doesn't seem to work for him). On my side it feels pleasant but it's not an intense kind of feeling... It's like a muted version of what I hear about from others. So I'm not sure I'm feeling what I should be. Or maybe I'm expecting too much?  

It is my first relationship and I feel sensitive about my body, as well as anxious for him to enjoy being with me. I also feel guilty for 'acting' like it feels more intense than it is, but I want him to enjoy himself and I'm worried he'll be discouraged by my difficulties. When I masturbate my orgasms are not very intense and I've always been a little disappointed by them, so I feel like the problem is some kind of lack of sensitivity on my side.

Elaboration on my question: I was raised in a family that has what I feel is a fairly healthy, open attitude towards sex; started masturbating quite early in life and was never told it was wrong or bad; have fairly good knowledge of what I enjoy and where I'm sensitive, test this knowledge regularly; have a great sex life with my long-term boyfriend, great communication, everything I can imagine wanting is fulfilled and same goes for him. Despite all that, I've never achieved orgasm, nor do I get any feeling of build-up during sex or masturbation. Sometimes too much stimulation of my clit can affect me emotionally to a point where it's unbearable (but I'm not really upset--unsure how to describe this), either alone or with someone, and once I got a really weird feeling, just...intense and abstract, that seemed like it could be orgasm, but it passed quickly and never returned. Anyone else experience this, or have advice, or...?

Also, I'm wondering if anyone can point me towards further resources on the need for a sense of connection (even just mental, not emotional/romantic/what have you) in order to enjoy sex. My googling leads me primarily to how to guides and cosmo advice columns, so I imagine my search terms aren't quite what they should be. I suppose I'm looking for a more personal/in-depth exploration of the topic and mental aspects of it, rather than 'talk to your girlfriend about your hopes for the future so she knows you trust her and sex is better'.

I'm 22 years old and I have never put anything in my vagina. No tampons, no toys, no fingers, and definitely no penises have been in there either. I masturbate pretty regularly but never touch it directly. I usually touch myself through my panties or with a massaging showerhead. Any thought of touching it directly or putting anything inside really freaks me out. Even looking at it in a mirror makes me feel uncomfortable.

I attended a Christian school for junior high and high school where sexuality was not openly discussed and so I kind of avoided thinking about it throughout my teen years. I didn't have my first orgasm until I was 19, and I didn't have my first boyfriend until I was 20. He wasn't very sexually experienced himself, but when I finally felt comfortable enough to let him touch me, I never let him put his fingers inside me. I did enjoy oral sex though, and he was very generous with it. The one time I thought I was ready to have sex, I freaked out when he started applying pressure and at that point I was done. That, among other issues, was the reason we broke up. I've been single for over a year now and I'm afraid I will ruin another relationship if I don't deal with this on my own first.

This is something I'm trying to get over, but so far it's causing a lot of stress and anxiety. I bought my first vibrator a few days ago and am trying to work up to putting it inside me. I used it externally last night and I liked it, so I feel good about it but I am going to wait a few days to use it again because I'm currently on my period. I thought I would take another step and try using a tampon. So far I've wasted 5 tampons because I have either been too tense or too dry or not even sure where to put it. I'm a slightly bigger girl so leaning over to see my vagina isn't easy. I've been using a mirror to see what I'm doing. I got so frustrated today I cried over it, which is just silly. It's just a piece of plastic with some cotton inside! Why am I so afraid of it?

I want to be comfortable with every part of my body. I don't know why I'm so afraid of the most intimate part of myself. Eventually I'm going to have to go to the gynecologist and get a pelvic exam and that will NOT go well if I'm all tense and nervous. For now the best I can do is to keep trying. I guess I'm looking for some encouragement. Or maybe a similar story and how you ladies dealt with it.

I've had one of the worse weeks I've ever had and I know the internet is no substitute for medical advice, but I'm stuck and miserable and confused about what's wrong with me.

Back in jan/feb I noticed a tiny lump on my vulva, it was slightly itchy but otherwise barely noticable. I went to the doctor who said it was nothing but a cyst and would go away on its own after a while. Though I wasn't entirely sure he'd seen what I'd been talking about (it's protrudant but really small and in an awkward place), and also some internet research told me that a bartholin's cyst looked nothing like what I had, but I stupidly believed him.

At this point I'd been with my boyfriend for just over a year, and we didn't use condoms as I was on birthcontrol and we were both monogamous and got ourselves tested regularly.

So about a month ago the lump is still there having not changed in size, shape, colour, anything. I went back to the doctor again (it's a family practise so I get a different GP each time, which can really effect your diagnosis I think) and after an examination he told me there was a chance it was a wart. He said it was most likely to just be a skin tag of some sort, but I still ended up tearing up in his office because of the suggestion. He tells me to get checked at the GUM clinic and come back. I couldn't really see how we could have gotten it as he'd told me that before me he had only ever had protected sex in all forms, and my only previous partner had been a virgin too.

That night on the phone to my boyfriend (moderate long distance) I asked him if he'd been checked recently, and explained what the doctor had said. He then told me that back in december he had to get two warts removed at his local clinic. I started crying a lot, I remembered him having the lumps when I had visited him and he had told me they were just papules. I thought they didn't look like papules but believed he wouldn't let me have sex with him if he wasn't exactly sure what they were. So from hearing this I'm really upset over him keeping this from me, he says he was told by the clinic that it's possible to develop HPV as a couple and that we both definitely had it by now, but it wasn't harmful. I wouldn't think in a million years he had been unfaithful, but I was distraught that he'd kept something like this from me for so long when I'd been working so hard to improve how we communicated and we were finally really happy in the relationship.

The next day I had my first A level exam of the year just to add more fun, then afterwards went to the GUM clinic. They took tests for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia as usual and did an examination to check the lump. This time I was really certain to not let the doctor leave until I was sure she'd seen the stupid thing, and told her about what my boyfriend had said. After much patronising explaining the different parts of the vulva to me (I'm not a hyperchondriac dammit! I was sent here by my doctor!) she assured me it looked nothing like a wart and suggested my boyfriend's doctors didn't know what they were talking about. 

So now I'm massively confused, and decide I was more angry than I had been the night before, and confronted him on the phone that night. I told him that the idea of him keeping something about my own health from me made me sick. We talked for hours, he cried for the first time in years. I said he needed to be in my city in two weeks for the follow up GP appointment to explain exactly what had been said to him and he agreed. Our relationship pretty much went back to normal, chatting every night though I was seriously miserable at what had happened and wasn't dealing great with all my school exams.

So last wednesday I pick him up from the station. We act couply as usual, though he knew I would be furious and upset if I started thinking about everything that was going on. We went to the appointment and the doctor doesn't trust the GUM clinics advice, so wrote a referral letter for me for a dermatologist who would decide whether or not this lump is a wart and whether or not to freeze it off.

On the way home we cried and argued, and I asked him how I was supposed to believe anything he said anymore. He then drops the big dramatic bombshell when we're home to tell me that he lost his virginity to me, and he had made up all the past encounters we'd discussed. I HONESTLY couldn't give a shit how much experience he'd had, we'd been together for so long it was pretty irrelevant anyway, I was just terrified by the fact he'd spent so much time just lying to me so much. The next day before he left we had another serious conversation that involved me telling him I couldn't move past all this. It was the saddest break up ever, we spent two hours sobbing and talking, neither of us wanted it to happen, he hates himself for causing it and I just want to go back to when I didn't know about all the lying and could just love him.

The next day I had my final exam which I know I absolutely blew I was in such a fucking state. I then managed to forget to pick up my referral letter so couldn't get it until monday, only to find out that the dermatogologist's drop in hours are monday morning so now I have to wait another week to find anything else out. I found this http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1g20ke/so_the_girl_ive_just_started_dating_informed_me/ thread today and don't know if it reassures me or scares me. HPV seems to have so many strains and I know I've been exposed to one which causes warts, but I should be vaccinated again them from the Gardasil jab, though I missed my catch up. I have no idea if I'm going to have this all my life and risk passing in onto all future partners.

I don't really blame him, it was awful that he didn't tell me this but it sounds like I somehow passed it to him. I'm hurt by all the lying but I want to speak to him so bad, I think back to when he asked me to change my mind about breaking up and I'm full of regret for saying no.

However, I'm a little more adventurous in the bedroom than he is. I'm usually submissive, and he's said that he is interested in being more dominant, but (and I can relate to this!) it seems to be easier said than done, even after talking about what I like. The other problem is that our sex has been a little... relationshipy if that makes sense. Like it feels a little more emotional than just friends with benefits sex, and he's expressed some worry that I'm developing feelings for him (although that also could be a little bit of his ego talking, haha). That's definitely not true! I'm really enjoying hooking up with no strings attached and don't feel the need to take anything further with him. 

Last time we hung out he mentioned that he likes it when a woman takes control, so I thought that next time we hang out I could take things up a notch and take charge. Hopefully that will add some of the spice that I'm looking for and get the ball rolling on a little more kinky sex!

I have had two instances of sexual abuse happen to me (neither of which I've ever told anyone about), once when I was 18 with my first boyfriend involving oral sex and once last year involving a friend who tried to force himself on me. I think both times I kind of just shut out what I was feeling at the time and I have never really spoken about them before. I had sex with other people after those instances but I always felt fairly disconnected from the situation and in hindsight I was probably only doing it because I thought it was what I was supposed to do.

Anyway, the reason I am talking about them now is because I am in a new relationship (after a very long time) with someone new and awesome who I trust and I am very comfortable having sex with - but I'm worried because the feelings of fear I have surrounding some things are starting to creep back. It probably sounds stupid but I'm worried about other things like oral and other things that remind me of what happened before. I don't really want to tell him about what happened because I'm scared he'll look at me differently.

I think what I'm just asking is if anyone else has any experience, can I get over this stuff? I don't want to not be able to do things with my new partner because of what happened to me before, it feels like those people are still holding me back and I don't want them to!

She's pretty prideful, so I figured maybe she was embarrassed she wasn't very good at it.

It turns out her ex forced her to do oral. She used threats and held her down, and even though it only happened once (and was the final straw in my partner ending a verbally abusive relationship), now it has some obviously very bad connotations for her. Hearing that, I felt like a monster for having pursued oral at all. Our sex life is already great, so I said it didn't matter that much to me, and if it hurt her to think about oral, then we didn't need to do it.

And that was true ... but there's still that part of me that really wants that form of intimacy. I give her oral, and I feel like it would be nice if she could give it in return, or if we could 69.

I can have an insane amount of multiple orgasms every time I have sex. I pretty much always get off, and I have, on average, about 30-40 orgasms every time. So as much as I feel like a slut at the moment because my ""number"" is so much higher than most of my female friends, I don't want to stop having sex. TwoXSex, self-esteem help please? 

**Edit** Also, I actually rarely seek out sexual encounters. I get hit on a lot so it's pretty easy to get some if I want some. I've been told, very often, that I look like a particular pornstar. I would love to have a more serious partner, and not just because the monogamy makes it easier to have even more orgasms (my record is somewhere around 80 with a guy who I was dating, although I kind of lose the ability to count by then). I can't figure out how to get guys to look at me as something for more than just sex.

**Edit 2** Since I feel like there's probably going to be a lot of interest in the multiple orgasm thing, feel free to ask any questions about it.",,False,,t5_2uczz,1340961913.0,,,True,t3_vscjf,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/vscjf/slut_problems/,

My breasts are of generous proportions, but like many boobs, they tend not to stay smooshed together unless some third party (bra, hands, etc.) makes them.

I fell for him really hard and he wound up telling me that he had never had romantic feelings for me. So trust issues.

* After my break up I tried to have sex with a friend of mine who I used to sleep with, but the one effort was a fail on my part.  I blamed alcohol and still being emotional about the break up.

* Met my new SO (M 27) about a month ago and he has been nothing but wonderful to me.  We have WAY more in common than old SO and he is extremely respectful of my boundaries and asking if I am comfortable with what we are doing.

Sorry for the super long post :s

So rewind to about October. I was at my college's theatre club room because i was having kind of a shitty day so i thought I'd just take a nap and relax. 

A few minutes later i get a text from a guy i know asking where i am, i tell him to meet me at the theatre room. He gets there, i break down and start talking to him about my problems, he comforts me as i cry and next thing i know he's got me pinned down on the couch, making out with me. 

A few minutes into that his hands start wandering to below my waist and i don't really stop him, i just go with it. Next thing i know, bam! Fucking jackhammering into my vag, i wasn't even turned on and it hurt like crazy. I've never done anything like that before and it scared me. He leaves after seeing that I'm uncomfortable, doesn't say anything. After he leaves i run to the bathroom and cry. I was bleeding and sore, i didn't want to move.

That was my first time being fingered and it wasn't even someone i knew that well. My best friend found out what happened and i spent about the next few hours having a nervous breakdown and crying to her because i was at a loss of what else to do, my shitty day just got worse. Was it my fault for not stopping him? What could i have done differently? Why me? I just felt dirty, it was so out of character.

Fast forward back to the present day. Now firstly, I've been with the most amazing guy ever for around 2 months now and yesterday i went over to his place. I feel super comfortable with him and i trust him immensely. 

We were just cuddling, talking and being silly and we started making out. I really wanted to please him and he said what arouses him is pleasing me so i basically told him that all i want is for him to be happy and he got to work! Haha. 

After kissing, licking and biting every inch of my torso he gradually moved his hands downwards. Throughout the whole thing he was just making sure i was ready, that he wasn't rushing me and that i was comfortable. I was super turned on and wanted him *so* badly but as soon as his fingers entered me i felt this wave of anxiety and pain as my muscles just tightened. He sensed something was wrong and moved from penetration to just rubbing me. 

Later he asked if he had moved too fast or what he did and i told him about my previous experience and how it traumatised me because i just associate fingering with intense pain, i wanted him but it just isn't working because my body just tenses up and i get really nervous.

He is super understanding about everything and told me to take my time, he isn't going to rush me into anything but i feel so bad.

I'm new to this subreddit, but I've found any 2x sub to really be extremely helpful and I think I can actually have a beneficial, clear conversation here. If I'm in the wrong place, I will gladly delete this post and head to the appropriate sub. 

So, here goes.

I'm a month shy of 19 and my boyfriend of two years recently turned 19 himself. We are happily committed, discuss our issues like adults, recently exchanged promise rings, and know that we are going to spend our lives together(young, I know, I know).

We have abstained from piv and anal sex so far. I have always wanted to wait until marriage, not due to faith, not do to romantic ideals(well, mostly not...), but because half of my family have ruined their life plans through unplanned pregnancies; my mom and her family moved to another state when she became pregnant at sixteen and didn't know who the father was, my dad isn't part of my older sisters life because he didn't want to spend his life with her mother and she refused to allow him to even consider being apart of my sisters life, my cousin had a child with a scumbag, she dropped out of school, went through major depression, and has had to fight multiple times just to get child support, and with the luck my family seems to have, I am just not willing to risk pregnancies, sti's, and the like.(I know, condoms and birth control are extremely effective if used correctly, they all were probably not careful enough, and I would just need to be aware of the risks...)

I have also told family that I'm waiting for marriage, and most of the responses that I get are eyerolls, or ""You'll never make it..."" or any variation of the two, which makes my blood absolutely boil.

Boyfriend has been completely understanding, we agreed to wait for piv sex for marriage. But, I'm having second thoughts. The more I read up on the effectiveness of birth control, or how awesome sex is, or how waiting is ""pointless"" and you need to be sure of your sexual compatibility or the first time is never good, or just thinking about having sex with my boyfriend, I get so excited and anxious and I question why we are waiting, and if it's even worth it. I've had this conversation with the boyfriend and he is up for anything I'm comfortable with, as long as that's truly what I want.

We still wouldn't have sex right now, we both still live with our parents and I am not comfortable with having full blown sex with our families anywhere near. We would wait until we moved in together(2-3 years, hopefully), which is a much shorter time period than when we are wanting to get married(5-8 years).

I just can't stop thinking about this conflict going on in my head. I want to have sex with him, but I don't want to put us in a compromising situation, or -I can't even believe I'm admitting this- give into all my family members when they said ""You won't make it"", and I know that's such a silly, stupid thing to even consider because it's no reason to withhold sex from someone, including myself, but, ugh!

I really don't know what to think/feel/do. I know most of reddit believes waiting until marriage is stupid, naive and childish, but I'd actually like to get a conversation going on this, if only to ease my mind. Do you have any suggestions/stories/comments/questions, twoxsex? Anything is welcome.

When I looked it up at one point, it seemed like the STD transmission rate was somewhat low, especially if he doesn't cum in your mouth.

Since he's said that he rarely cums from BJs (though he enjoys them), does this make it more okay to forgo the condom?  Am I just being paranoid about this?  He has slept with other women while we've been together, but the last time was during Labor Day weekend...

A few months ago, he came over to visit me for 2 weeks and everything went swimmingly for the first week or so...until his penis randomly decided to stop working. He was unable to sustain an erection and although the sex did suffer a bit for the rest of the trip, he claimed that it was probably due to stress but he'll get it checked out by his GP when he gets back anyway.

After that visit, our internet sex life which previously consisted of cam sex deteriorated very quickly. I have tried to initiate on numerous occasions and even going as far as stripping and masturbating on webcam but he'll always behave as though nothing's going on. Needless to say, these sessions always ended with me putting my clothes back on quickly while feeling horribly awkward and embarrassed. When I asked him about it he admitted that he no longer feels comfortable with being sexual with me after the trip but his GP told him that his ED is most probably psychogenic and that he'll make an effort to get used to being sexual with me again. He even suggested that we make cam sex a regular thing every weekend, which I agreed to.

Saturday finally rolled around and since I was out, I decided to buy a new set of lingerie to 'help' revive the dead internet bedroom. Later that day, I mentioned my new purchase and hinted that I wanted to model it for him...only for him to ask the most inane questions about where I bought it/if my friends helped me pick it out. That was the last straw and I exploded at him, saying that this was his idea and how humiliating it is for me to be throwing myself at him repeatedly only to be ignored so thoroughly. He claimed that he did not get my hints and that he didn't know I wanted to get frisky. What the fuck. Now, I've always thought that sex is about both parties being in the mood and not about one party 'getting the hint' and playing along for the other party's sake. In other words, I suspect that he's simply no longer attracted to me and is doing this out of obligation/pity. I'm due to visit him this November and he has assured me that our IRL sex life will be just fine and dandy despite all of this, a claim I am more than a little skeptical about because, well, if we can't even be sexual with each other on skype, how the fuck can our IRL sex life magically be better?!


**tl;dr - Long distance SO's dick stopped working due to psychological reasons and he has ignored all my sexual advances towards him after that.

I normally have an extremely high sex drive. My boyfriend and I have sex every day at least once (providing we have the time for it and see each other that day), and we have a really loving and fun relationship. I LOVE having sex with him and have a genuine fun time. A couple of days ago, I randomly lost my sex drive. A couple of nights ago, he woke me up in the middle of the night touching me (we have already talked about this and we both enjoy it), but I just wasn't into it and was really tired, so he stopped. Then the night before last night we had date night, which normally results in awesome sex, but I ended up being extremely tired (and not horny) again that night. (Note: This fatigue has come out of nowhere also, and I don't have an explanation for it.) The worst part, though, was last night.

Last night, we started giving each other backrubs and touching each other which turned into cuddling and kissing, he even went down on me, but I just couldn't get turned on. I wanted to have sex mentally and emotionally, but physically I wasn't getting wet at all and it kind of hurt a little when he stimulated my clit. Everything he did to me that normally turns me on just wasn't giving me that intense arousal. I was also, once again, randomly tired all of a sudden and somehow just wasn't into it. We ended up stopping because even though I was trying to get into it, it just wasn't happening.

I'm completely embarrassed and feel so stupid. This hasn't ever happened to me before. I've always had a high sex drive, but I just don't know what's going on with me. I haven't changed my diet, birth control, or anything like that so I don't have a reasonable explanation for myself. Have any of you ever dealt with something like this?

i'm adventurous and i like to be submissive.  some of my current toys reflect that (i maybe have an under the bed restraint system, some handcuffs, and a wonderful dp cock ring attachment in my repertoire).

my current favorite toy is a pretty plain glass dildo, slightly bent (designed, no doubt, to reach the ever elusive g spot, which i don't think it does particularly well, but that's ok), with some ridges.  i don't even know why i like it so much, other than the fact that it just generally feels good, lol.  well, and i can put it in the freezer and make it cold.  that's kinda fun sometimes :P

i've got a couple vibrators - nothing that i love at this point...i used to have a good waterproof one, but i think i wore it out a while ago.

at one point i bought a set of ""love balls""...was kinda disappointed on that front...

I usually don't approach sex in a technical way, I am very emotional and mental when it comes to sex.

Except for the person that I lost my virginity to I have been able to find the g-spot within seconds on every woman I have ever had my finger inside. (That makes it sound like there are so many of them, it is like 4) It is really easy to find. The pleasure that they get from it differs a lot though.

And the last 2 people I've had sex with had not found theirs on their own.

So, anyway, have you found yours? How do you feel when you read scientists claiming that it doesn't exist? Was it easy for you to find or was it hard? How do you like to get it stimulated?

The easiest way to find it, at least for me, is to feel the front wall of the vagina for the least smooth spot and it is usually more pleasurable with rhythmic pressure than friction.

I am 22 years old and engaged to an amazing man (24) who I love more than anything. We have been together almost 3 years. Our sex life was absolutely perfect until about 4-6 months ago he could hardly keep up with me. When we first met we had sex like rabbits. I am on birth control but I don't think that's the problem. We moved in together in January. I have no desire to have sex anymore and when I do have sex with him I hardly get wet at all. I have asked him to try different types of foreplay and touching. Nothing seems to work and he is very frustrated. We don't have any toys, not sure if that would work though I mean we never needed them before. We don't watch porn again we never needed/wanted to before.
I recently lost about 20 pounds changed my diet and exercise habits I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it.
He asks all the time and I constantly deny. He will always say stuff ""Well we haven't had sex in 2 weeks"" or something to that nature. 
I feel bad but I just have no desire. Sometimes I think it is me just being  mad/frustrated at him (I often describe him as a 5 year old because he will act like one all the time (not cleaning up after himself just generally acting childish, please don't yell at me for saying this) I know he's a guy and he's going to not always think of millions of different ways to clean and stuff but I dunno if I am subconsciously not wanting sex because I am frustrated with him or not?

I was also a virgin when I met him, whereas he was.. well, far from virginal.

But anyway, to the point:

Just now on Skype, the conversation turned to sex. And he confessed that he would enjoy cumming on my tits during sex.

Now, I'm open to that idea; I think you might as well try something before you decide if you like or dislike it. However, I know myself, and I know that I would definitely need to know about it beforehand, and that I would most likely be upset if he did it without warning.

But this is where it gets tricky. He says that if he has to ask, then it would ruin the moment, and he wouldn't feel turned on any more (which I don't understand, because every time we have sex/I give him head, he always tells me when he's about to cum, which I kinda like to hear, so I don't see the difference really). He said that we would 'feel a moment,' and that I would know what he was about to do, so it would be OK.

He said that having to ask isn't sexy, and that the worry of being declined (even though I told him that if he asked, I wouldn't decline) would kill it, and that he shouldn't have to ask for 'permission to come.'

I told him that I really don't mind him doing it as long as he asks, but he's saying he'd rather not do it at all, than have to ask beforehand.

I feel bad, because I don't want to disappoint him and deny him something that he enjoys, and that I myself am open to, but he isn't helping himself, by not meeting me in the middle!

There is some rather interesting stuff in there, that may seriously affect us and our relationships. Links are below.

I'm wondering about the experiences of people here: do you feel depressed after sex, either right after, or the next day? Do you feel (perhaps irrationally) a need to cuddle a lot over the next couple of days? PMS-like mental symptoms?

The science suggests that the cascade of brain chemicals can affect you up to 2 weeks after orgasmic sex. And that like a drug, lead you to feel like you want more, until you crash and need time to recover. And that daily touching, skin contact, cuddling, can mute this ""crash"" effect. And that this effect is particularly strong (to the point where it causes problems) in something like 5% of women.

I have seen in myself that the natural surge of interest in sex right around the time I ovulate can sometimes make me really interested, to the point of aggression, for a few days, and then I don't want *anything* until around day 4 or my period (which, perhaps not coincidentally, is about 2 weeks). But the effect is muted when I have less sex during my fertile time. Interesting. I wonder how much of this is brain chemistry. I am prone to depression at other times, as well as pms mood swings. I wonder if this is related.

This seems like a really welcoming community so I thought I'd try to get some opinions on a situation that is making me anxious. For the record, I'm 24/F.

I had sex with my FWB yesterday after not seeing him for more than a month. It was kind of awkward because we did it in the shower (I never realized how much of a logistical nightmare that is.) I was nervous after not seeing him for so long that while I feel like I was physically into it, I didn't do anything vocal (dirty talk, loud moaning.) This is a problem because he's expressed before that it seems like I'm ""not into it"" when we're having sex. I am into it, but it takes a higher degree of intimacy and some encouragement for me to be vocal. I feel like he thinks he did all the work yesterday and the sex was bad.

Even the communication after the sex was bad. When I said that earlier in the day I had gotten my second shot of Gardasil for HPV, he thought I said 'herpes' and had a panic attack moment over the fact that he thought I had herpes. I told him that before he texted me to get together yesterday, I was thinking of texting him on the weekend to get together. To which he replied that he has stuff going on every night of the week for the next week and all his friends are coming back into town for school and he'll be busy with them and blah blah blah.

I like this guy. He's not my soulmate, he's not even really relationship material (he's several years younger than me and it kind of shows,) but I like having sex with him and want it to continue for the foreseeable future, but I'd like to express a desire for more aftercare after we have sex. I'm concerned that this was just a summer thing and he's getting ready to phase me out. I also can't seem to get over this ridiculous negative feedback loop in which I'm nervous around him, so I'm shy and somewhat inhibited in bed, which makes me afraid that he thinks I'm bad in bed, which makes me more nervous around him. He's on facebook chat right now - do I message him and apologize for yesterday being awkward or just never mention yesterday again? Do I wait until Sunday when he's maybe less busy and message him to get together? Do I leave it alone and let him come to me when he wants to? I feel like I'm more stressed out than I should be over a FWB relationship but I'm an anxious person by nature.

I'm a total newb to everything fun and sexy so excuse my over zealousness. 




A few nights ago I was with my FWB(he and I are both 19. I am a virgin, he is not). We're both in our undies making out and I assumed the night would be one of those good 'ol 'kiss, suck, finger fuck' kinda nights. I got up to change the music and he grabs my underwear, yanks them down to my knees, bites my ass and throws me back on the bed.

Now at this point in my time being physical with my friend, he'd never done anything like it. It was exhilarating. (and simultaneously terrifying. I'd never removed my underwear up until then due to anxiety over some genital scarring.)

So he climbs over me, throws my legs over his shoulders and presses himself against me, while still in his boxers mind you. He's making this goofy face at me and I'm wiggling around protesting the position he's got me in. During my wiggling the flap on the front of his boxers got pushed aside a bit and his cock slipped out to rest firmly, and warmly against my pussy.

He apologized immediately and reached down to tuck himself away but in that second of dick to vagina contact I was suddenly filled with the *NEED* FOR COCK. It was completely inexplainable. I'd felt him through his underwear, no prob. But suddenly I [felt like this cat.](http://i.imgur.com/5Fjfx.jpg)
I had no intention of having sex with him from the start of our FWB relationship, just some fun first steps with my friend for like a month. And we were both clear on that. But oh god. No. I'd felt the call of the penis.

So he asks me whats up, because I guess I made a face and stopped fucking wigglin' finally. I grabbed his cock lightly and told him ""Straight up dude, I want this."" So he sits back and is all like ""You sure?""

Aaaand that's where I fucked up and didn't get laid.

:c

After he asked if I was certain, I started thinking. Which for me is usually bad. I talk myself out of a lot of great stuff and into stupid situations all the time.

So my reasoning for not having sex is as follows: ""**It's a novelty thing**.""

I'm the only one I know, I mean literally the ONLY ONE, who is still a virgin. And it's always a ""whoa really? You've never had sex?"" when I'm asked about that sort of thing. So yeah, novelty. I'm the token virgin friend. And for some reason I decided this was a good enough reason not to fuck.

I started birthcontrol June 13th. Exactly 2 weeks ago. My period started June 2nd and ended the 6th. I've had sex almost every day with my fiancee since it ended to now, and every time has been unprotected. I told my doctor that and she gave me Plan B to take right then and there. She said it'd cover me up to 5 days. She said my egg probably will release on the 16th and that Plan B should have stopped it.

Then that night on top of Plan B I took my very first BC pill.
My fiancee has never ever came inside me. We use the ""pull and pray"" as my doctor put it. My brother was telling me that I should still use condoms for a good 3 months because thats when the BC fully kicks in and your body gets used to it. I have no idea. My doctor said that I should use condoms for at least another week. and my brother(who isn't a doctor) said that didn't sound right and I should still wait 3 months.

So I'm paranoid. My period should start this Saturday if it's going to be 28 days apart. I was just wondering if the chance of pregnancy is high or if I'm just worrying for nothing.

I know not every time I have sex results in pregnancy but... I can't help how terrified I am of getting pregnant.

Sexual attraction can be hard to define, so here's how I define it. Aesthetic attraction is when you find someone pleasing to look at, like a beautiful painting. Many heterosexual women may feel this way about other women. Sensual attraction is when you want to hug and cuddle someone; many people may feel this way about friends and family. Sexual attraction goes even further: it's when you specifically desire sexual contact with a person.

As an asexual, I pretty much never find people sexually attractive. Think about the sex you aren't attracted to—that's kind of how I feel about everyone. However, I do develop sexual attraction when I become emotionally close to people (that's a type of asexuality on the spectrum called demisexuality).

-
 I never once became aroused the entire duration of the 5 year relationship, but we were best friends and were emotionally phenomenal. We had sex probably about a dozen times (because *That's What You Do*), but it was always exceptionally painful (even with a liberal application of lubrication) and we'd stop once I started to cry. Even foreplay (kissing, oral) intensely turned me off. We stopped trying after a few years, and spent the last two years of our relationship being completely asexual. We were each others' firsts, and both decided we were fine with a sexless relationship if we could have each other.

Then we moved to opposite sides of the country for graduate school.
-
I asked my (at-the-time) fiance if I could try being with a girl for the first time. He agreed, and encouraged me to explore my sexuality. Over the course of two months, I realized I was intensely attracted to women and was very, very into sex with girls. Eventually, my fiance and I had many long discussions, and ended our relationship amicably. 

Sex with women is amazing.
-
I still don't enjoy penetration with either fingers or toys (I find it really painful, even when I'm very aroused), but luckily, that is a complete non-issue in lesbian relationships. My current girlfriend and I have an amazing and active sex life.

Anyway, the thing is, I've told this story to a lot of people.
-
And many hypothesize that my distaste for penetration is what makes my body respond so positively to women. This would surprise me, because sexuality seems so much more complex than that, and because, in retrospect, I know I was attracted to women far before I knew I didn't like penetration. The fact that I don't like penetration AND that I happen to like sex with women seems like luck. 

So my question is:
-
What if I weren't gay? What do straight women do when they really don't enjoy penetration? My ex was mostly-fine with us being in a non-sexual relationship, but it did cause us both stress because he wanted it and I didn't. Do any of you have healthy sexual relationships with men where sex is essentially exclusively oral, and penetration is off the table?

One day I looked at myself down there and I noticed some scar tissue.

I love my boyfriend and part of me enjoys having sex with him. He's great, really loves foreplay and wants more than anything to make me cum. And I have physically came through manual stimulation, but I don't know if it was truly an orgasm. I just don't feel sexual. Ever. 

I am physically attracted to my boyfriend, in that I think he is  damn fine, but I never get that urge like, I want sex with you. Or anyone. 

I am also on Prozac and have been for a few years. I know this can cause sexual dysfunction and a lower sex drive, but since I've been on it since before I started masturbating I can't tell if it's an effect of the medicine or just my natural state of being.

I've been with my SO for a year now, he is my first and sex is usually really nice. In september of this year I went on a semester abroad and I started experiencing some pain (not much, just an irritating feeling) when masturbating sometimes and in the week my boyfriend came to visit me, sex started hurting like hell. 

When my semester abroad was over and I came back (and had regular sex again, yay) I had a stomach infection followed by yeast infection and so I thought that was what caused the pain. But when the yeast infection was cured, sex still hurt. At times it's so bad I just can't have sex. I went to the doctor and she did a full vaginal examination and nothing abnormal was found so she said it was probably vaginismus (she said it could have been caused by the stress of going away for so long). I have a gyno-appointment now but it's still a month away and I was just wondering if anyone here has had the same problem and could offer help. No worries, I know you are not doctors and I will obviously still go to the appointment and do treatment, but I figured I might as well get some help or at least some friendly words in the meantime. 

My SO is very very supportive and sweet but it's so frustrating to not be able to orgasm because of the pain. It doesn't always hurt and usually me on top hurts less because there's less friction but it's so frustrating not to just be able to do anything spontaneous anymore. It's always : ""does this hurt?"" and ""AUWTCH"".

One thing that bothers me is that I absolutely CANNOT orgasm from just vaginal penetration, even when my clit is rubbed during sex. It doesn't work for me at all. It feels good, but not enough. He's even hit my g-spot (I had to show him where it was and how to do it) but that still doesn't work. 

The only thing that can get me off is clitoral stimulation. For the past 5 or so months, I haven't had an orgasm from it. He doesn't like giving me oral, but does it sometimes just because I beg him for it. For the past 5 months, while hes giving me oral, I haven't been able to have an orgasm from it. Either I suddenly lose interest, or I get way too sensitive and have to ask him to stop. Even though he doesn't like doing it, I can tell he gets upset that I can't finish from that anymore. He tries really hard, though. He doesn't just lick it in one way the entire time; he always changes his technique and even tries sucking on my clit, etc. Nothing works. 

Anal sex is something I've been thinking about, since I can't think of anything else I could possibly do. I want to wait a little while to do that, though, because I'm still nervous about it. I've been reading lots of advice threads about anal. 

I guess I just need some advice. My boyfriend and I have tried tons of different positions, and the only way I can get off anymore is by masturbating.

I've always been a very sexual person. I used to think about sex everyday, masturbate regularely and watch porn once in a while.

I stopped for 2 years before i started taking it again.

Also, I'm a little worried because I don't feel extremely attracted to my SO  ( i feel horrible for saying this). If i compare to my past relationships, i've always chosen my boyfriends mostly based on their physical appearance. So obviously, i was always crazy attracted to them. With my current SO, it's a total different story. I truly love him for everything that he is and i love our relationship. Don't get me wrong, i find him attractive.. Just not AS much as I was attracted to my exes. I'm wondering if that could also be a reason for my low sex drive.

I want to say that i don't fantasize about anybody else. I just seem to have lost interest in sex! I don't even masturbate anymore. It's making my SO feel very self conscious and sad so I need help!

my second question is about insertion. i find it strangely difficult to get it more than an inch or two in. i know i don't have a shallow vagina, i've taken considerably more than a two-inch rubber ring. but i can never seem to get it to settle up behind my pubic bone where i want it. it's never come out on its own, but i would prefer to have it up higher...is there any way to help with that?

When masturbating or during foreplay I reach down there fully expecting to feel that familiar slippery sensation, and what's going on is more like the sahara. The rest of my body is all worked up but my vagina is still asleep.  

I've been having sex anyway, and using lube, but it's really not the same. I'm on the verge of losing my mind.
I've looked into female viagra, and it claims to help with bloodflow, but not lubircation, so it doesn't really fix the problem. Plus, the site looks shady as hell. There's also an herbal supplement called Provestra, and the site looks great, but I'm really wary of ""herbal supplements."" Have any of your tried either of those? Did they work for you at all?  


Please help me turn my lady faucet back on!

Right now, I'm in the process of finding a gynecologist who takes my insurance and should be able to make an appointment in the next few months (I recently turned 18 so it's time to go anyway).  
  
Now, I'm in the beginning stages of my first relationship and I feel as though I could be comfortable experiencing sex for the first time with him - if not for a few worries I have.  
  
For one thing, I have hair. Like, what would be considered a ""manly"" amount in an area that I don't like it to be. Dark hair that is a little on the long side. Basically, I have an abundance of butt hair. Like, on the cheeks and between. I can't shave it because it causes very bad irritation and I know that even if I end up waxing it, I will have to tell him about it at some point because I don't wanna wax my ass for the rest of my life. I'm worried it'll be a huge turnoff if we're making out and junk and when he grabs my ass, he feels all this hair.  
  
Secondly, I'm very concerned with the way I smell down there. My vagina itself has absolutely no odor, I've stuck a finger in countless times and done smell checks and everything and it's fine. The area around my clitoris and labia, though, always has a rather unpleasant buildup of smegma no matter how frequently I wash, and I'm concerned with how strongly it smells. I trim around that specific area and it's helped to cut down on the accumulation, but not a lot. Also, I get excessively wet at ALL times during the day - I am literally always wet to the point where it sometimes soaks through my pants.  
  
This SO I've started getting more intimate with is very very accepting and doesn't make a huge deal about aesthetics - he's told me countless times that he absolutely does not care about my stretch marks, my belly, or any of the insecurities I've mentioned and I feel lucky to have someone who likes me for me and who I can be gross around. However, I haven't brought up my main concerns with him because I feel too embarrassed. I'm really worried that as soon as I tell him he'll be really grossed out, no matter how much he says he doesn't care and that human bodies are on the gross side naturally. He's been showing a lot more interest lately in slipping his fingers below my waistband but I always stop him because although I do want to, I'm worried that there will be smegma and/or that I will smell bad.

I just find myself so ugly and unsexual, like it just seems silly for me to try to be sexy for him, so I don't really try and I just act coy and shy and it's probably awkward. It's weird because I think I am a moderately attractive girl, but when it comes to sex I just can't imagine why my boyfriend would continue to choose to have sex with me when there are millions of better looking women out there who would fulfill his fantasies better I'm sure. And I feel self-conscious because I know I can't be like the videos he watches or engage in all his fetishes. I mean we do some like footjobs but other than that I just feel like I bore him. And I feel like I can't let go during the act--I feel like I need to perform for him and have to do certain things and touch myself a certain way. Like I don't want to be ""un-ladylike."" I recognize that that is really silly.

I've actually told him how I feel many times and he is very supportive and he says he loves having sex with me, but I just can't believe him. It's gotten to the point where I won't initiate at all but then when he also doesn't initiate, I get upset or angry. It's fucking absurd. The more I bring it up, the more frustrated I think he gets. And it's like I base my entire worth in his eyes on whether or not we've fucked that day.

This is a bit complicated.,Czechmate85,15,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/16bsxt/bleeding_after_sex_15_weeks_later_not_looking_for/,"Preface: I AM seeing a doctor. I'm not looking for medical advice.. I'm just here for *input* any of you guys may have since I'm super worried. My next appointment is not until Tuesday.

Background: 
Let me start this by saying I've always had mid-cycle bleeding. I was in a relationship for 7 years with the same man and I do not have STD's (was tested a month ago). My ex gave blood all the time. (I didn't because I have a bleeding disorder). I recently slept with a man I've been seeing. Condoms were used for thole thing. I went down on him and he went down on me as well. I woke up the day after with a RAGING UTI (I didn't pee after sex), unbearable pain and blood in the urine. Then later that day I began bleeding vaginally and noticed a foul odor. Went to the Dr. who gave me antibiotics for BV, yeast, and also doxycycline to take while chlamydia is ruled out because she saw WBC's under the microscope which apparently happens with chlamydia. 
(I REALLY don't think I have chlamydia. I tested negative a month ago, and used condoms, but whatever. We'll wait and see.)

My question lies here: I've been taking the antibiotics for 3-4 days now and the bleeding has gotten WORSE. It's like a constant light trickle requiring a mini-pad. The odor is gone. The blood is fresh; bright red. I have mild cramping at times. I feel the infection is resolving BUT the bleeding is worsening. WTF is going on? I have a right ovarian cyst (3.3cm in size) but it's never wreaked havoc like this before. I also had cervical dysplasia and had a resultant colposcopy and normal Pap's since then. I cannot have another Pap until the bleeding stops. And it hasn't stopped!

Anyways.. I'm at a loss. Has ANYONE had anything similar happen to them? I'm borderline panicking. Any input is greatly appreciated! &lt;3",,False,,t5_2uczz,False,,,True,t3_16bsxt,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/16bsxt/bleeding_after_sex_15_weeks_later_not_looking_for/,

Sorry if this has been covered before but it didn't seem like it. Plus I have to admit to also just wanting some support in this issue.

So when I was much younger I was sexually assaulted (on a date) and since then I have not really been able to orgasm with a partner.

The few few times it has happened in the past 6-7 years has been with only one guy and that's because he followed every single step I asked him to take. It was a long and arduous process.

My current problem is that, being single and having a couple of on-and-off partners, I can't exactly take them through the detailed hour-long process of getting me off (we don't have that kind of intimacy, it took me close to 6 months with the ex-bf).

So how do I get past what appears to be a mental problem (physically it has happened so this must be an emotional/mental thing, right?) on my own and with **some** support from my sex partner but without the process relying totally on him?

I just want more autonomy in my orgasm. Right now it's so dependent on what the guy is doing that it's very frustrating for me.

I should add that I *can* achieve orgasm very easily through masturbation and with toys. That is no problem at all. Vaginally, clitorally. All of it checks out. It's when you add a living breathing man into the equation that I lose all feeling.

Oh yeah, maybe I should have added that. I lose feeling down there pretty quickly when I'm with a man. Even if he's only orally pleasuring me or using his fingers. 

So...any thoughts? Suggestions? Tips?

**tl;dr: I tend to lose feeling and be incapable of achieving orgasm when I am with a male partner. I want more autonomy in achieving orgasm without it relying mostly on his actions. I can orgasm alone through masturbation both vaginally and clitorally**

We are both very satisfied with our sex life, but obviously there's always room for improvement and we wanna experience each other in every way possible!

So, on to the questions: First, I have never had a clitoral orgasm. I enjoy being eaten out, vibrator, etc. but have never had an orgasm from it (I don't think. It feels nothing like the other kind!) Am I just not capable? Or are we not doing it right for me? My boyfriend is very receptive and open to critique, always wants to make it better for me, but I honestly don't know what I want!

Also, we stumbled across the topic of female ejaculation. We both thought it sounds awesome! But, from what we've read, it's rare? Or hard to accomplish? We don't really understand it. It comes out of your urethra?? So confusing. What exactly is it, and how can we try to make it happen? I've read every how-to and info page I could find but to no avail. Any information or tips on the subject would be welcome!

TL;DR I've never had a clitoral orgasm. Am I incapable of it, or just haven't had one? Also, female ejaculation: how does it work and how can we try to make it happen?

I know you can't just ""make"" something like this happen, but we'd like to try. We're not stressing about it or making it our main goal.

I recently started seeing this really cool dude. He's 21, I'm 20, we go to school together, anyway he's just awesome. Last night we made it to my bedroom for the first time (after several sloppy makeouts in semipublic places -- oh to be young). very fun times.

both of us decided we wanted to hold off on sex for a little while (probably not long, seeing as both of us were losing our resolve by the end of the evening, but this is our plan for now). We're both recently out of long-term relationships and want to take things on the slower side. this is the context.

SO last night, after all kinds of fun activities, I decide it is time for me to reciprocate and I start going down on him. I end up doing this for a while sort of (or at least longer than I had expected to), and eventually he pulls me up and says, ""okay, so i don't want you to get the wrong idea, because you're *very* talented, but a lot of times that just doesn't do it for me... like, most of the time, it just doesn't work. not that i'm not enjoying myself, because I really am, but I thought I'd let you know.""

So I ask, ""Alright, well what does do it for you?"" and he's like ""um... sex.""

This was not some kind of passive-aggressive pressuring move, by the way. A bit later I pretty much implied I was very open to the idea of just fucking right then, and he took a sec to consider it and decided he still wanted to wait (a good thing, considering I was super horny and was not exactly thinking clearly)

First things first- I'm 23, and have been married for 3 years. My husband is and always has been my only sex partner. 

Ok, so for a while I thought I may be asexual, but that's not true because there are times when I want sex- and even times I REALLY want sex. So I'm OK there. The problem is that I often want the idea- and chicken out when given the opportunity. I have a couple hangups, and I know the causes (usually) or at least the feelings behind them, I just don't understand how to overcome them for good. More on that in a bit.

Ok, my first hang up is that I can't initiate sex and/or I lack the confidence to be on top- often leaving him to do ""all the work"" which annoys him, and I feel mildly bad about. I know this is a confidence issue, and my dear husband is wonderful at boosting my confidence... I just fold when I try either of these things. Anyone else struggle with that? How can I get past this? Preferably in a way that doesn't make me cringe through it? 

The other big hangup I have is his cum. We try and remain open about  talking about it, but I get really flustered and feel bad because intellectually I know 1-there's nothing ""wrong"" or ""dirty"" about it. and 2-he can't help it. It's natural and ok. Ok? See, I know that. But somehow it just... freaks me out? I don't even know if that's the right word... there's definitely an ""ew"" factor though. I really can't give him oral at all (unless I seriously just read a book on how-to that day. For some reason reading up on it relieves the feeling a little bit- but I still can't handle him orgasming that way... )and I can't deal with/handle hand jobs (haha. handle. awesome.). I'm fine with sex because then it's inside me (mostly) and I don't think about it (much). Also (TMI warning?) I like the feel of it IN me. That I like, and I can handle.... but I know he likes handjobs/oral as much as I do and I just.. can't. Am I the only one that struggles with this? Everywhere I read girls LOVE giving their guy oral, and something about him cumming outside of me just... freaks me out. What can I do? (Besides repetitively reading ""how to"" books. It's not that he makes me feel incompetent, and I dont' even really feel incompetent anyways after the books that I've read. I think it's just the ""ew"" factor, but how do I get over that? Please help me if you have any ideas.

Also, feel free to share your hangups so even if I AM the only one that feels this way (could it be related to sensory issues with Austism? I do have Asperger's Syndrome...) then at least I will know I'm not the only one with hang ups of some kind.

Generally I wouldn't post something like this but this topic has been weighing on my mind a little. I was hoping I could just talk to someone about it.  
    
Here's the backstory:  
My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. We have known each since we were 6, have been friends since, and started dating at 15. We are now 20 years old and are still as in love as we have always been. My problem? Sex drive. He has ALWAYS had a high drive. I'm talking wanting to go 3 times a night. Myself, on the other hand, have always been on the lower end of libido. I had some abuse in my child hood and never really recovered a want for constant physical intimacy. I could enjoy it once I was worked up enough but for years it has been something thats frustrated me. I've always wanted to be able to match my SO, you know? Mentally I could. Physically was a completely different battle. He's been so understanding and loving with me, our relationship is great. However there is a recent development in our sex life and it's so frustrating...I think my delay of sexual energy has caught up with me. I am horny ALL THE TIME. I mean, miserably so. I can't get enough and it's physically painful. The other bad news? My SO's sex drive has gone down..tremendously. It makes no sense to me. My hormones kick in and his suddenly kicks out. He's still attracted to me but he doesn't seem to want sex/intimacy as much. I feel bad now that i'm on the flip side and don't particularly know what to do about this. It feels like a kick to the ego now that I just want to jump his bones all the time and he's just meh. We had a moderately active sex life before. I'm so new to this constant want/need and i'm embarrassed about it. How do you ladies deal with a high sex drive when your SO doesn't seem to want any?  
    
**TL;DR**- My boyfriend has always had a high libido. I have not. Now it seems it has all caught up to me and SO's libido dips out. I'm miserable and don't know how to handle this sex drive.

However, last night my boyfriend came round and things got a little ""heated"" but when my boyfriend tried, he couldn't find where to put his penis and then it was too tight and then he lost his erection.

We then tried again to have sex but this time we used loads of lube but he still couldn't get it in and then he lost it again. He was really angry and embarrassed and wouldn't look at me/touch me afterwards. I told him it was okay if we went slow and I started to give him a bj and he went completely soft in my mouth. He left my house shaking with anger and really embarrassed. He didn't even look at me or say anything when he went. 

This whole situation is making me feel like crap because I love my boyfriend so much and I'm worried this is a sign that he isn't attracted to me anymore and we're doomed to split up. I just want to help him but he didn't tell me what was wrong. He texted me later saying he was sorry and he wasn't angry at more but more like frustrated with himself.

I really don't know what to do.. I feel pathetic because I'm crying about it, haha...

- I can't use hormonal contraceptives, since they have made my vulvodynia worse (and possibly initiated it) in the past.

- I can't use spermicides.
- I'm sensitive to most lubricants (there are a few I can use), so I'd like to avoid pre-lubricated condoms if at all possible.

- We might want kids in the future, so no permanent birth control.

I haven't found a male condom that is large enough while not containing latex, spermicide, or lubricant. Female condoms are a possibility, but from my research, they don't offer quite as much pregnancy protection as male condoms and could cause too much external irritation.

However, the other day I found myself getting rather hot and sweaty with a very attractive guy. I have 4 questions which I'm not quite sure about, and as most of my friends are gay, I don't have anyone to give me (expert) advice!
1) I was on top, and biting my lip (I do this involuntarily when I'm enjoying myself, also I like the feeling), and he said 'don't bite your lip' to me. Why would anyone say that? It was just a natural response of mine, and I'm kinda upset about him telling me that. I mean, okay, I probably looked stupid, and I am worried he thought I was 'trying' to be sexy. But it just happens involuntarily... 
2) He was really sweaty. When he left, I noticed that my sheets were soaking wet! Is this normal for a guy? He also had quite a strong odour. Not horrible, just noticeable.
3) Generally when having sex with a guy, is it okay just to make him do all the work i.e. thrusting? Or what should one be doing? Especially when on top?
4) After our fun, which was obviously mutually satisfying, he tried to make plans to see me again. I told him sure, and texted him on Friday with a general 'hi, how are you?' text. He hasn't replied. Do you think he didn't actually want to see me again, and just asked because at the time he was feeling really 'good' about it? I'm confused...

Only been having sex with one partner for a little over a year, and it's been fraught with issues. It's been horrific. [Here's a link](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1d5afk/having_sex_has_ruined_huge_parts_of_my_health_my/) to a much more detailed post if you feel up to it.

Basically, I see loads of questions about pain during sex, and while others describe the sensation (burning, stinging, tight feeling at the entrance, difficultly stretching, tearing), they don't describe the level of pain. This week was the first time in about 3 months it didn't hurt to have sex. I hadn't even been noticing the pain, I'd just gotten used to it. That's in part because on a bad day I spend 2-3 hours in absolute agony - can't walk and just lay there and cry. On a good day, the pain is there, but it's not enough to stop. 

Hence;

- If you do experience pain, how bad is it?
- How long does it take to go away?
- How often do you tear (if at all)?
- Am I just 400%  abnormal? Has anyone else gone through this?

Also, I went through a stage when my partner didn't even bother to get me off. It's pretty easy to make me come, but this stage really killed my confidence and my expectations of what is normal. So I just wanted to know, with your partner, what percentage of the time do you come? I think I come maybe 10% of the time. I get that's probably not normal considering it only takes 10 mins max to get me off. 

Edit: It's not issues with lube. I've talked to doctors about this but it was in conjunction with other issues so I'm pretty sure my gyno missed how serious it can be.

So about two years ago I started dating a man who was rather large. After he pulled out there would always be a bit of reddish discharge on the condom, not from spotting or my period, but this never really bothered him or me.

Since then, every time I've had sex, and with every man, this has always happened. It's even to the point where I'll bleed for a few days after.

So I'm seeing this new guy now, and blood freaks him out. A lot. He's also well-endowed, so the bleeding situation is worse with him that it has been before.

I'm not sure what to do. I've gone for a full pelvic exam/STI panel, my results haven't come back yet but the doctor said I had no signs of anything wrong. I've also been experiencing abdominal pain (I'm on the pill and I'm not pregnant) so I just had an ultrasound done and I'm waiting on the results of that too. Every STI panel I've had in the past has always come back clean.

The blood doesn't seem to be due to a lack of lubrication; sex isn't painful and I always use lube if we need it. I'm not a tiny woman by any means, so I'm not sure that it's some sort of tearing. I ache after sex, but it's a good ache, not an ""ahhh my vagina's just been split by this massive cock"" ache.

This gentleman has asked me to douche before we have sex. I've heard that douching isn't good for vaginal health, and since we're rather enthusiastic, that would involve a LOT of douching. I always try to keep myself clean, so I don't think there's any sort of leftover material in my vagina that would be coming out when I have sex.

Is it possible that if my cervix gets hit during sex, that menstrual blood might come out? Could I be tearing something up there? Is there any way to clean myself that could be effective in stopping this issue without causing any yeast infections or problems like that?",,False,,t5_2uczz,False,,,True,t3_14dh27,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/14dh27/discharge_during_sex/,

I've been bicurious (or curious, idc however you want to coin it) for as long as I can remember.  How do I hit on girls?

Also, I'm slightly terrified of the idea of going down on a girl.  It's irrational - I've given head to guys numerous (as in, countless) times, and have zero problem with it.  But for my first time with a girl, I want to be passive - seriously, I just want a more experienced (or braver/more confident!) girl to just have her way with me.

I've been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, and I lost my virginity to him about a year ago. However, as we are long-distance, we often go 4-7 month stretches without seeing each other, which means that every time we see each other again, sex hurts the first few times. Which is to be expected.

But, after a few times, I've noticed that the bottom of my vagina; the very opening itself, the part closer to my anus - the lower half of the opening ""ring,"" if you will - feels pretty sore. Like, as if it were cut or something. This limits our positions, as anything from behind exacerbates this soreness. He is always very patient and gentle with me, and on a few occasions it's been too sore to continue - and while he is always quick to stop, and tell me that he doesn't mind, I still feel bad for him, and would like to be able to be more adventurous in bed, without having to stop all the time.

I am also (or I have been told by him) extremely tight, which means that it can be difficult for him to get inside me sometimes, especially if he has already made me climax during foreplay. After the initial few seconds though, it is not usually painful when he is inside me, apart from the aforementioned vagina soreness. 

This week, I've been out of action due to a UTI, but in a couple of days I think I'll be in the mood for sex again. Any tips on how to avoid the soreness? I'm on the pill, and we don't use condoms, but I am always really, really wet (like, to the point where he comments on it and seems surprised sometimes haha) when the time comes, so I don't think lubrication is the issue.

He is quite sexy, has the whole I'm in a band thing, and is a genuinely caring person which makes every girl fall head over heels for him.  Hes been dating girls since he was 13 Combine that with the fact he was homeschooled his entire life so when he first went to college it was like an explosion of pretty girls.

Anyway he's done more sexually ie had two girls (sisters I believe) give him head at the same time while the craziest thing I've done was fool around in a locker room after school.

I felt amazing. I was less depressed (and I thought my depressed feelings were not related to the pill) and I was no longer nauseous or getting migraines (which I knew DID come from the pill). 

I've had sex once since going off the pill, and I've fooled around countless times with only two different men.  The guy I had sex with had a condom on, and I've had several periods since, so I'm not pregnant, but I had to pregnancy scares or paranoias, both fairly irrational. The one was after I fooled around with a guy, and we didn't even have sex, but we were naked together and I though I would be the small percentage of women who gets pregnant from sperm swimming up when it's close enough to the vagina. It didn't happen. The other one was just hoping the condom worked. 

So my body feels better, and my libido is way back up where it used to be before I went back on the pill, but the paranoia isn't worth it at all. I am not seeing anyone at the moment, so I have some time to think things over and experiment with different methods, but I want to find one as soon as possible in case I meet someone new.

I know every women reacts differently, but I still feel the need to ask you all. What has worked for you? Copper IUDs? Nuva Ring? Did your insurance cover the pricier methods? Are there some methods that allow you to get wetter than others? I am bone dry down there on the pill and it sucks. I'm almost never horny, which sucks because I love sex!

We’re both pretty inexperienced (she was a virgin prior and I had a single one night stand while I was too drunk to remember much of anything) so some tips would be appreciated. I read here some girls can’t cum from penetration alone? If this is the case it would likely be the issue since we normally just start with some fingering until she’s properly prepared &amp; lubed for entry and then just thrust in various positions until we decide we’re ready to be done (at which point we get into a position that allows me to cum). The thrusting portion generally lasts somewhere between 45 minutes and 2 hours (2 is the longest we gone so far).

Some of the other possible issues we've thought of are the condoms, I've heard Trojan (magnum are the ones we use) condoms can be too thick? We are planning to try thinner ones but my options are limited as my girth is a little more then a number of condoms are made for... the magnum ones are even a bit snug. On that note another possible issue was that at times I’m unable to remain fully erect while using a condom (hard as a rock during any hand job / blowjob situations, literally as soon as the condoms on it becomes an issue, possibly because of the snugness). Third possible issue is since we’re both young privacy is an issue as we both live at home with parents and can only have sex late at night while being quite, thought maybe being nervous and worrying about not making too much noise could be a contributing factor.

I have recently been put on anti-depressants for depression symptoms, and got blood work done that day to make sure I wasn't anemic or deficient in anything.  
Got a call back from the doctors today saying my thyroid level was low and that they want me to come back in in 4 weeks to get more blood work done. The normal is .45-4.0 (I believe those numbers are right), and they said my level was .48  
I have felt ""depressed"" for a while due to extraneous circumstances in my life, but have also gained a small but noticeable amount of weight, my hair got drier and started to fall out more than normal, and a few random symptoms I attributed to stress.

I'm not trying to jump the gun, I guess it could have been a fluke. I will know more after the next round of blood work, but I noticed the weight gain and symptoms I'm seeing mostly after I got my Mirena IUD inserted around a year ago in March.

Are people sensationalizing this trend or is there any actual medical correlation between the two?

I have a quick question for anyone who has vulvadynia or anyone who is familiar with this condition.  My doctor put me on amitriptaline, which helped reduce the pain, but didn't completely get rid of it.  I've been on it for about a month or two now, but am constantly exhausted as a side effect, and have decided to gradually stop taking it.  


I know I need to see my doctor, but I'm a university student, so it's hard to schedule appointments.  I'm just wondering if anyone has any methods of treatment that have worked for them.  I wouldn't be opposed to trying a different medication, but I would like to go an alternative medicine route, if possible.


Also, it may be important to know that my vulvadynia is not severe (only bothers me when I have sex and sex is not impossible or overwhelmingly painful, like it is for some).  But it is definitely painful and makes sex un-enjoyable, so I know I need to do something about it.

Any advice to help overcome this?",HalcyonHeart,10,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/1ae5m4/i_used_to_be_very_insecure_with_myself_but_while/,"Hey there everyone! Decided to make a new account to make my first post here, really hoping to get some advice here!

I'm not sure if it matters, but I'm 21 years old and I have a ""friends with benefits"" situation with a good friend of mine. It was supposed to be a one-time thing, but it turns out we're pretty compatible so we've continued since the first time. When I say ""fool around,"" I mean everything but penis-in-vagina sex. To that, we're both virgins.

I'd first like to say he's GREAT. The first time we tried anything together, I was super nervous and he made absolutely positive that I was comfortable and wanted to do what we did. Since then, he's really helped me to feel more comfortable with myself/my body in our subsequent encounters, and he's at least part of the reason I feel more confident as of late, both in general and when I'm fooling around with him.

So anyway, one thing that I still struggle with is opening my eyes while this is all going on. I'd love to look at him at least part of the time, as I'm pretty sure he looks at me most of the time while this is happening. I know he finds it hot when I make eye contact with him, but while in the past he's occasionally asked me to try and look at him, he knows I find it hard and he doesn't push it, nor has he asked me to lately.

As for why I don't...I know it's from insecurity, but I'm not sure why (or what) causes me to close my eyes. I think maybe it's because, in a way, I'm still nervous and closing my eyes ""blocks it out"" in a way that doesn't make me feel as awkward? Maybe I still feel like I'm doing something ""wrong"" by doing something sexual, especially with someone I'm not ""with""? Maybe it's just residual shyness (in general) that makes it hard for me to make contact, but I feel like I've gotten better at that in non-intimate encounters.

Here's a specific example in case it helps, but one time he asked me to try looking at him while I was giving him a blowjob. He was standing, so I was looking up but once I saw him enjoying it (his ""O"" face, I guess haha), I found I couldn't look at him anymore, and it feels almost like embarrassment I guess which is why I look away.

Sorry this is long, but I'd really appreciate any advice you ladies could give me to possibly overcome this! 

Oh, two last thoughts that might possibly be relevant: 1) The one time I tried watching porn (with him), I also felt similar. Kinda awkward and embarrassed, like I was seeing something I shouldn't. 2) I find him very attractive both physically and otherwise, so I'm pretty sure it's not embarrassment of being with him (which I know I *have* felt with some guys in the past).

Looking for thoughts/advice/encouragement :),Fey_fox,11,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/16w5e6/entering_a_sexual_relationship_after_years_of_not/,"I've been single for about five years, and during that time I've had hookups here and there but not on a regular basis and very spaced out (I may have had sex on average of once or twice a year roughly). The being single was mostly voluntary, my last relationship ended roughly and I've been working on myself and my career. I am very content and satisfied with my life for the most part, but I still don't have the time to pursue a relationship with another person.

HOWEVER, I've grown tired of celibacy. I'm in my late 30's, and I don't want to become one of those dried up women who don't fuck. Which brings me to my current, most amusing, predicament. I've struck up a friendship with a guy 10 years my junior who works near me (we're not co-workers, but we share space in a building and we work in similar fields. Closest thing you can call us are work-neighbors). After hanging out and casually chatting, he made a pass at me and, long story short, we've struck up a friends with benefits situation. 

This gent, is fucking adorable. Long blond hair, physically fit, smart, many of the things that flip my switches. We've messed around a few times (mutual masturbation, no sexual intercourse), and he's more dominant than most of the guys I've been with. He enjoys talking to me and seems very interested in exploring this, but isn't interested in a monogamous relationship which I'm fine with. This seems all win-win.

The problem I've been experiencing is some insecurities on my part. Part of me wonders why someone like him would be interested in someone like me. It's not just the age difference, I am a BBW, and I've experienced some weight loss in the past year and I'm embarrassed by some loose skin. I'm still a big girl too, I'd say I'm good looking but my body isn't... what I'd call attractive. I look at porn that features BBW's that feature bodies like mine and I can't get into them. I watch them trying to see what others might find attractive about my body type, and I just find it difficult. There are some hot ladies out there, don't get me wrong, and I read the responses and obviously there are people out there that are indeed huge fans, but I have trouble seeing myself as desirable. 

This can affect my involvement with this guy, or any guy. Logically I know he knows I'm not a small animal. So logically, I shouldn't be ashamed with being naked and sexual with him. However I've felt very shy, plus it's been so long since I've been able to open up to anyone in this way. I know the problems are mine, I'm just trying to find a way to work through them. If I can, this could be a lot of fun for both of us.

TL;DR: old ass fat chick lands a FWB situation with younger hot guy after years of being celibate, how do I work past them personal insecurities?

I've been a complete failure when it comes to school. I was horrible at paying attention, staying organized and just doing what I was supposed to. Then, when I realized, if I didn't start pulling my weight, I'd end up a failure like my older brother who is addicted to drugs and can't support himself, his wife or care for his own child. I've always been afraid to disappoint my family, and to not be able to make them proud of me... So I started trying in school- Doing my absolute best and giving all my effort. But it wasn't enough. High school flew by, and I was a senior with enough credits to be a freshman- It was obvious I wouldn't pass. I decided to drop out, and just pursue my GED. That alone stressed me out. Being a drop-out and all. Now, the stress is adding up; I'm pushed, nagged and bothered 24/7 about getting a job, and finishing school as well as taking a test to get my permit. I understand my family is trying to help by pushing me to do my best- But it's draining me. I apply to job after job, and I study like crazy- But more and more stress is added. I moved to live with my father and his wife, along with their daughter, my step-sister.They're richer than my mother was, and I'm afraid they just don't understand. It's as if, their popularity and reputation rides on my success. I don't want to disappoint them. I recently went to visit my boyfriend, to see him since we're a bit of a long distance relationship, and to hopefully just get a break from my usually hectic life. We've been together for almost a year and have only seen each other one other time for less than a week back in April. The visit was fantastic~ So much so, I lost my virginity... You may see where this is going. I do believe I may be pregnant... I mean, it's a total long shot, but it's still stressing me the fuck out! I may be paranoid since it's been just over a week since we've done it, but I'm having the symptoms - a great majority of them anyways.

I'd love to have kids, but just not now. I can barely support myself, let alone a child, and neither can my boyfriend(Although we have talked about it and if I am then he's willing to move closer and do everything in his power to support us). I'm afraid if I am pregnant, my father would blow up. He's done so much for me by spending tons of money on flying me down, moving all my things, my GED testing, permit testing, PLUS him driving me to my boyfriend. He warned me not to have sex, but I did it anyway despite promising not to. I love my boyfriend though, and he loves me. I know this is going to sound incredibly cheesy and everybody says this(people also say the whole ""and I know this is cheesy and everybody says this"") but neither of us can see ourselves in the future without each other, and we're both adults. Is it really THAT bad to just want to have sex with my boyfriend who treats me so amazingly? He wasn't trying to pressure me into it or anything either; he was constantly asking if I was sure I was ready, if I really wanted to do this, then he was so sweet and loving when actually doing it. We used all the precautions (Condom, Birth Control, and it was my first time). Except for his initial entry, there was no condom. We were both incredibly nervous since it was both of our first times(19 and 18) and he was having trouble staying hard at first, so I let him put it in without the condom just for a little, but he made sure to pull out, put on a condom, then continue as soon as he started getting close. We only did it twice during the visit and both times the condom was perfectly fine, so the only cum that got in me was a little bit of precum. Can you get pregnant from a little bit of precum? Well I mean I know that you CAN, but even so I was still on birth control and it was my first time(I know it being my first time doesn't make it safe, but it does help, doesn't it?) I DON'T KNOW.

I've been having sex with a guy on my floor (I'm 18f, he's 23m), and we had unprotected sex twice. Well, he came up to me today and told me that he found out on Tuesday that a girl he brought over a few months before gave him HPV.

Now obviously, I need to get tested. I had one out of three HPV vaccines so far, so that isn't helping. But the main problem is that I'm a broke college kid. There's a Health Services on my campus, but it costs $45 for a pap smear and $70 for an HPV test. I don't have that much cash and I don't have the student insurance which would take care of that. I'm honestly just in a rut when it comes to what I should do about this.

After purplerainboots suggestion, I did take the Love Language test and had my bf take it as well. Not surprising, but my language was physical touch and his was spending quality time together. I definitely think it helped to both acknowledge this and understand how we both express our love. We've come to an understanding now and I think things are a bit better now. We've been joking about speaking ""each other's love language"", so he's been giving me more hugs and there's been a slight increase in the sex (could be a little more of an increase in my opinion haha).

Hopefully we'll keep up our understandings of each others way of expressing love! And I've been trying to not mention having sex lately, because it really does kill the mood when you talk about it a lot. I'm trying to just let things happen naturally.

Another thing we realized is that sometimes we're very ""cute"" and ""lovey-dovey"" (people would probably think we're sick honestly), which kind of takes away from the passionate sexiness we see in each other. We're trying to be slightly less cute, and I'm personally trying to be a bit more sexy so he wants to have sex more often!

All I know is I feel pretty bad and I would like some other woman perspectives. Hell, men's is welcome too.

I have this ongoing problem with my fiancee. I feel like we just can't get our communication right and I feel like we're just sexually doomed. And the negative part of me says that we're incompatible.

We woke up today and immediately started cuddling. Still half asleep. He sleeps naked and I happened to brush by his morning wood and immediately get aroused. After awhile of getting up the nerve, I start jerking him off a little. Very subtly. Don't change our cuddling positions, I just reach down and grab it. He makes no reaction. None. Doesn't moan, doesn't start kissing me, etc. Acts as if I'm not even doing anything. It goes on for awhile while I lay there hoping something comes of this. It doesn't. I ask him why he doesn't seem to care and he said he thought he was dreaming. I'm now discouraged and kinda just lay there. He then rolls over to me and takes my breast and starts sucking on it. And then here I'm thinking ""yay finally!"". Then he stops and pulls my shirt back up, goes to get a towel from our closet, says he's gonna go get in the shower. I said ""really?"". He acts like I'm stupid. ""yeah?"". I then feel totally rejected and frustrated that he is so completely oblivious and I pull the blankets over my head. He then crawls on top of me and asks if I want to come with him. ""no"". (you may think that was his invitation to come do sexy things in the shower, and if I thought it was, I would have jumped all over it. But I knew it wasn't because he hates doing anything in the shower since its so hard. and he always acts silly, like we're outside playing with the sprinkler or something. I try to avoid showering with him.)

He comes back, and puts on his underwear and starts to turn on the computer. I thought hey maybe when he comes back he'll start messing around with me. Nope. Wishful thinking.

He asks me whats wrong like 5 times and I just stare at him. Then he starts getting mad. ""If you're not going to fucking tell me what's wrong then I'm not going to care!""
""I'm not trying to make you upset, but I'm upset and don't know how to talk about it""

He gets madder and madder. I ask him what he thinks is wrong. He says he doesn't know. That we were cuddling, and then he got in the shower, and now that he's back, I'm mad all of a sudden. I said I was mad before the shower.

He starts getting ready for work and I still just lay there. He finally comes over to me and asks me nicely whats wrong and I still don't have the guts to say it so I stay in silence. He says ""fine, I'll be back later"".

And I thought that he left. 5 minutes later he comes back up and lays next to me. ""One last time, what is wrong?"". I said ""you'll just think its stupid and get mad and won't even care."" He said he wouldn't. So I finally just tell him. ""I started jerking you off and you didn't even care. I feel like we incompatable. Like you don't even need me."" ""Oh honey that's not true"" (I wasn't even done talking. I was going to bring up the boob sucking) and he gets up, walks to the other side of the room and turns on the tv. ""uhh what are you doing?"" ""you need this."" and starts flipping through the channels. ""What the fuck are you doing? I wasn't done talking to you and you get up, turn on the tv, and ignore me!"" Now he's mad and turns off the tv and starts to leave. ""what the fuck, I wasn't done talking to you!"". ""Because you're pissing me off!""
""You're doing exactly what I was afraid of. This is why I didn't want to tell you, because you just dismiss me!"" He storms off and I yell ""Don't even bother coming home.""

I get up and go to put my contacts in. He walks in 3 minutes later, says ""I love you"" and shuts the door and finally leaves.

And now I'm just at a loss for words. This escalated so weird and was absolutely retarded. I feel sort of irrational but I knew how he was going to react. He is not the type of person to talk to and I am the type that spills my guts and needs someone to talk to.

I used Nair’s Roll-on Milk and Honey Wax, and the actual hair removal went way better than expected. It didn’t hurt too much, and the skin did not seem overly irritated.   For next several days, I wiped the area down with rubbing alcohol. Fast-forward two weeks, and the hair is starting to grow back in. The area is itchy, red, and there are some bumps that look like whiteheads (presumably ingrowns?) – basically, my bikini line is very unhappy. 

Couple of questions:

-	Is there anything I can do now to alleviate the current situation? I have some TendSkin, and used it yesterday, but it seemed to overdry the area – so now the skin is not only irritated, but also flaky.

-	Is this something I brought upon myself by trying to do this at home?  Or would it have happened even if I went to a salon?

-	What can I do in the future to prevent this from happening again?

So I've been seeing my current boyfriend for almost a year now and we've been having sex for about 7 months, he's the only guy I've ever had sex with. I've had a couple boyfriends before him but they never got to be very serious, mostly because I've always been very self conscious of my body and as a result could never seem to take that next big step with anybody so the relationships ended pretty quick. My body issues definitely come from the fact that I'm a pretty small person, 4'10"", naturally skinny and small boobs. Growing up people always assumed I was several years younger than I was, hell I'm 20 now and just the other day some waitress tried to give me the kid's menu. After awhile these assumptions (not to mention the teasing) can really start to wear you down emotionally and while I've started to feel better about my appearance since starting college, I've still never felt very womanly. 

Well about a year ago my boyfriend entered the picture and immediately I felt more comfortable with him than I had with other guys. He doesn't care about my height (he's no giant himself haha) and he's constantly telling me how pretty he sees me. I just feel comfortable and safe with him, so he's really not a contributing factor to my continued self-consciousness. The problem is that every time I get naked around him I become incredibly aware of my body, especially my breasts and immediately try to cover up. It's really un-sexy. And then when we actually start having sex I just can't fully enjoy it because I'm worrying about my body. The worst is when I start to imagine what I must look like from an outsider's perspective, like some kid having sex, despite the fact that I'm an adult and in no way feel like I'm too immature. I know my hang ups are taking away from our sex life because I can't fully concentrate on what we're doing and I don't feel comfortable to explore further into our sex life. 

The real kicker here is that I'm an incredibly sexual person. I've been exploring my sexuality from a very young age and there's plenty of things I would love to do with him, I love being close to him and there's a fair amount of PDA. Just every time we actually have sex I freeze up because I don't feel confident enough in my body to do anything more. It's incredibly frustrating and I've talked to him about it (not too much, I don't want to make him feel self-conscious too, what a disaster that would be...) and he's always very comforting and tries to reassure me. But it's still hard to get over my body issues. 

I just found this sub and everyone here seems really supportive so I thought I'd just bare it all. I don't know if anyone else has felt this way, or feels this way but any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I went with the intention of getting on BC. While we were going over the options (he didn't really leave me with any), he told me that he was going to prescribe a low-hormone pill. I asked him how long I had to take it before not needing to use a condom, and he said to take it for 2 full months!

I just finished my period the day before my appointment, so it would have been January 6th. Everything I've read has said if you start the pill on the first Sunday after your period (I'm guessing that means the first Sunday that your period ends) you're protected almost immediately, and if not, 7 days is enough time. (The 7 day quote is according to Ortho-Tri-Cyclen's website.)
Now I'm not trying to say my doctor doesn't know what he's talking about, because he *is* a doctor and I'm not. However, 2 months seems really excessive. He told me that I could do it after a month, but added, ""That's if you want to take the risk of pregnancy!""

What do you guys think? Is he full of it, or should I listen and go 2 full months? I don't want to risk pregnancy, but condoms just don't feel the same as skin to skin contact.

I was never one of those girls that could go hours and hours and have sex every single day, but it was never this bad. It only really became a problem with my current partner (boyfriend of ~8 months), though I've been sexually active for 3-4 years. 

Over the past few months I've been suffering stinging when I peed after sex, and general rawness/pain, but I've been able to pinpoint the location to my perineum.

This means that whenever he goes in at a weird angle, I yelp out in pain. This means doggystyle is incredibly tricky, and him spreading my legs or asscheeks apart brings me to tears (pun not intended). It still is possible to avoid hitting that one spot, it just feels like playing minesweeper.

I've tried letting it heal before. I've left it alone for days and weeks. We had sex today for the first time in maybe 2 or 3 weeks, he went it at the wrong angle, and it tore again.

I was at the gyno about a month ago, and I mentioned that sex can be painful sometimes. She noticed inflammation on my cervix, gave me a cream for that and then something for a yeast infection (she said it could be cause by the antibiotic cream -- or she said I already had it -- I wasn't quite sure) and told me I shouldn't be having such rough sex. I figured that would make it all better. It didn't.

Some days are worse than others, but I just can't help but think that all of my partners are looking at it with confusion or that it doesn't turn them on. I actually kind of believe it with my current SO. When I've taken pictures and videos with SOs before, I honestly get mini panic attacks if I have to view them later. I only do it to make them happy (which I like), and I can't really stand looking at myself so I never watch or look at them again. I try to ignore it during sexytimes, but, as you can imagine, it's made it very hard for me to focus on my own orgasm in any position that gives him ""full view"" of it. I'm even considering, once I'm out of college and have money, to get surgery just so I can feel better about myself. If I just promise myself that I'll ""fix it"" one day, I don't feel as bad about my current body issues. It's probably related, but I also have a weird texture fear of feeling the inside of my vag. 

I'm just wondering how to stop feeling this way (so neurotic about my own vagina!) and if anyone deals with something like this?",,False,,t5_2uczz,False,,,True,t3_vvofd,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/vvofd/body_issues_halp/,

I have this problem. On one hand, I know I'm considered attractive. I'm unfairly blessed with big boobs, a little waist, and a heart-shaped butt. I know I have a ""nice vagina"". I know I'm tight. But there's this weird cognitive dissonance. Even though I *know* these things, I can't *feel* them. 

Once in the bedroom my confidence deflates and I get really insecure, but it's hard to explain. It's not like a conscious thought process. It's like a compulsion. I can be completely sure that the guy I am with adores me, my body, my smell, whatever, but I still freeze up. 

I have all these weird little mental blocks. For example, I can't enjoy sitting on a guy's face. I love oral. It's the only way I get off. But I can only enjoy it if I'm lying on my back, with a pillow over my face and a pillow under my butt. When I'm having sex, I can't relax and enjoy it. I get so anxious, that it affects how it feels physically. It's like I involuntarily remove myself from the situation. I get oddly focused on rhythm, but not in a pleasurable way, in a mechanical one. I just feel gross when I'm having sex, even though I know I'm not, and I know the guy I'm fucking doesn't think I am.  

I don't have a history of sexual abuse. I mean, there was one occasion where a high school boyfriend anally violated me while I was incapacitated on Oxycontin and muscle relaxers (I quit using hard drugs after that one), but it's never been something that I've felt really anything about. I was young and stupid and continued dating the guy because I had no idea that what had happened was actually rape. It wasn't until years later that I realized it, and at that point, I wasn't emotionally affected by it. I just have no desire to ever explore anal now. It isn't something that I would ever say haunts me. In fact, I feel rather apathetic about the whole ordeal. 

I have a really high sex drive. I'm almost always turned on. But once I'm actually being intimate with someone, my brain goes all mutiny and takes all the pleasure out of it.

It's not all over inside, just at the top of the opening. There are two reasons I could logically see causing/continuing the pain. 

* I've been on Nuvaring for six months, and recently noticed it sits really low. Right above where the top of the opening is. It's currently my week off it but pain is still really bad.

* My beloved menstrual cup. I think I may have the wrong firmness because it only completely pops open in the c fold.

I have a tiny, hard lump on my vagina, right where my labia minora meets the clitora hood. It's no bigger really than a millimeter or two in width and is slightly more prominent that it is wide and is somewhat whitish in colour.

I've been in a monogamous long distance relationship for a year and a half now, we don't use condoms as I'm on a birth control that I'm very happy with and have been on for years (periods are regular and A-OK). We also both regularly got checked at clinics every 6 months and were always fine, though I haven't been in about a year now and I'm not sure if he has in the last year either. I really don't see how this could be anything sexually transmitted, it may sound naive but he isn't the sort to be unfaithful.

I went to see my GP several times about this about 4 months ago when I first noticed it, but I was also there asking about pain during sex (only suggestions were possible vaginismus and to use more lube - things are getting better in that department). Eventually they told me the lump is most likely a cyst, and that it would most likely go away on it's own if I took lots of hot baths. If not, the only other options were surgical. The thing is I've done a fair about of googling and none of the pictures look like what I have and I'm not entirely convinced he could see what I was talking about during the examination; plus wearing gloves it was probably would have been hard to feel. If anything I think it's gotten slightly larger and sometimes seems quite itchy, but I'm not going to be able to get another appointment until Monday if I'm lucky and I'm freaking out slightly. I'm seeing my partner this weekend but I think I'm going to abstain from sex since it's getting pretty embarassing - if I can feel this tiny hard lump so clearly when masturbating he can definitely feel it with his tongue.

Sorry about the wall of text, has anyone heard of or had anything similar? Am I being totally naive in thinking for so long that this isn't anything serious? I could try and post a picture if anyone thinks it's necessary, but I am going back to my GP asap.

Dealing with it was, of course, difficult.  I spent a few months positively terrified of sex, and then a few months getting drunk and having anonymous sex and telling these strangers all about what happened to me afterwards as a way of coping.  No one around me knew what happened and I had every intention of keeping it that way.  And then I lost interest in that, and started actually trying to *meet* someone.  And I thought, hey, this must be a good sign, eh?

And then I met someone, and its sort of developed into a mostly sexual relationship.  At first it was great.  And having sex with the same person more than once was just *fantastic*.  But last night for whatever reason, I kept on having really intense flashbacks, and *could not* get into it.  Despite a very valiant effort on his part, I wasn't able to finish and he seemed really upset by that.  I kept on thinking that I had to tell him, but the words just wouldn't come, and I ended up not being able to sleep because every time I started to doze off I'd have really awful nightmares and wake up shaking.

So then, he wanted to give it another shot this morning.  Same thing, which was no surprise to me since everything was even more fresh on my mind after spending a sleepless night kicking myself for not talking to him about it.  So, I told him.

The thing is, now I'm scared to have sex.  This is the first time anything like this has happened and I have no idea what triggered it or how to avoid it, and I feel like if I'm scared it'll keep happening then it definitely *will* happen.   I'm also scared he'll be constantly nervous that *that's* what I'm thinking about and I'm just not saying anything because he seems into it and I don't want to ruin it for him.  Now I'm scared that I just broke a big emotional barrier and our ""mostly just sexual"" relationship can't be ""mostly just sexual"" anymore.

I am in desperate need of advice/help regarding my sex life. Here's a little background about me:

21/F, have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 6 years (high school sweethearts). We were both each others' ""first"", so neither of us has lots of experience that would come from having multiple partners. When I was younger I would feel horny very often, and everything was new an exciting when we would fool around. The problem is that now almost never feel horny. I feel so awful because we don't have sex very often and I know that he wants to. Part of the problem is that I can't figure out how to make sex feel good.

I have a vibrator (Hitachi magic wand - I've tried other toys with less intense vibration and these rarely work) and I can easily orgasm with this on my own. I've tried using it with my boyfriend, but I find that when I'm masturbating and trying to get off, I have to concentrate and I tense up my body. If my boyfriend is touching me while I do this, I feel like I need to relax my body and I lose whatever tension I've built up. It takes me FOREVER to orgasm manually, and I tend to get really frustrated because often I can get right to the brink but not ""over the edge"" and it's very tiring so I don't really like to do this.

Actual penetration does not feel good to me. In fact, it tends to hurt after only a short while (even with lube and no condom). We've tried tons of positions and I can't find anything that stimulates my clitoris while were having sex. Direct manual stimultion of my clit often does not feel very good (if I'm masturbating manually I sort of position my hand ""above"" the external region of my clit, if that makes sense), so I've never had luck trying to rub my clit while we're having sex. Fingers just seem to be too firm and deliver too much intense pressure for it to feel good.

I tend to feel really self conscious when my boyfriend is eating me out, which I realize is just my issue. But I can't seem to just relax and enjoy it. Also, it's not as if my boyfriend has had tons of practice on other women, and I honestly have no idea how to direct him about how to do it well. Even when I tell him to use more pressure, it still doesn't feel like enough pressure and doesn't really get me very far.


So that's basically where I'm at. Any advice or tips from people who may have had similar issues would be most appreciated!

My experience with it has been that I (the woman) have been expected to buy it, but it doesn't make sense that the woman should have to pay to protect herself when it is technically the man's misfire. If the condom breaks, that's an entirely different story, but if he just doesn't pull out in time, what's a girl to do? Especially one who's short on funds. Is it kosher to split the cost? And is there a difference between how you would approach the situation in a one night stand scenario vs a long term relationship? I guess there is no right answer, I was wondering what the general opinion of this was. 

It probably makes a difference that I'm currently in a long-term relationship and always pay for condoms and prescription bc pills. I've paid for Plan B about 3 times, one because the condom broke and twice because my boyfriend just, uh, lost it too early. It would be helpful to add that in there because I wouldn't actually be asking this question if it were a one-time thing, but I'm not looking for specific advice. So... 

tl;dr: The morning-after pill. Who pays for it?

The medical group I have is Catholic based, and the original doctor that put my first one in (sadly) died of a heart attack.

I'm not sure of the specifics, but the doctor I was seeing had to refer me to a ""specialist"" in order to start the process of getting me an IUD. (Can I just say the doctor that referred me didn't know what a DivaCup or Soft Cup was? I wish I had the option of having a female doctor...). Before the first doctor referred me, however, he said he'd get back to me when he got info on the specialist. He didn't get back to me for several weeks. I ended up calling his office, talked with a nurse to remind him about me, and I finally received a letter in the mail letting me know I had officially been referred, and that I can contact the IUD inserting office.

I called the number on the paper, and the nice nurse/office assistant let me know that the IUD inserting doctor also worked at another office if I wanted to see him on a Saturday. This was a lovely surprise, because I didn't want to have to take any time off of work to see him. I made sure that the other office was also covered under my referral, and that they took my insurance, and got off the phone with the very helpful lady on the other end.

I called the number for the weekend office, and was abruptly told that, ""No, we do not take your insurance!"" and was nearly hung up on. I called the helpful lady back, who laughed, and said she'd call the weekend office and have a talk with them. I waited about 10 minutes, then called the weekend office again, and the same abrupt lady at the other end was very short with me, to the point where I couldn't understand her for a moment, and she snapped at me to tell her my birth date. Finally made an appointment for a Saturday.

The Saturday arrives and I make my way into the office. I printed the necessary papers off and filled them beforehand, and was all set. I handed the papers to a young woman behind the counter, noticing there was an older, annoyed sounding woman answering phone calls further back in the office behind the counter. I'm pretty sure that's the woman that answered my original call...

Finally get called back after waiting a quick 5 minutes or so. Got pulled back into an area with a woman and her children that had seats, a scale, and some other office equipment. The nurse told me to I step on the scale, and I make an overt gesture to turn my head away, because I don't like knowing my weight. She reads my weight out loud, which startles me, because of the woman and her children sitting within touching distance of me standing on the scale. Okay... Then the nurse starts asking me personal information, like last menstrual cycle... I don't really want to share that information with the other woman and her children, and before I stutter the answer out, another nurse walks by and tells us my room is ready.

I wait in the room briefly before the doctor comes in. He tries to sell me on getting the Minera, but I tell him I've done hormones before and can NOT do hormones at all. It makes me a completely different person (a very mean and insane person), and I'm very easily affected by even the smallest amount of caffeine. He still tries to sell me on it, saying it'll be easier to get the medical group to approve it, because I can use the excuse that I'm using it for menstrual regulation, rather than straight up birth control, but I stick to my guns, and he says okay. Finally, he drops me off at the front desk, saying he'll put in the request.

The nice young nurse at the front says they'll call me in two Saturdays. I say okay and leave.

Fast forward to 4 Saturdays later, still no call. I decide to call them during their posted hours, and no one answers. I leave a message with my name and number. Wait another week. They're closed every other Saturday, so I call during the week while they're open. The young lady that answers tells me that the woman who usually puts in the IUD orders has been on vacation... So I ask the woman on the other end of the phone if I should call back in a few more weeks. She says no, they'll call me.

It's now been about 3 months since the time to doctor said he'd put in the order. No calls. I'm getting very frustrated with the office and their unprofessional ways. I also feel stuck, because I have such a restrictive medical group as my PCP. I have no idea if I should keep calling back, keep getting frustrated... Or change my PCP (I have no idea where to start with that, I just went with the PCP my mom had signed up for several years ago) which will take about a month for the insurance to change. Any suggestions how to find a medical group that will let me get a copper IUD? Are there any sites that have that info?

TL;DR: Mostly a rant. But I'd love to know where I can go to get an IUD without having to jump through a half a year of hoops. I DON'T want to get pregnant.

I actually used to think I was asexual as recently as a year ago.  I actually saw a sex therapist once I decided I wasn't.  Her verdict was that I ""turned my sexuality off"" as a child (note:  no abuse involved, just indoctrination) and need to catch up by practicing on myself.  The common wisdom appears to be that women need to masturbate to ""learn about themselves"" before being sexually active with a partner.  (I lost my virginity to my SO about 4 months ago, and have been having regular sex since.  However, I've never orgasmed before, but really want to.  But I at least know I can get aroused when we touch each other.)

Sooo...  back to the point of the question.  I'm having trouble masturbating because I can't seem to get turned on by anything.  I've seen some porn, but it doesn't seem to do much for me.  Its like I don't have enough sexual empathy or something.  I can't project myself into the scenarios.  They're ""other people"" I don't really care about.  Porn just seem kind of staged for the most part.  *Any* sort of bad acting, corny sex phrase, even tattoos instantly take me out of whatever immersion I had.  I think some might make me feel a little tight down there, but not turned on enough to feel anything good.  Same goes for short stories I've tried.  

It's making me worried that I'm somehow crippled in the ""fantasy"" department.  I can't seem to have found any kind of kink or scenario to get me going.  This is especially weird/frustrating to me because I'm very imaginative in all other aspects of my life.  My career revolves around my creativity.

So a little background on me....I'm a 22F and this past school year, I met a guy who is 19M. He is totally awesome and I really like him. We've already started casually dating and I really see us going somewhere. There's just a teensy problem.

He's a virgin.

With literally everything. I was the first girl to hold his hand, kiss him, sleep in the same bed with him, etc.

The first time we kissed though, it was pretty bad. We were drunk and were cuddling in bed and he initiated a kiss but missed and ended up on my chin. I laughed it off and kissed him back but then I realized that he had no idea what he was doing. I thought it was just the alcohol and continued to kiss him. I started touching him and felt that he had a solid rock hard boner and so I inched my way down and was about to undo his belt when I noticed that he was shaking a little. Again, I thought it was just the alcohol. So I started giving him a bj but after a couple minutes, I realized that he was shaking....alot. I asked him if he was alright and he assured me that he was but yet he still continued to shake and tremble. It was very off putting. That's when he revealed to me that it was his first time doing anything with a girl. I let him explore my body and he seemed really into it but I could tell that the whole situation made him really nervous.

A week after that happened, we found ourselves having another sleep over. We made out and I tried to give him a bj but his nerves were still there and he was unable to cum. I encouraged him to masturbate in front of me and he was able to cum through that.

For about a month now we've just been hanging out and kissing but nothing else because i'm kind of unsure how to proceed. I've never been with someone so inexperienced and I want to make his first time amazing.

Anyway, I have never had the opportunity to look at someone else's hairs properly long enough to figure out if I'm normal or not. But as long as I can remember, my pubic hair has always grown in with two or three (sometimes even four) hairs per follicle. I'm not sure if this means they are in-grown. It doesn't usually cause me any discomfort, except when I shave and it grows back. It's just horribly uncomfortable, and I get a lot of weird red bumps, that sometimes appear to be pimples, that then have the hairs sometimes growing sideways or up and then back down into the skin, meaning I have to spend some time with a pair of tweezers getting the hair back out in order to stop the discomfort. 

Like I said, I've never been sure if this is just how pubic hair is supposed to behave, or I am just super unlucky. But does anyone else have the same problem? Or is there anyway I can fix this (or at least find a better way to deal with the discomfort and in-growns after shaving)?

He seemed apprehensive, so I dropped the subject. At one point, he did try it, but it was very rare that he does, and I don't push it on him. I on the other hand didn't really mind going down on him, and would do so a little more often than he did as long as he was okay with it. However, the last time he did go down on me was really embarrassing.  I always make it a point to shower before sex, especially so it would be easier for him to go down on me if he decided that he was going to. But, it was not enough for him, and he had gone to the kitchen, wet a paper towel, and literally started cleaning me! I was so upset and embarrassed- I asked him why on earth he'd do that, and he admitted he just doesn't like the taste. He felt really awful. I can't really blame him all that much, I understand some guys don't like to give oral sex because of taste or smell. I forgave him for it, but I told him that we really should try to be more communicative about what we like or don't like when it comes to sex, especially since I really would not have minded if he didn't want to do that sort of thing because of that reason. 

Fast forward to last week: there had been some issues between us about communication (in general), so we sat down and tried to talk, and the subject of sex came up.  I tried to broach the subject again with him, and that was when he confessed to me that he really didn't enjoy receiving oral sex very much. I was very hurt when he brought it up- I don't want to feel like I'm forcing him into anything.  I asked him why he didn't tell me this before, and he said he'd feel bad otherwise. So I asked him what exactly about it he didn't like, and his answer was that it feels painful for him when he's close to coming. It's news to me, that I've ever brought him to that point- but then again, he hardly communicates with me about what he likes.  

I thought I could handle not receiving oral sex, but not being able to give him oral sex? Am I wrong for being a little hurt by this?  I also had felt a small part of me still wants to include oral sex, but I don't want to be selfish, and I want to make him happy.  He's a sweetheart and I know he would try to make me happy- he has tried- but I don't want to make him uncomfortable in the process either.

My Birth Control regimen has fluctuated this past year because, well, I need to be on SOMETHING to curb the ""amipregnantamipregnant"" anxiety episodes. 

Around April I began Apri28, and promptly went off it in a week when I had unnatural suicidal thoughts.

When I returned to my gyno, she gave me three packs of Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo, which did wonders for my mood swings, but I had my period for over two months. SO. They took me off of that.

This all began after I stopped taking OTCL, so basically I have barely had sex since late summer. Mid-November I picked back up again with Emoquette.

So I've always been pretty into my body and trying out new things. Right now, my favorite thing to use is my bullet vibrator and masturbating in the shower. 

Well, tonight I was studying for finals and getting very sick of doing math problems, so I decided that it was completely excusable to use masturbating as a form of procrastination. But, I thought to myself, how could I improve my procrasturbating? 

I've always been interested in squirting, so I looked it up for a bit and thought, 'Fuck, I could do that.'

So, fast forward, in the shower with a vibrator and all that jazz, it was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. I think I did squirt, but it wasn't the geyser I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, it felt awesome, but I wasn't even sure that I did it. It felt like I peed just a bit.

Boyfriend has been gone a while and I've finally figured out a good technique for orgasming with just my hands! (I haven't quite warmed up to the idea of using any sort of foreign object, the idea still weirds me out but I'll get there eventually. I don't even use tampons if that gives people an idea of how uncomfortable I am with them)


1) I think I'm orgasming too much. Is it normal to do it like 6/7 times in one sitting??? I could def go for more but after that much time and stuff I just feel like I should probly be doing something more productive.


2) When I orgasm with my boyfriend (from actual sex) it feels similar but I come WAY more with him (as in, not nearly as much fluid when I orgasm by myself). I always thought that women can't come (well, until I orgasmed with my boyfriend the first time) but I'm still really hazy on the details surrounding it.


3) When I'm done with my ""alone time"" I usually have to pee REALLY bad. Is this because all those fluids are ""built up?"" (again, my ignorance on the subject is glaringly obvious here) Also, afterwards I feel like an infection is brewing down there but I think it could just be from all of the...friction? I always make sure I pee afterwards and I feel a little better in terms of feeling like I need to piss my pants but I'm just kinda worried about everything.


4) Another weird thing that happens is this shooting pulse sensation that starts halfway down my calves and pulses down to the middle of my feet, and then when the ""pulse"" gets to my feet, my feet tingle for a second as if they were just asleep. This goes on for 10-20 minutes after my alone time, and I can't recall it ever happening with my boyfriend. Is this something I should be worried about?

I didn't have any burning sensations or more pain when I peed and a week later we had sex and there wasn't any pain. I was really scared because I didn't know what was wrong but now I feel I have a bigger problem: I don't feel sexually attracted to my boyfriend anymore. Or men at all for that matter. I even thought that I could be homosexual now but the thought of not being with my boyfriend and not being able to feel the way I did about him before terrifies me. We've been together for nine months and our relationship is great and I don't want to leave him. Has this happened to anyone else before? Is the pain I had connected with my confusing feelings about my boyfriend? Thanks to any responses!

I woke up to a dull ache in my vagina and the sensation of mild menstrual cramps.

Is this normal? The cramping sensation surprised me the most, why would my uterus be affected? Or is that sensation from hitting the cervix?

I don't masturbate by hand, I ball up a blanket and grind against it on my bed. Today, I did just that, but instead of letting myself finish I rolled over, pulled off my panties and examined myself, and sure enough my clitoris was red and erect, and it finally clicked.

However, I still have a problem. I don't masturbate by hand because I  have never found it pleasurable whatsoever. Sometimes, in fact, I find it bothersome. When my boyfriend touches me, it feels amazing, but when I touch myself I feel nothing pleasurable or I feel discomfort. When I found my clitoris today, I tried touching it, but as I expected it hurt just a bit. I'm not concerned as much about that because I know that direct clitoral stimulation can be too much for the sensitivity of it, but I guess my question is why do I feel nothing when I touch myself, but when my boyfriend does it, it feels good?

I wouldn't be concerned with masturbating, but I want to make myself orgasm without having to grind. The only way I've found myself able to orgasm with my boyfriend is when I grind against him in a similar fashion to how I grind against a blanket.

My boyfriend and I are both each other's first sexual partner, and we're both 20 if that somehow makes a difference.

Then I do the awkward shuffle and try to get the rest out. 



What I've come to realize (loooool come) through random Googling today, is that this is probably due to the fact that he cums A LOT. Average is apparently 1.5 teaspoons? I'd estimate it's more like 2 tablespoons for him, minimum. Is that even healthy? It makes clean up so difficult. Is there any way at all that I can make clean up easier is basically my question.

I have sex with my boyfriend, despite minor irritation in the beginning it goes smoothly. If I wait too long it ends up hurting again (I think because I end up getting less wet). By the end it was hurting and I was ready to stop, but overall It was great sex.

I recently met and amazing guy on OkCupid and we hit it off after only one week of dating(started messaging on Sunday, went out M,W,F, Sa,Su).  We talk about anything and everything, are totally in sync when it comes to life goals, family, passions, etc and have discussed sex at length. *However* I'm worrying myself sick about telling him that I have HSV-2. Sometimes when we talk I'm like 'I know he's so in to me that he'll be cool with it and accept and care about me.' and other days I'm just like 'OMFG he's going to reject me and I've already started to care about him!'

I know that if he does end things because I tell him it wasn't meant to be but it's so difficult to not disclose this too early. Like I'm definitely not planning to have sex with him for a few weeks atleast(much to his dismay) but I *really, really* want to make sure that he's someone that I can tell and should tell. It's so hard sometimes because I know that I have alot to offer but finding out that I have this has made me more self conscious and definitely more of a worrywart.

i'm a f19, and lately i've been getting pretty involved with this guy. the problem is, i'm having issues staying wet. We'll do some foreplay, and then start.

Help?,no_thx_fr_th_mmrs,5,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/1a2iyo/intrusive_memories_during_sex_help/,"Background: About four years ago, I (F/26 at the time) started hooking up with another woman and her husband. I only had sex with the woman, but her husband participated sometimes. Long story short, he is very unattractive to me, like the complete opposite of what I find attractive, and even though I never fucked him or even touched him, I am super grossed out by the memories of those experiences. I did it because it was the only way to be with the woman at that time... which I know was not very smart, but it happened. But for goodness sake, I've been *assaulted* in the past and not had any problems with flashbacks or memories, but this? What the hell? I always had issues with it from the time it was happening, but it never really affected me in any significant way until recently.

Fast forward four years through an almost-relationship and subsequent parting of ways between myself and the woman, I am suddenly (and by suddenly, I mean within the last couple months) having flashbacks to the times we were with the husband. Thinking about him and the fact that I participated in that literally makes me cringe. I have a lot of experience and have done some pretty crazy shit, but I have never felt grossed out by anything sexual I've experienced before or since this. Random things trigger the memories, but it happens almost every time I have sex now. It doesn't matter who I'm with or what I'm doing, for some reason those memories pop into my head and there goes my ladyboner. It seems to happen less when I'm doing the work, going down on another girl or giving head or fucking a guy... or a combination, whatever I can do to stay busy I guess. But if someone's goin' down on me, which *used* to be the best thing ever, 99% chance that shit is popping in my head.

At first I tried more sex, but now it's gotten to the point where, even though I still enjoy sex, I dread those inevitable memories so much that it's hard for me to even get excited about it. I've talked to a friend about it, and she gave me a few suggestions, and I've also been reading books and articles on intrusive thoughts. However, those are more geared towards OCD and haven't been super helpful as of yet.

Because of my job and the fact that I live in an area where there aren't a whole lot of mental health professionals, I know every therapist in the area or they know of me. There is no way in hell I could talk about this with another professional that I already know or would potentially work with in the future. I'm trying to avoid having to drive 50 miles to another area to get this shit fixed. So, has anyone else experienced this, basically regretting being intimate with someone and not being able to scrub it out of your brain to the point where it can potentially ruin all your sexual experiences?

We take turns wearing and receiving, and we use condoms for extra lubrication/cleanliness. (STIs aren't a concern as we've both been tested and are monogamous.) 

This hasn't been an issue till tonight. We tried a new position (with me receiving), and after a bit of trial and error it was lovely. 

During an interlude I noticed my vagina felt kind of tender. I thought it was just soreness from the penetration (that happens when things get intense and it doesn't bother me). There was also a kind of burning/stinging sensation that I don't associate with penetration normally. In fact it reminded me a bit of how warming lube feels. 

Then my girlfriend started to go down on me and stopped because her mouth felt weird...I think she described it as a numb or tingly feeling. She also noticed my labia were unusually hot to the touch.

So she rinsed her mouth out and I sponged off with some water and a washcloth, and we went on to even better things. Without the strap-on this time. 

I'd like to find out what the problem is, though, to avoid encountering it again. This is where you all come in. Anyone had a similar experience with condoms/lube penetrative sex? I don't have any symptoms besides the pain/stinging/heat, so I really doubt it's a latex allergy. I thought we'd used this type of condom before, but I'm not 100% sure so maybe the brand is the problem. They aren't anything crazy, just Planned Parenthood Basics. 

I'm thinking for now we'll just stick to different condom brands or go without, but I'm curious to see if anyone else has encountered this, or spots something I am missing.

He had me in a position where I was on my back and legs up in the air. It didn't hurt being in the position, I'm not really flexible, so I wouldn't stay in the position if it hurt. But I'm pretty sore. It hurts my walk.

Is it because I'm ""out-of-shape"" (haven't been fingered in awhile) or the position? My butt and thighs are sore.

I don't know what to do.,hello_flamingo,15,12,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/1el0n0/my_relationship_is_stagnant_and_sexual_things/,"Hello everyone, I'm a confused and upset eighteen year old looking for advice. This is probably going to be a long wall of text, but if you could hear me out I'd be so grateful.

First some background info: my boyfriend is also eighteen and we have been dating a year. We have never done very much sexually because I have always held back/pushed him away. I love him, but I don't think I am in love with him. 

Lately, we've been having some relationship issues. I know this isn't the subreddit to ask about that so I'll focus on the sex side of it. I decided to write this post because yesterday something happened and I need to address it. Yesterday after school, we went on a date, the first one we've been on in nearly a month. Everything went great, it was very casual, I think we both enjoyed it. But when we stopped at his house afterwards it went downhill. We had twenty minutes to kill before going to see a play with friends, so we went up to his room (the first time we were alone) and right away he's kissing me, reaching his hands up my shirt and down the back of my shorts, etc. He's done this before I and have mentioned it makes me uncomfortable. This time, like every other time, I kiss him back a little but try to end things as soon as possible. After we leave to go to the play he acts differently. For the first time, he is obviously upset that I rejected his advances. He does not act as warmly to me as he usually does, but I don't know if it's because he's hurt/annoyed/what have you. I didn't get a chance to talk to him after the play, either. I texted him, but he said he was fine and wouldn't reply after that.

I'm upset that he's upset, and that I caused him to be unhappy, and I'm also upset that sexual things make me uncomfortable to the point it's putting strain on my relationship. I don't know if I want to take things further with him. If I do, I don't know how I could make myself more comfortable, or how to enjoy it. I'm also wondering if I should let the relationship fizzle out on its own (seeing as we'll be going to different colleges next year), and try with someone else who might be a better match for me.

Either way, I want to be more comfortable with everything sex-related. Not just being sexual, but being able to talk about it and think about it without feeling nervous or embarrassed.  I know I have trouble opening up and communicating and I want to change that. Everything's a bit of a mess right now, I'm still trying to sort it all out.

I've been to the doctor several times, but she just gave me some meds for the overactive bladder and sent me home.

So, background,
I was on the pill for about a year, came off it about a year ago (kept forgetting to take it, kept losing my pills, on and off antibiotics frequently, kept forgetting to get refills on time, hated having periods). I was hormone contraceptive free for a few months (used condoms though) but then, after hearing rave reviews from friends and my nurse decided to try the depo injection, it seemed like the perfect choice, 3 times a year, free, no periods etc.
All was well until about 6/7/8 weeks into the first when i started bleeding (as if having a period), waited until next injection time, had it, bleeding stopped, but started again. Anyway long story short since being on depo I've had frequent bleeding (more than what i'd call 'spotting') combined with period like pain in my uterus, and I often have very dark discharge (like dark brown/rust coloured) anytime within 3 - 12 weeks after injection. I had 4 so far (next due in august), the nurse tells me some bleeding is normal and keeps moving injections up (my last was at 10 weeks) but still no change, is this normal? Is there another form of hormone based contraceptive that would be better suited? Im really fed up of this, and in a lot of pain atm.

TL;DR Started depo injection 10 months ago, since then frequent bleeding and period like pains, is this normal, will it settle down over time or should i try another form of contraception?",,False,,t5_2uczz,False,,,True,t3_vt3ck,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/vt3ck/my_turn_to_ask_about_contraception_problems/,

I keep telling him not to worry because we're both new to sex and it's obviously not going to be perfect straightaway and not be annoyed or angry at himself because I'm not. Its like if he feels he does one thing wrong he gets embarrassed and then goes soft.

We were making out and things progressed a little further than normal and he was using the head of his penis to stimulate my clit. I remember clearly that he did not penetrate or ejaculate but I'm worried about pre-cum or maybe that he slipped (which is unlikely because I didn't feel him go any deeper than the external parts of my vagina). All this happened about a month ago- around June 22nd. 

My period was supposed to start 6 days ago and I've been having PMS symptoms (bloating, sore boobs, fatigue etc) and it keeps feeling like my period's going to start but it doesn't. I know that the chances are slim but I've been FREAKING out about all this. We aren't in a serious relationship and I come from a super conservative family. I don't know how I would get away with getting an abortion under my parents' nose. Looking things up online just makes it worse because I am a virgin and this would be so unfortunate especially because I'm taking a major test in September and I really can't afford my life going to hell right now. 

I know the best thing to do is take a pregnancy test to ease my mind and worry later but I've never done that before. I just feel really guilty, pathetic and sad. If anyone with similar experience or advice could help out I would really appreciate it. 

TL;DR I made out naked. There was no penetration but his penis was around my vagina. My period's been late and I've been worried. Not sure if I'm freaking out for no reason.

I love love love getting him off by whatever means (bjs, vagina-penis sex, etc) and so when we're fooling around, I'm usually the one to initiate things. When he goes down on me, I usually soon after, either go down on him, or hop on and ride, or lie on my back. anyway, i'm almost always quick to switch from being pleasured to pleasuring him. 

He, on the other hand, is not like that. If I go down on him first, usually after, we just cuddle (which is nice, but, y'know, we could do that after im done too) and then he doesn't goes down on me (we just end up falling asleep or doing something else.) I can understand if we have v-p sex first, and he cums in me, then he doesn't want to do down on me (I don't want to suck his dick after it's been in me, same idea.) But I just don't see how he could love to pleasure me but then not do it nearly as often as I do it to him. 

I always feel awkward asking him to go down on me. I don't want him to do it because he feels like he has to, I want him to do it because he wants to. I think he might not even be aware of what he's doing (or not doing.) I think he might just be in that after-orgasm daze every time he doesn't reciprocate, where you just want to lie down and cuddle. Sometimes, though, I feel like he is aware that he's not reciprocating, and most of the time I think it's because of hair.

So my question is: how do i communicate to him that I want him to reciprocate every time? That I feel like he isn't always caring for my sexual needs? I don't want him to feel bad, though. 

TL;DR: I always make an effort to get my boyfriend off anytime we're fooling around, but he doesn't always do the same.

He then pulled some, 'every girl only uses me for my looks. No one wants to get to know me because Im not as intelligent' thing and roped me in. I tried to help and he told me that I could help by giving him company if I come over. I agree on the condition that he gives me oral sex [I know, Im terrible]. He told me, ""i might as well"". and I agreed and came over. We had sex and after he looks at me and says that I could leave since my job was done. 

At first, I was infuriated. You owe me oral, bitch. He told me, he never really agreed to it. Said, 'he might' not that he will. I got up, got my clothes back on and left immediately. He kept telling me how he was proud of me for standing up for myself and some more fresh bull shit.

The drive back home, I couldn't help but feel like Kristen Wig from bridesmaids. I can't believe I let this happen to me. I feel used, and dirty and pretty much like I'm just some sex toy.
