A lot of power users complain that Mission Control is not like Spaces.  Let me make a few specific points and suggestions.  Multiple displays are effectively broken with Mission Control.  The following three points are the most serious, followed by a fourth at the bottom, which is less serious:

- Mission Control shows each display's desktop icon on its own screen, but does not show the overall multi-display layout as a unit.  The user must mentally associate the icons on one Mission Control display with those on the other.  This is practically impossible and requires ""counting"" in from the left or right while continuously flashing one's eyes back and forth to try to make sense of the situation.  This is a disaster.  A better design would have Mission Control show something that resembles the Display System Preferences Arrangement panel, where the multiple displays are shown with their respective spatial arrangement as a unit (I believe Spaces did this!!!).  That is what should be shown in Mission Control, perhaps only on the main display or perhaps duplicated on both displays so that both displays are effectively clones in Mission Control.  This is the single biggest failing of Mission Control and you should take this recommendation seriously.  10.7 is too old and has undergone too many revisions at this point for this design to have continued for so long.

- Mission Control is incompatible with reassigning windows across the multi-display divide.  The user-interaction almost works.  One can drag a window to the other display and even ""shrink"" it into one of the desktop icons at the top, but when the mouse button is released, the interaction fails and the window pops back to its original location.  This is horrible.  The interaction shouldn't even pretend like it's going to work if it's going to fail at the last second.  Obviously, the correct fix is to leave the interaction alone (it works fine) and actually support the underlying window-to-desktop reassignment.

- Spaces permitted one to drag window icons from one space to another.  Mission Control only allows this from the current desktop to other desktops.  There is no way to move window icons from the desktops out to the current desktop display, nor is there a way to drag window icons between the various desktop icons while neither is necessarily the current desktop.  Both interactions need to be supported in order for Mission Control to be fully useful.

- Lastly, the two-dimensional display of Spaces was tremendously helpful because the desktop views could be quadratically larger than in Mission Control, thus easing the visual-mental challenge of recognizing each space or desktop.

I sincerely hope you will take this matter seriously.  Considering how old 10.7 is, I'm pretty disappointed these issues have not yet been resolved.

Thank you.

You have three color options: graphite, dark grey and blue (a little more pale than default ML blue) and others changes in ML interface.

Installation is modular so you can install just what you like.

Also you can find themes for last iTunes version.

Also I recommend to check Gpopper blog where you can find other wonderful gems for changing osx appearance like this pale background for Notes App that I love

I'm temporarily using a Windows machine because my old Linux PC died recently, but the complete lack of a (proper) terminal is more annoying than anything. I also develop in Python and it is just horrible.

While I'm more than comfortable with Linux, I'm also somewhat bored of putting together a machine and configuring everything (used to use Arch linux, because distributions like Ubuntu are full of bloat) etc.

So that pretty much leaves OS X, but I don't know just how terminal friendly it is. Can I do everything (or at least, most of what) I can do on Linux? ie. write scripts to automate things, install from terminal, move around or search for files etc?

I have about 130gb of music, I could slim it down a bit, but honestly I would like to keep a great majority of it because I'm a bit of an audiophile (and I actually *have* listened to all of it).

I've been considering the new rMBP and am aware that I'll probably end up with the 256gb SSD and I don't want to be constricted on space right after transferring all my files over. So my plan is to move my library to my WD Elements 1TB external and have access to my music whenever I'm connected to my sound system. Can anyone who does this or has tried it comment on any issues I might be bothered with? For starters, the external disk spinning up always stalls the entire system and I'm not sure how often it will do that if I'm listening to music all day. There is also the issue of constantly moving new music from downloads to the external drive (which may be resolved by a program called hazel, still tinkering with it).

So once again, if anyone has done this I'd like to hear opinions to see if it is worth doing or not.",,False,,t5_2qh3j,False,,,True,t3_vpeln,http://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/vpeln/does_anyone_keep_their_itunes_music_library_on_an/,

Never mind running a WinXP VM with 1GB of RAM, which will usually result in minute-long thrashing when switching back to another app.

I'm running an i7 2.93 GHz Quad-Core with 4 GB of RAM. Here's a screenshot of System Monitor:

http://i.imgur.com/7MIG5z2.png

As you can see OS X is reporting 3.95 GB of used physical memory, as well as 1.55 GB of swap space, but looking at the running apps I hardly get to 3GB in total. Sometimes the used swap is even several GBs bigger, without any real change in the apps I'm running. I won't even mention the ridiculous VM size, since that metric seems to be mostly meaningless anyway, but I still think it's maybe a bit *too* high?

I'm especially confounded because I run the exact same stuff on my Linux desktop at home, which is at least 3 years older but has also 4 GB RAM, and there I barely ever see the swap space get touched at all.

Is there anything I can do to diagnose this issue? Or is it simply ""normal"" because this machine went through 2 OS updates and wasn't reinstalled since Snow Leopard?

So I followed this guide:

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4897066?start=0&amp;tstart=0

You'll need a windows 7 disc.

If that guide's down, here's a text mirror:

**================ START  MIRROR ================**

* Gather your Windows 8 install disc AND a Windows 7 install disc (you can surely find one by searching the net, use your old one, or borrow a colleagues... we are licensing Windows 8, NOT 7, this is just for my trick to fool bootcamp assistant and no i do not condone piracy)
* Inside BootCamp Assistant, the driver download may hang,it did for me, twice..could be heavy usage due to the popular new update...so i recommend downloading it faster, and manually here http://support.apple.com/downloads/#macoscomponents  and get 4.1.4586  yes this is for windows 7, ALSO while you are there, download the windows 8 support pack 5.0.5033, as we will need that later as well.  As a matter of fact, DO IT THIS WAY and dont bother
* That being said and done, in BootCamp Assistant (OSX), only check off Install Windows 7, leaving the download support software unchecked
* Partition your hard drive as youd like, this splits up your storage space however you like, keep in mind which OS you plan to run the most, and obviously give that one more room, i.e you do all your Photoshop work, and app development in OSX, and only use Windows for office stuff, you'd want to give yourself more room on the OSX side.  I however bought a huge new internal drive to split them basically in half, as i use them both frequently.
* This step is where the trick comes.  OSX 10.8.3 / BootCamp will advise you there is no support for Windows 8..only 7 with your Mid 09 Macbook Pro if you have put your Windows 8 disc in, upsetting you as it did me...possibly bringing you to this post, thats not FAIR is it?  Your 09 MacBook Pro is still JUST AS GOOD as a lot of PC's running Windows 8, why they excluded this model i have no idea...im sure they had reasons, but i dont care at the moment..lol

* INSTEAD place a Windows 7 install disc in, and click next.  BootCamp Assistant will now partition your drive, make the windows side bootable and restart your  MBP.
* Let it do its thing, and eventually you will land at the Windows 7 installation interface.  We don't really want that, we want Windows 8 right? 
* Click the ""x"" to close the installation for Windows 7, it threatens your MBP will restart, and allow it to do so.

* **IMPORTANT**  Once you hear the beloved Mac chime, quickly press and hold the ""option"" key.
* This brings you to an area where you can select a startup disk.  At this point, lets get rid of the trick.  Hit your eject button and get rid of the Windows 7 install disc, we are done with it now.
* You now, well in my case anyway, should only see your Mac HD, and the Recovery Disk. 
* Insert your Windows 8 install disc

* Now WAIT.  Eventually, you should see a new DVD looking icon that says Windows pop up next to the MacHD and Recovery Disk.  (depending on what you called your iso, it may something else...not sure, but you cant miss the new entry)
* This is where a wired mouse will be needed, or use tab/space/enter to navigate to the new Windows Disc icon and launch it.
* You are now in Windows 8's installation interface, cool!
* Follow the steps until it asks you where you want to install it.  You should see a partition about equal to what you set earlier in BootCamp Assistant, and it SHOULD say Bootcamp right on it.  Select this partition.  (mine was the last one, the fourth i believe)

* OH NO, it says you cant install it to that partition, this is normal.  You need to highlight/select this partition, and click format.  I cant remember, but i think you have to click ""options"" to get to a the spot where you can format it.  Pretty straight forward.  Safety check, obviously make sure you have the Bootcamp partition selected, dont format your Mac OSX partition!
* After the quick format is done, Windows 8 installer will then allow you to click ""next"" and from there the magic happens.
* Go through the whole Windows 8 install, and setup how you would like, this takes awhile, and im not covering that, as its a hand in hand walkthrough like any other install.

* Once your inside your new Windows 8, you'll see a bunch of things not working, like tap to click on your trackpad, no on screen displays for brigtness, volume, and possibly other stuff.  Not cool right? 
* Grab your USB stick, or Burnt disc that you applied the bootcamp support downloads to in the begining of this tutorial.
* FIRST open the Windows 7 Bootcamp install, 4.1.4586, open the folder and find setup.exe and run it (we are in windows 8 now)
* It takes a while, but Apple's BootCamp will install a bunch of drivers, etc, and eventually restart your MBP, which is cool, let it do it.

* Upon finishing, lets go back to the USB/Burnt Disc where all your support software was saved, and lets get the newly support BootCamp 5.0.5033 opened up.
* Big Thanks to a post by ErikVanD i seen on this forum for the next step.
* If you want, try and click setup in this latest BootCamp support set, and you will get another sad error claiming x64 is not supported, something awful to that nature.  Awww man, this far, only to get let down.  Nope.  We are going to fix that.  And this is where ErikVanD's post pointed me to what we do next.

* It was said to navigate in the BootCamp 5.0.5033 folder to something of the effect of BootCamp/Drivers/Apple and run the MSI file ""BootCamp""  (MSI file will say Windows Installer in its description, and not necessarily MSI for anyone not too savy with Windows) **note - NOT .bootcamp (notice the period in the front) and it should work and install the new Windows 8 support for your MBP...but in my case it didn't, which is why im posting how i fixed this.  Your setup may somehow be different, but mine gave me an error say it ""needs elevated permissions to run, use setup.exe instead.  We tried that remember!  And it gave us the x64 not supported error.  Oh man!  Blabbing aside, this file needs to be ran as an administrator, which yeah your the only user, but Windows is funny like that.  Normally youd just right click, and select run as administrator, but out the box, that option isnt there when you right click, only install, repair, open with etc.  Here's the next trick, you need to add a registry file to enable running as an administrator, dont be afraid, this is an old trick, and really easy.  

* Open notepad in Windows, and create a new doc, call it Add_MSI_run_as_administrator.reg
* Paste this following code into the new doc 


    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  


    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Msi.Package\Shell\runas] ""HasLUAShield""=""""    

    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Msi.Package\shell\runas\Command] @=hex(2):22,00,25,00,53,00,79,00,73,00,74,00,65,00,6d,00,52,00,6f,00,6f,00,74,\    00,25,00,5c,00,53,00,79,00,73,00,74,00,65,00,6d,00,33,00,32,00,5c,00,6d,00,\   73,00,69,00,65,00,78,00,65,00,63,00,2e,00,65,00,78,00,65,00,22,00,20,00,2f,\   00,69,00,20,00,22,00,25,00,31,00,22,00,20,00,25,00,2a,00,00,00 


* Or download the file already made from my company server at http://www.theprojectdev.com/public/pub.html  **i put this there as a courtesy to help others like me, its just a complete reg file, so either create your own through copy and pasting above or download it.  Either way, put it on your desktop.

* Now double click the new registry file, and allow/ok it to do its thing. 
* Once done, you can discard the file from your desktop, or keep, your choice.
* Guess What!?  Now we can do the impossible!  Lets revisit that solution from before by going to the newest BootCamp 5.0.5033, and navigate to BootCamp/drivers/Apple and select that tricky BootCamp MSI file that wouldnt allow us to run, this time RIGHT CLICK it.  Because of our new registry entry we placed, we now have an option to ""Run as Administrator""  Click that option.

* WooHoo!  We have done what coudnt be done, BootCamp will now walk you through the installer, and add all the great support for Windows 8 on your mid 09 Macbook Pro that they for some reason neglected!
* After the update, you will endure yet another restart.  From there, most likely using a wired mouse still, navigate to the system tray icon on the bottom right corner of the screen (little up arrow) and click it.  It will pop up a little menu, showing system processes/stuff running, click the gray squared diamond (this is bootcamp) and it will bring up the newest BootCamp control panel.  From here, you can nav to trackpad/touchpad and set tap to click (finally) and gestures, etc.  This control panel has lots of good stuff to make a MBP user feel comfortable in Windows 8.  There you go!  You did it!

 really, sincerely hope this helps someone, as it really made my day to get this resolved.  I want to add that all On Screen Displays will work (your volume/brightness etc)  they keyboard backlighting, and so much more, it really works great.  I upgraded my hard drive to 1tb, and installed 8gb of PNY RAM from best buy ($40) and it runs Windows 8, AND OSX fantastically.

 

My company http://www.theprojectdev.com designs and develops mobile apps (iOS and Android) and web design and development, so im a heavy user of both OS's, and this setup is just the best thing that has happened to me in a portable sense. Runs so so so fast!  Enjoy everyone!

Fast forward two days &amp; I wake up to an email saying the remote wipe has been started.

I do not mind not being able to use that line out so much, but I do regret not being able to use the internal speakers.

I am convinced audio is switched by software by two observations: 1. When I boot that iMac, it boings through it's internal speakers. 2. When I used to plug headphones in or out, it always took a second before audio was redirected. 

So my question is: How can I convince this software there is nothing connected to the line out, and switch the audio playback back to the internal speakers?

The second is reviewing the list of features that are new and whether they seem like an annoyance or convenience. 

The 'resume' function seems like a nice addition, though not totally necessary. The idea of tying in the app store so closely into the OS and 'launchpad' just doesn't sound appealing to me.

So are there any parts of the upcoming OS that will make you adopt as soon as it comes out? What are the things that make you hesitate?

It used to work great, too, but at some point (in 2011) after having downloaded, installed, and uninstalled a lot of different apps and programs, it (running Snow Leopard) slowed down significantly and became hard to use in most cases. Unless I had freshly restarted (even then, only for an hour or so), things like browsing the web and typing a Word/Pages document would take ages (and sometimes, I'd have repeat freezes/crashes).

When I checked into what it would cost me to back up everything at a store (because my settings and files mattered, and I didn't have an external drive at the time, or cloud storage to really speak of), it was a lot. Hundreds, and several places recommended I get more RAM. The ""most reasonable"" place wanted almost $400, so I went and ordered myself a Windows PC (Samsung), which I'm much more familiar and comfortable with (and am typing this on), for a comparable price ($420, I think).

I was later able to get an external drive and transfer all my files to the Windows computer (though sadly, I'd been in the habit of using Pages for document creation, so they weren't editable), and then I formatted the Macbook. I even paid for and installed Mountain Lion, and it worked great afterwards (a little slow, but I expected that). Once it was fixed-up enough, I decided to install a few necessities on it so that I could use the Macbook as my ""on-the-go"" laptop (it's smaller). Office, iLife, iWork, etc. Worked fine after all that, too.

The more I got to using the Macbook, however - not necessarily installing more, though I did, but making/moving/deleting files - it slowed down again. A lot. It's almost worse, now, than it was before. It's likely partly to do with the (I assume) more system-intensive OS (Mountain Lion), but apart from that and a few essentials I put on it, I really don't, and haven't, done a whole lot with it besides make and move files. The hard drive isn't even half-full. I don't have a ton of services running (Google Drive and DropBox is about it). What's causing this huge slow-down?

1346727214.0,14,self.osx,zbdsp,I think Apple should allow third parties to use Power Nap,krazyfalcon,18,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/zbdsp/i_think_apple_should_allow_third_parties_to_use/,"I wrote an article [here](http://liteforecast.com/2012/9/3/allow-third-parties-to-use-power-nap-apple), but am pasting the entirety of it below. Let me know what you think!

Power Nap for Mac OS X Mountain Lion is a neat feature. When the laptop is in sleep mode, Mountain Lion syncs mail, calendar, contacts, reminders, notes, and documents pushed to iCloud.​ It even updates software downloaded from the Mac App Store and backs up the mac using TIme Machine. But why stop there? With a dedicated API and access to Power Nap, third parties can use this amazing feature to further close the gap between the desktop and the internet.

Take ​Dropbox, for example. I often use it to share pictures with my family. I've set up a folder that I use to upload pictures from my PC (edited and modified using Lightroom and Photoshop) and share with my loved ones. The problem is, if their macs are asleep, they can't receive the photos until they log into the computers and wait for the files to download. I encounter the same problem when i transfer movies from my PC to my Air to watch in another room.

If dropbox could use Power Nap, it can automatically start updating files on my parents' Air so they don't have to wait while dropbox downloads the files. I love dropbox's features mainly because it gives me a file system to work with. I'm not too fond of Apple's Photo Stream because it automatically uploads any picture I take and doesn't give me fine grain control over which computer can view which picture. For me, Photo Stream is just, too simple. Also, I can't just upload my pictures from my DSLR to my's Photo Stream.

The same feature can work with Steam (to sync game files and keep the games up to date), Spotify (to download music I've already favorited so that I can listen to my songs on the go and not have to open my laptop and wait until the songs are downloaded and then leave), and apps like Wunderlist (to keep my checklists up to date), ​and Twitter (to keep twitter in sync). Further, for those who don't use default clients and like third party software like Fantastical, this feature can give the same advantage to these developers.

These are just some ways app developers can take advantage of Power Nap. An always up to date Mac makes for a much better computer experience knowing that you don't have to wait around for your mac to update when it connects to the internet. Some people might say it only takes a couple minutes to update these files, but the same can be said for Mail, Calendar, and Contacts. Also, because their might be multiple changes, it would be faster and more efficient to allow the macs to update while asleep.

Power Nap has untapped potential. By allowing third parties to use Power Nap, I think Apple can convert more developers and users to use macs as their main computers.​",,False,,t5_2qh3j,False,,,True,t3_zbdsp,http://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/zbdsp/i_think_apple_should_allow_third_parties_to_use/,

This seems to be the case for any DVD, though music CDs seem to be playable just fine.  Booting the machine from the disc is equally ineffective.  I've run the AHT and it found no problems.

One nice thing is that now after a reboot, all my windows come up automatically in the same places and sizes as before, from all my apps.

Except Terminal.  I use Terminal a lot, so I always have a lot of open windows.  They do all respawn after a reboot, but 2 columns wider.  So if I had a bunch of 132 column Terminals before, now I have a bunch of 134 column Terminals.  If I don't notice until the next restart, they're 136 columns.

Since I use screen a lot, and reconnect to some of the same screen sessions from work and from home, usually I notice this because I have an attached session in one location and attach to it from another location and find that some columns are hidden and it scrolls sideways when I move the cursor to them.  Then I realize that I must've attached to that screen session from the other Mac whose Terminal windows grew 2 or 4 columns without me noticing.  Having to go through 7 or 8 or 9 windows and resize them one by one is almost as annoying as having to reopen and reposition all those windows myself.

After hours of Googling, fiddling, and otherwise tearing my hair out, I'm hoping someone here might be able to help me with my problem!

I recently updated to Mountain Lion from Lion on my 13"" (Previous Gen) MacBook Air.  I use my machine almost constantly for remote work over SSH and X11.  After updating, I tried this for the first time and my remote machine couldn't find my Mac's display.  I found this odd, so I tried to open xterm on my own mac (locally), and got the following error:

xterm: Xt error: Can't open display: 
xterm: DISPLAY is not set

Now, I was under the impression that I should never set the DISPLAY variable anymore, as X11/XQuartz should do this automatically anytime I try to call an X11 window.  I did some poking around, just in case, to make sure I hadn't accidentally set the DISPLAY variable in any of my profiles or anything, which I hadn't.

I tried downloading and reinstalling: XQuartz AND XCode (for good measure), which have had no effect.  

Since reinstalling XQuartz I **have** been able to open XQuartz, then open an xterm through XQuartz and subsequently open simple X programs like xeyes locally.  However, even through xterm I cannot get my remote machine to forward to my Mac (still can't find a display).

I'm at a complete loss.  I'm nearing the point of doing a system wipe and starting over locally, but I *really* don't want to have to do that.  Any thoughts/ideas would be greatly appreciated!

* use the matrox dual head to split the display port into 2 DVI signals (apparently powerdesk from matrox does a decent job of handling the single virtual display across two monitors)
* use a dual DVI card graphics card on the PC with DVI to HDMI adapters to connect to the monitors

~~switching the dongle~~ (i can use synergy for that) and source input on the monitors is a pain, budget is less than $500 (i already have 1 monitor with DVI and HDMI input).

1. When I drop a file and I have multiple levels expanded, it shows me which folder it will end up in by selecting it. This is fine, but if I move the cursor a couple of pixels, it will deselect the folder and drop it in the folder selected as root. I can see how one would sometimes want this to happen, but in most cases this is really annoying, especially if your windows is small and you can't see if the right folder is selected or not. Am I using Finder the wrong way?

2. This is perhaps more aesthetic thing. Before I drop a folder, Finder will show a blue rectangle around the entire content of the window. This makes sense because I want to know if it understands what window I am trying to drop the file into. But if I scroll while dragging, the rectangle stays where it is instead of always being maximized to the window. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/0gvtqvx.png).

I would like to change the behavior when I click on an app that's not open on the current space. Right now, it goes to whichever space has that app. Instead, I'd like it to favor the current space, including minimized windows.

example: I have two open Chrome windows. One is minimized on space 1, and the second is open on space 2. The currently active space is 1. 

What happens by default: I click the Chrome icon in the dock, and I am switched to space 2 to the open Chrome window there.

What I want to happen: The minimized window on space 1 is restored and made active.
Anyone know how to do this?

How I don't want it to be done: disabling switching spaces to an app to make it active. If I don't have a minimized window on the current space, then I do want it to switch spaces.

**edit**: I tried this, it still doesn't restore the minimize windows. It just makes the app active on the current space. Then when I click Chrome again, it switches spaces. It only seems to restore the window when all the windows are minimized. How frustrating. /edit

coming from a Linux system, it's hard to get used to the application centric approach of OSX, and wish to adapt the OS to my likings, not otherwise.

For example, I have two monitors, each of them having 1 terminal and 1 image viewer and a lot of random other windows. Both monitors have the terminal on the foreground. If I only want to activate the image viewer on the right, I can long click on its dock icon and select the window, or press F3 and search through the windows, but it seems there is not a keyboard-shortcuts-only way to achieve this, or am I wrong (an Alt-tab solution would be awesome!)?

Another related annoyance is that clicking an icon in the dock activates the application, rather than a window. For example, one monitor, with a browser and a ""new email"" window open. I click the browser icon in the dock, do my thing, and want to continue writing my mail, and mindlessly click the Mail icon in the dock, upon which the Mail main window opens, and hides my ""new mail"" window. I'd rather have the latter pop to the foreground than see a window I don't need. Any solution that replaces the dock or something a like?

On my work I've got this macbook pro with OSX 10.6.8. It's got an external screen, an ethernet cable, an external keyboard and a magic mouse connected to it.

When I leave work, I just close the lid, making it go into the suspend state.

However, when it is suspended, it always resumes after a while (seemingly random time). Clearly, I don't like this behaviour, because it should not unhibernate unless I ask it to (and also because I'm usually logged in with Adium, thus switching my status to online.)

I already found a setting that it doesn't hibernate upon opening the lid, but only upon my pressing a key. Obviously, this does not solve the problem. Does anybody else what might cause this behaviour?

Right now I have a bootcamp partition that works great but it is a pain to have to restart everytime I need to use OS X and vice versa.

He also swears he thinks someone is actually able to access his machine (2010 iMac 21.5"").  Of course he has *AOL Mail* (I know, facepalm...) but he also thinks someone is actively hacking directly into his machine.  He told me that at one point he was looking at an email that he thought was faked, and it ""suddenly disappeared.""  (Not sure exactly what that means....)  I think it's more likely his AOL mail got hacked.  Is AOL Mail content in the cloud now?  If so, and someone has compromised it, all of his vital contact info would be available, right?  

This is all made more difficult because he is in the Midwest and I am on the West Coast, so I can't be of much help without being actually able to examine his machine.

He does faithful and regular software updates of his OS X, but other than that there are no AV programs on the machine that I know of.  My first suggestion to him was to get off of AOL mail and move to gmail.  After that, does anyone have any good ideas for a non-tech savvy ""oldster"" that I can suggest to him?

**Edit**:  FWIW, it turns out it was definitely his AOL email that got compromised, so the guy was able to see everything my dad corresponded about. He used that info to try to spoof a request to the investment house for funds.  But his grammar was poor and it was spotted, so they called my dad.  All the funds are safe and AOL swears that they have fixed the problem (I assume by blocking any IP except my Dad's static.)   But I am telling him to get the hell off AOL and move to gmail.  It was weird though, because when the guy caught on that we were on to him he sent my dad an email using Dad's address that was really creepy and vaguely threatening.

It takes forever to load up a directory listing (and when you need to go a few levels deep REALLY is a time eater) that only syncs (as far as i know) when i log in or out (are you kidding me?!).  Second (Ive gotten this to work once or twice) I cant authenticate on the network unless I first login to the machine (after a local profile is created) then connect to the wireless, then i need to logout and back in, to get network share access, there are a few other small things but i cant think of them at the moment.

All in all, they (execs) would like a system with the macs/ipads/iphones rolled out by end of Q1 and I would like to know if there is a better way by utiliziting the xserver we have sitting in the colo which currently is doing NOTHING.

Not having booted Windows in a long time, I've heard rumors that Windows Media Player can manage mp3 files and playlists on bare bones media devices such as a USB thumb drive. This is exactly what I need for my car, except that I don't want to boot Windows just to copy mp3 files to a thumb drive. 

Hence, I am looking for a media player alternative to iTunes that can do the following things, in order of importance:

* drag and drop management of media files/playlists to FAT32 formatted USB devices.
* ID3 tag batch editing abilities that can handle cover art (Ford Sync does not like mp3 files with cover art

So, is this possible with Mail and Exchange (2007) servers?

We recently had the oddest problem occur. We received an image sequence (176 TIFFs) from a Flame suite running on some flavour of Linux (sorry, not sure what). When opening on a Mac Pro running Snow Leopard we discovered that every 28th file in the sequence had a malformed name. 

So rather than

&gt;MY\_JOB\_FILE\_NAME\_shot01\_test\_028.tif 

it gave a short file name equivalent: 

&gt;MYF42C~3.TIF.

The format was the first two letters of the file name, followed by a 4 character hex string, tilde and a number or letter. When looking at the drive with an iMac running Leopard or a desktop running XP all file names seem fine. I've only just been brought in on this problem, so I'll update this as I discover more. It's not a massive problem, as we can just work around it. But, it's annoying and more importantly mind-blowingly confusing. 

Does anyone know why 28 might be a significant number? Why a file might lose its LFN? Why Snow Leopard wouldn't read it properly when Leopard or XP would?

My suspicion at the moment is that the Linux box has done something non-standard with the files and Snow Leopard is being much more strict with the standards than previous versions or XP.

I'm running a MacBook Pro (&lt;1 year old)

Processor: 2.8GHz Intel Core 2 Duo

RAM: 4GB 1067 MHz DDR3

It's connected to the power supply, and it's set to High Performance (meaning the dedicated graphics card should be in use)

Every time I try to play a game, my Mac completely freezes. I'm currently trying to play the Sims 3; hardly graphic-intensive. As soon as I click the Play button, the screen goes black and the disc drive starts to whirr (sometimes vibrating the computer violently). Then the animated EA logo swirls onto the screen, and the load music starts up. Before the EA logo can fully animate, my computer dies. The screen instantaneously goes black, and the background music keeps playing in a skipping fashion, like a broken record: click-click-click-click.

Force Quit does nothing. None of the hardware buttons, e.g. volume/brightness controls, do anything. I have to hold down the power button to restart.

It probably isn't overheating, since I've tried with my fans on full blast (smcFanControl) and I'm currently using a laptop cooling pad.

I used to be able to play the Sims for a few hours before it would crash: it has gotten much worse. I downloaded the WoW demo and got a bit farther: I could create a character, but within 5 seconds of playing this same problem would happen.

I know Macs aren't particularly good at playing games, but this seems a bit ridiculous. Can anyone help? I have the full error report saved, if that would be useful.

**TL;DR: While loading a game, my MacBook Pro full-crashes, becoming totally unresponsive, before the EA logo can even animate.**

I don't use it very often, so I hadn't check to see if it was Snow Leopard compatible, and this was the first time I'd launched it since upgrading. It appeared in the dock, then went away. No big deal, I downloaded the newest version, and launched it. Then I noticed something. Some thing all around the UI are white. As in, things which shouldn't be white. Anything in list view (iTunes, Finder, anything) has a solid white background, instead of stripes. However, when a window is over it, the drop shadow has stripes. I'm wondering if this has something to do with java, as some elements of websites have changed to white as well, such as the ""my reddits"" bar (at least under Safari). Also, iCal MAY be highlighting the current date, but it's white, so I can't tell.

Any help would be appreciated. I mentioned java as a possible problem because I believe CyberDuck was having issues with it in snow leopard, and it seems that might be why this problem is affecting websites as well, when opened in Safari.

**TL;DR:** Cyberduck broke some aspect of the OS X gui system wide. Things are white which should not be white.

I've read that you can use diskwarrior from an external hard drive, but that you have to actually install the system on the hard drive.

Every now and then, the computer would start to lag so I would open up the Activity Monitor and I could see that RAM was being pulled from the inactive section to give whatever app that needed it some memory. I'm not a fan of the sudden lagging of my entire system and was wondering if it's possible to somehow have more of that 'Inactive' RAM set as 'Free'.

Longtime lurker, first post - never had an issue I couldn't fix by just reading up on it before...

So my volume keys (F10/F11) stop working after I unplug my headphones. I've seen similar issues addressed in forums, but not like this, and none of the suggested remedies seem to help.

On startup, the volume keys work. When I plug in headphones, they continue to work. When I unplug the headphones, they continue displaying the volume icon onscreen, and the volume indicator dots/slider still moves, with no effect on the actual volume. When I plug the headphones back in, same thing: onscreen indicator - no actual change.

•Updating software
•Permissions repair
•Chucking system audio Plist (com.apple.audio.AggregateDevices)
•Resetting PRAM and NVRAM
•Resetting the SMC

- Bluetooth on mac is set to on / discoverable. I've tried every configuration of plugging / unplugging / pushing the PS button (it flashes slowly when charging, quickly when in 'pairing mode') but my mac will not recognize it.

- bought these 2 controllers. they are brand new. I do not own a PS3 to pair with that way. Their model numbers are CECHZC2U. I saw somewhere that when sony did a firmware update that these controllers were sometimes affected but I don't actually have a PS3 so I'd imagine the drivers are still workable in SL?

I've been futzing with this for about 2 hours and it's driving me crazy. Every video I see is ""plug in the controller to your USB on computer. Unplug. Push PS button. Voila! Paired"". Except... no. There is zero pairing happening. I've successfully paired my iPhone with my laptop and the laptop and mac mini try to pair with each other when bluetooth is on, so their bluetooth's are working.

I've tried this on both my Mac Mini and MBP running Snow Leopard. I've tried with both controllers. I've tried installing the USB drivers (old) found on http://tattiebogle.net.

Is this a version of the controller that simply won't work?

Any ideas?,sinembarg0,3,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/i417v/computer_crashing_and_behaving_erratically_any/,"I've got an 11.6"" MacBook Air with 64GB SSD and 4GB ram. I'm experience some really odd behavior and have no idea what's causing it, so I figured I'd ask here and see if anyone might know.

I pretty much have 4 problems. The first is running out of ram. With no apps running at all, about 1GB of ram is used. Usually I have less than 200MB free ram. (this problem is probably chrome + flash. I have too many tabs open in chrome). I'm probably gonna have to go back to firefox to fix this one.

The second problem is running out of disk space. It seems something is leaking memory to disk, because I frequently get warning about having no space left (finder says Zero KB available). I kill every app and menu bar item, and it sometimes goes up a bit, but I don't get it all back until I restart. Yesterday I went from Zero KB avail with everything open to just over 5GB free after rebooting.

The third problem I think is caused by the first two. Every so often, the whole computer just crashes. It goes to a blue screen (not a BSOD or a kernel panic), then behaves as if I just logged in. All my apps instantly close. I think the computer is running out of usable storage for anything, and just fails miserably at coping with this. Sometimes it pops up a window saying I must kill open apps to free up memory, but not all the time. Sometimes this window pauses a process, and there's no way I can figure out how to unpause it (tried clicking resume, tried freeze frame and tried the command line, but can't remember what command). All of this is a bit annoying, and I plan to reformat and reinstall when Lion comes out.

TThe last problem though, is by far the most annoying. It just started happening, and I have no idea what's causing it. Randomly, my keyboard just stops working. I can still option click finder to relaunch it, and if I open the keyboard viewer and press keys, it shows them as being pressed. However, if I go to finder, or chrome, or any place I can enter text, nothing shows up at all. Keyboard shortcuts don't work either. Nothing shows up if I manually click on keys in the keyboard viewer as well. The only way to fix this is to either reboot, or put the computer to sleep and wake it up (which can be difficult to do in certain circumstances. I use insomniaX to keep the computer awake when I shut the lid, so if that's enabled, there is no way to put the computer to sleep. When the whole OS crashes [3rd problem], InsomniaX fails to put its menu bar icon back in the menu bar. The only way to get it back is to use the keyboard shortcut I have set to enable / disable insomniax. This is impossible when keyboard shortcuts don't work. I tried killing and relaunching, but the menu bar icon still doesn't come back. There is a separate kext that prevents sleep, so even with the app killed, the computer can't go to sleep.)

I'm running a 27"" iMac with Snow Leopard.  Everything worked find until about a month ago when suddenly Air Video (a video serving app for the iPad) would no longer play movies.  

Investigating the problem, I discovered that the Airvideo app on my iPad now sees the paths differently than before.  Instead of Volumes&gt;DroboShare&gt;PartitionName it now sees Volumes&gt;0dc084621174&gt;LUN0&gt;PartitionName.  

I thought the comp just glitched when it mounted the server so I threw them away.  About 30 seconds later, they pop back up on their own (2 Partitions).  Previously, if I manually dismounted them, they would stay that way unless I connected using ""Connect to Server..."" in the Finder.  I now believe whatever is causing the auto-remount may be the root of my problem, but I have no idea how to troubleshoot this.

Does anyone know how I can track this behavior down and kill it?

I like the fact that I can send a message to someone's iPhone if they use iMessage. That is great. What is not cool is that if I send someone a message through Messages in my desktop, and then text the  same person, it will show up as two separate entires on their phone. As if from two different people. Then when they text me back, depending on which entry they choose, it gets sent to my phone or to Messages. 

How I think it should work:

When I send a message using Messages to someone, it should appear just like it came from my phone as a text. 

I would love the feature where if someone texts me, it would appear on both my phone and on Messages. If I alt-tab to messages, it registers that I read it and it makes it disappear from my phone. If I unlock my phone and open the text app and read it, then it will disappear from Messages. That way, it hits all my devices, and depending on which one i read it on, it will remove it from the others so that I don't have to read it again.

I upgraded recently from Snow Leopard. I upgraded because of the hype, the iCloud support - basically all the listed improvements. I feel most of them. To say, I really like Mountain Lion, except for one thing - EXPOSE.

I really dislike Mission Control. For one, the combination of ""Expose"" and ""Spaces"" killed one of OS X' shining features, that is, Expose and Spaces. Second - Expose is dead. Long live Expose. The ""Expose"" in Mission Control is not the Expose that Steve Jobs WOW'ed everyone in in his reveal of it in his famous keynote of OS X Panther. He described Expose as the ""beautiful function that shows all your windows no matter how many you have so you don't have to fumble or wonder which app has which window open."" Mountain Lion took a knife and plunged it into Expose, the feature that made me fall in love with OS X.. It's really difficult to use OS X right now, when I cannot see which windows I have open, because the dock tells me I have it open, but nothing I do shows me said windows, unless I manually search for it. Why? Why does it have to be like this?

Don't get me wrong.. I really like Mountain Lion so far, but this erroneous and half-baked feature completely destroys the foundation of what turned a lot of people from Windows to OS X (for me, Windows and OS X coexist together). I don't know where I can find the solution. I use XCode, and at the same time, I have tutorial videos, I have many Photoshop images open, I have web pages (though they are tabbed), and I have chat clients. Everyone's expectation of Mission Control is to show ALL OPEN WINDOWS despite their minimized status. It does not do this. 

I apologize I ranted a bit to describe my point. So what can an individual actually do to have real Expose back?",,False,,t5_2qh3j,False,,,True,t3_11it7f,http://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/11it7f/the_woes_of_mission_control_rant/,

All is working great, I simply want to install Windows 2008 Server on this machine instead.  

Is this even possible?  No matter what I try, I simply cannot get the installer to work at all.  These are the methods I've tried:

- Write the ISO to USB.  No matter how I try to boot (hold ALT key, C, D, etc), the USB device will not be recognized.

- Write the ISO to DVD.  Same situation as the USB drive: no option to boot from that device at all.

The same USB and DVD media will work fine on my ThinkPad older than the Mac Mini, the Mini simply doesn't take it.  I've even tried using an external DVD drive for this and nothing works.  I know the DVD and USB drives work fine (even booted Leopard DVD client from external USB DVD drive), so there has to be some reason why I can't boot.

Other people have Windows 2008 server working on the Mini without Bootcamp, but I'm thinking my model is too old?  Is there anything I can do to get this working?

I don't speak a lot of Mac, but I totally understand the concepts behind virtualization, P2V, V2V etc and versus dual-booting.  I've attempted to P2V my existing Win7 64bit Enterprise edition within Fusion, but it fails with an error code that can mean many things. Tried looking in support databases for help and calling a buddy that P2Vs for a living, but none of the suggested plans of action worked for me.  So I'm cutting my losses and it's time for plan B, meaning not using the VMWare product on my Mac.

As I understand it, I can virtualize a bootcamp partition with Parallels.  This gives me the best of both worlds, as I can work with the same data set within a Win7 only world or via Parallels and virtualization.  The thing is that I don't understand how to get my existing PC P2V'd to allow for this functionality.  None of the installation notes reference this sort of config, as they all talk about installing Win7 from scratch first.  Yet, I've seen reference to migrating an existing Win7 platform into Parallels.

So my question is: how do I P2V my existing Win7 world into Parallels in such a way that I can still work with it via Bootcamp and use the same data set no matter if I'm running via dual-boot or within a VM?

I have always wanted a Mac and had even installed software to make my PC look like OS X (FlyAKite OSX, Yahoo! Widgets, RKLauncher, etc). We've always had PCs in my family, and all still do; I'm the only one with a Mac. I like the way the computer looks but Mountain Lion is simply the worst operating system I have ever used, if it can even be called an operating system, because it doesn't operate at all.

About a month after I got my Mac, the hard drive crashed. Luckily, the Apple Store guys were able to recover my data and copy it over to a new Mac they gave me through a retail swap. A month later, the brand new mac had another hard drive crash, which they replaced (all for free), however with no compensation (I was hoping for a free iPod Touch, but wasn't expecting one). So far, I haven't had any mechanical problems (knock on wood), although my second Mac's hard drive seems to be slightly louder. 

I installed Windows last year so I could play some of the games I like and run some PC software natively, and then upgraded to Windows 8 when it was still $40, whose partition I gave 100 GB. 

The following is a list of what bothers me:

* Waking up from sleep takes 2 minutes from the time I open my lid to the time I can finish logging in
* Falling asleep takes just as long (Windows does it instantly)
* Logging in from a shut-down or restart takes at least 5 minutes until I can open a program
* Memory usage is incredibly inefficient. I can have one window of any browser with five tabs, and it's already using at least 500 MB of RAM; another open window with five tabs as well makes it slow down to a crawl. Keep in mind that those are the only two programs open besides Activity Monitor. 
* ""Inactive RAM"" is a complete mystery and why it doesn't get cleaned even if I use the *sudo purge* command.
* Windows 8 lets me run ten tabs each in three windows with multiple instances of OpenOffice and five Metro apps with no hiccup
* The computer wakes up from sleep when I unplug it from power, USB, or external display only in Mountain Lion.

These are just some of the annoyances, but most of them. Thinking back to when I got my Mac, I would have been much better off buying a ThinkPad for the same price and same configuration. Mountain Lion and Windows 8 are like night and day, respectively, one harking back to the days of Windows ME and the other working like a computer should.
