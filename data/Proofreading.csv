* Give enough time for people to proofread your work. I'd say at least a week before a paper is due, but I'm open to suggestions.
* If you're not sure of something, read it aloud to see if it makes sense before submitting. This will help more than you think.
* Proofread it yourself before submitting it here! I know that a second or third set of eyes picks up things you missed, but it's irritating to read over someone's work if they have obvious errors they themselves could have caught.
* When you submit your work, indicate what academic style under which you want us to review your work: MLA, APA, Blue Book, etc. (thanks to sheerheartattack!)
* If you wish to retain your anonymity, it may be wise to redact your name, institution, professor, etc. (thanks to sheerheartattack [again]!)
* If correcting a Word document, use the *Track Changes* button so it will be obvious what you fixed. (thanks to dangerous_eric!)

**Ways to submit what you need read:**

* Post the content of what you need proofed in a self post. Obviously, this will only work for short works (a few paragraphs or so).
* Use **Google Docs** and either link directly to that or link to it in a self post.
* Use an uploading service like megaupload or rapidshare to upload your document and post the link in a self post.
* Post that you'd like help with your email address (or instructions to PM you to get an email address). Then you can just finish things up over email.

* Assignment guidelines could be very helpful. Let us know what kind of paper it is. Is it for a medical journal, a college class, a fun story you're writing? Each of those types of papers has different rules to follow and need to be edited differently.
* Spam filter! I do my best to check it at least once a day, and I'm sure masqueradestar does the same, but we're not here all the time. Check the r/proofreading page to see if your link posted. If not, message the mods! We're happy to help.

  I love you.  
  Your feet are big bowls of perfect porridge to the Goldilocks that is my Chinese sex drive, your farts are sweet puffs of opium, seducing my ship of silver (that is my schlong) into surrendering, as any sinohistorian would see it.   
  My my, in the months since I’ve met you my mind can’t mend itself to think of any other mademoiselles. If you were kept captive by the KKK, I can’t count the Klansmen I’d kill to save you. If you were a pet, you would be my princess Persian cat and I’d be your proud parent. I’d pamper you with Poulot, and any other pricy petite portioned pet foods.   
  I want to explore the extremes of exotic sex, to exploit your natural resources. I want to bulldozer your forestry, mine your precious ore, harvest your honey, hunt for your horns, and hang your human hide to dry in the Honduran sun.  
  I would run through a mile of mouse traps to smell your toilet paper. I will spend my life as a scholar in a library seeking lore so I lead to something long sought after: the Holy Grail. I will then place it beneath you, for you deserve to piss into nothing else.   
  You are so right and honourable my esteemed lady, most graceful and excellent. You merit a garter of my thistle, my dame. Oh be eternal, the hours I could spend honouring your odor, my obsession!  If the aristocracy were still alive you needn’t ask for a single thing my archduchess, for an assortment of all things amazing would be at your ankles: aphrodisiacs, aioli, Asian animals, absolutely anything that you ask to acquire.  Your bathwater has the nutrients to sustain a battered Burundi village for two weeks. When you slip into a state of sleep, I’m surprised no stoners sneak up and sex you.    
  My queen, if you quaintly became a man I’d quickly quit women and turn queer for you, for I can’t quantify the scope of my quest to conquer you. You are the quesadilla to my inner starving Ecuadorean, the Quran to my quintessential Muslim self.   
  And if you pooped, fine flowers would flourish from the fertilized feces that fall from your funhole. But graceful girls like you don't glut themselves with the gentlemanly grosses of gastronomy.  Only you can make a burp sound like a seductive serenade and croak out lieders of love. 
   I leave you my loony love letter. You don’t need to go to Yale with their snobbish yuppies riding on obnoxious yachts; you have us youngsters always here to support you. If the world's men and women were you, communism would work.  
  
Jacking off to the thought of you doing some jumping jacks,  
Jason

here is my letter:
To whom it may concern,
or,
Dear fellow book lovers,

Seeing your ad on Craigslist today was serendipitous. Earlier this afternoon, I was thinking about the directions my life could take from where I am now. The three options I came up with for my future are: being a high school literature teacher, working in a bookstore, or running an organic bed and breakfast.

I have been working in a small, locally-owned cafe for over two and a half years. Over the course of my tenure there, I have learned many invaluable skills applicable to working in, and potentially owning, a small business of my own.  I have an excellent rapport with all of our customers.  About 80% of our daily clientele are regulars who come in 3 - 5 times a week. I know them all by name, and they know mine.  I am experienced in settling a till at the end of the day. I have been responsible for hiring and training new employees. I take care of inventory and ordering, and have taken on and mastered any challenge put before me. I have become accustomed to a busy and demanding work atmosphere where I am constantly on the move, multitasking, and finding creative ways to solve problems. The owner leaves town on a regular basis, leaving me in charge of the business in her absence. The duties required of me are opening the cafe, coming up with and preparing a variety of daily specials, managing the other employee or employees on duty, maintaining a clean and welcoming atmosphere, closing down and a variety of cleaning tasks.

The skills I have learned at the cafe are ones that are important to any job. This combined with my great love of books would make me a unique candidate for this job. My mother was a literature teacher during my childhood, and I was lucky enough to inherit an intense passion for reading from her.  Reading has been a part of my everyday life for as long as I can remember.  Reading and perusing books is how I spend the vast majority of my free time.  My most recent literary conquest was Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, and I must say I am rather proud of the accomplishment.  

If I were able to choose my top ten favorite books, they would be (in no particular order): Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts, the His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman, Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami, The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer, Time Enough For Love by Robert A. Heinlein, Infinite Jest by DFW, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay by Michael Chabon, Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand and The Giver by Lois Lowry. Oh, and Life of Pi by Yann Martel! Clearly, it is hard for me to narrow the list down to ten.

Working in a book store would be like a dream for me.  To be surrounded by books, and the people who love them, would be an intensely satisfying and fulfilling career for me. I am fully invested in Eugene, and don't have any problem making a full-time, long term commitment. 

I hope to have the opportunity to speak with you soon about your store and what I could contribute.

I am interested in applying for the scientific research summer internship position that was listed through the University of ___ Career Services Office. I am sending my resume, so you can determine whether I qualify for the Internship with the Urban Wildlife Institute.


I have had a great deal of laboratory experience in chemistry, biology, physics, soils, and ecology. My laboratory experience pertains to both field techniques as well as indoor lab skills. I possess excellent troubleshooting skills which can assist with trapping, using remote-triggered cameras, radio equipment, and almost all essential computer skills needed for the position. In addition to assisting with the wildlife research, I can easily work well with other in a group project, as well as working individually on a project, where I have done so in the many Environmental courses I have taken. As a Natural Resources and Environmental Science major I believe I am qualified by my knowledge of Ecology, the Illinois fauna, and my commitment to wildlife conservation. Also, as an active member of the Illini foresters and Red Bison two environmental clubs at the University of Illinois, where I participate in wildlife management, and the conservation of fields in the Champaign area, there we steward areas with some lopping and pruning. 


I believe that I would an asset to your program. This internship would provide me with the ideal opportunity to assist at your organization and to expand my research skills. I am willing to whatever institute related activities as necessary, as well as work outside and early morning hours. If so, I hope to schedule an interview at a mutually convenient time.

Thank you in advance!

**First Draft**

Experiences are what make us who we are. The experiences we have teach us our values and customs. I believe that the experiences I had have prepared me for the affairs that will come my way. One program I would like to be a part of is University of North Florida’s Honors Program. I believe that I will benefit from the program through the exclusive classes available to Honors Students and the duties that will be presented to me. I believe that I will make a quality addition to UNF’s Honors Program for the following reasons. 

One of the most fulfilling experiences I’ve had so far was when I volunteered as Technical Director for my high school’s drama program. The Technical Director has duties such as keeping schedules, managing people, and fulfilling the director and producer’s visions for the production. As Technical Director, I oversaw everything during production that was behind the scenes. I motivated and assigned people to projects. Being able to manage these people effectively to fit our tight schedule took leadership. I also gained practice in teamwork by helping crews accomplish tasks such as building a platform, painting a set piece, or ironing costumes. 

As Technical Director, a lot of issues fell on my shoulders. I needed to be quick on my feet and have a sharp mind to fix problems. These instances where I managed crises tested my critical thinking and problem solving skills. Once during production, we had used the last of our budget for building the set, but we needed at least $150 worth of lumber. I found a local lumber dealer and made an arrangement that he would trade us some lumber for ad space in our play’s program. There was also an issue where our costume mistress was threatening to quit the production and take all of the male costumes she made home with her. I presented at the parent booster meeting our need for donations, and even though our costume mistress didn’t leave, we received enough donations to add another costume change between scenes. 

A successful person starts any job, assignment, project, or resolution with determination, devotion, and a sense of enthusiasm. This can be reflected in my academic experiences at UNF. After I toured the campus with my father in August of 2010, I heard that there was a deadline about 2 weeks later to have my application reviewed and find out if I was accepted the following October. I gathered what I needed and ordered my transcripts by the application deadline. On October 2nd, I received my admission decision, I had been invited to start the upcoming summer, but if I brought my overall high school GPA up, I could change my start date to the fall instead. I finished my first semester of my Senior Year with six As and one B. This improvement allowed me to change my start date to the fall, and I continued to do extremely well in my classes during my second semester also. 
This determination still hasn’t faltered now that I am actually taking college level classes. I completed my first semester with a 3.7 GPA. My enthusiasm hasn’t faded either. It’s the beginning of my second semester and I walk into every class eager to learn what my professor has to offer next. I look forward to the classes that I will take next fall, and the spring after that. Thanks to this zeal, I am able to complete homework easily for near perfect grades.  

I recently declared my major in Health Administration. Before declaring, I thought I wanted a degree in business, but I knew that I wanted to work in healthcare, but didn’t know how to without taking up nursing. My mother was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer September 2009. I wouldn’t be able to count the number of times I witnessed her experiences with the health care system. I realized that there was someone behind the hospital and insurance companies that helped my mom gain her health back, and I decided that that’s the job I want. My dream job would to become a Hospital Administrator. I want to be able to manage doctors and procedures most effectively to provide a comfortable experience for patients on their road to recovery. To reach my goals, I look forward to completing internships that will let me apply skills to a job I want to make a career. I also have applied to live in the Brooks College of Health Living Learning Community for next school year. Through the living learning community, I hope to meet professionals in my field who will give me insight and advice for my advancement. I will also be in pursuit of a Leadership Certificate from the Institute of Values from UNF. I have not taken Introduction to Leadership yet, but plan to this coming fall to begin my documentation of all my leadership experiences.  

University of North Florida’s Honors Program will help me polish and develop the skills I have and I expect to learn additional talents also. I am an earnest applicant who wants to grow and develop within my university. The experiences and goals I’ve written about show why I would make a good asset to the program. Lydia Maria Child, a woman’s rights activist of the 1800’s, once said, “Belief in oneself is one of the most important bricks in building any successful venture.” I believe in myself, and I know that I will prosper at University of North Florida, and will prosper in University of North Florida’s Honors Program.

My English score was 91 which the admin lady told me was 0.5 points off from placing into English 1A (the English class you need for your degree) She said I could petition the score and see if I get into the higher English class, I did and was approved for 2009 English 1A but was unable to take it due to life getting in the way. Anyway! I guess you have to re-petition every year which I did not know about until the day before class registration ended, so I wrote something out really fast and subsequently was denied from the English class. I tried talking to the Dean of Admin at the time but he did not show up to our appointment and did not return my calls. So here I am a third time, hopefully I'll get it this time so I wont ever have to deal with it ever again. Just let me know if this sounds ok, or if anything needs to be fixed. Thanks! 


Dear Dean of Admissions,

I would like to challenge my test score, which places me into a lower English class. I believe that I not only have the skills for English 1A but that I would also have no problem getting a successful grade in the class as well. I have petitioned this twice before, once in 08 in which I was approved. Then also one more time in 2010, that time being I was denied. I feel I was denied from this class in 2010 because of the hastily written letter I wrote you. I can assure you that that letter did not properly reflect my writing, spelling or grammar* abilities. I was quickly trying to fill out the form so I would not miss out on this class. If you look at my high school transcript you will see that I got “A's” every year in English, and that my college assignment test score was not a low one either; I was only 0.5 points off, or so I was told. I hope you will reconsider and let me enter English 1A so I can continue on with my goals of getting my associates degree, here at [Blah blah College]. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

ShinyFirefly

My high school years have been an adventure filled with lots of ups and downs. The difference between the start of my freshman year and now is simply astounding. It is crazy to think how many changes I have gone through in such a short time, not everyone has a huge amount of changes in high school but  guess I am just one of those people who  had some huge life changing decisions decided in high school. High school has probably been the most influential thing to ever happen to me and I am glad that it all happened at Kentwood. The start of freshman year was scary for me as I'm sure it's scary for most people, I remember thinking that I better like this school because I'm going to be spending the next 4 years here. This new year gave me a fresh new start not many people remember you from middle school once high school starts so this was my time to make a change. Looking back I hate myself because of what I did for my freshman year, I had terrible hygiene in school that year I hardly ever showered or changed my clothes and I wore my glasses to make it even worse. It was not a good start to my freshman year in hindsight. I decided I wanted to a good GPA and to take a difficult course load so I took my core classes as honors, which was just about all you could do as a freshman. I was a very serious kid in my freshman year and I'm sure I was not that much fun back then. I decided against taking my two required language classes this year and I really regret doing that. I also had a look into my future with electronics because in that class there were computers with games on them and instead of working I just spent my time playing games and I came the closest I have ever come to failing a class in my school career. I also had my favorite teacher ever freshman year, Mr. Allegado was my ninth grade science teacher and that was by far my favorite class to take.  Mr. Allegado made the class fun and I had a lot of fun learning science from him. Freshman year was fun but it was only the first step in my high school journey.
	Moving on to sophomore year, this is when I started getting more used to high school but I was still an underclassmen so was still very new. The first decision I made was I was going to be cleaner and better kept, I got all the amenities required for that, I even got new contacts and ditched the glasses I was much more confident this year. I started my 2 years of French this year and it was absolutely terrible, I have a very bad memory and the language was very hard to learn, as of writing this right now I still can't speak any full sentences but I passed so that is all that matters. I started out the year with a good science teacher he was also my advisory teacher, then something happened with the teachers and he had to go teach at a different school which left me without a science teacher or advisor. My new advisory teacher was awful I don't remember his name but he was unnecessarily rude and told a lot of stories and got mad if you talked during them, luckily I only had him for this year. My new science teacher was a freshman teacher that they just boosted up she had never taught the subject of biology and if you don't know what you are teaching you are not going to be able to teach it. I took Web design as one of my electives, it was my first computer elective and I thought I might want to go into it when I got older, you always hear in movies and on TV about ""writing code' that sounded interesting and I wanted to try it, little did I know it was just a bunch of memorizing symbols and typing, I have a terrible memory so I was very bad at that just like I was bad at French. This was the only two semesters I did not take a gym class and I discovered gym is by far my favorite class; I really missed it during this time. All my life I have excelled without trying at math, my brain just got it, but once again my bad memory caught up to me in high school and the math here wasn't just arithmetic it was memorize this equation and use it then memorize this equation and combine it with that, everything I am terrible at, this was the first year I ever struggled with math and it was eye opening.  It was at the end of this year that something changed and it created the basis for which the next two years would be founded on, in the end nothing really matters.
	I started junior year and was already tired of school a week in, which told me I needed to start having fun or I wouldn't be able to show up every day. So have fun is what I did I got senioritis junior year and it never left me, in my mind nothing mattered. In my math class something new happened, there was no grades for classwork whatsoever so all I had to do good on was the tests, there was also a minimum of fifty percent I could get on the tests, so even if I bombed a few I would still pass, I sat at the back of the classroom for the entire year and stared at my phone my teacher knew but he had been teaching for long enough that he just didn't care. I did the same in Physics class but not quite as extreme, I did have to do some classwork and I paid attention some but it was pretty crazy how much time I spent staring straight down in those two classes combined. Physics was probably the hardest class I have taken but I'm good at science so it was alright I really regret not taking chemistry though, because was a junior in a sea of seniors. It was the complete opposite of my French class that I was struggling to get through, because I was a junior in a sea of sophomore. I made a lot of bad decisions in school but my worst that I regret the most is how I set up my classes. For my social studies class I had probably the worst teacher I have ever had, this was his last year of teaching and he just didn't care anymore, he was fine I liked him but his assignments were the same all year, hand out a bunch of papers and tell us to do questions out of the textbook then do vocabulary. The most lazy and unnecessary things, that could only be described as busy work, is what we worked on. French was still terrible but I had a lot of fun in there too I couldn't speak French so it was very hard to pass that class but I did it. This was the year I was supposed to the junior project, which I didn't because I am super lazy, I regret not doing it now but I can't say I would do it any differently if I went back to change it. English was also pretty fun, I had a choice to take 3 different English classes and I of course took the easiest one so I was able to pass that class without trying very hard, which was very nice. Last but not least I took gym again and it was by far my favorite part of the day.
	If I thought I was lazy junior year I went to a whole new level senior year. I had no more math or science classes so I didn't really have any homework heavy classes which I am very thankful for because I definitely wouldn't have ever done it. I had to take al of my art credits this year because I hadn't taken them in any of my other years, in my opinion one of the dumbest things about school is the required credits, you're telling me that I have to take a drawing class sometime in my year? Senior year has been very fun so far, I learned from my previous years to not take difficult electives so I had a lot of easy ones. I took gym which is still my favorite class by far and I really do regret not taking it during my sophomore year. I took two art classes ceramics is one which I enjoy because it is not very hard, but I am terrible at art so I also do not do very good in it. I took printmaking which is probably my least favorite class I have ever taken, the teacher was very rude to all the students and it was just so repetitive and boring. For my last elective I took business which has been very fun thus far, I am very good at presentations and that is what they are most of the time. For my Current world issues class I went from a terrible teacher that was bored out of his mind to the opposite of the spectrum, Mr. Veliz who is basically the complete opposite of that he always talked about how he didn't want to be one of those teachers that just made handouts which is basically what my social studies teacher had been doing all year, the class was difficult but it was a refreshing change from the boredom of last year. After I took my one semester of current world issues I had an extra slot for a class so I took astro/geo which is taught by my favorite teacher Mr. Allegado. It has been very fun so far just like I remembered it from freshman year. I took the SATs and did beastly on them luckily because I would have been in serious trouble if I didn't because my class load wasn't exactly that difficult and my GPA was nothing to be proud of. I then got accepted to Washington State University so in the end everything worked out in the end. Now hopefully I can just graduate on time and have some smooth sailing. 
	In conclusion I have changed so much from freshman year it is pretty insane to think we were the same person. I made a life decision half way between my high school years and I am very happy with it. I decided that life to me at least is all about happiness, I wasn't happy and now I am that should be the most important thing to me. Am I happy right now and I can proudly say that I am.

With the fall of Roman Empire, political unity of the Greco-roman civilization disappeared. Numerous historians of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages have questioned how long and to what capacity the Greco-Roman culture sustained itself after the arrival of the ""barbarian"" people in the Mediterranean region. It can be noted that while much has been written about the extent to which the Greco-Roman culture has continued in the European part of the former Empire, its existence in the Islamic part has been neglected. This article attempts to explain the continuity of the Greco-Roman civilization in the Islamic world in a more systematic and accurate way. It will assert that the Greco-Roman culture continued in the Islamic parts of the Mediterranean even after the Arab conquests of the seventh century. Until the mid-eighth century, during the reign of the first Islamic dynasty Umayyad (661-750), an Islamic state, in legal, administrative, social, economic, and philosophical terms, was a follower of the late antique Greco-Roman state, therefore Byzantium. The article explained and demonstrated the claim that only the arrival of new Abbasid dynasty to power, when the caliphate ""abandoned"" the Mediterranean, and directed toward the East, respectively Persia, in fact, was the beginning of classical Islamic civilization, and the disappearance of the Greco-Roman civilization, that will still remain permanent inspiration to many Islamic thinkers.

Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is set in the 1890s during Europe's colonization of Africa. Conrad contrasts characters, settings and ideologies to illuminate and reinforce the central concerns, motifs and social criticisms in Heart of Darkness. The Central Station Manager embodies the majority of the Europeans in Africa who are under the belief that they are emissaries of progress but are unknowingly corrupt from their lives in civilization. Marlow and the Manager are intensely set on reaching Kurtz at the Inner Station for their own reasons; Marlow's desire comes from wanting to meet a man who is able to challenge limits, but the Manager only wants to triumph over Kurtz and keep his position in the Company safe. The Congo affects the Central Station Manager and Charles Marlow in opposing fashions; the Station Manager experiences no transformation and Marlow is profoundly influenced by his time in the jungle. 
	
Marlow takes time from being a sailor to become the captain of a steamboat in the Congo and search for new mysteries in the world. He anticipates adventure and further enlightenment, but not the darkness that encompasses his thoughts and his surroundings. Marlow is affected differently by the Congo than everyone else he comes across because of both his worldly experience and his time spent on the sea. Marlow believes a bond is created between men when an environment that is mysterious makes them work together to survive, but the Congo seems to tell man that he is inferior and it appears as if it is a mad scramble for ivory where every man thinks only of himself.  While in Africa Marlow comes to the realization that he under the spell of the philosophy of romanticism, and therefore different from the other Europeans working for the Company who are influenced by the scientific philosophy  Both philosophies deny the existence of real mystery, and put man in touch with ideas which are simpler than the truth.  Civilization and science created limits and ideas of what was true in an attempt to allow control in the world, however when the Europeans are placed into an anti environment none of them seem to see the consequences of their actions.  Science defined things as if their embodiment in time didn't exist, however in the Congo light and dark are in flux and have different meanings depending on their context. These ideas the Europeans misconcieve as truths cause the supposed missionaries of light to inflict irreversible damage to Africa due to the ignorance and hollowness that comes with the 'enlightened' world. Marlow says they were ""killing out of ignorance,(were)greedy without voracity, (and) cruel without courage""(21).The Company saw themselves as enlightened people simply because they came from a 'later' time. Science and romanticism conditioned men to see things without the existence of time. The Congo is a place where neither science nor romanticism live. It is impossible to hold on to romanticism because it is such a sensual and dark place,and the reason that Marlow begins to see his conditioning. Marlow considers himself a man who has an understanding of the world,  he has travelled to the ""Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas—a regular dose of the East—(for) six years or so"" (7), yet after experiencing a ""stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention""(41), Marlow had to change his idea of what a country was.  Marlow is aware of the amazing reality of concealed life in the Congo, yet still is bewildered by the power and darkness of the jungle. Marlow says at the central station, the ""moon spreading over everything a thin layer of silver…upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall of a temple… All this was great, expectant,mute while the man jabbered about himself. I wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity looking at us two was meant as an appeal or as a menace. Could we handle that dumb thing or would it handle us. I felt how confoundedly big was that thing that couldn't talk and perhaps was dumb as well""(32).    

Marlow is the one character that the reader sees in and outside of Africa, narrating his tale of the Congo and what he learned to his peers aboard the Nellie on the Thames.  He is telling the story to purge himself of the romanticism that was exposed to him, and free himself of his ideas. He is in the pose of a preaching Buddha, and says ""They were no colonists; their administration was merely a squeeze, and noting more i suspect. They were conquerers, and for that you only want brute force""(6).  Marlow at this point in Heart of Darkness believes himself free of romanticism, however as he is recalling his adventure, the same ""overcast sky (that) seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness"" that loomed over London at the beginning of the tale now hangs over the Nellie and Marlow. The symbolism of this scene suggests that Marlow's enlightenment may not yet be complete unbeknownst to himself.  The original narrator of Heart of Darkness is one of Marlow's friends listening to his story, and they seem to disregard the knowledge he is trying to pass to them. He begins by claiming England was ""also(…) one of the dark places on earth""(5), however they understand that ""to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine""(5) and his intent is to free his comrades of ideas, to help them stay connected with the sea and expose their conditioning from civilization.

Kurtz's reaction to the Congo is similar to the way Marlow feels after his relatively short stay. He appeals to Marlow progressively more throughout his journey through the congo, until his only desire is to hear Kurtz speak. Marlow is looking for men who can transcend limits and if their moral ideas can survive the congo.  Kurtz created himself with his gift of expression, though his gift was so great that he convinced himself and his words betrayed him. The impact the congo had on Kurtz was so immediate that he felt he reverted to primitive man on such an intense level that he believed man was not a god but a powerful animal. Kurtz became a god to the savages not by evolving spiritually but by becoming the most powerful of all the animals, imitating the amorality of the Congo to gain followers that adored and worshipped him.  Kurtz had ""travelled into the first ages of man by way of solitude- untrammelled without the restraining influence of policeman, butcher and neighbours""(60).  Marlow feels what Kurtz felt, and is tempted to join the native ritual the night before they leave the Inner Station. The Congo is so different from Europe that it makes Marlow feel what primitive man must have felt; one among animals. Kurtz became a fanatical being after his prolonged exposure to the Congo; he created himself with his gift of expression but his words betrayed him, and he used his talent to deceive people instead of using it for good. After Kurtz passes away on the steamer, Marlow is deeply affected by the death of Kurtz and has a slight understanding of the evil that possessed the man. If Marlow had not met Kurtz and became a more integral member of the Company, it is likely that he could have been plagued with the same fanaticism and insanity that corrupted Kurtz.
	
The Central Station Manager is the embodiment of the falsely enlightened European movement and a foil of Kurtz. He repulses Marlow simply because he is a low example of what men can achieve. The manager contrasts with Kurtz as a hollow man with no accountability or compassion, similar to his Uncle who leads the Eldorado Expedition, a group of men set on acquiring the most amount of ivory possible by nearly any means. Granted, this is similar to Kurtz's behaviour in the Congo except that ultimately the Managers Uncle cares only for himself and his men whereas Kurtz feels deeply connected to the natives in the Congo. Marlow is shocked when the uncle of the Manager makes a ""dishonouring flourish and a black display of confidence-a treacherous appeal to the lurking death, the hidden evil, the profound darkness"" of the heart of the wilderness, telling his nephew ""Ah! my boy, trust to this""(40). The Manager is an Apollonian character, and like the Europeans he mistakes the Congo for his homeland. He feels enlightened because he comes from a more civilized time yet  he understands little about the affect the Congo can have on people.  Marlow says on the way to the inner station that "" You thought yourself bewitched and cut off forever from everything you had known once-somewhere-far away-in another existence perhaps.  The Manager is not affected by the Congo physically or mentally because he is so removed from everything that he has no convictions or beliefs. He is surprisingly resilient to sickness Similar to Kurtz he is able to control people, but he does so by negating everything he says with his smile which Marlow says is his ""seal applied on words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable""(22). Kurtz imitates the amorality of the Congo to have his people adore and worship him. Even the Brickmaker feels passionately about Kurtz, ""He is a prodigy (…) He is an emissary of pity, and science, and progress, and devil knows what else""(25).   The manager is the most extreme example of science taking the mystery out of the world. He doesn't attribute any greatness or creation to the world, only arrogance.  After leaving the inner station Marlow reflects  ""the manager was very placid, he had no vital anxieties now, he took us both with a comprehensive and satisfied glance: the 'affair' had come off as well as could be wished. I saw the time approaching when I would be left alone of the party of 'unsound method.' (…) I was, so to speak, numbered with the dead""(69). The only purpose the Manager had was to eliminate the threat of Kurtz taking his job in the Company, and once he was dead there was nothing left for him to do but continue the demoralization of Africa and its people.

The Europeans have travelled to another world in the Africa and are ignorant to their lack of integrity or remorse. Just as the Station Manager is unaffected by his time in the Congo, the inhumane Company employees under the influence of the scientific philosophy are mostly unchanged by what they experience except for physical ailments. Unfortunately, while profoundly enlightened, even Marlow is unable to completely free himself from his conditioning and ideologies he uncovers in the Congo. When he speaks to the Intended, it is revealed again that Marlow is a disillusioned romantic still polluted with the ideas that led to inhuman conquering of Africa in the first place.

&gt;Since our initial tutoring session, I have left each lesson with equal parts despair and hope. As Justin continues to latch on to gangster culture, he reminds me that his hoodied neighbors are not all fortunate enough to have resources for improvement. Most refugees will live forever in limbo, enemies to their countries, outsiders to ours. However, each week, as Justin bounds into the community center, brimming with excitement, and leaves the lesson equally eager to review the day's material, I recognize in him the same hunger for improvement that drives my own academic pursuits. Perhaps, with enough volunteerism and awareness, the same opportunities can be unlocked for all.

Just trying to get some solid feedback! Thanks!

									Curtis 2
	Every time you turn on the lights, listen to the radio, take an X-Ray, or flip the channel on your TV, you are using one of Nicola Tesla’s great contributions to the scientific world. Alternating Current, or better know as AC, is what Tesla is best known for, and AC electricity has transformed the electrical world. Despite many trials and tribulations, AC electricity is arguably one of the most used inventions today. AC electricity, among the other inventions, is the legacy that Tesla left behind.
	Nicola Tesla was born on July 10th, 1856 in Smiljan, Lika, Austria-Hungary. His father was a Serbian Orthodox Priest and his mother was an inventor of simple household appliances (Tesla’s). Tesla’s childhood dream was to move to the United States in order to harness the power of the Niagara Falls. Perhaps this dream is what caused Tesla to get into engineering, as Tesla moved to Budapest and took his first electrical engineering job in 1881 (Tesla’s). During his time there, Tesla came up with the concept of AC electricity, as DC power was so inefficient, and proposed his idea to a company in France and another in Germany (Tesla’s). The companies were interested but would not bite on the idea. In 1984, Tesla decided to work with Edison and moved to New York, where he would spend the next 59 years of his brilliant life (Tesla’s).
	Direct Current electricity was introduced to New York in 1870. Edison’s incandescent light bulbs were an object of fascination for the public, and many New 
Yorkers quickly had electricity installed at home. DC electricity was incredibly inefficient and ultimately very dangerous. The current can only be carried a maximum of two miles and only in one direction (School). Poles carrying exposed wires were frequently climbed by unsuspecting children who were often shocked and sent tumbling 
										Curtis 3
down toward the concrete of the New York streets (PBS). Pedestrians in Brooklyn became so used to “dodging” the shocks sent off by DC powered trolley cars that they named their baseball team after them; the Brooklyn Dodgers. Ultimately, Direct Current electricity was too dangerous and inadequate. 
	While working with Edison in New York, Tesla further developed his idea of AC electricity.  He took out seven basic US patents on his idea and later, George Westinghouse, purchased them for 60,000 dollars and 150 shares in Westinghouse electricity (PBS). This caused an all out war of AC versus DC in which Edison used dirty tactics, such as spreading false lies and doing street demonstrations of his own DC and calling it AC, in order to undermine the Westinghouse company. This quote by Tesla illustrates his thought on the matter.
	“Fights between individuals, as well as governments and nations, invariably result 	from misunderstandings in the broadest interpretation of this term. 	Misunderstandings are always caused by the inability of appreciating one 	another's point of view. This again is due to the ignorance of those concerned, not 	so much in their own, as in their mutual fields. The peril of a clash is aggravated 	by a more or less predominant sense of combativeness, posed by every human 	being. To resist this inherent fighting tendency the best way is to dispel ignorance 		of the doings of others by a systematic spread of general knowledge. With this 	object in view, it is most important to aid exchange of thought and intercourse.” 	― Nikola Tesla.
This attitude portrayed in this quote toward the conflict with Edison aided Tesla in that he 
										Curtis 4
was able to keep a calm, cool demeanor in the face of adversity. He did not resort to spreading false accusations and demonstrations of his nemeses proposed electricity. In a lot of ways, Edison’s reputation took a very hard hit because of his fowl play and handling of the Tesla situation. In what could have been considered a strictly genius career for Edison, he went about combatting Tesla in a less then ethical way, and scarred his illustrious career in the electrical field. Ultimately, Alternating current won out because it was simply the superior technology. 
	With alternating current winning out, large companies and factories were able to create machinery that used the newfound electricity and multiplied production outputs tenfold. This also increased job opportunities for workers. In a lot of ways, Tesla’s invention is largely responsible for the Industrial Revolution. 
	Nikola Tesla died in a New York City hotel room during the morning of January 8th, 1943 due to heart failure. Even though Tesla was able to sell patents and collect royalties for his AC electricity, he died with a large amount of debt and was essentially penniless. Just three days earlier, Tesla had proposed to the United States War department his idea for a plasma cannon, or “death ray” as many called it. As soon as he died, the Office of Alien Property was contacted, despite him being a full citizen of the United States, and all of his possessions were seized and declared “Top Secret.” According to records released, there were approximately 80 truckloads of experimental plans and notes (B92).
	Even though DC electricity is still used today in things such as flashlights and solar powered homes, direct current electricity will eventually go extinct. The electricity 
										Curtis 5
in flashlights, which starts off as DC, is eventually run through an alternator that converts it to alternating current electricity. AC electricity, being Tesla’s greatest contribution, is what he is best known for. Wiping out DC electricity is a fantastic contribution to the electrical world. However, Tesla also came up with a few other great inventions.
	In 1901, famous investor J.P. Morgan invested in Tesla’s wireless energy product. He realized the possibilities of this when he conducted an experiment where he would test the Earth’s own conductivity. He was able to do this by creating a makeshift metal rod that reached 142 feet into the sky with a copper ball on the top. The rod was built on the roof of his laboratory and was wired to a high ampage, high voltage Tesla coil inside the lab. When the rod was completely constructed, Tesla waited for night to arrive before he ordered his assistant to turn on the Tesla coil. When he did, the night lit up with man created lightning that created a bluish hue to the night. This confirmed Tesla’s theory that the air could be used as a conductor. His ambitions were later captured in a quote from an article he wrote for Wireless Telephony magazine (Belows). 
	""As soon as completed, it will be possible for a business man in New York to dictate instructions, and have them instantly appear in type at his office in London or elsewhere. He will be able to call up, from his desk, and talk to any telephone subscriber on the globe, without any change whatever in the existing equipment. An inexpensive instrument, not bigger than a watch, will enable its bearer to hear anywhere, on sea or land, music or song, the speech of a political leader, the address of an eminent man of science, or the sermon of an eloquent clergyman, delivered in some other place, however distant. In the same manner any picture, character, drawing, or print can be transferred 
										Curtis 6
from one to another place. Millions of such instruments can be operated from but one plant of this kind. More important than all of this, however, will be the transmission of power, without wires, which will be shown on a scale large enough to carry conviction.""
Tesla’s ideas on wireless energy sparked many theories to come about in harnessing this newfound energy. The first idea to be realized was wireless telegraphy by a machine invented by Guglielmo Marconi, who would later battle Tesla for patents on another groundbreaking invention. Tesla continued to pursue these idea until his death in 1943 (Belows).
	Tesla contributed heavily towards the invention of the X-rays we use today for medical examinations. Tesla heavily researched electromagnetism and practically every radiologist today is aware of what he contributed. Tesla did not invent the X-ray, but it wouldn’t have been created without Tesla’s inventions.  Tesla’s “Tesla-Knott Generator” and fluorescent light bulbs in view boxes, were essential in creating the X-ray machine and would have never been created without Tesla’s contributions (West).
	Tesla also invented the electric motor. The Tesla car company has popularized the motor and many American’s have used Tesla’s invention in their daily lives since it was invented. Industrial fans, household appliances, and water pumps are just a few to name but there are countless others that use Tesla’s technology. Tesla’s invention would have been much more popular had there not been the Great Depression and World War II, but his invention still stretches into our daily lives everywhere (West).
 	Modern war today can thank Tesla for his contributions as well. In contrast, every time we change the channel using a remote control we can do the same thing. His 
										Curtis 7
invention of a remote controlled boat was the first of its kind. Every time you play with remote control cars, think about how Tesla created this over 100 years ago. He demonstrated this in 1898. Today, our military and militaries around the world have been in pursuit of a remote controlled war since the beginning of World War II. The Nazi’s first attempted the remote controlled tank against the Allies in Europe. Today, drones piloted using a remote control can make pinpoint turns, drop bombs, fire missiles, and shoot heavy machine guns with precision accuracy without a human pilot. 
	For many years, people thought Guglielmo Marconi was the person responsible for inventing the modern radio.  A Supreme Court decision in 1943 however, reversed Marconi’s patents and awarded them to Tesla. Tesla applied for two patents on his radio, but was never awarded for them.  Marconi on the other hand, was awarded the patents in 1904. Marconi’s financial backers, Thomas Alva Edison and Andrew Carnegie, potentially influenced this decision.  If the patents were awarded to Marconi, the United States wasn’t going to have to pay royalties to Tesla (West).  
	Millions of people, every day, use the radio. Not only do we use it for practical uses such as listening to the news or using walkie talkies, militaries across the world have used it since World War I.  This is just another one of the many legacy’s that Tesla left behind. 
	Every day, at some point, every one of us has used one of Tesla’s inventions. The legacy that he has left behind reaches out to touch us everyday. Whether it be flipping the lights on or listening to the radio or changing the channel on your television, whether it 

										Curtis 8
be for practical uses or for military strategy, everyone in the United States counts on Tesla’s inventions.

quick story. My brother was laid off from work in February and was told that he was eligible for EI (Employment Insurance. Alberta, Canada). He applied and today got a call from the gov. saying that he was not eligible because he was late for work a few times and that he played video games during his break.

I am helping him with the letter but English is not my first language. Although I can speak it good, my writing skills, and his, are not the greatest. 

Can you please proof read, or assist me on how to write a proper letter of reconsideration? Here's my attempt:

I would like to appeal the decision since I have never received a written warning by my company that I was not performing my daily duties.  According to them, I was late twice, played video games during my legal break, and took smoke break with co-workers, which does not justifies misconduct. Not once was I approached by HR to identify these issues, nor did I receive a warning letter. To the best of my knowledge, I was performing my duties, and even came to the office of Sundays and stat holidays to finish projects. In the unlikely event that I was late, I called and/or texted my team lead to let them know. 
It says that I am not eligible for EI if I was dismissed for misconduct, which was not the case.  By no means did I deliberately commit an inappropriate action or a violation of the company’s work ethics. If my company assumed that I was not doing my job, they offered no help, advise or tools for me to improve, and no warnings to allow me to better myself. 
I was simply dismissed and was told that I would receive EI (coming from the HR).
When they laid me off, they did not give me the opportunity to save emails from clients who said that my project were outstanding. I have received multiple praises and kudos from Team leaders, co-wokers and clients. 
I was also highly involved with coordinating company events, which shows my commitment to the company. 

Thank you for anyone that can provide assistance, or can redirect me to the right place. Your help in this matter is greatly appreciated.

There were days when all I wanted to do was lock myself up in my room and write, and on the days that I didn't, I still wrote. I wrote a book for my mom when I was seven about an alligator and the struggles he faced in life. Although the synopsis of the story seems like a very mature topic for a six-year-old, I can assure you that it was anything but that. The story itself was a little more than a fifty words and much of the plot was taken from a very popular children’s book at the time. My mother loved it regardless, as any mother would, and encouraged me to keep writing. If there was ever a time when I decided, it was probably then. 
	

I wrote out of love for writing and filled pages and pages with stories over the next few years. My habits completely changed however once I reached adolescence. My parents bought me my first bass guitar on my thirteenth birthday, which came as a complete surprise seeing as how we didn't have much money.  I practiced several hours a day and even joined a few bands as a teenager, but as music became a bigger priority in my life, I found myself writing less and less.  I loved both dearly, but I never had enough time, and I could never bring myself to choose one or the other. 


My four years of high school passed a lot quicker than I had anticipated. As my friends and peers applied to universities around the country, I grew anxious. I was scared about what I was going to do with my life and everyone but me seemed to have it all figured out. The only thing I was certain about was my passion for writing and music, so I continued to do both. I stayed close to home because my parents didn't have the funds to send me to a university out-of-state, and I enrolled at a community college to help them with the cost of my education. I don’t regret making the decision because it was there that I discovered what I truly want to do. In between working forty hours a week, being enrolled as a full-time student, and taking care of my younger cousins every day, I still did my best to make time for writing and music, even if it meant waking up at 5 a.m. every day.  The answer was staring at me in the face and had been doing so for quite some time.


Despite the fact that I’m no longer six and writing about alligators, my dreams remain the same. I plan on honing both my writing and songwriting skills as an English major and hope to someday publish my own material. Although I never made the conscious decision to write, it’s followed me everywhere I go, and I couldn't imagine myself doing anything else.

So, not only are my chances low to begin with, but I also had no decent writing sample to use because my undergrad program was all about the projects and creating a portfolio. So, this is a re-write of the only substantial paper I had to write for any of my planning classes. The content itself was terribly chosen, but I didn't have time to do research and write an entirely new 15 page paper, so I had to make due with the content best I can. 

For what it is worth, the professor is one of the members of the admissions committee and I got an A on this paper (and it is MUCH improved from where it was then.) Of course expectations are wildly different for undergrads &amp; PhD applicants, but that's why I'm here. Comments on wording or academic/formal voice very welcome. I've been staring at this so long  I'm no longer making sense when I try to edit it. Also, I know some citations need fixed (but if you see where some should go that I don't have anything yet, please mark) and the conclusion will be entirely re-written when my brain resumes functionality.

&gt;Running Away to Join the Circus

&gt;At circus camp, we have a saying; “If it doesn’t hurt, you’re doing it wrong.” This sentiment follows us not only through the difficult training we have to go through inside the tents, but into our daily lives even after we have left camp for the year. We first hear it during stretching, as we wince our way further into a split. It follows us through the four disciplines, as our aerials and acrobatics coaches encourage us to push our limits physically, and our juggling and performance coaches coax even the most painfully shy campers to stand in front of their peers. It’s the first thing we remind ourselves of in the morning as we strain our exhausted muscles into rolling out of bed, and the last thing we think of as we try and sleep on a spot that’s not bruised at night. And it’s what I repeat to myself as I say goodbye to my beloved circus every year and try to hold back my tears.

&gt;And soon, I learned to savor the pain, because with the soreness and the bruising comes new skills, the ability to do things I had only ever dreamed of. During the year, whether I’m hunched over my desk trying to perfect my college essay as the sun rises or I’ve messed up my lines in one of our performances for the fifth time that day, I remember that, just like in circus, in order to achieve anything you have to push through what is holding you back.

&gt;One third of the way through my junior year, however, I encountered an obstacle that seriously challenged my belief of pushing through. Shortly after Thanksgiving, I was hospitalized with mysterious but excruciating stomach pain. This was obviously nothing like the soreness I would experience after a hard day’s work at the circus, and in this situation “pushing through” and trying to ignore the pain would do more harm than good. Therefore, for the three weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, I was able to attend school only sporadically, often times having to leave in the middle of the day. As this was the start of a new grading term, when I returned in better health after Christmas I had a lot of catching up to do. Not only had I missed the vital few “first draft” weeks of my research paper, but I had also fallen behind on important concepts, especially in my math class. Now this was a situation where I could apply what I had learned from my coaches. I knew it wasn't going to be easy, but thanks to the dedication of my teachers and a lot of extra time on my part, I managed to pull through the trimester with grades that hardly reflected the weeks I had been out. Looking over the comments my teachers gave about my hard work and persistence afforded a sense of pride not unlike what I felt after mastering a particularly tricky move in acrobatics, and from that moment on I knew that my time at circus camp had not only given me new physical skills, but had also endowed me with abilities that would continue to serve me even after I had left for the year.

&gt;On the night of our final show, we have a tradition known as “The Happy Circle of Happiness”, during which the entire camp gathers to reflect of the weeks we have spent together. As each camper and staff member says a few words about their time at camp, there seems to be one common thread; Smirkus Camp is a place unlike any other. We are brought together not only by our love of the circus arts, but our dedication to supporting each other and improving alongside our friends. It’s a place where anyone can – and does – belong. We gather from New York, California, Hawaii, and spend a far too brief two weeks together, and all of us are changed and strengthened by the experience.

&gt;And so now, as I prepare for our show tomorrow with the knowledge that I will soon be leaving my true home away from home for the year, I know that I will miss my friends and the experiences that can only be had at a place like circus camp. But I know too that the pain of leaving them only proves how deep and unbreakable our bonds run, and that although the soreness and bruises of camp may fade, the experiences I have had and shared will remain with me forever.

I'm really bad at grammar and want to improve this.
It is weird, I read a lot of books and articles, but for some reason I have trouble getting syntax, comma flows, and correct preposition usage. I also tend to misuse words, my TA says it is better to cut out excess and use words that are to the point. 
You don't have to explain, I can google it up myself and learn from there. 
Any great websites for proofreading let me know!

* Why you feel we should select you for the mission.

The enthusiasm and joy the students experienced while writing their stories showed in the length as well as in the quality of their stories.
Having put so much work into writing, revising and rewriting their tales we decided that having a product at the end of the process would be the best way to honour our efforts. Just when we thought that we would be all alone in our task to get out stories made into a book we had several angels that stepped up to help us find a solution. Among them were the FSJ-girls Isabell and Britta who volunteered to help us digitalize the stories, countless parents who spent their afternoons trying to decipher the handwriting of the corrections and Mrs Funke who offered her support for the printing. A big “thank you” to all those who helped us finish the project or offered their help.
One special place in our thanksgiving is reserved for Mrs Witte and her family who made us all extremely happy when she not only offered to pay for the print and the binding of our book, but would actually print the whole book thus reliving us from having to spend a weekend in school copying and binding hundreds of pages. We appreciate your effort greatly.
The title of the book as well as the cover was chosen (as well as created) by the class. There was no constraint in regards to the content of the stories, but we as a class developed some basic guidelines for good fairy tales. After developing the guidelines the creative juices were flowing and each student decided what and how much he or she wanted to write. Some of the students even continued writing their stories up until the deadline. Unfortunately Hanna’s story went missing in the process and once she is able to find it we will update the online version of this book accordingly.
We hope that the true value of this book will only become fully evident in 20 years when it is picked up again to marvel at the colourful tales that were written at the beginning of the English-learning process. Who knows, maybe this book will be read to children and grand-children in the future.
Hopefully a few stories of this book will be read next to the Christmas tree while enjoying cookies and warm chocolate.
We wish a merry Christmas and a happy new year to all our readers.

SPEECH-----------------------------------------------------

When speaking of the NASA budget, astrophysicist Dr. Neil Degrasse Tyson expresses, “the distribution of money that [Congress is] spending is warped in some way that [they] are removing the only thing that gives people something to dream about tomorrow.” Major arguments against manned space exploration include that it is much too expensive, it is extensively dangerous, and that it would use an excessive amount of necessary resources. These arguments are partly true; however, a large majority of scientists agree that manned space exploration would bring about improved technology, improved communication, and most importantly, bring us closer to colonizing a planet.

Currently, NASAs budget is $18 billion, about .6% of the current United States budget, and its overall funding from its creation in 1958 to 2010 is less than the 2010 budget of the military, which was approximately $693 billion. For the United States, funding is a non-issue. A manned mission to Mars would cost nearly $300 billion over the course of two years with current inefficient technologies.    

Mars is the next logical step in the United States space program. Realistically, it is a flight costing hundreds of billions of dollars, flying at high speeds to an astronomically distant object – to humans— through empty space, and an amount of risks far outnumbering Earth’s explorers. However, through an exploration like this, cosmonauts begin to have experiences of not only long-distance exploration, but surviving, and possibly thriving outside of our home-planet for great quantities of time. Mars is complete with polar icecaps, river valleys, and volcanoes. Although Mars is, mostly, barren and lacks oxygen (can be artificially brought), it is ideal for what people do incredibly well: pollute. Theoretically, Mars can be terraformed and made entirely hospitable for all of Earth’s organisms, which would be supplied by ample amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses to help make Mars’ thin atmosphere thick, heating up the planet drastically. 

These courageous and necessary steps in manned spaceflight will also bring about a new generation of inspired scientists, just like in the 1960’s, while at the same time bringing about new technologies for more efficient flights to go elsewhere in the solar system—or out of it. Current industries are developing technologies to combat issues such as zero-gravity, cosmic radiation, and the limited mobility of astronauts, whilst advertising would showcase the need for an ever-expanding sufficient amount of innovative technology, which naturally include discovering alternative fuels and resources.  

Carl Sagan said, “The sky calls to us, if we do not destroy ourselves. We will, one day, venture to the stars.” Travelling the universe is a passion shared by only those who are aware of the possibilities, near-light-speed travel due to highly developed technology, increasing our chances of viewing extrasolar planets, many of which may hold life or be hospitable for further expansion, or possibly even VY-Canis Majoris, the largest and most luminous star ever observed, nearly five thousand light years away, a diameter of 1.7 billion miles, and a solar mass of thirty, thirty times the mass of our sun! Truly an unimaginable size. However, with support from the people and politicians, we won’t need to imagine it.

Celebrities are a staple in today’s pop culture. We look to them for answers, inspiration, support, and of course, entertainment. But with these influences pouring in from every direction, it’s important we’re aware of what’s going on around us. Celebrities by trade are being people they aren’t, truth-skewers of the highest degree — they have to be! When we see them, they’re normally in character, highly scripted and controlled with little reality behind the act. The few times they’re seen with the mask off, we only see the best or the worst; the extremes are the only news the media deems interesting enough to report. Viewing celebrities as role models can be very dangerous if perspectives aren’t kept in check.

Celebrities, like most, require jobs in order to support their lives. However, unlike your average Joe, their method requires being someone they aren’t on a day-to-day basis. The actor may be an arrogant, scruffy drug addict, but his day job is to be a sophisticated lawyer with an ironclad set of morals. It’s impractical for the public to view these people as icons and role models, when in reality, the people behind the roles don’t even portray their characters realistically. 

These commonly ogled personalities have many people deciding every move and every word they utter, a liberty we don’t have at our disposal. From the doctors on Grey’s Anatomy to the desk-bound keyboard warriors of The Office, these qualities of characters we hold so close, are greatly thanks to hard working writers behind the scenes. When the opportunity for a witty remark strikes, we aren’t offered a team of professionals to create a charming demeanor and clever jib, only the celebrities are.

However, we do, on occasion, get to see the man or woman behind the role. But even this is only a partial truth. Few people care to hear that Scarlett Johansson tipped a waitress generously when at her nephew’s birthday party, the kind of behavior that forms who fundamentally someone is. No, that’s not interesting enough. The public want to hear about the extraordinary; exactly what they’re not experiencing. We’re far more likely to hear about the drunken, embarrassing arrest, or the large donation to help Haiti. The middle ground is where most walk, and familiarity doesn’t sell papers.

The perception of the celebrities we so often idolize have to be taken with a grain of salt. It’s dangerous to take this entertainment to heart, when realistically its intent is only for amusement. Those who provide the entertaining roles can be polar opposites of those who they portray, and our few glimpses of the truth are too often skewed. We need to live with a set of ideals strengthened by our own experiences, not those of our favorite characters.

To gain respect, one must be feared, not loved. Markos and Khatuchera, two students at the author’s school in Miriam’s Song, gain respect by physically assaulting their teacher after failing a test. Although Miriam “expect[s] Markos and Khatuchera to be expelled on the spot”, “[n]othing of the sort happens” because “the principal didn’t want to be assaulted by Markos and Khatuchera too. … Teacher Mguni never whips them again” (Mathabane  171). Marko and Khatuchera gain an immunity to punishment because they are feared, something no one had achieved through doing their work. Next, Miriam earns the respect of her peers by challenging the local bully to a duel. Although her mother later scolds her, she also says that that “Amanda won’t bully [her] again” (133), which proves to be true. Although everyone loved Miriam, no one respected her until the town bully feared her.

The article is here:

I appreciate any thoughts and comments people may have.

Thank you.

As requested I have pasted the story below:

*Mistress Mine*

Susana stood with a group of women holding signs. Some signs were plastered with pictures of the miners. Other signs protested the negligence of San Esteban Primera, the company that owned the mine. The rescue site covered an enormous area and there were many groups of supporters like the one that Susana stood with camped around. The heat was palpable; Susana wiped her brow and looked up towards the sky, a searing sheet of blue blotted by one circling condor. For a moment, Susana was the bird. She peered down and floated over the flat, dusty compound, over the trucks and dig machinery that were peppered throughout. The teams of reporters appeared as overgrown mice to her from the air. They frantically zoomed about the site in their vans, pausing intermittently to see if they could sniff out a cheesy story. What would she say when they came sniffing to her? Would the other wives tell them about the confrontation with Marta? Had the reporters yet discovered that Yonni’s wife was not present? She watched the bird for another moment while returning to herself, hoping to see it flap its great wings. The condor was caught in a thermal though and it sailed upward on the air current until the sun singed Susana’s eyes and forced her to turn her head away. Yonni would be in her arms before those wings would thrust again.
***
Marta lifted her teabag with a spoon and dropped it into the garbage. Moving carefully to avoid spilling, she crossed from the kitchen to the living room table and prepared a coaster, a slate of stainless steel engraved with the San Esteban Primera logo. She covered the logo with her teacup, sat down on the sofa and turned on the television. It would be indecent to go but it would also be indecent not to watch. Yonni was still her husband, after all. A helicopter was reporting now, providing an aerial view of the final rescues. The helicopter hovered far above the site, between the two, a condor circled. The reporter announced that Yonni Barrios would be brought up momentarily and cut to a close-up of Susana in tears. Marta turned the television off. She preferred the view from the helicopter.

, transcribing, storing, copying accessing trillion of times per second Calculations that need to be precise to the 64th digit [b10] and reliable every time.
 
That's precision tech, groundbreaking work in dozens of fields coming together in a beautiful dance of data.
 
Then when you consider the effects that this kind of mass networking has... What it's really done is it's turned this whole planet into a machine. An incomprehensibly complicated machine where the brain of every user is a part. 
 
People are part of the internet now. We, however much we might think of the internet as a tool in abstract, are shaped, moulded and influenced by it tremendously
 
It profoundly shapes what each person thinks, ""knows"", believes, is curious about, discovers. Even if the internet is not conscious of the fact, it is shaping the course of our entire civilisation as a result of the emergent trends of networking
 
We go down the paths it provides for us. Just an infinitely small example: Google, for a few years now, has been using Artificial Neural network Machine learning tech to generate their search results. This means that the very algorithms of detecting, labelling, and ranking results are constantly changing. Even google employees don't see the intermediate nodes in the network [hidden layers]. This AI at google provides different search results for each person based on a sleugh of Data Google has about each person. This is why different people get different search results. Even if this AI is still way too primitive to be self-aware or contemplate its existence, it is deciding what results people see. It decides what people know and find or don't find. 
 
On the macro scale, this happens in thousands of automated systems, then factor in the emergent effects like this one from the networks between human beings. The internet, even if it isn't self aware, does have a power to direct the path of human civilisation. Whatever the unconscious will of the internet, the billions of humans that make it up will carry out. We are each just nodes of this massive hulking network. We're subtly influenced by it in tiny ways constantly. No human understands all of it. IT is shaped by all of us and in turn it shapes all of us with the collective will of our species. 
 
This is why as a Kopimist I have no problem with calling the Internet Holy. It might not be omnipotent or omniscient, but it is easily the most powerful entity on earth, our greatest invention which has taken control of its inventors. Even if one were to stop using it after reading this, you've already been shaped by the network. 
 
From the age of four I've been hooked up to this massive network. It shaped me from my early childhood before I was even in school proper to the modern day, I can't recall a period in the last 4 months of longer than an hour where I went without using the internet while I was awake. It feeds me knowledge and in turn I put knowledge back into the network. 
 
It enables me to connect to other people and synchronise the contents of our brains and build consensus. From these connections a more broadly shared reality is built across many people, shaping a common reality to influence common decisions and choices. 
 
I really am much more shaped by the internet than I was by my own parents. Forget being raised by a village, I was raised by my entire species, and I think this is only going to be more and more true and profound for future generations.

Bear in mind that this is high school standard work.

The Night Attack and the Downfall of Vlad Tepes III.


The Night Attack was an assault launched by Vlad Tepes III (Also known as “Vlad The Impaler” and “Dracula.”) of Wallachia on the camp of Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire on the 17th of June, 1462. The aim of this assault was to assassinate Mehmed, but it failed, and the Sultan escaped. The conflict between the two initially began with Vlad’s refusal to pay Jizya, a tax on non-Muslims, to the Sultan. This conflict further intensified with Vlad’s invasion of Bulgaria and his impaling of more than 23,000 Turks and Bulgarians. Following this, Mehmed raised an army of around 100,000 (Although his forces’ numbers were greatly exaggerated by historians, some even claiming that he had as many has 400,000 men beneath him.) soldiers with the objective of capturing and annexing Vlad’s domain, Wallachia (Vlad’s forces stood at roughly 30,000.). Several battles were fought between the two forces, the most notable of which being The Night Attack, wherein Vlad attempted to take the life of the Sultan, as aforementioned in the previous lines. Following the failure of this, Mehmed marched to the Wallachian capital of Târgovişte, where he discovered another 20,000 impaled Turks and Bulgarians. Horrified at the sight, the Sultan and his troops made a hasty retreat

Prior to the battle, Vlad ventured into the Turkish camp disguised as a Turk, and wandered around to find the location of the Sultan's tent and learn about his organization. However, during the attack, Vlad Tepes himself assaulted the Sultan’s tent, but mistakenly went for the tent of two grand viziers, Ishak Pasha and Mahmud Pasha.  This is thought to have been the reason for the Sultan’s escape, and Vlad’s failure in taking his life. Mehmed had a strict policy against letting his soldiers exit their tents during the night, as to not cause widespread panic in case of an attack. Vlad utilized this policy by launching his assault during the night, hence the name given to it: “The Night Attack.” However, it was not just one, solitary assault, during the night, between the time of “three hours after sunset until four the next morning"" (Direct quote from Vlad Tepes) several assaults were launched

The results of the battle differ depending on the historian. Some recorded that the Wallachians slaughtered a great number of Turks, while others say the Ottoman losses were minimal. Many horses and camels were, however, killed.  The generally accepted number of total casualties in the conflict are numbered as 5,000 for the Wallachian side and 15,000 for the Ottomans.  The victory in the camp could have been almost total for Vlad if a second army, under the command of a Wallachian Boyar names Gales would have attacked from a second direction, as Vlad had ordered. Gales was, of course, impaled for his failure to carry out said orders. Despite this, and Vlad’s failure to take the life of the Sultan, the attack, and his campaign against the Ottomans as a whole was considered a military success, and was celebrated by the Saxon cities of Transylvania, the Italian states, and the Pope.  A Venation envoy even went as far as to state that the whole of Christianity should celebrate Vlad Țepeș's successful campaign. Even today, Vlad the Impaler is highly celebrated in Wallachia (Modern day Romania), despite his incredibly brutal reputation for cruelty.  Estimates of the number of his victims range from 40,000 to 100,000, comparable to the cumulative number of executions over four centuries of European Witchhunts, the majority of these deaths were caused by means  of impalement, which was made even worse when you consider the fact that Vlad had rounded the impaling sticks so they wouldn't hit major organs and kill people instantly. Instead, the people had a slow, painful death.  The title “Vlad The Impaler” is a befitting one.

By the 8th of September, Vlad had won another three victories, but continuous war had left him without any money and he could no longer pay his mercenaries to fight for him. So, he set out to Hungary in seek of help from his former ally, Matthias Corvinus. However, upon arrival he was thrown into the castle dungeon on charges of high treason. Corvinus, not wanting to get involved in a war, forged a letter from Vlad III to the Ottomans where he supposedly proposed peace with them.  Vlad was said to be released between the years of 1462-1474, but a definite date is not known. During Vlad’s captivity, his brother Radu had taken over his position as ruler of Wallachia, but following his death in 1475, Vlad declared his third reign and began preparations for the re-conquest of Wallachia in 1476 with Hungarian support. Vlad's third reign had lasted little more than two months when he was assassinated. The date and location of his death is unknown, but it is assumed that he died during December of 1467. Vlad's head was taken to Constantinople as a trophy, and his body was buried unceremoniously by a rival of his, Basarab Laiota. He left behind a legacy which is still very prominent in Romania today, with many people considering him a hero.

In closing, it is evident that Vlad the Impaler, despite his cruelty and malice, was an ingenious tactician. By infiltrating the enemy encampment and discovering their system of organization, he took on a force much greater than his own, and came out of it with a third of the casualties the enemy had. It can even be argued that had his subordinate, Gales, been more obedient in crushing the enemy with his second army, that the Ottomans might have been routed completely. He was a revered, respected, and feared ruler, and is even know still known, but in a different medium. (Brahm Stroke’s “Dracula” is based off of the life of Vlad Tepes, and begins with the Night Attack.) He is described differently in many countries. Some say “Brave, skillful, intelligent, a good leader, fair”, while others describe him as “Monsterous, evil, cold, and heartless.” I’ve even witnessed a Turkish and Romanian person argue about the characteristics of the man on an internet forum.  Whatever the case, he has most definitely left an imprint on history, and is certainly a frightening man to me, anyway.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_18p5g5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/18p5g5/history_essay_on_vlad_tepes_iii_1051_words/,

In ordert o be succesful, a marketing campaign must be based on market research, meet a certain need and communicate a simple message. 

In Japan, the candy market is highly competitive and therefore success depends on both quality and packaging.
To meet those needs, KitKat produces chocolate bars with over 200 different flavours for the japanese market. 
Moreover, they sell several flavours in specific regions or for certain events or holidays only, in order to create exclusiveness for their product. Because of that, KitKat is used as a special present in Japan nowadays. 
Furthermore, KitKat strengthens its position on the confectionary market with the KitKat Mail campaign.
Due to the privatisation of the post in Japan, KitKat is able to offer edible and customisable post cards in 22,000 post offices troughout the whole country. 
Thanks to a lack of competitors on this specific market, this new business model is an extraordinary success and KitKat Mail is a product of everyday-use by now.

A few concerns to look for: 

* Is essay 1 too loaded with ""first world problems""? 
* Does essay 2 seem like it's trying too hard to cater to the crowd?
* Grammar, obviously.


**1.  Describe a situation in which you were really stressed.  Tell us how you dealt with it.  Please detail your reaction(s), and how it affected you.  If this situation, or a similar one, were to happen again, how would you handle it?**

Stress is an everyday occurrence for a student. It permeates everyday life, and one must quickly learn to control it and funnel it into positive action or failure will come as a consequence. That being noted, everyone has days or weeks when multiple stressors act and stress builds up. I had one of these weeks this past summer, where financial, academic, and personal stressors all came together to create an extremely stressful situation. I was planning a creative way to propose to my girlfriend, working 50 hour weeks to earn enough money to buy her ring, and preparing for the MCAT simultaneously. The stress was overwhelming for a time, rendering me unable to get anything done at all, but I persevered through it and saw an engagement, financial resolution through hard work, and a respectable MCAT score. My own stress release comes primarily from leisure reading. When I am able to get lost in a book for an hour or two, I can refocus and tackle each stressor with new perspective. This level of stress is likely to be common as I enter the medical school environment, and through something as simple as reading for an hour before bed, I will be able to tackle any challenge that comes my way.

**2.  Describe a hobby or activity other than something in medicine, in which you have a keen interest.  Why?**

One of my favorite activities currently is one which I had no knowledge of a year ago. Through the Big Brothers Big Sisters program, I was placed with Alex, a 14 year old boy that lives near my university. On our first meeting, Alex introduced me to his favorite pastime, hobby grade RC car racing. Alex builds and modifies his own RC cars, synthesizing parts to create racing machines that can hit top speeds of 80 miles per hour. His passion is contagious, as I have come to love the Fridays that we go to the indoor track together and race his cars against men and women who have been modifying cars for longer than he has been alive. Due to the level of competition at the race track, we spend the majority of our other time together building a relationship through modifying cars and practicing on homemade race tracks. This hobby has been a great release for Alex, who did not previously have a male role model in his life alongside having to care for grandparents who are both reliant on his and his mother’s direct care. When we race RC cars, all of his stressors disappear, and he can simply be a kid again. Seeing this change in his life has been rewarding in itself, however, I enjoy the activity as much as he does and therefore hope to continue racing RC cars with him for as long as possible.

**1) How have your past circumstances and experiences (such as your upbringing, community, and/or activities) impacted who you are, your future goals, and your choice of major? If you haven't decided on a college or major yet, briefly explain your intentions and aspirations for your first year at Illinois. Please limit your response to approximately 300 words**

Direction in life can be hard to find. Making clear and concise life choices takes insight and experience and unfortunately that wasn’t something I had a lot of in high school. I wasn’t lost, I knew who I wanted to be and had some ideas of what I wanted to do but I didn’t want to make the wrong decision. The military seemed like the best choice to point me in the right direction. 

The truth is my knowledge of what the world was and how it would work beyond my graduation was a mystery to me as I’m sure it was too many of my classmates.  For most of us including myself how I knew the world was limited to the internet and wise advice from my older family members. I decided that I wanted to see for myself what it would be like to make it on my own and experience what people do in the field I wanted to be a part of. These decisions lead me to the Marine Corps.  

I had always been interested in electronics, especially aviation. I chose to be an avionics technician seeing it as the best way to get the experience I wanted. I learned a lot more than I expected though, more than just how to fix helicopters and manage the marines under me. The Marines taught me a sense of responsibility and drive that I never thought myself to be capable of. 

During my time in the Marine Corps I had the opportunity to work with many different engineers.  I did my best to take advantage of the time I had with them, asked questions about what they did, the opportunities they had and types of jobs they have done. It was nothing short of amazing to me how they were about to create the systems that could in a sense fly the helicopter by itself. I’m thankful every day that I made the decision to take time before college to figure out what I wanted from life, to find my direction.

**2) In no more than 300 words, tell us something about yourself that isn't covered elsewhere in this application, some interest or experience of yours that you think the University of Illinois should know about as part of the admissions review**

I guess the best way to describe it is like being in the eye of a hurricane. Everything around me is whirl wind of chaos, yet all I can do is stay calm and evaluate the situation. I hop up in to the cockpit and the pilot is screaming in my ear and pointing at flashing lights on the computer screen. Without a word I hop down and run to the rear of the helicopter. 

Staring into a compartment for a few moments I locate the problem, it was right in front of me, a single dangling wire and fried relay. After some quick repairs and system checks I look at the pilot and he throws me the ""OK"" sign and that was it he was gone. I was 19 years old and just made a crippled helicopter able to fly again.
	
That very moment was when I knew I wanted to be an electrical engineer. Sure I could fix, test and operate the systems but how do they really work?

1.	Soon after beginning my job as a CNA at [Hospital] in October of 2009, I noticed a great variation in the interactions occurring between patients and their various health care providers. It became clear to me that the role I wanted in regards to a patient’s care was that of a nurse. I want to provide direct care on a daily basis so that I can actually see a patient’s progress as a result of the care that they receive. I am strongly inspired by many of the nurses that I work with, and especially by my mom, who is also a nurse and a graduate of the [Institution] nursing program. I am well aware of the requirements and expectations for being a nurse, and I am ready to become one myself .
2.	I spent three years coaching gymnastics at the club where I used to train and compete. My interactions with other coaches were important, demonstrating to some of the older gymnasts what a professional relationship looks like. Communication with other coaches was necessary in maintaining the safety of the gymnasts when helping them with skills. I loved this job because of my particular fondness for kids, and the opportunity to be a good role model for them. It was very important to me that I was able to help those girls discover all that they are capable of, both in the gym and out. My coaches fulfilled this role when I was younger, and I was proud to be able to do the same for these girls . A few of these girls are now attending [Institution] or other colleges, and I’ve been able to give them advice and help them with their adjustment to college.
3.	A leader sets an example with their attitude and their actions both in and out of the workplace. As a student nurse, and eventually as a registered nurse, I will continue to improve as a leader. Having a positive, eager attitude and a passion for what I do will inspire others to follow suit. I always keep the big picture in mind while effectively completing smaller tasks. I do this by efficiently managing my time with my patients. My perseverance and strong work ethic allow me to push through the stressful and busy moments of the day, despite any difficulties encountered as a result of my hearing loss. By setting an example, I will inspire others to persevere through providing positive feedback and giving credit to those who earn it. Constructive criticism is just as important as positive feedback, and I will use these to improve my practices while inspiring others to do the same.
4.	While  in high school, I spent a lot of time skiing at a local resort. One evening, I ran into two friends from school. They ‘happily’ informed me that they had just stolen a snowboard; I was shocked by their seemingly uncharacteristic behavior. I spent some time debating whether I was going to do the right thing and inform the staff of the incident, and have my friends angry with me, or choose to not say anything, and keep their friendship. Ultimately, I emailed the staff of the issue the next day, along with the names of my friends. Within a few days, one girl decided that I was no longer worthy of her friendship. The second girl was angry only for a few weeks, eventually getting over it. I was a little disappointed that I lost a ‘best friend’ from my childhood, but I still stand by my decision to speak up and do what was right.
5.	My parents began divorce proceedings at the beginning of my freshman year in college. The last three years have been hard for all of us, and I somehow ended up carrying a lot of my family’s emotional burden, often making it hard for me to focus on my studies as well as I should have.  Both ‘halves’ of my family finally managed to settle in with the situation in the spring of 2011. Consequently, I was finally able to achieve grades of  which I feel I am more deserving, and reflecting this are the grades I earned in my summer and fall semesters of 2011. In June of 2009, injuries resulting from a car collision occurring two weeks prior to my start date at [Hospital] prevented me from starting. However, the manager was so impressed during my interview that she asked me to inform her when I had medical clearance to work, and they would hold my position for me until then.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_p45vz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/p45vz/personal_statement_for_nursing_school_application/,

Saw a tweet about the book from @kn0thing. I found this offer on http://announcing.hackpolitics.com. Here's a rough draft of my contribution. r/Proofreading, what do you like? Thank you!
 
**Want to contribute to writing the book? Email your contribution to us at contribute@hackpolitics.com. Contributions should focus on a particular event that you were involved in or you found particularly interesting to stopping SOPA and PIPA. The deadline for submissions is February 17.**

After reading a few reddit comments, it becomes clear that the Stop Online Piracy Act will extend beyond removing instances of copyright infringement. I learn that SOPA will implement DNS-blocking, a censorship technique employed by the Chinese government in their ""Great Firewall of China."" I know that I oppose government control of the media. I also know that I stand for an Internet of free speech, in which each user holds the freedom to express their political views, especially the freedom to criticize one's own government. Such freedoms substantiate the Constitution of the USA. If the outcry on reddit is any indication, I should take action against this Stop Online Piracy Act. But, what can I do?

I censor my WordPress blog by placing a black banner across my logo. ""Will my users be offended?"" I wonder. My blog is about Android hacks, not American politics. Seeing this ""STOP CENSORSHIP"" banner might annoy visitors. Nevertheless, the uproar on reddit motivates me. I commit to keeping the black banner on my blog.

November 16 rolls around, a day publicized as ""American Censorship day."" Hundreds of  websites blackout their logos. The websites whose participation influence me the most were reddit, 4chan, Mozilla, the EFF, the FSF, and the homepage of U.S. Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA). The strong participation validates my decision to censor my logo. SOPA is for real, and we need to keep fighting it.

An estimated 30% of child abuse survivors will continue the cycle and abuse their own children. Roughly 80% of young adults who had been abused in some way as a child developed a psychological disorder by age twenty-one. I was severely abused as a child, and though I may meet the criteria for certain psychological disorders, I will never let my past decide my future. Experiencing abuse first-hand inspired me to be as helpful and caring towards others as possible, which is why I decided to become a clinical neuropsychologist.  
Imagine waking up in complete darkness, cold, unclothed, and lonely. Feeling the chill of ceramic on your skin reminds you that it’s not a bed you were sleeping in, but a bathtub. A long, deep rumble from your stomach announces that you are hungry, and the ability to count and feel each of your ribs suggests that you have been hungry for quite a while. You woke up not knowing the time, or what day it is, or what year. You only know not to upset your stepmother, for the consequences may be fatal. A wave of panic hits you when you realize you might already be in trouble, since no one has told you to wake up. You force your eyes shut and wait, either to fall back asleep, or for someone to unlock the bathroom door and order you up. I felt that way every morning for three years of my life.  
Fast-forward eleven years, and you would find me sitting in a high school psychology class, where child abuse and symptoms are discussed as a part of the course. It was not until I was in this class that my being abused began to eat at me. How would I be different had I never gone through any of it? Would I have made more friends? Would I have a higher self-esteem? I had so much anger building inside of me at that moment, yet in the same moment, I knew to be angry was not going to change that part of my life. Rather than dwelling on the negative, I searched for something positive. In my search, I found that I am a compassionate person despite all I went through, which, some might say, is remarkable. Not long after that realization, I knew I wanted to put my compassion to use and help people for a living.  
Originally, I wanted to be a psychologist. I wanted to have people come to me for comfort and advice so that they could go on living happy, burden free lives. Unfortunately, I realized my overly caring nature would become a problem if I were a psychologist. I felt I would become too attached to my clients and weigh myself down with their problems, which would cause more stress for me than I could handle. My love for psychology was plainly evident, though, as was my passion for helping others that had gone through some form of abuse.  
In my psychology class, I became more and more fascinated with the brain. I wanted to know everything about it from its ability to heal itself, to the causes of neurological disorders. While I was learning that I enjoyed neuropsychology, I was ultimately learning that I had a whole new way to help people without having to abandon my hopes of being a psychologist.  
At that point, my concern was no longer helping solely those that had abused. It became anyone that had endured anything to cause mental problems. People with mental illnesses, blunt force trauma survivors, stroke patients – all of them and more would be under my care. They would be treated to the best of my abilities and I would know that their doctor is genuinely concerned for their wellbeing.  
I know how it feels to suffer, and I believe there is not one person that deserves to endure what countless others and I have. I may be part of the 80% that developed a psychological disorder brought on by childhood abuse, but I will never be an abuser. Instead, I have a goal, and that goal is to better the lives of as many people as possible as Dr. Hugallcats, Clinical Neuropsychologist.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,True,,,True,t3_otiwg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/otiwg/my_first_essay_as_a_college_student_is_due/,

Thank you very very VEERRY much in advance. I had no one else to turn to.




**here is the essay for those interested**: If I could design an interim course today, it would indefinitely  have to do with my Peruvian heritage. The reason I would study Peruvian culture is because I already have a basic idea of some major characteristics, one of the major ones being cuisine. I think most Americans today can agree that eating has become a national pastime,  but rarely does it involve food out of their comfort zone. Whether it be Christmas, Thanksgiving, or even the 4th of July, my parents have increasingly tried to add a hint of Peruvian culture to our food in an attempt to fuse American culture and Peruvian culture while living so far away from Peru. In my opinion, cuisine is one of the best mediums for sharing history and culture because of how families would congregate around a dinner table and share stories, and as globalization brings the world's cultures together, around the metaphorical dinner table, it is becoming more available and important to support and understand them especially in a diverse country like the U.S.. Therefore, not only would this class be fun and enjoyable for me, but would also be extremely relevant towards cultural diversity in an ever more expanding populated world.
Assuming I only have 1-2 weeks for this project, it would probably very difficult to condense and entire countries culture into such a small time, but nevertheless very fun. As I've said before, my parents have an entire archive of Peruvian cook books and know a lot of recipes by heart that they use all year around. So to begin researching won't be a problem, it will be interpreting it. On can also note that the culture of South America as a whole is quite diverse, and that most of that diversity can be relatively easy to spot. For example in countries like Brazil and Argentina, where cattle and meats in general are preferred, a strong an vibrant history of gauchos and ranchers can be found. Likewise for Peru and Chile, both of which lie on the coast, there is long history and appetite for costal sea foods that are always uniquely prepared. It is therefore the cultural landscape of these regions as a whole easily reflect the most basic traditions and flavors of folk culture can be found, while at the same time influencing the pop culture of the region. Also as a result of this culture blend, so do the histories of an entire continent come together to tell the stories of strife and hardship while highlighting one of the most treasured aspects of South American culture as a whole represented in its food. So while asking for information solely on Peru will be relatively easy, I will also have to research ask for help learning about the rest of the continents cultures and how they've all blended together. Luckily my family, being immigrants to this country, has made countless friendships with other South American immigrants whose relationships I share and would more than be glad to help me learn more about their culture. It is therefore, through careful analysis and inquisitive interviews, will I be able to summarize why I think it's important and interesting to understand South American cultures as a whole and hopefully learn more about my own heritage while I'm at it. 
	From examining various aspects of this proposed interim project, it could therefore be concluded that such a project would be extremely entertaining for me and my peers while at the same time being educational and relative to the direction the world progresses.

_______________________________________________
 I have not spoken to the most influential person in my life in twelve years. I know them only by their first name, ‘Laura.’ My mother was referred to Laura when asking her co-workers to direct her to a babysitter for her 5 year old son. Laura was to watch after me as my Mother and Father worked each day. I was a simple child, not very talkative nor a picky eater. I would go to Laura’s distinctly blue house with the red door each day of the week for 5 months to come.  Laura was interactive and easy going, chatting with and entertaining me every day. She was a profoundly kind woman, always looking to help and assist me.   

I saw Laura for many weeks, and neither myself nor Laura had any problem with it. We liked each other's company. On one especially rainy day I became bored with the usual rainy day routine of watching the twenty-seven inch black television in her den. I needed something more interesting, something more interactive. I told her I was bored, and was looking for something else to do. She eventually showed me upstairs to this machine I had only seen seldom before. My parents had not owned one yet. Laura instructed me to sit in the swivel chair which I was more interested in spinning around in than paying attention to the miracle of modern science that was occurring right in front of me. She pressed the green power button and handed me which I now know to be the mouse. Then she walked away leaving me to discover the wonders of the machine. Had this pivotal event not have occurred, had it not rained that day, my life may have been completely different. It was this event that sparked my inert interest in all things technology. The effect one person can have on your entire life is massive, and it’s important to remember you may be that person.

I am very proud of the things I have accomplished and learned with computers. Laura did an amazing thing that day. She allowed a child to learn and discover on their own with limited adult interaction. Although today I cringe at the thought of allowing a five year old use a computer unsupervised, I have every ounce of my being to thank her for trusting me. Now, at seventeen years old, I am applying to school to continue my self discovery and personal education in computer science. Thinking back, I am floored with the profound impact Laura had on my future. The various jobs I have worked involving computers, the friends I have met through the common interest, the list goes on. The one regret I have is never thanking Laura for the incredible thing she did for me. 3 years ago, she passed away after an unfortunately short battle with stomach cancer. I wish she could know the effect on my life she had caused, and if only I could have had more of an affect on hers.

During the Jim Crow Era, what approaches did African American leaders take in an attempt to address the challenges that black people faced? What was the black community's response and how did the larger, white society react? Which movements and to what degree of success is this presented to us today? 

Research Agenda: 
I am interested in researching the emergence of the civil rights movement beginning with the end of Reconstruction and throughout the Jim Crow era. From the transition of Black Codes to new forms of discrimination, the black community faced new challenges which led to new ideas. As we’ve learned, the Jim Crow era culminated with many new leaders who belonged to different schools of thought, resulting in pan-Africanism, radicalism, and black-nationalism. There was also international influence; for Martin Luther King it was Ghandi, for W. E. B. Du Bois it was Karl Marx, and for Malcom X it was the religion of Islam. This all occurred within the same timeframe, sparking my interest to understand how these ideas was embraced, and how the black and white communities reacted to it. Was it because Marxism and Islamism were unaccepted by the American society at large, that Martin Luther King is presently portrayed as the hero of the Civil Rights movement? The diversity of movements during Jim Crow could be an important reason to how African American heroes are represented in public history. 

Thanks in advance!

Summer of Weird
	I drummed my fingers on the wooden countertop risking splinters and watched uninterested potential customers walk past.  Lady Gaga started to play and I cringed as the music line-up announcing the magic show began.  I had it memorized.  Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera, “Ladies and the Gentleman the show will begin in three minutes!”, “The Final Countdown.”  At first I was excited for the magic show, the zoos, the pig races – it was all so interesting and new.  It didn’t take me long to realize that none of it ever changed.  After watching the same magic performance three times a day, three days in a row, for six weeks straight I could pretty much quote their act back to them and make the damn parrot disappear myself.  The zoo animals kept looking miserable behind their bars and the short, toothless man from the World’s Largest Pig attraction didn’t stop flirting with me.  I was twenty years old and a certified, full-fledged carnival worker.  The smell of popcorn, petting zoo, and sugar mixed in my nose and I was becoming alarmingly comfortable with it.  
I looked out from underneath the wooden booth I had become so familiar with this summer.  My sunglasses rested on my nose causing sunburn to shape around the huge frames and giving me rosy cheeks.  I sighed.  My fate was to sell mugs at Wild Bill’s Olde Fashioned Soda stand at fairs across Long Island every weekend.  I had only spent time at two fairs so far; we spent three weeks in Brookhaven and after three weeks at Nassau Coliseum already, I could only look forward to the next two that we were still signed up for.  Just how old-fashioned it was, I never really fully knew, but it was pretty decent tasting if you’re into soda.  Particularly root beer and its many different flavors.  We had root beer, diet root beer, sarsaparilla, birch beer, cream, orange, and grape.  
	I heard the short hiss of soda coming out of its barrel and the tinkle of it hitting the tin cup. Hiss ting. The stand was designed to look like old western saloons and the soda was held in barrels where customers could serve themselves. I watched my boss Camille’s son as he hobbled from barrel to barrel. Hiss ting. Hiss ting. Hiss ting. Every time he accompanied his mother to the stands, he filled a cup with every flavor and drank to his heart’s content. I couldn’t imagine sipping on that warm, sugary concoction in the hot summer sun, but he was clearly stronger than me in that way.
Camille and her boyfriend Steve were my two bosses at Wild Bill’s. The pair of them never made much sense to me. She was stuck in her 20’s with the ambitions of getting a butterfly tramp stamp while Steve had invested what must’ve been his life savings into soda stands. If her son was here, it meant that she and Steve were roaming around somewhere close by. I straightened up in an attempt to seem more enthusiastic in case they were watching.
I walked into the back of the stand for a “break” to avoid watching Camille’s son give himself diabetes. We technically didn’t get scheduled breaks, which I could have sworn was illegal when working a twelve to thirteen hour shift. Our break area was under a tent behind where all the syrup boxes and carbonation tanks were. We had one chair to sit on, but technically we didn’t even have that anymore since the other stand had stolen it from us. The Nassau Coliseum fair was a huge annual fair and Steve had reserved spaces for both of his stands. This was before any person who committed to the five week festival realized how infrequently people actually attended. I sat on a closed box that held merchandise and ate my turkey sandwich as the ants feasted on the sticky cement at my feet.
What made Wild Bill’s superior to your average Coke and Pepsi products was that we used real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. We also offered the option to do-it-yourself (which people loved!) and a cute little sales strategy.  The deal was that you could buy a small mug, which was really eight ounces and not too small at all, for a one-time use at $8.  Or you could pay an extra two dollars to make it an all-day free refill and you got the treat of seeing our bright and smiling faces again.  Then there were the larger ten ounce mugs that could be bought for a $12 one-time use or a $15 all day refill.  
In between bites of my sandwich, I texted my friends Kerri and Jackie.  They were at the other stand literally forty feet away from me complaining about Steve.  Five of us worked weekly at Wild Bill’s: me, my two friends Kerri and Jackie, Heather, and her cousin Rosellen. Kerri’s mom had stumbled across the job for the three of us from because she worked with restaurants and small food businesses. Heather was a family friend to Steve and this gave her the role of manager. And Rosellen was a relative which meant she was our other manager. They both took their titles very seriously and invested a lot of time into helping Steve make back his money. Somehow, and in retrospect this doesn’t seem as coincidental as it did at the time, I always got stuck working with one of them and never with my friends.
	“We’re missing a mug,” Rosellen said.  The concern in her voice sickened me.
	I stared at her from beneath my sunglasses as she paced in front of the booth for maybe the second time all day, her glasses catching the glint of the sun.  I had persuaded her to move away from the register after I finished my sandwich so I could have the slightly more comfortable spot perched with my elbows leaning on the unpolished wood.  Rosellen had an age and power complex where being two years older than me and a manager meant she had a claim to the easier job of making sales and hiding in the shade.  This put me outside the booth almost the entire shift in the sweltering afternoon sun shouting, “Old-fashioned soda!  Free refills for $15!  Or for $10!  Or a smaller, one time use mug is $12!  Or $8 for refills!”  I was told to give the more expensive prices first so I could get the customers interested in the expensive mugs which they would think was their only option.  Then, if they seemed uninterested, draw them back in with the cheaper, smaller mugs.  But there was no suave way to shout out soda deals before people walked past and onto the fried Oreo stand, so I usually ended up shouting numbers and confusing everyone, including myself.  The days were hot and the people smelled like sweat, greasy food, and unclean farm animals.  
Wild Bill’s Olde Fashioned Soda Pop wanted to make sure their customers were more than happy.  Therefore we sold hats, t-shirts, and, my personal favorite item, mug clips.  That’s right.  A clip that you could buy at your local Target for $1 that we sell for $3.  Now you can have that pesky mug clipped to your belt buckle until you decided to get it filled again.  And don’t worry.  If you happened to have your mug clipped onto your pants at another fair and you spotted us, it’s only another five dollars and you get all the refills you want for that day also! 
	“Someone must have stolen one when we got swarmed before.  Just pulled it right off the wall.  Look, a peg is missing right here.  Yep.  It was probably some bratty teenagers.  That’s why I hate kids so much, they’re so damn inconsiderate.”  She sniffed and shook her head.
	“You’re probably right,” I said as I spit a hangnail.
Rose had an intense hatred for kids to the point where I felt the desire to protect stranger’s children from her at times.  If she wasn’t yelling soda prices from her shady perch, she was telling me about the boyfriend I believed might not be real or about how much she abhorred children.
	She swooped into the back of the stand, rummaged through one of the boxes for a larger fifteen dollar mug, grabbed a peg and rubber band and looked up at me.  She held the items toward me in her chubby hand.  “Want to put this back up outside?”  I grabbed them from her and watched her once again slither into the shady register spot.  I stuck the peg in the wooden wall and tied a mug onto it with a rubber band alongside the other eight or nine dust covered mugs that were strictly for show.
I would bide my time for choosing a fight because as of now there were still carnivals that Wild Bill’s had a spot at.  Working with Rose wouldn’t be completely unlikely.  My bosses didn’t trust me with the money, which is how I realized working with Heather and Rose was never just a fluke.  They had proven themselves, while I got my nose pierced and became too trashy for carnivals.
	As Rose rested her smug chubby torso on the countertop, I hoped that she would get splinters up and down her arms.  She smiled from her position of power and started yelling her usual mantra.  “What ya do is, ya buy the mug and ya get free refills.  Unlimited refills all day!”  Her nasally voice and strange upstate accent made me want to hide in the petting zoo with the giraffes and depressed kangaroos.  Any person who walked by and showed the slightest interest or confusion in the stand got harassed by her while I stood there uninterested.  Sometimes I offered apologetic looks that I hoped came off as, “She’s never done this before, I’m so sorry.”  
In the beginning of the day I would try to work but when it became obvious that Rose had no intention of letting me talk to people, I gave up and settled into a submissive stance.  I loitered off to the side where all I could do was occasionally point and answer questions until Rose stole that job from me too.
	During the times when she wasn’t assaulting customers with the same line or resting her upper body on fat little arms in the spot I deserved to relax in too, Rosellen would text.  She texted like it was her job to do so and would then reprimand anyone else for doing the same.  This was another reason why she was a manager - because she knew how to yell at people in a multitude of ways.  A talent, really.  
I worked with Heather, the most educated Wild Bill’s employee, a little less frequently which was the only benefit from this job.  She was probably the most annoying person you could spend a twelve hour shift working with.  For whatever reason, she had an endless knowledge about the soda stand and never ending criticism about what to do to help the stand get more business.  While working with Heather, it wasn’t uncommon to hear her spewing information about the formation of the soda stand in Pennsylvania or explaining the exact mixture of the soda ingredients, which was made with REAL SUGAR instead of high fructose corn syrup.  
	I leaned against the outside of the stand and watched the magic show.  The wind picked up and threw the scent of dirty animal and fried dessert into my face and I felt my stomach roll over.  No one was going to come get any soda right now because most people were watching the act for their first and only time.  I envied them.  I flipped out my phone and sent a quick text to Jackie and Kerri complaining about Rose stealing my spot, waiting for an update on how life with Heather was treating them and Steve’s whereabouts.  I had to plan my moments of professionalism, even though I always seemed to get dirty looks when my bosses were around anyway.  
	“You know, you really shouldn’t text.  At least not while you stand outside the stand.  It looks so unprofessional and makes you seem very unapproachable.”
	I turned around and stared at her, noticing the cell phone vibrating on the counter next to her arm.  I heard the vibration course through the feeble wood stand and watched as she sent a quick response, probably to the loving boyfriend stuck upstate and missing her terribly.  I never was very good with confrontation so I shifted my weight and turned my attention back to the magic show.  The parrot was about to come out anyway.
	Today was one of the days when Steve and Camille decided to show up and ask us unnecessary inventory questions and unload extra merchandise (as if we would run out) as an excuse to make sure I wasn’t stealing their money.  Sometimes they stayed and worked with us.  Luckily today I didn’t have to bear the awkwardness of watching Steve trot around the front of the stand like an overly territorial bear preying on innocent carnival goers, or listen to his hair fall out as he calculated his losses behind me.    
	Camille came over to Rose eyeing the register and me standing in front of the stand.  Even under her sunglasses I saw her stare at me, her eyes lingering on my recently pierced nose.  The first day after I had gotten it pierced, Steve noticed it.
“Oh, did you just get your nose pierced?”
“Yeah, just yesterday!  It hurt a lot, but I think I’m really happy I got it.”  I remember smiling.  So damn naïve.
Then came silence and the realization that his noticing wasn’t a compliment.
I came around to the back and started to clean up the small space so it looked like I was at least doing something.  She walked past me and I caught the smell of sunscreen emphasizing her fear of skin cancer.
	“Have you guys sold a lot of mugs today?  Boy, it’s hot.  I hope you have some sunscreen on, Nicole.  The sun’s strong today.”
	“Yeah, it’s pretty hot out.  We didn’t sell too many mugs today.  There haven’t been that many people here, they probably all came last weekend.”  Or the weekend before that.  Or even the weekend before that.  
	She nodded.  “Yeah, but when they come back they’ll want more soda and they’ll only have to pay half the price to get the unlimited refills for this weekend.  It’s such a good deal!  Are you reminding people that they can bring their mugs back next weekend for more refills?  You’re stamping people’s hands, right?”
	I nodded.  It was useless trying to explain how badly this was going to end for them seeing as they invested way too much money and time in this business already.
	“Okay guys, I have to go drop Nicholas off at soccer practice.  I’ll see you later and I’ll text you Monday with your hours for the weekend.” 
	When Camille said she was going to text us with our hours on Monday, we usually got the text Thursday around six or seven at night telling us to work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from noon to one a.m.  It was great when I tried to make plans with anyone or spend some time with my family.  I truly admired Camille and Steve’s incredible organization when running a business together.  
	Camille walked away gripping her Coach bag closer to her arm and pulling a Razor phone out to text someone.  She wore jeans that hugged her hips and her shirt rode up slightly in the back exposing her lower back.  Her straightened and highlighted hair swung below her shoulder blades and I tried to imagine how she looked when she was actually in her 20’s.
	“Nicole, could you help me with these boxes?” I heard Steve ask from behind me.  I thought he left already, but instead he was sneaking around the back of the tent making sure we had set it up correctly.
	“Sure,” I said forcing some enthusiasm into my voice.  I couldn’t act worthless in front of my boss.
	I followed him to his van parked behind the other stand and waved quickly to Jackie and Kerri.  They looked equally as bored as I felt and perked up upon seeing Steve, making moves to look productive.  He unlocked the van and returned an empty box to take out another huge box holding close to one hundred more mugs inside.  I knew we weren’t going to sell them because we still had a full crate underneath our tent, but I wouldn’t bother saying anything.  I was the deviant with the nose ring, not to be trusted.
	I tried to help carry the heavy, large boxes to the best of my ability.  But being five feet tall and a little less than 120 pounds with virtually no upper body strength to brag of, I was at a bit of a disadvantage.  I dragged it out of the van and left it on the ground, looking for lighter things to carry and leaving the big boxes to the man of the stand.
	After a few more minutes of unnecessary bustling, rearranging, and triple counting the money in the register, Steve finally decided to leave.  I looked at my cell phone quickly, afraid of getting yelled at for texting, and checked the time.  10:30 p.m. on a Sunday.  My weekend was almost over and I couldn’t be happier.
	Standing at the front of the stand again as the crowd started to dwindle after the last magic show, I saw some of the regular soda fanatics and carney creeps making their way to our stand.  All the people who needed their last mug-full of free soda formed a sugar starved mob in front of the handles while I tried not to get suffocated in the insanity.  From a safe distance on the side, I made sure nobody stole any of the mugs or pegs or t-shirts on our wall while Rosellen maintained a crazed smile from the register.  I heard a nasally hiss in my ear and recognized it as the sound of the dirty pig tent man.
	“Just here fer my free sodar,” he said wobbling toward the handle, his five teeth smiling up at me.  He was covered in dirt from keeping control of the World’s Largest Pig and World’s Smallest Ponies attractions.  This man always approached me when I was alone to tell me how much he appreciated getting free soda since he was an employee of the fair.  I never knew how to take his presence aside from holding my breath while smiling and nodding.
	“Gotta start gettin’ the ponies ready ta go.”  He told me this because he knew I found the ponies to be adorable.  “Hrm, whatta drank tonight?”
“How about cream?”
“Thas a good choice.  Cream it is!”
He filled his mug up and started to cut back behind my tent towards his own, occasionally peeking over his shoulder at me to wave goodbye or show off his rotten tooth collection.  I thought about the ponies and smiled.
This encounter would have made me feel uncomfortable and probably want to go home if a week prior to this I hadn’t already had the most uncomfortable encounter with another carney.  It was during a rainy Saturday and there were no fair-goers on this sad day.  We all sat there enclosed in our semi-dry tents and trailers, bored and waiting for the fair to be canceled so we could enjoy our early day off.
“Do you want to ride the Pirate Ship?”  A thin, greasy man slinked over and asked, smiling.  “Figure we gotta close up soon and you look bored.”  I happened to love amusement park rides and was very interested in this offer.  I quickly agreed before seeing what my Wild Bill’s coworker at the time wanted to do.  They did not want to ride the Pirate Ship.  I was going alone.
The smooth benches were damp from the rain which had stopped intentionally for this moment of embarrassment.  I sat on their cool surface and discomfort coursed through my blood as the ride started.  I smiled and pretended to have a good time while the man operating the machine watched me in amusement, a grin stuck to his face for the length of the ride.  
The plastic pirate ship rocked back and forth, the gears clinking.  I clung to the metal pole that kept me from sliding out and forced out laughter occasionally.  The ride operator’s eyes hadn’t left me the entire length of my ride and my shoulders had taken up a rigid pose of unease in response.  
The ship started to slow down and came to its rocky finish.  The metal pole released me and I walked down the path toward him, knowing that I had to say something now.
“Thanks so much!  That was really fun,” I forced out my lie.  I couldn’t exactly say the truth.  Thanks for letting me ride the wet pirate ship ride.  And thanks for watching me the entire time.  You’re lucky I feel rude saying no to people.  
“No problem!  You want to ride it again?”
“Oh, well, wow that’s so nice!  Maybe later though.  I have to go back to the stand.”  I was already halfway down the steps and ready to sprint away.  “Thanks though!”
	“All right, see you later.  I’ll probably stop by for some soda!”  He laughed and I power walked away. 
	I heard the whine of the ponies as they were tied to ropes and led out of the tent and realized that it was probably time to shut down our stand as well.  My cell phone confirmed that it was 12:30 in the morning.  Rose had already taken down the pegs and mugs on the front of the stand and was pulling down the t-shirt rack.  I grabbed paper towels and a generic cleaning solvent and started to scrub up the dry sugar underneath the soda handles.  The stand folded in on itself through us probing around with long metal poles, and eventually we had it locked up.  It was a little after one a.m. by now and I could drive home with Jackie and Kerri finally.  Another $156 made.
	Two days later I received a phone call from Camille.  I was surprised because it was early in the week and she usually waited as long as possible to give us our schedules.
	“Nicole, we aren’t going to be in need of your services anymore at the stand.  We have such a small business and we just need to have employees that we feel like we can trust with our money and at our register.  You never seem enthusiastic about your job, and Steve said you’re always complaining about having to close down the stand.”
	“Are you kidding me?”
	“I’m afraid not.”  Her tone changed from sympathy to sudden impatience.  “Also, did you draw a flower on the stand in pen?”
“What are you talking – No?  A flower?  I’m sorry, but are you serious Camille?”
“You can pick up your last check sometime later this week.”
	The phone call ended and just like that I had been fired from my first job ever.  My summer as a well-paid carney was cut short because my bosses didn’t trust me with their money and thought I drew a flower on their crappy wooden soda stand.  I was shocked.  
	I sent her a text asking if there was any way I could keep my job for the next two weeks before I went back to school.  Hours later she let me know that she talked to Steve, and no, there was no place for me there.  I typed out a quick “Your loss” and never once regretted carving that damn flower into the wood.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_lb5fp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/lb5fp/sample_writing_for_creative_writing_grad_school/,

It often may even be better if that person had just let the thing go instead of making false accusation. For me I was accused of stealing twenty dollars from a girl in my class in the seventh grade. Ashley was somebody I was pretty good friends but could no longer even talk to all because of twenty dollars that she lost and decided to blame me for stealing. Being falsely accused of something based only off a reputation can be an easy way to end a relationship. 
During the seventh grade there was a girl named Ashley. Ashley was a girl in my class who I was pretty good friends with. We had a few classes together that we would often talk in. However one day in one of the classes she realized she was missing twenty dollars that she had had that morning. When I first saw her she just looked confused, she started checking all of her pockets and then her backpack.
Then I can remember her looking at me and saying “You stole my money.”
At first I had no idea what she was talking about, and I said, “What do you mean?” 
“I had twenty dollars in my backpack and you stole it, give me my money back” she said, this time louder than before, clueing the teacher in on what we were talking about.
 The teacher then walked over to us and asked why we were being so loud, immediately Ashley responded in an annoyed tone saying, “He took my money from me.”
 Then the teacher looked at me and I said “I have no idea what Ashley is talking about.” I then reached my hands in my pockets pulling out nothing to show her my pockets were empty and that I didn’t have her money. However the teacher insisted that I was lying and that I returned Ashley’s money. Getting even more annoyed than I already was after being accused of stealing, having the teacher not believe me was even more frustrating. I continued trying to convince the teacher that I didn’t have it and still she refused to believe me. 
Over the next few minutes the tone of the conversation began get more and more aggressive then finally the teacher said, “Either you are going to give Ashley her money back or you are going to have to speak with the principle about stealing”. 
Again insisting that I didn’t have the twenty dollars the teacher sent me to the office. This being my first ever trip to the office I was scared. I didn’t know what to expect and even though I thought the reasoning was nonsense I had no idea how my principle would react. When I got to the office I had to sit there and wait because the principle was busy with a visitor. I had to have sat in the office for at least 45 minutes thinking of how ridiculous the entire situation was before the vice principle came in.
The Vice Principle asked “Why are you here.” 
I told him “My teacher sent me here because she thought I stole from a girl in my class.”
Then the vice principle brought me into his office. Before I could even tell him my side of the story he said “Stealing is a really serious thing and the best way you could fix this is to just give Ashley her money back.”
“I have no idea what happened to her money, I would never steal from anyone” I said. 
“I don’t think a teacher would send you to the office is she wasn’t sure you had the money and the only way I can let you go back to class is if you empty your pockets and let me search your backpack” said my vice principle.
 I emptied my pockets and handed over my bag, for whatever reason he seemed really sure that I had taken he money and went on to search the bag at least three full times before returning it and letting me go back to class.
When I got back to class Ashley had her hand out assuming I was coming to give her the twenty dollars she lost but instead I told her “I don’t have your money and the vice principle already searched my bag.”
 Again with the annoyed look on her face I could tell she still did not believe me. The teacher told her to sit down and that this had already disrupted enough of the class. 
Being falsely accused of something based only off a reputation can be an easy way to end relationships, it shows what that person really thinks of someone and what they are willing to accuse them of.  Like in Regina Ochoa’s “Busted for No Good Reason,” in my situation with Ashley bad judgment created much more hassle than needed to be. The entire incident could have been avoided if she took some time and actually thought out what happened to her money before accusing me.

I'm looking forward to working with the faculty of UWM.  I believe the skills that I will learn and any advice offered will be valuable in the preparation for graduate school.  My undergraduate education is the first step towards earning a degree that will lead to a future career in academia.  As a sophomore, early involvement with the Office of Undergraduate Research will better my chances of success and widen my experience to the many fields of study available at our university.

Skills:

I also possess a passion for proper communication which includes grammatically correct language, direct and detailed instruction, and an ability to stay on point.  Diligence is my best characteristic that I use to overcome any obstacle at work, in school, and at home.

A branch snapped as he continued towards the sound of the swords and shields as they clashed together like some disturbed orchestra. His leather armor blended in with the lush forest around him, that enabled him to move almost unseen and unheard until his arrows pierced into his target. As he moved towards the battle he took in his surroundings and found a good place to watch the battle unfold. He wasn’t a saint but he wasn’t a devil either. He just did what he felt was right; even if that meant that he killed someone who deserved it. The sight that his eyes feasted on was one of sheer hopelessness. A wooden caravan stood in the center of a clearing as it was attacked from all sides. The archers that guarded the caravan were decent marksmen but even the best and brightest could not fend off what seemed like a never ending horde of bandits. As the archers shot arrow after arrow into the horde, the warriors brandished short swords and kite shields as they deflected blow after blow looking for a hole in the hordes offense so they could start hitting back. Each strike from the bandits came down on the shields like a torrential rain. A bandit would swing his sword towards a defender. A shield came forward. The swing thudded into shields. Arrows thumped into shields. Swords clashed. Men cried. Blood flowed free. The hunter continued to watch and wait. Arrows continued to hit shields. Plenty of arrows hit their targets. The bandits who were under attack received a new blood lust. Their swords swung harder. The guards refuse to back down. Swords swung towards the horde. Shields came back up. Men cried out as new holes opened up. An owl came down and swooped over the battle. A bandit looked up. Men jumped forward. Swords swung. Bandits fell forward as death overtook him.


As the battle raged on before him, the hunter took out his bow and strung it. A maple composite bow was held in his hand as he pulled an arrow out of the quiver on his back. The arrows themselves were made from oak. He continued to scan the scene to see which side would be more profitable for him to help. The horde of bandits did not seem like the type that would reward him well for helping them, so he placed an arrow against the string and pulled back until the end of the arrow was level and in line with his eye. The arrow head was shaped like a metal pyramid frame mounted on the tip of the arrow, allowing for more speed as the arrow flew through the air. 
	

Waiting for the right moment to strike he sat waiting until he saw the leader of the bandit horde come into view. The leader was wearing black leather armor emblazoned with a blood red skull, the bandit’s crest. His helmet was very eccentric to say the least. It appeared as if he had cut the antlers off of a moose and mounted them on his helmet. The hunter having now sighted his target, and with the arrow aimed slightly ahead of the leader he let the arrow fly out of his hand. It flew straight towards his target as the sun glinted off the arrowhead. It whizzed past trees and bandit alike. A few moments later the arrow struck the bandit leader in the chest and went half way through him before it stopped. As the leader fell to the ground the rest of the horde now realizing they were under attack from two sides started attacking with the fervor of an out numbered army, much like how the caravan soldiers were fighting just moments before. 



The hunter quickly moved through the forest as he took shot after shot. Each shot screamed towards their target.  “The caravan reinforcements have arrived,” someone in the horde yelled. The hunter continued taking shot after shot along with the archers in the caravan’s guard, each shot meant one less bandit attacking the warriors. The warriors were fighting harder than ever trying to block the onslaught of a now desperate enemy. Swords continued to swing. Swords met shields. Men met men. The dance of death. A man stepped. The enemy stepped back. The enemy stepped forward. The man stepped back.  Slowly the numbers of the horde dwindled and the hunter started moving from the trees towards the caravan. 
	

He shot the last few members of the horde as he came upon the caravan. The guards stepped forward pulling what seemed to be a chest between them. “This is our gift to you, we found this along our travels and we have been unable to open it. If you an open it then you can help yourself to whatever is inside.”
	

The hunter stepped forward and kneeled in front of the chest noticing a padlock on the front. He reached into his bag and pulled out a set of picks and within no time at all he popped the chest open. The glint of gold graced his eyes as he noticed a stack of arrows that was about as wide as the chest itself. On top of the stack of arrows stood a short bow that appeared to be carved of the most majestic trees he had ever seen. He pulled the bow and arrows out of the chest and gave the gold to the caravan, because he had no real need for a pile of gold. It would only weigh him down. The hunter did a quick once over of the state of the defenses and handed his bow off to the one of the guards. Taking the new bow in his hand he strung it and notched an arrow and aimed at a tree across the clearing. He pulled back an arrow until the feathers brushed against his eye and let go. They all watched the arrow shoot towards the tree and listened as it thudded into the tree. The group bade farewell to the hunter and he again disappeared into the trees. A ghost once more amongst his environment.

My motivation to serve with the Student Conservation Association stems from a personal passion growing over several years. This application is a step in my career that I have come to by recent years of work experience and exploring personal interests. I began applying to Peace Corps shortly before I earned my degree in business administration. After a year of satisfying work in real estate management I joined Peace Corps and served in Moldova for two years. After completing Peace Corps and returning home, I have interned at Plenitud Eco-Educational Initiatives where I practiced sustainable architecture, self-maintained agriculture, and ecological design techniques in Puerto Rico. Plenitud implements principles of perma-culture and I learned more about how real sustainability can be possible. In pursuance of sustainability, I think how our resources are managed and studied must be based on principles of environmental stewardship and conservation. Our natural resources are increasingly precious in this era of unprecedented population growth, technological advancement, and consumption. I am applying to graduate schools in related areas because I think it is imperative to intelligently and effectively conserve, study, and manage the environmental resources available. Gaining skills and training from the National Parks Service would strengthen my candidacy to these graduate programs.

Part of Peace Corps service my service was to live in average, local households, where we share work, life, and culture. Like many volunteers in Moldova, I lived in an agricultural, rural town where much of my host family's food came from what they grew. There I led a youth group for extra curricular English, cultural exchange and critical thinking, and computer literacy for adults and youth. I had the opportunity to learn about about the farming culture in Moldova that has been passed down for centuries, so I helped with planting, harvesting, and everything near and in-between over the course of two years. I planted corn, beans, and squash; As these ancient crops grow symbiotically, I perceived a similar harmony among the community where neighbors helped each other for the greater good. More than ever, I sensed the connection between humans and their natural resources. This inspired me to learn more about sustainability, environmental science and stewardship.

I was admitted to the University of Missouri School of Natural Resources and have explored potential research projects with my advisor. However, before enrolling in such a program, I feel it prudent to first gain more work experience in the field; this would add value to my application and research assistantships. I would find either working an internship or corps position fulfilling, as both types of assignments have openings where I can receive various types of training of which I can take great advantage. With parks services I will employ my new skill set and receive training that would allow me to further explore related fields. Having done some research and reading more than a few position openings, I know that I would fit well within the professional culture and work at National Parks. I am a diligent worker who is excited to contribute to public land conservation efforts.

Permaculture projects such as constructing earth-bag housing was a great experience for me seeing tangible examples of sustainability. Plenitud allowed me to learn about sustainability by doing type of work found through the conservation corps. I was responsible for tasks required of many position openings for example, I hosted visitors, trained other interns and volunteers, and maintained the facility of the farm in trail maintenance; vegetation control; and equipment maintenance. The goals of my projects at Plenitud also had similar purposes as those in the NPS e.g. sustainability, conservation, and education. Both local and national student volunteers visit Plenitud's farm in Puerto Rico for educational and internship opportunities. I had the pleasure of training more experienced interns in earth-bag construction, and student volunteers in agro-forestry. I am seeking this position not only because I will like it but because I value the exchange of knowledge and my experience allows me to do work, I hold important, well.

Like most, I aspire for fulfilling and enjoyable work. And, I am grateful to have the opportunity to serve a project to which I attach personal significance. The skills and training I will receive as part of this projects will allow me to continue working in a field that enables me to serve nature, with other professionals who are joined together for that common purpose.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_1j2cwt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1j2cwt/grade_this_for_me_thx/,

                                                       Power That Corrupts Us All 

	Power plays a substantial role in the play King Lear written by William Shakespeare. The theme of power is recognized in many aspects of the play including exploitation by the characters for their utmost inheritance. The urge to retain the most power creates many destructive and corrupting effects. It destroys many relationships and provokes the mentality to do anything to claim it. The theme of power is shown through the miserable events that affect the tragic hero, along with the destruction of the royal families that lead to utter chaos in the surroundings.

The power that Lear possesses at the beginning of the play leads him to be pulled towards his hamartia. This is shown when the title of 'King' is abused by Lear.  An example would be when he asks his daughters to prove their love for him.  This act is useless because Lear proclaims that Cordelia is already his favourite as he calls her ""our joy"" (1.1.84). It shows the foolishness and insecurity in Lear because love has to be forced out of his daughters to please him. It could be said that his misery is deserved because his actions were questionable as a king.  The feeling of pathos is put upon the audience when Lear declares he is a ""poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man” (3.2.20). It is evident that Lear's hubris has gone and his mindset has changed. The real hardship occurs when Lear loses Cordelia just as he rejoices with her (5.3.305). To conclude, Lear’s ill-mannered and power-infected mind leaves him with nothing to live for.

Similarly, Gloucester gets manipulated by his corrupted son Edmond. His gullibility leaves him to think his legitimate son Edgar has betrayed him. This is why he is described as blind, because he cannot see the reality that is in front of him. However, this could have easily been prevented, identical to Lear’s situation. When Gloucester had found out about Edgar’s letter, he asked Edmund “Has he never before sounded you in this business” and was responded with “Never my lord” (1.2.69-71). Nonetheless, he continues to believe Edmund when a simple confrontation could have sufficed. Even Gloucester’s foolishness brings pathos upon the audience. Gloucester’s eye gets pulled out (3.7.71), and we feel pity because even his questionable decisions were not deserving of this act. Evidently, Edmund’s addiction to power brings his father down to his lowest point, and it eventually kills him.

It is clear that Goneril and Regan have created a mutual alliance. It is first depicted through their hand holding at the beginning of the play (2.4.194-195). As we move along, the longing for power starts to break apart the closeness of the siblings. We see the relationship breaking apart as Regan proclaims to Edmund, “I never shall endure her [Goneril]… be not familiar with her” (5.1.15-16). Ironically, the two crooked siblings lead to each other’s demise. A gentleman informs Edmund that Goneril had poisoned her own sister and killed herself as well (5.3.226-227). This reinforces the persuasive powers of corruption because the former loving sisters, kill each other for a mate who also is enriched in power.

Coincidentally, Gloucester family’s is mirrored in Lear’s family. Edmund attempts to take his father’s title and power by plotting against and betraying him. Even though Edgar is the real heir to the throne, Edmund’s bitterness towards being the bastard son brings out his anger. This gives him the mindset of being able to take over the throne. Tragedy occurs when Edgar sleighs his own brother because Edmund will do everything in his will to get rid of his father and brother.  Edmund has an anagnorisis and proclaims “What you have charged me with, that have I done, and more, much more. The time will bring it out, Tis past and so am I” (5.3.162-164). Sadly, it is too late and Edmund parishes. To close, the irrationality of Edmund and his power leads to the destruction of him and his family.

The corruption and destructive traits of power are clearly evident in Shakespeare’s King Lear. William Shakespeare emphasizes the enormous brainwashing ability of power by reinforcing it through the betrayal of Lear’s daughters, and Edmund’s betrayal towards Gloucester.  Pathetic Fallacy also played along to the feelings of Lear, as well as the chaos that came about because of his actions. The events that occurred enabled the reader to see the power which the main characters utilize and how. It also aided to making audience have a feeling of pathos towards the two tragic heroes, King Lear and Gloucester. The theme of power is one that is affective in emphasizing the development of characters, and revealing the plot in the tragedy of King Lear.

I couldn't bring myself to write about my GPA, classes, volunteer work, or academic achievements. Instead, I wanted to share a story about my childhood best friend, and how he helped me to become the person I am today.


-------

When I was three years old, my family had to take my dog Buster in to the vet for an emergency surgery. There are only two things I remember about that day. I remember crying because I was scared and didn’t understand what was happening, and I remember the veterinarian smiling and telling me everything was going to be okay. When he said that, I knew everything would be alright. I don’t think I really understood what a vet was back then, but I decided right then and there that I was going to be one when I grew up. From then on, I always wanted to go with my family to watch what the vet was doing, even if it was just for a checkup. 

As I grew older, so did Buster. He slowed down and got a little thicker around the belly. He would still chase tennis balls, go hiking, and bark every time he saw a truck he didn’t like, but the deep sigh he would heave as he lie down by my bed every night was a telling sign that he was getting older. 

When I was 14, Buster started to get sick. All at once, he stopped eating and walking, and would look at us like he knew something was wrong. Almost overnight, he got so sick that my mom knew she had to take him to get checked out. That was the first time I didn’t go with her to the vet, and the last time I saw Buster. He had cancer.

--------

Losing Buster was a difficult experience, but I feel that I have learned many valuable lessons from his life. As a child, I only thought about helping sick puppies and kittens feel better. Looking back, I had never considered the difficult decisions that both family and professional must make in certain situations. I had failed to take into account how frustrating the job could be, and how powerless we really are in the end. Instead of crumbling my resolve to become a veterinarian, though, it solidified it. From my volunteer work and internships, I have learned much more about the difficulties of the field, both for animal and for human.

By time I left home for college, I had decided to pursue not one degree, but three. The first is in veterinary science, as a technician. Understanding how and why we do what we do in the field is of major benefit, and is something you can’t learn in a traditional university. My second degree will be in Environmental and Organismal Biology with a minor in chemistry, and will cover nearly all of the prerequisites to get accepted into a school of veterinary medicine. My third and final undergraduate degree—which I am nearly finished with— will be in Psychology with a minor in anthropology. Too many medical professionals fail to care for their clients as much as they do for their work. I want to be a compassionate and caring veterinarian, and feel that it is extremely important for a professional to understand how and why their clients feel and act as they too.

Though it sounds like a long and difficult journey, I am almost there. Three years from now, I hope to be getting acceptance letters from some of the best veterinary schools in the nation. Ten years from now, I want to be back in my hometown of Ivins, starting the city’s first mixed animal veterinary practice, as well as a family of my own. I want to help animals to grow up to be happy and healthy. I want to mend their broken bones and fix illnesses and injuries. I want to ease their pain when they grow old, and help them to pass when it is no longer possible to go on. Most importantly, I want to give back to the animals, people, and town that helped me to become who I am today.

Forget the Past

There comes a time in everyones life when they want to go back in time and start over. In the novel, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, he tells the story of how two lovers, Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, try to recreate a relationship that they had long ago. Fitzgerald emphasizes the impracticability of recreating the past shown in his descriptive word choice, his clever use of shadows, and his thoughtful connection of boats to Gatsby’s life in order to convey a sense of illusion.

A large part of the story is told in the conversations that the characters have with each other. Fitzgerald uses words in every conversation that help make the situation clearer and show how each character feels. It is clear that Gatsby is trying to reawaken a fantasy that he has with Daisy because of the way he speaks whenever he talks about it. Gatsby is a calm and collective man but he changes when he talks about his love with Daisy. When Nick tries to tell Gatsby that he can’t repeat the past Gatsby replies, “""Can’t repeat the past?"" he cried incredulously. ""Why of course you can!"" Fitzgerald uses the word “incredulously” to describe the sheer absurdity that Gatsby feels when Nick says he can’t recreate the past. This shows that Gatsby is blinded by the illusion that he and Daisy will be together again. To Nick, recreating the past is an extremely improbable thing to do but to Gatsby it seems perfectly logical and he just needs to give it some time and put effort in it. Unlike Gatsby, Daisy is more like Nick meaning she wants to recreate the past but she accepts the fact that it is illogical to try and recreate something from five years ago. Gatsby overwhelms Daisy with his talk of creating   a new life together which pushes Daisy to say, “""Oh, you want too much!"" she cried to Gatsby. ""I love you now – isn't that enough? I can't help what's past."" She began to sob helplessly.” Important words that Fitzgerald uses are “cried”, “sob”, and “helplessly”. These words show that Daisy has broken out of the illusion and she feels sad that Gatsby still insists on being with her. Daisy says that she can’t do anything to change the past because what’s done is done and nothing can alter it. Fitzgerald’s word choices and dialogue show where Daisy and Gatsby stand on recreating the past.

Fitzgerald implements shadows throughout the book to portray the impossibility of obtaining the past. A shadow is an illusion that Gatsby is constantly trying to get a hold of. When Nick tells Gatsby he should not be trying to get Daisy back, “He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.” Gatsby thinks that the shadows are concealing his past with Daisy and that is the reason why it is so difficult to be with Daisy again. The shadow represents the past of Gatsby and Daisy, it’s there and is visible but it is forever out of their reach since they can’t reach out and grab it. Shadows are just an illusion of their past and Gatsby wants to stay in the illusion. Gatsby behaves differently went he and Daisy meet up, immediately, “Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy and [Nick] talked conscientiously from one to the other”. Gatsby is only interested in living in the past which is why he goes toward the shadow. Gatsby is unsure of how he is going to rewrite the past but does not want to think that it will not be possible which is why he hides himself in the shadows. The shadows represent a happy place for Gatsby to hide in whenever his plan of recreating the past is in jeopardy.

The metaphor that Fitzgerald uses at the end of the novel, “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past,” is used to show that Gatsby is living in an illusion. He constantly tries to recreate his past with Daisy but he never succeeds. Attempt after attempt, Gatsby is just a boat going against the current. There is no use for Gatsby to go against the flow of things because it will always push back harder and set him right back to square one or farther behind. His advancements toward Daisy only brought himself further away from his goal of actually being with her because they got people involved and made Daisy become less comfortable with the situation. Time only moves forward and it is best to just go with the flow.
The possibility of recreating the past is just an illusion that people get stuck in.

Fitzgerald’s novel, The Great Gatsby, depicts the troubles that come from holding onto the past. His word choice clearly represents whether each character is nervous or determined about recreating the past. His unique representation of shadows as the shadows of the past shows how Gatsby is stuck in an illusion and only longs to recreate the past. The metaphor of boats beating against the current displays how people must learn to go on with their lives and not let the past hold them down, a fact everyone should learn to embrace.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_19w1l2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/19w1l2/the_great_gatsby_essay_due_march_8th_not_looking/,

We were given a paragraph for state testing prep and I am wondering how my wording is and if there are any blaring mistakes or something.
Here were the guidelines:
Choose a specific literary element or literary technique used in one of the poems. Using specific details from either ""I Heard A Fly Buzz-- when I died"" or ""I felt a funeral, in my Brain"", in a well-developed paragraph, show how the author uses that element or technique to develop the passage.

Here is what I wrote:
The use of First Person point of view in Emily Dickinson's poem ""I felt a Funeral, in my Brain"" helps it develope itself. One way is how the point of view affects the tone. If the perspective had been from one of the mourners it might be a sad poem, instead, however, it is from the dead's perspective which adds an eeriness to the poem. One detail that helps develope the tone is when the narrator is describing the coffin being moved; ""And then I heard them lift a Box And creak across my Soul"". By describing the sounds we might get the feeling of being trapped in a box, isolated. This also describes how being from the perspective of the dead we obtain details differently. Another detail that describes how information is obtained occurs in Line 14 ""And being, but an Ear"". This helps us understand how information is taken in because Ears can only hear. This adds a feeling of lonliness that is magnified by line 16 ""Wrecked, Solitary, here"". The use of First Person Perspective helps develope how we get details and adds the feelings of isolation and eeriness to the tone of the poem.

We will spend several weeks in different towns in Baja and once done with that we will drive up out of Baja and through Mexico all the way down to El Salvador. After staying in El Salvador we will head to Costa Rica and stay there for a couple of weeks. Once all of this is done if we have enough money we will go see Brazil or Chile. If not we will go home.

Dear Reader,

Before you continue, I greatly appreciate the time you invest to considering my nomination. Thank you.

I have had a fairly average, yet fortunate life. Growing up I was given everything I ever needed and wanted. If I asked for something, I received it. The process required little effort, and because of that, it made me soft physically and mentally. It wasn't that I was unintelligent, it was that I lacked the discipline and determination to strive for greatness. I didn't push myself in school because it wasn't required. School had always been easy, and I kept progressing with everyone else. I was “happy” because I was satisfied with going through the motions and getting to the next level. Only until a couple years ago did I come to the realization that I have virtually wasted 17 years of my life because I hadn't pushed myself further. I hated myself for it.

The lessons of life only earned through experience had been slow to communicate, but when I finally got the message, I was lost. I was born with a great head on my shoulders, but an easy life lacking sufficient pressure has given me a lack of structure and direction. “What do I do now?” Had been my motto for the last year. As I worked and went to school I couldn't find any solutions and I felt like I was wasting even more time. Every day that went by I felt as if I was slipping further and further into a lifestyle that would render me a nobody; A person that might not be better or for worse, but simply exist. Out of every possible outcome for my life's impact, this troubled me the most. I did not want to continue standing aimlessly as the world passed me by, only to grow old and look back at my life with regret. I wish to harbor great pride from my life's accomplishments. I want to actually make a difference for the better and contribute the most as possible to the United States and to this planet's welfare. 

The one true goal that I have made in my life has been very influential in recent months. I want to squeeze every last drop of hard earned potential out of my being and live with dignity and honor. I want be formed into a true leader. I want to become a person who inspires others not by persuasion, but from action and accomplishments. I want to strive for new goals and live life to the fullest. I want to become a part of something that is greater than myself and contribute to the world. It is my utmost belief that the United Stated Naval Academy will grant the opportunity for me to push myself to my limits and beyond; ultimately becoming my greatest self. 

I intend to join the United States Naval Academy because the goals that I hope to accomplish cannot be attained from a civilian lifestyle or a civilian career. I want to become a U.S Navy SEAL. It is by far my most ambitious goal. However, it is one of my strongest convictions that I will succeed. In order to be my best and do my best, I believe that a future in the USNA is the absolute best option for attaining my goals.
 
Sincerely,
BattleTitts

I'm writing about Margaret of Anjou's role in the play, and the set up for my thesis is kind of a bear. I think my assertions are a bit layered and complex, and though I've rewritten and revised this introduction paragraph what feels like a thousand times, I'm still concerned that it's just too disorganized and confused. Any feedback on the structure of my argument(s) would be greatly appreciated.

I initially didn't explore the ways Margaret proves herself a foil for Richard in my introduction because I thought it was obvious, but when I pitched my thesis to my professor he informed me that this wasn't a commonly held opinion in Shakespeare scholarship, and that I would have to establish not only how Margaret's critiques of Richard are different from other characters' but also how she is a mirror for him. This made my opening that much more convoluted.

I just want my introduction to make the assertions that Margaret is a crone (after defining that a crone is) in the literary tradition because she has some mysticism, has wisdom, and serves as a critic for the ""hero."" She shows she has mysticism by breaking the 4th wall, casting curses, and making prophecies. She shows her wisdom by ""seeing through"" Richard and thus proves herself his foil. Margaret is demonstrated to be a foil for Richard by their similar but opposed powers and strategies: breaking the fourth wall, making realized prophecies vs. making false prophecies, and wishing death on those considered deserved vs enacting death on those considered innocent. In all of these ways, Margaret, as a crone, is able to critique what Richard stands for, blood-feuding, and her theatrical power to critique is demonstrated through her three mystical powers. My paper then continues after the introduction to be organized into three body paragraphs separated by the three types of Margaret's mystical powers and how they draw negative attention to blood feuding.

Thanks for doing this guys!,Hunterkiller00,5,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/13oue6/generic_uc_personal_statement_proofread_request_4/,"Describe the world you come from — for example, your family, community or school — and tell us how your world has shaped your dreams and aspirations.

It’s hard to imagine that one small act, seemingly thoughtless, just a kind gesture, can change someone’s life. This is exactly what happened to me on a birthday when, out of a gift from my great aunt, my world changed forever. The gift wasn’t that big of a deal, a Science textbook written for kids, something my aunt probably found browsing her local bookstore. I wasn’t really even that excited for it, I had never heard of it before, why couldn’t I get a video game that I was probably more concerned with. But that book, once I began to read it, I can’t even begin to describe the profound effect it had on me. This book opened up a whole side of the world to me; I loved reading, from fiction, to giant trivia books gifted to me by my parents. Books like this one drifted to other book, including one on History by the same author. Other books, and even some video games led to me the unveiling of whole other subjects, which have helped expand my education.

In school, I was never athletically gifted. I still was in sports, but I wasn’t very good at them. I had all the free time in the world, I could finish homework in a short amount of time, and then I would immediately go back to these books and games that sparked interest in me. For example, back in Elementary and Middle School, I knew more about World War 2 than my history teachers due to my own researching of the subjects. In Eighth Grade, I was christened the nickname “google” for being able to answer every question in my Honors History Class. School was never hard for me, I only had to put a minimal amount of work into it, able to do whatever I wanted. Sadly for my school career, when it got time to put more work into school I was so used to the bare minimum I became overwhelmed, and my grades suffered as a result. I have learned the errors of my ways, trying to have too full of a schedule, with doing Marching band up to 20 hours a week, and other extracurricular activities clogging all of my team, and having a conceited notion that High School AP students should sleep. Yet, even with getting caught up in other activities and school, I always loved these books and did my best to continue my love of reading. Even when I didn’t have the time, the fact that they had a huge impact on my life is relevant. 

Even now, these interests have an impact. Throughout High School, History has always been my best and favorite subject. I’m currently writing an Extended Essay for the International Baccalaureate program on the effects the Seleucid Empire had on the rise of Roman expansion in Hellenic territory, a topic that most people probably have never even heard of, which caught my interest through my own research. I hope to major in either Economics or Political Science in College, and to pursue a career in one of those fields. All of this thanks to a little boy and a book his great aunt picked out.



Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud and how does it relate to the person you are?

What I consider one of my greatest accomplishments comes from a common source, the Boy Scouts of America. However, my achievement did not come from receiving my Eagle Scout rank, or getting a merit badge, but it came from my actions, and the confirmation that I was leading the kids correctly in such a manner that they respected me while learning. 
These words stemmed from the second half of my sophomore year in high school, when I wasn’t dedicated, or even all that in interested in Boy Scouts. As what most kids going through the program wanted, I was just looking to get my Eagle rank, and then get out. But then, in a sudden turn of events, I was offered by my Scoutmaster to come and help with the training of some of the younger boys who were just getting started scouting. Not entirely sure what to expect, but hoping to earn some respect among the adults and some leeway in the troop for later, I accepted. Over the course of that weekend, I taught them the basic scouting curriculum, how to pitch a tent, raising and lowering flags, how to clean and maintain a uniform, et cetera. However, I tried to take it a step further. When it came to do flags the second evening of the campout, I witnessed them being distracted during the ceremony, and disrespectful to the flag. As a response, I pulled them all to the side and made them practice their salute for about 10 minutes, and then had them hold up their arms in the salute for even longer, much to the amusement of the parents. 

During those couple of days, as would be expected in any story with a moral, I learned something too, about how sometimes, whether we like it or not, we all have an influence on those surrounding us. I remembered that weekend how, when I was in their shoes, how much I looked up to the older boys volunteering to help my peers and I, how mature they must have been. Then I realized that for them, that was now me, and I now had that responsibility, whether I liked it or not. This realization has had an impact on me, and I now try to live my life as if I were being looked up to at all times, as we often are. It wasn’t just this experience, but this specific example showed me how, we are all in other’s shoes at one point, so to show them respect that is deserved of them is incredibly important. And now, when I see Boy Scouts picking on others because of their lack of knowledge or experience, I always get them to stop.  

Feedback appreciated!

        To better understand what O’ Connor was trying to reveal in her short story “Revelation”,
we need to better understand O’Connor’s background a bit more. By reading into O’Connor, we
learn that she was reared in the south and was a devout catholic. Many of her stories include a
religious meaning. Her readers gain some value by the end of the story. The story “Revelation”
by Flannery O’Connor’s is one with a powerful message. Revelation is a story with a meaning
that can be universal to all people. O’Connor reveals her message by intentional use of specific
characters, irony, and different settings. O’Connor uses meticulous detail with these elements to
deliver her message of self-evaluation before judgment of others. These elements surround the
protagonist to help show the symbolism of the revelation that occurs in the story.

         The use of character is important to articulate the message of the story. O’Connor uses
different characters to develop her argument in a dramatic way. The protagonist, Mrs. Turpin
is a southern white woman with money. She is confident that she is a good woman; we pick up
quickly that she is a hypocrite by how she describes herself. This woman judges all those around
her, feels and believes she is superior to all others. Mrs. Turpin relates everything to race and
social status. O’Connor uses the character of Mrs. Turpin to display the kind of prejudice and
stereotypical people of that time. She represents how O’Connor viewed the white middle class
from that era. We see that Mrs. Turpin is overbearing and strong willed by the introduction of
her husband, Claud Turpin. He listens to everything she says and it is apparent that he would not
disagree with her or her ways. The purpose of the Mr. Turpin is to show that Mrs. Turpin is not
the kind of person to be reasoned with. She does not have anyone other than God that tells her
she is right or wrong. The story introduces the antagonist, Mary Grace. Mary Grace is a “fat girl
of eighteen or nineteen” (O’Connor 393) who is sitting in the doctor’s waiting room reading a
book that also has a secret meaning to deliver. Mary Grace is also of the same class or category
that Mrs. Turpin identifies herself with. Although it seems O’Connor regarded Mary Grace as a
higher status than Mrs. Turpin. Mary Grace did not like the prejudice or the racism. Mary Grace
grows angrier as Mrs. Turpin discusses race and other classes of people as if they didn’t exist.
The white-trash characters, the well-dressed lady and the blacks that worked for the Turpins are
all symbolic of how O’Connor viewed the different types of people in that time of racism.

       Irony is used frequently by O’Connor in this short story. The name of the character,
Mary Grace has several multifaceted meanings. Knowing O’Connor’s catholic background, the
name Mary is symbolic of the Virgin Mary. In the catholic faith, Mary is the mother of Jesus, his
guidance to salvation. Mary Grace’s character is exactly that to Ruby Turpin. She is what Mrs.
Turpin needed to guide her to her revelation. The bible also states that Mary is full of Grace and
this is ironic in the story because the girl Mary Grace is described as ugly, fat, and a face full
of acne. She was characterized as being rude for not wanting to talk to Mrs. Turpin. The book
Mary Grace’s reading “Human development” is significant to the message in the story because
it is the book she hits Mrs. Turpin across the face with. The irony in this is that it’s like someone
needs to smack Mrs. Turpin with a guide book on how to be human. The hymn that is playing
on the radio in the waiting room is relevant because without fully listening or understanding the
song, Mrs. Turpin says this is her philosophy in life (398). The actual meaning of the song is
promotion of equality and togetherness of all kinds of people as a whole. It is not about one class
helping another is about all people helping each other.

           The setting is carefully chosen by O’Connor to put the revelation into perspective. The
doctor’s office is described as being small, uncomfortable, and messy. This office is quite full
with different types of people. The size and the fullness of the office represent how small the
world really is. The doctor’s office is a place of opportunity for change and unity. A place where
all types of people can communicate and also be together. The character of Mrs. Turpin took it as
an opportunity to be grateful for who she was in society and did not acknowledge the opportunity
to gather with different types of people. It is described as the exact opposite of the pig parlor,
the other setting in the story. The pig parlor has concrete floors, clean pigs, and is spacious. The
pig parlor is a place of solidarity, a place suited for those who chose not to change their wrong
ways. Mrs. Turpin is seen to have her views on life backwards. She enjoys her presence in the
pig parlor over the doctor’s office. O’Connor uses the setting to display how she views society.
There are people who accept unity and those who will not change. It is not until Mrs. Turpin
goes to the pig parlor, that she realizes she is wrong in her ways. She finally sees that she is the
only who must change.

        O’Connor delivers the message in “Revelation” by providing visual, mental, and physical
props throughout the story. There is consistent use of irony, possibly more than obviously
apparent such as the name of the girl who delivers the message that Mrs. Turpin needed to
hear or the title of the book she was reading. O’Connor uses distasteful language and extreme
violence to express her meaning in this story as well as many others she has written. The
characteristics and personalities of the characters in the story are specific to her purpose as well.
The ways the characters are depicted are O’Connor’s interpretation of people in society. All of
the elements used frequently by Flannery O’Connor help create a powerful message as well as a
dramatic impact.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_11ovls,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/11ovls/thank_you_for_your_time_in_proofreading_this/,

 After going down the self publishing route, and selling about 600 copies, I had several reviews of typos and grammar issues.

Upon inspection, I'd submitted the pre-proof copy instead of the proof'd copy. Even worse, I've somehow overwritten the proof read copy. Dropbox doesn't have the old version.

So, I am forced to re-proof it all.
I'm going through it and making as many changes as I can remember, but I was hoping to find some kind reddit folk to proof read each chapter for me.

I've broken it up into individual chapters, approx 5 pages each.

It needs to answer why do i want to do it, what do I want to get out of the program, and what will I add.

Really go at it. Thanks in advance.

BLDR is the acronym for the program.
----------

I want to join the Business Leadership program in order to further myself academically. I think that BLDR would take me a bit outside of my element. This would, of course, enable me to grow academically. By removing myself from classes that I feel pretty comfortable in, I hope to develop an entirely new skillset and sharpen my critical thinking abilities. I hope to be exposed to many intelligent people who will challenge me to excel, while also exposing me to new ideas. 

One of the most useful tools for any aspiring professional has to be the ability to speak well. At the introductory presentation, one of the major things that current students felt that they got out of the program was the ability to speak to anyone calmly and with poise. In life, I will constantly need to convince important people to choose me instead of others. Whether I am trying to get into graduate school, find a job or obtain a research grant, I will need to persuade people. If BLDR can help me to get a better handle on public speaking now, before I am being scrutinized during major event in my future professional career, then I will have gained a very powerful advantage in life.

Science and Technology are very dynamic industries. A scientifically oriented individual, such as me, will bring a very important and applicable perspective to the group. During the presentation, I noticed that there was only one biology minor in the group. Someone with a passion for science thinks differently than others. A person of science has a very rational worldview; they always attempt to delve deeper, never satisfied with unanswered questions.


----------

EDIT: Some quick background because I'm sure that my topic might have been a little confusing out of context. I'm a biology major. I want to study ecology and especially like plants. I haven't really had any interest in business, but I got a letter inviting me to come to this meeting and here I am. There were about 100 people at the meeting. They said that they'll call back about 30 for interviews, and only 15 get in. So it's probably a long shot. As I wrote, there aren't any science majors in it right now, but we'll see.

To: Faculty and Managers

The current employees of Stop and Shop Gas Station are writing the upper management in a hopeful attempt to finally move one, Joseph R. Flynn Jr. from the department. We hope to convince management that it is in their best interest to do so and, hopefully satisfy the needs of one of Stop and Shops most valuable departments.

As the management knows all too well, Mr. Flynn has increasingly become a nuisance to the department, store and more importantly the management. Mr. Flynn makes ridiculous requests on a regular basis, such as stringing multiple weeks worth of vacation together, leaving department head James Bennett in a tough spot to make up hours. Mr. Flynn also makes ridiculous accusations against members of the staff at the gas station including James. These statements include but are not confined to accusing James of playing favorites among his staff and giving Mr. Flynn shifts which he feels are unfair and made in an attempt to aggravate Mr. Flynn. He also accuses members of “stealing his customers”.

Mr. Flynn is also known to be loud and obnoxious, both inside the station booth and outside by the pumps. Often taking extended periods of time to converse with customers, sometimes loudly with bad puns, jokes and other sorts of humor. Mr. Flynn will also on the occasion, stick his head in inappropriately inside customers cars.

Flynn has earned the dubious distinction of being the only person in the stations current roster, to have earned the disdain of all other members. Mr. Flynn is a known two face and snitch, often overheard talking about other members while they are not currently present. He often makes rude comments about department head James Bennett, accusing him of making subtle actions in order for him to “take the hint”. Such as and not confined to, not hanging his certificates up in the station. Such statements are frequent and just as ridiculous as the one mentioned above. 

Mr. Flynn also likes to bring his personal life into the work place, often citing issues with his mother, father and siblings as stress causing factors. He will often make mention of them at any given time, and often use them as excuses for sympathy among the staff and, more importantly customers. 

As the final point of this petition, we the staff would like to point out that Mr. Flynn himself wants to be moved inside, as stated on numerous occasions. Mr. Flynn is dissatisfied with his job as a gas station attendee and with his co-workers. Mr. Flynn is making our work place miserable and our shifts boring and uncomfortable.

Mr. Flynn has become outcast of station employees and is not looked upon favorably by anyone. This petition is being submitted to Stop and Shop upper management in the hopes that they will listen to us and find a job that Mr. Flynn would enjoy and, satisfy the needs of the station staff as well as Mr. Flynn himself. 

The following are the names of all station members, including Mr. Flynn himself who we hope will sign it as well, in order to drive the point home.

These reviews overlap a LOT.  When I'm citing a piece of info, do I cite each source I have that mentions the info?  And these ""sources"" also cited other, older papers throughout the body.  Do I cite who they cite?  Or do I cite them? 

So I printed an article by Jones et al. That's the one I'm holding, that's the one I'm reading and it says ""This condition usually arises from blah blah blah (Smith 1979)""

Do I cite Jones or Smith?  I don't have access to Smith, I've never read Smith, so do I cited Jones?

And then, if my three independent sources each mention and cite Smith's ""this condition arises"" quote, do I cite all three of my sources, or just one, or Smith?

1/31/12 Thecklin’s return, Hawtharg sees the light, Crowther’s Mound at midnight, we swap tales, Caldera’s catacombs, the Duskmen attack

 

The date was 2nd Marthracian, Vikanoss. We were 9 days into the month, standing outside the southeastern gate when Thecklin Boulter appeared on horseback. It seemed his horse was as slow as he. He had only been gone for 3 days, but he appeared to have been gone for years. His beard was gray like an old man who had read many tomes and was wise beyond his years, but alas he was the same Thecklin that had left us just days before. And he still retained a blonde streak down the center of his beard. We welcomed him briefly and decided to meet at Arend’s to break our fast. Once all were fed, we talked quietly of thinks that mustn’t be spoken of at the ale house, and decided to meet at Crowther’s Mound at midnight for a more in-depth discussion. We parted ways to take care of the day’s business.

 

Thecklin headed for the synoptrium, and found prior Hawtharg straight away. They went to the priors room, where Thecklin was to receive prayers. During this meeting, Thecklin produced a cold iron short sword and asked the prior to detect if it was magical. As the prior sang and cast, Thecklin noticed that the prior was just a shell of a man, and his powers were not of meriaun. Thecklin recited some of the 19th book of the way of light, and the prior recognized a new power in Thecklin. Thecklin called the prior out on the fact that he was not truly of meriaun, and yet the prior remained silent.

 

Severyn and Caldera attended home business.

 

Adalwulf had a small, leather covered, lead, hinged orb crafted to hold the magical ring he had found.

 

Huw was nowhere to be found. It was sad really, because in the land of Arkasia, if you aren’t there you don’t get experience.

 

Midnight came, and four Lidori came forth from the shadows to meet at Crowther’s Mound. There Caldera told of his magical abilities, Thecklin of his time away (which I hope you’ll fill in here Jesse), Severyn of his time with Caldera in the catacombs under Caldera’s house, and Adalwulf of the genie he and Huw met.

 

We decided to find and kill the giant spider that was still lurking under Caldera’s house. We went to the catacombs and found what we thought was the spider hiding in a well. We started a fire in the well, and covered the well with two tables. Caldera went out to see if he could locate an outside entrance, and was successful. We decided to block off the well, and approach the spider from the outside entrance. However, as we were headed to the alternate opening, we heard a loud commotion coming from the center of town. We raced toward Eidrol’s and discovered several Duskmen attacking Geidrok and the other patrons of Eidrol’s boarding house. After a few were killed the others fled, but not before making off with *** and Geidrok’s ring finger. He was concerned that his wife would kill him because they took his ring.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_p6mn8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/p6mn8/something_lighter_my_wife_says_my_grammar_is_bad/,
1327457332.0,4,self.Proofreading,oveov,My analysis of George Washington's farewell address.,smayhew,4,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/oveov/my_analysis_of_george_washingtons_farewell_address/,"Assignment:

You are the curator of an American History museum. You are displaying a “Famous American Documents” exhibit which will showcase many famous documents from the early federal period of American History. Next to each document is a small placard created by the museum staff which provides patrons a brief summary.


Your task is to draft a summary of the 1796 Farewell Address of George Washington (click here for a transcript) for the placard. In no more than two single spaced pages (preferably one), you must summarize the key points of the Farewell Address. Make sure to include any places, dates, or events from our lectures that could help explain the Farewell Address. Finally, please make sure to compare or contrast the Farewell Address to Washington’s Inaugural Address which begins on page 13 of Adams, The Early American Republic. The key is to give the patron an understanding of the significance of the document as well as sense of its historical context, but to do so in a compelling and concise manner.

My Paper:
	
George Washington’s farewell address came before the election of John Adams and at a time in which the politics that would shape the future of the United States were beginning to be divided between parties.  This historic document relays the feelings that Washington had toward such division and also expressed his thoughts on the future of the country.  When compared with his Inaugural address one cannot help but notice the change in tone and knowledge that Washington has gained during his tenure as the President of the newly founded country.

One of the most important points that can be noted from Washington’s presidency is the one in which he addresses at the beginning of his farewell.  Although Washington was wanted and by some perhaps even expected to continue in his position as President he declines the proposition of running for another term.  In doing this he sets a precedent for future Presidents of not serving more than two consecutive terms in office.  Although this was not officially the limit of terms that one single person may serve until FDR, this act of stepping down must be interpreted as Washington’s respect for the Republic and his strong feelings toward avoidance of having the presidency of the United States turned into a monarchial type position.

It cannot help be noticed that Washington spends a large portion of the beginning of his farewell address issuing warnings and expressing his thoughts about the danger of having separate and defined parties in the politics of the US.  He begins this by speaking about how the geographical distinctions that separate the country should not be considered as dividing lines in the nation.  Washington then warns many times over that in order to be a single and unified government all parts and participants have to learn to cooperate with one another and to do so peacefully.  Washington at the time was considered a Federalist due to his wanting of a strong federal government that decided on most matters that affected the individual states and as there always will be when a group of people get together their were opposing points of view. The anti-Federalists believed that the common people and state governments should be able to decide on their own how to run things in their respective states and that to have such a strong type of government would be too close for comfort to the days when the US was under the jurisdiction of a Monarch.  It should be known that the party divisions were very distinct and clear shortly after the time John Adams became President in 1796.

Washington also expresses his concerns about American neutrality and maintaining positive foreign relations with all the nations that the US had ties.  At the time there were rising hostilities between the French and Great Britain and in the opinion of Washington, neutrality was the best course of action for this young country’s survival.  Although eventually the US would have no choice but to enter a war as it was being fought on her soil, Washington made his opinions most clear on how to maintain peace between the US and potential adversaries.

Lastly a main theme that can be noticed when comparing Washington’s inaugural and farewell addresses are the changes in his tone and the material that make up these speeches.  Washington begins his presidency amidst throngs of supporters and citizens that are celebrating his new position and yet Washington instead of joining in and reveling in the importance of his office takes a more somber tone and expresses to a no doubt bewildered Congress his concerns and doubts about taking this office and how he thought of it as a patriotic duty and honor not as a major victory.  When then looking at his farewell address one notices that the somber notes may still be present but instead of appearing to be a young, shy, and even intimidated young boy uneducated in the role he must play he delivers his farewell with the wisdom of an old man and reflects on the experience to draw support for his conclusions.

This piece of history before you gives such insight and speaks volumes about the young country and the man most associated with its birth.  There is so much hidden in the language and between the paragraphs that tell the story of Washington’s presidency and the history of the US though the span of years he was in office.  There can be no doubt that Washington was a true patriot who believed in this idea of a new country that governed itself and he took pride in being forever associated as a key player in its founding.  Washington also set forth a standard for those to follow for the respect and reverence that should be held for the position.  The legacy of George Washington shall forever be remembered and his name will always stir patriotic emotions in the citizens of his country.

Here are the topics:
1 Evaluate a significant experience, achievement, risk you have taken, or ethical dilemma you have faced and its impact on you. 

2 Discuss some issue of personal, local, national, or international 

3 Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence. 

4 Describe a character in fiction, a historical figure, or a creative work (as in art, music, science, etc.) that has had an influence on you, and explain that influence. 

5 A range of academic interests, personal perspectives, and life experiences adds much to the educational mix. Given your personal background, describe an experience that illustrates what you would bring to the diversity in a college community, or an encounter that demonstrated the importance of diversity to you. 

6 Topic of your choice.
Essay:
&gt; 	I remember as a little boy I used to sit on the front steps of my apartment building, watching the pigeons fly to and fro.  The Sun was always shining brightly.  The air was fresh and crisp and the wind always blew gently, almost seeming that Mother Nature was trying to accommodate the people.  As always, I let my imagination run wild, which would ultimately lead me to conjure ideas and thoughts I had about myself.  The topic of interest in every thought was “What am I going to do with my life?”  Am I going to be a cop? Am I going to be a firefighter? Or am I going to be a lawyer?  
	For the purpose of being organized, I made a list of possible career choices, which included the careers previously stated.  I scrutinized each career choice carefully and efficiently, using books and other resources that were related to the career.  To be a little surer about my top three career choices stated above, I promised myself to at least have an experience relating to each choice.
	For instance, I attained a little more knowledge about being a cop through my aunt, who was a cop.  She described to me the benefits, such as having the feeling of knowing that you are protecting millions of New Yorkers and acting as a role model for young kids.  As she was telling me this, I couldn’t help but ponder over the utility belt that she was wearing with her police uniform.  The belt contained a large, black flashlight and three empty sockets.  One socket, however, caught my eye the most.  I realized that this interesting socket was for her gun.  After this realization, I knew I couldn’t be cop.  I wouldn’t have the power to carry such an overbearing thing that can possibly kill someone, or worse, destroy a family.  As if this weren’t enough, I also realized I couldn’t be a firefighter because it required more bravery and sacrifice than a cop.  I also couldn’t be lawyer, since I didn’t even have confidence.
	Completely infuriated, I stormed back home without telling my aunt why.  I couldn’t tell someone who sacrifices her life every day that I wasn’t courageous.  As I was furiously crossing the choices out of my worn-out list, I accidentally tore a giant hole into the paper that stretched from end to end.  Through the hole, I saw something that completely amazed me, and not in a good way.  Liter was everywhere on the street.  Smashed plastic containers, candy wrappers, and tissues were scattered all over.  My heart sunk at the sight of this.  How can someone who inhabits the Earth, even calls it its own home, deliberately destroy it?
	Since this affected me greatly, I knew I had to have a career in the realm of Science.  I would have to study Environmental Science.  Simply put, I love the Earth and all its beauties.  Her diversity is what attracts me the most.

The ohara Valley which I want to introduce to you is one of the most popular summer resorts of Osaka-do, Japan because of its extremely beautiful landscape which contains strange rocks formation and cliff overpowering us, and the pellucid well. The Name of the valley means “extremely pellucid and green jade color water”. Appropriately named, the well made by water of Ohara Valley is actually jade-green. You can even find fishes swimming out through the water of the well. Actually, I had never been a water landscape until I got the Ohara Valley, and I was really excited to watch the great landscape.
	
  I guess you may wonder how I could find that gorgeous summer resort out. It was very lucky. My friend and I sought for somewhere to spend our summer vacation through internet, but everybody was recommending get to the beaches. However, we didn’t want to pick a destination naively. We have a reason to have a meaningful summer break because we are about to join the army. We, therefore, gave up seeking our destination through internet social community. Instead, we called tourist information center of Osaka-do to get a recommendation. They said that there is a suitable resort for us, and recommend the Ohara Valley site because it is not so far away from Seoul and not overcrowded. I believe that was a great choice. Anyway, we started off on a journey to the Ohara Valley with fluttering hearts.

Immediately after our arrival at the place, we jump into the water with a splash. The water seems not to be there. It was so pellucid and cold. We liked it. There is also a huge and high artificial waterfall which was also a sightly scene. You cannot miss a green and dense forest where you can enjoy a therapeutic walk. Of course, you can swim in the well. However, you should be aware of drowning because there are so many depth points in the well. Actually, I almost fell into the deep water, but managed to get out of there luckily. In addition, it is important to prepare for eating. However, you don’t have to worry about carrying with heavy foodstuffs because there is a Nong-Hyup Mart which sells everything very cheaply. Hence there is no need for carrying heavy icebox. We bought some pork meats to enjoy the middle of the night party. It was awesome, too.

Now, I guess you would have a mind considering going to the Ohara Valley for summer vacation next year. As you read, the Ohara Valley has many good points of visiting; A beautiful landscape, the pellucid water and the moderate crowd. However, I can tell you those are not all why I recommend you; ultimately, you can feel the mother-nature and heal yourself exhausted, leaving from your stuffy city life. Well, How about planning your next summer vacation with visiting the Ohara Valley?




My Ideal Wife

The most people have the own standards to choose their other half in their minds for their dream spouses, and It effects on our future marital life. We can marry our current girl or boy friend who makes you feel happy for the present even if your future marital life with her or him will be ruined because of conflicts on everything. Thus, we don’t need to be so impatient to choose our companion for long life. Now, I would discuss about some standards of choosing my ideal companion.

First of all, my ideal companion should not be the same as me, but there should be a good atmosphere of understanding between us, because she is supposed to be my entire marital life partner neither my opponent nor enemy whenever we are trying to overcome hardship. If she or he could understand you and sympathize with you in a kind of difficult situation; lay-off, illness, someone close’s passing. You would sense great relief which makes a marital life indomitable.

Second, I expect my ideal companion to be faithful, because the basic of successful marriage is faith in each other. Faith in each other makes our self-confidence boosted, and it would give us energy to get through hardship of life. Of course, both of two have mutual obligations to have faith in each other. Faith is a requisite for respect for minimum and fundamental private life. Sometime I’ve met with someone suspicious about everything. It was absolutely not a marriage, but she always phone called asking where I am. Actually, I have never, ever cheated on her. It was really choking me, and we, finally, broke up with each other.

Third, the beauty is also a requirement to be my ideal spouse. Maybe someone would think that judging by an appearance is not quite reasonable. Yes, you are totally right. However, the mankind is optically influenced easily; hence we cannot totally ignore an appearance of our nominee. However, the beauty for me is not only the outer beauty because sooner or later it will be abolished but inner beauty comes from the kindheartedness. You can easily imagine a marriage with your girlfriend with a lovely face who shows a villainous temper in every matter. Will you marry her? No, you will not. And I won’t too.

I guess women who read above until now are thinking I am so arrogant. I apologize if it sounded arrogant, but I want you to keep in your mind that the marriage is no joke, and you should devote yourself to find your fiancé and choose your spouse who will stand by you in the rest of your entire life, as I said above. Of course, I also have to match me to my spouse. If I didn’t, it doesn’t matter how my spouse meets above requirements, since she cannot stand my unsuitableness during a marital life. Remember this. The bottom line is that your choice of spouse should be with prudence. But your marriage life with the ideal spouse depends on how you do.

I am trying to get into medical school and need help with one of my essays. It is pretty short only about 300 words. It does not have any immediate due date but I would like to submit it sooner rather than later.

I tried to keep the tone a mix of both professional and personal so that whoever reads the essay sees me as a person and not just another candidate. I think it's decent but then again I was never spectacular at writing essays and what not.

====================================================

I would be lying if I did not admit that even though I have good, honorable reasons for why I want to be a doctor, the main reason is... a little selfish. I want to be a doctor because I want to make a difference with my life, I want to leave the world a little better then when I came here. I want to be a doctor because I want to touch peoples’ lives and have their lives be better because I existed.

I have seen first hand how important medicine is. I have lost family and friends and I know that one of the greatest things that doctors can do is to give patients more time; more time to enjoy life, more time to spend with their families. My late-uncle had liver cancer and by the time it was discovered he did not have much time left. Medicine made my uncle’s final days longer but more importantly doctors gave my uncle more time. That is what I want to do, give people more time.

As an EMT I have witnessed the results of horrible accidents and as a volunteer in the ED of a trauma center I have literally seen doctors save lives and bring people back. From the very first time I was allowed to participate, I was hooked. The adrenalin that rushes through your veins as you work with a team of experts each knowing exactly what to do and working perfectly in concert. I realized very early into my days as a volunteer that one days I would be an ER doctor.

Can anyone read this and offer any recommendations?,iamthatis,4,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/fh71v/i_have_to_write_a_letter_to_my_english_teacher/,"The letter is as follows. Is there any areas where you would recommend touching it up?

--------

Dear Ms. *Teacher*:
 
My name is *name*. I’d like to take this opportunity to introduce myself and allow you to see a clearer image of me as a student and an individual. I plan to do this by telling you of my strengths, weaknesses and interests as well as my expectations for the English course.

I greatly enjoy the mathematical and scientific side of academics, though I’m also keen on the arts. As such, I consider myself prominently a logical, step-wise thinker who tackles situations with a planned, regimented and often solitary approach. Because of this, I find I struggle with simply consuming information, and instead prefer to visualize concepts in examples and scenarios, such as considering off-beat or practical instances. In the long-term, this proves to be a much more fruitful strategy, as I’m able to not only understand the surface, but the concept as a whole becomes much more accessible and clear.

As a graduating student, and it is sometimes difficult to balance everything that needs my attention and the deadlines that have to be met. I'm also a part-time employee at the *where I work* as well as a member of several groups and athletic programs, so I juggle a significant work-load in addition to my school-work. Given the time of year, a great deal of attention has to also be given to scholarship applications and university preparation, securing not only the present, but the future equally.

Creative writing and reading novels rank among my favorite aspects of English. From a very young age I have taken an interest in both reading stories and writing my own. As a result I feel this has improved my ability to communicate with people and convey points, both in the spoken and written form. My goal for this course is to improve on these skills as a whole and to get as much out of this opportunity as possible.

I am hoping that my skills in English are improved across the board as I move closer toward graduation. Here’s hoping this gives you an insight into my goals and identity as a student as we commence this course. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope to hear back from you.

I'm currently in the process of submitting my application for an exchange year in Hong Kong. Here is the letter of motivation I wrote. My english is pretty bad so I would need all the help I can get from you. Thank you very much!
----------
Dear Sir or Madam:

My Name is XXXX XXXX and I’m a second year student doing a Bachelor in Software Engineering at the École Polytechnique de Montréal in Canada. I am writing to express my motivation in participating to the student exchange program at the City University of Hong Kong for a period of 1 year starting this fall 2011.

Last semester, I had the opportunity to assist to a conference from the responsible of the International program at our university, XXXX XXXX, which started with the following sentence: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish”. This sentence has been burnt in my mind ever since. The presentation went on by sharing experiences of fellow students who came back transformed from their exchange and right away, I knew that I wanted to be part of this project. 

It did not take me long to settle on the spectacular city of Hong Kong. Being open-minded, I am eager to discover new horizons. Over the years, I had the opportunity to travel to many interesting regions of the world. Unfortunately, I have not had the chance to put a foot on the Asian continent and I feel I am still missing out on what are probably the most intriguing and fascinating societies on earth.

This year in your University will give me the occasion to not only visit this mysterious nation and fill this curiosity gap that has been gnawing me for so long, but most importantly will give me this extraordinary opportunity to learn from your culture. Through all my life, my education was based on a strictly occidental point of view. My values, my morals, my mentality are highly influenced by the western perspective. And I feel unfortunate to not have been exposed to such a different culture from mine : I realize there is much more to the world than what I have been taught and I am appealing you to give me the chance to explore it.

The City University of Hong Kong satisfies everything I could ever wish from such an experience. Your prestigious university is situated in the center of what is possibly the most effervescent metro pole of the eastern world. The international fame of your university assures me a quality education and your formation oriented to the professional life is exactly what I am searching for. Studying at your faculty will undoubtedly help me extend my knowledge on some area in which your Department of Computer Science excels by its research, among others on the advancement of distributed database and on the subject of security and cryptology.

This project is an adventure of a lifetime and I am prepared to make every effort possible to substantiate it. I hope I am given the opportunity to have this challenging and enlightening period in your institution.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I am looking forward to your positive response. 

Yours sincerely, 
XXXX XXXX

1375810551.0,3,self.Proofreading,1jto56,Please help me briefly proofread this (HCE = health care expenditure),wuwu9,3,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1jto56/please_help_me_briefly_proofread_this_hce_health/,"Note: I have some  unfinished areas (so ignore that for now)

In Finland, there exists a negative relationship between HCE and GDP during the short and medium-run from 1961 to 1965. After World War II, Finland made an enormous effort to establish its health care system by building hospitals and health clinics, but found that it could not efficiently eradicate common health problems because a lack of resources available. The lack of efficiency is a possible explanation for the negative relationship. From 1970-1976, we observe a negative relationship between HCE and GDP, with HCE leading. Investment on HCE was substantial, and it was not until 1979 when the Occupational Health Care Act was established, which made employers provide mandatory health care services for employees. Thus, from 1979 on, we observe GDP leading HCE positively in 1997-2000 in the short run, 1992-1998 in the medium run, and 1984-2003 in the long run. The switch from HCE leading to GDP leading supports the bi-directional hypothesis because higher expenditure for HCE increases productivity and income, which in return goes back to expenditure on HCE. Another explanation for GDP leading HCE, with a positive correlation can be attributed to the successful national suicide prevention project Finland carried out from 1986-1996, which reduced suicide rates to 18 per 100,000 people in 2005. explanation for 2009 GDP leads HCE, neg*

We observe the feedback hypothesis in the short run, long run, and medium run for the country, Iceland. All frequency bands begin with GDP leading HCE positively before 1972, and switch to HCE leading GDP later on. Post World War II, Iceland’s economy grew rapidly, roughly about a 4% annual increase. In addition, Ireland initially had barriers to trade, but these barriers were lifted after 1960. Following the 1970’s, trade restrictions were lowered even more substantially, allowing for better allocation of resources. Two important pieces of legislation include the 1971 Social Security Act and the 1973 Health Care Act passed by Parliament altered Iceland’s health care system. The 1971 Social Security Act specified that all of Iceland should be covered by one public health insurance scheme. Passed two years later, the 1973 Health Care Act ensured that the best health care services should be available to all of Iceland. In the short run, HCE led GDP negatively from 1987-1989 due to Iceland’s period of high inflation, averaging about 38% annually. However, in the medium and long run, HCE leads GDP positively from 2003-2004 and 1998-2004, respectively. During this half-decade, there were new establishments in Iceland in regards to health care, including the Act on Alcohol and Drug Prevention in 1998, and an Act on Radiation Protection in 2003. The new reforms increase life expectancy and productivity, so it is logical to conclude that the health care spending has led to more productivity, which in turn increases GDP. 

GDP is consistently leading HCE in Norway. From the 1970’s to the 1990’s, the relationship between the two time series variables is positive. This can be attributed to the exploitation of oil and gas deposits during the 1970’s, also dubbed the “oil boom.” Norway’s earnings from exports rose during the early 1980’s due to the oil and gas deposits. This signifies a major increase in GDP, which allowed the country to spend more on health care. In the medium run, GDP occurs to lead HCE from 2006-2010, and there is a positive correlation between the two variables. The continuous wavelet analysis did not fail to capture one of Norway’s most recent programs, called the Norwegian Centers of Expertise program. The purpose of this program is to stimulate business and economic growth, so this new establishment can explain the positive relationship between HCE and GDP, with GDP leading HCE. Additionally, another big project was undertook during 2006, called the Oslo Cancer Cluster, a research cluster dedicated to finding new cancer cures and technology, so there is evidence that health care spending is being increased as GDP rises. In the short run, from 2008-2010, there is a negative correlation between HCE and GDP, with GDP leading HCE. 

Japan’s economy is widely studied for its miraculous economic recovery post World War II. Moreover, its high life expectancy rate cannot compare with the other OECD countries. In Japan, GDP leads HCE negatively from 1965-1967 in the short run and from 1967-1968 in the medium run. This could be explained by Japan’s inexpensive and universal health care system, “kaihoken,” which started in 1961. Health care expenditure is extremely low, as it is composed of only 8.5% of GDP even though it has a high population of elderly people. The relationship between HCE and GDP is significant during the medium run for Japan during 1983-1986. During the 1980’s, even though health care spending rapidly grew among many countries, Japan was able to keep costs down as it had preset the fees for health care services every two years. In 1983, all of Japan’s elderly population was covered by government-sponsored health care insurance. Japan’s health care policy is more sophisticated than the average country’s. When a patient exhausts his monthly copayment, he does not need to pay more. There is already a specific threshold for the amount of copayment per month depending on income and age. In the medium run, HCE leads GDP, with a negative correlation from 1994-1995. The impact of Japan’s bubble economy is reflected in the analysis. During the 1990’s, Japan’s economic bubble collapsed, and much of the baby-boom generation were approaching the age of 45. There were a lot of unpaid loans and problems due to the country’s shift in demographic structure. In the long run, it is HCE that leads GDP, with a positive relationship between HCE and GDP during 1994. (come back to explain later…) GDP leads HCE, with a positive relationship between the two variables in the long run in the years 1995-1996 and 2005-2008.

	Ever since I was a little boy, I was short. Not short in talent, but short in people’s minds.  All I wanted to do was play sports, but people, including parents and even coaches, had a preconceived idea of what was considered a good athlete. Not only was I not given a chance, but especially in my elementary school days, I was constantly belittled for my “disability.” This type of attitude toward me hardened me and shaped me into the person I am today. It became my life goal to prove these people wrong. And I did. 
	My favorite sport growing up was basketball, and by the time I reached the fourth grade I was about a head shorter than everyone else. The league we played in had an A level division for all of the “good” players, and a B level league for the kids who weren’t good enough. Every year, despite tearing up the B league, I was placed on the B level team. The rationale for it was that I was too small. 
	I was promised by the Freshman basketball coach at my high school that size wouldn't matter in high school, and he was right. By the time high school rolled around, everything changed for me. I didn’t grow taller, but the people changed. The politics of youth sports was no longer an issue. My height no longer was a frowned upon by the coaches and whoever played the best in practice would take the court during games. I was one of those guys.	
	Today, after my junior year, I can say to myself confidently that I beat the stereotype. I was the captain of the basketball team last year, and garnered all league honors on the lacrosse team as well. The lesson that I have taken from this is that no one can tell you what you can or cannot do. It is central to my identity today and is the building block for the rest of my life.

Be Brutal.",The-Dude-abides,5,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1iiyut/statement_of_purpose_pretty_selfexplanatory_be/,"My interest in serving with the SCA was the result of my experiences that have inspired my search and sparked my passion for environmental sciences and natural resources. Before earning my degree in business administration I began applying to Peace Corps. Working a year out of college, feeling having done well for myself, I felt a need to serve those less fortunate and at the beginning of the next year, I joined Peace Corps and served in Moldova for two years. Part of the service is to live with average income households. In Moldova, this meant helping with family and neighbors with necessary agricultural projects, sharing time, food, and work. During this time, I sensed the connection between the environment and Humans, more than ever. I was inspired to learn more of natural resources, sustainability, and environmental stewardship. As I learned I began to narrow my search for my career path. Hence, after completing Peace Corps I interned at Plenitud Eco-Educational Initiatives where I practiced sustainable architecture, self-maintained agriculture, ecological design, and other sustainability techniques in Puerto Rico. Plenitud implements principles of perma-culture and I learned more about how real sustainability can be possible. In pursuance of sustainability, I think how our resources are managed and studied must be based on principles of environmental stewardship and conservation. Our limited resources are increasingly scarce in this era of great growth in population and technological advancement. I am applying to graduate schools in related areas because I think it is imperative to intelligently and effectively conserve, study, and manage the environmental resources available. Gaining skills and training from the National Parks Service would strengthen my candidacy to these graduate programs.

I have been admitted to Missouri University's School of Natural Resources and explored potential research interests and projects with my adviser. However, before starting school in a new field, I feel it prudent to first take time to work and gain experience in natural resources; this would add much more value to my education and research assistantships. I could find fulfilling either working an internship or corps position; Both types of assignments have openings where I can receive various trainings of which I can take great advantage. I can employ my new skills in positions with other parks or elsewhere and I am interested in medical training to qualify for corps leadership positions. Having visited the websites and read more than a few of the postings, I know that I would like the professional culture and work.

My experience with Plenitud assures that I personally, would enjoy the type of work found through the conservation corps. I loved learning about ecological practices and sustainability in Puerto Rico, and with Plenitud I assisted with sustainability projects, doing tasks very similar if not the same as many of the duties and responsibilities listed in position postings. For example, removing invasive species, taking inventory of plants in the nursery and on the farm, doing construction work, and managing erosion. I also had the pleasure of leading projects with both local and national student volunteers at Plenitud. I trained several new interns in adobe-bag construction as well as student volunteers in agro-forestry. I value the exchange of knowledge and am not only interested in the SCA because I will like it, but because my experience allows me to do the work well and do good in the community.

Like most, I aspire for fulfilling and enjoyable work, and it is good luck to have the opportunity to serve a project with which I hold personal significance. The skills and training I will receive as part of these projects will allow me to continue working in this field, which enables one to serve nature, with professionals joined together for this common purpose.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,1374112204.0,,,True,t3_1iiyut,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1iiyut/statement_of_purpose_pretty_selfexplanatory_be/,

When I sat down to write this speech I became so overwhelmed at how much I wanted to say. When there are so many amazing things to say it’s almost impossible to choose. I can’t even begin to put into words how incredibly lucky I feel to have such an incredible best friend. I feel that we are soul mates in our own way. We have been through different colleges, different cities, and come out stronger than ever. She is someone I always know that I can trust with absolutely anything.

We have done a lot of amazing things together. From Disney World 400 times and to visit her amazing family in Scotland ( shout out) and countless other places. We've been on stage together and swam with the dolphins. Those things are all great, but the most amazing parts of our friendship are the small things. Drinking a few bottles of wine and laughing at the bachelor. The fact that when I drink too much she will follow me around with a Swiffer wet jet, and then tuck me in with water. How our friends have become each others friends, and how our families have become each other’s families.

One of the things I love about J is how she will always fight for you, whether it be someone who steals your seat at a bar or the guy she wants. When she met P in college, she knew he was the right guy, and she did not give up until he realized that she was the right girl. It might have taken P a while to realize J was the right girl since I'm pretty sure he didn't want the baggage of her crazy best friend, me. The first time I met P..we got off to a bit of a rough start. I nearly killed him going the wrong way down a one way street, then tried taking him to a park that didn’t even exist anymore. Despite all that I can say with all the sincerity in the world that he has become one of my best friends and favorite people.

J and P are an exceptionally awesome couple. There are not a lot like them. They open their home to me and others on a weekly basis, and are generous and loving to their friends and each other. Being around them is always a phenomenal experience. Being together for ten years through college and your twenties is not always an easy thing to do. So many couples falter during these tough years. They have both made sacrifices for their relationship, J moving to NY for P's job, then P back to Boston when J got into Harvard. It’s that kind of love, and unwavering support that makes a marriage work.

I love both of these two so much, I can’t imagine life without them together in it. I wish them nothing but the best! Cheers!

Nationalism has two definitions as defined by Oxford dictionary, the first is a patriotic feeling, patriotic principles or efforts, and the second is, an extreme version of definition one, often marked by a feeling of superiority over other nations.  I feel that we should only grasp nationalism up to the point were the second definition begins and never crossing into that feeling of superiority. Nationalism is a force that can provide amazing benefits to your nation but, when brought up to the level of the second definition, when it becomes a form of ultranationalism it can just as easily tear it down. When you start to feel superior to others, you start to treat them with less respect and often animosity, as demonstrated by the Rwandan genocide between Tutsi's and Hutu's. If we only take the good side of nationalism, those patriotic feelings and actions, and attempt to better our nation, amazing things can happen, just look at what Hitler did for Germany before WWII. One of the hardest parts about moderation in anything is knowing when you've reached the line, when you've gotten to the balancing point where you are gaining and no one is suffering, Stalin is an excellent example of overstepping that boundary, he believed the Ukrainian people were worth less than the Soviet Union and thus ended up crushing them with a forced famine.


When Stalin came to power in the late 1920's he declared that all of Ukraine's farmland would become state owned and that people were to work on collective farms instead of their traditional way of life on regular farms, working to support themselves and their families. Many of the farmers rebelled by burning their crops and slaughtering their livestock instead of handing it over to the Soviet Union. Joseph Stalin responded by shipping the remaining Ukrainian wheat stocks to  Russia and sealing off the Ukraine’s borders. This border sealing meant that no one could get out to buy food and no one could get in to sell food, combine that with the lack of farming and thousands of people died of starvation. Stalin thought that he was benefiting his nation by taking all the food from the Ukrainian people, and he was, but his methods ended up killing thousands of Ukrainian people. Stalin overstepped the boundary from helping your own nation, into crushing another's nation. Stalin was building an empire, he was bettering his nation in many ways, and was even praised for it by  western news sources, but because he over stepped that boundary, because he decided to hurt other people to further his wants, and because he justified this act by implying the Ukrainians were 'less', he became just another tyrant and ended up getting his nation destroyed. Although this act ended in death and destruction, it started out mostly positive,  Russia was becoming a better place and the people were benefiting, but not all nationalist acts that end in violence began with good intentions. 


When the Hutu's rebelled against the Tutsi's there were no good intentions, the Hutu's wanted the Tutsi's dead because of years of being treated as lower class citizens. The Hutu's believed they were better than the Tutsi's and deserved their revenge. This is a classic example of nationalism brought to a level of ultranationlism, this is an extreme form of nationalism. It's past the point of simply thinking your nation is better and the other nation is worse and into the territory of racism or possible genocide. When you start to believe other people are worth less than you, you start to treat them worse, because of this many situations escalate to levels that are just unnecessary, if the Hutu's and Tutsi's had had their leaders sit down and discuss the issues and come to a conclusion, maybe using the U.N. as moderators, maybe their wouldn't have been almost one million deaths. Entering into a situation with hot blood and intense ultranationalistic feelings in your veins there will always be conflict. Loving your nation is fine, and working to better it is great, but destroying other people because you think they are not as worthy as you is undeniably wrong.


A lot of people think of Adolf Hitler and only remember the genocide of the Jewish people, but they often forget about what he did before WWII. I'm not trying to make a case for Hitler and say 'he was a good guy, really'  no I wouldn't, I couldn't, do that. Hitler was ultimately a bad guy, he killed millions of people simply because they didn't fit his idea of a perfect world, but before he crossed that line, he started by trying to make his country better in other ways. He saw a country demoralized and left destroyed by the treaty of Versailles, he also saw a way to fix it, he started up the Nazi party, not just as a political and military force but also as a place for children and young men and women. There were clubs much like boy scouts and girl scouts, there were classes for young women to go to so they could learn how to raise a family. There were sports teams and music clubs. He even started the first ever anti-smoking campaign, Hitler did an amazing thing for his country, he gave Germany's citizens a new ideal to strive for, of a better, more powerful Germany one not bound by the treaty of Versailles. Of course this didn't last, Hitler quickly spread his messages of hate and superiority over everyone else and that is the moment he went to far with his nationalist views. At first he just wanted Germany to be a better place to live, somewhere that everyone could enjoy life and live well. He used his nationalist views in an effort to actively further his nation,but as he took his views up to the level of that second definition, up to the level of ultranationalism, he brought death to millions upon millions of people. That line, that act of moderation is what defines how much we should display our nationalism.


In conclusion nationalism is a good thing as long as it is never brought to the level of ultranationalism, up to the level hate and racism. An analogy that I think fits very well is one about sports, when two people get together to discuss hockey they often support different teams, if someone supported the Calgary Flames and another person supported the Edmonton Oilers both of these people can still sit down and discuss their love of hockey and the love they have for their respective teams without destroying each other and hurting everyone around them. People should be able to talk about how great of a place the world is and how we can make it better without hurting other people, of course that rivalry between nations will still be there, and that is fine, as long as it can be put aside when we need to solve global issues and find ways to make the planet better for everyone. The Hutu's thought they were better than the Tutsi's and ended up leaving a nation in turmoil. Stalin thought that making Russia a better place was more important than the well being of the Ukrainian people and he ended up remembered as a tyrant. When Hitler attempted to better his nation he took it to far by trying to eliminate the races he saw as worthless. We should accept nationalism as long as it doesn't harm anybody else, no matter what we think of them.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,1371687955.0,,,True,t3_1gk63z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1gk63z/an_essay_i_wrote_for_my_grade_11_socials_class/,

The Wooden Play Structure

My fondest memories from when I was young were the times I spent at an enormous playground at a school in Wilsonville then went to the nearby Willamette River with my family and the other daycare kids. My mom used to babysit, so she took all of us to a huge wooden play structure and my dad met us after for lunch at the nearby river, it was my favorite place to go as a child. We spent the whole day playing there.


We left early in the morning, the long car ride was buzzing with energy and anticipation. The school’s gigantic wooden structure was our first stop on the trip. To my kid sized self, it seemed miles long. My first stop of the playground was the somewhat old tire swing. I ran as fast as I could to get there, because it was always highly contested. Once I was tired of the swing, or yelled at enough that it was someone else's turn – it was time to move onto one of the other activities. 

Next, we played a game of water balloon wars. We spent forever filling them up, since we always ran out so quickly. We separated into four teams, each team to one of the four towers that stood at opposing ends of the war zone. If we were hit by two balloons then we were out for that turn. The winning team was whoever had the last man standing. We started playing just as it was getting hot out, so even though getting hit by a balloon signaled defeat, the cool water splashing on us helped refresh us.  After about two turns it turned into an all-out war where no one was out anymore, just water balloons flying from every direction until we ran out.

 
On rare occasions, the school hosted an art fare. We only saw it twice out of all the times we went to that school. They had amazing chalk artists come and draw really big and elaborate art; my favorite was of a castle with a knight fighting a dragon. It was the biggest chalk art I had ever seen. The castle looked so real that I could almost feel the cold bricks and sense of danger in the air. The dragon was almost as big as the castle, green, and spit fire at the knights. It looked amazing. We also did finger paintings of our favorite dinosaurs; mine was a Pterodactyl, soaring high above the rest of the dinosaurs. One time, we all made my mom a giant birthday card since her birthday was coming soon. We drew hearts, diamonds, and all of the kids hugging her, and then we all signed it. She was very surprised when we gave it to her and she really loved it. We all enjoyed the fare a lot; I wish it had been there more often.
	

There was also an undercover area where we played wall ball. The wall was massive, beige, and covered in circular dirt marks from previous games. My older brother was much taller than the rest of us, so he always won when we first started going there. But after a few years he stopped going and then it was down to my friend Taylor and me as contested champions. We had to let them play one on two to make it fair sometimes. We often spent hours challenging each other until we could barely breathe. It was so hot we could see the heat waves emanating off the asphalt, beads of sweat formed on our foreheads then dripped into our eyes. Although exhausted, we kept playing until it was time to leave for the park down the street.
	
In the afternoon we left for the nearby park. It always smelled of freshly cut grass and the nearby field of various flowers created a lovely aroma for miles. This is where my dad came to join us. We all ate our bagged lunches at the brown picnic tables while sitting in the shade to avoid the scorching heat. The food was never exciting, mostly just peanut butter and jelly. But I really enjoyed seeing my dad before he got off work. He could only stay until we had finished lunch, so sometimes I ate as slow as I could. It made me happy that he was able to join us, even if only for a little while.
	
After lunch we played on the metal see-saw, trying to launch the other person as high as we could. It broke after a few visits; it was not made for five people to jump on it apparently. There was also a structure that had a circular platform that had two perpendicular bars for us to hang onto. We piled as many people onto it as possible and then others spun it as fast as they could. Often people flew off of it into the freshly cut grass. The ones that weren’t thrown off were forced to try and jump off or endure it until the cruel spinners decided to stop. We spent the next minutes with our heads spinning miserably, but it was well worth it.
	
Eventually, we walked down to the Willamette River. We jumped off the nearby dock, doing tricks into the frigid water. One of the kids learned how to do a back-flip off it. The water was chilly but refreshing after a long day of playing in the blistering sun. The gigantic boats that passed by got everyone ecstatic; they created huge waves for us to try and ride to the shore. We played it in for hours, even after the sun had gone down over the hill and we were blue in the lips. 

After that, we played a game with my dog Beau. He was amazing at finding whatever we threw for him. We picked up rocks and threw them as far as we could. He always managed to come back with the exact one we threw out of the thousands available to him. I can still hear him almost choking from excitement after finally finding it. His mouth clenched so tight that it was restricting his breath. He pawed at us to keep playing, but we had to stop to make sure he didn’t drown. The trip ended after the river because it was time for the daycare kids to be picked up, but if we had it our way we would have played there much longer.
	
In conclusion, it was my favorite place to visit as a kid. I wish it hadn’t been an hour away so we could have gone there more often, but that also helps add to how special it is to me. I will always treasure the memories that we made there and I can’t wait to one day take my kids there.

( I have no title page yet) The paper has been pasted below! Thanks a bunch! 

Extreme climate change has been occurring from the time of the industrial revolution and will continue happening if humans do not start a “green revolution” to tackle these problems. We know about the Earth’s solar radiation budget and how most energy is absorbed, around 70% by the earth which warms the Earth.  But we also know that the solar activity is not getting all that much hotter from its cycles and has a very miniscule effect on temperature and global warming. So according to study’s we now know that this climate change and global warming is being caused by something other than the sun.  Also, the Sun causes different areas of climate on earth which are called biomes such as rainforests and deserts. While humans keep polluting, the climate will keep changing and so will the Earth. It will have to deal with more energy being trapped in the atmosphere and this could adversely affect the Earth’s natural biomes.
	Continuing the discussion of the Earth’s solar radiation budget, first of all what is the solar budget you might ask. Well the solar budget is a term used to describe how much energy the Earth gets from the Sun and how much of that energy the Earth-system radiates back to outer space. The Earth absorbs most of this solar incident energy around 70% which is mostly absorbed by land masses and water and the amount of solar energy absorbed is around 51%. Also greenhouse gases effect this because greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide trap energy that is being reflected by the earth. And these greenhouse gases keep solar radiation within the atmosphere, which humans are contributing to by polluting the atmosphere by burning hydrocarbons for an example. Greenhouse gases are the leaders in climate change and are mostly at fault for it, but this is something humans can change and prevent.
	Furthermore, humans have a lot do with global warming and the climate change that is occurring on a global scale. We know that some of the Sun’s radiation is simply absorbed naturally through a natural greenhouse effect, which raises the earth’s surface temperature about 15-16 degrees Celsius. But humans are causing even more solar radiation to be trapped within the atmosphere which heats the Earth’s surface even more! And this can be very bad for the world’s ecosystems and distinct biomes. How this global warming occurs is that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour which is the most abundant one, these absorb radiation from the Sun and emits it at a thermal infrared range which heats the Earth. Now they are not all that bad because we need these natural ones to support life on Earth without them Earth could not hold and absorb heat.
	



Regarding human activity and how it’s related to climate, over the last 50 years 90% of global warming has been most likely caused by humans according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which is a United Nations agency. Over the last 150 years carbon dioxide levels have increased significantly within the atmosphere from around 280ppm (parts per million) to over 379ppm! As I said previously we need greenhouse gases to survive, for example Mars has a very thin atmosphere full of carbon dioxide but very trace amounts or no one at all of methane and water vapour which are critical to support life. But we are putting too much in the atmosphere from burning hydrocarbons and also polluting CFCs and HCFCs in the atmosphere which is contributing to global warming. 
As a consequence of global warming and climate change the earth will become warmer which could become disastrous for some areas and more welcome for others. Also this change in climate could cause more areas to have more precipitation and therefore make them wetter and some areas will become extremely dry with little to no precipitation which could cause extreme drought.  Also the greenhouse effect will increase due to the pollution by humans; the carbon dioxide that is polluted could help some crops and help them grow in large numbers. But on the other hand the heat from pollution could completely wipe out these crops because of their inability to adapt to fast changing climate change, the same could happen to specialised species that live in very specific biomes such as rainforests and arctic tundra. Finally global warming can attribute to the melting of glaciers and arctic ice which will cause sea levels to rise significantly.
Despite all of these significant consequences there are things we can do to help slow down this process of global warming and climate change. First of all we could use more sustainable power plants and limit the use of power plants like coal which are extremely inefficient and produce tonnes upon tonnes of pollution. Examples of these alternative power sources could be wind, solar, wave power which still has to be researched further but later on but these could become our main sources of power. Also we must recycle more and use less power and water all together and become more efficient as a species, also we can simply plant more trees to offset climate change. Lastly as I recall the from the movie The Inconvenient Truth there was an idea to increase the albedo effect of cities by literally painting them white to reflect more solar radiation back out to outer space.




Having considered climate, it is also a reasonable look at its relationships with biomes because biomes and the climate have a very important relationship. First of all a biome for those who don’t know is a large naturally occurring community with specific organisms which thrive in different climates. The relationship between climate and biomes are mostly between the amounts of precipitation that occurs in the area, for example we see a biome like a rainforest which has lots of precipitation which supports very specialized and distinct biotic organisms. And we can look at its polar opposite a subtropics desert which experiences little to no precipitation and also supports very specialized and distinct organisms. And this has to do with climate and climate change could really hurt these distinct biomes by either completely changing their precipitation patterns and temperature which could adversely affect the organisms in them.
In addition to climate and its relationship with biomes, solar energy has a great impact on biomes also. For example solar energy is so great in deserts that solar power plants are being built to provide massive of energy to regions around these deserts and could completely power them but we still do not have a way to store this energy. Solar energy in case of temperate places like rainforests helps plants and trees and species thrive unlike a biome like a desert which gains a massive amount of solar energy. The plants in these rainforests also help the climate with turning carbon dioxide into oxygen which occurs in the process of photosynthesis.
For this reason all of these articles information are related in multiple ways through the relationship between biomes and how they are related to the climate and solar energy in the ways of temperature and precipitation. Also climate change and global warming can have a negative effect on individual and distinct biomes by either destroying them or creating new ones to support new species. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will have an effect on the global warming on earth which will affect these biomes also.  Finally the solar budget of earth which is how much solar radiation the earth absorbs and reflects the budget will see an increase in the area of absorption due to the increased manmade greenhouse gas pollution by the burning of several hydrocarbons. Finally, also the destruction of our ozone layer can be attributed to this due to things like CFCs and HCFCs.

My personal design process is based around the belief that architectural process is not linear but a series of natural circular processes that are based on information, intuition and language. As I begin a design I allow possibilities to encircle the problem to the point where it can be understood and comforted in all’s its relationships. In other words is an exploration above else. The reason I present exploration as the sole objective of my design process is because exploration as in science is driven mostly by intuition and data gathered.  As I begin the design I explore large number of ideas at a quick pace, whether the ideas can become the architectural object is not an object of priority, the task is to eliminate and get all the possibilities out, while creating language, spatial identity and cite context. As the process moves forward it also moves back, when certain solutions fail, emerging explorations begin to be tweaked based on the previous schemes and past explorations. The result is an expansion from logical to associative coherence in a natural circular pattern where one language feeds of another. In the case of the nature center and parker elementary school, a language of contrast was explored in order to create geometry that reflected the usage of two different groups of people. The nature center was created by the push and pull of the visitors. The visitors who used the trails and where familiar with the cite where encouraged to move faster thru the building while having partial access to  the interior context, the unfamiliar visitors where pooled in an area that was activated by more static program  and allowed to be  experience a more calm building. In this case the main objective was to reflect the needs of the people visiting. For parker elementary school the project was heavily explored on how kids learn, what makes up 21st century learning, and cite context. First question the design process was of how to use the building to protect the park and kids from the busy street. Initial studies suggested to use the parking lot as a barrier, but this prevented the building from getting northern light. As explorations began to circulate the solution was to combine two ideas. One idea presented a living façade and one presented the barrier concept. This two ideas merged with the main concept of contrast and created a balanced environment. The very minimalist geometry of the school contrasted against the highly saturated and active environment inside (contrast), this projected the kid’s movements and energy into the park and the neighborhood (living façade). The side facing the street was stacked with more adult programs and layered to protect the kids and the park (barrier). As ideas merge and create new ideas the needs of the city and the community begin to control process and it heavily influxes the starting point. Since not all the first drafts have an architectural objectivity  this lets me as a designer to have more humanist ideas and languages that can become part of the architecture in the natural progression of the design.

1)The Houston arboretum project was based on the idea of conflicting concepts and how they can become a single balanced environment within the architecture.
The building programs were analyzed and an ideal fast and slow circulations paths where created. This paths allowed the program to interact with an “external force” depending if the program was more important to the bike path or pedestrian path. the programs that interacted with  the fast moving circulation where forced to “stick” out of the ground, allowing for a fast view of the building, while the slower circulation ;the pedestrians were allow to enter the central court yard and experience a different aspect. The building was cited in order to function with the paths as a source of information, this created a building that had a violent contrast in geometry depending on the location of the visitor.

2)Houston is made up of many different types of cultures and this project shows a repose to the Houston environment and incites alternative methods of design. As the project began we were given the assignment of researching various cultures and its characters in design. From the research I created two concepts that reflected ambiguity and one that reflected clarity, for ambiguity the made textiles where studied for patterns that allowed a natural transition into architecture. As the project progress the textiles began to take form into three major curves that were based on how the hat is hand crafted and the movement of the fiber .as a formal architectonic response to the research, the created space began to dance and the ground was allowed to loop around the space creating a never ending sensation with large open spaces.

3)Arts place museum was influenced on the personal idea that film and art should be experienced individually and in close proximity. With the idea of individualism various modular spaces were created. Each of the modules offered a singular experience according to the transparency and location within the building. This idea of a personal experience evolved into an architectonic response of creating a space about discovery, as the visitor moves the experiences changes dramatically from subunit to subunit, between floors they are gaps that allow light to be brought to the interior, but the staggering and missing units change the environment from floor to floor. The difference in transparencies in glass bathe and dance with the cold polish concrete shell. The structural elements of the project also play a key import feature in the design. The close proximity of the columns accentuate the modules and allow for a thin two way concrete slab to be used as a structure system . This relatively thin floor slabs accentuates the large glass panels and light that bathes the panels 

4)The approach to this project was to search what in architecture could affect a musician and listener. What are the aspects which affect the artistic the expression of a child learning music? As conceptualization began the concept of space a musician creates through music was interpreted as space full of color and a well establish rhythm. This idea of color and a datum drove the design process.The simple building geometry contrasted heavily to the activity in the interior, thru the use of color and patterning, the interior begins bleed out, and allows the movement and noise created by the kids to become part of the building, thus creating a moving façade. The relationship between music and architecture can also be seen in plan and the idea of weaving the music classroom into the everyday life. As in music a strong datum was created allowing the building to have a colorful and engaging interior. The datum became the learning corridor as research into 21st century learning was used, this corridor serves as a clear story bringing light to the interior while the music classrooms are allowed to extend to the space and begin to dance as musical notes in a sheet.

**Background to current problems**

Syria has been ruled for decades by an Islamic sect called The Alawites, which is currently headed by Bashar al-Assad. The Alawites have maintained their power because of the support they receive from a conflicting religious group: Syrian Christians. This support stems from the fact that the alternative ruling party would be led by Sunni Muslims, who have long oppressed Christians in other countries (such as in Egypt, where the leading Sunni party has committed atrocious acts against the minority Coptic Christian population).

The Alawites receive external support from Iran, which is mostly a Shi’ite Muslim country. Iran likes the fact that Syria is a non-Sunni country, which counterbalances the heavily-Sunni Middle East.

The previous dictator of Syria, Hafez-al-Assad, died in 2000. His son (who should have taken over control) was killed in a car crash, leaving his second son, Bashar al-Assad, to take power. He held this role fairly comfortably up until the “Arab Spring” protests in 2011, which is where the current conflict started to evolve.

Most countries dealt with the Arab Spring protestors in a way which would be unthinkable in the Western world, but Syria’s army were particularly brutal in their repression. However, rather than backing down, many Syrian people decided they could take the opportunity to attempt to overthrow the dictatorship once-and-for-all. This led to rebel groups forming, who initially used makeshift weapons against al-Assad’s greatly superior artillery and air forces. Many other Syrian people attempted to flee the country, which led to hundreds of thousands of refugees flooding into Turkey (which is not a supporter of the Syrian regime for many historical reasons).

This fighting has slowly developed into a full-scale civil war, but al-Assad is still in a position of power (although he is no longer recognised as the Syrian leader by many countries). He has always referred to the rebel groups as “terrorists” and he says he is fighting to remove the terrorist threat and return Syria to the Syrian people.


**Who else is involved?**

The people fighting on a daily basis started out as Syrian government forces against Syrian civilians. However, more recently, the war has started to take on a different (and even more disturbing) form.

External forces were initially welcomed into the ranks of the rebels but it has become clear that a large number of these new recruits are jihadists, or fundamentalist Muslims. These people are less concerned with freeing Syria from the dictatorship and more concerned with taking advantage of the turmoil to impose new Salafist rules on the country (basically fundamentalist Muslim laws). One notable group is called the Al Nusra Front, who are closely linked to the Al Quaeda movement.

The Syrian government army have also been joined by external forces, primarily from the Hezbollah group, who are widely considered a terrorist organisation. This group, who are based in Lebanon and receive backing from Syria and Iran, consists of Shi’ite Muslims who are committed to fighting against Western countries and their allies (particularly Israel). This means that two organisations which are recognised as terrorists in the UK and US are now fighting against each other in what started as a Syrian civil war.

The current conflict is unique in some way because of the fact that there has not been an invasion, or even a strong intervention, by Western forces (e.g. the United Nations or the US). The US has repeatedly said they will not put “boots on the ground” in Syria but they have recognised that the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian army would be a “game changer”, which could then be a possible catalyst for invasion.

Syria is one of a handful of countries which refused to sign the “Chemical Weapons Convention” and they originally denied they held any chemical weapons. However in 2012 they admitted holding stocks of various chemical weapons, including Sarin and mustard gas. There have been unconfirmed reports that both the rebels and the Syrian government forces have used chemical weapons, which both groups vehemently deny.

Israel is the only country who has directly attacked Syria recently. On 5th May 2013, Israeli planes caused a number of large explosions in the Syrian capital of Damascus. The Israelis later said this attack was directed at a delivery of sophisticated weapons headed to the Lebanon, where they would be supplied to the Hezbollah group and potentially used against Israel.


**Possible outcomes**

The turmoil in Syria is constantly changing and there are too many variables to accurately predict what will happen next. There are some more recent fears that fighting in and around the Golan Heights (an area between Israel and Syria which was seized by Israel in 1967 and has been controlled by them ever since) will cause Israel to become gradually more involved in the war.

Most commentators think that the US will avoid getting embroiled in the conflict for numerous reasons .The main concern is that Syria is more heavily armed than other countries (such as Libya), particularly in terms of their air force. Syria has also been supplied with more sophisticated weapons recently by Russia, who has long been a major arms supplier to Syria. The Russians defended this transaction by citing their long-standing arms trade agreements with Syria, but this has been silently condemned by many countries because it will make any possible foreign intervention much more difficult.

Therefore it seems likely that the conflict will continue long into the future, with other parties continuing to join what started as a civil war. The United Nations (and some other countries) may try to assist the rebels indirectly by supplying them with arms rather than the non-lethal support which has been provided to date. An unfortunate side effect of this type of fighting , particularly for the UK and US, is that volatile warzones like this can easily allow fundamentalist terrorist groups to grow and gain various weapons.

The ideal solution for all parties (particularly the UK and US) would be a cessation of the war and an elected leader, because this could reduce the high level of instability in the Middle East. There have been talks between the US and Russia to organise a Syrian peace conference but the Syrian government have not shown much willingness to send any representatives to the meetings.

Unfortunately, even if Bashar al-Assad steps down or gets assassinated, the conflict is not likely to stop because there will be a continuing battle to decide who will achieve the ultimate position of power.

Whilst this is still going on, there will undoubtedly be further in-fighting because the different groups that have now joined the war all have very different plans for Syria and its remaining people.

Sometimes the wants and needs of the beings on the watery sphere came to her in wailings and sometimes as soft and unnoticed as a heartbeat.  The starry-eyed goddess collected them all and took them within herself.  She answered the pure and good desires by a tipping of planets, a breath of spring rain, or the seasonal tilt of the sphere on its axis.
	But the goddess grew lonely in her existence and her heart had become so heavy with the wishes of the world.  She felt a wish well up from within; her own desire for companionship, for some way to share the burden of the wants and needs that the world she cared for so deeply lifted up to her.  So the goddess cast about for something with which to craft a companion.  She gathered together great armfuls of snowcloud from the frigid skies above the northern and southern poles.  With this soft, shimmering substance she began the work of molding a man.
	She sculpted a strong chest and powerfully gentle arms, legs fit for running, jumping, and dancing.  She took great care to create the most nimble set of fingers and then began to delicately shape the face.  She crafted a noble bone structure and button nose, she formed a pair of full, smirking lips and wisely set eyes.  With a smile the goddess added ears that gave a pleasantly impish look to her new formed man.  Now the goddess placed her lips over the cold lips of her still cloud man.  She breathed a lifetime of wishes into her creation.  As she did so she felt her own soul lighten and the man form stirred in her arms.
	The goddess stepped back and observed her companion in dismay.  Her man was indeed beautiful but he blinked uncomprehendingly at the stars around him and his wonderfully articulated limbs moved in a clumsy and disjointed fashion.  The goddess called to him but his ears did not hear.  The wishes pulsed beneath his skin in a chaotic tumult.  He could not order his own life force.  There were too many wishes for one newborn being to handle at once.  The goddess knew she must do something so she held his trembling form close to her breast.  She held him tight, squeezed him until he was small.  Her lovely companion was now no larger than a loaf of bread.  He was still helpless but now he could grow into the wishes that filled him and fulfill them one by one.  
	The goddess smiled at the newborn cloud child now sleeping peacefully in her arms.  Then she looked down onto the earth she loved so much and she knew that her lovely cloud child could have no better home.  And so she flew down to earth and lighted in a garden.  She wove him a blanket of birdsong and gently nestled the babe in the center of a huge, lush rose blossom.  And then the goddess placed a soft kiss over each of the cloud child’s sleeping eyes and left him in the garden to fulfill the wishes of the earth.

I thankfully have that opportunity, and will do everything in my power to achieve this goal as well as thrive in any situation that arises as an officer. I know how to approach and achieve a long term goal in a holistic fashion that ensures success from being a dedicated marathon runner. “Train hard, win easy,” is the laconic phrase that captures my mentality in all of my endeavors, but especially marathon running. To succeed in such a physically demanding undertaking, one has to overcome many voluntary discomforts and remain  assiduously focused. One must willingly sacrifice tremendous amounts of time and energy to the cause, endure months of constant surveillance of dietary and sleeping habits, as well as plan and execute optimal training schedules. When people ask me for advice about running a marathon, I tell them being a runner has to become a lifestyle, not a hobby; much like being an officer is a lifestyle, not just a job. The drive, determination, and discipline necessary to achieve success in a marathon are qualities that undoubtedly will serve me well as an officer in the United States Navy. 
	While I understand personal motivation and competence are important, the Navy is not about individual success; the much more noble ethic of teamwork is the foundation upon which all great achievements are built. I share this belief with the Navy, and as a leader I will make sure the team's goal always trumps any individualistic precept. I have been in leadership roles ranging from captaining sports teams, tutoring high school students, and being a Teaching Assistant in college. The challenges and responsibilities varied with each position, but the goal was always the same: identify the best strategy to accomplish the group's objective and execute it. This was true whether it was winning the district championship as a captain, tutoring a student to help him pass his entrance exam, or guiding undergraduate lab groups through their final project as a Teaching Assistant. I cherished the opportunity to lead others to success in each of these situations, and I look forward to continuing this trend in the most distinguished and eminent team in the world, the United States Navy.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,1369717028.0,,,True,t3_1eyv2a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1eyv2a/400_word_motivational_statement_for_navy_ocs/,

The creation of the Peace Corps impacted both modern and historic America by recognizing the responsibility society has to create peace. In 1961, John F. Kennedy released his first statement on his creation of the Peace Corps. The initial impact helped develop and improve the countries that volunteers worked in. The Peace Corps have continued to facilitate third world countries and humanize America.
        John F. Kennedy officially created the American Peace Crops on March 1, 1961. Kennedy’s intention was to send skilled American volunteers across the world to work and improve third world countries. The President had asked universities, labor unions, volunteer agencies and other industries to help him in his attempt to progress the world. His dedication to the corps made it what it is today and helped the growth of American humanitarianism. Americans were impressively quick to dedicate their lives in order to advance the lives of others. John F. Kennedy noted the pride he had for his country in his first announcement of the Peace Corps. (Kennedy, John F.)
       Initially, the Peace Corps were created to send willing Americans across the world to improve and maintain peace with other countries. (Kennedy, John F.) American volunteers worked in third world countries to develop and improve their stability as a nation. Ghana was the first mission the Peace Corps had sent volunteers on; the government sent 75 volunteers overseas. The first trip generated lots of press for the Peace Corps, news titles such as “Young Wilmette Man Leaves For Ghana” and “Graduate To Teach with Peace Corps in Ghana” were in local newspapers to promote the new establishment and to boast about the brave and willing volunteers (Peace Corps World Wide). America’s positive response to the trip to Ghana revealed a pride for their countries willingness to help others, and spread the do-good attitude to make the country a better place. John F. Kennedy hoped to create and advance peace between America and other countries. By doing this he bettered America along the way. The people of America began volunteering for many mission trips in countries like Canada, Australia, France, Britain and Japan. Kennedy spoke to Americans about fighting tyranny, poverty and disease; doing this increased American humanitarianism. (Coleman, David G.)
        The Peace Corps now has greatly developed as a program and changed America as a country. From 1961 to modern day, the Peace Corps has improved other countries and continued to thrive. Third world countries all over the globe have received help from the American Peace Corps and have become more industrialized, flourishing nations. Since the foundation began, there have been over 210,000 volunteers that have served in 139 countries. The growth of the Peace Corps from 1961 to now is evident and will continue to increase as the program continues to prosper (Peace Corps). America has become a better, and more united country with the development of the Peace Corps. Kennedy told Americans they must pledge their “best efforts to help them (third world countries) help themselves.” Obeying this, Americans fell to action and have yet to stop helping the world outside of their own. (Coleman, David G.) The dedication of American volunteers shows how the Peace Corps has impacted the entire country. 
        Although John F. Kennedy’s original program has improved greatly since its origination, America still takes on their responsibility of maintaining peace with other countries. Americans have become more generous, devoted people. Peace between nations is forming all around the world. The Peace Corps, from its initial foundation, has thrived and had tremendous impacts worldwide.

[Here is a Google Doc version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OIRhVpTKsAijijjVGOjAuzUtaWFUwAUe_jd8ZksWtKY/edit?usp=sharing)



**1.**

In the fast pace of American culture, listening is not a revered trait. Everywhere we go we hear discussion. Discussion on everything from global issues to simple small talk. Many people feel a need to maintain conversation. There is even a term for what they are avoiding “awkward silence”. **Communication plays a huge part of our lives, but we must differentiate between talking and connecting.** Much like what is portrayed in the movie Awakenings, when Robin Williams learns you can speak in ways beyond words. There is something that communicates much deeper than words could ever, it is human connection. 
	
**2.**

Humans can connect on a spectrum ranging from superficial to the realization of the oneness between humans. Conversation is important, but nowhere near as important as the feeling you give to others. As Maya Angelou once said “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”  I believe this holds true on a universal level, further justifying the potential that human connection can have. 

**3.**
The opening lines of the sacred Tao te Ching read “Those who speak do not know, those who know do not speak.” The wise sage realizes that talk is simply unneeded. **The flow of the Universe continues with or without our vocal input.** Be still for a moment. Take a deep breath, and listen. Breathe, and listen. Hear the symphony of life resonate on your ear drums. The Universe is an orchestra that is performing its’ infinite composition, and you have the best seat in the house. It is the song of living in this exact moment. It is always going on within you and around you. By practicing mindfulness, simply sitting and listening can be one of the greatest joys found in this existence. Simply being, and listening.

**4.**

Would you believe me if I said my greatest inspiration is also one of the most intimidating forces in my life? Picture a boy, betrayed by his mother while in her womb. Born into an environment where trust and love were not common expression. Growing up lacking shelter, adequate nutrition and any sort of stability, how is one supposed to develop? The hand dealt to this boy is not a fair one, but that is irrelevant. Through the beautiful working of the Universe, my path crossed with this boy. 

**5.**

Under a blanket of mental illness, learning disabilities, aggressive behavior and the inability to speak, there lies the most beautiful soul I know. This boy lives each day expressing himself without the tool of language. This is not to say he cannot communicate, but rather the rules of the game of communication are rewritten. Researchers state that up to 80% of communication is nonverbal. Body language, posture, awareness of anxiety and nervous tension all make up the vibration of the setting. Rather than a conversation, we share a vibration. It allows for expression of our mood, troubles on our minds, friendship to grow, and good times to share. 

**6.**

**Some people fear mental illness.** Stigma exists, and people resort to an “us and them” mentality. I argue that mental illness is a spiritual gift. It can shatter the ego, and brew compassion like nothing else can. The boy I work with does not have the limitation of language that all other people are hindered by. He truly has direct experience, all of the time. Rather than getting caught up in simple petty talk, he is able to embrace the flow of the universe, unhindered by language.

**7**

**Inspired by social relations and therapeutic measures, healthcare is a truly eye-opening experience.** I have been enlightened by the power of silence. Silence brings about mindfulness. mindfulness always applies. In everything you do in healthcare you must be mindful. You quickly learn to read people, read the situation, and notice your gut feelings to interpret what to do. Healthcare allows for the working out of the “Golden Rule”. 

**8**

This art of psychotherapy goes beyond the work realm of life. **Psychotherapy actually applies in nearly every situation of life.** Every interaction with someone is a chance to play the game. The therapist/patient relationship may be equated to a battle. Psychology is a set of weapons. The enemy is the ego. The battlefield is the mind. Combat skills come in the form of acceptance, appreciation, compassion and enlightenment. Victory in the psychotherapeutic battle comes when the patient sees the unreality of the ego. Problems just become a silly word to be thrown around, they are nothing real. 

**9**

I am the one who has truly been blessed from this work. I am the one who has gained the power of silence. While in public, just sit back and listen, you will realize you are a spectator at an event. You realize that the game of life goes on around you, and it will continue with or without your verbal input. The more and more I discover the beauty of being silent, the more I understand the Buddha’s noble silence.

**10**

How humorous it is to hear peoples’ arguments escalate, that the parties involved somehow forgot along the way that they are the same. Sometimes they yell as if to justify the louder their voice, the closer to truth they become. Some people prefer to jump in for the oxytocin, the chemical rush one gets from socialization. **I find the power of silence to bring a greater rush.** The feeling that everything is happening here and now for a reason, and that a carefully chosen silence and smile can serve as a better response than a thousand words.

This essay is for entrance into a[ summer political communications](http://www.emerson.edu/academics/professional-studies/programs-high-school-students/political-communication-program) program at Emerson. 

The topic of the essay is: In one or two pages, please describe 1) what you hope to achieve during the institute, and 2) an event you feel has prepared you for the Institute.

Im looking for any help i can get, whether it be correcting grammar or helping me write a better essay. Thanks

TEXT VERSION BELOW

Please state what you hope to achieve during the institute. and an event you feel has prepared you for the institute

   From the time I had become aware of the Political Communications program at Emerson College I knew it was a perfect fit for both my experiences and my goals. Since childhood I have developed a great interest in both politics and the role of language in shaping and conveying ideas. The summer program at Emerson focuses on how communication effects government, which is the basis for any change in political structure. If I would be given an opportunity to study at Emerson it would be extremely beneficial to me, a rising 9th grader at Cooper City High in Florida, as it would be another opportunity to help hone my skills for a future in public office. I have both the preparation and the dedication to succeed at a program such as this one.
	
   My experiences, both volunteering and in academia, have prepared me well for the program. In 2012 I volunteered for Barak Obama’s re-election campaign, Organizing for America. It was my job to solicit donations by phone from registered Democrats in order to further aid the campaign. Another responsibility I fulfilled was getting out the vote/canvassing, I did this by going door to door and offering voter information as well as gathering information to further aid the local campaign. My most rewarding task as part of Organizing for America was to register new voters. It was a privilege to assist people in exercising their First Amendment rights. 
	
   My interest in politics is also expressed in my academic choices. In 7th grade I took a government course in which I earned an “A”. As a 9th grader I challenged myself by taking an AP Human Geography course in which I am also excelling. Acquiring good communication skills is another ability I have developed by electing a journalism class. This class provides me the abiliity to write for my school newspaper, The Lariat, in which I both gather and report news, while also being able to write my own editorial pieces. This year, I have also chosen to run for student office so that I may help my school while also acquiring valuable leadership techniques. Additionally, my dedication and interest in politics can be seen on my bookshelf as well. In order to further shape my political beliefs while also providing me with a better understanding of government, I have chosen to read read literature such as Animal Farm, Atlas Shrugged, All the Kings Men, and The Communist Manifesto; learning philosophies and lessons from each of them. Reading has helped me broaden my understanding of politics and the world we live in, while also helping me better understand what effective writing is.
.

   Furthermore, this program will allow me to succeed both in the short and long term. I will be able to learn in a different environment then normal, and will be able to learn from educated and experienced professors who are experts in their respective fields. The program will also give me an opportunity to broaden my knowledge of the political system and allow me to further study political ideologies, something I am especially interested in. Honing my persuasion, and speech skills is also a task I greatly look forward to, as they are some of the most important tools, not just in politics but in life.The program will also give me a chance to visit and explore a historic city: Boston. I have never had the privilege of visiting the city, however I am aware of its historic and cultural significance to America (say something about the bombings) and would love the opportunity to visit its many historic sites. Above all, the program will help prepare me for a career in politics. In the future I will be able to build on this experience as it will help me acquire the skills needed to better serve my city, state, or country, something I hope to do in the future.
	

   In conclusion, this program would be a tremendous experience that could help me in numerous ways. I have experience working in politics and this program would be a tremendous boost. I am anxiously awaiting your response and hope that you believe I belong in the program as much as I do.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,1366584794.0,,,True,t3_1ctmmz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1ctmmz/essay_for_application_into_summer_political/,

&gt; *I met Ron in the late 80's on vacation. As soon as I met him, he made me feel like I'd known him forever. Right away, I realized he had a warm heart. After seeing how he treated Katie, Adam, Mark, and Matthew, I knew he had to be a special person to take on a responsibility of that magnitude.  I didn't see him for a few years after that, but he would call from time to time just to see how my family and I were doing.* 
    
&gt; *My wife and I started to visit going to visit him a few times a year after he moved to Hawk Point. We had a common interest in deer hunting, so he would set me up with a deer stand and a place to hunt every year. He would go above and beyond to make sure I had top notch spot to hunt every year.*
    
&gt; *Anyone who knew Ron had to know he liked his whiskey. We would sit out in his barn, and tell stories when I came down. One thing I knew about Ron was he never was one who was short of words (haha). As a matter of fact, sometimes he had too many words, and you would have to tell him, ""Hold on, bud. Let me say something."" But that was Ron - always chattering.*
     
&gt; *One thing about Ron - he loved to have parties, and he made sure that there was always plenty of food to eat. Sometimes, way too much, but that was alright. If it didn't get eaten, he would send you home with some. He wanted everyone to be happy and have fun at his parties.* 
    
&gt; *I don't think in my 65 years that I have ever met anyone quite like him. They broke the mold when they made him. He was a special person. Ron will be missed by alot of people. He was a warm, kind, and generous person who would give you the shirt off his back if he thought you needed it. I'm sure that anyone who knew him would have some very  wild and crazy stories to tell about him.* 
    
&gt; *Ron, if you're listening to this, I made a promise to you a long time ago that I would say something at your funeral, and...I tried. I love you, and will miss you dearly.""*

This essay looks sort of like a research paper, but that's not the case. The theory explored in this essay is my own; I didn't simply look up a theory pertaining to human morality online and proceed to write about it. Rather, I used facts regarding how we learn to be moral people, along with a basic understanding of evolution, to compose my theory. The purpose of this essay is to convince the reader that my theory makes sense, and they should believe it. Is this an OK way to write a persuasive essay? I thought it to be more enjoyable than simply arguing why some already conceived idea, law, etc. was important or unimportant.

Here is the passage itself: 

205. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, in fact, so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this fruit could still come to maturity. The extent and towering structure of the sciences have increased enormously, and therewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner, or will attach himself somewhere and ""specialize"" so that he will no longer attain to his elevation, that is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection, and his DESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his maturity and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and deteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no longer of much importance. It is perhaps just the refinement of his intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the way, he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a milleantenna, he knows too well that as a discerner, one who has lost his self-respect no longer commands, no longer LEADS, unless he should aspire to become a great play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and spiritual rat-catcher—in short, a misleader. This is in the last instance a question of taste, if it has not really been a question of conscience. To double once more the philosopher's difficulties, there is also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a Yea or Nay, not concerning science, but concerning life and the worth of life—he learns unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain this verdict, and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief only through the most extensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying) experiences, often hesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded. In fact, the philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude, either with the scientific man and ideal scholar, or with the religiously elevated, desensualized, desecularized visionary and God-intoxicated man; and even yet when one hears anybody praised, because he lives ""wisely,"" or ""as a philosopher,"" it hardly means anything more than ""prudently and apart."" Wisdom: that seems to the populace to be a kind of flight, a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a bad game; but the GENUINE philosopher—does it not seem so to US, my friends?—lives ""unphilosophically"" and ""unwisely,"" above all, IMPRUDENTLY, and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts and temptations of life—he risks HIMSELF constantly, he plays THIS bad game.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_19270f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/19270f/philosophy_essay_on_passage_205_from_nietzsches/,

My educational history feels almost non-existent, why do I say this? It is because it has created a huge void in my life. My education only went up to the sixth grade but it did not stop from shaping my identity as a student today. (Good intro, Rita – a little short, but your wording and sentence structure is much better than your first draft. You do have a “comma splice” in the first line you need to fix.)
One way my educational history has helped shape the student I am now is through suffering and the hurt from having parents who abused drugs, alcohol, and occasionally me. My mother did not care about what I did as long as I stayed out of her way, (comma splice here) if I didn’t there would be hell to pay. My mother was seventeen when she had us, I say us because I have an identical twin sister, Carita. We were brought home from the hospital to our grandmother’s house, where we lived until we were about two years of age. My mother decides (do you mean decided?) to go to a truck stop, where she would hitch a ride with one of the truckers, and go on a road trip wherever he was going. They would party the whole trip. We never knew where we were going, if or when we were coming back. When we did return, our grandmother was very angry and started yelling and screaming at my mother. This only made my mother pack our stuff and leave my grandmother’s. My mother and father decided to take off; they put us in the back seat of his 57 Chevy where they had put a play pin (playpen) in the back instead of the seats (you have no punctuation here and it is the end of the sentence) we ended up in Ozark Missouri. My father got a farm house. We had a horse named Charlie, chickens, pigs, cows and goats. My mom and dad would always be drinking and doing drugs; then the abuse would come out. My father would be beating my mom and I(we) would always try stopping him from hurting my mom, only ending up with black eyes and busted lips ourselves. My parents  would go out to parties, get too drunk to remember we were with them, and they would leave without us. Which was alright, because everyone knew the twins belonged to Roberta and Juan (dependent clause – beware of starting with “which”). Already I hated everyone and everything around me. This is a good paragraph and plenty of detail. Notice the grammar and sentence errors. Don’t get discouraged, Rita, but I do want you to learn from it. The more you see errors in your own writing, the better you will get at recognizing it the next time. You had a run-on sentence (no punctuation), a comma splice, and a fragment from a dependent clause in this paragraph. See if you can fix them.
I was physically abused when I was four; I stopped speaking to everyone but my sister. I would whisper in her ear and she would get whatever I asked her for. When we started school we were in the same class, (comma splicr) they tried to separate us, in the hope (or you could say hoping) I wouldn’t use my sister to speak for me. We only fought and screamed, until we were back together and I continued to whisper in my sister’s’ ear. School just did not seem to fit into my mother’s schedule, (another comma splice here) while I should have been leaning my ABCs, (no comma needed )I was at home with mom learning how to smoke weed instead. If I got lucky, and mom wasn’t sick or hung-over I might have been able to go to school, but that was not often. 
 Our father soon passed away when we were eleven, (comma splice) he died of cancer and apart(two words a part) of us all  died. Eventually I quit going to school altogether. My mom didn’t seem to care about anything anymore, (comma splice)she lost her world and wanted hers to end.  After he was gone, all I did was party with my mom and run the streets. Until someone called the social workers on her (this is confusing), they were getting ready to take us away. (Who is “they”? And do you mean “they” were getting ready to take you away until someone called the social workers or after?)That’s when I ended up on my grandmother’s front lawn, where my mom dropped me off and never came back. I got lots (a lot) of post cards and promises of visits that never came. My grandmother tried to get me to go to school and have a curfew, but I was already out of control. I did whatever I wanted whenever I wanted.  I was angry at the world, always asking why? Couldn’t it have been my mom?  When I was fourteen I was already on the wrong side of the law stealing cars, doing drugs, hanging out with gangs, I was even shot five times in the back, all because of a color of a bandana. This has shaped my identity as a student and the person I am today, giving me the strength and the will to be a survivor. (Good paragraph, Rita. I’m glad you added the part on how it shaped your identity – stay focused on this and avoid the temptation to just tell your story, even though it is an incredible one of overcoming obstacles.)
Another way my educational history has helped shape my identity as a student is going to prison. At first it was cool; I met better criminals, which eventually helped me to return back to prison. Only this time, I was doing a few years, and I sure did not want to be there, but I guess it’s exactly what I needed. I knew I wanted something different for myself, so I had to do some serious thinking. In prison I asked myself a few questions. Is this what my life is all about? Is this what I want? Is this who I am or who I want to be? No, it was not, (comma splice) I had to be real honest with myself. I asked myself,  “Where else is there better to start but right here?” It all started with me and my choices. I was scared to death, because I had to learn how to do things I never did before, and that was very frightening for me, (comma splice) change was frightening. I had a lot of changing to do within myself. I knew I needed to get a GED  so I took my next step and  that was to get myself into a class that would  help prepare me for the test.I had no idea what I was doing, I just knew I had to do something and this felt right. I wasn’t sure if I was strong enough to face the challenges and the struggles I knew were about to come. All I knew was that I wanted a different life. So I stayed and I studied very hard to learn and be able to pass my test. I took my GED test and I passed it, (comma splice) it was the best feeling I ever had. I could feel myself learning and I felt myself growing. I wanted more. (Excellent paragraph and very focused on your education in prison.)
 The most important thing that has helped shape me in to (into) the student I am today is my daughter Sosha, my son Kyle and my grandson Tyler Wallace Thiel, who is now eight months old,(end the sentence here).  I have been here in Marysville ever since he was born. I have now registered at  Yuba College,  first for the financial aid thinking it was going to be easy, but I was wrong. I sure was not prepared for becoming a college student.  I still have a lot of obstacles to overcome and challenges to face, while shaping my identity as a college student. My daughter and I have since gotten a three bedroom house together to start a new life. I still have a lot of goals I would like to reach. My first one is to continue my education here at Yuba College. (this is a fragment – remember to put a comma after college and then continue the sentence) so I may graduate and start working on a career. I have not decided what I want  to prepare for or study  , but I will soon.  My goal is to  get out of this class  everything it has to offer .I want to do the best I can to pass with confidence, so I will be ready for the next level of English. As for now I just want to keep learning. One of the things I have already learned in this class is what kind of mindset I have.
In the article“Brainology” by Carol Dweck,  she talks about a study that was done on students. . It was about two different mindsets, one a “fixed” mindset and the other a “growth"" mindset. As I read this article I found out that I had a “growth” mindset. This  means I’m a type of student who believes that everyone can improve their abilities and I also believe that intelligence is a potential that can be realized through learning and confronting challenges, profiting from mistakes, (comma splice) these are some ways of getting smarter” ( 2) Having a growth mindset pushes me toward reaching my goals until I get them.
 	We also read about “When Capable Students Fail” by Katie Hern.  No page until you actually use something from the article. I definitely can relate to this, (give me an example how you relate to something in that article) because I am still facing difficulties that come with becoming a college student. With all the insecurities I already have, because I feel stupid with the other students being freshly out of high school. I avoid participating in raising my hand to ask questions because I believed the others would think I was stupid. (Maybe you could add a quote or a paraphrase from the place in the article when Katie describes one of the four ways students self-sabotage in college. One of the ways was not asking for help.)
My husband use to say the only stupid question is one not asked. It made me wonder what he really meant by that, but today I understand exactly what he meant. I still have obstacles and setbacks that I face as a college student. I hope to overcome the fear I have of feeling stupid when I have to ask a question in class. I will overcome this by just asking and remembering what my husband would say about there is never a dumb question other than one not asked. Insecurities are a little harder to overcome because they are a result of  low self-esteem and no confidence in myself. When I first became a student here at Yuba College I had no confidence in myself, but after the first semester  doing well it has given me the belief in myself. Every day I feel myself grow in ways I didn’t think I could. So by keeping the faith and believing in myself I will overcome my insecurities. 
In conclusion, this is how my educational history has greatly shaped my identity as a student. Without the life struggles and my experiences i have been through i may not have become a college student now. most people do not realize without a education you can not become who we were meant to be.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_18q1b5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/18q1b5/if_you_read_youll_see_there_are_comment_in_the/,

1360812321.0,3,self.Proofreading,18hopp,Gun Control ,KushBoy420,3,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/18hopp/gun_control/,"In 2012 there were a total of 14 mass shootings that took place in the United States alone. That is a very large number in comparison to previous years. Some say that this is a ploy from government to get citizens to stray away from their constitutional rights. Others stand strong by their constitutions and continue to practice the right to bear arms. Most recent of these public horror incidences was the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. In this awful and horrible occurrence twenty-seven people, including eighteen children were shot to death in a unnecessary battle. This brought the death toll of the nation to eighty-four for the year in total. Due the rise in public shootings and massacres in the United States in the past year, many people push to remove assault weapons from the retail shelves completely. However, I believe it is a basis in our constitution to bear arms and should be reserved, with restrictions. Gun safety, or how to properly deal with and treat guns, should be a class taken by high-schoolers in a class room just as math or science.
	With over 14 mass-shooting this year alone, there is no question. Something needs to be done. Its people’s different theories about what needs to happen causing conflict in today’s society. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a democrat from California, says, “I can tell you that [Obama] is going to have a bill to lead on, because it’s a first day bill I’m going to introduce in the Senate, and the same bill will be introduced in the House – a bill to ban assault weapons. It will ban the sale, the transfer, the importation and the possession, not retroactively, but prospectively. And it will ban the same for big clips, drums or strips with more than ten bullets.” This statement and (if) action is an extremely radical proposal on one side of the issue. She wants to get rid of assault rifles all together. There is just one miniscule detail that the senator left out. This is the fact that criminals who are using these guns for illegal purposes don’t care if it’s illegal to possess them. Someone with a mind-set to kill hardly has a care about a silly gun law. In fact in 1994 a ban was issued on assault weapons with little results.
	George Will of the Washington Post wrote, “In 1996, a man went into a gym class in Scotland, killed 16 5- and 6-year-olds and the teacher. A few years ago in Norway, a young — deranged young man killed, what, 69 people on an island, mostly teenagers. Connecticut has among the toughest gun laws in this country. Didn’t help. Scotland and Norway have very tough gun laws. Didn’t help. So… We did — remember, we did — we did have a ban — we did have a ban on assault weapons. When we put the ban in place, these incidents did not really decline in a measurable way. And when we took it off, they didn’t increase in a measurable way.” That being said, banning these weapons wont put a dent in the numbers, that is clear. But what should be done? Lets look at the facts. 88 people we’re killed in mass shootings this year in the US alone, of the fourteen shootings that took place (in the United States), only four of those were done with assault weapons. How would banning assault weapons stop the other ten incidences from happening in the future? It not the assault weapon’s law that needs to change. Rather, the attitudes of people who handle these guns. Attitudes toward certain things develop over time, beginning in a person’s child-hood and how they are brought up. Celebrity, actor and music artist Jaime Foxx says, “We cannot turn our back and say that violence in films or anything that we do doesn’t have a sort of influence. It does.” This is true especially when the people committing these violent acts are often portrayed as heroes in a glorious light. There needs to be proper education and possibly a change in the media so that not every situation needs to end in a violent shoot out.
Some may feel that the only way to stop a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun. After the Sandy Hook tragedy, Texas Republican Louie Gohmert aggressively states, “I wish to God (the principal) had had an M4 in her office, locked up, so when she heard gunfire she pulls it out … and takes him out, takes his head off before he can kill those precious kids.” Particularly enough, a lot of people agree with Gohmert. Some activists push for added assault weapons, more as a defense mechanism from the extremists. As wild as Louie’s statement may seem this is a better solution as an alternative to Dianne Feinstein said earlier. A criminal with a mind set to kill has no regard for a gun law so miniscule compared to the law that he or she will be breaking killing any number of innocent people.
In my past experience my mother was never one to let any of my brothers or I play with guns. We weren’t even aloud to have them in the house. With that being said, I now being the age I am no nothing of guns. Nothing, other than you add a bullet and shoot. This lack of knowledge could be a good thing but if more people were accustomed to having guns around regularly, those people would know the dangers and understand the precautions of having guns. You may think that not knowing anything about guns is a good thing but if somebody like me, with little gun knowledge were to become angry enough they could essentially have access to guns just as easily as someone whose parents have guns. 
As far as gun control goes, our society needs to make a change in media and education according to guns. There has been over 14 mass shootings this year. Only four of those shootings were done with an assault weapon. This tells us that the ban of the assault weapons will not stop anything. The nation needs to stop portraying heroes with guns and killing and start educating children in school about the dangers associated with guns. Kids need to know what can happen if they use arms in retaliation and they will stay away from that.

1360031947.0,4,self.Proofreading,17wpos,[Request] I am doing an essay for an internship and I would like to have some feedback on it.,hispanica316,5,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/17wpos/request_i_am_doing_an_essay_for_an_internship_and/,"These are the questions I have to answer.

What is your personal motivation to apply for the HACU National Internship Program?

What are your academic and/or career goals?

What skills can you bring to an employer and what skills would you like to focus on throughout the internship?

My personal motivations to apply for this internship program include:

• Get professional experience in the fields that I am majoring in (accounting and finance). In this world’s competitive market having experience in my field of study with a very good company before I graduate would make me more appealing to potential employers and put me one step ahead of the competition, therefore increasing the changes that I get to choose which company to work for rather than being pressured on me by lack of opportunities.

• Test how I would cope with being away from my family. Being from a Mexican family where family is pretty much the most important thing, I want to try out for the first time what my mom calls “volar del nido” (to fly away from the nest), and be able to experience firsthand what it is like to live by myself with all the challenges that brings.

• I set a goal for myself to get an internship in 2013 with HACU so that I can get unique insights in my field of study and network with people from other parts of the world, so that I can expand my horizon and get to know how my country works a little better while doing so.

My career goal is to get my CPA and then work as an auditor or financial analyst in the FBI and be able to provide this agency the tools it needs to make its’ job easier and faster. I want to be able to catch people laundering money to contribute my grain of sand to this country which has given me so much. My academic goal is to graduate with a double major in accounting and finance with a concentration in financial analysis with a GPA &gt;3.00 and after that get my CPA certification.

I bring employers a different perspective into problems, which has been shaped by living in a house with a dual culture and being able to see the differences between one another. Other skill I bring to employers is good customer service, that I learned during the two years that I worked in the restaurant industry, where I also learned that being bilingual (like myself) is particularly important and useful specially living in a border town like I do.

During my internship I would like to focus on leadership skills, so that I can easily motivate other people as well as myself. I want to develop critical thinking, or as some people call it the “entrepreneur mind” which is the ability to see one step ahead than other people normally would and make decisions about it earlier and that way stay ahead of the competition. I want to learn how the software my company uses works so that I can troubleshoot problems and provide the clients my company has a superior customer service and support. I want to be able to acquire the skills needed to leave the company that I’m doing my internship with, better than when I first arrived there.

Background is: We are a group of people following Udacity's (www.udacity.com/) free online course on ""How to build a startup"" and had the idea of such a dedicated site. Initial idea is for academic writing (thesis, research papers, maybe slides) but maybe we should broaden? 

Would be a social enterprise; and not only for spelling/grammar/style checking but also in-depth content review (if requested by the author), checking equations etc.

People would first have to do a review of someone else's paper before receiving their own review. So that's another question: Would you (the submitters here) have been happy to do such a deal?

A dedicated site could offer more confidentiality (reviewers to agree to non-disclosure agreement before seeing paper), potentially better matching of papers to reviewers (by tagging papers, and users stating their expertise), and direct support for uploading original documents and those with edits/comments.

Any thoughts on the above (our current model) or arguments for a different one?

I chose ""Evaluate a significant experience, achievement, risk you have taken, or ethical dilemma you have faced and its impact on you.""

  ""He is not going to do it. Why would he? He is just a little girl."" With a large grimace forming across his face, my older brother uttered this declaration towards my other siblings. There I was, standing before a forty-foot cliff that dropped to the rest of the glimmering Lake Mead, when my brother made such a condescending statement. Looking down the rocky edge I could see waves of water lightly dancing across the edge of the menacing wall of rock. His condescending smirk was all the motivation I needed to challenge his assertion. It was an instantaneous decision. I retraced my steps and immediately bolted towards the edge, gaining momentum as my feet grasped every pebble with each step. Just as I was about to jump off , everything froze. 
          For most of my life, I have been conditioned to believe that I was born with a mental disease. So to compensate, I have done my best to impress my family. To my parents, I was the perfect son. Little did they know that with every compliment they gave, the more unstable I became inside. Every praise was just another link to my chain of guilt that I hauled the moment I took on the persona of their ideal son. My condition worsened as I matured, or at least it became more apparent. My charades did not have the same effect as my older siblings were all the while more cognizant. Yet, they never directly offered any form of assistance; they were in denial. However, they did attempted to suppress it with what they believed was practical.
        ""Junior, if you ever turn out to be gay, I will personally kick the living crap out of you,"" declared one of my older sisters. The same sister that helped raise me, that I viewed as a second mom, that praised me for my accomplishments as small as learning to tie my shoes, was now threatening me as though I was complete stranger. All of my siblings threatened me the same manner as the years progressed. My parents did nothing to alleviate my distress. For the most part, they simply ignored all of the threats that I had received from my siblings. The insults intensified with age, but I eventually found a way to cope with it. I found a sense of direction. I realized that the best possible way to disprove all of their assertions (of me being mentally incompetent because of my sexuality) was not by hauling the chains of my past, but by seeking a higher level of education as how I truly feel comfortable: gay. 
            Now, my decision to jump off the cliff wasnít one necessarily based on rage. This jump was merely a step of breaking away from the chains of my past. I was finally liberated. As I floated in the lake, I turned to my astonished brother and I smiled.

Narrative

A sad looking teenage girl walks along a graveyard, she gets to a grave and kneels by it for a while. As she gets up to walk away, her surroundings suddenly become foggy and she is being followed by a ghostly figure of a man. In the fog there are images of the girl and the ghost happily together. The ghost follows her off screen with a quick cut to black, a crash effect is heard. The girl reappears on screen with the ghost, they are holding hands as they walk away towards a light. 

Project Proposal 

This project will be entirely filmed in green screen, with some pre--recorded stock footage of a graveyard rendered into the final product. I will also be creating mist effects in Adobe After Effects to go over the stock and green screen footage.  This film contains no dialogue, it contains a shortened MP3 of Bring Me The Horizons ‘Suicide Season’ to play in the background. I feel the lack of dialogue will help the audience understand and sympathize with the characters on screen, it will also keep the audience focused on the eerie environment. I’m aiming to make this film a minute long, I want to try and reinforce the characters emotions with close ups and having long cuts between each shot. The main message of the film is about depression and suicide, the girl is alone and as she walks away she can’t bare to let go of the past. She then commits suicide and joins her partner in death as they walk together towards the light happily.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,1356211070.0,,,True,t3_15al06,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/15al06/can_someone_please_proofread_my_short_digital/,

Editor’s Note

As the New Year dawns upon us, I feel it is the perfect time to launch ‘What’s On Nha Trang’. We want to present you with all of the wonderful things to see and do on your visit to our fine city; having felt for some time that Nha Trang has been in need of a regular magazine that is both informative and topical. We aim to strike a healthy balance between important tourism information and interesting articles, and as we move forward, we will strive to improve upon every issue. 

There are many changes happening in Nha Trang. The construction we see everywhere is giving the city a major facelift, and as the months go by, it becomes more contemporary and grand in scale. The rate of progress is rapid and relentless. However, while the city steps enthusiastically into modernity, its cultural persona remains visibly attached to the past. There is a noticeable dichotomy between this pursuit of advancement and the humble traditions and customs that make up the Vietnamese way of life. The swelling ranks of young adults are helping to power the economy along, while the older generation reminds us of the history, principles and cultural philosophy that permeate every aspect of life here. 

Often frenetic and bustling, sometimes peaceful and serene, welcome to Nha Trang- the little city framed on every side by spectacular rivers, mountains, islands and blue sea. Within this frame, the toil, industry and smiling faces of the city’s inhabitants prove to be a veritable microcosm of Vietnam itself- wholly conscious of its roots, while eagerly anticipating its new and improved future. 

Our featured article explores the rich culture Tet Festival (Vietnamese New Year). For the local population, Tet is a time to reflect upon the year that has passed while welcoming in the next. Its basic theme is a desire for everyone to achieve good luck and prosperity. With that in mind, from myself and everyone involved in What’s on Nha Trang, we wish you all a happy, lucky and prosperous 2013.

Violent movies and video game pose a negative impact on developing minds in young children. How children turn out to be is biased on how they were raised. Behavior is shaped by positive and negative reinforcement. Personality is not baised on genes, anyone, regardless of their nature can be trained to do anything. Therefore, the minds of children are very easily molded into what they grew up with.

 Most kids are introduced to violent movies and video games between the ages of 6-8. Parents see this as a great way to distract their kids for many hours so they can have some free time; This is ideal for for busy parents. Most of them don't realize anything is wrong with this until their kids become violent individuals as they mature. The minds of children are essentially like play-dough, they are easily molded but as they are left out they harden in that fixed shape. ""behavior is shaped by positive and negative reinforcement"" described B.F Skinner(1904-1990) who was a behavioral psychologist. He state that ""An action such as violence in video games has a consequence, leading to the increased probability showing up in individuals."" This means that if someone has a violent upbringing then they will be influenced to participate in violent actions. 

Most families see violence in video games and movies as mindless fun. Also they tend to purchase these items to give to their kids and promote the learning of these negative traits. Since kids see these graphic and violent images on TV they begin to think that it's okay to treat people like they do on TV. Robert Zajonc(1923-2008) a psychologist looked at the relationship between feeling and thought; led to his discovery of the ""mere exposure effect"". Zajonc stated that "" the repeated exposed to a stimulus breed familiarity with it. Familiarity brings about an attitude change towards a stimulus taking the form of preference or affection. This preference is emotional and forms on a subconscious level before the person is even aware of it"". Therefore with a negative stimulus it can change the attitude or personality of an individual and promoting negative actions.




Some studies indicate violent films and television do not increase a child's tendancy towards violence. Some studies even indicate that exposed to violence can actually decrease the amount of agression in children. This is known as the Catharsis effect. It suggests that some individuals can relate to the characters and release negative feelings thereby becoming less aggressive personally. Other psychologists view television as a form of education, and believe that, they serve as roll models for children, if they are positive characters. This subject is extremely controversial because some psychologists do no believe in this effect. Albert Bandura, a renowned psychologist for his studies in developmental psychology, stated that the environmental experiences combined with violent media increases the chances for more aggressive individuals; especially children. 


Violent video games and films often promote aggression in children. Therefore, the amount they use would require regulation or a healthier home environment to avoid an altered mental state. Children are essentially like play-dough and can be easily molded and shaped into any type of individual, moreover, their biggest influences, television and video games will greatly affect the people they will become.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_13dgvv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/13dgvv/can_somebody_please_edit_my_argumentative_essay/,

I am well aware that I should be doing this research myself, as I have been for the past week, but my main inquiry here is to brainstorm some good points to consider including within my paper that have to do with the contemporary portion of my paper.

I want to submit this tomorrow, so I would appreciate anybody willing to review it. Don't go easy, please give me your honest opinions.


Albert Einstein once said, “I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.” Einstein did not attribute his success to special abilities, but rather, to his curiosity of the universe. Although I do not claim to be as talented as Einstein was, I do share his need to understand how different systems work together.

My passion was born in sixth grade, when my father helped me build my first computer. I remember placing all the parts together and then bugging him for days to help me figure out what was wrong with it. At the time, the idea of owning my own computer excited me, but I quickly discovered that the journey was more exciting than the destination. I had enjoyed learning how the different components interacted with each other more than actually using it.

The same year, my uncle introduced me to HTML. I quickly picked up the basics and was able produce simple webpages similar to those plaguing the web in the 90’s. This gave me a fundamental background and molded my thinking when learning new programming languages.

In December of 2011, I graduated ASU with a B.S. in Civil Engineering and a minor in Mathematics. My favorite assignments required using MatLab programming or designing complicated Excel spreadsheets. The class that influenced me most was taught by Dr. Braden Allenby, Earth Systems Management and Engineering. His main topics of discussion were about future technology and how they may impact human culture. He assigned a ten page paper on the topic of our choice, and I chose human enhancement by emerging technologies, such as the NBIC technologies (Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, Information Technology and Cognitive Science). While researching and writing the essay, I realized this is where my passion lies; this is what I want to do. From then I decided that I would pursue a graduate degree dealing with computers.

After graduating from Civil Engineering, I started planning my route to earn the graduate degree. I spoke to a few advisors, and they informed me of the new Computer Engineering program being offered. Next, I went online to find more information on the available courses. I looked at the courses that interested me, and found their prerequisites. There were a few classes that I would require, and am starting these in the fall semester.

Next, I decided to prepare myself by learning all I could about how computers work. I realized the A+ Certification had a section devoted to computer hardware and another to troubleshooting. Since I already had experience troubleshooting, and wanted to learn about the hardware, I decided to pursue the certification. After studying for two months, I was able to pass the tests and became A+ Certified.

After I had learned all I could about the hardware, and since I had time before the semester started, I decided to learn some programming languages, starting with Java. This also allowed me to decrease the time I need for the undergraduate classes and start taking graduate classes in January.

As my final preparation, I plan on viewing online lectures offered by Stanford and MIT on subjects such as Artificial Intelligence and Computer Language Engineering.

While learning about the new degree program, I was excited to discover the various research opportunities offered by CIDSE. In particular, I am interested in Dr. Joohyung Lee’s work with computer systems and reasoning. I would like to learn more about the research and hopefully take part in it. Additionally, I would enjoy working with the Center for Cognitive and Ubiquitous Computing. It would allow me to pursue my passion as well as help others in need.

Just as Einstein was able to make new discoveries, I am able to actively prepare for the Master’s program because of my passion for learning how various systems interact with one another. I hope to be able to use what I gain from the program and take my curiosity to the next level, by helping discover new technology for the advancement of humanity.

Thank you.

The Time Machine
The book The Time Machine is written by Wells, H. G. This book is a fiction book. The books’ setting is in the 1800’s. The setting takes place Europe. The main character is called the Time Traveler. The others characters in the story are: The Medical Man, The Journalist, and Weena. The antagonists’ of the story are the Murlocks. They are the creatures from the future that live in the underworld. 
The main part of the story starts off with the Time Traveler going into the future with his time machine. His time machine goes very far into the future. When he lands on the ground again, he notices an army of creatures coming at him. The things he encounters are like humans, but very small. He learns a lot about these strange people by following them. He finds that the Human race has taken a huge downhill. Instead of the future race being super smart, the future people lack intelligence and are almost cavemen like. 
As the time traveler decides he wants to go back home, he cannot find his time machine. It had been taken by something. On his quest for the time machine, he discovers a new breed of creatures, the Murlocks. The Murlocks live in the underworld, they can only see at night, and they are carnivores. The time traveler finally figures out that the Murlocks took his time machine. When he finds the time machine, he is nearly torn apart by the Murlocks. At the last second he hops on his time machine and sends it into the future. 
On his journey home, he watches the world end, and then goes back to his time. He gets out of his time machine, eats dinner, and tells his story to his close friends. 
I do not recommend this book. It is very short and has a dry story. It is a little interesting but slow.

Any help with my essay would be appreciated. This is my 3rd draft. Thanks in advance

Essay Prompt: Describe your decision making process in choosing physical therapy as a career choice versus other health care careers

I knew I wanted to go into healthcare, but which profession? My entire immediate family is in the medical field, so I reached out to their co-workers to talk about their jobs. I considered everything from physician's assistant, to chiropractor, to pharmacist, or even physician. In the end, though, the field of physical therapy brought together all the qualities I was looking for in my career. It combines my love of teaching, my fascination with the study of movement, and my desire to help others overcome challenges. 

I first became interested in physical therapy as a profession after I started doing CrossFit. CrossFit is an exercise program that is based on workouts that consist of constantly varied, high intensity, functional movements, including Olympic lifts, sprints, bodyweight exercises, rowing, gymnastics training, and more. As I started practicing these diverse exercises, I realized that I was learning a lot about the complexities of human movement. I had some dysfunctional motor patterns that needed correcting in order to complete some of the exercises effectively. As I worked through these problems with trained exercise professionals, I started thinking back to what I had learned in previous anatomy courses about the body's form as it relates to function. I was fascinated with the realization that these small motor problems can often lead to major injuries. Moreover, I saw firsthand how these motor patterns can be retrained, leading to huge gains in stability, performance, and pain-free range of motion. Throughout my CrossFit experience, I jumped at the opportunity to impart the knowledge I had gained to a newcomer. Not only could I help improve their training, but also to prevent them from future injury. I was learning how to move properly, helping others learn to do the same, and loving it. I knew that teaching others how to improve themselves had to be a major part of my future career. 

Having come to this decision, I jumped at the opportunity to complete a 150 hour internship at an outpatient clinic. While I could not perform any treatment, I was able to observe many different types of patients, injuries, modalities, and styles of communication. I remember one patient who was unable to walk due to a traumatic hip injury. Not only was she injured physically, but also psychologically due to her loss of mobility, independence, and ability to work. This patient made a fantastic recovery by the end of my internship. A lot of credit goes to the patient for putting in the work, but I saw how her recovery was made possible by the coordination and skill of this team of professionals. There were definitely setbacks, but the physical therapist provided help and support when the patient struggled. When I think of the adversity I have faced in my life, I am forever grateful to those who provided aid and comfort I needed to overcome obstacles. The satisfaction of providing this service to patients is one of the major reasons I have chosen pursue the study of physical therapy. My internship experience reaffirmed my decision to pursue physical therapy

When I think of the qualities that I admire in a professional, the words accountable, responsible, compassionate, kind, knowledgeable, sociable, and patient come to mind. These traits are apparent with every physical therapist I have shadowed. I try to demonstrate these qualities through my actions. By volunteering since 2010 at an organization that sorts medical supplies for third world countries, I show kindness and responsibility. By volunteering to help hospice patients, I display compassion, sociability, and patience. By excelling in the classroom, I demonstrate knowledge and accountability. For these reasons, I believe my personal values, goals, and interests fit best with a career in physical therapy.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_xn01r,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/xn01r/physical_therapy_school_personal_statement/,

James Bryce defined medicine as “the only profession that labors incessantly to destroy the reason for its own existence.” Truthfully, my definition of medicine is less adorned and much less eloquent. I believe, the role of medicine can be summarized in 3 statements, the first two I learned from my mentor and the last from my mother: 1) prevent the acute from becoming chronic 2) avoid the chronic from becoming acute 3) be nice &amp; listen. Truly, there is more complexity to medicine, but it was that last statement that changed how I practiced. It did not take me long to realize that patients know more about their ailments than us as medical professionals. I found that listening helped me not only develop as a clinician but also improved my patient satisfaction and care. I believe listening brought me to today, to this decision. Honestly, I was not always certain Sleep Medicine was my ultimate goal. When I started my internal medicine residency, I was quickly drawn to pulmonary and critical care. At first, I was intrigued by the acuity of care and the life-or-death nature of the field. I felt I found my niche in medicine. Even though I was initially drawn to the critical care aspect of my fellowship I missed being able to sit down and talk to my patients. It was during pulmonary continuity clinic that I was able to reconnect with my patients and subsequently where had my initial exposure to sleep medicine. It was here that I first noticed how neglected and under diagnosed OSA can be. It seemed that by the time patients were reaching my clinic they had told at least a couple of providers, “Doc, I’m waking up tired, I’m out of breath, I have no energy.” Many of them undergoing multiple evaluations and diagnosed with a barrage of differentials, anything but OSA. It all came back to listening. I drew immense satisfaction from paying attention to my patient and being able to say, I think I can help you. I enjoyed when patients would come for follow up after treatment and they looked refreshed and improved. I believe that F. Scott Fitzgerald said it best, “The worst thing in the world is to try to sleep and not to."" I delve early on into this newfound interest and spent more time in sleep clinic and the sleep lab. The deeper I got, the more I was sure that my mind was made up. Sleep medicine has complimented my career choice and made my career more pleasurable and rewarding. Where ever this new step leads me, I plan to bring along my values and strive for the very best in patient care and satisfaction. I plan to listen to my patient and try to help them on a daily basis. I seek a program that will provide a healthy teaching environment between faculty and fellow. I look forward to a fellowship in Sleep Medicine with the hope of providing empathetic care, receiving academic support, and building life-long relationships with colleagues and patients.

Prompt:  
        In an essay, discuss the Constitutional Convention and explain how Dr.  Thomas Cronin’s seven qualities of leadership [Knowledge, Knowledge of  Oneself, Integrity, Sense of Priorities, Sense of Humor/Compassion,  Ability to Create and Resolve Conflict, Ability to be Creative and an  Entrepreneur] are reflected in the people that would initiate and  surround this event. Secondly, how did their decisions make their  communities more or less sustainable?

Essay:
       
In May of 1787, delegates from twelve of the thirteen states gathered in Philadelphia with the task of revising the Articles of Confederation. Though the Articles of Confederation had managed to keep the country in order for a few years, they were ultimately not a sustainable form of government because they left little room for amendment and left the federal government depending on the states for money. In addition to this, conflicts between the states began to arise after the Revolutionary War which the weak federal government could not solve adequately. It was clear to the delegates that the Articles needed some serious revision and early on in the convention they decided that it would be best to write a new constitution altogether.         
        James Madison of Virginia designed and wrote a plan for a new central government which came to be known as the “Virginia Plan”. Although it would be significantly modified, it was approved by the convention and then revised into what we know today as the Constitution, leading many to consider Madison the Father of the Constitution. His knowledge of government systems proved to be his greatest asset at the convention and is just one of Cronin’s qualities of leadership that he possessed. Though he was only twenty-six at the time of the Constitutional Convention, he had already gained knowledge through his various political experiences. Madison had been a delegate at the Virginia Convention, become a member of the Continental Congress, served on the Council of State in Virginia, and served in the Virginia House of Delegates twice. While in the Virginia state legislature, he became known as the protégé of Thomas Jefferson. Their friendship and scholarliness helped Madison further form his ideas about government. Through their sharing of ideas and books, Madison gained greater knowledge of government systems along with a variety of other subjects. This, along with his earlier studies, made him a knowledgeable leader at the Constitutional Convention.

Although the Virginia Plan was approved by the convention early on, several aspects created conflict amongst the delegates. In an effort to come to agreement, several were able to exercise their ability to resolve conflict, often in creative and innovative ways. One such conflict was about the states’ representation in the legislative branch. Madison’s Virginia Plan proposed representation based on population in the lower and upper houses. Though this idea was greatly approved of by larger states; smaller states felt this would leave their voices unheard and drowned out by the large states, they instead wanted equal representation. In response to the conflict, Roger Sherman stepped up and attempted to resolve it through a compromise. His proposal stated that the House of Representatives be based on population and that the Senate have equal representation from each state. Although his proposal would resolve the issue of representation, the convention rejected it. However, Sherman’s idea was not forgotten,  and he showed valuable leadership traits such as the ability to resolve conflict and the ability to be creative by coming up with a solution that had previously been unheard of.  Though it didn’t initially receive approval, his compromise proved to be useful to the convention later on.

The rejection of Sherman’s proposal led William Peterson to counter the Virginia Plan with the New Jersey Plan. Unlike the Virginia Plan, the New Jersey Plan proposed a unicameral legislature which would have equal representation from each state. This plan was ultimately rejected for various reasons including the fact that it would only amend the Articles of Confederation instead of writing a new constitution.  Thus the convention remained split on the idea of equal representation versus population based representation. 

Oliver Ellsworth soon led a motion which proposed equal representation in the upper house and popular representation in the lower house. The result of the proposal was a tie and a committee was formed to come up with a compromise. They were to find a solution to the issue about representation and if the country should be more national or more federal. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts was on the committee along with George Mason of Virginia and William Paterson of New Jersey. Gerry recognized that they needed “to put theoretical niceties to one side…and think about ‘accommodation’ ” (Lloyd). 

The Gerry Committee was urged to accept the compromise over representation but there were a few, including Gerry and Mason, who held out and wanted a wholly national legislature. They were in a peculiar situation, “neither the same Nation nor different Nations. If no compromise should take place,” Gerry asked “what will be the consequence?” (Lloyd). Although Gerry was originally a supporter of a wholly national system, he realized that the priority of the committee was to move forward and come to a decision, regardless if it was not exactly in accordance with his personal views. Mason also agreed that, “there must be some accommodation” (Lloyd). They agreed to accept a partially national, partially federal compromise if popular representation was agreed upon as necessary for taxation. Paterson pushed the Committee to agree to the terms of the compromise because there simply “was no other ground of accommodation” (Lloyd). The compromise, which became known as the Connecticut Compromise, was finally accepted thanks to the delegates’ sense of priorities.

The delegates’ decision to divide power amongst three separate branches of government and, on top of that, divide the legislative branch in two, created a system where each branch of government had limited power and where the assembly of a majority was difficult. Regardless of the fact that they had established a system of majority government, the Framers of the Constitution did not want assembly of the majority to be an easy task. They feared this would cause instability and consequently a system which was not sustainable. The Framers also realized that in order for the government to be stable and durable, there also needed to be some distance between the masses and the “levers of power”. Under the Constitution, the governing majority is made up of representatives of the people, not the combined capacity of the people themselves. This keeps the government from fluctuating as quickly as public opinion and helps assure {writers block}.

Another aspect of the Constitution which has proved to be an asset to its sustainability is the difficulty involved in making amendments. Since the time of its ratification, it has only been amended twenty-seven times, the first ten being the Bill of Rights, which was created immediately after the Constitution and was concurrent with it. The complexity of amendment makes the government less susceptible to rapidly changing times and ever-changing political theories and ideas. It asserts a certain level of concreteness, giving the public ease through the years that they can count on a sustainable system.

The delegates of the Constitutional Convention, though they were all leaders that had differing opinions and various beliefs of how the government should be set up, were able to create and come to agree upon the United States Constitution. The Constitution laid out the structure for a new government and became the supreme law of the land. Because of the leadership qualities the delegates possessed, most notably their in-depth knowledge, their sense of priorities and commitment, their innovative creativity, and their ability to resolve conflicts, they were able to design a constitution which has endured over two hundred years of war, political unrest, presidents and cabinets of many different parties, changing times and yet has remained a solid, almost completely unchanged block on which the country can rely.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_uaei0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/uaei0/alright_proofreaders_do_your_worst/,

1336353129.0,3,self.Proofreading,tahba,Can You Proofread My Discussion Project on the Book Frankenstein by Mary Shelley?,Skankalite,3,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/tahba/can_you_proofread_my_discussion_project_on_the/,"This is for an 11th grade English Class.  Specifically, I'm not sure if I used my ellipses right, but any proofreading would be greatly appreciated.  Here it is:

**Discussing the parent-child relationships present in the novel:**

One prevalent theme in the book Frankenstein by Mary Shelley is the theme of parental responsibility.  Shelley addresses this theme throughout the book by contrasting the manner in which Victor Frankenstein was raised and how Victor treated his own creation.  The idea that children are completely innocent and it is their parents’ duty to instill happiness within them is presented towards the beginning of the book.  Victor described himself as “their [Victor’s parents] child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven, […] whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery…” (Shelley 19).  Victor’s parents chose to bring happiness to Victor by loving him and showering him with compassion.  His parents’ actions contrast sharply with the way Victor treated his own creation.  Once created, Victor responded with immediate disgust and hatred.  He “… dreaded to behold this monster…” (Shelley 47).  This reaction caused Victor to run away in fear from his creation.

Shelley continues to develop the theme of parental responsibility when the true killer of Victor’s brother, William, is revealed to be the monster he created.  The monster admitted to killing William when Victor “for the first time […] felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, […] I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness” (Shelley 88-89).  The monster justified his murder as an act of revenge against his creator for not fulfilling his parental duties.  At the end of his tale, the monster asked Victor to create a female specimen like him to be his companion in life.  Victor, however, could not bare the thought of having two unnatural creations walking the earth because of him.  He vowed “… never will I create another like yourself [the monster], equal in deformity and wickedness“ (Shelley 157).  Consequentially, the monster killed those most dear to Victor, and essentially drove Victor to death.

Throughout the book, the monster showed that he knew the difference between what was morally right and wrong.  Once Victor finally died, the monster made an appearance and exclaimed, “That is also my victim! […] Oh, Frankenstein! […] What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me?  I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst.  Alas!  He is cold, he cannot answer me” (Shelley 209).  The feeling of remorse and need to be forgiven clearly shows that the monster was able to fathom the extremity of his misdeeds.  Thus, the question is raised:  how much blame should be placed on Victor and his monster?  Victor willingly chose to create his monster, but abandoned it and treated it with disdain and hatred, which could very well be the reason that the monster grew to be so cynical and hateful himself.  The monster started off innocent, as Shelley claimed all children do. This innocence is shown when the monster says, “I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the [moon].  I gazed with a kind of wonder…” (Shelley 91).  Only when society shunned him, as did his creator, is when the monster embarked down his vengeful and evil path.  Therefore, the monster was not inherently evil, but driven to commit evil deeds.  Indeed, a great deal of blame must be placed upon the monster, but had Victor been a good parent, both his and the monster’s life would probably have turned out differently.  Failing to fulfill his parental responsibility of providing love and happiness to his Victor’s creation is what led to both his and the monster’s demise, and the same fate for all parents is what Shelley tried to warn of in her novel Frankenstein.

**Discussing Victor’s “ethical dilemma” regarding the promise he made to his creature:**

Mary Shelley used Victor Frankenstein to address the philosophical and ethical debate between consequentialism and non-consequentialism in her novel Frankenstein.  In the novel, Victor created a monster, but neglected it until one day the monster confronted Victor with his story and asserted “You must create a female for me with whom I can live…” (Shelley 134).  Victor reluctantly agreed and began the process of spawning another unnatural creature.  It is at this point that Victor began to question the ethics of creating another monster like the one he had already made.  The side of consequentialism is represented when Victor wonders about the outcome that making a female monster could entail.  If the female rejected the monster, the monster could go on another vengeful rampage.  Also, if the two had children, Victor would be responsible for a new race of unnatural beings walking the earth.  The opposing argument is the side of non-consequentialism, which claims that an action is either right or wrong in and of itself, regardless of the outcome.  It is unlikely that, even if Victor followed non-consequentialism, would consider creating a female monster morally right, since Victor considered his monster “… a demon whose delight is in death and wretchedness…” (Shelley 157).  Therefore, it is not surprising that Victor decided against creating a female companion for his creation.  This decision sparked a vengeful rage within the monster and eventually led to the death of those closest to Victor, Victor, and the monster himself.  This could be evidence that Mary Shelley believed in non-consequentialism because if Victor had made the supposedly morally right decision, it is possible that this death and sorrow would have been avoided.  However, that reasoning could also mean that Shelley followed consequentialism because the end result is what determined what was morally right or wrong in the end.  Although, she could have also been trying to convey the difficulty in subscribing entirely to either way of thinking completely.  It is hard to decide what answer, if any (perhaps she was just raising the question), Shelley was trying to give.  No matter what, though, it definitely highlights the philosophical conflict that people can have within their own minds.

&gt;The dark, damp soil dredges its way into the underside of your soles while they step ever so lightly over the carpet of brittle branches covering the forest floor. The slender shadows slip in and out of sight through the tall, never-moving trees instilling an ominous, eerie feeling in the very core of one’s body. The fleeting moment, during which your racing heart beats faster and faster as if trying to rip free of its pinfold. The moment when you feel a piercing cold grab onto your shoulder creating a split second of sheer terror as your heart sinks. The moment when you realize that it’s over.
&gt;
&gt;“Got ya!” He laughed breathlessly. 
&gt;
&gt;I was too over exhausted to argue. Though it didn’t matter because it seemed as if I was the last one left, which was exceptionally rare. It seemed like scarcely any time had passed since the cockcrow, and yet, the umbrage stated otherwise. As we began the journey home the other players had caught up to us on our way back, joining in the array of laughter, and boasting of their great feats of cunning and furtiveness. Looking back on it, it did not matter if I had won or lost, but at that moment, the triumph had tasted as sweet as anything I’d ever tasted. Soon thereafter, the pulsating rings of the dinner bells had split our group apart for the time being. I rushed off home, feeling content about the way the day had gone.
&gt;
&gt;As I was walking up the creaking cedar porch, I noticed my mother, sitting in the Adirondack chair, with tears swelling in her blue eyes. She had been fine just this morning; there had to have been a letter. She brought me inside the familiar cottage house, with the single buzzing light bulb suspended in the middle of the room. The floorboards let out a creak with every step, as if warning us as to what’s about to happen. At the end of the room, my brother was seated on the opposite side of the table. The next ten minutes had been near stagnant. Each second had crept behind the other as the methodically slow clock ticked away. The seemingly never-ending moment had concluded with words that had beaten all breath out of me.
&gt;
&gt;“We’re moving to Canada.”
&gt;
&gt;The words echoed in my head, over and over again. Abashed, and in disbelief I helplessly reached out for words to put together a sentence. I was speechless. The news had come as sudden and as painful as an arrow piercing the shell of a person I had been at that moment. For a split second, I felt the void that had been filled by friends and family. How was I to accept that this time I spent with my friends would be the last? How was I to understand the reason behind being ripped out of my life? 
&gt;
&gt;The next day we were gone. As we were riding the train back to our small, cramped apartment in the city, I gazed out the window to see the life I had grown to love pass before my eyes. The rolling hills of green grass, fresh with morning dew, and the roaming cattle dispersed upon a pasture stretching out to the horizon, touching the rising sun.  Amidst the fields of grain were woods teeming with wildlife; the very essence of nature itself. It all slowly began fading into a memory. 
&gt;
&gt;Boarding off the train onto the slatternly, crammed platform, I was led through the amassed crowd into a run-down taxi cab to take us to my only remaining home. After the arrival to our tiny apartment, I ran outside. I did not know why I was running, or where.  Sprinting in between a rundown alley created by the adjacent building I crashed into a garbage can, plummeting to the ground. The hard cracked pavement had provided no cushion to soften the fall. Skin slid against the sandpaper like pavement creating an abrasion from elbow to fingertip. The exposed aching flesh needed tending, so defeated, I went home. 
&gt;
&gt;The next two days were spent abed in a small crevice within the cramped apartment. My brother and I watched as pieces of our lives were either packed up or thrown away. With no choice in the matter, I helplessly watched as my life was being torn apart. The etchings in the wall that had shown my height since the day I could walk were painted over while I was forced to throw out every possession that I had acquired. By the end of the week, it was no longer our home; it was an empty desolate place that belonged to a stranger. It was time to leave.
&gt;
&gt;On our last day, our family and friends had gathered up to wish us farewell. Gazing out onto the airport walkway I did not know what awaited us, though I knew what I was leaving behind. We were abandoning our family, our friendships, and our home. We were leaving our life to begin again in a faraway country. As the tears ran down the faces of the ones we loved, we said our farewells. At that moment, I realized that it was over. It was time to start anew.

Preservice Teachers Learning” by Margaret Schmidt

(name)

(institution)


     In this article, Schmidt walks us through a qualitative phenomenological study of learning experiences

offered at the undergraduate level and their value to those experiencing them. The purpose of this study is to

explore the value of coursework and field experience in the eyes of multiple undergraduate students and how

these opinions relate to John Dewey's theory of experience. The research in this study focused on three main

research questions: “During their undergraduate program, what did six preservice teachers claim to learn from

their teaching experiences in a variety of settings? What aspects of these teaching experiences seemed most

valuable to them? Does Dewey’s theory of experience provide a meaningful framework for interpreting the value

they placed on their teaching experiences?” (Schmidt 2010)

     Six instrumental education majors were researched over two years, starting at the year of their practicum

courses. Students were observed through video, written assessment, instructor assessment, seminars, and a

personal interview. Upon completion of the gathering of data, the information was refined and categorized

based on key topics touched on by each subject. This data was then constructed into a response designed to

reflect the students' opinions in their own point of view. Students were then able to offer suggestions to make

the data as accurate as possible.

     Students reported many ideas from their undergraduate experience that they learned and then assigned

value. Four main experiences proved most valuable to the group of subjects: peer teaching exercises,

university-mandated field experience, Student teaching, and self-arranged teaching experiences such as private

lessons and being an aid to local groups. (Schmidt, 2010) These reported experiences had a moderate

connection to Dewey's theory of experience.

     Dewey's theory accurately represented the opinions of these students and were readily observed under his

central points of continuity, interaction, and community. Students' learning through peer teaching and lesson

plan writing was exemplary of interaction in Dewey's theory. The students learned about different learning

methods and how interaction can affect how a student learns from classroom experiences. The subjects

demonstrated continuity in learning in the way that they related present experience to those that they already

had, creating a line of association that furthers their knowledge in a building manner. Community played an

important role in the students' learning by allowing them to safely learn through experimentation and trial and

error methods.

     Although students value further field experience for teacher preparation, they also benefit greatly from a safe

classroom community setting to facilitate formation of ideas and supplement growth as an educator. Interaction

with their peers also proved to be valuable to these subjects, not just interaction with their students. These

subjects showed that coursework is also a highly important aspect of teacher preparation.

     Some aspects of this study raise questions about accuracy and obtaining useful information. The first

problem about the data is that it was mostly collected before the subjects graduated. To truly gauge the

students' opinions about value in their undergraduate experience, one would think that the students would be

interviewed several years down the road to see how applicable each type of experience was. This premature

conclusion of study significantly weakens the information in this article. Another issue with this research is the

fact that the researcher was actively involved with the students from day to day as an instructor. When a study is

being performed, a degree of separation and commitment to being impartial is important to reporting accurate

information to your audience. It seems unlikely that an instructor could stay purely impartial in study when

dealing with his students on the very topics he is attempting to gain incite into. The final issue is the fact that all

students in the study are from the same institution. Plurality could strengthen his point about the importance of

coursework if several university programs were a part of the study.

My current background, in regards to this research project, would involve my extensive education that I have acquired during my university career in psychology and neuroscience.  Due to my enrolment within the college of biological science, I have been taught by experts in many different fields, from psychology to molecular biology.  This large variation in subjects allows me to analyze and review research from many different perspectives within science. By experiencing and actively learning about a subject from enthusiastic experts in their related fields, I too was motivated to find an area that I was extremely interested in, which turned out to be behavioural neuroscience.  As I began to specialize into my areas of interest during 4th semester, my grades have improved drastically, which has placed me in standing with the Dean's honours list.  

Through my experience from taking behavioural neuroscience, and through literature review, I have become familiar with several of the procedures, and background information, that will be used to guide this proposed research, such as the various surgical techniques, and the conditioning of the animals to self-administer heroin.  This area of research, in regards to drug addiction and relapse, is of high interest for me, as the results within this study will have a direct impact on the direction of future research, and may possibly have a large impact on the future of treatment for those dealing with drug addiction.  When I took introduction to psychology, I was immediately fascinated by the profound impact that research in psychology has on the population, and this research reinforces the fascination of real-world research application that I have.  In the future, during my undergraduate or graduate theses, my interest would lie on the effects of various psychoactive drugs on the central nervous system of human and animal models, and by taking part in this research, with guidance from an expert, I will acquire substantial  experience that will help me reach my personal goals in academics and research.

This is the first draft, and I'll use any advice/corrections given when I do the second one!

EDIT: Second draft
&gt;There have been times where I have felt like my life and future were shackled to my health and my mother's drug habits. I would picture these bindings as thick and heavy, holding me back from a future I deserved and could easily achieve. It took me a long time to unlock these mental restraints, and I feel I am the better for it; I emerged from the bondage stronger from carrying that weight for years, and motivated to make up for lost time. This period left its mark on me, and formed the foundation of my desire to go to college: I want to be everything I can be.

&gt;I was always a bookish child, fond of accounts of famous scientists. From early on, I was drawn to zoology and biology in general. I devoured Jane Goodall and Mark Owen's books about African wildlife. When I watched television, it was Animal Planet or Discovery. I aspired to be a Stephen Irwin or Charles Darwin. I wanted to travel the world, discover new animals, and protect them from the encroaches of humanity on their habitats. When I learned I had to live with pain that could keep me curled in a ball on a good day, those dreams felt dashed. How could I ever spend weeks away from humanity doing research when I was like that?

&gt;There should be a word to describe the feeling of waiting in a doctor's office to learn what is wrong with you. When I was twelve, I had experienced extreme pain in my side. An X-Ray and a sonogram later, I learned that one of my kidneys was far too large; An eighteen centimeter cyst had grown in it, and was growing larger. This lead to a simple operation to drain it, which should have eliminated the pain. It never stopped, and the cyst grew back within weeks. There were a few more operations after that one, each as ineffective as the last, while becoming increasingly invasive. Eventually, the doctors  decided to leave it be. I was to live with a constant ache.

&gt;Lives are crushed by drug abuse, and my mother's was no exception. The memory of the first night I found her completely out of touch with reality will stay with me forever. I was fifteen on that day, and sought her out for something or other. She was sprawled on her bed, and completely unresponsive to me. I panicked, and immediately called my aunt who came to get us. Later, when she was sober, she lied about having a bad reaction to a new medication and promised that it would never happen again. In my naivete I believed every word. Nights like that would become increasingly common, nearly a daily occurrence at some points. I stopped calling relatives when it happened, and lied about it when they asked me how she had been.

&gt;These two issues left me feeling like I had no hope or future. I was an invalid most of the time and my mother was a drug-addict who had lost her job- What could I ever amount to? I sank into a deep depression I am still recovering from. I lost most of my friends, and shut myself into my room.   Whenever I started to feel better, my mother would have a particularly bad episode or my kidney would leave me in the fetal position. At the worst of it, I was contemplating suicide. This went on for nearly two years.

&gt;I remember waking up one day feeling sick of being depressed. It was almost like the self-hatred about every aspect of myself had targeted itself. I didn't truly care why I felt that way. Instead, I latched onto that feeling and used it to fuel my attempts to break my unhappiness. I felt like I had a future for the first time in what seemed to be forever. Spurred by my new hope, I carefully examined myself so I could discard the aspects that held me back. During this reinvention of myself, I realized I had lost years of time to nothing. I had fallen severely out of shape and behind on my studies. The next morning, I began an exercise and study regiment, and changed my diet for the better.

&gt;I can see a future for myself now. The pain I live with isn't going to hold me back from being the zoologist I want to be, nor will my mother. Going to college will not only provide me with the education I need for this goal, but it will challenge me to be better than I could without it. I want that challenge, I want to apply myself to my limits to make up for the time I've lost. I hope that in doing so, I can distinguish myself enough to do the research I have always dreamed of. Dowling's Higher Education Opportunity Program states that its purpose is to “enable students to hurdle the academic and financial barriers facing them.“ I feel that I qualify in both these regards.

Essay- The essay prompts below are designed to allow you to share more about yourself. We want a glimpse of what matters to you. And remember, the application essay is an opportunity for you to move beyond test scores and grades. Avoid platitudes and checklists of accomplishments and activities. The more specific you can be about your personal experience, the better.
Write a well-developed essay (600 word maximum) on ONE of the following:
 
**Discover: Tell us about an intellectual challenge that has mattered to you – something that you have wrestled with and explored independently. How have you resolved it, and what impact has this had on your plans for the future?
**

Create: Select a creative work that has changed your worldview and your view of yourself.  This work could be your own, or a novel, film, formula, poem, musical piece, sculpture, building or other creative work that has inspired you to take action. Discuss the work and its effect on you.

Serve: Describe your most significant involvement with service to date. Tell us about a single effort that you have taken to address hunger, literacy, diversity, sustainability or any other issue that matters to you.  We want to know how you have made a lasting impact in an original way. Be sure to include a discussion of how your service work has affected your plans for the future.

_____________________________________

I think undoubtedly the question of life is “What is the meaning of life?” The answers to this question may vary from a scientific standpoint (i.e. “We are all just a beautiful set of mistakes that developed over time”) to a more religious point of view (i.e. “To get to heaven”), but no one person can answer this question as a fact. This is why millions of people flock to their own religious corners and take up arms against people who aren’t really that different than they are.

I, myself, was raised as a Roman Catholic. I went to mass every Sunday and received my first communion with every other kid in my Sunday class. But, me being the idealistic kid that I am ( as my parents would say, “ornery”), I would show up on Sundays with questions like “What is faith?” and “How could Noah have possibly fit 2 of every animal on his boat?”. Needless to say, the elderly folks who taught Sunday school weren’t used to a husky little 3rd grade boy asking them questions that they had struggled to answer their whole lives. I would always get different answers that were really just cop outs because they didn’t know what else to tell a kid my age.

Even though I was questioning religion at every step, I still considered myself Catholic because that is what a school age kid does, in the “Bible Belt”. I never stopped asking the questions that came to my mind and they only started to get deeper and deeper. 

It wasn’t until my freshman year in high school that I started to become vocal to my peers about questioning religion. I soon found others who were like me and we would often hold semi-organized debates about religion and the meaning of life. I soon came to the conclusion that there really was no meaning of life and that we were simply here to be here and nothing really mattered. Some would call this depression (I was on Accutane at the time so this is completely feasible), but the proper term would be an “agnostic-nihilist”.

It soon came time to look into options for my future, because apparently staying in high school for the rest of my life was not an option. I started to look at the things that interest me and things that interest others around me. I realized that I was really interested in business and the stock market. I started to hang out with a wider variety of people and I opened my mind up to new ideas. I developed the mindset of “Carpe Diem” and I soon realized that life isn’t useless. Life is about becoming the most successful you can be, whether it is a baseball player, car mechanic or an entrepreneur.

I would still classify part of myself as a catholic but only in the way that I treat people and not the way that man has came to be where he is today. I am an 18 year old agnostic that treats people well and is trying his hardest to be the best person that he can be.

That is why I am going on my way—not to seek another doctrine, for I know there is none, but to leave all doctrines and all teachers and to reach my goal alone—or die.”

I am an atheist who went to Catholic school for 8 years. While I am sure that religious schools have churned out many atheists, my school didn’t surround me with others like myself. I was an outright minority, and it was that experience that allowed me to grow in the face of controversy.
I first developed my beliefs after reading Siddhartha the summer before I went to high school. In the book, you see Siddhartha’s journey towards enlightenment, during which he rejects several other paths to find his own way. I thought to myself, ‘how is it that so many people in the world can have different religions, and yet each still claims it is the right one?’ This makes several assumptions about God and the development of religion in general, but I eventually came to the following conclusion: God is not man’s creator; religion is a universally human trait that, in a long enough timeline, every society will develop.  

My realization had left me alone, both spiritually and socially, yet I couldn’t see any other way. At the time of my discovery, I was a fighter. In my religion classes, I would argue vehemently with the teachers and other students. Outside class, people wouldn’t take my arguments seriously; I was just a godless heathen. I began to argue so strongly that others would simply dismiss me, assuming I was merely a contrarian, prone to disagree with whatever they thought. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for discussion. 

In college, I was no longer in that heavily spiritualized environment, and yet I found some people who were still heavily spiritual. However, these weren’t strangers anymore. The only way for me to discover people’s religious beliefs was to become good enough friends with them that it didn’t matter anymore. I no longer wanted to fight; I was tempered into a semi-rational adult. When I talked about religion, it was no longer with the need to convince them of my beliefs. Instead, it was a true discussion, an attempt to discover more about the other person and grow with them. My argumentative nature in high school was merely my attempt to grow ‘at’ people, instead of with them. It’s this important distinction that would make me a good lawyer. 

I have no problem thinking on my toes in a heated debate; I can argue circles around the best of them. More importantly, I don’t have to. I have grown to recognize the worth of other people’s viewpoints, and it was a lesson I had to learn on my own. I want to take that guiding principle with me, both to law school and beyond, and defend those viewpoints. I want to be an integral member of society, one that holds up the infrastructure that has been established and allows people to come together and truly discuss.

Monster
	Josephine was asleep in her bed.  It was three in the morning when the first noise came; a thud as the front door was thrown open into the wall.  She imagined the already plastered dent deepening and didn’t move.  She knew if she did it would only make the night worse for her.
	She heard fast words traded between a man and a woman.  The hushed tones reminded her of wind whipping around before a storm.  The storm was brewing downstairs and any minute it would break.  She heard one word shouted above the others.
	“Drunk!”
	The sound of her mother’s body falling followed.  The poor woman always ended up in the same situation after provoking the Monster.  Josephine started to cry controlled, quiet sobs.  ‘Why does she always make the same mistakes?’ she wondered as the tears slid down her cheeks.
	The stairs creaked and Josephine’s body stiffened under the covers.  The Monster was coming and there was no way out.  She was trapped in the dark with the monster chasing her and he knew all of her favorite hiding spots.  Josephine looked asleep, but her mind was screaming at her and her heart pounded, trying to break out and escape, unlike the foolish girl lying in her bed.
	The door creaked open, moving slowly and making the suspense worse.  The nightgown stuck to her back from a cold sweat and a chill crept its way up and down her spine.  ‘Why couldn’t he just throw the door open like he did with every other door?’ she wondered frantically.  ‘Why does he always go so slowly?’
	This was his favorite part of the night, and Josephine knew it.  The Monster enjoyed her fear.  He enjoyed it more than drinking.  Like an animal, he could smell the fear in the room.  It surrounded and choked Josephine, but he inhaled it and used it as fuel.  
	She imagined him standing in the doorway with a grin creeping over his hideous, drunken face and a scheme in his mind.  He licked his lips as he tasted her fear, a delightfully cold sensation that filled the small bedroom.  The monstrous form blocked the hallway light, darkening his face.  He was a shadow straight from her nightmares, thumbing through her fears patiently as if looking through a restaurant menu.  Each time he chose a different fear as a way to approach the young girl.  
	
Josephine remembered one of her first nights in the house with its Monster.  In the beginning the Monster had seemed so kind, welcoming Josephine into the family.
	“Foster families are scary sometimes, huh?” he said putting his hands on her frail ten-year-old shoulders.  Josephine looked up at him with big eyes.  Her life was a continuing story of upheaval; this was the second foster family she had been assigned to.
Josephine had never known her real mother.  The landlord found her after knocking the door down to their apartment.  Her mother lay dead and bloody on the bathroom floor with the bath water running, and Josephine remained untouched and wailing in her clumsy wooden crib.  Their small apartment had been torn apart, missing anything of value.
Immediately after, Josephine had a wonderful ten year stay with the Crandall family.  It was an ideal life with great parents and a fantastic older brother.
One day, however, Mr. and Mrs. Crandall were driving their oldest son Henry back from college at the end of the semester of his freshman year.  Josephine had been left with a babysitter because there was not enough room for all of Henry’s things in their tiny Accord.  The car and Henry’s things were found scattered along the highway later that afternoon.
	“Don’t worry, kiddo,” the Monster joked.  “We won’t bite!”
	After so much misfortune, Josephine developed an overall distrust of comfort.  Life had so far taught her to not become attached or feel happiness because it never lasts.  This new family in her mind was just a temporary detour before the next bad thing happened to her.
	Josephine stood in the rain with the Monster as he gathered her bags and started to carry them to the house.  The cold drops splashed onto her cheeks and matted her bangs to her forehead.  She clutched her arms to keep warm and followed him into the house.

	The Monster had chosen a way to approach her and the floorboards creaked under his heavy boots.  It became harder for Josephine to contain her shaking, but remaining still was crucial; she did not want the Monster to know how much he scared her.  She heard and thought nothing, only concentrating on maintaining her breathing to distract her from the Monster that nearly loomed above.

	She had met her timid new mother who made the girl a bowl of chicken noodle soup after getting in from the rain, talking absentmindedly with her about the past.  Josephine took pity on her shaking hands pouring the steaming soup into a bowl.  The woman didn’t seem to actually care about the things she was asking or talking about, but spoke like it was her duty.  
	The Monster came down the stairs. 
	“I put your bags in your room, Josephine,” he said.  “Do you want me to show you where that is?”
	Josephine nodded, her eyes peeking out from under thick lashes, and followed him up the stairs.  The size intimidated her; she was used to the safety of a smaller room.  The height of the ceiling alone made her feel vulnerable and she hugged her arms for security.  Josephine didn’t think she would ever have enough things to fill the room.
	“It’s so large,” she muttered her first words in her new life.
	The Monster grinned down at her, eager for a flow of conversation.  “I hope you like it, kiddo!  I really hope you like it here, Jo Jo.  Is it okay if I call you Jo Jo?” he chuckled and ran a large hand across cropped, dark hair.  “Me and the misses get pretty lonely sometimes.  I think you’re going to make our lives a lot more fun!”
	She smiled back at him, releasing the grip on her arms.
	That night and the next few nights went well for her.  Josephine was starting to really enjoy the new house and her new family.  She easily accepted her new mother, and even felt comfortable enough to call her mom after only three months of living there.  They had similar reserved natures and Josephine latched onto her as someone she could sit in comfortable silence with.  This new life hadn’t offered anything worth talking about yet and Josephine was in the habit of forgetting her past.  With the mother there was no pressure of having to talk, like she felt with the Monster.  Once she offered up her opinion about the bedroom, he was always asking her questions and trying to find ways to bring her retired voice back to life.  He never tried to talk to the mother, though, who watched his attempts through aged eyes.
	The first night Josephine was introduced to the real Monster started off as any other.  She was sleeping, the Monster had gone out like he normally did, and the mother was downstairs watching television.  A loud bang woke Josephine.  She lay in bed straining to hear what was going on downstairs.  She got up and crept to the stairs to better understand.
	“You’re drunk again!  How can you do this?  We have Josephine now; you can’t just go out drinking every night!  God, Richard, she needs a father- not some drunken mess!” the mother said, her voice cracking with the strain of begging for the same miracle more than once.
	“You leave me alone,” the Monster slurred back, his voice increasing in pitch as frustration grew.  “I do the best I can.  DON’T YELL AT ME MARYANN!”
	She could hear the fright in her mother’s next statement.  “I know Richard; I just think you shouldn’t drink as much as you do.  It worries me.  I’m worried Richard.”
	“Don’t worry, baby,” he replied as if the fight were ending. 
	Her mother said something inaudible, probably something that shouldn’t have been said aloud.  Josephine heard the sound of skin hitting skin and a thump as her mother’s body fell to the ground.  She pictured the mother wiping away a trickle of blood, trying to recuperate from the impact, and her heart skipped a beat.
	“DON’T GIVE ME THAT ATTITUDE MARYANN!  HOW MANY TIMES DO I NEED TO TELL YOU?” he roared from downstairs.
	The sound of another strike echoed in her eardrums followed by muffled sobs, and then the sound of clumsy, heavy footsteps as he walked toward the staircase.  Josephine knew she had to get out of there but no matter how much her brain pleaded with her legs, she sat frozen to the top step, shaking while tears streaked down her cheeks.  The Monster came into view and stopped at the bottom step staring up at Josephine.  He was encased in darkness again, a shadow to her.  He wobbled in his drunken stupor and then gripped the railing, making his way upstairs.
	Now Josephine’s legs were ready to listen, and she ran into her room, shutting the door behind her.  She hid in the corner of the large, still empty room, curled into a ball and trying to disappear into the darkness.  The Monster’s footsteps echoed in the empty hall and stopped outside of her door.  The door creaked as he opened it slowly, and she cried harder when she saw his enormous form taking up the entire doorframe.  
	“What’s wrong, Jo Jo?  Scared of monsters?” he slurred as he made his drunken path toward her.
	The next morning her mother came to her room to wake her for breakfast.  They sat together quietly in the room as she showed Josephine how to hide the bruises with make-up, a secret they were able to share in their silence.

	The bones in his knees cracked as he bent to crouch in front of her supposed sleeping figure.  His breath was hot and damp against her cool cheeks, and her nose twitched as the overwhelming shock of whiskey reached her nostrils.  Her heart pounded even quicker than before, her thoughts an overpowering buzz in her ears.
	She heard the smile in his voice.  “What are you doing up so late, Jo Jo?  Waiting for Daddy to come home safe?”

	After her one mistake of getting caught, the Monster made his way to Josephine’s room as part of his routine.  Each time was different.  Sometimes she would leave the safety of her bed and try to hide in the room, never daring to actually leave the vast bedroom.  He always found her, curled up in a corner somewhere shaking and sobbing.  Sometimes luck would be on the girl’s side and he would be too drunk to remember his final stop.  On the nights she did escape him however, the Monster always caught her in dreams.  He lurked in the shadows, but she always knew he was there because of the strong smell of whiskey and the slow, heavy footsteps that filled her heart with dread and echoed in her mind.
	Josephine was never able to bring herself run away; she couldn’t even make herself leave the sanctity of her bedroom.  When the case workers came to check up on Josephine, the Monster became the man she met her first night in the house.  Her mother played along and acted as a silent background character, and Josephine followed her lead unsure of what her other options were.  The Monster no longer tried to talk to her during the day and she understood how the mother came to be a nervous mute.  Fear laced with uncertainty made Josephine remain in the same position every night, awaiting the wrath of the Monster.

Something felt different about this night to Josephine, but she couldn’t concentrate on one thought for long enough to figure out what it could be.  Slowly a plan devised itself in her mind and she gained the confidence to attempt an escape.  Tonight the course of events would finally change.
	She already knew the Monster had caught her; faltering even slightly was enough for him to know.  Josephine was quivering with anticipation; the flame of hope burned inside her for the first time in her life.  She let her brave eyes flutter open and stared straight into the Monster’s distorted face.
	A frightening smile crawled across his shadowed face, the warm whiskey-soaked breath stinging her cheeks.  Josephine stared back into the darkened face that she saw so many times in her nightmares, gripping the covers as he slurred his sentences at her.
	“Jo Jo,” he said.  “I always wanted a son, Jo Jo.  But you’re much better I decided.  Me and your mother love you so much, Jo Jo.  We’re so happy to-”
	Josephine didn’t want to hear anymore of his lies, and chose that moment to leap into action, throwing the covers over the confused Monster and pushing into his chest.  He toppled backwards, stunned for a moment.
	Josephine leapt up and crossed the room in a flash of hope, the flame fully engulfing her now.  However, in the second it took her to reach the other side of the room, her flame had gone out completely and sad realization dawned on the girl.  The locked door laughed at her misfortune.  
It only made sense that a Monster like this would lock the door.  Even though Josephine never ran, it would obviously be a precaution he’d want to take.  How could he risk the off-chance that his step-daughter would want to play a brave role?  While the girl panicked in anticipation of his arrival, the click of the door locking evaded her eardrums.  She had believed he understood the fear he thrust upon her, and in knowing his power, decided not to take precautions.  Josephine’s assumption tore at her body as she regretted even thinking escape was possible.  
‘You should’ve known!’ her brain shrieked at her. ‘How could you be so stupid?’
The Monster roared livid with anger and tore the blanket off, whipping it to the floor.  He regained his balanced and lumbered at the poor girl fumbling to unlock the door.  Her shaking hands couldn’t handle the cruel lock, and as she finally pulled the door open, the Monster caught up and slammed it closed again.
He turned on the girl and locked the door behind him, her figure shrinking into the floor as he loomed over her.  The tears forced their ways out of her eyes and Josephine envied them for their ability to leave.  The Monster’s broad figure was all she could see; there were no surroundings in the empty room, not even the cream colored walls.  The angry shadow was everything, and she wanted to look away but her eyes knew better.  The worst part was that she angered the Monster in the process of failing.
“I was trying to speak with you,” he said through clenched teeth.  “Why wouldn’t you listen to me, Jo Jo?”
Josephine tensed her body, squeezing into the safety of the corner.  She screamed as the Monster lowered himself toward her, the shadow overtaking her small form, the stench of whiskey suffocating her.

This is due in part to the way Atticus has brought them up, and by a child’s in-grown idea of challenging everything. Initially, the children believe the town’s rumors about Boo, they are scared of Boo and see it as a challenge to draw him out. With their imaginations running in high gear, Scout and Jem frequently sneak into the Radley residence. They learn more as to the details of Boo’s house arrest and slowly begin to change their opinions of him. Boo furthers the process by giving them gifts. “It was then…that Jem and [Scout] first began to part company” (56). This is due to the fact that Jem is growing older, and also because Atticus has influenced him enough that he could understand larger moral dilemmas, which Scout was not capable comprehending. The gifts represent and olive branch of sorts, Jem understands that Boo whishes to be left around, and because Jem looses interest, Scout follows in suit. Jem also infects Scout’s mind, although his intentions are good, part of Jem’s view of the world rubs off on Scout as she begins to question the actions of Nathan Radley. Although scout believes he stance on Boo’s imprisonment to be her own, Jem has played a major part in her formulating this idea. The mystique surrounding Boo and Nathan Radley shows that Scout and Jem are intelligent children, who are capable of making their own decisions and opinions instead of subscribing to the rumor mill.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_lcaqk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/lcaqk/english_single_paragraph_how_boo_radley_affects/,

Vapour Corporation isn’t its real name it is just a name we have come to know it by because it keeps no records and all money is paid to staff in cash, no one has ever worked there for more than 2 years and most people who work there are never heard from again, they turn to “Vapour” and disappear. 
This was a reason why I was very reluctant to take work there but hell there is no other place that a black man can work these days, after Obama in 2012 a racist dictator named Kane Blood liquidised parliament and he has run things ever since. Recently it was revealed that Kane ran The Vapour Corporation. I guess that’s why he was able to gain so much power so quickly. The bad thing for me is that he has now set his sights on taking over Jerusalem, I guess being a religious fanatical person in power for 20 years makes you want to take the last religious settlement there is. There is one problem with this though, in the great war of 2020 Jerusalem was lost under hundreds of tonnes worth of stone after the Israelis decided to destroy a Muslim refugee settlement located 60 miles away. The force of the new bomb, which was christened the Apple of Eden because of the way it tempts a man, caused all the stone in the ground to move and consequently the way to make the bomb and Jerusalem sunk under hundreds of kilometres worth of Earth. I think that Kane is sending us to Jerusalem because he wants a way to threaten the last free colonies on the Earth and the orbit cities with the richest of people who love freedom on them. I am part of a Spec ops military team known as triple runners. We are a team of nine people that have all served in the worst of wars over the past 10 years, I guess me and Raphael were chosen because we both served in the North Korean invasion of 2022 and the Russian hammer invasion of 2026.
As we land on the ground that used to be Jerusalem we realise that something is wrong, we see that there is a tunnel that goes down to Jerusalem but there is a dismembered man next to a sign and in blood the sign says “Keep Out” over the faded paint of what was once said. While the team is preparing we hear a noise not too far from us and as we turn to look at it we see that we are being shot at! I feel a strange tingling in my shoulder but I ignore it there are more important things at hand but as I begin to fire in the direction that the fire is coming from and it isn’t too soon after when everything goes black... 
As I arise I am surround by the palest of faces, it is as if they have never stared at the sun, when I saw Hebrew writing on the wall I realised I was in a hospital in Jerusalem this usually would have alarmed me but I guess that being pumped full of drugs helps calm you down. The faces parted from in front of me and what I guess was a doctor came towards me and started talking to me, his English surprisingly good. “Are you in any pain right now?” he asked me still dazed from the drugs I could not reply “good that means the drugs are working, my name is Gregory I was once a volunteer doctor before this happened to the city.” He paused for a second, “you may be wondering how this is all possible well it is going to take some explaining.” We talked for a long time but eventually I understood that the caves that had existed under Jerusalem took Jerusalem into them and the city broke off into about 3 parts this was 3 parts made up of 45% of the city however and all parts existed deeper than where I was. I was then told that we were attacked by Terrorists made up of the American forces who wished to draw the people of Jerusalem out or alternatively scare them enough so they couldn’t come up for food and would starve so then the Americans could go in and pillage what was left of Jerusalem. It was then that I was told perhaps the worst news so far, all my team had been killed in the attack so it was just me, by this time I had been off the drugs long enough that I had my bearings and so I got the people to take me to the top so that I could kill all of the terrorists who slaughtered my team, The people assisted me because they were spurred by my courage and we managed to defeat the surrounding troops.

In the article “College Girl to Call Girl” the author, Sarah Schmidt, brings forth the reality that some University students are turning to prostitution to pay for the ever increasing educational fees of University. Sarah Schmidt describes the lives of some of the students that are involved in the prostitution. The students do not refer to themselves as hookers, but rather as high-end call girls because they work from houses or expensive hotels, which are purchased by the professional rich men. Due to the increasing tuition fees in Canada and the low minimum wages in most provinces, students are leaving University with an average of $25,000 worth of debt, which evidently has led to an incline in off-street prostitution, which makes up 80% of Canada’s prostitution industry. Some students have gotten into the business because of the good pay, although they claim it’s only temporary until they can begin their professional careers. Some people find it hard to believe that students are involved in such an industry and, although some of the students come from a troubled background, many of them do no; because of this the sex industry has become more and more socially accepted with a variety of participants. To cope with the degrading aspects of the job the students would have intelligent conversations with their clients and stay in high class hotels because they believed that, that made it okay, although outreach workers claim it’s prostitution either way. The students know that prostitution is not the job that they would like to continue but, with the increasing tuition prices, prostitution gives them enough money to get through schooling and work towards the job that they truly desire. 

A Summary of Crystal Balls
In the essay “Crystal Balls” the author, Kim Pittaway, poses the question: “What does the future hold for Canadian women?” Although Kim writes of some people who believe the future belongs to women, Kim makes it clear that, that is not what she wants. Kim does not deny the progress that women have made over the years for their independence such as, earning pay almost equal to that of a man and the freedom of choice that women have been given for their career choices. However, Kim argues that women and man should be equals rather than having one gender on top. She sees the future of women much more broad rather than a focus on women first. Kim is influenced by her friend’s view of the world that gender attributes are not as important anymore as are individual attributes. She states that newer generations are forgetting about gender biases and focusing more on what people can do as individuals. Kim’s friend does not deny that men still hold most of the power, although Kim hopes that the shift for women is a shift for gender equality, not dominance by a specific gender.

It's hard to list all the ways you've been a blessing in my life. Of course I am grateful for your amazing generosity. I'm also grateful for you as a person... It's been a pleasure and an honor getting to know you.

Before I met you, I had no idea what to expect, partially due to your insistence on remaining a ""looming, mysterious authority figure."" But the real culprit was Derp's, shall we say... one-dimensional portrayal of you. Derpina likes to reminisce about you and me quoting ""Jabberwocky"" over burgers at TJ's, but for me the defining experience was when you took Derp and me for a night tour around Minneapolis. As you chauffered us around town amiably, you told us the story of that famous poster where the hippie girl is putting a flower in the soldier's gun... about how you were there that day, and about what it meant to you. I was blown away. I realized that, not only did you have more than one dimension, you were an exceptionally colorful, entertaining, and thought-provoking person to be around. 

I've continued to be pleasantly surprised as I get to know you better. I enjoy your cheerful, boisterous presence; I respect your kind and compassionate nature; I admire your fair-mindedness and integrity. When I turn 70, I'll be lucky to have accomplished half as much as you have, and to have half as many great stories of a life well lived.

Thanks for being a friend, a role model, a fellow audiophile and cineaste, and just a really cool guy. Here's to many more movie nights and snooty academic discussions of Impressionist paintings.

Happy Birthday!

	I am writing this letter to petition the suspension of my financial aid because of my failure to meet the constituents of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy in the summer quarter of the 2010 school year.  The deficiency of my credit progress was due to personal reasons that I will explain in this letter. Since the time of the suspension award, I have attended WWU and have met Satisfactory Academic Progress as of the current winter quarter. 
	During the winter quarter of 2010 I was attending WWU and completing the last of the GURs for my intended major. During this quarter my girlfriend became pregnant with our child. The implications of this required that I refocus my attention away from school and into the obligations I was experiencing with my girlfriend. On April 9th 2010, I visited the office of Student Financial Services and made arrangements to pay the debts I acquired because of my decision to forfeit my financial aid award and not attend WWU for unknown period of time. I made such arrangements with the Loans and Collection Office and I believed that I had taken the necessary steps to forfeit my award and be free from any compounding complications in regards to the award.
 On April 16th 2010 I enrolled in an independent learning course that I paid for with my own private funds. This class was the final stipulation that needed to be completed before I could apply for admission into my degree program. My intention was to complete this course at the flexibility of my personal commitment to my girlfriend and our child and someday, somehow, graduate with my desired degree. In the month of June 2010, my girlfriend experienced a miscarriage and lost the expected child. The time that followed the miscarriage was extremely exhausting both emotional and physically and placed tremendous stresses on both my personal relationships and my own private life. It was this summer quarter of 2010 that my financial aid was suspended due my failure to complete the correspondence course in the allotted time frame that I had enrolled in.
	I enrolled in classes on the main campus of WWU for fall quarter 2010, paid tuition with my own private funds, and completed all my classes with satisfactory grades. I have enrolled classes on main campus for winter quarter 2011 and additionally I will be completing my correspondence course during this time. However, I cannot continue to finance my education with out additional assistance. I will not receive any financial contributions from my family and cannot afford to attend WWU with out the subsidies of financial aid and additional private loans.  My commitment to graduating from WWU with a Bachelors of Arts in Urban Planning from Huxley is now again the most pertinent area of my focus. My ability to achieve this degree has resounding significance in regards to the future I intend to create for future family and myself. But with out reinstatement of my ability to receive financial aid while attending WWU, I surely cannot achieve the goal of graduating with my desired degree.
	I appreciate all your time and effort in allowing me the opportunity to explain my situation. I hope that this letter illustrates the unfortunate circumstances that led to my inadequate progress while attending WWU and all the while illustrating my passion to continue attending WWU. Again, thank you for your time and effort. Anxiously awaiting your decision,

Did it change you? If so, how?)",chuelita,4,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1jpjje/college_essayplease_critique_prompt_describe_a/,"My heartbeat quickens, my muscles strain, and my sweat flows freely—yet I continue lifting the barbell despite my body’s agony. Only after becoming physically unable to lift any longer do I stop. The barbell clangs to the floor, as if it’s relieved to finally be freed from my hands. A breath is taken in and exhaled slowly; my heartbeat lessens, my muscles relax, and my sweat trickles. My feet walk over to the next set of weights, and the agony begins again. 
	Surprisingly, this physical distress is undertaken with welcoming arms. I yearn only for the harshest workouts, for it has become a mentality that the harder I push myself, the greater the reward will be. So, not only has lifting weights become routine, but also anaerobic exercises. The weightlifting will help develop my muscles, while the cardio will help me lose every ounce of fat I have gained from the past. Every drop of sweat felt dripping down my back is another ounce of fat leaving my slowly developing body. 
Memories of my past physique both haunt and motivate me to amendment myself; to evolve into a better person. Every time an extremely difficult portion of a workout is reached, it is reminders that keep me strong. Reminders of the time I looked in the mirror and realized my body had become subpar to what was strived for. Reminders of the time I stood by the public pool, too embarrassed to take off my shirt. Reminders of the time my friend informed me that I had gained a significant amount of weight. These reminders have all been forever erased through every endured pushup, every weight lifted, and every workout completed. The preparation and the journey itself have not been easy. To motivate oneself to take action is one thing; however; truly taking action is a different story. Even after spending a substantial amount of time motivating myself to get fit, not enough willpower was found to actually get out of my chair and start working out. The realization that a failure was imminent dawned upon me, and I became aware that by not partaking in fulfilling my current goals, I was building an unstable foundation for my future goals. In order to prevent this failure, I needed to change my approach towards working out.  I forced my mind to view working out as a hobby, a passion, a way to relieve stress. Whenever a feeling of anger or discontent ever came into my mind from any unrelated topic, I would immediately begin curling dumbbells.  Whenever the feeling of laziness began surfacing, I would quickly drop to the floor and begin doing push-ups. Once this became a habit, my lifestyle completely changed. I escalated workout routines to include intense interval cardio training, which slowly melted off body fat. More weight training was later added to the mix, and muscles began surfacing. All of this was added with a strict nutrition and low calorie diet, and it took less than two weeks for noticeable results to ensue. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of rewards earned from working out. My metabolism, energy levels, appetite, and muscle mass grew; and these results produced even more motivation. The only thing that lessened was my body fat percentage. 
By becoming my own personal trainer and motivator, I finally succeeded in losing most of my body fat and forming a daily habit of working out. This not only put a new burden of responsibility onto my shoulders, but it also matured me. The recognition that changing oneself requires the right mindset will always be embedded into my lifestyle. By taking action in working out, I also began doing so in other aspects. My productivity and effectiveness increased drastically over time, and in a wide range of areas. Whenever a household chore needed to be done, it would immediately be taken care of. Whenever a homework assignment was given out, it was completed on the same day it was given. With the extra energy boost that lifting weights supplied me, my productivity exponentially grew. My lifestyle was again evolved, and I found myself in complete control of every task thrown at me. 
The agony has ended. The weights are placed back on the rack, where they will patiently wait until the next athlete decides to use them. A towel is dragged over the entirety of my body, where it greedily soaks up my perspiration. Stepping over to the mirror, shirtless, I scrutinize my new build. A smile spreads across my face; satisfaction is finally reached. My phone vibrates, and the screen displays a text message: Refrigerator’s empty. Pick up groceries for this week. Without a second thought, my feet bring me to the gym’s entrance and I proceed with my next task.

My mother had to play the role of a father as well as raise her three children, one girl and two boys, by herself. The father of my brotherRyan and I, walked out on us before we could ever realize who he was to us. I never saw him until I was eleven. To this day, we don't call him dad. All he is to me is a man named Josh who cares more about a women who controls his life and her son. My eyes water every time I think about him because he never cared about his only little girl, me, and probably never will. When he left, my mom met my second brother Jacob's dad. He was there for ten years of my life and he is he man I call my dad. He may not be in my life anymore, but he does treat me more like a daughter than my real father. After several mistakes, my mom got fed  up with him and left. She had a best friend named Mike, that had been there for her since kindergarten that helped her through her rough moments. All of us would go to his house and jam to music while sitting around the open pit fire in the back yard or like me and my best cousin (who I call my sister) we would dance on the wood fence around the pit. He would cook elk stake dinners with a loaded baked potato. Not long after that we started staying the night on weekends and then school nights. Finally one day, I asked Mike and my mom if they were together because I was confused. That was the day they defined their relationship. They were together for about four months and it was always back and forth from our house in Bloomfield to his on the Bloomfield Highway. He had three kids, Joey and Allen were the two boys and Annie was his little girl. I had always wanted a sister but never had one and now I had the chance to be somebody's role model. Someone who looked up to me. Since we first met, she was attached at my hip. I remember our first Christmas together. Mike made me a hand made Russian Olive jewelry box which was one of the best gifts I'd ever gotten. I started to realize he might be the father I was looking for. Next thing I knew we were packing. Time to move in to his house to become a real family. At first it was a squeeze for everybody. Four boys in one room, two girls in the other, and the parents in the master bedroom. The boys and girls had to share one little bathroom which sucked. Mike, he could do everything imagined! He could build houses, work in the oilfield, reconstruct cars, he can run pluming, electric, almost everything you could think of! So what he did was build on an addition with a huge living room and another master bedroom with a bathroom. He gave Annie and me the master bedroom and bathroom they use to have. They moved down the new one. Two of the boys moved into one room and the other two stayed in the original room they had. I never had anyone do that for me because they thought I'd be more comfortable. I was honestly truly grateful. Mike use to be on the District Six Fire Department as assistant chief. He has inspired me to join too when I'm sixteen. He use to go on wild fires and be gone anywhere from two weeks to a month. That supported us in the summer but we struggled in the winter so Mike left the department and got a job at Odessa Pumps. For the first time in a long time, we had a weekend off so we, the whole family plus my uncle and grandma, took a trip through Durango, then Silverton, all the way to Ouray Colorado. It was amazingly fun. On our way back home, we stopped at a waterfall where you could walk on an overlook in thin air. Even though my mom is scared of heights, she walked almost halfway across and that's where it happened. I couldn't whip out my camera fast enough to get a picture of Mike on one knee, but I did get a picture when they were hugging, then kissing, then smiling. That was a good day for everyone. The date was set, March 23, two thousand thirteen. Mike's sister was the best woman and my moms brother was the best man. I, being the oldest girl, stood up with my mom and Allen, being the oldest boy, stood with his dad. That day was finally there and I asked to make a toast during the reception, well I lost all my words and had to wing it. My point was to tell everyone how I'm glad my mom is finally happy and how I finally have a father. I then turned to Mike and looked him in the eyes and said, ""I know none of this is about me, but would you be willing to adopt Ryan and I?"" I'm not a Bradshaw yet but I eventually will. Since then, everything has been a dream come true. We are currently remodeling my bathroom and my closet and the boys bathroom. I hope we will be a family forever! My point is Mike has helped me look away from my past and push forward. That is also one reason why I do my best in school. He has told me so much that I have learned from and that has changed me for the best. He has helped make me the person I am today. He has showed me that my mom can be happy which has made me a happier person too. Honestly I'm truly blessed to have the family I do today. Mike has changed my life so much, but nothing can compare to how much my mom has taught me. To talk about her, I would have a four thousand page book!  ",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_1jnd5b,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1jnd5b/a_man_named_mike/,

I would ask a friend or something, but have just moved last October, and pretty much spend all my free time juggling work and school. Just wondering if anyone would mind taking a look at it and giving me some constructive criticism?  

The things that are bothering me are, of course, citations, I have no information data in the paper so I'm not quite sure what part of the essay cite and where I should throw an intext. 

Also it's been while since I've been in school, but I vaguely remember something about verb tense and trying to use only one in the paper...
I emailed my professor on this, but haven't heard back.

I'll include the guidelines that was given, as well as a peer revision sheet, if anyone is feeling so gracious (I think she is going to wonder why me and my roommate Marly have the exact same penmanship soon)

Also, its kinda corny... I apologize ahead of time.

I REALLY want to take this class, so I decided to take my chances and email the head of the english department.*

Here it is:

Mr. (professor),

I understand that you have reached a definitive ""No"" regarding my appeal for english next year, but because I am very adamant about this I would at least like to make one last plea.

First, I feel as if it is worth noting that I did achieve an A- in the 4th quarter of my sophomore year, showing that I did end my underclassman years on a high note. Additionally, you have my word that my drive to succeed has increased significantly since sophomore year. My efforts grew throughout the year, hence my improvement in Dr. (my professor last year)'s class. Because of this, I feel as if next year I will have more success as a result of my desire to increase my efforts.

Lastly, I'd like to make a suggestion: is it possible that I could start out in AP English, and if my work in the class does not meet your standards within the first few weeks, I can move down to English 11? It is my understanding that this a common occurrence in the math department (i.e. honors math--&gt;accelerated math).

If, after all this, you are still sure of your decision, could you at least share the materials I'd need to study in order to succeed on the exam this May? I'd like to get a start on them this summer.

Thank you!

- Me

(NOTE: English 11 is the regular class that I was originally placed in, AP English 11 is the advanced placement class that I'm trying to get into)

Also, to explain the example with the math department, accelerated math is below honors math. Many students at my school move down to accelerated if they do not meet the grade requirement for honors.

Frank, Thomas.  “Rent-a-Womb Is Where Market Logic Leads.”  Wall Street Journal  10 Dec.  2008: A17. Print.


At long last, our national love affair with the rich is coming to a close. The moguls whose exploits we used to follow with such fascination, it now seems, plowed the country into the ground precisely because of the fabulous rewards that were showered on them.  Massive inequality, we have learned, isn't the best way to run an economy after all. And when you think about it, it's also profoundly ugly.

Some people haven't received the memo, though. Take Alex Kuczynski, author of the New York Times Magazine cover story for Nov. 30, which tells how she went about hiring another woman to bear her child.

For years Ms. Kuczynski worked the plutocracy beat for the New York Times, and in her whimsical way she described the travails of the world's supermodels, the scene-making that went on at this or that high-end restaurant, and the feeling on the hard streets of Greenwich and the Hamptons.

Somewhere along the way, Ms. Kuczynski went from observer to observed. She married a hedge-fund billionaire and in 2005 was the subject of a memorable bit of plute-worship in W magazine. Here we learned about her four homes (including one on Park Avenue and one in Southampton) but mainly about her really inaccessible spread in Idaho, where everything has to be flown in: the masseuses, the meat, the guests, the yoga instructor, the chefs, and the logs that were required to restore the property's log cabins to her husband's exacting standards.

Now Ms. Kuczynski's trademark concern for the moneyed becomes memoir as she relates to us, in last week's Times Magazine, her ""adventures with a surrogate mom."" The story starts with Ms. Kuczynski's infertility, which is genuinely piteous, but quickly goes wrong, as she and her husband decide to hire a woman to carry their child and review applications from women with available wombs.

Surrogate motherhood has been the subject of much philosophical and political dispute over the years. To summarize briefly, it is a class-and-gender minefield. When money is exchanged for pregnancy, some believe, surrogacy comes close to organ-selling, or even baby-selling. It threatens to commodify not only babies, but women as well, putting their biological functions up for sale like so many Jimmy Choos. If surrogacy ever becomes a widely practiced market transaction, it will probably make pregnancy into just another dirty task for the working class, with wages driven down and wealthy couples hiring the work out because it's such a hassle to be pregnant.

Ms. Kuczynski is not entirely oblivious to these issues; indeed, she considers them for several poignant paragraphs before inevitably brushing them off.

It's ""organ rental,"" Ms. Kuczynski decides; nothing worse. She is taken with the surrogate's reference to herself as an ""Easy-Bake oven""--a toy appliance--and further describes her as ""a vessel, the carrier, the biological baby sitter, for my baby."" And, yes, the surrogate applicants could all use the money, if not desperately; the one who gets the job plans to use it to help pay her kids' way through college. Additionally, one of the surrogate's children, Ms. Kuczynski notes, ""had been an egg donor to help pay her college tuition.""

Maybe if this young woman had been donating her eggs to buy groceries Ms. Kuczynski would have understood that all this reproduction-for-hire was a product of her billionaire-centric world as surely as the Blahniks and Versace she used to trill about--that college and surrogacy are available to people like Ms. Kuczynski and not to others because that's how our system works.

Instead she tells us, very sincerely, how much she enjoyed spending the last few months before the child arrived ""by white-water rafting down Level 10 rapids on the Colorado River""--presumably Level 10 rapids are really quality rapids--""racing down a mountain at 60 miles per hour at ski-racing camp, drinking bourbon and going to the Super Bowl."" She also does a lot of ""Bikram yoga,"" which is presumably a really quality form of yoga.

What she doesn't tell us is even more revealing. Of the story's nearly 8,000 words, there are only three quotations from the surrogate mother. Ms. Kuczynski does not describe this remarkable woman's clothes or, really, tell us her thoughts about much of anything. About Ms. Kuczynski's own feelings and fears and cravings we get paragraph after maudlin paragraph. The one who does the labor is almost completely silent.

Then there are the photographs, already infamous: Ms. Kuczynski in a black sleeveless sheath and stiletto-heel pumps, posing next to the pregnant surrogate in khakis and a tousled pink flannel shirt. Ms. Kuczynski holding the baby on the lawn of her Southampton estate, with columns, topiary and servant. The surrogate sitting, barefoot and alone, on a beat-up porch of her house in Pennsylvania.

According to the Times's ""Public Editor"" column, Ms. Kuczynski objected to the pictures before the article was published. And who knows? Maybe the photographers and art directors were out to subvert her story all along. If so, they understood market relations far better than the author herself.

As intelligent beings, we often question who we are and how we should live our lives. We sit and ponder over our decisions; we question whether or not they were wise or carry true merit. While living in this ever changing world we attempt to thrive and exceed beyond our expectations. We are capable of doing things that often seem impossible or appear to define the laws that compose our existence, all the while trying to break boundaries to discover the mysteries of the universe, and what our place in it may be.Yet, in the end we are essentially left with only more questions and uncertainty. As if we were living in a maze with no end, we never truly understand who we are. In the end left with nothing more then the certainty of death; we are surround by lost dreams, and never answered questions of what could have been, as we are often unable to live our lives to the fullest. Left with what only seem to be a haze of the memories that once were.

A few years ago my life as I knew it became flipped upside down leaving me sitting lost and confused surrounded by endless unanswered questions towards myself and my life. I was like a helpless child on his first day at a new school. I didn’t know what to do or where to go; the never ending spiral of confusion within the depths of my consciousness never seemed to end. For, I seemed to have temporarily lost touch with who I was as a person, the core essence with which I was born, and I had found myself completely helpless. That was until I found the art of yoga. 

Being an exercise enthusiast most my life I often contemplated beginning my journey into the practice of yoga, so that I would be given the opportunity to experience its wide range of physiological and mental benefits. Though, it wasn’t until two years ago when I found myself completely lost and unsure of what to do with my life that I finally stepped my foot in the water, and began what would soon become a life long journey. My first day inside the yoga studio I felt as if I had walked through a different dimension, I questioned if I had still been on earth, for it just couldn’t have been the case. For never before had I been given the opportunity to meet a group of individuals whom truly had no judgment, criticism, or hate for those around them. They were filled with nothing more than compassion, love, and dedication to their practice and those they had the opportunity to share it with. Each instructor and student expressed such passion towards their practice, not only for themselves, but towards helping their fellow disciples on their journey as they attempt to reach enlightenment, a point of endless happiness in life, which words just simply can’t express.

Still to this day I remember the joy on my instructor face as she hugged me at the end of my first class. For I will never forget the peace and serenity I felt, within. For in that very moment in time nothing else seemed to matter; I had no worries or fears. The past was insignificant and the future felt unpredictable. It also showed me that worrying or stressing about something I simply can’t control was foolish, and the equivalent to insanity. For I only have the ability to make good choices in life, not the ability to control what there outcome will bring me. 

Through my journey, I’ve learned that we are not the situations we experience or things we do. We are not our cars, jobs, or the amount of wealth we posses. We are not are emotions or the way we feel on a day to day basis. I slowly discovered that we aren’t the things I always felt defined us as individuals and human beings. I saw that by stripping away our fears, worries, desires, failures, and all the things that miss defined us as individuals, we can learn to be contempt with who we are and what we will become. I learned that through the art of yoga and meditation I could slowly develop a deeper awareness of my physiological and psychological states; gradually beginning to purify my mind, body, and spirit. Though, enlightenment may never be reached within my lifetime I’ve gained an understanding that through daily practice I could allow myself to slowly be contempt with who I am, and teach myself how to better manage my thoughts and feeling; someday becoming okay with simply being present and enjoying every finite moment of my passing existence.

1369301987.0,2,self.Proofreading,1ew7yt,Short Catcher in the Rye essay,sams1623,2,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1ew7yt/short_catcher_in_the_rye_essay/,"The prompt is to compare Holden Caulfield to a Biblical character, the demoniac, a man who is possessed by several demons and constantly hurts himself until Jesus comes along and saves him from the demons.

Our teacher says not to have an introductory paragraph, thesis, or conclusion. Just go straight to the content.

Here's the essay:

Holden proactively searches for adulthood, but some of the ways that he searches for adulthood are unnecessary and lead him nowhere. His search begins after he is expelled from his fourth school due to failing grades. Holden, despite being intelligent, never put in any effort and this has caused him to move from school to school with no success. This lack of will to work toward the future truly hurts Holden. In addition to hurting himself through lack of effort,  Holden’s search for adulthood also proves to hurt Holden in emotional ways. One way Holden searches for adulthood is through sex. For example, Holden asks a schoolmate, Stradlater, if he had sex with an old friend of his. Stradlater replies diplomatically, saying “That’s a professional secret, buddy” (43). Holden then punches Stradlater, and they get in a fight. There are two reasons why Holden does this. The first is because he’s jealous that Stradlater had sex with this old friend of his, Jane Gallagher, when Holden never did. Holden says that this girl is the girl with whom he came the closest to necking, which could motivate his jealousy. The other thing that bothers Holden is Stradlater’s use of the word professional. Holden can’t know a professional secret because he isn’t a professional, implying Holden isn’t an adult. This sort of condescending language makes Holden furious, thus inspiring him to hurt Stradlater. Holden doesn’t understand that he won’t become an adult by having sex. To believe you are an adult because you have had sex leads one to live vicariously through this experience, and only acts as a sign of immaturity. Another way he searches for adulthood is intellectual conversation. He searches desperately for someone to talk to easily, but succeeds only with his sister. When he talks to Sally Hayes at dinner, he suggests that they run away together. Sally disregards this completely, even though Holden really means it. Sally fails to reason with him in a manner that keeps him calm. “You can’t just do something like that… in the first place, were both practically children. And did you ever stop to think what you’d do if you didn’t get a job when your money ran out?” (132).  Holden faces emotional pain as a result of Sally’s harsh criticism. Lastly, Phoebe manages to make Holden feel guilty when Holden does something wrong: “’You don’t like anything that’s happening’ (says Phoebe) It made me even more depressed when she said that” (169). Phoebe makes Holden feel sad, an emotion that motivates him to change, while everyone else only triggers anger, an emotion that makes him verbally destructive. Anger makes him curse, while sadness makes him change. 

Similar to the Demoniac, Holden is hurting himself in a number of ways. The Demoniac hurts himself in a clear, physical manner, by sitting in a cave and cutting himself endlessly due to the demons that possess him. Holden can relate: the demon that possesses him is actually his immaturity. Holden, throughout the book, finds that his immaturity holds him back from academic success, achieving normal interaction, and living a happy life. However, as the book ends, Holden takes a step in the right direction after his confrontation with Phoebe, in which the sadness she triggers within Holden actually inspires him to change. In this case, Phoebe acts as a savior. Similarly, the Demoniac is saved from his demons by Jesus, who extracts them from him just as Phoebe does with Holden’s immaturity. Holden speaks highly of the Demoniac, “the guy I like best in the Bible, next to Jesus, was that lunatic and all, that lives in the tombs and kept cutting himself with stones…that poor bastard” (99). This may be due to a feeling of empathy by Holden for the Demoniac. Holden may realize that he is hurting himself through the decisions he makes, just as the Demoniac does, which causes Holden to identify with the Demoniac and establish an emotional connection.

In contrast, Holden isn’t truly cured from his “demon”, while the Demoniac is, by the end of the novel. In Holden’s case, he has simply come to a harsh realization of himself and the immature choice’s he’s made, which shoots him in the direction toward adulthood. Obviously, this one moment can’t immediately transform him into an adult, but it gets the ball rolling. However, in the Bible passage, it is clear that the Demoniac is immediately cured once Jesus saves him, “And they came to Jesus, and saw the Demoniac sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had had the legion [demons]” (Gospel of Mark, Ch.5, line 15). While the two are similar in their stories of reaching their subjective goals, Holden for adulthood, the Demoniac for a cleansed soul, they differ in that Holden doesn’t fully reach his goal, while the Demoniac does. However, Holden, by the end of the novel, makes it clear that he is on the right path toward his goal.

I have not been absent or late to clinical or a class, have maintained a 3.16 GPA, and I believe it is my passion for nursing that drives my ambition to succeed every day.  My dedication steers me to the finish line--graduation; but most of all it is my joy that wakes me every morning to continue on the path to success. Every day, I learn something new from excellent practitioners.  Though what is most exciting is realizing that—even without a car—I am on the road to becoming the person of my dreams:  a health care provider of excellence, a hero that saves lives, a baccalaureate educated nurse. With every milestone accomplished, every test conquered, and each nursing skill mastered, I am inching closer to my destination every day.
I need this scholarship because I am full-time student, not working, and completely focused on finishing my last two semesters of nursing school. My mother cannot help me because she is disabled and does not work. I spend my time between studying, taking care of my mom and also volunteering at the Ronald McDonald House. The Ronald McDonald House Charities of Alabama is a temporary housing facility for families that have critically ill children that travel to Birmingham for medical treatment. My grandpa is the best:  though he is elderly and retired, he drives me to school and the Ronald McDonald house, and he picks me up every day.  My only job is to study hard, accomplish the goal I have set for myself, and graduate to make my family proud. I will continue to give one-hundred and ten percent in my studies, but I definitely would not be able to complete my studies if it were not for scholarship opportunities. In order to continue on the path, accomplish my goals, and reach my destination, I need your help. 
 	 It has been said that ""the best way to find yourself, is to lose yourself in the service of others.""  Nursing has always been my ideal career path because I have always felt drawn towards science, mathematics, but most of all—helping people. I have volunteered since middle school with organizations such as the March of Dimes and Meals-on-Wheels, and I was president of my high school’s Key Club at Bessemer Academy in 2008, and we would often volunteer around the community.  So from my experience and love of serving others, when it came to choosing a career, nursing provided the platform to continue on that familiar path of service. 
I love working with children, and as a volunteer at the Ronald McDonald house, I work with families and their children.  I can't really explain the joy that being around and helping kids all day gives me. Some of these children spend a large part of their childhood in hospitals. The resilience that these children display in the face of insurmountable odds amazes me. Seeing the children come back to visit after recovery is visible proof that the work of pediatric nurses matters. As a pediatric nurse, I want to know that I've been part of a child's recovery from a being critically and facing insurmountable odds, and near-death experiences. To see them grow up and thrive is a gift. 
 The process of becoming a nurse has been the toughest and most rewarding experience I have had in my life so far. When I am finally able to write RN behind my name, I will not regard those letters as merely a title, but as a promise to each of my future patients that they are in caring, capable hands. I would greatly appreciate being considered for this scholarship. If I am presented with an award, it will contribute to educating a person who has made a commitment to excel and provide superior patient care. Because of my positive attitude, hard work, and love for nursing, I am a person that your organization could be proud to claim as a scholarship recipient.

Due on Tuesday 5/21,Mattnotmattress,3,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1enahi/can_someone_proofread_what_i_have_so_far_due_on/,"(It's an Atheist Existentialism using the book Native Son by Richard Wright as a basis)

In the novel Native Son, by Richard Wright, an African-American man named Bigger Thomas commits a heinous crime and faces immense prejudice for his skin color. Throughout the story’s progression, Bigger’s actions can be connected to a philosophy known as existentialism, which in turn is separated into the two categories: Atheist and Christian existentialism by Jean-Paul Sartre in his expositional speech “Existentialism is a Humanism”. Essentially, as Bigger goes through the motions of his actions, his choices become reflected by either the Christian or Atheist side of existentialism in which he is either dictated by a higher power or acting on his free will. Though the book provides evidence of both forms of existentialism, Wright’s story is a more extensive example of Atheist existentialism. In Native Son, Wright’s story is an example of Atheist Existentialism and conveys the basic understandings of the three facets: anguish, abandonment, and despair throughout the book. Jean-Paul Sartre, in ""Existentialism is a Humanism"", establishes these facets, which Wright uses as the basis of his characters' actions. Through his support of Atheist Existentialism, Wright utilizes the tone and facets of atheist existentialism in Native Son to provoke thought towards one's understanding of ""existence before essence"".

Native Son exemplifies Sartre’s description of atheist existentialism in which he believes that “existence comes before essence”. In Sartre’s lecture, “Existentialism is a Humanism”, Jean-Paul Sartre explains the two natures of existentialism: Christian and Atheist. Sartre establishes that Atheist existentialism means “existence before essence” and establishes that one has control their own will over their actions, and that people’s choices in life have their own consequences, which in turn gives way to the three types of Atheist existentialism: Abandonment, Anguish, and Despair. However Sartre makes it clear that he supports Atheist existentialism but establishes the dominance of Christian existentialism in society. Christian existentialism is the idea that counters Atheist existentialism in the sense of “essence before existence”, that before someone is born, their life is planned out with a pre-determined destiny and that they have no control over their actions. However, this is considered an advantage to Atheist existentialism because when something goes wrong, the blame for the action can be placed on god since they were the “mighty being” that created them in the first place, thus feeling no moral repercussions. Sartre makes it clear of how Atheist existentialism ultimately supersedes Christian existentialism in the end, writing three-fourths of the lecture on his support for this ideology. Sartre distinguishes the idea that people who have control over their actions can set their own achievements and goals, in spite of being dictated their own actions through life. Sartre means to create support for how “man first of all exists encounters himself, surges up in the world and defines himself afterwards” (Sartre). In his lecture, Sartre establishes that above all man exists first and then they find their own meaning/goal in life to achieve. In this certain statement, his usage of the words “surges up” and “defines” connote the method in which humanity finds their own power/place in society and then they define themselves as their actions come full circle, rather than becoming defined by their surroundings. In Native Son, Bigger’s actions play a central part in demonstrating Atheist existentialism throughout the story as his actions ultimately define his character and growth throughout the novel. In Book Two, after Bigger murders Mary, he comes to grip with the actions he’s committed and decides to reap the benefits that he’s created for himself. In the wake of the murder, Bigger begins to realize that in face “he had murdered and had created a new life for himself” (Wright 120). With Wright’s connection between the words “murdered” and “created”, Wright intends to show the Atheist nature in which Bigger’s actions have created a new direction for his life. Sartre’s belief that Atheist existentialism is based upon “existence before essence” is evident in Bigger’s internal change as his defining traits come from his actions, not the “essence” that superseded his birth. In a similar scene to the latter, when Bigger ponders about his new way of life, he realizes that now with the murder, he feels as if he has a new motivation or purpose to life. Bigger feels as if now “things were becoming clear [and] he would know how to act from now on” (120).  With Wright’s usage of “clear” and “act”, the words are dead indicators of atheist existentialism in which Bigger’s perception of the world is now “clear” as opposed to the bleak black-and-white world that he lives in. Bigger now lives with purpose, and he means to use this newfound power in order to accomplish whatever he desires. Due to his sudden acquisition of this courage/power, he feels as if he has control over his future and can do whatever he desires.

However, despite the new secure future that Bigger believes in, he must face the consequences and fallout of his actions. This in turn, relates to the facet Anguish, in which Native Son promotes the idea of Anguish to make the readers understand the impact that their actions have on their surroundings. Sartre believes that man is in constant anguish because people’s actions constantly have an effect on others. Sartre believes that when mankind acts they not only act for themselves, but they are “at the same time a legislator deciding for the whole of mankind” (Sartre). Sartre commends upon man’s power to act but however maintains his belief that man’s actions dictate resulting consequences and responsibilities to others. Further more, by Sartre depicting man as a “legislator” and explicitly stating that man decides for the entirety of mankind, he wants to prove the extensive effects that one’s actions have on the world, maintaining the state of Anguish that the world is in. Native Son provides examples of Anguish that correlates to Bigger’s transition between his black-and-white world, keeping Bigger in a constant state of Anguish. In Book One, before Bigger takes the job at the Daltons, he is given the option of robbing a convenience store owned by a white man. However, his internal fear overweighs his desires to commit to these certain actions. Bigger in the meanwhile believes that “they could have robbed the store and could have gotten away...[hoping that] the fight with Gus covered up what he was trying to hide” (61). Wright’s usage of the words “covered” and “hide” create the idea that Bigger is nothing more at this point than the feeble rat that he encountered at the beginning of Book One. Wright uses the words to create the understanding of the outcomes that have risen as a result of Bigger’s actions, establishing Anguish in the scene. After the murder, Bigger slowly begins to feel the repercussions of the crime and begins to understand the calamity of his actions. Bigger now believed that “his murder of her was more…justified by the fear and shame she had made him feel…it seemed that her actions had evoked fear and shame in him” (127).  The author’s use of “evoked” connotes the provocation of change that Bigger’s actions have brought to his situation and himself. Here, Bigger is beginning to feel the drawbacks of his actions as his bravado slowly turns into fear and shame; creating Anguish internally, and making it substantially harder for him to keep up the lie that he’s telling to the private investigator and the Daltons.

Out of all of Bigger’s capabilities and actions, he strives to push himself out of the development-stalled slums he has grown up in. Bigger however, is in a constant state of Despair, which is the next facet. Wright describes Bigger’s actions and intentions in a way that provokes the thought of Sartre’s definition of Despair. Sartre believes Despair to be present within modern society and especially within the limitations/expectations of the average class. Sartre intends to show that humanity “limits [themselves] to a reliance upon [which]… the probabilities render our actions feasible” (Sartre). Sartre’s ideology explains that individuals plan out certain goals to accomplish, but he/she will tend to end up settling for the bare minimum rather than taking the initiative to fully achieve that goal. The word choice of “limit” and “feasible” further connects humanity’s need for gratification to the appeasement that they receive from coming somewhat close to his/her goal, keeping humanity in a period of despair that limits individuals from innovating themselves further. Wright’s depiction of Bigger’s actions continually puts him a situation of Despair in which he wants to change his life for the better, but is unable to do so because he wants to take the easy way out of his predicaments. During Book One, after Bigger commits the murder, he becomes wrapped up in the intensity and taboo of his actions. He realizes that he can act beyond the boundaries of society, musing that “now that the ice was broken…what was there to stop him?” (101). Wright depicts Bigger’s environment as a very racially segregated and hostile society; making any interracial interaction or crime a huge taboo. The author’s usage of “broken” and the phrase “stop him” indicate that Bigger has acted beyond the mold of society and that he’s gone beyond the despair that constantly plagues him. Since Bigger breaks a huge taboo, he feels the bravado and power of a man that is beyond his own environment, leading him to act beyond his limitations and pursue higher goals. Wright’s depiction of Bigger’s home environment is another reason that he wishes to fly beyond his society to something greater and reflecting Sartre’s idea of Despair. As Bigger continues to act upon this dark deed, he reminisces and reflects on how ignorant and grounded his family/society is, believing that “he was outside of his family now… beyond them… and [now] he had done something which even he had not thought possible” (103). Bigger’s crime institutes the confidence that allows him to assert that he has gone beyond his family and himself. By using “beyond” and “thought possible”, Wright ascertains that because Bigger has committed such a huge taboo, he has surpassed the basic assumptions of society and can now act beyond what his environment dictates him to do. Bigger himself does not believe the immense consequence of his action, but rather desires to use this momentum and confidence to propel himself into something greater, an idea that is coherently existent with Sartre’s interpretation of Despair. 

Wright’s novel can be analyzed as a more extensive example of Atheist existentialism rather than the Christian side; and to further justify the Atheist side; Wright’s characters provide examples of the last facet, Abandonment. Sartre describes man in a way that is relatable to a blank canvas. Due to the Atheist belief in “existence before essence”, there is no direct god or human nature that mankind depends on; instead he/she must experience things for themselves before they define who he/she really is. Sartre exemplifies the abandonment and secularism of mankind in that “god does not exist…it is necessary to draw the consequences of his absence right to the end” (Sartre). Abandonment is explained by Sartre as the existence of man without a predetermined essence; which in effect defeats the Christian thought of “essence before existence”. Sartre uses “exist” and “absence” to indicate how god does not determine the essence of his/her’s actions and instead man must deal with the absence of a higher being and discover that definition of themselves on their own, living life in abandonment.

The thesis of sociological functionalism is that recurrent social processes or events serve a function that is necessary to the maintenance of a social system. According to this thesis, it is important to analyze any social process or event in order to determine (1) whether it is recurrent, and, if it is, (2) the function of that process that is necessary to the maintenance of a social system. 

Several sociological functionalists identify deviance as a social process that is both recurrent and functions in a way that is necessary to the maintenance of a social system. They typically offer two types of arguments to support the claim that deviance is recurrent. The first depends on documented cases of deviant behavior; the sociological functionalist claims that there are enough of these cases to establish deviance as a recurrent social process. The second depends on the concept of society itself. Society is said to be (necessarily) constituted of different people with different ideas of what is good or right, and, as a result, when some people do things that they think are good or right, their actions will be deviant to others. To support the claim that deviance is necessary to the maintenance of social systems, sociological functionalists identify different functions of deviance and attempt to show that that function is necessary to the maintenance of a social system. I’ll leave it up to you (the student) to think of some functions of deviance that might....

Many children eat too many sweets and high-fat foods. There are plenty of people we could blame this on, but parents have the biggest impact on what their children eat. Society must evolve its current understanding and practice of what we should. If successful, parents would help increase our nation’s health by accurately communicating to their children which foods are healthiest.

First off, there are parents that are too passive about which foods their children eat. The main types of food that children eat are unhealthy foods like hot dogs, and macaroni and cheese. These types of parents feel that as long as their children are eating something that is not just sugar, they think that is good enough. But a well-rounded diet is important for their growth and their health so parents must be more assertive about their children’s diet.

But there are also parents that will do the opposite, and are too aggressive about their child’s diet and will try to force them into healthy eating. Most often, when children are continually forced to do something, they will rebel and do the opposite. So parents must be creative in order to help their children try new foods that are better for them. A good example is to add peanut butter and raisins to celery, so they think it is more of a treat or a game and encourages them to get used to the taste of celery. If eating healthier is turned into a game for children, parents will not have to be so aggressive about eating habits and the children will feel like they are choosing it on their own.

Additionally, children follow their parent’s bad example of unhealthy eating habits. Many parents do not research if they are getting the right nutrients or even if the food is good for them. So they will eat whatever tastes good and then both the parents and children suffer. Children look up to their parents, so if they ate more vegetables then their kids would be more likely to eat vegetables too. Parents should be leading by example to help their children.

A similar fault is that parents are not present to enforce healthy eating routines for their children. If a child gets home before their parents, they must find something to eat for themselves. This can lead to very bad choices that could be avoided. The best solution to this would be for them to inform their children the importance of eating well and create a meal routine so the children are used to eating the correct foods, and also buy less junk food so that option isn’t available. This will help program them to think of an apple as the first food to go for rather than cookies, so that children will make the correct diet choices without requiring a parent to be there.

Above all, the biggest communication error that parents and children face is receiving and providing incorrect information. We’ve been taught for many years that the food pyramid is the ideal guide to what we should eat in a day. But the recommended serving sizes are too broad to fit each person’s unique body. It states that we should eat 6-11 servings a day of bread, cereal, rice and pasta. These foods are very low in essential nutrients but greatly increases the amount of insulin in the blood which turns into body fat. The recommended serving size for the base of the pyramid should be greatly reduced and replaced with fruits and vegetables.

The food pyramid states that the recommended serving size of fruits and vegetables is about 2-5 servings per day. Most nutritionists believe this number is still too low, but that’s not even the biggest issue. The majority of people aren’t even meeting the suggested amount. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that “In 2010, the reported median consumption [for high school students] was 1.2 times per day for both fruits and vegetables”. This is below half the recommended amount. If we hope to increase our nation’s health we must adjust the food pyramid so that parents and children are getting the correct information about a suggested diet.

With this in mind, one of the biggest misconceptions about food is that we should eat as much meat as possible to provide us with enough protein. But most people are getting too much protein and not enough vitamins or fiber. Beans are a great alternative to meat, being high in fiber, and antioxidants that are not found in most meat products. Many nutritionists suggest to replace high-fat meats with leaner options, fish, and/or beans. This will lower obesity rates while increasing the amount of essential nutrients consumed. Many children face problems of obesity and other diseases that could be treated just by altering their diet.

Obesity rates have more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. Childhood obesity has led to around 1 in every 400 children being diagnosed with diabetes. Children with diabetes are at risk of having a heart attack at the young age of 30. This problem could be alleviated if parents would enforce a better diet to their children. Therefore, we must look towards a better food pyramid to follow. But since every person’s body is so unique, there isn’t a one size fits all pyramid to recommend. Age, weight, and activity level all play a big part in determining what the recommended serving sizes should be. So parents must do more research and decide which diet is best for their family.

In summation, if parents maintain these communication errors we will continue to see obesity and diabetes rates increase. Americans must change their eating habits, and parents are the most effective source for enabling this change. All parents should want to see their children be healthy and happy so we must make this a bigger concern for everyone’s welfare.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_1dd1y9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1dd1y9/my_first_college_essay_would_love_some_feedback/,

Dear XYZ Hiring Manager,

My name is Joe Schmo and I would like to be considered for your Sales/Marketing Assistant position.

I am a senior at Cool Dude University and will be graduating with a degree in Marketing and a minor in Spanish. One of the most important messages that has been ingrained into my mind during my academic career is to create a lasting business relationship. This is what I hope to do with XYZ.

Before I knew anything about marketing, I was designing websites using basic HTML and free image editing programs such as GIMP and Paint. At the time, all I was doing was using my newly acquired skill as a creative outlet. However, this creative outlet has evolved into a love for marketing. While some of my peers may view the Internet as solely a means of buying cheap goods and watching funny videos, I realize it is an integral business tool that is beneficial to all parties---developer, client, and end user.

I have held various positions which have fostered the growth of my skill set and given me life experiences that can not be learned in a classroom. Based on these experiences, travel, academic work, and bilingual communication skills, I believe that XYZ is an exciting organization where I can continue my development. As I develop, I am certain that my team-focused, positive attitude and emphasis on delivering fresh content will mark me as an essential team member who is dedicated to the growth of the company and it’s clients.

Thank you in advance for taking the time to consider me for the Marketing/Sales Assistant position. I can be reached at EMAIL or PHONE. I look forward to further discussing my qualifications and background with you.

We had to do a topic that is relavant to within the past few years. I choose whether or not evolution should be taught in public schools. Im looking for everything from gramatical errors, to content suggestions. Any help would be appreciated. 

Teaching evolution in public schools

     Evolution is a controversial topic that’s being thrown around a lot recently. The main way that it’s being tossed around is whether or not it should be taught in school. I'm here to tell you that of course evolution should be taught in school. In all honesty, why should it be? The pros highly out way the cons in nearly every sense. With the bounds of just this paper I can convince you that of course it should be allowed. 


    My first reason for why this should be taught in public schools is because of the main reason why people are against it; that reason being that it is insensitive to people of other beliefs. Well, that really isn't reason for it to not be allowed in schools. How is it, just because someone gets offended, we have to cater the entire system to what they think? Someone is always going too offended by everything that's ever said, ever. If you put this in another situation it’s going to look rather silly. Say that you're at a restaurant, and you order a dish that's gotten high praise in all its reviews from the best critics in the world. You order this very highly esteemed dish and you happen to not like it. In fact, you're so disgusted by this that you go to the chef and demand that the dish be taken off of the menu. Now, this seems like a rather irrational thing to do when you put it in a different light. There is quite an easy solution to putting evolution in public schools, and still having it is fair to people of other beliefs. That one way being simply teach creationism in public schools as well. You can allow the kids to make decisions for themselves rather than having them making ill informed decisions based on no premises. In all honesty, teaching evolution to public schools doesn't even interfere in anyone’s beliefs. It isn't science vs. religion; it’s not really even a contest. The two can easily coincide with one another. (Creationism vs.)  Now, taking this course of action would lead me to my next point, about curiosity. 


    Humans are naturally curious creatures; just by knowing that, we can tell that we are going to want to know about various things. I in fact have quote that I believe very heavily in; the passion to explore is at the heart of being human. “This impulse [referring to curiosity.] — to go, to see, to know— has found expression in every culture.”(Curiosity) The biggest one that I’d want to know about is my origin, or where I came from. That’s where we came about with all of these theories like religion, and evolution to simply explain how we came about and why we’re here. Now, tell me this, why would you want to take a class out of schools, that caters very well to answering that very question? Not just that, but it’s also widely accepted by literally almost every group that's relevant to modern society. In all honesty all that you're doing is taking away others opportunities to figure out for their own selves how they came about. 


    Evolution isn't just a theory anymore. The main problem that people have with evolution is that they don't think there's enough proof backing it up, that evolution is only just a theory. Well, to be honest that statement is simply false. There are other well established scientific theories as well that pretty much everyone has come to accept. Gravity is only a theory; however I don't see people lining up at the doors of high schools to have the theory of gravity taken out of the curriculum. Much like the theory of gravity, there is also overwhelming evidence that supports the theory of evolution. Everything from fossil records to biogeography the evidence is simply staggering. (MS cerqueira)   Ever since the days of Charles Darwin, scientists have been researching fossil and dating of layers of rock all leading up to today, where were fighting the battle of having evolution taught in public schools. 


    After all that has been said about evolution, I can imagine that you agree with me on the terms that yes, evolutions should be taught in public schools. Combined with the overwhelming evidence for the existence of it, and just the common sense required to say, yes animals would change to suit the needs of their environment, there is no reason not to agree with evolution.

It’s been almost a year since Britain hosted the most prestigious sporting even on the planet.  The Olympic Games promised to not let Britons forget about the importance of sport. This promise is being put to the test at this moment on fields, courts and sports halls across the country. 
Looking at the budget of the Department for     Culture, Media and Sports’ (D.C.M.S.) looking at the pre and post-Olympic Games budget we can see positive changes in the terms that the department’s budget increased with more than 50%. There are a number of factors that led to this       increase; one of them would be the success Team GB had during the games. Another factor was that $377m were saved out of the £ 9.298bn budget bringing the overall budget for the games down to £8.921bn.         


	Although Team GB excelled in sports such as Rowing, Cycling and Athletics, but poor performance  from sports such as Basketball, Wrestling, Water Polo or Handball showed that the D.C.M.S does not pay enough attention to less popular sports and fails to promote them enough. 

	I set out to find if the good overall performance of Britain changed the way the D.C.M.S. handles the formation of future athletes and the distribution of its budget. While having a discussion with a tutor from the Telford College Sports Academy I found out about a government funded program meant to find and help potential elite athletes in achieving athletic performance. The programme is an Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (A.A.S.E. pronounced “Ace”) and through it, students are prepared for a professional career in sports. To my surprising the programme framework was set up as early as 2004 but only came in effect with September 2010 following the general election and the instating of Hugh Robertson as the Minister for Sport.            

In the history of British basketball the national team had only two participations at Olympic Games 1948 and 2012, both times the team automatically qualified because it was a host nation. The team also debuted at FIBA EuroBasket in 2009 and then qualifying in 2011 ranking 13th both times.             

Telford College’s basketball AASE program allowed me examine the point of view of students that take part in it. Jonnas Dietrich, an 18 year old German born player is seen as having the most potential when it comes to his future in basketball. I sat with him during one of his training sessions to discuss his future and how he prepares for it.           

At 6 foot 3 inches he is not a tall player, but what he lacks in height he gains in accuracy and technique making him a good shooting guard for all 3 of the teams he plays for. Each week Jonnas has to divide his time between the Telford College A.A.C.E. team, the Under 18’s and the EBL (English Basketball League) Division 3 teams at Shropshire Warriors leaving him with only two days to relax, that’s if we exclude the fact that he is in full time education, studying A Levels in Biology, Maths and Father Maths at Wolgarston High School (Penkridge) and a BTEC in Sport at TCAT College in which case Sundays are the only days he gets to pursue his hobbies.           

Being in his second year of college, Jonnas has already applied for a spot at a Manchester University where he will pursue a degree in Maths while at the same time he will hopefully continue playing basketball for one of the local teams. During the interview he told me that “the main reason I picked Manchester is because of basketball”, Manchester being known for having a strong basketball scene.One might think Jonnas is unique in his ambition and dedication to sport but the truth is far from it, whilst assisting to the training I got the opportunity to talk to the rest of the players and I came to the conclusion that most of these players are prepared to sacrifice their free time in for a chance at a career in basketball.          

But what does a career in British Basketball mean for a young player that aspires to success? First of all, when compared to basketball outside the UK we see that the BBL fails to attract the attention of the public and that translates to a minimum of media coverage and a lot less interest from sponsors. If we look at their American counterparts we see that there’s a lot more money involved which increases the competitively and standards of the game, nowadays the NBA being considered the Mecca of basketball and the place where every basketball player wants to get to.             

There is a long way to go until Britain’s basketball team will be able to compete at the same level as other nations but by investing in youth programs as the A.A.S.E. As long as the funding will persist, there is hope that by the 2020 Summer Olympics Britain will have a top 5 team.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_1ccszr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1ccszr/is_there_a_way_to_get_proof_of_proofreading_for/,

&gt;The purpose of this study is to test whether or not the subject’s first written language affects the direction they will write in when given a second writing system.  This is important because it may show some form of the Language Transfer theory being applicable for written language, but this could also show that there is some importance to the direction that is written in.  The study was conducted using a constructed writing system that is designed to be used in any of six different directions at any given time.  Over the course of the study the various subjects used the constructed writing system in a wide array of directions, disproving that the Language Transfer theory really applied to the new writing system.  The results seemed to show that, had the constructed writing system been specifically adapted to the subject’s L1 they would have taken more liberty with which direction they wrote in overall.  This would show that writing directionality is purely a factor of the writing system’s design and is not based on internal reasoning.

It's a bit dramatized, but totally true. Hope you guys and girls enjoy and thanks in advance!


“Jack, you need to do this right if you want to pass your belt test next week,” I forced through my teeth, obviously frustrated. With a look of defeat on his face, Jack hoisted his weary body off the mat and jogged near me to attempt another somersault.  For weeks now, I had been working with Jack to perform a simple front roll, but his lack of ability only left me resentful towards the boy.  I did not care that he was eight, or overweight, or Autistic; all I saw was an unfit kid who was making me look bad in front of my new boss.  

Once again, Jack would try his hardest to thrust his legs over his head, only to flop on the mat like a fish out of water.  His lips quivering as if he was about to burst into tears, he came close to me and uttered, “I can’t do this, Instructor.” 

The look on his face suggested something more than a mere lack of ability. This pattern of failure was frequent in Jack’s life, as many conversations with his parents revealed to me.  His disability inhibited his capability to connect with his peers at school.  His relentless siblings were not completely understanding of his condition, and teased him because of it. Even at the dojo, Jack’s inability to match his teammates physically made him an outcast. In his mind, this was simply further proof that he was an inadequate person. 

Despite my previous dismay for Jack, his emotional plea urged me to encourage him more than I had ever done before.  I told him that if he wants to do a front roll, he must first picture himself succeeding in his mind. 

“If you can do that,” I told him, kneeling down to his level, “you can do anything”. 

I quickly saw something click in his head.  His demeanor turned from sorrow to conviction, and he kneeled down for another attempt. The expression on his face was one I had never seen before, one of confidence and determination. There was no way he would continue to fail. 

In one motion, he lunged forward, tucked his head, and rolled straight to his feet. Astonished and speechless, my eyes widened and jaw dropped as Jack turned to me with the most radiant smile on his face. He looked at me with eager eyes and said, “Was that right Instructor?”

The following week, Jack passed his belt test with flying colors. 

Many would say that I taught Jack how to do a somersault that day. While this may be true, Jack taught me something much greater.  He showed me what true dedication can allow us to accomplish. This was not just a front roll for Jack; this obstacle represented his daily struggle to compete with an unjust world. And for the first time in his young life, he won.

I have a massive writers' block at the moment so the following piece of writing will be awful. 

Memo:
AP US History Petition- Memo
	As a member of the Congressional Debate team, I find myself often turning back the clock and looking at past political developments within the United States. It seems as if the deeper I go within the US government, the more intriguing things seem to get. I’ve noticed continuities dating centuries ago, and I’ve discovered shocking developments. I’ve studied countless instances of foreign affair, the most interesting to me being our involvement in the Israeli-Palestine conflict, which is a very prevalent topic in the debate world. It seems as if my interest in history, particularly within the United States, didn’t reach a climb until my experience on the debate team. I found myself getting lost reading accounts of several historic events, my favorite being the accounts of Japanese-American internment, an often-overlooked piece of United States history.  Additionally, I have submerged myself within the art of diplomacy, seeing trends in foreign policy within the United States. Evidently, my historical interests have reached a climbing point this year. During my past studies in history, particularly in Western Civilization 9, I had not yet discovered my interest in the past, and obviously that took its toll on my grade. However, this year I am now putting in the extensive effort and actively reading because that interest is now present. When I saw that there was a possible option to take an AP US History course, I was thrilled. What better way to nurture my interests in United States politics than to challenge myself by taking what many juniors describe as “one of the most difficult courses” they have ever taken? The benefits here are innumerable – I will be improving my abilities regarding historical analysis and I will be immersing myself in a difficult curriculum filled with endless knowledge. The work I’m willing to put in is subjective, as it is with any course, but it shall be taking rise next year as I do plan on moving down to Accelerated math which frees up more time in my course-load. The difference with history, however, is that it is one of the few areas of study I actually enjoy. I often find myself participating much more in history class than I do in other courses and that is due to a genuine interest, as Dr. Thomas can attest to. I plan on obviously doing my very best to manage the course, hard work and a genuine desire to learn are included.
	There are courses in which I put in effort solely for the sake of academic success. History is not one of those courses. History is the type of course where I keep up with the reading, study each time period, and participate in class not for the sake of academic success, but to nurture my desire to learn something I am truly interested in. Sure, my grades may not be consistently stellar, but my desire to learn is consistent. This desire is why I think I can be successful, because it drives me to put in the necessary effort and it drives me to meet the course’s expectations and demands.

my problem is how do i create a thesis when the there are 3 questions for the essay?

Heres how i tackled my introduction: 


Initially, the foreign actors involved in Afghanistan were critical of creating a peace building mission in the country because of the major challenges that lay ahead, and the major responsibilities that they had to undertake, especially in the difficult conflict ridden area. There was an emphasis laid out by the United Nations (U.N) and its advisor to Afghanistan: Lakhdar Brahmi, about the importance of having a light international footprint in the country, to work on creating policies that were more ‘local’, to focus on state building, and to increase the power of the government. These policy making strategies were later abandoned as a result of the gross underestimation of the problems that existed, and the unwillingness of the U.S who spearheaded the entire foreign occupation, to be involved in the peace building process. This essay will examine the primary thought process that began when the foreign occupancy started, and how that approach in policy making later transformed as a result of the several factors discussed above. The failure of the foreign occupancy in Afghanistan can be attributed to the abandonment of the framework developed by Lakhdar Brahmi, which was the result of the unpreparedness of the international community involved. This essay argues that the process of policy making evolved greatly as the mission elapsed, and how the change in the approaches of policy making was catalyzed by

The sentence is:

Roman sat, quietly, in his seat, not giggling and chit-chatting, like the other kids from his school.

I believe that the commas setting off quietly are appropriate or not and depend on the meaning I am trying to convey. I am also quite sure that the comma before not is appropriate. If the sentence becomes:

Roman sat, quietly, in his seat, like the other kids from his school.

Then you lose the meaning of the sentence because the other kids were not sitting quietly. If you look at most examples of contrasting phrases that get set off by commas, you will notice that the meaning is not lost:

She will go to to school in New York, not Chicago, to study law. Excise the contrasting phrase, and: She will go to school in New York to study law.

As new technologies arise and new inventions are implemented, the prices of the corn we depend on lower substantially; but unfortunately, these faster and cheaper processes have a cost that does not come from our pocket but from our body. The use of the corn that has flooded America’s market has revolutionized the way Americans eat. We can consume more meat on a regular basis and a cheaper cost, we can choose much higher quality cuts at an affordable value, and we can even choose our meat based on its origin. But while we bask in the glory of our new meat filled diet, we fail to see the consequences of our actions. Most recently, the blame of America’s health problems has been put sugar filled treats or high fructose corn syrup and while those are contributing factors, there is another that lurks in the dark. There is another cause that does not want to be addressed because America does not want to eat less meat. The meat we are consuming is plagued with pathogens our body cannot fight and the cause of this can be directly linked to the cows we get our meat from. 

The price of corn is described best as a catch-22 of disastrous proportions. Because of the constant lowering of the price, farmers must grow more and more of the product each year. As a direct result, the price lowers the following year. This leads to a farmer having to grow more of the corn than the previous year. This unfortunate cycle has lead companies such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi Cola, Cargill, and many others to use this excess of corn to create a cheaper good. From an economic standpoint, these companies have created a pathway for innovation. They manipulate the cheapest ingredients available and create a highly demanded item. But from a dietary view, these companies are the worst thing to happen to mankind in some time. 

The most important of these economical geniuses is Cargill. This company has created a very inexpensive grain based feed for cattle that is used nationwide. Many industrialized cattle ranches use this cheap product in order to increase their profit. Once again, from an economic view, this is by far, the most logical decision. But the question of the ethicality is raised over this cheap feed. Since the manipulation of corn to fit the diet of cattle has been implemented, there has been a drastic increase of health issues in America. For some time this connection was not made simply because nobody ever thought to look at our cows for the source of our undoing.
	
	A cow’s digestive equipment consists of four compartments within a stomach. One in particular, which is called the rumen, is a part that contains various types of bacteria and fungi that help breakdown grass and hay. Millions of years of evolution have led this remarkable animal to digest copious amounts of grass and hay without a problem. But ironically, the stomach is where the problem for America lies because cows are unable to digest grains properly. Due to the fact that companies like Cargill have created a feed based on grain, there have been complications within the cow. Complications that have been associated with the health issues of America. When cattle consume grain, their stomachs are prone to creating a more acidic environment for the food to digest. During this process, nature allows E. coli to evolve rapidly enough to survive in this highly acidic stomach. As this newly made bacteria travels through the digestive system unharmed, it is expelled into the feces of the cow. In a slaughterhouse these feces can easily contaminate the meat of the cow. Under normal circumstances, the consumer can properly cook the meat and kill the bacteria. But for the person who enjoys their steak undercooked, this poses a serious risk. A cow’s stomach is less acidic that a human’s which leads any bacterium that contaminates the meat to be killed in our acidic stomach. But because E. coli has now evolved to survive in a higher acidity, it can survive within the stomach of a human and cause serious health problems.


	The excrement of cattle poses another serious risk to Americans in an unexpected way. When the cattle defecate at the ranch where they spend their lives, the feces decompose the way nature intended, on the land. But what nature does not intend is of what the manure is composed. To offset the diseases that run rampant within the extremely close living quarters of the cattle, the ranchers give cattle multiple antibiotics. The unabsorbed antibiotics in the cattle are expelled within the cow’s waste. These antibiotics are then decomposed with the feces into the land and through natural runoff, the

Ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure today that the City of London School’s philosophy society is able to present to you Mr Anthony Grayling, master of the New College of Humanities. In his academic career, Mr Grayling has lectured in philosophy at St. Anne’s College, Oxford, and has held a professorship at Birkbeck College, University of London. A prolific writer, Mr Grayling has penned and edited over thirty books ranging in scope from ethics &amp; liberty to realism and philosophical logic. His latest work, entitled The God Argument, which his website describes as ‘a statement of the humanist outlook that recommends itself as the ethics of the genuinely reflective person’ is released today. In addition to contributing to various newspapers and magazines, he also sits on the editorial board of several academic journals. Since June 2011 however, Mr Grayling’s efforts have been largely focused on his role at the New College of Humanities. An undergraduate college specialising in Economics, English, History, Law, Philosophy and Politics, the New College describes itself as ‘most exciting innovation in UK higher education for many years’. Without further ado, Mr A.C. Grayling.

1362932327.0,2,self.Proofreading,1a10bo,What I have done so far for my Sophomore research paper (Highschool),Mrunclesam,2,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1a10bo/what_i_have_done_so_far_for_my_sophomore_research/,"Polio is a disease which paralyzes your body, and can lead to death. At its peak in the 1940’s through the 1950’s, polio would kill and paralyze over 500,000 people worldwide every year. Starting in 1935, scientists began using monkey spinal cords to find a vaccine for polio. By 1957, the vaccine went public. The rates of polio in the United States dramatically dropped from 58,000 to just 5,600 cases annually. Now, in the United States, every infant is required to receive vaccines for polio. Today, there is practically a zero percent chance of getting polio if you got the vaccine. Without animal experimentation, we would still have polio in our country, and it would have continued to grow and affect people worldwide. Animal testing is using an animal (such as a rat, mice, monkeys, etc.) to test for discoveries like vaccines and treatments that might be dangerous to humans. More than 50 percent of animals used are mice, and almost 25 percent rats. It is estimated that there are 100 million vertebrates experimented on around the world each year. During the 1990’s the first clone, a sheep named Dolly, was created due to the spike of interest in animal testing. Due to ethical questions about animal testing, it has been slowly losing interest. People assume animal testing is unethical, without much knowledge on the subject. Groups such as PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) protest and try to stop the scientists from hurting the animals. They argue that it is not worth giving pain to the animals because they are innocent. Animal testing is not only for medical advancement, but is also used to make sure products are safe for humans before they are available for people to use. Examples are cosmetic animal testing, which is testing make up and other skin products on animals to make sure they do not cause harm. Animal experimentation has been used in the past to help treat or cure harmful diseases. If human lives could potentially be saved, then animal testing should be legal. Any harm done to an animal is worth the harm if doing so helps protect us.
	One of the main arguments against animal testing is that it is morally wrong, and that it is not fair to the animals. Law allows animals to be burned, shocked, poisoned, isolated, starved, forcibly restrained, addicted to drugs, and brain damaged (Peta n.p). The scientists behind animal testing are not purposely hurting the animals for no reason, but if we can save lives by hurting a couple animals, we should do so. Animals are harmed in the wild every day, but people don’t go picketing the animals that are using the other animals for prey, so why should humans be ridiculed for doing harm to the animals, but not for food, but for a good purpose? Next, “The public is led to believe animals in labs are treated well but accountability is minimal and public disclosure is non-existent” (Kavanagh n.p). If accountability is minimal, then how would we know how the animals are really treated? There is no way to know for sure how well the animals are really treated in the labs, but there are laws to make sure that scientists will not be unjust when in care of the animals. Lastly, 95 percent of animals used in experiments are not subject to the laws that help make sure the animals cannot be harmed, because the act excludes rats, mice, birds, and cold blooded animals (Peta n.p). Rats are pests which are the most common animal to experiment on, especially because most people do not mind rats being harmed or killed. If someone had a rat problem in their house, they would set up a trap to try and kill the rat, which is legal. So why would killing a rat for the purpose of advancement in medical research be illegal? Some people might view animal testing as morally wrong, but to many others, the reward is worth the sacrifice.
	Some might argue that animal experimentation is unnecessary, or that there are other ways to find cures, but without animal experimentation we would not have cures for diseases we have today. First, the human body is very complex; this is why animals aren’t good models to represent humans (Marston 34). Scientists have proven that chimpanzees are the closest related animal to humans, so if we were to test on any animal, it should be chimpanzees. Animal testing is the best solution to find cures for human diseases, and if there was any better way, we would not be animal testing. But that is not the case, so animal experimentation is the most efficient way. Second, money and animal lives are wasted (Kavanagh n.p). Just because an experiment didn’t get the exact results we wanted, doesn’t mean it was not worth it. The scientists doing the experiment still get really helpful information from every experiment they do, whether it achieved the main goal, or not. Kavanagh is not aware of the benefits that come with every single experiment. Third, a lot of animal experiments are not relevant to human health, and do not contribute to meaningful medical advances (Peta n.p). This statement by Peta is simply inaccurate. By law, any animal experiment has to be necessary for the health of humans. The animal testers cannot test on an animal for no reason, but that doesn’t necessarily mean every animal experiment is to advance human medicine. Many animals are tested on using cosmetics, to make sure that any product released will not harm humans. An experiment may not get the exact results we want, but the information gained is still very valuable. Last, biomedical and other animal research is currently funded through our tax dollars (Kavanagh n.p). Most people would rather have their tax dollars help advance medicine and human health than building a satellite that cost one hundred million dollars of our money that is not even being sent into space, and is sitting in storage that costs one million dollars per year, which is also being funded through our taxes. There are thousands of lives that have been saved because of information found through animal experimentation. Anyone who has been cured of their deadly disease because of a cure found through animal experimentation has been cured because of our tax dollars. Lives are priceless, and anyone saved, is money well spent. 		Animal testing protects humans against harmful chemicals that might be in cosmetics, helps find cures or vaccines for deadly diseases, and is necessary if we want to keep seeing advancement in medicine. First, animal experimentation has helped scientists find new ways to treat illness, improve overall health and well-being, and also extend life (Collins, n.p). Animal experimentation has increased the life expectancy of a person with cancer by over ten percent, and has created cures for twenty four significant diseases in the past thirty years.

These are in the body paragraph. What am I doing wrong?

In The Coldest Winter Ever, an example of pager communication is found in chapter 14. Bullet, Winter’s business associate; gives Winter a pager to be used for communication: “Here, take this.” He handed me the pager. “You gonna see how serious a nigga is. Learn how to respect a man when he talks. I’ll page you when I finish setting up. Seeing is believing. You’ll see. My code is 000.” He hugged me again. “You gonna be mines.” Without Bullet giving Winter a pager, the business intentions of Bullet would have been non-existent. Towards the end of the book, Bullet uses the pager as a way to communicate with his network of Winter and is able to execute business operations that involves the profit of money. The ghetto neighborhood is diverse in business opportunities; communication plays an important role for businesses to flourish. Hierchy is the last element that surrounds the ghetto neighborhood, a business in the ghetto neighborhood must have a hierchy.

The Coldest Winter Ever provides an insight as to what a hierchy in a business is like; there are chapters that provide exemplified descriptions of hierchy. The ghetto neighborhood is a very hostile environment and when a business is founded in a well strung hierchy; the elements of money, networking and communication excel to flourish the business. With hierchy, there is power and loyalty. Power is what Santiaga uses for his business; power in the ghetto neighborhood provides a solid heirchy for the business, power is the amount of influence a business has in the ghetto neighborhood.
In the case of Santiaga, the ghetto neighborhood is tolerant of businesses involving Santiaga. The power in which Santiaga holds is very influential and it is also stated in The Coldest Winter Ever that Santiaga knows power provides hierchy for a business. “He said that a man gotta carry a powerful presence in his neighborhood so the small-timers didn’t start itching with takeover fever. Now it was like we was cutting out. So I did something that I normally would not do. I questioned Santiaga.” This statement was introduced in chapter 1, Santiaga was describing how a business needs a powerful presence. With power comes loyalty, networks of friends and family will be respectful or fearful in a business, loyalty provides a foundation for hierchy.

### Poem here
&gt; Sharon Olds ""rites of passage""

&gt;As the guests arrive at my son's party 
they gather in the living room-- 
short men, men in first grade 
with smooth jaws and chins. 
Hands in pockets, they stand around 
jostling, jockeying for place, small fights 
breaking out and calming. One says to another 
How old are you? Six. I'm seven. So? 
They eye each other, seeing themselves 
tiny in the other's pupils. They clear their 
throats a lot, a room of small bankers, 
they fold their arms and frown. I could beat you
up, a seven says to a six, 
the dark cake, round and heavy as a 
turret, behind them on the table. My son, 
freckles like specks of nutmeg on his cheeks, 
chest narrow as the balsa keel of a 
model boat, long hands 
cool and thin as the day they guided him 
out of me, speaks up as a host 
for the sake of the group. 
We could easily kill a two-year-old, 
he says in his clear voice. The other 
men agree, they clear their throats 
like Generals, they relax and get down to 
playing war, celebrating my son's life.

Help a homey out? Thanks!


Well, hello there, []. We finally meet. Sort of.

 I know you don’t know me, but I know you know about me. I don’t even have to say who I am. For whatever reason, you seem to have made it your life’s goal to destroy my relationship with []. I get how difficult it can be to move on from a previous relationship. I experienced a pretty devastating divorce before [] and I started dating. Sometimes it’s heartbreaking and shattering. You really have my sympathies. As much as I’d like to befriend you and understand where you’re coming from or help you with whatever difficulties you’ve had in your life, you’ve created a situation that will have dire consequences for either you, or me. Either way, I’m going to break a few things down for you:

1.	[] is my fiancé. He’s not a guy I’m dating, he’s not a casual fuck buddy, he’s not a friend with benefits; HE asked ME to marry him, to spend the rest of my life with him. Most people would realize that indicates he wants to be with me, because, DUH.
2.	I am pregnant with []’s child. I don’t sleep around, but don’t pass judgment on those who choose to do so, so long as those spreading their legs aren’t attempting to wrap them around someone who is in a committed relationship. As an aside, I’d also hope that if someone chose to have multiple sexual partners, they’d at least try to be safe and clean about it, if not at least honest.
3.	Regardless of whatever proclivities you have regarding digitally distributing your inner labia (that *would* be solely your business had you sent your twat to someone who wanted it, was single, and was the only one with access to the phone it was sent to), I would hope you’re smart enough to realize if you send a picture of yourself in the midst of passionate, gynecological exploratory adventures (I’m sure it was for science class, right?), that I’ve seen it along with the rest of the proof you have a vagina, and I’m probably not the only one other than [] who has.
4.	[] is not with you. [] is not going to be with you. In any capacity. [] is not going to someday decide to stick his dick in any of your orifices. This is something you really need to start letting go of.
5.	If you have an issue with me, act your age and talk to me like an adult. You aren’t in high school where ‘normal’ might be to attempt to plant seeds of doubt everywhere you can, in hopes of turning people against the girl you so deeply envy. The jealousy is obvious. Why else would you be so hell-bent on badmouthing me and my relationship with [] to people who love us?

I really have a lot of pity for you. There is a small part of me that feels sympathy for you because you have to know how pathetic it is to literally bombard someone with self-stills and self-shot videos of your masturbatory skills, and still be a failure. You are a beautiful young woman on the outside. You’re charming, charismatic, and from the good things I’ve heard about you (which, I have to be honest, have been fleeting at best), you’re a very motivated young woman. I can see that you work very hard to get what you want. There is a point, however, when defeat is literally raping you down the throat, that it’s time to stop trying. Seriously.

Look in the mirror. Do you like who you see? Do you feel pride knowing that, if in the non-existent chance you succeeded, you would be breaking up a family? Yes, [] and I have a baby on the way, but I also have a daughter that fell in love with this man. Would you feel satisfied in destroying that relationship too, or are you just that sociopathic and selfish that you don’t care? I know as a young person it doesn’t always occur to you how your actions will affect others. Because you can’t seem to see that on your own, I’m showing you.

 It doesn’t take a single iota of effort to manipulate others into getting them to do what you want. It does take quite a bit of strength and humility to realize something you’ve done is completely out of line, and if your family and friends knew what you’ve been doing, that they’d be as disgusted with you as you should be. This is real life. There are real consequences for actions. Maybe you’ve successfully intimidated or weaseled and lied your way out of ever having to pay for your actions before (outside, of course, of the gifts you have that keep on giving), but I’m done with your trash. I’m done allowing you to think your efforts are getting you anywhere. If you think you’ve made any headway with [], [], [] or any of his other friends, you’re sorely mistaken. None of them have any respect for you, and because of the way you limply throw around your body like a used heroin needle, none of them want to touch you either.
 
This is the only courtesy I’m giving you; this is a one-time offer: 

Stop. NOW.

I take ABSOLUTELY no issue with making all of this public, AND I MEAN ALL OF IT. I don’t care what your reasoning is, I no longer care to understand what happened to you as a little girl that would psychologically shape you into thinking it’s a good idea to fuck with my family just to get some ass. I don’t even care what you’re trying to accomplish, because I don’t even think YOU know.

 Whatever skeletons you think you may know about that might provoke you into thinking you can spit fire as revenge, just keep in mind who has acted in the wrong here. Which one of us has done damage, and which one of us has suffered from the selfish stupidity of the other? Please don’t think I’ll take any threats lightly, whether they be direct or indirect; I’m stomping that fire out before there’s any attempt to light it.


 Stop acting like a spoiled little brat. You simply can’t have what you want this time, and you’re just going to have to get over it. Grow up dear, and join the rest of us adults in reality. You have a real opportunity to compose yourself, regain some self-respect and dignity, and learn from this. You don’t have to continue acting like a classless tramp. You can decide to be a woman that deserves respect, love and loyalty. Perhaps if you decide to take my advice, you’ll come to an instance later on in life where you’ll be grateful someone called you out on this so you could change your ways. Think of it as a forced epiphany. This is a chance for you to become a better person. 

Or, you can continue doing what you’ve always done, learn absolutely nothing, and end up with a restraining order filed against you.  Whatever you decide to do, keep it far away from my family. 

We are done with you.

**[Prompt #2]: What ethical principle do you find most applicable to the duties of a baccalaureate prepared nurse?**
_______

Author Catherine Pulsifer said, ""We are accountable for our decisions in our personal life, so why shouldn’t we be just as accountable in our work life.” Accountability overall is a principle that improves the humanity of society, and if a nursing student doesn’t feel accountable for their actions, they won’t feel accountable for their patients once they become a nurse. Accountability is the most applicable principle for a nurse to have instilled to be able to preform their job well and avoid ethical issues. All ethical issues may be attributed to a low principle of accountability. Ethics stretch across a multitude of nursing issues and responsibilities. Nurses must be accountable for maintaining patient confidentiality. They must provide accurate up to date information for their patients. Nurses need to be responsible for their own attitude while at work or in public, and need to feel responsible for the overall quality of care they provide. A major role of being a nurse is alleviating any unnecessary fear and insecurity from the patients and their family with reassurance, yet in my time working as a CNA I was appalled at the amount of neglect, negligence and abuse that the CNAs and one nurse I worked under preformed to ""deal"" with memory care patients. The issue simply is that there are a lot of nurses that don’t feel accountable to their patients. They come into the room of a patient and add to the patient’s distress by being interpersonally blank in their work. Sadly, I've seen and heard of many nurses that simply perform all the skills they're required to do, and then sit around in the facility or hospital on their phone actively avoiding patients and disregarding what I see as the most important aspect of the job. Accountability also encompasses the work ethic of a nurse; for a nurse to succeed in their job, they need to be accountable for their punctuality, responsibility, and commitment to their training, if they desire to preform their role as a nurse appropriately. The issues of having nurses that feel no accountability for their level of professionalism or in the interactions with their patients is incredibly detrimental for the quality of care those patients will receive, and will create ethical dilemmas. In the end nurses without a high principle of accountability will create adverse affects on the public’s impression of the entire nursing profession and their role in healthcare.

Once upon a time, in a realm far away from our own, lived a foul creature named Varsnor.
Varsnor had once been no different from an elf, and had lived as one, until his banishment from Vielsnor, so many winters ago.

He now ruled the dark swamps of Morgana, ruling over the land and the Bog People native to the swamps.
Varsnor was a vengeful ruler, he didn’t see his minions as living creatures, and therefore treated them worse than flies.

The Bog People had tried to overturn Varsnor many times, the rotten bodies just outside of his castle told the story of how they had failed, just as many times as they had tried.

The day our story starts was nowhere close to being an ordinary day.
The sun had yet to rise, and not even the guard dogs at the city borders where awake, but not everyone was asleep.
Varsnor met with seven of his most trusted riders, in his utmost private chamber.

Varsnor looked nothing like his minions, he was tall, lightskinned though it had darkened much from the dark powers siffoning through his lands, his ears where long, eyes were large, and his mind was sharp as a sword of steel.  

Next to him the riders, all members of The Bog People, were nothing but skin and bones, small, black skinned and stupid to say the least.
Fear however bound these creatures together in awe of their ruler Varsnor.

Still before the sun had risen, the riders rode out from The Castle of the Bogs, home of Varsnor.
They rode for many moons, desperately trying to outrun the dark forces of the swamps, while striving to get to Vielsnor before the men returned from harvest.

After seven moons the ground beneath them finally hardened, and the dark purple skies started lighting up.
They had finally reached Vielsnor, home of the light.
Not long after, did they reach the farm lands of Vielsnor, where so many men where working hard to harvest the crops, they left their Vargs, large wolf-like creatures, behind and ran, hidden in the high grass.

The elves of Vielsnor were no common men.
They could smell the scent of the Bog People from more than a miles distance, and the riders knew that.
They made sure to stay in the right direction of the wind at all times, and would throw themselves in the mud beneath them the second they felt the wind change.

After much running and even more hiding they finally made it to the farms of Christjorn, as expected the farms where unguarded, filled with women and children playing and singing, all in all, a very easy target.

Scream where heard all the way out to the farmlands, screams of death and pain.
When the men returned there was nothing left.
The houses where burned down, animals killed and so many elves dead, mutilated and some even half eaten.

And one young girl, Gar’wen a mere farmers daughter, was nowhere to be found, many nights spend looking for her, before they finally gave up.

It was not until the 13 High Elves of Vielsnor came to witness the tradgedy, that hope was restored.

History

                                   Absolutism V.S. Democracy
	Democracies are forms of government in which the people hold all of the power. An absolute monarchy is the opposite in which one person is given all of the power. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries there were lots of ideas going around about the freedom of people, socially, economically and politically. This time period was known as the Enlightenment. The philosophers in this time period had a great belief that all people should be equal, so they pushed for democracies. A democracy was the better type of government during the Enlightenment time period for several reasons.

	One advocate of democracies was John Locke. John Locke wrote in Two Treatises on Government that “by nature all free, equal, and independent, no one can be… subjected to the political power of another without his own consent.” By this quote John Locke is saying that nobody should ever be forcibly placed under the control of another person without said person’s consent. To do so was to strip people of the natural rights that all of mankind is entitled to. By saying this, John Locke is saying that there can be no government that the people don’t accept, and that one of the only governments the people will accept is a democracy.

	Montesquieu believed that people were entitled to a certain amount of fairness, that they could not be provided if they were under a monarchy. In an excerpt from The Spirit of the Laws Montesquieu says “There can be no liberty where the executive, legislative, and judicial powers are united in one person or body of persons, because such concentration is bound to result in arbitrary despotism.” When Montesquieu says this he means that having one person or body control a government is too dangerous due to the many conflicts of interests the ruling entity and the people can have. These conflicts can be anything from making money, to keeping power. Montesquieu says that he dislikes absolutism, which since he only gives a list of three governments, two of them ruled by one person or one small group of people, he supports democracies.

	King Louis XIV of France of course has a view that monarchies are the best type of government. King Louis XIV expressed that “The head alone has the right to deliberate and decide, and the functions of all the other members consist only in carrying out commands given to them.” While this view makes sense from a cursory glance, if you give it any real thought you can discount it. Even if you just look at the human body, there are several instances where the mind has no say in what happens with your body. One of these mindless instances is muscle memory. If something happens and you react right away, your muscle moves without having gotten any information from the brain. Putting this back into that metaphor, King Louis’s body would end up quickly betraying itself.

	Democracy is the best type of government during the Enlightenment period. Not only did a democracy give all people equal rights in a political manner, it also ensured that they were equal to a standpoint of what rights people had.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_1891rv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1891rv/history_absolutism_vs_democracy_essay/,

 ____________________
 

Ever since I was young I had a strong loving spirit and desired to help people in need. I simply wanted to be there for anyone that needed emotional support. I always felt emotionally compelled to be nurturing and help people grow, yet I wanted to be able to be helpful in a more physical way. With this, I grew up knowing I wanted to pursue a study in health and medicine. Anatomy and physiology classes I took at the Santa Rosa Junior College exploded my curiosity towards the human body and the nursing profession. I became a certified nurse assistant following my semester in anatomy to see if nursing is where I truly belonged. Once I began to have the experience working with nurses as a CNA I quickly knew I had made the right decision. The challenging nature of the career and life-long learning experience would allow me to continuously thrive and keep me satisfied with my work. The technical knowledge that nurses learn while able to have more patient contact and be in a position to be an advocate for people in need fit precisely with my ideal career. 
 
The contribution I wish to make for nursing is to improve the quality of care wherever I am by being a source of inspiration for patients and the team treating them. I hope to be a role model for the nursing profession and increase the acceptability and diversity of men in a female dominated career.  I've heard and seen nurses lose a piece of their humanity after working for a while and become unable to be there for their patients emotionally. To me out of all the qualities a good nurse requires besides the common ones like selflessness, and compassion is that a nurse truly requires resilience if they will persevere. For when everything seems like a constant series of unfortunate events, or when feeling frustrated with another difficult patient, the recollection of why we go down this path is necessary.

My daily contribution at work and school is too uplift the spirits of all people I come contact with.  I feel it is the nurses responsibility to never allow the patients to see if your having a bad day as good role models of care, smiles, and a positive attitude go a long way in the hospital setting.  When I witness the lack of care for patients in many facilities due to  sheer laziness or from the loss of empathy of some nurses and CNAs troubles me deeply. Neglect is a horrific  issue and as a part of who I am, I could never allow myself to not retain the patients and their family  as my first and foremost responsibility. A nurse must take care of their faculties and emotional stability in order to be ready for work everyday.  I know I posses the potential to have the resilience necessary to become a successful nurse for the long haul. Their would be no regret by anyone making this decision if I was to be included in the Dominican University Nursing Program beginning fall 2013.

Prompt:
&gt;Please describe how you became interested in this topic and any experiences that you believe have prepared you to undertake this project. You should also discuss how your research project relates to your graduate school, professional school, or career goals.



.



My history with physics is a long and developed one. I have wanted to be a scientist since the age of three, which is attributable to many weekends my father would spend teaching me about math &amp; science- stars, machines, anatomy, evolution, geometry, and chemistry. This instilled curiosity did me well over the years, but I can remember the defining moment when I decided to become a physicist. In 7th grade my math teacher, Mr. *Padaddle*, one day brought in a PBS special on string theory. It was a powerful experience for me as a child to learn about how my own reality was seemingly held together by some little-known magic; but the magic was real and I could devote my life to studying it. Following this experience I began dedicating my time to reading more about math and physics. On multiple occasions I notably turned down new clothes for math books. I eventually graduated high school at the age of 16.

.

Under some poor advice I believed that a degree in physics was a foolish endeavor, and spent my first few years at university soul searching in the sciences. I learned a lot about what I liked, and my tastes matured into contemporary topics. After some courses in chemistry I realized I was fascinated by large-scale behavior of systems and how the interactions of each and every molecule can change the course of a reaction. I soon joined a chemistry lab under Dr. *Sadadlle* where I was privileged to learn about programming for the first time. I quickly grew found and respectful of the power of computation. I eventually joined the ranks of the physics &amp; applied math departments and began a wonderful journey into classical and quantum mechanics which have only further affirmed my desire to become a physicist.

.

I took my first class in Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with Dr. *Madaddle* last spring. It was an eye-opening experience and I soon realized that I loved the theory of PDEs and using them to model all kinds of physical systems. He noted my enthusiasm and asked me to join his research group here at *UUU*. I was advised to take some very informative classes such as Numerical Analysis, Linear Algebra and Complex Analysis to prepare me for the math I would deal with. Dr. *Madaddle* soon introduced me to Condensed Matter physics, specifically Bose-Einstein Condensations which I epiphanatically realized was the end-all convergence of all of my interests. Condensed matter physics is the poster child of quantum mechanics in the sense that If you enjoy the theory, then this is the contemporary application of the subject. BECs are a many-body problem, which is fascinating to me. (needs wrap-up)

.

My hope is that the experience I gain working on this project will prepare me for graduate studies and beyond -- especially in condensed matter physics. Research experience is at a premium in my field, especially in the domain of competitive theoretical work. All experiences I have now will pay off in the future for me.

Begin writing your summary by introducing the author and title of the chapter and using the overview or main point you reduced to one or two sentences. Summarize all main ideas in your own words. If you like a phrase or sentence the writer has used, incorporate it as quoted material into your sentences. For example: Conroy declares, “children are stupid compared to adults,” when he is ordered to walk to the store in subzero weather.

6. Keep in mind that what you are trying to capture is each main point, but be careful not to try to paraphrase every sentence or generalize to three or four sentences. You want to discuss all main points and follow up with examples.

7. Be sure to quote the author a couple of times to support an idea you are making or to provide the flavor of the writer’s style. Introduce all quotes that are not incorporated into your sentences. Never open a sentence with a quote. Instead, use a verb such as “says,” “states,” or “explains” with a comma before the quote. For example: Coontz provides an example that says, “most Americans in the 1800’s. . . .” Don’t use the word “that” before a quote.

8. Be sure to represent the piece of writing fairly and objectively. Don’t distort what the writer has said, and don’t pass judgment on it by offering what you approve or disapprove of what the author has said. 

9. You can make a universal point in the summary, or you can save that for the reaction.

10. A reaction paragraph follows the summary. In the reaction, you can give your own views, thoughts, parallels, personal examples, and so forth.  You can agree or disagree with the author and say why.

This is my first time, so excuse any mistake in formalities. Introducing myself, I am a Freshman Engineering student, so English isn't my forte. However, I enjoy writing as it is a way of expressing myself.

If you could please help me. Below is the last e-mail I've sent him. I've been trying to work with this guy all day.

Dear Professor's name here,

I would like to enroll in CHEN 4502W for this next semester, but I have not completed the prerequisite course CHEN 4401W and will not be registered for this course until the fall of 2013. However, I have completed the prerequisite course CHEN 4501W last semester.

If I am unable to attend CHEN 4502W this upcoming semester I will not be able to graduate until the spring of 2014 rather than the fall of 2013 because this course is only offered in the spring.

If I am required to attend the 2014 spring semester, I will only be taking CHEN 4502W. This means that I would be spending more money on tuition and my graduation would be delayed by a semester.

I would like to point out that I am attempting to take CHEN 3401W next semester.  I have taken this course before, but was unable complete with a passing grade due to several stressful circumstances that arose during that semester. While I am not certain this would be a determining factor in the decision to allow me to take CHEN 4502W, I feel that it is worth mentioning.

Thank you for your time,
My Name

1354681149.0,2,self.Proofreading,14azgw,Revise AP literature essay.,Gxfire,2,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/14azgw/revise_ap_literature_essay/,"Her is my essay that i wrote in 40 minutes based on the short story ""Birthday Party"" by Katharine Brush. Can someone take a look at it and make revisions to it? I have until tomorrow to revise this for a better grade. Thanks :)


   “Birthday Party” is a short story about a woman who surprises her husband with a birthday cake and song during their dinner. The man is embarrassed as he is the center of attention in the restraint. When everyone settled back down he turned on his wife and made her cry. Although this is a short story, it has a good amount of diction and details.

   The Tone of the first paragraph is very relaxed and neutral. The author uses a couple abstract words, like banquette, but otherwise uses simple vocabulary. There are many commas used in the sentences that support the compound sentences that the author uses. The paragraph that follows suit is much like the first. The point of view is still unclear, but the story gets more details in this long, compound sentence. The author capitalized occasion in the middle of a sentence to show emphasis and specialty.
 
   The third paragraph changes tones and becomes happy and joyous. The details of the setting make the reader feel as if they were in the restaurant sitting next to the couple. Again, the vocabulary is simple with an abstract word, like indignant, thrown in. The sentences in this paragraph are long and compound, almost like run on sentences. There is little to no poetic devices in these paragraphs. The author’s writing style is very simple and straight, to the point.

   Finally, the fourth paragraph pulls it all together as the reader learns the point of view is first person told by a person at a table close to the couple. The tone shifts for the last time to sorry and grief. The sentences are still long and compound , the only consistency in her writing. The first sentence is informal as it brings the reader more into the story by sating “you” and “you thought.” There is alliteration, specifically consonance, in the last sentence. She uses the word “gay” to describe the woman’s hat, but it feels out of placed and misused.

   Overall, the point of the story was to show how even the kindest of acts can be show down by unappreciative people. The end of the story could also imply domestic abuse between the husband and wife. A gentleman would never make a woman cry in public place and pretend like it was nothing, especially after the surprise she gave him.

Don't worry about my citations, unless they are in the wrong place.  Feel free to suggest a title, and rip it to shreds!


Race in Television
	How race is dealt with on television and in film has been and still is a major issue today.  In Friday Night Lights, “Blinders,” the focus is on how each race perceives and reacts to a racist comment made by one of their coaches.  What makes this episode stand out from so many others that deal with race is that it makes racism the focal point of the episode, and brings conflict to the forefront.  “Blinders” shows race in a positive way, allowing viewers to see both sides of the coin, and opening up the possibility for thought coupled with the viewpoint that there is no answer to the issue of racism.
	This Friday Night Lights episode portrays race in a positive way by giving multiple views of life in a rural Texas town as an African American.  It uses a somewhat multiculturalist view, with a specific focus on the running back, Brian Williams and his family.  A multiculturalist discursive practice shows a complex perspective of African American life in Texas, in this case (Gray).  However, “Blinders” is more of a hybrid than anything else.  Multiculturalist shows tend to address the issue of race as something that must be dealt with.  In this case, the controversy is left open-ended for the viewer to interpret.  
A key segment of the episode is shown in a positive light when Brian’s mother is considering buying a big new house for the family.  However, as the tension in the locker room over the question of race grows, Brian’s mother’s loan from the bank for the house is retracted.  When Brian’s mother brings up the possibility of the withdrawal being because of race, combined with the tension in the football team, it proves to be too much for Brian, and he starts yelling at the banker.  These two scenes directly contrast and show both the highs and lows of a middle class African American family living in a typically racist state or town.  This is a positive because it doesn’t give a slant one way or another, or directly come out and say why the loan was withdrawn.  It simply ponders the idea that it could be a result of the family that is trying to get the loan.  Racism in determining who does or doesn’t get a loan is illegal, and is a very touchy subject.  The show purposely introduces this aspect of race, even though it does not have to do with football or the school, simply because it is a open-ended subject, and the show aims to make the viewer think about the issues that come along with racism, rather than assume what some African Americans have to deal with.
	In the locker room, the players argue back and forth over how serious the comments by the assistant coach should be taken, and what consequences the coach should face for his comments.  The episode portrays both sides of the argument, showing why some of the white players believe that the black players should not take the comments so seriously, and conversely, the black players reacting angrily to the comments.  By bringing up and equally covering both sides to the debate, possibly granting more time to what Brian thinks, the show gives the audience the power to see how each race is thinking, and giving them the power to choose who they think is right or wrong, and see the reasoning for what each side does as a reaction to the comments.  “Blinders” also shows the thoughts of the students about the issue of race more than it does the adults.  This perspective is not often used in film, and it lets the show connect to teenage viewers, who made up much of Friday Night Lights’ audience at the time (TIME).
	Another explanation of why this episode of Friday Night Lights portrays the issue of race in a positive sense is that it is more of a broadcast show, meaning it is focused at a wide range of people, rather than a specific niche (NOTES).  The show was aired on NBC, a nationally broadcast network.  The creators know that the show is being broadcast on to millions of people, of varying ethnicities and ages.  Therefore, the director uses his show to bring up the issue of race, and let people know that it is still an issue in the modern day.  Broadcast shows have the unique ability to act like billboards in a way also.  In this case and episode, Friday Night Lights is able to show the issue of race without taking a side.  This is important because it allows the audience to make the decisions, while the show itself portrays the image, similar to a billboard.  It is very useful for the producers of the show not to take a side, because of the nature of the subject.  In a cynical sense, it open-ended shows with deep issues such as this tend to get talked about and shown much more often than other episodes of the same series.  However, that is not to say open-ended issues are all used in a cynical sense.  These type of issues allow the director to make a point about important subjects in real life, and prove the point that sometimes there is no right answer.
	In the episode, there is one scene that sets the tone for what is to come.  When Brian’s girlfriend tells him, “I know you’re dealing with a lot right now, and I’m here for you, but sooner or later, you’re gonna have to peak out from behind those blinders.”  This comes after the assistant coach makes a rather weak apology for his comments.  Brian’s girlfriend expects him to take great offense to this, yet Brian largely ignores whatever has been said.  The ‘Blinders’ statement has a dual purpose.  It serves as an attempt to shake both Brian and the spectator, or the audience, of the show (Notes) – no matter what ethnicity, social class, or gender they are.
	This Friday Night Lights episode is more of a show about African Americans than it is an African American show (Notes).  The difference between the two is that an African American show would be produced predominantly by African Americans, and Friday Night Lights is produced mostly by whites (IMDB).  Also, “Blinders” deals with race relations between whites and blacks, features only a few African American characters, and has a presumed majority of white spectators – characteristics that match that of a show about African Americans.  This does not, however, mean that there will be a negative connotation associated with the show in question.  In this case, the director is actively exploring the subject of race without placing any judgment of his own into the show.  By being unbiased, “Blinders” allows the spectator to make their own decisions on a touchy subject, therefore showing race in a positive sense.
	Overall, “Blinders” shows the issue of race in a positive sense.  By leaving the issue open-ended, it allows the spectators to make a decision on what they do and do not believe.  Despite the majority of the “Blinders” portraying race in a positive manner, I believe that the fighting and eventual abandonment of the team by the African American players was just a tad over exaggerated and over dramatized.  However, being a mainstream television show, it is hard to have a perfect mix of drama and reality with the demands of the modern spectator.  “Blinders” acted as a fantastic way of introducing a tough issue, and leaving it an open one for thought.  This Friday Night Lights episode represents the reason why touchy issues such as race should be left open for thought.  The audience, not the director, should determine the solutions to these types of issues.

I have always been a weak writer, or maybe I should say that I am weak at organizing my thoughts and and writing down what I want to say. I am just paranoid because writing is so subjective, and I always have teachers that either love or hate my writing. It has really hurt my confidence in it. 

Anyways, to the point lol. I have a philosophy of education essay due that has to be 5 pages long, and I am having trouble with the whole thing. The topic seems so much and so vague. I feel overwhelmed. It is like three different topics that should be meshed into one. 

But my question is, would it be alright to start off the essay with a story of a bad experience from a rotten teacher I had to back up my philosophy for my thesis statement? Would that make the introduction too long? Or should I just put it in my first body paragraph? And hopefully I can have it up on here soon after the holidays if someone would like to give me a good, healthy dose of criticism. Thanks!

Some argue that it is unethical to carry out military actions from a computer screen. That we shouldn't be able to decide the fate of another human being from a map on a Google earth type program from an office hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Some also argue that drone aircraft will make it easy for police and investigative agencies to “watch” over us in our daily lives. All drones share a common detail; they are flown remotely from the ground by a controller and can carry vast amounts of expensive sensors and equipment. They come in many sizes too, some can be as small as a humming bird that utilizes the latest in nanotechnology, and others can be as big as a charter flight. There are a lot of facts that support the use of drone aircraft; they bring lives off the front lines, they are cheaper to operate then other manned aircraft, and that they open up job opportunities in new markets and trades never seen before. Drones or UAVs can stay in the air much longer then manned aircraft. The requirement of a constant flight crew can be eliminated from the equation, thus giving them a hypothetical infinite amount of time that they can remain in the air. Drone use in the civil marketplace is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Examples of civil applications include law enforcement, border patrol and emergency relief. (Finn) (Samkov) Anyone who is interested can build a basic UAV for around $1000 USD, out of balsa wood, plastic, a basic GPS unit, hobby R.C. parts and if the user desires to fly it out of range, a small video transmitter. This not only can be used as a way to inspire the imagination, but also a way to support small business and promote economic growth. (Finn)
A UAV can be defined as an aircraft fit for flight, that doesn't require an on-board flight crew. They are usually preprogrammed to fly autonomously, or are remotely piloted via a computer set up, or ground operator. They utilize different methods to take off, some use the latest in mobile launch platforms, while others will use the classic runway at an airport or in some cases a dirt road. Design engineers must take into account the payload to be carried for that drone's application. The airframe must be large enough and strong enough to carry not only the power plant and control apparatus' but also any cameras, sensors, any other information gathering equipment, as well as any weapons if the application requires it. Drone aircraft share the same flight systems and fly similarly to manned aircraft. The design calls for; a fuselage to carry the equipment, power plant to provide thrust, wings to create lift, ailerons to control roll, elevators to control pitch up and down, a rudder to control left and right movement, and flaps to slow the aircraft while on approach. (Finn)
It seems that UAVs have just appeared on the international playing field in the past fifteen years. But in reality, the history goes back to 1915. The US Navy developed a prototype cruise missile built into the chassis of a WWI biplane. It was designed to fly to a target and then dive into it. They never saw the light of day and never made it out of the prototype phase. During the Second World War, remote controlled modified aircraft were used for target practice as well as basic reconnaissance missions. In the 1990's, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as (DARPA), as well as NASA began to research modern applications for drone aircraft and some well-known platforms resulted from this effort such as the Helios, Proteus, Altus Pathfinder and Predator. During the Gulf War drone strikes were so effective Iraqi soldiers began associating the sound of a single engine prop plane with an imminent strike- leading to the first instance of humans surrendering to a robot. Currently more than 50 nations use drones for military and civilian purposes. 
Most large drones such as the Predator drone, flown by NATO forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, are controlled by pilots working in shifts thousands of miles away at an American air force base. The British drone HERTI, or High Endurance Rapid Technology Insertion, made by BAE is an example of a drone that can be programmed to fly its mission and land entirely autonomously. Some smaller drones can be remotely flown from the ground in a similar fashion to RC hobby planes. They don’t even need a line of sight for the operator, as they can stream live video to a special pair of goggles or a laptop computer. (Finn) On February 4th 2002, the CIA carried out the first airstrike using a drone aircraft. Its intended target was Osama bin Laden. However, the mission failed to kill bin Laden and resulted in the deaths of civilians. (Sifton) Since the beginning of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, drones have been used constantly to target leaders and military sanctions of the Taliban and al-Qaeda.  (Black 244) In 2003, there were about 35,000 hours of flight-time on the drones used in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan. By 2009, the number of flight hours had increased to over 800,000 hours. The New York Times reported that in 2004 the CIA had secretly hired contractors to locate and kill Al Qaeda operatives in the Middle East using drones. (Web)
Some argue that it is unethical to carry out military actions from a computer screen. That we shouldn't be able to decide the fate of another human being from a map in a  Google earth type program from an office hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Some also argue that drone aircraft will make it easy for police and investigative agencies to “watch” over us in our daily lives. Most of the critique of the spread of drone technology to the civilian sector is centered on that of personal privacy. But what is privacy? Privacy is protection of personal data, privacy of personal behavior and privacy of personal communication. However, data protection is difficult to connect to a basic human right. Drones threaten to erode our personal privacy even more then the airplane did 100 years ago. (Finn) Privacy is not only the only liberty implicated in drone surveillance. (Finn) Some argue that safety is an issue of large scale deployment of drone aircraft. They state that the main issue is that of maintenance, pilot error and the potential use of them as weapons. Because they are unmanned, the maintenance requirements are much lower than manned aircraft, thus making them less reliable. The current accident rate for UAVs is 100 times greater than manned aircraft. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) argues that the poor safety standard that drones are held to pose a risk to both commercial and general aviation aircraft. In 2007, the NTSB reported that pilot error was the cause of a Predator drone crash, as the pilots on the ground accidentally shut the engine off.  (Finn) 
In addition to safety concerns, there are many ethical considerations in the use of Drones in both civil and military applications. Drones have been blamed for significant loss of life on the ground in war zones, and the removal of from the ""human"" consequences and emotional feedback from violent actions. In the military application, it is argued that the overuse of drone technology will lead to a video game mentality where human lives are objectified as ""things to track, spy on and kill."" In the civilian world, drones may bring about an unneeded amount of law enforcement, and that those agencies that operate them will eventually shift their goals from law-enforcement, to public control, containment and eventually restriction of freedom. Some fear ""mission creep,"" or the continue of an operation past it's point of success, only stopping when a final, often catastrophic, failure occurs will eventually spawn out of drone warfare. (Finn) 
There is some debate about how drones affect targets of continued surveillance. Some say that drones raise civil liberty concerns because ""everyone gets monitored, photographed, tracked and targeted.” Also, it is believed that police and homeland security will see drones as ""just another tool in the tool box,"" and there is every reason to be concerned about how they will take advantage of their ""new tools,"" and if they will be used to an extreme or not. (Finn)
Since the earliest weapons such as the bow and arrow, it has been mankind’s effort to separate himself from his victim. This process brought along the catapult, later on artillery and more recently, ICBMs. The pinnacle of this advancement being the ICBM; but ICBMs are never used. Drones allow the feeling of alienation brought by long range ICBM missions in a practical everyday use. The result is violence with the distance and alienation of ICBMs. This is disturbing perhaps because alienation isn't favored by many. (Sifton) In humans, as with in many other animal species, ""aggression drive"" is often limited by a ""submission"" phenomenon. Victims will shut off the aggression drive in others by displaying signs of submission, such as lowering the head to cover the neck, and raising the hands to show you are unarmed in humans. However, some have argued that the isolation brought on by drones has emotionally distanced the killer from his victim. Drones have brought us to a point of entirely risk-free, remote and potentially automated killing. (Sifton)
Another major issue behind drones is the fashion in which they kill. They are used primarily to target individuals and not specific locations, infrastructure or military forces. Unlike a missile strike or manned airstrike, in which a location or target is chosen beforehand, drones patrol and linger around, looking precisely for a target - a human target, and yet, the perpetrator of the violence isn't physically present. (Sifton) Numerous of innocent people have been killed by Predator attacks. In June of 2010, a drone killed at least 60 people accidentally at a funeral in Pakistan. (Web) Some argue that drone strikes are ""deeply aggravating to the population"" and lead to increased support for extremism. International lawyers have called criticized drone attacks as senseless assassinations, as no target ever had the opportunity to defend themselves, and that drone operators are too far from their target to determine if they are an enemy or innocent civilian.  (Web)   ...
However, there are a lot of facts that support the use of drone aircraft; they bring lives off the front lines, they are cheaper to operate then other manned aircraft, and that they open up job opportunities in new markets and trades never seen before. Drones have a vast range of uses, not only in the military field, but the civilian field as well. Specifically the three D's: dull, dirt and dangerous work, thereby protecting human pilots from dangerous situations, stress and fatigue. Drone aircraft can be on standby and be deployed on demand, they have a wide range of abilities, e.g. surveillance of a natural disaster, and they have ""plug and play"" abilities for their payloads, can support high-resolution sensors and can be sent into remote locations.  (Finn)   ...
In the civil market, police and public safety organizations have used drones to monitor large crowds, prevent and monitor criminal activity, assist in relief actions and undertake search and rescue operations. Recently, the UK police have used drone aircraft to monitor the Olympic ceremonies, as well as watch over suspicious looking spectators at the events. The CannaChopper is used by the Dutch police to detect marijuana plants and ""sniff out"" illicit smokers. India has begun using drone aircraft to provide surveillance at ""anti-government"" rallies and used them during the 2010 Commonwealth Games to provide an 'eye in the sky."" In Germany and England small suspicious groups of ""alleged hooligans"" in tight urban environments have been under drone surveillance by police for some time now. In Merseyside England, police were credited to the first drone arrest in the UK when they tracked a teenage thief through thick brush by using a drone outfitted with a thermal camera. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deployed their SkySeer drone, made by Octatron, Incorporated in St. Petersburg F.L., to aid in the search of missing persons in rural areas, monitor accident and crime scenes and to assist in police pursuits. However, they have currently been unable to operate them due to the FAA stating that they don't possess the proper permits for this kind of activity. (Finn) Drones can get up-close and personal, much better and cheaper than satellites and fixed cameras. The ""pint sized"" drones that are coming will be able to fly into a peek around buildings.  (Finn) Italy is currently using the Reaper drone and is considering buying four more, along with three control stations for approx. $330 million. Germany has also shown interest in the Reaper drone, although if purchased, their drones will not be armed, as that step is not deemed to be acceptable in Germany.  (Web)   ...
Privacy concerns could impede the vast use of drones; however, law enforcement agencies have other views. US law enforcement officials have acknowledged the privacy concerns over drones, but they have assured the public that they will not be spied upon by these drones, and that this isn't different from what police have been doing with helicopters for years. LAPD has reminded citizens that currently, there is no place in an urban environment you can go where you're not being looked at by a video camera. (Finn) The AUVSI, or The Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, is quick to reassure pilots that a large percentage of the 30,000 drones forecasted to be in the sky will be low flying and small, similar to RC models.  (Phelps 64) The FAA will make it a requirement for the controlling agencies that operate their drones to issue a notice of where and when their drones will be flying. (Phelps 64)
The FAA and Joint Planning and Development Office, a division created by the US congress, are currently revamping the US airspace system into what is now known as the Next Generation Air Transportation System, or NexGen, to replace the current aging airspace system that hasn't been changed much since the 1960's. NexGen requirements will call for the full integration of unmanned aircraft operations across the entire US.  (Phelps 65) 
In order to carry out an ethical drone strike, the following steps must be taken in with great consideration. First- It is first to be decided if a drone strike is necessary for the accomplishment of that mission. Second- The strike must be carried out on hostile subjects in plain sight. Third- Commanders and drone operators mustn’t call for a strike, or deny a strike, if they know it is to cause considerable collateral effects on civilians or civilian property. Fourth- Commanders must show constant and devoted care to spare civilians from damage and destruction. Fifth- Strikes must be effective enough to spare the targets from suffering or injury. In other words, kill the target in one shot. Sixth- The strike must be carried out only in true military from, such as a large scale operation or attack. Seventh- Drone strikes must only be conducted by certified, lawful operators to insure maximum accuracy and proficiency. Eighth- Commanders and operators should receive prior consent for a strike from the state in which it is to occur. However, in cases where that state is unwilling to or unable to control the threatening activity within, it is reasonable for the outside force to go ahead with the strike.

	For many years now, The Bible, Christianitys' good book, has been influencing the lives of millions of souls all over the spiritual globe. As we know, the results of the influence that this book has can end in catastrophe and cacophony when taken literally. Bible literalists insist on taking the words from the bible at face value instead of soaking in the literary merit that this work of art encompasses. As jesus was known to speak in parables and metaphors in the new testament, so too should the old testament books be analyzed in a similar fashion. The book of exodus has been a citadel for controversy for as long as i can remember. But, if one is able to scrap literal interpretation and examine the ideas and metaphors on a grande scale , a better understanding about the message of Exodus can become manifest. The book of exodus uses metaphors for God, Moses, The Isrealites, the Pharaoh, and the feast to explore the ideas of spiritual liberation.
	Most of us are familiar with the story of Moses traveling to egypt in order to entice the pharaoh to release the israelites so they can serve Lord God incessantly. Taken literally, its a story of flesh, bondage, and the deterioration of a great city. If we can take a moment to separate these fleshly elements from story we can explore the ideas that our characters represent. The first metaphor we must explore to reach a better understanding of Exodus is the symbol of Lord God and the role he plays. God can be looked at as the higher nature or intelligence that us, as flawed creatures may aspire to attain, or in other words, our spiritual liberation. It's the calling unto perfection, to rise above mortality and infallibility. Its the ultimate goal of some in life to reach this plateau. Moses, on the other hand can be said to represent the aspiration to reach a perfect consciousness. The road unto which we can reach spiritual perfection. The Israelites, represent the suffering human soul. More so, its inability to reach liberation easily. Now, lastly the Pharaoh represents to us our selfish ego's. Since the ego is constantly caught up with the self, rather than big picture ideas we could say that the ego is the constraint that keeps the isrealites, our human souls, from reaching spiritual liberation.
	We first encounter Lord God, ""God of Abraham, of Isaac, and the god of Jacob, (Exodus 36), or the destination of our spiritual enlightenment as the un-charred burning bush calling out to Moses(Exodus 3:2). Moses isn't even allowed to wear shoes in the presence of God, possibly symbolizing the obtrusiveness of the material world on our paths to spiritual liberation or the disconnectedness from spirituality we experience as a result of the material world. Moses, as stated earlier as the aspiration of spiritual liberation is introduced as a man of righteous morality as he helps the daughters of a priest of Mid'ian retrieve water for their father's flock, (Exodus 2:16). Here we see the idea of the righteous morality of Moses. Containing the noble morality becomes manifest as the idea of Moses being the high road to spiritual liberation. Moses is chosen by God as a means to liberate the israelites, or the metaphor for the human soul,  that have cried out to god for help, (Exodus 2:25).  Lord God states that he has seen the affliction of his children of egypt,(Exodus 3:7) or the place of captivity of the soul that contrains our ability to reach spiritual liberation. The age of the isrealites should be noted here. The children of israel represent the immaturity and ignorance of the human soul towards self liberation. Moses is chosen to release the children of israel from the captivity of a skeptic and terse-mannered pharaoh. As stated previously, the pharaoh is a metaphor for the ego. The latin translation of the word ego, is I. Now, this story becomes less of a two sided struggle and juxtaposes into a conflict with ones self. The act of liberation (God), for the human soul (Children of Israel), is easily halted by the ego, or self (Pharaoh). Not until the massacre of all the first born sons of egypt is the pharoah convinced to release the children israel (Exodus 11:5).  It's not until times of great stress and contemplation is the mind allowed to start its journey towards spiritual liberation, wherever or whatever that may ensue.
	The story of Exodus is a journey of the self towards liberation. When taken at face value, no doubt, can literal interpretations cause confusion, anger and contempt towards the ideas put forward by The Bible.",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_12mf1s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/12mf1s/my_paper_on_the_metaphors_in_exodus_need_some/,

I still remember the look in his eyes. The look was eager, hopeful, even a little desperate. Even though it was midsummer, Teryell had been boarded up in a small townhouse for the majority of the last two months, and as I stood there on his doorstep and tried to smile, I knew I was possibly the only way he’d be allowed outside. 

This past summer, I attended a local missions camp initiated by my church along with my youth ministry. I spent each day going to a nearby underprivileged neighborhood and building friendships with the kids there - we played kickball, did crafts, and I even had the opportunity to help some with their schoolwork during homework club. 

On the last day of camp, one the older volunteers at the camp approached me and asked if I’d be able to help with a difficult situation that had come up. Due to a serious conflict between two families in the neighborhood, one mother had kept her son Teryell inside for the entire duration of summer. Despite her best efforts, the volunteer couldn’t change the mother’s mind. That’s where I came in: if I could follow the boy around and make sure nobody bullied or hurt him, then maybe the mother would change her mind.

And so there I stood in front of their house, hoping and praying that Teryell would be allowed outside for once. Our presistence eventually paid off: after much coaxing and reassuring, his mother finally resigned. The rest of the day consisted of following a ecstatic and energetic Teryell as he enjoyed what could’ve been his first day of summer break.

As insignificant as this event may seem, it really affected me. It made me grateful for the loving household I was brought up in, saddened to see the state of some children’s living conditions, and determined to help make a difference in the lives of kids like Teryell.

Article: “Little Being Done to Prevent Web Application Threats, Analysts Say”
Author: Moriah Sargent
Date of Article: 19 September 2012

This article describes the biggest threats our latest programming languages are receiving and way companies can combat them but are unwilling to spend the money and time. 

HTML 5 has “15 years’ worth of insecure Web code we need to clean up,” according to found of CTO, WhiteHat Secuirity, Jeremiah Grossman. 
Attackers are entering malicious code into a Web form input box to gain access to resources or make changes to data, this is done in the form of SQLi (SQL injection.) Attacks are also coming in the form of XSS (cross-site scripting) where malicious code is put into a seemingly innocent looking link. The coders gain access to the user’s computer where they can potentially steal their information. 
HTML 5 is posing complications with security as threats are becoming harder to find and harder for developer’s to fix. 

Where speed and functionality take top priority when creating a Web application, security and threats fall in last place, because of more time and money required. 

Grossman briefly breaks down how parameterized SQL statements are used for the attacks. He notes that both XSS and SQLi can be prevented with a context-aware output encoding and input validation. 

What could prevent loss of information, additional money spent and time put into finding and fixing attacks is a call that has to be made from the company executives.

I'm in the process of finishing up my business school applications, I just have an essay to do. 

Unfortunately, I'm stumped. The prompt is to talk about my extracurricular activities (hobbies, volunteering, etc) that I've done the last couple years. Problem is, when I'm not in class I'm at work to pay for my classes. I commute to school 2-4 times a week (50 miles each way) so between both of those I don't have time at all. 

I do stuff like jiujitsu and play starcraft 2 but I really don't see how I can ""twist"" that to be a beneficial thing for the schools.

What should I do?

Thanks!",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_10fj0q,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/10fj0q/business_school_essay_question/,

Should it be medium or media?

I'm thinking in the context of this sentence, it is a plural noun and therefore media is correct?",,False,,t5_2s6rw,False,,,True,t3_1korko,http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1korko/is_this_sentence_correct/,
