1368305159.0,83,self.TEFL,1e5apb,How to make a career out of TEFL (and get paid doing it).,chinadonkey,95,12,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1e5apb/how_to_make_a_career_out_of_tefl_and_get_paid/,"I've seen quite a few posts here regarding making a career out of TEFL and getting to a place where you're making more than ""pretty good considering the cost of living"" money. I've spent the better part of this past year trying to figure that out myself. Luckily, I have a bunch of awesome coworkers who've taught (and worked in many other capacities) in almost every TEFL destination around the world. They've imparted to me a wealth of information which I happily share with you here today.

Most of the jobs listed here require *at least* 1-3 years of teaching experience and a recognized TEFL certification. Some of them are very hard (or impossible) to get into without post-graduate work. If you're fresh out of college and need to start paying back your student loans, a hagwon might be the way for you to go.

Also, this is far from a complete list. As most people don't share their salaries, a lot of the pay discussed is based on my own personal experience or what people have shared with me. Also, people can and will often be paid differently for doing the same job at the same company, so make sure you're negotiating your salary. There's money out there to be made.

**IELTS** Test proctoring can be quite lucrative side work. Invigilating (which involves you making sure students don't cheat and assisting with instructions) pays $20 an hour to stand around and be bored for a while. It's boring, but it's money. Schools often need invigilators and no experience is required; if you don't work for a center that offers IELTS, but there's one in your area, see if they need help conducting tests. You can get paid similarly well for conducting TOEIC and TOEFL tests. 

Being an IELTS examiner (conducting speaking tests and marking papers) is where the real money's to be made, though. Cambridge requires a minimum three years experience working with adults and you need to complete a special (and rarely held) training session. You can get paid up to $15 per marked test. I don't know the rate for working as a speaking examiner, but I did have a coworker who made more on an IELTS day than she did during a typical teaching week. There are also traveling IELTS examiners who go all over the world conducting tests and rolling around in bathtubs filled with cash.

**EAP/AEP Teaching** This is what I do now. Basically, there are truckloads of foreign people who want to study in the US. In many cases (especially in the Middle East) their government will provide a full scholarship for them to obtain a BA or graduate degree here. They also pay for a varying amount of English training to get their language abilities up to a level commensurate with their academic needs. They also need to pass a test like the aforementioned IELTS. 

There's been an explosion of schools opening up, mostly around universities, trying to grab a piece of this huge pie made of money. Programs that don't require their teachers to possess Master's degrees are much less reliable and pay worse than those that do. The former will start teachers out at $15-20 per hour with a bit of paid prep time. The latter is usually salaried and starts at $35k-$45k a year. 

The problem with these programs is that your employment is subject to the whims of student enrollment, which is not always dictated by market forces (i.e. the quality of your teaching). For example, sometimes a scholarship organization will decide to close a state or region to its nationals to encourage educational diversity, which could put your job at risk. EAP programs attached to universities are generally the most secure as they can grant admittance to the university without an IELTS score and thus attract a larger student base.

**Academic Management** This can be quite lucrative, but rejoining the world of office politics and idiot bosses/employees/coworkers can be a frustrating experience. Cultural differences that you could previously brush off and ignore all of a sudden become your problem. Why are the fucking sales staff ignoring customers and playing that goddamned QQ farm game and why are you the only one who cares? You get to deal with that pretty, dumb, blond girl your boss forced on you who calls in hungover every weekend. Stuff like that.

Still, the job has a lot of upside. I've always enjoyed onboarding new teachers, helping them learn the lay of the land and helping change them from tourists to educators. Depending on how much power you're given (or demand at gunpoint) you have the opportunity to create a fantastic academic environment and a successful school. I had a DoS who created a successful training program from scratch (including writing all the materials) which turned him into a superstar for our company.

I'd recommend getting on with a big chain with clearly defined career paths into management. Smaller schools will pay less and have a lower career ceiling.

**TEFL Training** It's hard work running an intensive TEFL program, but it pays well and can afford you a fun, itinerant lifestyle. You typically need a Trinity or Cambridge diploma and at least three years of teaching experience. And MA-TESOL doesn't hurt, either. Some CELTA trainers change schools frequently, even sometimes on a month-to-month basis. It's a long-term gig for others. You can teach in the US or at centers abroad. I saw a job ad here for a CELTA trainer that paid $38k-$42k a year, but that's definitely entry level.

**The Middle East** This is where people go to earn their retirement money. Pay starts at $40k a year and goes up depending on the country. The better jobs generally require either a boatload of experience, an MA-TESOL or both. I've had some great experiences with Arab students, but I don't know if living in the Middle East is for me, for a variety of reasons.

**International Schools** Have a teaching license or a mind-splodingly awesome resume? Do not pass go, go directly to the penthouse we've provided for you, Mr. or Mrs. Teacher McAwesomepants. Legit international schools pay good western salaries in third world shitholes. I don't have a ton of details on working there, but you generally need a teaching license in your home state in a subject they teach. Just being a good TEFL teacher isn't good enough.

If anyone has any further information to add, I'd definitely like to hear. Most of what I read here or on the internet is about the entry-level jobs that most people do for a year or two before moving on, but there's actually a lot of opportunities in the industry.

1345636727.0,49,self.TEFL,ymt87,"Hagwon warning: Do not work for Daniel Language Center, Lee Beom Seok",leebumsucked,50,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/ymt87/hagwon_warning_do_not_work_for_daniel_language/,"Daniel Language Center operates an after school program in Seoul, Incheon, Cheonan, Oesong, Hwanseo and Seonghwan. He also may be opening schools in Busan. He previously had schools in Daejeon, Asan and Dangjin. 

Other names for his school may be Daniel English, Daniel Hagwon, or Daniel Learning Center, or 다니엘학원. It is owned by, probably, one of the most self-absorbed, arrogant, and abusive bosses in Korea. Lee Beom Seok (이범석). 

I worked for him for 4.5 months, which seems to be about the average time for employees. 

While working for him, I was continually paid a week late. My first pay check was 8 days late. I received no healthcare, no pension, and no paystub. On Tuesday and Thursday, I traveled 4 hours round trip and never received the promised compensation for my travel. I am also unsure if my taxes were paid. My work week totaled well over 50 hours per week.

I risked deportation working for him, as I worked at 5 different addresses which is illegal under the E2 visa. 

He also doesn't give an end of contract bonus and didn't pay employees promised bonuses for extra work. 

He continually harassed me and other teachers about our teaching ability. 

I decided to end my employment with him when, suddenly without warning, he told me, on pay day that he wouldn't pay me for the entire month of July for a completely bogus reason. After that he convinced another employee to go home without a bonus, and decided he could, once again, pay me. 


When I first received the details of my job it told me I would be working for ""Korea Afterschool Academy of Continuing Education"" at Seonghwan Public Elementary. When I checked what contract I was working under at Immigration, he simply crossed out “Korea Afterschool Academy of Continuing Education” and put in “Daniel hagwon”. 

So how did I find this job? Through a shady recruiter named “GNBgate” The two recruiters that work for GNBgate are Katie Kim and Bryan Choi. I would encourage anyone to not contract through them as they placed 3 foreign teachers with this awful hagwon. I repeatedly e-mailed Katie Kim about finding me a new job and she ignored all of my e-mails, leaving me high and dry 

When I first agreed to the contract that Katie Kim offered, I was told I would be in Seoul. When she received all my documents (Background check, etc.), she told me the job fell through and that I would have to work in Cheonan instead. 

So in conclusion, if you get your visa and in the remarks section it says 다니엘학원, do not board the plane. Sit your ass down. He just had two foreign teachers quit on him so he is probably looking for someone to immediately fill the position 

Once again his name is Lee Beom Seok (이범석) 
The possible names he operates under after: 
Daniel English 
Daniel Hagwon 
Daniel Learning Center 
Daniel Language Center

I've been teaching for four years and worked in the Czech Republic, Turkey, and Poland as an American.  It is possible!  It's just a pain in the ass.

As an American, the possible countries to teach in is limited to central and eastern Europe (generally).  I know Americans that teach in Portugal, Spain, France, and Italy but those are all fairly special circumstances (special programs, they have higher degrees, etc).  

The Czech Republic is a popular place to start as it has top notch TEFL courses and a huge expat population.  However, the laws have changed recently to make it exceedingly difficult to get legal.  I honestly would no longer advise going to Prague for work as it is a flooded market.  You can find work, but expect to be quite poor and work your ass off.  

Slovakia and Poland on the other hand are both possibilities.  Poland has a special agreement with the United States so the 90 days in 90 days out nightmare of Schengen doesn't apply (seriously).  That agreement is ONLY good for Poland and Americans though, sorry Canadians.  We also have an agreement that allows us to open a business very easily.  The legal process here is a bit easier than other countries, but still quite difficult.  The markets are completely dependent on the cities.  Krakow is of course very crowded with teachers and has low pay, but smaller cities like Gdansk, Poznan, Katowice, and even a bigger city like Warsaw have plenty of opportunities. 

If you look outside of the EU there are also some options.  Turkey needs teachers badly.  There are loads of Americans, but it's not flooded with teachers as of yet.  It is also exceedingly easy to find work.  I made a good amount of money there, but I left since I didn't really enjoy living in Istanbul.

There is also a great program in Georgia to get some experience.  You get to stay with a family and learn al about an extremely interesting country (with amazing god damn food).  http://www.tlg.gov.ge/

Bosnia is also a possibility, although I honestly don't know much about it.  I only know that it is possible and has a decent market for teaching.

There are several countries that are completely off the table like Hungary (you have to pay to be placed in a program there) and Bulgaria.  

I hope this clears up the mystery of Europe for someone looking to come here.

1375166220.0,30,self.TEFL,1jc173,Farewell fuckers..,captainenema,55,25,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1jc173/farewell_fuckers/,"I've been modding /r/tefl for over a year now and it's my opinion I needed to step aside for someone more willing to put real effort into it.

It's been interesting to watch the community grow. It started out with just under 1000 posters and ended up with over 5000. 

Been some great discussions among the sewer tank of noob posts. Which to be fair.. noob posts are to be expected and should be encouraged as they are the bread and butter of /r/tefl. I'm just not the right person to moderate it anymore as my patience for it went out the window awhile ago.

I've been considering founding a new subreddit for long term esl teachers.. a nice quiet neck of the internet where we can talk shit, say fuck, and call each other dirty names. Just don't have a big enough following to justify it.

As a parting thought for /r/tefl:

This subreddit is neutral territory. That doesn't mean we should all be nice to each other or not ask difficult questions of each other. The tough questions are encouraged as the quest for truth is a vital one for an industry that is for the most part entirely unregulated and changing each and every year.

When I started teaching in 2005ish, a celta was considered something special, it carried a certain aura about it, and people who had their celta were respected.

Maybe not in Asia, but you get the point.

Now the market is flooded with the TEFL course providers. You can find perfectly acceptable alternatives to the CELTA. The exceptional became the common and that also seems to be changing. 

I'm not trying to get into one of my famous anti-celta tirades, I'm merely pointing out that things are changing. We are going from an industry of drunks, malcontents, losers, and to some extent I think we are starting to gentrify as a family. 

/R/-telf needs to be the sort of place where hard questions can be asked and debated. /r/tefl needs to be free of commercial interests and this is why I looked at that footprints thread with a bit of dismay. I would much rather of had that IaMa go down in a different subreddit. 

/r/tefl needs to be the kind of place where the big names can be exposed when they are screwing over teachers. /r/tefl needs to be the kind of place where that information can be kept and the various schools and so forth be told to fuck off when they want it deleted. Mind you that's not to say it needs to be a forum for slander and other bollocks, but most of us have only each other to depend on for information and help when the shit hits the fan.

When you got mr. school owner man (read this as Mr. English First Owner) dry humping your leg looking at you with big doe eyes of lust and you are praying he's going to lube you up before the inevitable anal pillaging, you only have god and your fellow teachers to ask if you should clench or not.

Let this be the sort of place where good advice about real problems can be found. Don't let it become a fan forum for schools, tefl cert courses, and recruiters. 

In short, everything dave's isn't, /r/tefl needs to strive to be, minus the pretentious assclowns that make up the bulk of the dave's posting ranks.  That's my opinion, good luck, god bless, I'm gonna go back to sippin' liquor on my afternoon off. 

btw.. can someone unban /u/beakersful? He pissed me off and I banned him and forgot to unban the poor sod. My bad bro, normally I'm better about remembering to do that, been occupied the last couple of days.

It's still useful and I haven't seen it mentioned here at any real length.

**What is LinkedIn?**

It's a social networking site like Facebook with a focus on professionals. You put up your credentials and experience and colleagues endorse your work. It's a very good way to get in front of headhunters and recruiters, and a good resource for industry research.

**How do I set up a LinkedIn profile?**

Follow the simple step-by-step instructions which millions of other people have managed to do.

**How do I tailor my LinkedIn profile for teaching positions?**

Bingo - *that's* a good question. That is what we're here for.

We're going to work off of [my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/renatoganoza) because it's convenient. I'm going to be posting [imgur links](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#0) to screenshots from my profile throughout this write-up. We'll go section-by-section from the top.

A. Your Picture, Your Title and Activity. [Example.](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#0)

It's always safest to go with something formal or semi-formal for your picture. Wear a jacket if you're a guy. If you don't have a jacket, wear a button-up and a tie. A photographer friend might be able to set you up with a professional headshot.

Anyway, your picture isn't a big deal. Set it and forget it. Your Title is a bit more important - if you're currently working and can swing a promotion, put that on LinkedIn *immediately*. If you're between jobs or a student or your title isn't the most inspiring, make that sound as nice as possible and make sure the rest of your profile is on-point.

B. Summary. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#1)

This is where you outline either your goals or your accomplishments in an ""elevator pitch."" What are you proud of? Try to sum yourself up in a few words so that people know who they're dealing with.

C. ""Recent"" Experience. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#2)

You want to be a bit top-heavy with your experience: put the most effort into describing your work at your current or most recent position. People want to know what you've done recently.

Things to keep in mind here:

Most people won't read way down on your profile. If you want to highlight a skill, put it at the top of your page in your most recent position.

It's a good idea to try to demonstrate growth and separate skill sets. Don't keep repeating the same phrases on every entry: no one wants to parse all that. ""Easier"" skills should go on past positions and harder or more impressive ones should be highlighted in recent ones.

Also - you see that ""People Also Viewed"" column on the right there? Those people are getting clicks on their profiles. They must be doing something right, so plumb their profiles for inspiration on phrases and buzzwords.

D. ""Past"" Experience. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#3)

I went a bit too minimalist here, probably. I swear it looked nicer before a recent LinkedIn redesign. Anyway:

If you've held a position for any length of time, you really want to get at least one recommendation on it. I have three recommendations on my profile: one from a co-worker, another from someone who reported to me, and the last from someone I reported to. The three recommendations all reference different skills I brought to play, and balance each other nicely.

(You can request recommendations from other users, and you can ask users to revise recommendations you're not satisfied with. They're going to be stuck on your profile indefinitely - make sure they're good and try to repay favors in kind by recommending others.)

E. Education and Languages. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#4)

If you've got a great track record at school, play it up. If you... ""slacked off"" ""a bit"" you might want to keep it to the basics.

F. Skills &amp; Expertise. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#5)

This is a recent addition to LinkedIn and one that I'm not wildly fond of, to be honest: you meet people with a lot of ""junk"" endorsements just because it's so easy to do. It takes effort to write a recommendation, but none to endorse someone.

Anyway, this section can give you an overview of what a person's known for and which buzzwords are popular currently.

G. Recommendations. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#6)

Again, these seem to have been downplayed in the most recent LinkedIn redesign in favor of endorsements. My suggestions for recommendations were covered in the ""Past"" Experience section.

F. Groups. [Example](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#7)

I don't follow any groups closely. They're barely moderated and most are full of vapid ""I'm looking for a job!"" posts with zero responses. You *can* increase your visibility to recruiters by participating in group discussions, though, which is good.

Make sure you unsubscribe from group digest e-mails if you don't want your inbox blown up regularly.

**So I have a basic profile up with a picture of me in a bowtie. What do I do now?**

Reach out to people. LinkedIn isn't useful with zero or few contacts or with bad contacts.

LinkedIn will offer to scour your e-mail contacts to see whether or not you've got friends on the network. You can let it do so or not. If none of your friends are on LinkedIn or they aren't in industries you're interested in, start joining some groups. Search for ""TEFL"" or ""EFL"" or just crib the [groups I'm in](http://imgur.com/a/8SrRB#7) and go from there. Participate in a few discussions and send private messages to members that seem to be ""on the ball."" If they respond, shoot a contact request with a short message or a question - ""Hey, you seem like a really knowledgeable person. I'd like to keep in touch!"" or ""Hi - I saw your post in (group) and I'm trying to break into Indonesia myself. Can you point me towards any good employers?""

You'll get at least a couple bites and you'll start to grow a network.

**Why should I bother?**

You can spend two hours today setting up a beautiful LinkedIn profile and get no bites or job offers. I get a few connection requests and job offers a week through LinkedIn, but it's erratic - sometimes a few weeks will go by and I'll get nothing, or I'll have an absolutely beautiful offer or two pop up on the same day. You can never tell, but you'd be missing out on all that if you weren't ""out there.""

Imagine that LinkedIn is an information stream. There's an upside to being plugged into it, and little to no downside. Setting up a profile is a minimal time investment and maintaining it isn't hard, either.

If you're still not convinced, though, here's a partial list of the things LinkedIn has helped me do:

- Haggle for a better salary.

- Research the credentials I'd need for a promotion. I looked at a few contacts who held the position I wanted and jotted down their credentials. Doing that five or six times will tell you what you *really* need for a job (which isn't always what is outlined on the ""Help Wanted"" ads!)

- Hire teachers. I've hired teachers who've contacted me on LinkedIn, and I've had teachers who've contacted me on LinkedIn placed at other schools.

- Get a feel for new cities and markets from professionals with similar backgrounds and interests, ""off the record.""

**Anything else?**

Shoot me a message here or on LinkedIn if you've just set up a profile (or have a profile) and want some feedback. Send me a connection request if you want, but make sure you identify yourself and personalize the message - generic connection requests on LinkedIn don't impress anybody.

Feel free to rip my profile apart or to use bits and pieces of it to make up your own.

Missionaries drive down wages (as they're only abroad in short stints and many are supported by tony family members, so they'll work for next-to-nothing or literally nothing.)

Point B:

Missionaries tend to promote Christ more than proper language skills. This is a disservice to their students, most of whom signed up for English language lessons with an eye towards increasing their fluency and communication skills. I have met students who can recite Bible verses and not answer simple, non-Jesus-related questions.

Point C:

Not a one of us can compete with missionaries as far as ""pep"" goes. I've worked with Chinese managers who expected myself and other teachers to be as ""pep"" as the missionaries they've worked with are - and that's frankly impossible. The missionaries would invite students over to their homes and cook for them, and have camp-outs and sing-a-longs and barbecues. I... teach. Then I go home and attend to my things. Missionaries skew expectations for other TEFL teachers.

Point D:

Missionaries openly subvert their contracts, most of which state that you're not really supposed to use the classroom as a pulpit. I look down on colleagues who use their position to try to spread democracy in the classroom, and proselytizing is no better.

1360631834.0,26,self.TEFL,18chq1,Taught English for a year in South Korea and kind of sucked at it. How can I become a better teacher? ,AshleyTeacher,28,2,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/18chq1/taught_english_for_a_year_in_south_korea_and_kind/,"Hi reddit. My fiance and I are currently on the hunt for ESL jobs abroad, and I really need some advice. 

First, some background info:

Last year I taught English in South Korea to children aged 4-13. I went into the job with an English degree, but no special certification or teaching experience. The prep-work was easy but the teaching was difficult. To make a long story short, I struggled with classroom management (i.e. lots of terrible kids), which had to do with a combination of things: my demeanor, communication style, and leniency, as well as the attitude of the parents and the school administration. Things didn't seem to improve very much over those 12 months.

Now my fiance and I are looking for a job in Europe or Japan, and I do not want to repeat that experience. Do you guys have any tips for what I can do to improve my teaching skills? Preferably something free/affordable? I was thinking of taking an online TEFL course, but many people say they are worthless. Problem is, I currently do not have the cash to blow on an on-site TEFL course.

Reddit, what can I do? T~T Should I brush up on grammar? Are there any useful books on teaching ESL, or websites that provide good lesson-plans and such? What advice do you have regarding classroom management and communicating with ESL students? 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks guys! 

Update: Wow, thanks for your responses everyone! You all gave good advice and I'm eager to look through those links. I think I got off on the wrong foot and didn't establish ground rules right away, so of course the kiddos took advantage of that. But I also think our school system exacerbated things - so many students were obviously put in classes way beyond their level and the teachers could do little about it. Many children continually failed their tests but were allowed to level up anyway! (What kind of message does that send??) Our school was free, and I think because of that many of the parents weren't terribly invested in their kids' progress. I rarely got feedback from the parents via my Korean co-teachers, despite whatever I had written in their kids' report cards. 

Still, I can't pin this on my school. I noticed that one of my co-workers (Canadian) seemed to do pretty well with his kids, probably because his teaching style was more simple and direct, and because he established class rules and upheld them consistently. I tend to over-analyze things, second-guess myself a lot, and get stressed very easily, which probably made me a very confusing teacher to have! I still feel bad when I think that I cheated my students out of a better experience. :(

Anyway, I'm very appreciative of the feedback y'all gave me and will try to apply some of it in my next job.

We can truly create a thread filled with the lowest and the freakiest of our fellow ESL teaching riff raff and celebrate their debauchery with a respectful sort of horror. 

The freakiest ESL teacher I've ever met was a guy I bunked next to on a train in China. He introduced himself as, ""MY FUCKING NAME IS DAVE! YOU HAVE ANY BOOZE???"" Ol' Dave must have been a lightweight because half of my bottle of knock off jack daniels later he was passed out on the bottom bunk of a hard sleeper train to Beijing. Now the things prior to that point that came out of Dave's mouth were frightening enough to scare a grown man crawling back up into his mum's womb to get away from the bad man.

This fucker said all sorts of randomly fucked in the head things:

""I wonder how it would feel to fuck a baby?""

""You ever stab a dog?""

My favorite...

""I hate using the WC on a chinese train so I just wait for everyone to go to sleep and piss in front of the door..""

After he passed out it would have been fine 'cept he kept waking up raving fucking mad to the point he was scaring the shit out of everyone. 

Personally, I thought it was funny as hell. But all the Chinese folks were getting their sleep shattered about every hour on the hour as el teacher loco kept waking up screaming and shouting about all sorts of shit.

Finally he settles down enough to let everyone get a few hours of shut eye before arriving in Beijing only to be left on the fucking train by yours truly when I decided that such a charming bloke needed his sleep.

I wonder what the Chinese Rail Police thought when they found a passed out foreigner?

1373233598.0,23,self.TEFL,1hto15,So you're considering teaching abroad. Start here.,peruisay,23,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1hto15/so_youre_considering_teaching_abroad_start_here/,"There's no one-size-fits-all here, so we're going to break it up. Who are you, what do you have to offer and what do you want?

**Are you a licensed teacher in your home country?**

Great! You might want to look at international schools, which generally offer better compensation packages than local options and a high level or professionalism.

Note that a lot of schools have ""International"" somewhere in their names purely as a marketing gesture. One option for finding ""better"" schools is Googling as if you were a parent in your target city: ""[Shanghai International Baccalaureate](https://www.google.com/search?q=shanghai+international+baccalaureate)"" is a fine place to start as far as that goes.

International schools will largely be found in provincial and national capitals or posh suburbs. If you're looking for a more ""exotic"" experience or have a very specific location in mind, as a licensed teacher you still have your pick of the private and public local schools.

**Are you a college or high school student?**

Do you have any teaching experience? If you don't, getting some is priority number one. Teaching is essentially managing a small (or large) group of people towards a common goal. The more experience you have with handling groups, the easier your adjustment to life abroad will be. You don't want to have to be parsing contracts and finding apartments and setting up your internet and learning a language and learning to teach all at once if you can help it. The more comfortable you are teaching, the smoother your experience will be.

So how do you get experience? Lots of ways. See whether or not your school's math or writing labs are hiring tutors. Browse jobs boards for private tutoring gigs in your area. Volunteer with local charities or churches that work with immigrants or reach out to the international students around you and set up language exchanges. Get a summer or winter job as a camp counselor. If you're already working somewhere, ask your manager whether or not you can help with training or onboarding new staff members. If you lack reliable transportation, consider joining [Livemocha](http://livemocha.com/) or another online language learning exchange site.

If you can't do *any one of those things* for whatever reason, re-consider your decision to fly halfway across the world. Seriously. You're going to need at least a bit of grit to up and leave your family and friends and get along in a foreign country. A teacher who can't get their stuff together isn't in a position to help their students or colleagues much.

**Not a career teacher, but not a student either?**

Schools (obviously) prefer candidates with education or English degrees. That said, you still likely have a lot to bring to the table if your experience and education are in other fields. When you're tailoring your resume for teaching positions, play up any training roles you've played and materials you've developed. If you've been promoted to supervisor or management positions, make sure to note that.

(If you haven't done either, take a look at the ""how do you get experience"" bit above.)

**What do you want?**

People teach abroad for all sorts of reasons and one isn't necessarily any more valid than the others. The above sections were basically just making sure that people in different situations are taking steps that will help make them competitive candidates for TEFL jobs.

Now, what you do after you're a marketable teacher depends on what it is you want. It's important to remember that you don't have to stick to one plan, either - you can do one thing this year and another the next. That's up to you.

*""I want adventure. I want out. I don't see this as a long-term thing.""*

I can relate. Make sure your resume is free of typos and that you have some experience you can play up in interviews. If you aren't specific on a location, go through [listings on Dave's ESL Cafe](http://www.eslcafe.com/joblist/) and apply to anything and everything that catches your eye. You'll get at least a hit or two, and you can start tying down particulars - what are the working hours like? What is the city like? Is it a good hub for travel? What ages are the students? What do you need to do to get your visa, and what local laws and regulations should you taken careful note of? Do you need to take any safety precautions? How much money should you bring?

It is important to note here that moving somewhere exotic doesn't guarantee you'll have an adventure, especially if you're in your apartment on Reddit all the time. Make sure you get out there! Learn the local language, ask your students about their lives. Try to avoid making judgments and instead just soak up viewpoints. Don't discount the local customs; try them out.

*""I want to travel.""*

Same as above, but make sure that you end up in a reasonably good travel hub with a lot of train, bus, or plane connections. Also try to take purchasing power into account - it's a lot easier to work in Korea and vacation in China than it is to work in China and vacation in Korea, for example.

*""I want to help people. I want to make a difference.""*

You have to be more specific. Which people, and what is it that they need which you're in a position to provide?

If you want to help people *by teaching English*, the best thing you can do is just be as competent and knowledgeable a teacher as possible. Know your subject - brush up on your grammar and know common learner mistakes. Hone your craft - review lesson plans from other teachers, try new things out in your classes, and ask co-workers and supervisors for feedback. Pursue additional credentials and qualifications.

If that isn't exactly what you had in mind, look into other options. Try the Peace Corps or a Google search for ""region + NGO"" or ""region + nonprofit.""

*""The job market is lousy back home. I just want to earn a living.""*

You'll have an easier time adjusting to more-Westernized national capitals and large cities. Places you've heard of. You'll run into more expats in bigger cities, and you'll see more comforts from home sold in the stores. Of course, competition for jobs in top-tier cities can be fierce and you're going to have to either kill it with your credentials or your looks or your interview.

You'll probably have to make compromises somewhere. What are your ""must-haves""? Do you need a specific level of income to be able to save such and such to pay off your student loans? Do you refuse to use a squat toilet? Is having an oven important to you? Do you need your coffee first thing in the morning to think straight?

Read through the past five or ten pages or fifteen pages of /r/tefl and just read up on different people's experiences. Run searches. If something seems particularly appealing or suited to your situation, try getting in touch with that poster and browse related subreddit(s). Do your due diligence. You want to have as good an idea as possible of what you're getting into. Flickr pictures and Youtube videos and first-hand accounts. That will help a bit with culture shock and allow you to focus on your work.

*""I want to make money. I want to save money.""*

Your ability to earn money as a TEFL teacher is pretty closely tied to your credentials (which ""unlocks"" more competitive and better-paid markets), experience, and ""hustle.""

Again, read through past threads until you find a cost breakdown that sounds appealing to you.

**If you don't feel that your situation was covered above or you have something to add, please leave a comment.**

And, yeah - you've read all of that. Now what?

You go to that nifty sidebar on the right and start looking through job listings. Apply to jobs you're interested in and that you're qualified for. Interview. Look over the contract. If you accept a job and aren't satisfied with the conditions ""on the ground"", take careful note of what you'd like to avoid and have at your next position. If you accept a job and aren't satisfied with your pay or standard of living, find out what qualifications people at your desired pay level have and get those.

1. From newbies, what do you want to learn before you start teaching?
2. From first-year teachers, what do you wish you knew before you started?
3. From lifers, what do you think the newbies need to know?

I have some names in mind for a couple of these, and they probably know who they are, but as a starting point for discussion, I'm thinking:

100 hour ""TEFL Certificate"" course:

Hours:

* 3 Teacher Management
* 3 Teaching in China
* 3 Visas and Immigration
* 3 Teaching in Korea
* 3 Teaching in Japan
* 3 Teaching in South America and Mexico
* 3 Teaching in the US and Canada
* 3 Teaching in Europe
* 3 Contracts and how to spot a bad one
* 3 Teaching in Arab / North African Countries
* 40 Pedagogy and Lesson Planning
* 20 Content Literacy (Grammar for Native Speakers)
* 10 Current Trends in the ESL Industry

At the end of the course, you will receive:

1 100-hour TEFL certificate.
1 copy of everyone else's lesson plans.

If 10 people take the ""class"" and the class generates 10 lesson plans, newbies will receive 100 lesson plans that are reviewed by a class of students with varying degrees of experience, as well as veterans.  That's worth a lot more than the certificate itself, which, like most other ""TEFL certificates"", will be worth the depreciated cost of the paper you print it on.

Taught English in South Korea for five years, recently moved back to the US taking a MA TESOL program. Currently subbing part time for an school that teaches Academic English. 

The problem:
I love teaching English and now hoping to get my MA in it so that I can continue to teach in the US. I find that I'm really good at teaching all the aspects of ESL / EFL except Grammar. This is mostly because I lack the basic foundations in this due to my prior school life was in the arts. 

It is embarrassing to admit I don't know grammar well enough to teach it and harder when faced with student questions in class. But I really want to improve and be able to teach grammar effectively. Students ask specific questions in class about the target grammar and I seem to be unable to go beyond the basic rules presented in the text. Would like to have the lingo and know-how down more. 

Help?:
What would you suggest I do to learn grammar for the sake of teaching it to ESL students? My MA course has a grammar class coming up but I feel the need to learn now.

Would just reteaching myself basic grammar and going from there work? GEtting a tutor?

I was given the impression that my school promoted based on seniority, and at any given time there were 2-6 teachers who'd been there longer than me. My career goals were a bit myopic as well. I didn't envision myself teaching past a fun couple of years in 中国 (for a variety of personal reasons) and I figured that conferences and invite-only trainings were better left to my colleagues with more of a future in teaching. Why compete with my friends for a job I probably wouldn't take?

Soon after repatriating, I realized how much I missed teaching and spent a year figuring out how best to get back into it. None of the colleagues I deferred to are still in education. Also, I found out post-hoc that my school had been interested in developing me as a director of studies but binned the idea when they realized how dead-set I was on returning home. Terrible realizations to have back in America while doing manual labor to get by and figuring out my shit.

My takeaways from the experience:

1. Never turn down or avoid a good professional development opportunity, especially if your school is paying for it. That goes from (lunch provided, natch) short meetings about teaching methodology to management training conferences, even if you have no desire to get into management.

2. When you figure out your near-term career goals, communicate them to your employer as well as your trusted colleagues. If the former values you, they will be more likely to work with you on achieving those goals. If the latter respects you, they will support you even if your goals conflict with theirs. If neither is true, you are now free of a bad employer, a bad friend/coworker, or both.

Tarkaan [commented](http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1f4ic6/soon_to_be_faq_tales_of_degreeless/ca6slgo):

""There is absolutely nothing you can do to guarantee you won't be exploited as an English teacher, but there are two things that make your chances of being exploited go sky high:
Working illegally
Working without a degree.
And by exploitation, I mean:
split shifting without extra pay (this is common anyway, but in some countries, it's against the law)
withholding pay for things like cellphone ""deposits""
Not getting your housing deposit back.
Paying money to your director for bills that don't get paid (VERY common since the bills aren't in your name).
Not getting severance
Not getting pension
Not getting your final check.
If you make the choice to work illegally, these things can and do happen.""

Eveninghope [replied](http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1f4ic6/soon_to_be_faq_tales_of_degreeless/ca6t36z):

""Yeah, this really goes for all teachers. The better your credentials, the better your chances of getting employed by a reputable place. This really is a business at the core. And these people sometimes don't have your best interest at heart - lots do, but many don't.
Some people are going to up and go abroad without a degree, despite forewarning or even common sense. I think the takeaway from this thread should be to do the best you can to not put yourself in a really terrible situation - because it's easier than you think.""

The overall point of this thread is to give you some food for thought, to help you make an informed choice about some of the dangers of working illegally. To help you get some sort of idea of what can happen when you are working without a degree. Will this happen to everyone? 

No, but don't be an idiot and let it happen to you. Take precautions if you insist on violating the immigration laws of a foreign country. Be sure you have money in the bank to bail yourself out of trouble with. Not in the same country you are working illegally in either, your home country. 

If you are smart, you'd find a means of legally working, I recommend the working holiday schemes that exist in some countries. 

Give the stories a careful once over and then make your decision after doing your research. Know what resources you have available to you to work legally.

One example of being able to work legally without a degree is the South Korean Talk Programme:

[Talk Programme UNI](http://www.uni.edu/studyabroad/teach-and-learn-korea-talk)

Spend time looking for legal alternatives rather than putting yourself in a vulnerable position.

Only a fool would do this.  Here's why:

1. The website is terrible.  Lots of broken links.
2. Teacher certification is only required by accredited schools, who are accredited by the country they want certificates from.  These jobs are for professional educators and are highly competitive.  You would need to have completed a pre-licensure program, in-service training (student teaching), pass a state test, and then *maybe* you would be eligible to apply, depending on the certification rules for your state.  Many states now only offer ""provisional"" certification to recent graduates.
3. This program is only considered a ""route to certification"", and only in 11 states.  The ""certificate"" and ""subject area testing"" they offer are worthless.

If you want to be certified, talk to a university about that.  They have programs that can help.  

tl;dr: Don't believe everything you read on the internet.

Edit: This is bugging me, so I'm going to put it out there:  Teaching ESL as a guest English teacher in another country, under another country's system, *does not require teacher certification in your home country*.  Think about it.  That's stupid.  Nobody would do that.

The poster of the thread in question was asserting that yes, being certified to teach in your home country is required in order to get ""good"" jobs (Answering his own question = Blogspammer Strike 1), and not only that, but for $2000, you can get certified at some fly-by-night operation with a shitty website that doesn't work (Providing a link to a solution to a problem he himself has, Blogspammer Strike 2).

Now, there doesn't need to be a Strike 3.  I don't have to play fair.  [Edit:  I just looked at his posting history.  Posting from a brand new account?  That's strike three.  This is nothing but a persistent blogspammer.  Move on.]

Myself, I was in Korea (Seoul) for 2 years and now China (Shanghai) for 5 months, mostly in kids' training schools/English academies/language institutes/hagwons. So here are some of my TEFL-related observations so far:

* First of all, it's pretty much the wild west when it comes to finding a job here in China. The sky's the limit on earning potential. And they'll hire anyone. I did appreciate that in Korea, teachers had to at least have a degree, a clean record and be a native speaker because it made it a lot easier to make friends since we all had at least those things in common - though the glaring homogeneity of the TEFL set made it a bit boring. 
* I'm a brown girl. In Korea, my brown-girl-ness was a really huge disadvantage, both job-wise and socially. In China, the brownness has been a slight disadvantage job-wise, but generally, the people I meet have been much more accepting. And there seems to be much more gender equality in China. (Thanks Communism!)
* Personally, I much preferred the Korean curricula. It was more fully interactive; writing, reading, listening, and speaking practice all happened in the same class, whereas in China, they just want you to teach ""oral English."" It seems to me that they think that if they stick a foreigner in a class with a bunch of kids for an hour a week, those kids are just going to magically start speaking English. I understand that kids in China don't actually write or read until elementary school, but there really has to be a better way.
* China: TA's and parents in the classroom. Fucking terrible. The parents just distract the kids and tell them the answers. The TA's just translate everything I say. Why did they even hire me?
* Chinese parents are much nicer to their kids than Korean parents (ie. none of my kids have come to class covered in bruises yet), but it's to the point where Chinese kids are completely spoiled because one child policy.
* Non-TEFL-related: Korean food &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything I've eaten in China so far.

Anyway, this may have been a bit of a rant. Anyone have anything else? Agree? Disagree? I'd actually like people's opinions on my third point.

I've been searching around Reddit and the internet and have found some great information, but there's a couple things I'm still not sure about.  So hopefully I'm not beating a dead horse too badly with this thread.

I'm about to finish up a BS in computer science, but I can already feel myself getting a bit burnt out on coding.  I really enjoy being a TA for the lower level CS classes though, and it sounds dumb, but I really think I am only who I am today because I've had some amazing teachers in highschool and college.  So, part of me wants to give teaching a shot - both for myself, and as a way to pay forward everything my previous teachers have done for me.

One possibility that has interested me is teaching in Japan.  I'm a native speaker of English, which seems to be a pretty big plus.  My Japanese is still pretty bad (for reference, my university teaches up through Genki II), but I plan on continuing to work at it until I'm fluent.  I've researched and took a class on Japanese culture, and Japan really seems like a nice place to try living.

From what I've researched, it looks like somebody in my position has two options:

* The JET program - they handle everything (and even interview you at an embassy or consulate in your country), and you work more or less standard 8-5 hours, but you have zero control over where you end up in Japan

* Teaching at a conversation school - you get more control over your location, but have to manage logistics and probably have to work in the evenings

There's a couple things I wasn't able to figure out though, so I'm hoping you guys can provide some insight:

* If I do go, and if it does work out, at some point I'd want to move towards a full (not assistant) teaching job, probably at either a high school or university.  What qualifications do you need for that?  For example, my highschool growing up only hired teachers with at least a BS specifically in teaching, and a master's in some other field.  My university requires all professors to have a PhD.

* How is the adult education infrastructure in Japan - i.e., would I be able to take classes to work towards those qualifications while teaching?

* It looks like there's a ton of different certificate programs for teaching ESL.  Do you know if any of these actually mean anything?  e.g. in software, there's only a handful of certifications which a potential employer will care about, at all

* Somewhat unrelated, but would it be possible to get a job teaching in the technology field?  Or should I just consider English teaching jobs?

* Any other thoughts or stories from your experiences teaching in Japan?  What do you think the best way to get started is?

I help people achieve their dreams, it's a stimulating job and it has an interesting travel-related backstory. Plus, my diverse student population lends itself well to amusing anecdotes (the French guy who only referred to his Spanish-speaking friends as Taco, the sixth-grade-esque separation of the sexes in my classes with Arab students, the insistence of Brazilians on having a beer in hand no matter the social situation).

However, back in China (and all across the interwebs), English teachers are scorned as the lowest of the low in expat circles, forever labeled as incompetent drunks who couldn't cut it back home. Those things are sometimes true, but I took particular offense when they were applied to me; I certainly have a large amount of drunken Irish blood in me, but I'm damn good at teaching, and I got into TEFL as a way to flex my brain muscles at work for once and travel. I fell in love with education and have since made it my career path.

Anyways, a couple of ways that I've dealt with the aforementioned assholes:

* Smoking a hookah with a friend at a bar in Sanlitun in Beijing (god, now I sound like the asshole), ""Brad from LA"" and his cousin ""TJ from Cincinnati"" approach us and ask if they can buy some weed from us. After a few minutes trying to deflect these insufferable oafs, we finally tell them that we do indeed teach in a magical, faraway land called ""Henan"" and have no connection to the local cannabis trade. Brad sarcasms that ""I know a LOT of people who TEACH here"" and the only thing that saves me from uppercutting him (I'm not a violent man) are the quick instincts of my friend, who stops my drunken fist and somehow helps me exit stage left. I'm sure his uppance came everntually.

* Belly up to a bar back in Zhengzhou. Skunk-drunk older Irish guy posits, out of the blue, that he can tell I'm a scummy teacher and if I look at him the wrong way he'll call in his driver to shoot me. With a gun. I switch from reasonable American guy personality to argumentative Irish guy personality and we had a bit of a verbal dustup. He tells me he owns factories that cleared over a million RMB last year. I tell him he's a right cunt and can get fucked with a nail-gun (or something similarly colorful). Eventually he falls off his barstool, nearly breaks his elbows and threatens to have me arrested for assault (I swear I didn't touch him, officer).

1. New words - have flash cards out, go to every student individually with the flash card in front of them and have them say the word. I've read this is not a good thing to do?

2. After that, maybe play a game to reinforce the word. Usually one of these:
-use blue tac and stick flash cards on board, have students use flyswatters to hit whichever flash card's word is called out
-have everyone sit down in a circle and pass the flash cards while music plays, when music stops then whoever have the flash card needs to say what it is

3. Reading time. Do a little bit of reading. This is always the most boring part of the class. Anyone have any good ideas on how to make this engaging instead of just, ""Ok Danny, now you read this passage.""

4. Sing a song. Maybe spend a few minutes learning a song from the book, always incorporate gestures while singing the words.

Maybe I'm forgetting some things, but that's basically the gist of it. The kids seem happy enough; my age groups are from 6 to 10, I think. Lessons always feel stretched at an hour and a half.

I focus on playing games more than anything. I don't have a CELTA, just an online TEFL 120 hour cert (which any monkey can get). I never feel like a real English teacher, though, and if someone observed my lessons I'd probably be a little embarrassed at how lame they are.

So, I guess what I'm saying is, does anyone have any advice? What do you guys do? I feel like my classes spend more time playing games than actually learning, but if I were to actually try and teach them something then they'd get bored real quick.

So, can any of you tell me what's a reasonable amount of hours to teach in a day and how many classes? I noticed that evening hagwons in Korea have shorter hours than their daytime counterparts, so that's appealing. Some jobs offer 7 hours work (presumably not all teaching hours) and some seem to have 9-10 hour days.

For instance, one of my concerns regards a background check in which I would have to foot the bill. It’s not outrageously high but it’s a bit of a substantial fee. I have the money to pay for it and have no qualms in doing so but I was under the impression that companies handled this task and only ask for authorization to one’s information.

I'm a recent college graduate who really wants to teach in China for a year or two before doing the grad school thing.  I received a TEFL certificate from Oxford Seminars last January (not the best certification course in the world, but I needed the piece of paper), was set up with recruiters after my class ended, and last night had an interview with a private english teaching company in Yangzhou that sounds really promising.  The company sounds professional, their facilities look sleek and modern, and their contract was even typo free (a first, in my experience).  The interview went very well, but when I asked if I could possibly communicate with other foreign teachers at their school, the school official hesitated, asked someone something in Chinese, and then politely said ""Oh, no"".  I didn't press the issue, but this seems like a red flag to me, as other schools have actually had current teachers send emails to me advertising their schools.  It's possible that this particular company didn't want to bother their present teachers with pestering questions from a new hire, but.....it's also possible that they might not treat their foreign hires well.

Should I be worried about this?  The school is offering 8200rmb/month with an extra 1000 for housing, with 25 teaching hours and 15 office hours per week.  I really want to teach adults while living in a large city in eastern China with libraries, museums, universities and a large foreign population, and this school is the first fit that I've had.  However, I don't want to sell myself into indentured servitude for a year.  Another concern is that the contract says that apart from teaching I need to attend business meetings, give class demonstrations,  and do other administrative tasks, but when I asked the school official about this she said that apart from teaching all I need to do is to have free office hours when I can help students practice their english.  

Do any ESL veterans have advice?  If you have taught in a private language academy (opposed to a public school/university), what was your experience like?  Are private language schools in China trustworthy?  Also, I've been primarily relying on recruiters to contact schools.  Is there any way that I could find schools directly?  Any other advice I need to know before signing a contract to teach in China?  Sorry for the all of the questions, but I'm new at this and don't want to make a year-long mistake.",,False,self,t5_2qq76,False,,,True,t3_1db3wv,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1db3wv/tefl_newbie_in_need_of_advice_should_i_take_this/,

As you may have noticed, before the holiday, I enabled the [/r/tefl wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/wiki/index).  Click ""wiki"" at the top of this page.  I have since lowered the total subreddit karma to 20 to allow more active participation from less active users.

***THE WIKI:***

I'd like to propose that articles in the wiki be grouped into three subcategories.

1. Pedagogy - methods, sample lessons, teaching materials go here.  An article on writing a PPP lesson plan written for teachers who are used to grammar translation would go here.
2. Legal and Immigration - Country pages go here, with useful information, links, legalities, and realities associated with specific regions.  An article on the challenges of working in Saudi Arabia for teachers used to the social permissiveness of Korea would go here.
3. Jobs - Interviewing, resumes, portfolios, certificate courses (TEFL/CELTA/etc), and things related to the business end of ESL.  An article about how to market yourself as an F-4 Private tutor in Korea would go here.

Of course, as a wiki, as it grows, you won't see these categories.  An article on the grammar translation method would undoubtedly mention that it is used a lot in Korea, which would lead to the Korea country page, which would lead to pages with immigration and a hagwon blacklist, etc.

***HOW TO CREATE A WIKI PAGE:***

http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/wiki/[pagename]

Where [pagename is, is the name of your page.  For example, if you go to http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/wiki/korea and that page has not been created yet, you can add it.  Discuss changes on the talk page.

There you are.

***HOW IS /r/teflteachers RELATED?***

Well, if the person who downvoted all the articles there yesterday would calm down for a second, /r/teflteachers is about teaching materials and ideas.  I would like these to be reflected in wiki pages when they come up, usually in the pedagogy category.  This subreddit, /r/tefl, would provide a lot of the content for the Jobs and Legalities categories.  That doesn't mean that you can't post teaching methods here in this subreddit, it just seems like this is where things are going to fall out.  I could be wrong.

I would want to teach any level *above* kindergarten.  My preferred age is 6-adult.  My most recent contract is up at the end of June, would that be a good time to go?  Is there a hiring season?

I found this [link](http://matadornetwork.com/abroad/how-to-get-a-job-teaching-in-japan/) to be pretty informative.  Can anyone confirm or deny its info?

I love teaching, love kids, looking forward to Japan.  I don't speak any Japanese, but I'm willing to learn.  I've been studying Chinese for 6 months, so I figure it may help with some of the Characters.

When I came to Taiwan I had no friends, no job, no place to stay.  I just bought a one way ticket, and with some luck, and help from new friends, was able to find work and make a life for myself.  So my question is this, *how* to get work in Japan.  Is just showing up a good idea?  Is is better to find work before hand?  What are the actual websites that would be good to visit for finding jobs in Japan?

I know that as an American, I can stay for 90 days without a visa right?  But I've also read about a work visa, I'm assuming that has to be sponsored by an employer?

We've been teaching in Korea at this point, and will have a year experience by the time we're finished. We both have college degrees, and I have my Trinity CertTESOL (while she doesn't have any sort of TEFL). 

We're primarily looking at South America right now for a few reasons. We're both interested in traveling around the area and living there. We're both interested in learning more about the culture as well. I studied Spanish in high school and college, and really want a chance to improve my knowledge. I'm also quite interested in the history, as well. 

Right now, we're looking at Uruguay, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, and possibly Colombia (though we're open to other suggestions). 

We do have a few questions though. While we'll have some savings from our time in Korea, we would like to be able to make money while living there. A little bit more than just getting by would probably be okay--as long as we can save a bit to recoup the costs of flights, and maybe some to travel as well. We're not looking to live a crazy, outlandish life, so we'd like to think saving wouldn't be that hard. Is there a country that pays better (compared to cost of living) than others? Is it possible to save there?

We're also looking at the ease of finding a job. I'm sure it's much harder to find a job in some countries. We're not particularly worried about working 'illegally' as long as it's more the established norm--if working illegally is difficult there, then that'd be a problem. Where are the best places to find a job (relatively) easily? Are there some places where it's nigh impossible?

1375885283.0,12,self.TEFL,1jvue4,One of my favourite resources to make puzzles: Make my snake [OC],insertfunnyusername,14,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1jvue4/one_of_my_favourite_resources_to_make_puzzles/,"This was something I started making for my classes ages ago. I haven’t made one for ages but I remembered it this afternoon and thought I would share it with you guys. It was an idea I came up with based on other puzzles I've seen. A friend I showed it to made his own software to do it. 


**Background**


Class full of young learners about 8-10 years old. We had been doing the simple past recently. We had done ‘to be’ and had just finished regular verbs. This was a review of that. The Kelly in the story was my TA who I used to lightly tease in class. She always found it funny and it make the class laugh. They are also obsessed about if she has a boyfriend.  


Although this was YL I think it could be used with any level or age group


**What is it?**


It’s kind of like a word search, but it’s more about grammar and sentence formation as well. Students have to be able to predict the type of word that comes next find it 


**Huh?**


Ok, let’s just take a look. Firstly download [this file](http://www.filedropper.com/makemysnake) and unzip it. You need to make sure you have a recentish version of java installed as well. Run “SnakeApplication”  and you should get a box like [this](http://i.imgur.com/nXmTZU3.jpg). Type some basic sentences practicing the target language into it. I usually make a story like [this](http://i.imgur.com/WkTOp9W.jpg). Then hit the make button.
Two things are created (usually in a web browser). You will get the puzzle sheet like [this](http://i.imgur.com/XJwqTrV.jpg) as well as the answer sheet like [this](http://i.imgur.com/y0Gnazv.jpg). If you don’t like the way it comes out then just keep hitting the make button until you get one you are happy with. 


**What’s going on here?**


The puzzle always starts in the top left corner. It writes out the sentences often changing direction. Students need to try and follow the sentences to the end. I usually make it a bit clearer where the start and end are by adding something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/jcUyLhs.jpg) and telling them they need to follow it till they finish at the smiley face. They need a lot of support the first time sometimes. And you should do the first sentence or 2 together to make sure everyone's got it.


I usually get them into small teams of 3 or 4 and get them to work together. They can also share their work with other groups. This makes it easier as well as more communicative and fun. Having them use highlighter pends is usually a good idea. I’ll usually make it into a bigger worksheet by making something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/uovhzSQ.jpg).


**Why is this good activity?**


I’ve had so many success stories with this. The one that most sticks in my mind was when it was a story with a load of different tenses. They had got through half of it but the entire class was stuck on one part, “Yesterday he play…” they were all trying to think of sports to find. One group asked me to help them, I asked them to read it to me, they did and I just gave them that ‘Come on, think about it’ smile teachers use. One of them suddenly screams “YESTERDAY!!!! YESTERDAY!!!!” and shows all her group the answer she found. Suddenly all the class has worked it out and powering on through the puzzle. 


I've used this puzzle for loads of other things as well. Most tenses, articles, possessives, I like/he likes… the list is endless. It seem in English we often tack extra bits on the end of words or have one word directly influence the next one. 


[Now have a go at this one!](http://i.imgur.com/nba80kO.jpg) ( Clue, it starts 'I hope you find the word snake useful...)

1374818909.0,12,self.TEFL,1j2yws,[Modpost] Caveat emptor: be smart about using recruiters,chinadonkey,16,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1j2yws/modpost_caveat_emptor_be_smart_about_using/,"Recruiters are one way to secure employment in a foreign country (they're quite popular in Korea), but please be smart about who you use. It's pretty clear that the AMA at the top of the front page is straightforward SEO marketing and I've removed posts that violate this sub's rules; I left it up because there's a lot of valuable discussion about using recruiters. Most of the most important questions were left unanswered:

* How much are you paid by the companies you work with for recruiting teachers?

* What kind of support do you offer teachers once they're in-country? What happens if they have a problem with their school?

* How can you be sure that your salary is the same as the salary of a teacher with similar qualifications who did not go through a recruiter?

The fact that the OP left (got off work?) once the questions were more than job inquiries is troubling. [This poster](http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1j1nb4/i_am_a_recruiter_for_international_teaching_jobs/cbahvs9) worked with footprints and had a mixed experience (he didn't find a job through them).

This post is an advisory to anyone considering contacting footprints recruiting based on their IAMA. Trying to find some new teachers by way of a quasi-informative IAMA is awkward at best and seedy at the worst.

Googling schools in places where I want to work is generally my preferred way of finding employment, but if you decide to use recruiters, be smart about it. Use multiple recruiters to ensure you get a competitive salary with fair conditions. Don't accept the first, second, third or sixth job offer until you find something that feels right. Make sure they're up front about what kind of commission they make from the school and what affect it has on your salary. Contact current teachers at the schools they send and look for red flags in their responses. Also, don't use a recruiter if you're going to China; they're some of the worst people I've ever met. As in, steal your whole monthly salary and dis-a-fucking-pear into the ether.

Please use this thread to ask questions or post feedback about using recruiters.

1374526477.0,11,self.TEFL,1iu6g5,Just put in my 2 weeks notice; what a rush! Do I need a CELTA? Am I crazy not having a final destination country picked out? (xpost from /r/IWantOut),Trent_Alkaline,14,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1iu6g5/just_put_in_my_2_weeks_notice_what_a_rush_do_i/,"Well, I just finished my exit interview at my corporate office paper pushing gig in the oil &amp; gas industry (what a soul crushing industry rife with moral qualms). I've been slowly going nuts in this job for the last year and the wanderlust has been kicking strong.

A little background: I'm 28 years old, single, very few true commitments/responsibilities, I hold a bachelors degree of English, I have no debt, and I have a decent nest egg in my savings (enough to last without employment roughly a year abroad in SE Asia or other ""cheap"" countries + return airfare and a deposit on an apartment back in the USA if needed). I also have a family that is supportive enough that if shit goes truly pear shaped, I can always crash with a relative for a while until I find sea-legs again.

I chose English as my major in university back in 2004 with the dream of teaching abroad. I'm not sure where that dream went awry, other than I had this feeling that I needed to prove to my family / myself / the world that I could hang up my bohemian ways and pursue the American Dream of 2.5 kids, a house in the suburbs, white picket fence, dog running in the yard, a fancy car, etc. Yeah. I'm finding zero satisfaction in that endless consumer chase and it's time to rekindle that dream of travelling and supporting myself on the road.

Over the last few years I've done about 5 months total backpacking in the past in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Those have been mostly trips as a duo with backpacking buddies, but I've done a few weeks solo travel and while it terrifies me (a bit of social anxiety), I often find that I'm the most confident and have the least anxiety when I'm forced into the beautiful situations backpacking puts one in and I think doing the expat thing for a while will do wonders for my confidence and overall satisfaction with life and give me some purpose, even if that purpose is simply to immerse myself in travel and foreign culture.

So now my gameplan is to finish my 2 weeks here at this job in Denver, then go sign up for BridgeTEFL and get my CELTA cert--my understanding is that the CELTA is pretty much the cert to hold if you want to look the most legitimate. Meanwhile, I'll sell off all of my non-critical possessions, put the rest into storage. Figure out something to do with my car--either sell or store it. Figure out something to do with my gaming desktop PC--likely sell/part it or store it. And then take off for Asia. I figure backpack around Asia for a month or so just getting my bearings and figuring out where my favorite spots are, and then start hitting the pavement with a suit and a binder of resumes to find some employment. Everything I've read about countries a little more off the mainstream path--Vietnam or Cambodia for example--is that their culture appreciates face to face conversations more-so than internet and generally you'll have a better go of it if you just go to the schools and apply versus trying to cruise Dave's ESL or whatnot. What are your experiences with this?

I'm really torn on where specifically I want to go teach. I've got close friends who rave about Vietnam and have spent a significant chunk of time over there and it's probably my top choice. I'm really curious about Cambodia and Myanmar as well. I'm sure Thailand would be a safe pick, but I think it's probably too touristy for me. Beyond that, I really have no idea about SE Asia and just can't wait to explore it. Then there's a couple of outlier countries in the mix--I have strong contacts with a professor in Saudi Arabia and I really enjoyed my time in Istanbul and Turkey as a whole--so I figure if I burn out on SE Asia, I'll head West and try my luck there. Will a CELTA be worth it for these countries? I'd like to take some sort of certification like CELTA so I can have a little bit more of a clue for the teaching portion of things--while I hold a degree in English, it wasn't a teaching degree and I have pretty much zero experience in front of a classroom as a teacher.

I do unfortunately have a smudge on my background check from my first year at University--I was caught driving wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too fast in my car, had some marijuana in the car, and spent a night in jail subsequently. That said, all charges except the speeding itself were ultimately dropped/dismissed/deferred, but I know just having the arrest report on my history will rule out a few countries for me--specifically S.Korea and likely Japan--I plan on making some calls to embassies to try and get more clear answers on whether I'll be able to get work visas in places in the coming week, though. I've heard mixed reports on whether I'd be eligible for a work visa in China or not. I'm not looking to work without a work visa or attempt anything shady.

Any advice or thoughts are much appreciated. This is going to be a whirlwind few months, I feel like I just lit a fuse on a rocket ship. The next CELTA course here in Denver starts in Sept. My lease on my apartment ends October 1st (although I can go month-to-month after).

They already don't want me to work in korea for a year (or more maybe) and their biggest argument is that if I do this I'm screwing my life up and messing up my career. 

So a little background. I graduated in December with a major in marketing. I've had about 3 promosing interviews since then of which none resulted in a job. So I'm living at home and detailing cars as my own business for money. Well I have been getting everything in order to teach in korea and have another interview coming up. Since I have no experience in marketing besides a small startup with a friend the parents are wanting me to ditch everything I've gathered for Korea and take this job (haven't had an interview yet).

Now I really want to go to Korea. I've never traveled out of the USA, haven't left the state of Texas in 5 years, and always wanted to study abroad and never did. I'm only 23 and to me this is a great opportunity to broaden myself and experience something truly different. I like being out of my comfort zone. I'm not a huge fan of following what everyone else does. That's why I am working for myself right now and if I could I would rather have a job in photography or music (my minor) sometimes. They prefer me to take this job (which I don't have yet) for a year and then think about going. However, let me say for me if I take it I do not think I'll ever go if that happens. I have nothing tying me down no, no gf, not a ton of friends local anymore (all moved) and no bills or apt. To me this seems the perfect time to take the opportunity to move to korea for a year, teach, travel some, blog, make videos, and do lots more photography than I've done lately.  

Since this has actually been more of a rant let me ask the real question. 

If I do not get/turn down the job in Texas and go to korea for a year. Am I really screwing myself over when I eventually come back to the states and look for a job in Marketing again? I don't think that teaching abroad looks bad on a résumé. Hell I think it looks pretty good. However, in my parents eyes, an employer will dismiss me and not consider me because as my parents said ""I've been out of my major focus to long"".

I've slowly been falling into the trap of getting stuck at a job that--thankfully--treats me well but doesn't fulfill my life in just about any way, shape, or form. So I made a resolution recently (not an actual new year's resolution) to travel more and see more of the world, and I finally feel confident and ready to teach English internationally. I'm very excited for it, but am admittedly going into it with little knowledge and experience. I'd love any help people have to offer me. 

Right now...my initial game plan is to go to Prague for the Oxford TEFL program. Ideally, I would like to go there, spend the month completing the program and earning my certificate and then get hired not too long afterward and just try to live there for as long as I can. I think ""ideal"" is the key word, though.

/r/prague helped me out a lot, and a few gave me extensive pointers about what I'm getting myself into. All in all, Prague seems beautiful, relatively cheap and exciting, but I've gotten a lot of warnings from people that acquiring your visa there is *particularly* difficult and sometimes near impossible. That's why I'm looking to have a solid backup plan in case I realize I'm not able to get hired in Prague...or even live there.

My backup plan would almost certainly be in Asia, but I wouldn't really know where. I've heard, like most other people, that S Korea, China and Thailand are good options, but I don't know a whole lot beyond that. I've talked to and heard from some people who have taught in South Korea and they definitely talked it up and made it seem like I *had* to go there, too. 

Does anyone have any good advice on countries to teach at? Again, I'd love to continue chasing after Prague, but if it doesn't work out, I want to be able to fall back on something and not have to go straight back to the U.S. Any programs for getting your certificate that you might recommend beyond Oxford? I instantly assume Oxford is a good way to go, because I figured they would have connections for jobs all over the world, but maybe there's something better out there. 

Also, when I told people that I would be going to Prague, paying for my flight, spending $1800 on the course and $500 for living alone, they all kind of laughed and said I should be getting paid for *all* of that. Any opinions on that?

Via the title, I think you might be able to guess that I am considering bailing on my job.

I have two main questions

Does Korea have low teaching hour positions? I keep seeing 120+/month on DavesESL, which is quite high if that means 40 hours of 'standing and delivering' each week.

Is it possible to stay in China and find another job? Would there be complications with getting a new working visa if things ended poorly? Our visa isn't even under his company. I another shady move, he registered us through a public school with which he is affiliated but we have never worked at.

It was my first summer in China. I was new to teaching, couldn't speak Chinese and was thrown into a summer course with some low-level middle school students. Four two-hour classes a week, less than half of the students had workbooks, and the course structure was offensively vague (i.e., ""Go teach about Italy this week!""). The students' English (and interest in English) was low, I didn't have a local assistant and most of my lessons came from throwing enormous amounts of spaghetti at the metaphorical wall.

A lot of times I resorted to the old ""Talk about stuff I do because I'm a foreigner and that must be interesting"" schtick. Midway through a thoroughly boring story about my visit to a sushi restaurant, I ask the class if anyone knows what *wasabi* is. All of a sudden, ten heads perk up in unison.

""What was that teacher?""

""Wasabi. You know, it's green, it's spicy.""

""Say it again.""

""Wasabi."" Followed by giggles.

""Slow.""

""Wa-sa-bi."" Guffaws.

- ""Glorified babysitter."" Depending on the class size and school, it can feel like you're ineffective and basically just killing time - I'm thinking the ""put a foreigner in front of ninety kids for twenty-five minutes with no real goals or curriculum to follow and you never get any feedback"" lessons. I did very few of those, though, because parents sought me out when they needed real gains, fast. If you specialize in IELTS training or corporate language training or build up a reputation for being good with kids, you don't do the ""warm body"" classes.

- ""You couldn't get a job back home."" While there's definitely been an uptick in questions about TEFL since the world economy took a dip, plenty of people from plenty of fields and backgrounds try their hands at teaching. Some see education as a possible career choice or an option down the road. Others have an interest in a culture or are also working on other projects in their off-time. Some just prefer the work-life balance to whatever they've got going on.

- ""You just play with the kids."" Sometimes, yeah, actually: if I need to break up the monotony of a lesson or the kids have just absorbed something really tough or need a bit of a warmer, I'll play a strictly game-game.

My director, is expecting me to go to this school called LCI. After visiting a different school of my friend's, I believe I'm going to go with hers and not LCI. The thing is, my director isn't planning on paying for my plane ticket let alone my KTX tickets for a visa run and 120,000 health check that she agreed to pay for. She said she doesn't have to and the contract is void because I don't work for her school anymore. 

She was expecting LCI to pay for all of this, and LCI wasn't even aware of that. I guess she told them that my american co-teacher and I will be signing with them TONIGHT so they got apartments ready and even bought sheets for us, etc. Apparently, she made a deal with them, to send my old students there or something like that. It's not that I don't think I would happy at LCI, but I'm just so turned off to the whole thing because of how shady my ex-director is being. I just have a bad feeling about it, so I declined. Frankly, this lady is a real bitch and literally doesn't care about what happens to me. She thinks she has the right to send me to any school she wants. I'm ""her employee.""

My friend, or possibly soon to be new director, is helping me with legal things and even talked to my ex-director (her English is bad), but this is really complicated and even more so if she decides to run. I don't even know if she's going to pay my salary on the tenth (she'll owe me around 2.3-2.5). She still owes everyone who was employed to that school a lot of money. I had her sign a letter of release but apparently it isn't official so we'll have to get her to sign a new one, a whole other issue. 

I can afford to eat the health check and KTX ticket, but $950 for a plane ticket? I can't let that one go. 

I can't believe this is happening and these past few days have been such a whirlwind. I realize this situation isn't very usual, so to anyone considering Korea, please take this with a grain of salt.

Anyways, help? Suggestions?

Enter slowmoon. 25 years old.  I'm an American currently teaching in mainland China. I have teaching experience, a 100 hour TEFL certification, and more than a bachelors degree. I like teaching English and I myself am a student of languages. IMO, China is probably one of the best places to make money. I pay almost no taxes. Demand is high. I regularly get unsolicited offers to teach people for 200+ RMB (30+ USD per hour), which seems similar to what people get in Japan or Korea, but China's cost of living is much lower. Saving $2000 USD per month working less than 40 hours per week is pretty doable. It's really easy to get a job. I could pay an ""ayi"" very little to clean my apartment and cook if I wanted.  

So why move to Japan? People on Reddit and other places online say that the Japanese economy isn't good. The market's saturated. There's more competition. It's harder to get a job. There's less demand. My quality of life won't be as good. Well, I don't believe that it's impossible to do it. I met several people in Tokyo and Osaka last year who said finding an English teaching job wasn't too hard. I visited Japan last year and I liked it. I like the language. I like the sights, sounds, and smells. I'm not in it for the money. I want to live in a relatively big city. I've already visited Tokyo and the Kansai area and I think the Osaka suits my style the most. In other words, I am completely willing to take a hit in the comfort of my life in order to teach in Japan because I like Japanese culture and people. 

From my research, a teaching job through JET seems to be the sweetest option, but you cannot choose where you are placed, so I'd likely end up in a rural area. I'm not interested in that.

Interac seems like a good option to get started as they'll sponsor a visa.  After I get to Japan, I'll have about 7000 USD to live on before my first paycheck if I need to. My research tells me I can find a place in Osaka for about 60000 YEN per month. I'm interested in starting in September. I'm relatively close to Japan and could fly there for a few days if necessary.

I'm not trying to screw anyone over. Would it be considered bad form to work somewhere for 6 months and then change location/jobs once I get my visa?

3)I have no teaching experience, but I've always thought it would be fun to teach and I believe I have a solid grasp on the english language. I don't know any Mandarin but I would love to learn. Is the lack of experience and knowledge of Mandarin going to cause me any issues?

I am seriously considering teaching English in Taiwan starting sometime next year and I have some questions for those of you out there that might know anything about this.  I know there are a lot of questions here, so feel free to answer any or all of them:

* How do I go about getting a job? Are there any good online job listings or resources that you would recommend?
* Is there a preferred time of year to start?  I am thinking of sometime in the late summer or early fall of 2011, but I am pretty flexible. How far in advance should I start looking?
* What kind of pay and perks can I expect?  Do schools usually pay for things like rent and flights?  I still have student loans and would like to be able to put at least a little bit of cash into those as I work.  Is that a reasonable goal?
* Would you recommend going over there to find a job or finding a job here before leaving?
* Where would the best place be to live and teach?  I am pretty young (23), single, and really enjoy outdoors (hiking, beaches, mountain biking).
* My number 1 concern with going over there is that I'm kind of worried that I won't meet any other North Americans or Europeans to hang out with. Also that the language barrier would make it nearly impossible to find any Taiwanese to hang out with.  Basically, I'm worried that I'll end up alone with no friends and hating my experience because of this.  How easy or hard is it to find other young westerners to hang out with?
* I'd like to learn mandarin.  I know absolutely no mandarin at the moment, but the local community college offers a course that I think I might take in the winter term.  Are there courses offered for us English-speaking folks over in Taiwan that I could take to help speed up the language learning process once I get there?  How reasonable is it to try to learn mandarin in a year while being completely immersed in it and taking a course?
* Should I be considering certifications for teaching English before I leave?  Keep in mind that I am a native English speaker (Canadian), have a university degree in Computer Engineering (graduated this year) and plan to be working full-time right up until a couple weeks before I leave
* How do visas work?  Can I expect my employer to take care of that, or at least help me along with the process?
* How does vacation time work?  Are there many holidays which can be used as travel time?  Is flying to mainland Asia and tramping around for a week on a holiday something that would be reasonably priced and possible if you are teaching full time?

1. An in-person course with classes I can take on the weekends.
2. An in-person course with full-time classes that would last one week, max two.

After I graduated, I couldn't get into JET, and didn't have the money to accept any other offers from other ALT programs (only had $1k to my name). So I got a TEFL cert from my university (not 100 hours), then I worked for EPIK in South Korea for one year. My original plan was to work there, save money, then go to Japan. I found I really disliked teaching elementary kids and headed back home. 

When I got back, I got CompTIA A+ certified and got a job at a help desk and did that kind of work for a little over a year. Job was okay, but things happened and I've been unemployed for the past three months. I'm thinking ESL, but I can't fathom the thought of teaching kids again, so I never applied to any jobs in Japan since teaching kids seems to be the market currently.

I tutored college students in Japan when I was studying there. I made good money (2000hr+ yen), and my clients made good improvements. My strong suit always seemed that my natural speaking speed was slow and easy to understand. I always spoke in a way that they could understand, or I could guide them to the right answer without telling them. I enjoyed that. I listened, was able to spot what mistakes they were making and why, and got them to be confidant in speaking. Is there any chance in hell to get that kind of work in Japan? 

I'm currently unemployed and looking at different job options, with ESL possibly being one of them. I'd love to look at ESL as an opportunity in Japan (this time I do have money saved up), but I don't think I can handle teaching little kids again. Is there anyway to teach adults without having to get a masters in TESOL?  I'm not 100% sure what I want to do yet, but I want to bounce this idea off of others and get some second opinions. I'd appreciate any input.

I taught English in Korea last year and I am planning on doing it again. It's a great experience, I learned a lot, met great people and I think it is just a great way to spend a few years of my life. That said, I do not plan on doing this forever (I imagine most of you are in the same boat). And while TEFL is a great experience, it doesn't necessarily translate to job opportunities back home.

I know a lot of people save up their earnings abroad and use it to help pay for grad school back home. I could definitely see myself doing something like that. I have already researched the graduate programs I am most interested in and I have the right educational background, GPA, etc to apply and get into the program. My only concern comes with getting letters of recommendation. Usually people who wait a few years after undergrad to get back into grad school can get these type of letters from their employers. But as English teachers abroad that is not really an option for us. 

So I am wondering, if anybody has or is planning to enter grad school after their TEFL experience, how did you (or how will you?) get these elusive letters?

I majored in linguistics but dropped out 12 credits short and now I am in shitloads of debt and have no BA. Luckily I do my have my A.A. though and I'd like to make the most of that. 

Basically it has been my goal to teach overseas since I was 18 and I've decided I will have to do it without my 4 year degree. To prepare for this I have been living at home to save up money and have about 3k in the bank from working minimum wage jobs. 


So thats it. I have almost $3000 saved up, a passport and an AA degree and am desperate to get hired over seas. What are your guys' advice? Is this feasible? Is it dangerous? I originally planned on teaching in Japan once I got my BA (studied Japanese for 5 years) but since that didnt pan out I am currently thinking Taiwan. I am a bit worried about the visa process for Taiwan though, especially since I do not know the native language.  I'd really appreciate any advice or input about Taiwan or wherever else you think I could get a job. I am willing to go anywhere as I have spent 25 years in this small town and am dying to go out and see the world. Thanks for your help and I am sorry for being disorganized and rambling a bit. 

**I should mention that I cannot return to school and finish my B.A. My father died and what not while in school but basically I was given too many last chances and now they will not accept me, nor will I be able to send my transcripts anywhere until I pay them off. Thats why I am stuck looking for a job right now. Teaching overseas no matter where i go would be a very fulfilling and refreshing change from my current situation.

I am seriously considering teaching English in either China or South Korea. I have been doing research and have discovered lots of blogs about why people hated their experience and one common thread I observed is their stories of employers taking advantage of foreign English teachers through non-payment and last minute scheduling changes. 

I am currently a teacher in the US and some of what I am hearing is typical behavior of administrators/school districts. I was really jazzed and excited to teach in a foreign land (because I love to teach) but I'm hesitant now...

Im reaching out to this subreddit to find out the following questions:

1. What recruiting agency (if any) did you go through and were you satisfied? Why or why not?
2. What school did you teach at?
3. Were your experiences at the schools unlike experiences you had here teaching in the US?
4. What kind of employment opportunities came about when you returned to your native land based on your experience in the different Asian cultures?
5. Would you be willing to send pictures of your residence provided by the schools?

Any guidance is appreciated.

Help?,TimYoung,11,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/19sinh/contract_problems_in_china_help/,"After a lot of interviews and decisions, I have narrowed down my job offers to two.  A training college in Hangzhou and another school in Zhongshen.  Both are in locations I would be happy to live in.

The Hangzhou school sent me the contract today and everything look right but there were several things I am worried about and wondered whether it is a done thing.

First of all instead of the agreed salary offered by the school to be paid monthly, the contract split it up the agreed amount into monthly salary and 'Lesson Prepare Fee'.  I asked her what it was but she was not very clear about it.  Does anybody know what it means and is this usual?  She was saying it is something to do with the time spent outside teaching or something but I think it means I would be paid the money on the condition I make them lesson plans for the school.

Secondly, there was a one month probation period where I would be paid $1000 RMB less.  I read on a website this is something I should not accept. I am not too worried about the money since it is not much but whether it is a red flag for the school?  (I have tried googling the school but cannot find any reviews.)

Thirdly, this is a biggie, there is this:
'Party A (the school) has the right to cancel the contract with a written notice to Party B (me) one month advance and claim for a breach penalty of 10,000 RMB from Party B under the following conditions.

iii)  Party B cannot pass the teaching performance evaluation process.
iv)  Party B cannot set good example for students and produces negative influences.

What I am worried about is that the clauses seems very easy for them to claim 10,000 RMB from me and to get rid whenever they want.  If they wanted to finish my contract for whatever reason, they can just say sorry you failed your teacher evaluation, 10,000 RMB please.

The thing is the person who interview me seems very geniune and nice person and I got along with her (non Chinese DoS), but I have a feeling the contract was written by Chinese management.  There were other things in the contract that gave me a bit of a cold feet like needing to use clock in cards (never had that in all the schools I teached in) and things like I need to be on call 24/7 with the mobile they gave me or I would be fined etc etc.  But the above were the main ones I am worried about most.

Anybody know if this is usual in China?

That would make perfect sense for a subreddit dedicated to, say, cellphones. In that case, blogspam is really easy to define (e.g., someone typing up a paragraph paraphrasing Motorola's 
latest press release, slapping a bunch of ads on it, and promoting it left and right) and so is commercial posting (cell phone stores, online accessory shops, etc.)

But what do those rules mean in the context of /r/tefl?

The moderator and I had a small discussion here: http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/190yr6/a_teachers_complete_guide_to_using_google_voice/c8k519c

The site I linked to was an education blog which is published under a Creative Commons license, which makes it an open educational resource and pretty much kills any commercial aspect. The post itself was original content directed toward language teachers showing them how to use a free service. No popups, no mailing lists, no click-throughs, just informative content laid out directly on the screen. And that's what educational bloggers tend to do: they try to write useful posts both to network with other educators and to provide a service to the field. There's no real way to monetize it. There's no value in mailing lists or whatever other crap commercial bloggers try to do.

Sure, sites often have ads, but I don't think any education bloggers actually make a significant stream of income from having them, let alone live off of that money. One of the major blogs I follow, Serendipity35, recently reported that despite their getting about half a million hits per month, the income from their ads is pathetically small: http://www.serendipity35.net/index.php?/archives/2731-Serendipity35-Celebrates-A-Birthday.html

And that's probably because the type of people smart enough to be drawn to teaching and to educational technology probably know how to install an ad-blocker anyway. :p

So I get the spirit of ""no blogspam"" and ""no commercial posts"", but I'm not sure how much it applies to our subject. I'm not sure what tefl blogspam would look like, to be honest, unless it were one blog rehashing the content of another blog? We're not exactly a big demographic or a consumer group.

So what do you think? What kinds of posts would make the subreddit more useful to you, and what kinds of posts ought to be excluded to keep up that signal-to-noise ratio?

So I know that some TEFL locations are better suited for savings than others (Korea for example).  I was wondering if it's possible to save up while teaching in Eastern Europe?  I'd like to do this for a few years and then go back to school in Canada and get my masters, so if I can come home with some savings it would be most useful.

I'm going to be taking the CELTA within the next few months and I'm not too worried about the academic component, but more about the teaching practice component.

Some background: I'm a recent college graduate with great grades. I majored in a foreign language, so I'm sympathetic to people learning new languages. 

I also took a class in college about teaching English as a foreign language, so I have a basic understanding of methodology, as well as basic experience planning/delivering lessons (in front of my classmates, not a real ESL class). 

Furthermore, I have a lot of experience with one-on-one tutoring, and specifically, I have experience tutoring ESL students in English. I love doing it and feel that I have been pretty effective. 

With that said, I'm not a naturally outgoing person and tend to get uncomfortable in front of large groups. I get very nervous. I love tutoring and teaching people, but I'm most comfortable doing it one-on-one. I guess others would describe me as a friendly, bookish, and approachable person, but more on the quiet side than on the loud and boisterous side.  

My question: for those of you who now teach English classes but are like me, how did you get over your fears? How did you get yourself into that mood or spirit where you can feel confident in front of a class? I've gotten great feedback from students I tutor, so I feel like I have potential as a teacher. However, I don't know how to translate that into teaching/entertaining/engaging a larger group.

For those of you who have taken the CELTA, do you think that the CELTA will help me with this?

US born, native English speaker, only fluent in English. I have also never been told that I ""sound"" Indian. I want to teach English abroad (really not married to any one particular region), ideally not in Saudi Arabia. 

I started looking into China since I have a good friend (white) who teaches there now who's having a positive experience, but have heard stories of institutional/hiring discrimination against non-whites. 

Looking through the FAQs, I see race being brought up as a significant barrier to employment in China and South Korea (and potentially one in Vietnam). 

Are there countries and/or regions I should avoid?  Conversely, are there countries/regions where race isn't a significant barrier to getting an entry level job teaching English? 

I'm OK with the day to day racism, getting stares, looked at differently, etc. as long as I can get employed. 

*Qualifications:* I have a BA (Sociology), experience tutoring (individual and group), and experience co-leading a youth summer program. 

I plan on getting TEFL certifications, but I want to make sure I have a good chance at actually getting hired somewhere before I sink money into a TEFL class.

From what others have told me and what I have gathered on here it seems that working with a recruiter that goes through EPIK is best as I will know the what school I would get and can have a chance at getting the city I want (preferably would be Seoul or Busan). 

What I am thinking would be best through my readings, is to work with at least a few recruiters to get the most offers/variety and find the best situation. I feel like this is all moving quickly but it appears that deadlines for jobs I have seen are coming up relatively quick haha. 

So please let me know, what recruiters have you found great success with or that you recommend working with?

Finally, I do have one bonus question that I can not really find a true consensus on. Do I need to get my TEFL certification? I know some have said that you do not need it in Korea and some say you do/you make more money/etc. So I am a bit confused on this part. It would definitely be nice to feel a bit prepared in going into the teaching position, however, if not totally necessary and I can still find a great position without it, then I can always get some skills and pointers from my older sister who has her masters in education and teaches kindergarten hahaha. 

Also, if it is relevant at all to whether I should get the certification or not. I am aware of the possibility that I absolutely love it in Korea and want to teach for another year. Though at the moment, this is something I am just looking at doing for a year contract to experience something new, exciting, crazy, and get to travel and experience a different culture. Any help anyone has for me is greatly appreciated.

I just graduated college with my degree in Marketing and minor in music (if either is relevant) in December of 2012. Since then I have been job hunting and had some promising interviews but no luck in getting hired. I had heard from an old friend who also just graduated college and one thing he was thinking of doing was teaching abroad in Japan where he had gotten an opportunity. 



Now I didnt think to much about it until recently. I was speaking with my mother about how I really would love to travel to South Korea, China, or Japan. She mentions the teaching abroad (not sure if she was serious or not haha) and it got me thinking. It is an experience that I likely wont be able to consider if I start working somewhere and now seems to be the time that something like this would be perfect. 



That said, I have looked into things a bit. South Korea is where I would really like to go based upon experience level required and free apt for example. 


So essentially my question is what all should I research before making a decision like this? Is there people I can talk to about what it is like/experiences? Do I have to get a TEFL cert or is my Bachelors degree sufficient? Is EPIK a good company to get a job through? I am assuming businesses would probably look upon this type of experience favorably, has that been noticed by you? Do I need to create a specific type of resume for a job teaching abroad?

* would very much prefer to teach adults (or university or higher)
* would like to be urban
* can begin any time, preferably September or August though

Given this, what would you suggest?

* good cities to live in?
* eikaiwa or ALT?
* is it a tall order to want to teach teenagers or older?
* how much can I expect to clear a month, roughly? I'm seeing around $300-$600 a month, is this correct?

Hoping for some advice. I'm currently on a 2 year work visa for the UK, but am slightly disillusioned with living here, and have decided that I would like to pursue teaching English, particularly in Eastern Europe (an area of the world I for which I hold a particular affinity) 

I have seen some postings in my research thus far, but it seems like this is going to be more of a challenge than I initially thought. 1) I am not an EU passport holder and 2) I don't have any formal teacher training...no certification. I do have a degree (BA History) and I previously held a professional job in mobile phone product management in Canada.

The thing is, I realize I could probably go to China, South Korea, Japan or Saudi Arabia (etc.) without certification, but I really would like to try living and teaching here in Europe. 

Money and the ability to save is absolutely NOT a priority for me. I simply need to earn enough to get by, pay for some basic food and accommodation. This is purely about experience and immersing myself in a new culture and profession.

So! What are my chances of securing employment? How do I go about starting? What are my realistic chances given that I don't have any certifications (not an issue for Korea etc.) I should state that I am quite open to pretty much anywhere in the east, including countries like Moldova and Albania (I have visited both prior, so yes, I know what they are like). In particular, I am fond of the Balkan countries. 

Does anyone have any general advice? Where do I look? Which countries are more realistic options, and which are a pipe dream? Any recommendation on employers to whom I could reach out? What about my non-EU citizen situation?

I'm a senior in High School, but I'm going to take a year off before I graduate to live in Argentina for foreign exchange.

Anyway, I'm getting to that age where I'm starting to weigh and consider my different options for a career.

I love English, I have always loved reading, writing, even grammar. And I think ESL would make a really cool job. I desperately want to travel the world, and do humanitarian work. Teaching English as a second language seems like a good way to accomplish those things. At the moment, I'm just trying to get a good sense of what kind of traits the job requires, the benefits and negatives, etc.


**Questions:**


**Do you find the job rewarding/satisfying?** *My biggest concern is that I'll end up unsatisfied with a career and as a result, do a bad job.*


**Where has your teaching led you? Do you have opportunities to go where you've wanted to?**


**On average, how long do your contracts with each school last?**


**Are the benefits good? (Housing, Pay, Utilities, Insurance?)**


**What are some things you don't like about your job?**

I just sent all of my documents last Friday to Korea in order to get my visa number from immigration. And then I get this message today from a guy who I have been talking to for the last month and a half (he also works at the school). 

""Hey, I can't go into detail, but I wanted to giveyou a heads up: I finished my contract with ECC on Wednesday, and they proceded to screw me over financially on my final pay. I called them out on it, and they in turn gave me a poor recommendation to my future employer. With this said, I cannot in good faith recommend working at ECC. They will make you promises, be extremely nice to your face, then fuck you over financially as you work harder than any other hagwan, for less pay. I recommend trying to find another place, and ultimately, trying to go through EPIK so you at least have some protection. Ultimately it is your call, but I thought you should know before you put everything in the states on hold for a place that treats you less fairly than you deserve. Sorry for the bad news. Hit me up if you want advice/details etc.""

So basically, it sounded like the school was ok right up until the end. Now, I have no idea what to do. I have pretty much changed my whole life in preparation for this opportunity. I had to move out of my apartment instead of renewing the lease. Roommate had to go somewhere else. And now this. Shoot. I have no job prospects in the US. I was really looking forward to leaving.

Is it possible they just didn't like the guy? Or sign of bad things to come?

UPDATE: So I got another message from the guy and he said he did get a severance, but he was upset because, according to him, it was taxed too high. I'm starting to wonder if this guy is unfairly smearing the school. More updates coming as I talk to to him. Now, I am more confused.

UPDATE 2: Another message from the guy. I wish he was more clear the first time. They charged him some pension and medical payments that they shouldn't have at the end of his contract.

I've been a TEFLer for about a year and a half now, doing the circuit out here in Ukraine (first Odessa, now Lviv).  I'm just curious to see if there are any other full-time career teachers around that have gone completely (and legitimately) private.

Over the course of the last couple years, I've seen a lot of teachers take up the occasional private student, but have always depended on a school for their main source of income and visa sponsorship.  However, I've never really met a single, professional, 100% private teacher.  I'm actually kind of surprised, really.

After having a couple terrible experiences here with language schools, I've grown to despise them and made up my mind about half a year ago to go solo or go broke trying.  Best decision ever!  It was certainly a bumpy ride at first, but it renewed my passion for the trade and has been much more profitable and comfortable ever since.

Now when I run into new TEFLers, I try to convince them to go private ASAP, but most are reluctant to the idea.  It's a lot more work upfront to set up your clientèle and to handle your own visa issues, but once you're over that hump it's fantastic.

I do speak some Spanish (which will help some in Chile, less so but at least a little in Brazil) which factors into that decision. And I've done a lot of research into these two countries, but I'm not finding a ton of info about certain topics in Brazil, like:

1) Good (and preferably cheap) TEFL schools in Brazil?

There's also a program at teachinbrazil.org, but considering the low cost and essentially no qualification process, I'm assuming it's a scam.

2) Visas? I've read getting a school to sponsor your Visa in Brazil is next to impossible, at least at my level of experience. So... how DOES one legally teach in Brazil? Any good resources?

Just completed my CELTA course, and have begun the hunt for work.

I know what things to look out for (reputation, teacher support, cost of living, e.t.c.)

And I know that I want to go to a Spanish speaking country.

But I am being bewildered by the number of job postings (on all the different sites) that exist.

I am still new to TEFL (1 year), but I'm always trying to improve. Usually that means reflecting on what goes right and wrong in my classes and adjusting. I'm trying to be a bit more proactive than that now and make the right first impression with these new students. With that in mind I humbly ask for your help with a couple things. 

 In 2 weeks I will be switching jobs. I'll still be in China but I'll be teaching at an all Korean school. I am really excited for the switch for 2 reasons. One is that I will be teaching a higher level, which has the potential to be more engaging, the other is that I am 100% in control of the direction of the classes. I have spoken with the boss and he has made it clear that I will pick text books, work books, choose or write tests and do the grading. They will provide general goals (this class is a TOEFL prep class, this one is SAT prep, this one is an academic writing class, etc) and an entire library of books to choose from.

  I am really excited for this, and I want to prepare well so I can hit the ground running, but my current experience leaves some blanks. For one, I've never worked for a Korean school or with Korean staff. Has anyone worked for both and able to give some general advice?

  For instance, my Chinese staff now are very nice, but 'friendly' is a bit of a stretch. They will talk if I ask them things, and occasionally a conversation will sprout up, but things like having lunch together, talking about personal lives (in a very general sense) or doing things together outside of work is completely foreign, and that is how the management seems to like it. Have you found that staff at Korean schools are similar? I'm hoping for a more personable relationship to be honest, but of course that will vary by person.

  There's definitely going to be a lot more planning involved with the new classes, which I am excited for. My current classes I also plan for, but it's bare bones type of stuff, and there's a lot of control from management about what gets taught and how long it should take, so my planning is pretty narrow and as a result I'm probably going to stumble a bit going to such an open ended approach. To other teachers that more or less plan classes from scratch, what kind of framework do you use for a lesson plan? I'm sure it will be different for different classes and different ages, but just a general outline would be fantastic, right now my outlines are geared for beginner to lower intermediate language learners, so a typical lesson plan will include:

some form of warm up where I can throw in a little review from last lesson, introducing new vocab, practicing a specific grammar concept and then using it with this vocab to make their own sentences and conversations depending on the age/level. I'm not looking for lessons, but I am curious if anyone knows where I could find the framework of a decent lesson plan?

What is the teaching like? How hard is it to connect with the students and inspire them to learn? How much of your time is spent thinking about helping your students succeed? What is the educational system like where you are teaching? How do you teach?

What do you do in your free time? Do you have English speaking friends? Do you make enough money to go out occasionally, maybe to travel and see the sights of your country?

I studied abroad in HK, studied a bit of Mandarin, traveled in the mainland, and studied a fair amount about Chinese culture for my bachelor's degree (anthropology), so I have a pretty good idea of what I'd be getting into culturally and linguistically.

I know Chinese universities pay less, but also require relatively low working hours, which would be great as I'd like to devote a lot of time to studying Mandarin and hanzi (Chinese writing). I'd also like to try out university teaching to help me decide if an advanced degree in applied linguistics (or related) is something I want to pursue within a couple of years--I really enjoy teaching right now, and I'm passionate about languages.

I'm just out of undergrad and currently doing a Fulbright grant, teaching English in a SE Asian country, so I'll have one year of teaching experience when I'm done, as well as some other relevant experience from while in undergrad. I don't have a teaching certificate at this point, but I have received a fair amount of training, including observed practicum, as a part of my current grant. What I'm trying to figure out is, will my qualifications be likely to get me into a university or junior college position? I know it'd probably have to be lower-tier and outside of the most major cities, but that's no problem (and I don't want to live in Beijing or Shanghai). I know Fulbright is a big plus in some countries; will this help me out in China, or is it not so well known there? I'd love to get a CELTA, though I'm not sure if I currently have the savings to do one, and doing one after my current grant would be tricky due to visa expiration and needing to do a visa run mid-course (not ideal). I'd rather not have to do some junky online cert, but could if necessary.

I am currently planning on teaching English in Korea sometime this summer/fall, and I had some questions. I also am unsure of where exactly to post this, so I apologize in advance if this isn't the proper forum per se.

That said, here's my near-exhaustive list of questions a simple google search would not do me justice for.


* What cities would you suggest? I have thought about Gwangju, Daegu, Bucheon, Busan, and Bundang, but really as long as I'm not in the middle of Seoul, I think I'll be fine. To preface this, I am not looking for a ton of nightlife activity or anything - I stay at home frequently and play video games (yes, I'm that lame). 

* Piggybacking off my last question, I have a fairly high-end desktop PC that I want to bring overseas, but am unsure of how to get it there per se. Would it be best to try shipping it over, or just cleverly packing it away amongst my baggage for the flight?

* As for powering my PC, would I be able to just get a large-scale power converter and just plug my power strip into it to run my PC, monitor, and sound system? Or would I need to get several converters?

* Back to school topics. Do you personally prefer hagwons or public schools? I am unsure of which I want to do, but I've heard that hagwons can be super shady; that said, I also don't have my TESOL certification or anything, which I understood to be a necessary component for public school positions (at least until you have experience with other schools). 

* If I were to go with a hagwon, should I use a recruiter of some sort? I found a couple supposedly reputable websites such as saykimcheerecruiting.com and teacheslkorea.com that both seem fairly ""safe"", but I don't want to take any chances really.

* I've read in several places that bringing $1000 (USD) is probably the safest thing to do, but most of those posts were from 2003 or so. Would $1000 even be enough for, say, the first 6 weeks in Korea? Obviously it also would depend on where I end up, but any ideas would be helpful.

* I am quite a large (read: overweight) fella, and am in the process of losing weight, but still quite large. I have heard a couple instances of superficiality when it comes to the hiring process, as well as how awkward it can be to live in Korea and be so grossly overweight as most of the population is tiny. I understand shopping for clothes and shoes and such will be an issue, but other than that, will I honestly have much trouble because of my weight?

* Similar to my previous question, I heard there is a medical check to be performed upon arriving in Korea, and that potentially you could ""fail"" said medical check (HIV postive or drugs seem to be the biggest issues I read about). Would my weight and probably unhealthy blood pressure or other potential issues give them cause to send me home? Or is it really just a precaution to ensure I don't snort cocaine every day or had sex with monkeys?

* I have facial piercings as well as wrist tattoos, and I understand it's a bit taboo to have either (at least as an English teacher). I can easily enough take out my piercings, but would like to wear them around town. Would this be an issue with my potential employers (both the tattoos and the piercings)?

* Public schools vs. Hagwons aside, would getting TESOL certification be advantageous for teaching anyway? Where would you suggest getting it done (preferably online)?


I think that's it for now. Obviously my curious mind is racing constantly, and it's hard to keep certain things in focus. Any help would be appreciated, as I pursue this most daunting task.

My partner and I have recently been offered contracts for teaching in a high school in Guangzhou, China. Most of the contract looks good; however there are a few things we wanted to address and negotiate for and any advice from folks that have had experience doing this would be much appreciated. We both have master's degrees from a Canadian university and TESOL certificate and one year experience working as teaching assistants in Canada. 

1. Currently we are being offered 11,000RMB/month, initially we were told we would be offered 12,000RMB, based on the research I've done this seems like a good salary for 40 hours a week of work, do you think it is appropriate to ask for a slightly higher salary? 

2. The rent for our apartment is being covered and right now it says we are expected to pay our utilities. Should we ask for them to cover the utilities? How hard is it to figure out how to set up utilities and get internet, etc. in China? Is there anything else we should be aware of regarding our accommodations? It was suggested that we ask them to write into our contract that if we did not find the apartment they provided suitable that we would be given a specific monthly allowance to find our own housing. Has anyone done this before and did it work out? 

3. They want us to be in China very quickly, like in the next 2 weeks, and have asked to get tourist visas and then they will arrange for our work visas when we get over there. Do you think this is ok? 

Any other advice or things we should look out for or ask about would be greatly appreciated!

I have been riddled with depression nearly my entire life, and it's been a struggle trying to find something to do or work towards to. Frankly, I have no ambition and no motivation, which makes for a very bad combination. 

I was in my first year of college, taking B.S. Psychology, when I attempted to take my own life, which subsequently cancelled all my hopes of getting my degree. Ironic, isn't it? Recently, in trying to get me out of the house, a friend mentioned that his daughter had taken a TEFL course and has been teaching English in Vietnam. He suggested I give it a thought, and I have. I am now all set in taking a 4-week on-site TEFL course in Cebu City, which I found through the [ITTT] (http://www.teflonline.net/).

I am, in not so many words, nervous.

I am a dual citizen (British-Filipina) and I have lived most my life in the Philippines. Now, I want to get out and go somewhere (anywhere really, though I'd like to avoid SE Asia) and live my life. I'd like to travel and find meaning to my existence, while still actually earning an income. I do believe that getting a TEFL certificate will not only aid me in my battle against depression, but also inject me with some sort of self-worth. 

I don't know if this is something I'd like to do on a long-term basis, but I really won't know until I give it a try. The fact of the matter is that I am putting everything I have on the line in this endeavour. I am scared and confused, but at this point, I have nothing left to lose and so I must go on.

I'm sure some of you are wondering what the whole point of this post was. I'd like some insight on how you knew you wanted to teach to foreign students? What were the difficulties you experienced emotionally, and how did you overcome them? How difficult will it be for me to find a job without a degree and with my psychological history?

What is the real reason you chose TEFL as a career, or in some cases, as a short-term job opportunity? Are you attracted to the money? Are you just doing it because it's the easy way out?

I have found that so many people who work in ESL/multicultural services, including teachers (whether in US/Canada/non-English speaking countries/etc), administrative staff or International Students Services staff, simply do not seem to care that much about the students. Many times, I've felt a certain condescension that I did not expect from somebody in this industry. All in all, the impression I get is that they simply do not care enough and seem to be just doing this routine without a genuine love of teaching. I have had good teachers but not in the ESL department. I know what good teaching is, but sadly many ESL teachers and especially, administrators fail to convey that. Many of them need to understand the large impact ESL program staff have on international students/students in any country that employs foreign ESL teachers. We'll remember it for life, and having a bad teacher means that we not only have bad English for life, but have a negative impression of the teacher's home country. It might even discourage a student from attempting to improve their English, and refrain from speaking it, choosing instead to converse in their native language as much as possible.

This is not saying there are no good ESL teachers. I have had friends who's teachers were great and who still keep in touch with their teachers. All I'm saying that it gets on my nerves when I see the kinds of posts in this thread, with people going on lengthily about the money and the perks that come with the position. Worst is the thought that since you all are native speakers, you're born with the ability to teach English to foreigners and there's no need to exert much effort. It shows when you think that way, because damn it's not that easy to teach English to people who know nothing about the language. You NEED to come up with solid lesson plans, or else we literally will not learn anything.

I have taught ESL before.

It sounds a little strange, but it is the situation I am feeling I am in. I obtained my ESL Certificate a number of years ago (2005) as well as a Bachelor of Arts. (2010) I earned both from Canadian Post Secondary institutions and am an English first language Canadian born citizen and am fluent in French. (I did part of my university studies at a Francophone/French only school)

I have taught English classes in East Africa on volunteer basis, which went swimmingly. Classes were both well received by students and their family members and I felt confident in the position teaching older kids.

I am currently on the tale end of a second year Working Holiday visa in Australia, where I had spent six months of that teaching at an unnamed, but widely known ESL school. I was teaching older, mostly European, students who were in the same age group as the kids in East Africa though it just did not jive for me and left quite a bitter taste in my mouth, so to speak, and I had some pretty neg. behavior and feedback from some students. (French, in particular) Other students preformed great, improved their language skills a lot and it just clicked. Following that, I moved down to teach younger, (10-13) mostly Chinese students. Again, it went swimmingly. Lots of fun with the students, good improvement and great feedback. However,  I did leave the school on a sour note with some paperwork issues regarding visas and such... Leaving a pretty bad feeling, again.

Now, my visa is coming to an end and I am looking at my next options. Heading back to Canada where I am originally from (and unemployment is up to 22%!!) or taking the leap back into full time teaching, with some fear of not being a strong enough teacher.

I am considering staying with slightly younger students, 10-15 maybe who are not complete beginners up to intermediate. I enjoy having a lot of fun in my classroom by using music and other activities. Is this too specific? If not, is there a particular place that is good to go to? I don't enjoy the idea of dealing with helicopter mum, but want them to be able to see language skills growing.

I would, ideally, like to make enough money to live comfortably, have a bit of travel and put some payments onto those pesky student loan payments.

I am also a lesbian woman. I am not a stereotype ""OMG, look at her, she's so gay"" lesbian, so I can fly under the radar, but I would like to be open with at least my western co-workers and not worry about my safety as I did in some places in Africa. (No matter how much I loved Africa, stressful!)  As for social life, I like to go out for food and drinks on some nights, but I'm past the stay up all night to party part of life.

I did have Thailand in my head as an option, but an ex taught in Korea and is absolutely convinced I should go. China seems like where people go, but I just wasn't all over the idea. I am not keen on a 4 million person city, I've been too much of a small town/small city girl.

Firstly apologies for the block of text.  I've been thinking a lot about my future lately and would really appreciate your insight.

I am currently trying to decide on what steps to take next.  I'm torn between three options...each has advantages and disadvantages.

Firstly a little information about me and my situation.....I'm currently teaching English in China. I first found out about this career when handing in my dissertation at university (I have a B.A. degree in history). After researching this further I completed a CELTA course and have been in China ever since. I'm having a really good time here (2 years so far).  However, if I'm honest with myself, there's not much of a future here for me.

So onto my dilemma. The way I see it, I have three options, each with their pros and cons:

*Stay where I am*

**Pros**

I like it here.  I have a stable job, good students, good boss and relaxed lifestyle.  I feel comfortable.


**Cons**

No professional development (I could be doing the same job for the next 10 years and little would change).  
Low pay.

*Teach somewhere else*

**Pros**

I could work somewhere which would allow professional development.  Somewhere with experienced teachers/teacher trainers hopefully.  
I'd see a different part of the world.
Better pay(?)

**Cons**

The job may be terrible.
The location may be terrible.

*Study for an M.A.*

**Pros**

Much better career prospects.  
Become a better teacher.

**Cons**

Expensive.
I may not pass - this is my biggest worry, that my subject knowledge simply isn't up to it.

What I do know is that I would like to study for an M.A. sometime in the future, I just don't know when.  With an M.A. in TESOL (or related field) I see this as not only the gateway to the world but as a providing for a stable future.

My main worry is that my knowledge of the English grammar is severely lacking. This may sound odd to those of you who will think, 'but you're teaching English', the thing is, that in China, the vast majority of English teachers focus only on Oral English. Which is why experience in China isn't counted for much elsewhere in the world.

Most M.A. courses I've looked at state 2 year's teaching experience as a requirement.  I barely have that and in a part of the world which doesn't have the highest standards... I fear I may be rushing into things when I'm not ready.  At the same time though I think it's fear that's holding me back (fear of failure - I've never been confident, at anything in life - I wanted to drop out of university as I thought I'd fail, but I got a first class degree).  

So I'd really like to hear your opinions.  Especially those of you on/have completed an M.A. in Applied Linguistics/TESOL (or related area - there's a lot of acronyms in this game!). And especially about your background (degree, experience, qualifications etc.) and your knowledge of grammar/English before the course began.

However last night the anxiety started to creep in and I've now become unsure if I still want to do this. Deciding to research some more about people teaching in South Korea, I've heard some real horror stories of school directors coercing people with threats of deportation or jail time. I would like to believe that these are exaggerations brought on by those who did not fully understand what they were signing on to, but then again I do not know a great deal about Korea; at least as well as someone who was born and raised there.

So yeah, really not sure why I am typing this. I guess I'd like to know about people who have taught, or are teaching English in South Korea. Is it (relatively) safe? I know no job is perfect, there will be rough spots, but is there any truth to these horror stories I see cropping up everywhere?

I'm an American expat currently living in Jordan. I have recently been offered a great opportunity to possibly begin teaching English here. Although I have never seriously considered becoming an English teacher, this offer has made me think twice. Since I have no prior experience or certifcation I will start out as an assistant to a teacher, however there is ample room for advancement, which I would be very willing to dedicate myself to. 

So that brings me to here! I would very much appreciate any help or suggestions as to what would be the best way to begin getting TEFL certified? Are there any practice tests/material I could study online? Does anyone have any experience teaching English in the middle east?

I've been teaching English to older immigrants as a volunteer (45-75 years old, from a variety of places; the class size ranges from 3 to 10) for a couple months now, and I'm feeling increasingly lost. I felt like I had an okay handle on things, but now that I have better identified my students' needs, I'm having trouble figuring out what I should be teaching them.

Most of my students have an okay (between mid novice or mid intermediate) grasp of listening and speaking, but aren't very practiced at creating full grammatical sentences (""What did you do today?"" - ""Me same thing every day, me cook, watch baby""). They struggle a lot with reading and writing, as many have never had any formal training in English.

I've tried playing games and roleplaying, but it is very difficult to have them roleplay or play games because they cannot understand the instructions very well.

My superior is not trained in ESL (and mostly just yells at students when they don't understand her), and has basically just told me to teach the class. She wants them to know their address, phone number, and the alphabet, which they all already know. I have virtually no materials beyond a couple word lists, and I have no prior experience teaching English. I don't have access to a copier, but I can print some pages using my own money. I do have a whiteboard, but I don't have any real multimedia capabilities. I don't think I can give out homework, but I'd be willing to try and see how it goes.

I plan as of now is to present short basic English stories to them, have them read the story out loud, answer questions, and do short dictations on important words, though I don't know if this is what is best for me to do.

I teach two one hour-long classes a week, and each of those are usually followed by an hour of a private-lesson-style lesson. Do you have any suggestions of what I should be teaching them? Or suggestions on *how* to teach? Or just suggestions? ;P

I'm contemplating / toying with the idea of relocating to Thailand, for many reasons really. I just wholeheartedly think I could be much happier there, and it appears that it'd be much easier for me to live within my means. Combined with the fact I am young (24), I don't see why I shouldn't give it a shot!

With that said, I'm interested in obtaining my TEFL certification, but as the title may suggest I don't have a college degree. I could rant on and on about how I don't wish to obtain one, something about the idea of putting myself in financial debt until my hair is gray just so I -may- be able to get some sub-par management job somewhere isn't appealing to me. Instead, I do some online work and do okay money wise.

Teaching wouldn't be my main source of income in Thailand, but it'd be a helpful chunk. I guess I am just overly concerned about spending money taking a TEFL course, getting certified, and then having trouble finding employment due to my lack of a 'regular' college degree. I know in Thailand that MANY people fake degrees and provide false documents to potential employers, many get away with it. But that's not something I'd ever feel comfortable doing, and I'm not that desperate for a job anyhow.

So, someone please shed some light on this issue and hopefully reassure me that it's going to be all okay.

Secondly, when does the very first paycheck come to me? After a month? Two? How much money should I bring to sustain myself until then?

Thirdly, in regards to the holidays mentioned (Spring Festival, summer holiday and National Day), do those last more than a day? Obviously National Day sounds like just a day, but is Spring Festival a longer occasion?

Foreign Teacher’s Contract of Employment
2313017-12-013

1.	This contract shall be initiated from _________________________ to facilitate the employer’s application for a Chinese working permit. ( The contract period is from _____________________,. The extra days are for the employee to prepare leaving China if the employee does not resign the contract).
2.	The employer maintains the rights to increase or decrease the number of classes, modify the curriculum, or alter the teaching schedule or the office hours of the employee in accordance with the quality and cooperation of the employee.
4.	For the employee to attain a working visa through the Chinese government, one criteria is that the employee passes a physical exam.  It is the employee’s responsibility to complete the physical exam in their home country.  If not all portions of the exam are complete and the Chinese government issues the employee a temporary work visa to allow them to travel to China, the employee must still complete the exam to be issued a permanent visa.  If the employee fails the final health exam or any other portion of the visa process, then it is the employee’s responsibility to return to their home country at their own cost.  The Chinese government will not issue a permanent work permit for the employee and therefore Joy School will not be able to employ them.  
5.	Unless approved by the employer, the employee will not be allowed to take on any work outside of Joy School.  If the employee fails to follow this accord, the employee shall take full legal responsibility and pay any costs incurred from the cancellation of the Chinese work permit.
6.	In the case where the employee violates the laws of China, the employee shall be responsible for the compensation of all damages sustained by the employer resulting from the deportation or criminal punishment of the employee.
7.	The employee attests that all information given to the school regarding personal data and education qualifications is accurate and true.
8.	The employee shall participate in all evaluations conducted by the employer.  If the employee fails two evaluations during the contracted period of time, the employer retains the right to terminate the contract.
9.	The employer retains the right to terminate the contract at any time if the employee repeatedly violates school policy such as lateness, absences, inadequate class preparations, or inappropriate work-place behavior and conduct. The employee needs to hand in your passport to the office and the school will change the working visa into traveling visa, and the school will cancel the employee's Expert Certificate. 
10.	Aside from teaching, the employee is responsible for attending and  
participating in workshops, school promotions and other activities in and outside of the schools.  When required, the employee may be expected to give training to the Chinese teachers.  Training hours given to Chinese teachers will be calculated as regular teaching hours.
11.	The employer shall not cover the cost of transportation for the employee traveling to and from schools.
12.	The employer provides accident insurance for the employee.

SALARY
1.	The employee shall be paid 6000RMB per month for the first and second month (probation period) then 6500RMB per month from the third to sixth month and 7000RMB per month from the seventh month to the end of the contract term.  Maximum teaching hours will be 80 hours per month (besides vacation months) and four office hours a week.
2.	Salary is paid monthly on the 15th of each month for the previous months work.  Salaries are direct deposited into accounts which the employer has setup for each employee.  Cash salary payments might be an option if there are any banking issues with the employer.  In this case employees would be required to attend the Head-Quarters for payment.
3. The employee has the right to refuse new hours if his/her workload has reached or exceeded 80 teaching hours per month(besides vacation months).  If the employee agrees to teach more than 80 hours per month, he/she shall be paid 80RMB for every hour over 80 (besides vacation months, vacations months calculation method see VACATION).
4. If the employee is working less than 80 hours a month (office hours are not included), the employer may assign outside work or other various teaching-related tasks until the employee’s hours reach 20 per week. The employee cannot refuse to work in these cases.

VACATION
During every year of the contract term, there are three major holidays: Spring Festival, Joy’s Summer Holiday, and National Day Holiday.  They are a total of 37 days for these holidays.  Half of the vacation days will be paid and the payout will occur at the end of the contract. The teaching hours before and after each vacation are calculated by average. (eg: (86 hours January+56 hours February)÷2=71hours, so no extra pay for January and February)  The employee can have one day off on the weeks before and after these holidays. The other unpaid holidays are: May 1st , Children’s Day, New Year’s Day, Mid- Autumn Day and Christmas Day. You may have one day off on these holidays.

ACCOMODATION
View Appendix C for details. 
QUARTERLY BONUS

The employer shall pay the employee a 4000RMB bonus every three months, which is based on the employee's quarterly attendance or working behavior and conduct. View Appendix B and D for details.

CONTRACT TERMINATION
This contract shall automatically terminate upon contract expiration. Both parties shall enter into a new contract if both parties agree to do so. The employee shall notify the employer in written form of his/her willingness to renew or not renew a contract at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the current contract.  The employer shall do the same. Both parties are expected to read and agree with the terms set forth in the attached APPENDIX A (Foreign Teacher Instructions) and APPENDIX B (Contract Bonus).  Anything not included in the contract shall be practiced in accordance with the rules and regulations of the People’s Republic of China.  This contract is in duplicate, each in both Chinese and English versions, and both shall take effect upon being signed at the same time.

APPENDIX A
FOREIGN TEACHER INSTRUCTIONS
ATTENDANCE
1.	Teachers are required to be at school at least 30 minutes before classes begin.
2.	Teachers should not be late for class. If the teacher is less than ten minutes late for class and no other teacher is covering the class, the teacher is expected to go to the class, yet will only receive half pay for the time taught. If the teacher is more than ten minutes late or if there is already a different teacher covering the class, the late teacher shall receive no pay for that class.
3.	Teachers are required to spend two “office hours” a week, to a maximum of four hours a week, in each school they teach at to prepare the following weeks lessons. 
4.	Teachers are expected to participate in activities such as school promotions、 demonstrations or out-field trip, both in and out of school. These hours are counted towards the total weekly teaching hours.
5.	Teachers are expected to attend and participate in the monthly workshops. Workshop hours are not included in the total weekly working hours.
EXCUSED  LEAVE
Lacking reasons, the employees are not allowed to leave for private affairs unless permission is received from the employer. The employer retains the right to terminate the contract if the employee is found absent without a notice. The employees are expected to notify the school as early as possible if they are unable to attend class because of illnesses or other private issues. The employees will not be paid for hours missed.  At the same time, the employees’ quarterly evaluation points will be taken away. View APPENDIX B for details. If classes are made-up, the hours will be calculated into their pay but only if overtime hours are reached will they recover those missed hour’s salary. 
IN THE CLASSROOM
1.	In each class there will be a Chinese co-teacher. Teachers should discuss lessons with the co-teacher before each class. Advice should also be sought, during office hours, from the co-teachers as they are much more familiar with the classes than the foreign teachers. Co-teachers are not there to act as a translator. Foreign teachers should be teaching the class independently and need speak to or seek advice from the co-teacher before the class.
2.	At the end of each three-month term, students will receive an oral examination given by the foreign teacher. The examination should take one teaching hour and administered in the regular class’ hour. If a student misses the exam, or re-takes it, the foreign teacher is expected to make up the test. These make up exams are unpaid, it will usually take just a few minutes and can be done during the foreign teacher’s office hour.
3.	For each lesson, the teacher is expected to prepare a Joy-formatted lesson plan on the provided lesson plan sheets. The lesson plans should be given to the Chinese co-teacher at the end of each class. Lesson plans should not be photocopied and re-used for later classes.
4.	In order to prepare lessons, the teacher must borrow books, teaching guides, DVDs, VCDs and other teaching materials from the front desk of each school. The teachers should fill in the appropriate lending forms and are expected to return the items promptly after use. Teachers will be responsible for paying for lost materials.
5.	Joy has a collection of cassettes, VCDs and CDs that can be used during office hours for practicing songs or chants. Because Joy specializes in American English, teachers are highly recommended to listen to the cassettes before class to avoid pronunciation confusion with the students.
APPENDIX B
The quarterly bonus distribution for the Foreign Teachers issued by Joy Children’s Language School.
1.	Bonus Amount:
Maximum quarterly bonus is 4,000RMB.
2.	Bonus Distribution Time
The bonus is paid-out to the employee on 15th of April,   July, October, and January. Amount of bonus is directly related to the class attendance, class accidents, lateness and missed office hours, workshops, events and make-up classes. 
3.	Scores and Values Calculations--Scores are based on a 100-point system
a.	Any scores between 100 and 70 will be calculated by percentage. For each point, 40RMB will be deducted.
b.	Any scores of 70 and below will be an automatic deduction of 50% of the total quarterly bonus of 4000 RMB for a maximum bonus of 2000RMB.
c.	Any scores of 60 and below will automatically cause the loss of the entire quarterly bonus. 
4.	When late for school the first time 20rmb will deducted from your salary.  Second time late, 40rmb will be deducted.  Third time, 60rmb will be deducted. After this each time you are late 60rmb will be deducted.
5.	The employee is required to sign in and sign out when you arrive or leave the schools. If the employee forgets to sign in or sign out, 10RMB will be deducted from your salary the first time, 20RMB the second time, 30RMB the third time and after this each time you forget to sign in or sign out 30RMB will be deducted. 
6.	The bonuses are calculated and paid out on the 15th of April, July, October, and January for the previous 3 months (quarter).  If in the first part of your contract you work for 60 or more days within that quarter, the full bonus will be calculated starting in this first quarter.  But, if you work fewer than 60 days within that quarter, no bonus will be calculated in the first quarter of your contract and the full quarterly bonus will be paid for the last quarter of your contract.
For example the first quarter is January 1st to March 31st and paid on April 15th.  If you start your contract after January 31st  you will have worked for less than 60 days of that quarter so you will not receive the bonus during this time period.  You will receive the bonus for the last quarter of the year/contract instead.
7.	The head teacher in each school is in charge of all your teaching issues and your work-place behavior.

I graduate in December. I'm hoping for some sort of university job to start me out, aiming for the Feb/March season. I've read in places that I want to get paperwork and such done before late January, as the Chinese New Year comes and schools tend to shut down.

My question is whether I should start applying for stuff now, when I don't have my degree certificate (since I've not yet graduated) or wait until mid-December when I will have graduated and have the certificate, but have less time before the Chinese New Year.

I have a lot of questions, particularly about my chances of finding work in both Western Europe and Latin America. ",sjensen88,8,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/101kai/okay_im_taking_the_celta_in_chicago_in_october_i/,"24(f), I graduated two years ago with a Bachelor's degree in Paralegal Studies thinking I wanted to go to law school. That changed, and now I want to TEFL and travel the world for a long while. I am open to the possibility of getting a Masters in English or TESOL and turning this into a career if I really enjoy it. Ideally I would like to get my Masters abroad, since the cost of tuition in the US is outrageous. 

I took 12 years of French in school growing up but I'm very rusty so I'd say my level at this moment is an A2. If I brushed up on my French I could probably come up to a B1 or B2 by next fall. In other words I have lots of random French knowledge built up in my head but using it is a totally different thing.

I'm taking the CELTA next month and then I'm going to work in Chicago for a year to save up as much money as I can for my travels. During that time I will also work on gathering up important documents and doing what I have to visa-wise. First question: Do I need to get an FBI background check? I read that somewhere on reddit and they were saying it's a LONG process. 

I'm writing all this because I know everyone says it's almost impossible for a US citizen to gain TEFL employment in Western Europe. But I'm very interested in going to France because of my time learning French, and I'm also very interested in living in Spain or Italy. (As far as Spain goes, I'm not okay with working illegally.) I don't mind not making a whole lot of money, I know the only place right now where TEFL is lucrative is S. Korea. But I'm not interested in S. Korea at all. Thailand would be great but it's not my first choice. I am also interested in Latin America. Argentina, Chile and Brazil to be specific. I know the money over there isn't good either but I'm obviously not pursuing this path for the money. I am also open to Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Croatia, Turkey - would these countries be easier to find jobs in? Would it be easier to start out in Eastern Europe and work my way west? Are there any particular countries in Europe that are needing ESL teachers right now? 

Realistically, how much of a shot do I have in getting a job in any of the countries I mentioned? Do I have to fly there first on a tourist visa and then look for jobs? I'm very uncomfortable with that idea. I hate that the countries I really want to visit are mostly in the Schengen zone and the visa process is impossible. I have looked into TAPIF, but like I said my French isn't at a B1 level right now and the application process looks daunting. Can I take a written test instead of an oral exam? I can read and write French far better than I can speak it.

I have looked at fusac and seriousteachers.com. Are these websites really that credible? I mean, is this a good way to submit CVs? Are people actually successful at landing jobs this way? And are they good jobs? It just seems so crazy that you could get a job from thousands of miles away through those kind of sites. Do most employers want an in-person interview? Are there any more sites like seriousteachers but perhaps more reputable, where I can post my resume?

I have an acquaintance who taught English in Brazil, then Czech Republic, and now she is in France. But she has ZERO certification. I think she majored in Linguistics at school though. But how does this happen? Does it get a bit easier to gain employment after you've had that first job? 

I've tried to do as much research as I can, but with different countries having different obstacles and requirements, I'm having a lot of trouble wrapping my head around all of this. It's also making it harder for me to choose a country. I just feel like my options are becoming more and more limited.

Long of the short, its my dream to get over there in Fall 2013.  I was never able to afford study abroad in college, and its the one things I want to do in life.  

I just want to make sure that I can get over there.  

On the off chance that EPIK standards get TOO high, how do I go about finding a good hagwon that is reliable and won't treat me like dirt?

* book ""ESL/EFL Teaching: Principles for Success"" - This looks OK as background, and it's good that it's simply written, but it still might be too complex for my father right now, and it doesn't look like it would be instantly applicable.
* book ""The ESL/ELL Teacher's Book of Lists"" - Looks comprehensive.  I'm unsure whether it would be easy enough to use.  It looks like it provides raw materials more than ready-to-go exercises.
* workbook ""200+ Games for the Foreign Language Classroom"" - There's no preview or reviews for this, but it looks like the kind of thing that might help my father, if its quality is good.
* book ""Teaching English as a Foreign Language For Dummies"" - What I liked about this one was that it has a short section - 50 pages - on teaching grammar, which my father doesn't have any experience with.  Whether those 50 pages are something my father is in a position to get his head around, I'm not sure. Apart from that section, it didn't look very useful for his particular situation.

Part of the issue here is that I'm hoping I can give him some stuff that might help, but I'm a little concerned about giving him something too complex that could end up being discouraging.

So I'm trying to start a new trend here where I will bring to the table an interesting issue for us TEFL professionals to discuss and reflect upon. If you guys like it, I'll try to keep doing it. Let me know what you think.  
  
So the first topic I want to raise is something I might end up doing a project on.  When teaching in a foreign country, should the foreign teacher adopt their style of teaching to that the host country? Or is it better for the students to learn in a style that reflects the culture of the language they are learning?  
  
I have in front of me a number of journal articles about English teaching in China, and although I haven't read most of them, the abstracts seem to point out that foreign teachers are not sensitive enough to the cultural styles of the country they are teaching in.  For example, Chinese students often take English classes to pass exams. Speaking is not a big requirement for them, and many native English speakers (NES) focus on speaking which is detrimental to the students' primary goals.  Although a NES might think that a student should be good at speaking, they must consider what the *students* goal is as well. Here are some quotes from *Teach English in China: Conflicts and Expectations* by Siping Liu published by The International Journal - Language, Society and Culture in 2010:  
  
When discussing why Chinese students are not vocal in class Liu writes
&gt;Chinese students usually believed that questions indicated that the teacher didn't explain clearly and any questions to challenge the teacher would make him or her lose face in front of the whole class.  
Regarding teaching styles
&gt;Chinese students learn better if they can learn in their own way: start with rote memorization, grammar rules, sentence construction and then worry about conversation and shades of meaning  
  
From *Cultural Factors Affecting Chinese ESL Students' Academic Learning* by Jinyan Huang published in Education #129 Summer 2009 she writes that this is due to the historical context of Chinese learners and how the Chinese education system has been examination-driven since Confucius' time (the imperial examinations). Studying ""The Five Classics"" and ""The Four Books"" didn't cease until 1905 so its no surprise to see that cultural mentality still lingering in Chinese society.  
  
So what do you think?  Should we force Western notions of education on non-Western cultures or should we adapt to their cultural style and try to be more accomodating for their goals and aspirations?",,False,self,t5_2qq76,False,,,True,t3_pil94,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/pil94/tefl_issues_lets_discuss/,

Unluckily searching online has provided a lot of differing opinions and a bit of an information overload so I was wondering if I could ask some questions to anyone with experience?

Mainly I was wondering about TEFL certificates, I'm a little confused at all the different types available and whether one is even needed for a job? I assume one would help but I have seen people write that they managed to teach without them. I'm also a bit wary of some of the TEFL course providers like ""I to I"" who offer cheap TEFLs, If anyone knows about the validity of courses like these in the U.K. (or has recommendations) it would be a great help

Secondly I wanted to ask about the time of year to apply/go as I assume that jobs will revolve around school term times (Which I think are different for Japan from Europe/U.S.A? not sure about Korea).

and finally I wanted to ask redditors who have taught/are teaching about the TEFL they got, or if they got one at all?

Add to that the learning curve involved when you're thrown into a classroom and told to teach without being given any kind of support (not all jobs, but a couple in the beginning were this way).

And the shock of not having access to some of the things I loved most (Raisin Bran, cold drinks, light beer, Mexican food)...

Those were all learning experiences (except the food bit - it still sucks), but now, years later, the hardest thing is being away from family in the U.S. This is because I'm married to a Korean woman and we have a 3-year-old daughter and another on the way. I want my kids to go to school in the U.S. and experience our traditions - Thanksgiving, Halloween, hell even St. Patrick's day.

I'm a newly-certified TEFLer who is trying to get his first teaching position in China.  I've read that the best jobs are at universities and I have an offer from a university in China which sounds great, but I was wondering if a few of you TEFL veterans would be kind enough to answer a few questions that I have before I fully commit.

-The contract doesn't mention anything about a Z-visa.  I've read that I shouldn't accept a contract that doesn't freely provide this.  Is the Z-Visa assumed?

-The contract mentions that I cannot ""render service elsewhere"" without the university's consent.  Does this rule out private teaching on the side (I'm kind of counting on that income)?

-Would there be a lot of support for a newbie teacher?  This would be my first TEFL job.

-Does anything else look abnormal?


Also, I was wondering if any of you veterans here might have advice on learning how to lesson plan/plan a semester's worth of teaching for the first time.  My certification course didn't really include a teaching component, and while I'm pretty sure I can manage the in-class teaching well, I still have very little idea how to plan out lessons weeks/months in advance.  Any suggestions that might help me to hit the ground running?  I'm terrified that I'll arrive in China and the school officials will ask me for my lesson plans and I will have no idea what to do.  Would you recommend a university for a first teaching job, or should I go with a private english school that provides all of your lessons in advance?  Thanks so much, and sorry for the wall of text/wall of contract.

Would that online TEFL course be worth it?

November to apply whether or not I do the TESOL course.

- Safety? I've heard a really mixed bunch of reports. Despite the obvious, ""Don't prick around at night"", how safe is PP for a Westerner?


- How easy is it **really** to get a job with a wage that could afford  a decent living there, while holding a TEFL? Extra advice on doing so?


- I've seen a few ads from other Westerners looking for flat sharing partners. Has anybody experience with this?

- What's the best district to live, and work in?

- I've heard Asia Pacific International School, Home of English and ACE are the more favourable schools to work in, any more to add?

- How are living standards for a reasonably paid English teacher? In terms of happiness levels too, I guess.


- How is the nightlife for a Westerner?

- I've heard a few sources say that you can buy your VISA on the plane. I understand VISA laws aren't too tight here, but how true is this? What VISA should I be actually flying in with - A tourist one, perhaps?

- Are there reliable banks for foreigners? Is work paid through a bank account, or cash in hand?

I'm open to the suggestion of other countries/areas to work in with TEFL. I've been looking around however and it doesn't seem all too bright - China was mentioned as an (illegal) option, but the possibility of getting screwed over seemed fairly high.

You know that hot sweaty moment of fear as you are descending into a foreign land with your testicles curled up inside you as you envision the hell that is to come?

And then you get off the plane at Incheon airport and your boss isn't there...

Yeah that happened to me.. damn boss.

Anyway, what stuck with me the most was the SHEER HOWLING stupidity of 2005 me. I showed up in Korea with 100 dollars in my pocket and all the clue of a Snooki on a hair spray overdose. 

My first job, lasted one week. I was with a winter camp that was on the tail end of a massive food poisoning outbreak that caused a cattle stampede of students who fled for their lives. 

I was damn fortunate, my sister was in Korea at the time. Up in Ilsan, and she not only picked my jet-lagged ass up at the airport, she pulled her two lovely South African friends out of bed to drive all the way to Incheon to fetch me. I went on to enjoy several very good Vegetarian meals with those two zany South Africans and had some great conversations about religion with the wife, lovely lady. 

My sister helped me find another job, it was a good job. I was incredibly fortunate to get that job. But.. what if I had ended up in the deep grinding bowels of hogwan hell? I couldn't have gone a single damn place, my sister returned to the US a month after I arrived. I would have been trapped getting ddongchimmed all day long and not have been able to do a thing about it until I saved up money to pull a runner. 

To cut to the chase, as I accidentally deleted half of what I consider to be an epic post, just how much Beep- you money do you have snizzled away?

My formula:

Flight + rent for 3 months  + food + blow= (beep you money)

I'm currently sitting on my beep you money, it's stashed in a money belt under my chair cushion. I've got enough to make it home, find a cheap apartment or room, and enough to feed me if I'm careful for a few months while I sort out what is next.

This is what security is in ESL. You provide your own security net or maybe your parents if you are lucky. 

Please, all you new folks, sit down and look in the mirror and repeat after Captainenema... 

""Do I have enough money to survive the unsurvivable torment of 30 snot covered kids who are apt to try shoving their fingers in my various holes and cracks while my boss pays me late, screws me on my hours, and forces me to live in an apartment 3 doors down from a knocking shop?"" 

ESL isn't for anyone, but for some it's a great life. I enjoy it, though I'm a raging INFP, meaning I change my mind every five @#$#ing minutes. Ask Tarkaan, he'll vouch, last week it was Mexico, this week it is (fill in the blank). 

But the constant we all face is being in a foreign land and being subject to exploitation.

So how much beep you money do you have stashed? 

And look, your parents really don't count, because if shit goes sideways for them where does that put you?

The second student also has a fairly good understanding of spoken English, but finds speaking difficult. He told me he can speak like Tarzan ""Me...want...eat...now"" but would like to work on his fluency. 

The third student is nearly a beginner. He can speak a little English but as far as I could tell when I met him, he understood only a little of what I said, the other two translated into Spanish for him.

1-Ability to speak German? The consensus I'm seeing is that German ability isn't necessary, but I'm wondering does it help?

------------------------------

2-TEFL certification? I'm seeing contradictory things here. One person I've spoken to, and some stuff I've seen suggests that you don't need any kind of formal certificate to get started teaching English in Germany so long as you have a bachelor's. I also see a lot of places saying that it is EXTREMELY useful or even necessary. The latter sources though tend to be the same companies that are trying to sell you the certification course, which makes me question how impartial that advice is. So I'm wondering will it make a difference? Particularly as I try to set aside some funds in order to survive until I can start making a livable income, if I decide I want some kind of certificate that means I won't have as much of those funds, but the trade off, perhaps, is that I will get more and better work. I suspect the truth is inbetween, but am curious how useful it is.

It seems like paying a small amount isn't worth the paper it's printed on, but paying a large amount might just be a money sink. Those are my concerns at least.

-----------------------------

3-Visa process. This is where I tend to see the same information, but I want to make sure, because for me it is the scariest part. I have heard the best way to do this, essentially is to just go there, find a place to live and start applying. As an American I can move there and start looking for work on a Schengen pass and once I have a job offer, I can apply for a residency/work permit. Most TEFL-companies won't hire you beforehand is my understanding. Also, therefore, it's my understanding that you cannot apply for the visa beforehand. Just want to make sure I get that process correctly. I'm not too terribly, terribly worried as I am quite frugal/minimalist and worst case scenario I get a 3-month holiday as I intend to save enough to have return airfare and money to live on for 5-6 months. The only exception I'm seeing is coming from some smaller TEFL-Cert places that claim they can place you in Germany, but I am skeptical of those claims.

----------------------------

4-Where to go?

This is open ended. I know roughly what I am personally looking for, but if anyone knows good resources for figuring out job demand/cost of living (my needs are very small here), or even how to find these before I arrive, that would be much appreciated.

Right now I think the biggest gap in my knowledge of what to do is between landing and finding an apartment. In the US, renting has always been a several week affair if not longer (between I need an apartment to actually moving in).

I'm a recent grad with an English degree and a TESOL certification-and I'm a native to the good ol' USA to boot.  On top of that, I even already have a bit (albeit only about 2 months from an internship in China) of teaching experience.  

My impression before beginning to apply to jobs was that I'd pretty much be the ideal candidate, as I was more or less led to believe that with my qualifications, I could have any job anywhere that I wanted.  What I've discovered, however, is that a majority of the jobs that I've been looking at that are posted on the various websites, or at least the majority that I'm really interested in, all seem to require at least 1-2 years of EXPERIENCE.  That's capped because it's such a damn naughty word to us recent grads of university in that it represents a real Catch-22.  How do I get that entry-level job that somehow requires experience if I don't already have the experience from an entry-level job? Hope that wasn't too circular, but you get the point..

So I guess what I'm asking is, how big of a deal would it be to stretch my experience a bit to fit the requirements of my employers?  I mean, do they even ever really follow through on the references you provide? It seems to me it would be a bit of a hassle for someone in, say, the Middle East to call someone in China about how long I worked there...
Have you guys had experience dealing with this issue?  
Just to add some perspective, I know for a fact that there are vast numbers of teachers out there who have gotten away with fabricating far more than what I'm thinking of doing---they've purchased fake degrees and fake TEFL/CELTA etc certificates.

I do not currently have a TESOL cert, but would like to get one before going on to graduate school for linguistics or a similar field.

Anyhow, I was hoping that some people may have some more information about this program: whether you've done or are doing it, if the certification is worthwhile (economically or otherwise), and some general visa/working conditions in Thailand.

I'm a student teaching English in France. I've had no TEFL training or teacher's training, although I have lots of experience with kids. It seems like some of my classes need a lot more support than I think they should have at their age/level. They'll do things like interrupt me in the middle of explaining something whining ""I don't understaaaand"" (when it was fully my intention to, first, finish my sentence, and second, demonstrate what I mean), or answer me in French when they know very well how to say it in English, or stare at me blankly when I ask them to repeat (even if I ask them in French, ""répétez ça""). By the end of the class they're often chatting away in French. The 5 year old group I expect this sort of thing from, but I'm getting it from everyone, from 5-12.

Does anyone have advice on getting kids to (ahem) shut up and participate?

(I hope no one is snarky about my lack of experience. I've had tons of experience with tutoring, daycare teaching, music therapy, group home support, summer camps... and I'm starting an M.A. in education next year. this is just a 5h/week job to earn me a bit of extra money while I'm studying abroad.

Also, in addition to buying the one way ticket to Korea, they said I have to buy another ticket to Japan or China (doesn't matter really) that I will cancel when I get there to get my money back. I think this is due to Korea not letting you in on a tourist visa without plans to leave. They said to always say that I am ""on a trip"" to avoid any issues. Later on I will have to do a visa run to Japan which the contract says they will pay for. 

The school seems reputable; I talked to the current american head teacher and she only had good things to say. But the plane ticket situation doesn't feel right to me. Seems kind of shady... does anyone have any insight or have gone through a similar process?

OK. Right. Errrrrr. I'm a little stumped. Obviously the two most important factors here are the effective use of IT in the classroom, and the Japanese factor. Well, having taught in Mexico, my experience with Japanese learners is limited to, basically,zero.

So, /r/TEFLers, two things:

- If anyone with Japanese experience could tell me any key things to look for...much appreciated!

I'm interested in finding out more information about teaching English in a foreign country. 

I was born in the US (and am a citizen). I also hold Irish (therefore EU) citizenship. I only speak English.

In 2010, I graduated from a well-regarded private university in the United States with a degree in Business Administration. I was working in this sector, but the firm I work for is closing and I want to start a new adventure.

I have no degrees in any sort of teaching accreditation, English or otherwise. I used to tutor one of my cousins years ago.


**Will my degree (and being an American citizen) be enough to get a beginners' teaching job? Do I need to obtain some sort of teaching certification before I start applying for jobs?** I've come across numerous websites with English teaching listings posted. I'll explore the links here, since they have been vetted (unlike whatever I stumble on through google).

Also, in May, my girlfriend will be graduating with a Master's degree in English (I believe with TEFL certification) from a prestigious Czech University. She'd like to join me where ever I am to work. **Is there a strong bias by employers against non-anglo citizens?** She also has taught English to Czech people for years (usually 1 on 1) and worked with children, so, despite the country of birth, I feel like her resume is much stronger than mine! She also speaks some Spanish, French and Arabic (and is native/fluent in Czech). 

I've noticed that this subreddit seems Asian-centric. I think we'd like to go to Asia since it's completely new to both of us, but we're open to go anywhere. **Where are places we should not go (other than North Korea)?** Since there'd be two of us, a city would probably be preferable since there's more opportunities for both of us to work in an urban place versus a smaller one. 

**Where would you recommend we go?**


I really appreciate if you took the time to read this. Thank you for any and all advice.

I'm half-Japanese, a recent college grad, and I'm interested in teaching English in Japan as I figure out my life.  I was wondering if people with experience in these opportunities could give me some advice and answer a few questions.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

A few things to note:

- I'm half-Japanese.  I speak Japanese with a fair degree of fluency, but I am far more fluent in English.  I've lived in Japan for years at a time so I'm quite familiar with the culture and customs, and I don't really need much advice regarding food, travel, etiquette, etc.  

- I currently reside in the US.

- I'm a 22yo male, and a recent college graduate with a BA from a 4-year university.

- I don't have an ESL/TEFL license, nor do I have too much formal experience teaching.

- To be frank, I'm mostly interested in this because I miss Japan dearly, but I'm also interested in teaching (adults or children).  This is something I'd like to do as I try to figure out what to do with my life.

So, without further ado:

1. Any general advice on which programs are recommended?  I've been doing some research on the JET program - is it good?  Are there better companies to consider?  Which program provides the best experience and/or pay?  Which treats their employees the best?

2. Is it necessary/advisable to get a TEFL license before applying?  Does it depend on the program?

3. I have both American and Japanese citizenship.  I realize this is strictly forbidden in Japan - would I need to renounce one of my passports in order to apply?

4. Are there any age ranges you'd suggest in particular for a first-time teacher?  Would it be better to teach in a school, or tutor adults?  Is an *eikaiwa* school preferable to a public school?

5. Are there any other subreddits or forums you'd recommend for questions like this?

I've been matched up with a girl from South Korea. They have a lot of resources available, but I figured this would be a good place to discuss my approach.

The most important part of the first lesson will be getting to know her, understand her current English language skills, and find out what she wants to focus on. But I'd very much like to have some material prepared so that we can get into her areas of interest within the first lesson. My plan is to prepare a wide variety of exercises, ranging from basic to advanced, so that once we get to know each other we can do something relevant.

So far, I'm thinking of including the following:

1. basic/introductory conversation - ""Hi, my name is ____"" ""How are you?"" ""I am fine, thank you"" etc. Obviously I'll only do this if she struggles with introductions and conversation when we meet. I will probably skip this, as it seems like it would be insulting to someone who is already an intermediate or advanced English speaker.

2. culture and history of halloween - if she has good conversation skills and is interested in learning new vocabulary and some American culture

3. Verbs with prepositions - the difference between putting on a coat, putting out the dog, putting *down* the dog, putting off your homework, and putting an eggo waffle in the toaster. I found this type of vocabulary to be immensely useful when I was an intermediate German student, so I figure it will work well if she's studied English but not been immersed for very long.


4. Idioms - What does it mean when someone says ""Just give me a ballpark figure"" or ""that's right on the money""? This will be if she is near fluent with literal meanings of words but wants to really immerse herself in Californian/American English and its subtleties.

So that's my current plan. Someone in r/Lingusitics told me not to worry about having lots of exercises prepared and just to focus on learning what she needs. I respected his advice, but frankly I'm doing this to challenge myself and have fun while helping someone, so I don't mind putting a lot of work into the first lesson. Obviously priority number one will be to get to know her and her needs, but I'd like to start right up with some work. Is there anything else I might add to my arsenal to fill in the beginner/intermediate/advanced gaps? And are there any interesting difficulties that Koreans in particular will be likely to have when learning English?

I'll probably be back to report on how this went and get some more advice after the first lesson.

Oxford Seminars?

*Teaching Material:  *
*Handout #1*
*Handout #2*
*Handout #3*

**Type of Students:**  College-aged advanced learners in a University setting.


**Lead-in: **

T:  Don't you all love reading?  I spent the weekend reading Jame Joyce.  Has anyone here read any stories by James Joyce?  Maybe Ulysses or Dubliners? 

T:  I read the short story “The Dead,” which is in Dubliners.   It's the longest story in the collection, but also one of the best stories, as well as one of the most well-known.  Does anyone know where James Joyce is from?

T:  James Joyce is from Ireland.  Can anyone tell me which country is just east of Ireland?

T: Right, the United Kingdom. Can anyone tell us something about Ireland or the United Kingdom? 

T:  While I've never been there, I know that the weather is generally wet and cool.  You would need to dress in layers while there.  What do you wear when it gets cold out?

*Possible ideas (write on the board): *
*Jacket*
*Coat*
*Hat*
*Scarf*
*Gloves*
*Boots*
*Socks*
*Ear Muffs*



T:  Good!  






**Activity 1:**

T: I have a handout here that I would like you all to look at.  

*Hand out handout #1.*

T:  I would like you all to spend a few minutes scanning this passage.  It is an excerpt from James Joyce's “The Dead.”  I would like you pay careful attention to the weather that is mentioned, as well as the different types of clothing mentioned in the passage.

T:  Ok, (Student), can you name one of the items of clothing mentioned in the passage?

S:  Galoshes.

T:  Ok, (Student), can you name a nother item of clothing mentioned in the passage?

S:  Diving suit.

T:  Ok, (Student), can you name another item of clothing mentioned in the passage?

S: Tie.

T:  Great!  Now, can anyone tell me what a diving suit is for?
.... A tie?
....Galoshes?


**Activity 2:**

T:  Ok, now I want you all to take a look at this paragraph.
*Hand out handout #2.*
*--GrandForksHerald.com*
*--Guardian.co.uk*

T:  Ok, read through the first paragraph and tell me what you think the paragraph is about.  Come up with a headline for the paragraph that explains

T:  (Student) what did you come up with?  
*Discuss briefly with class. Continue around the room so everyone can share their headline.*

T:  The headline from the paper is “Grand Forks man sentenced in robbery case.”  Now read the second article and try to come up with a headline that describes the overall topic of the paragraph

T:  (Student) what did you come up with?  
Discuss briefly with class. Continue around the room so everyone can share their headline.

T:  The real headline for the story is “Severe weather warnings extended to cover the whole of Britain by Thursday.”


**Activity 3:**

T: Now, with the holiday's around the corner, I would like us to read something about the holidays coming up. Here is an article from the New York Times.
*Hand out handout #3.*

T: On the first lesson, I would like everyone to fill in the appropriate blank with a word that fits the context. Take a few minutes and work on this.

T: (Student) can you read the first sentence with the words you chose?
Continue having each student read a different sentence.



T:  Ok, now we will go back to the UK and look at a science article from there.  Please fill in the appropriate prepositions, then we will go through and read it.

T: (Student) can you read the first sentence with the words you chose?
Continue having each student read a different sentence.

T:  (Student) which preposition was used most often in the last piece?
S:  To.

T:  Good job!


**Homework:**

T: Good job today, class.  For homework, I would like everyone to bring in an article about weather.  We will discuss what is appropriate (or necessary) to wear when facing different types of weather.

I'm in Northeastern China, I work with ages 2 to 6 as a school manager, or DoS to some. Though DoS is not my title. 


Pearls of wisdom..

Be patient with your students, for some their motivation to learn a 2nd language is all external via their parents. So it can take time to win them over. 


Management in ESL.. bwahahahahahahahah.. more or less non-existent. Most Directors of Studies, Foreign Managers, Assistant Managers, or whatever it is they designate the poor schmuck they have between you and the school upper administration is there to screen the school admins/owners from dealing directly with their freaky foreign staff. 

Your DoS's power really is fairly limited in what he/she can do. 

Always keep your get the fuck out of dodge money intact. Don't go on a bender of booze, blow, and beyotches late one night in Bangkok and wake up with a strange looking tattoo and a negative balance in your bank account. It traps you in a job you may end up completely hating. 

Teaching TEFL is a job. Treat it like one. Don't be showing up wasted, hung over, or looking like a complete douchebag. 

Teaching is something you need to put a huge amount of energy into. Get some sleep the night before you hit the classroom. Eat well, sleep well, take care of yourself properly, and you'll be ok in the end. 

Resources for teachers are plentiful on the internet, but me personally.. I buy books and I hoard them. I will share them, but be prepared to get your balls kicked into the next decade if my supplemental books go AWOL. 

Lots of people say you should get a CELTA or something like that before you go teach. I personally think you should spend time teaching before you go teach as a means of paying your way through the world. 

I suspect if you did both you'd be better off.. do try to get experience teaching in order to develop your presence in front of others. It helps.

Controlling your classroom starts before you enter the room. Be ready to bend the students to your will, but do not break them. They are people just like the rest of us and breaking a person to the extent they are running out of your room crying because of their asshole teacher isn't the best way forward. 
- Create a behavioral management plan.. implement that son of a bitch as soon as you hit the floor. 

Breathe confidence.. exude it from your pores.. look like you know what you are doing even if you don't know.

I'm from Canada and am in HK at the moment on the 90-day 'no-visa-needed' permit. 

I have a family friend here in HK who operates a language centre. She's offered me a full-time teaching position for 4-5 year old's. 

It's more of a babysitting job than teaching to be honest, but the pay is enough to allow me to live in HK which is something I've always wanted and the kids are adorable.

My University degree is not teaching related, and the only teaching experience I have is from all the hours I've accumulated volunteering at her centre. However, she suggested I complete a short/economical TESOL/TEFL program online so she can put that down when applying for my work visa.

So with the job lined up, all I need now is to get this certification asap. I was wondering if reddit knew any legit online places that I can get it done fast? I found a 40-hour online TEFL one that comes with a certificate, but I'm not sure if it's legit or if it's a online scam...

1. A public school seems to be the best deal. I don't really care what I get paid as long as I'm not destitute. The higher likelihood of having housing arranged and a more formal work schedule to me is more important than slightly higher income. Thoughts?

2. I have a degree, but it is in a technical field (nuclear physics). I get the impression that a degree is a plus, but I don't know if that still applies if it is from a field completely unrelated to language or teaching.

3. What sort of attire is the teacher expected to wear? I know Chinese society is much more formal than ours and that they take school very seriously. Will I have to buy suits or something?

4. I am fairly good at learning languages, I try to learn them as a hobby. I can read, speak, and write French and Spanish with decent proficiency and am currently working on Hebrew and Russian. I think I can learn Mandarin or Cantonese with diligent study and immersion, but will a complete lack of knowledge interfere with teaching?

5. I have zero teaching experience, is this a big deal?

6. I'm a 6'4"" white guy with a Chinese last name. Will this get me undue attention? Does such attention become annoying? Friends that have gone to China, Japan, and Korea tell me that they get mobbed and asked for autographs and I don't know if I could deal with that if it happened all the time.

7. If I was in one of the larger cities, would a Western-style toilet be available? I really don't think I could deal with a squatter toilet, especially if the provided accommodations had a dorm-style shared bathroom. I can give up most Western decadence, but this is probably a dealbreaker.

8. I'm basically tone-deaf, and I worry that the tonal nature of Chinese might make it difficult for me to pick out words and learn the language. Is this ever a problem?

Thanks in advance for anyone wishing to enlighten me.

EDIT: One more:

9. I understand some of the basics of Chinese etiquette, but I'm sure I'll end up being boorish by local standards. Things such as accepting business cards with both hands I can do, but other things that I'm sure I'd never think to research and be aware of will certainly come up.

I am currently exploring my options of moving out of my home country. TEFL is one of those options. I have a few questions though:

* Is it possible to secure work in SK or Japan as someone who is not from the US, UK, or Australia?
* Is it possible to work short term contracts; f.e. a few weeks to one month, two months, or three months?

FYI, I am trilingual and I passed a IELTS test two years ago and scored 8.5 on average.

* I have a B.A. from an American University
2. I have been teaching English full-time in South Korea for about 3 years now, but only private schools and elementary schools.
3. I'm willing to do what it takes to do this and put my nose to the grindstone.

So why Japan? Basically, I'm looking for a little bit more cultural depth and a cleaner, more diverse country. South Korea has been good to me, but in my time I've spent in Japan, and with Japanese friends, I've had a better time. I'm not looking to get into U of Tokyo, just any college or university position to get my foot in the door. I have been studying Japanese casually for a few months and have learned a few kanji and the kanas.

I'm passionate about ESL teaching. I want to do research and develop as a teacher. I currently teach adults that are preparing to go on working holidays to other countries and I really enjoy my job, but I'd like to have something a bit more stable, thus my longing for a university gig.

What I'm seeing from researching this for a while is that I'll need a few things.

1. MA in TESOL.
2. Experience and networking in Japan.
3. Publications

As far the M.A. goes, I'm at a bit of an impass. I really want to get one, but I'm still trying to save to pay off my B.A. I know that I need a degree from America or the UK to be considered for most jobs.

Here are the questions:

1. What should I do as far as the M.A. goes? Online or in-person? Does it matter? Any recommendations from those who have done this?
2. Related to the above: I was a fuck-up in college. I graduated with something like a dismal 2.1 GPA because I didn't get serious until my final two years in university, but the damage was done. How will this affect me?
3. Should I try to secure a job in Japan as soon as I can just so that I'm in country and meeting people or networking? I'm worried that the meager 250,000 a month I might find (or even less) plus working 40-50 hours a week (and possibly doing an M.A. TESOL) might drive me to insanity.

I've been trying in recent months to get a teaching job abroad. This past week I had an interview with a member of footprints' recruiting agency.

After talking to people and doing a bit of research TEFL is very appealing to me.  I am currently doing a hybrid of travel, volunteering, and finishing up my degree (I have about a year left), but would like to settle into a city abroad for a while.  My biggest criteria is to work in a bigger city in a country with a decent enough cost of living that I can save at least some tangible amount of money during my stay.  Korea and Russia are looking like my two favorite options, however I don't think Korea will work because the degree is needed for the visa.

I've looked through this subreddit enough to gather the disdain for teaching w/o a degree, but was curious if my military experience would help me in any way with getting a job while I finish school.  I wasn't just a grunt gaining little outside skills, I was a nuclear electrician, and have ~125 credits from that (225 total including current school credits), experience in giving training both to groups and one on one in my field (and other little applicable tidbits relating to military leadership), and am extremely confident in my grasp of and ability to speak/teach the English language well.

My biggest fear is that I do something like a TEFL certification in St. Petersburg and despite what some of the things I've read (been pitched to) there are only jobs in some remote locations or worse no jobs at all due to my lack of degree and I'm stuck and in the hole.

Some things about me:

* Native english speak (from US)
* Currently no Japanese skills, I'd likely take courses this Summer/Fall if we decided to move
* BS in Computer Science, will have MS in Computer Science by the time we move
* I was a TA once for a Winter session class in college

I have just started teaching some grade 1 and grade 3 classes in Thailand. I am currently teaching greetings and farewells. I am looking for some games that do not require a large amount of space as the classrooms are not big but there are quite a few students in each.

However, someday I would like to find work in another country. I know that the Trinity certTESOL is considered to be on the same level of accreditation as the CELTA but I hear that the CELTA has more worldwide recognition. 

Do you think that the Trinity certTESOL's lesser recognition worldwide compared to the CELTA is substantial enough that I should be concerned about it? If the difference is marginal then I will go ahead with the Trinity certTESOL course but if having the CELTA might make a serious difference in the future job hunt in let's say Asia for example then I will gladly go ahead with the CELTA course instead.

Start Date: September 2013

Type of job: Conversational English teacher

Age range: 5-99, but you'll mostly be working with teenagers and adults.

Working hours: around 20 per week, depending on the school's student load. October thru March you'll probably have more hours but the school is flexible and if you want less hours they'll probably accommodate you. Things slow down April-May and you'll probably be working ~10 hours per week. Then you'll get a bunch of hours in June due to summer camps. Travel to another city (likely Salavat) may be necessary for the summer camps; the school will offer you a per diem, accommodation and cover all transport costs.

After June, you will have nothing until next September. So you will either have to budget carefully or return to your country of origin after completion of the school year.

Pay: 350 rubles per academic hour (45 minutes), possibly negotiable based on qualifications and experience.

Required qualifications: The school would prefer a BA and CELTA but they've had very positive experiences with people who don't have substantial qualifications. If you can impress the director with experience, personality, and work ethic they will work with you. Being a native speaker is a must and Americans are preferred. Your ethnicity isn't an issue for the school. A background in Art is also preferable as the school has an ""English thru the Arts"" program that they would like to continue after our departure. A TEFL certificate of some kind is required for the Russian government. Online certificates are acceptable. Knowledge of Russian is not required but it would be helpful for you personally, Ufa is a provincial city and it might be difficult to get around if you don't speak any Russian. Most of the school's non-teaching staff doesn't speak English, as well.

Accommodation: None. The school will help you with locating an apartment. Monthly rent in Ufa ranges from ~8000 rubles for a room rental and ~13000+ rubles for a private studio apartment. Apartments in Russia are almost always furnished so you won't need to worry about that.

Work visa: The school will provide the letter of invitation but you will need to obtain a visa from a Russian consulate. The school will handle the transfer from a temporary work visa to a 1-3 year visa before the temporary visa expires. They will also handle renewing the visa, if necessary.

Contract: The school will start you off with a 6 month contract to see if you are a good fit for them, after that, the duration of the contract is up to you, within legal limits (3 years max).

Additional information: Travel during the school year will be problematic, during national holidays and the summer you are free to travel.

Taxes for foreigners are 30% for the first 183 days of your stay in Russia, but you will receive a tax return following the 183 days. Following this you will pay the standard Russian flat tax of 13%. The school pays the 13% tax so you will receive the full hourly wage after the first 183 days.

Getting your own private students is not officially allowed but the school doesn't mind if you do this. The going rate for private lessons is ~500 rubles per hour.

About the school: It is a private school with a couple of locations throughout the city. The director of the school has great English, is super friendly, and very accommodating. The administration is receptive to what you want to do with the students and any ideas for new classes you may have.

About Ufa: Population ~1,000,000. While it's a fairly provincial city, there's a fair amount of cultural activities, good restaurants and outdoor activities with which to entertain yourself. Cost of living, food, and entertainment is substantially lower than Moscow or St. Petersburg. Regarding safety, I don't have the crime rate statistics but I have never had any problems in Ufa during my 18 months here. Regarding racism, Ufa has always had a high Muslim and Caucasian population and due to this, you're much less likely to encounter racism and xenophobia than in other places in Russia. Regarding weather, the climate is harsher than that of Moscow and St. Petersburg, the highs in June/July can be up to 100 degrees and the lows in January/February regularly get down to -30F. Winter lasts 5-6 months.

If you have any questions please ask in comments or PM me. As a former employee, I'm going to be completely straight with you with regard to the position. If you are interested in the job please send me a description of yourself and your qualifications/experience.

I know plans change, but as of now I feel like I'll want to spend at least 4-5 years country hopping before I come back. But who knows.

That being said, here are my questions:

1) Having a TESOL minor is, in reality, more of a qualification than going through one of those accelerated online TEFL certification courses that have become so popular, but will employers recognize that? Will they see my experience in the ELI and my degree as sufficient qualifications?

2) As far as preference countries go (aside from Japan), I want to teach in Turkey, the Czech Republic, and Indonesia more than any other countries, so would it be possible to land jobs there with an English/TESOL degree and some experience under my belt? Or will the minor in TESOL not be enough?

3) I'm sure a lot of inexperienced people like me prefer those countries, but since you're a veteran, do you know of any surprisingly wonderful countries to teach in? One's that are off-radar yet great countries to spend time teaching English in?

My name is Agnes Szabo and I'm a PhD student at the Centre for Applied Cross-Cultural Research, School of Psychology at Victoria University of Wellington.
 
I would like to invite you to participate in my study that is part of my PhD research.
 
In this research I’m looking at how cultural transition affects people’s identity. When moving to another cultural we have to deal with a lot of challenges in our everyday life. Experiencing and learning new cultures, values and societal norms can be very exciting but at the same time both socially and psychologically demanding. As an immigrant myself I’m also experiencing this process. This is why I find it important to better understand how immigrants cope with difficulties, learn and gain information in a new culture, and most importantly develop their identity during cultural transition.

If you decide to participate in this completely anonymous study, it will take approximately 30 minutes of your time and it will help us to gain a deeper insight into the identity processes of people in multicultural contexts.
 
In addition to your invaluable contribution to cross-cultural research, you will also have the chance to go into a lucky draw for five 100$ Amazon vouchers.

To complete the following survey you must:
 
· have been born outside of the country where you currently live

· have come to the host country when you were at least 16 years old

· be living in the host country no longer than 2 years

· be at least 18 years of age
 
I would greatly appreciate your participation in this study. And please PASS THIS EMAIL ON to the immigrants you know and who might be interested in participating (e.g., partner, family, colleagues, or friends). So even if you don’t qualify yourself for participation, you could still help me out. Anyone can participate who meets the sampling criteria. It doesn’t matter where they are from and where they currently reside. If the person is an immigrant and speaks English, she/he is welcome to participate.
 
To participate in this research, just click on the following link (or copy the link into your browser):

Every single question here is straight-up narcissistic. ""**I** want to teach despite a complete lack of qualifications."" ""**I** want to go to Korea/China/Brazil/Saudi Arabia because Greendale is cutting my hours."" ""**I** need some games because I don't know what Google is.""

You're all basically walking, meat-bag versions of [this Onion article](http://www.theonion.com/articles/my-year-volunteering-as-a-teacher-helped-educate-a,28803/) from last year. Think beyond yourselves, guys. You've never once done that judging by your post histories, so I'll help you:

- When you actually do fly halfway across the world to teach students, those students will be real, living human beings. Some of them will be lazy, but quite a few of them will be whip-smart. They deserve a teacher who knows what they're doing. Is that really you?

- Once you actually are in front of those students, it doesn't matter that you're American or Canadian. Were you impressed by your Spanish teacher in high school being from Spain? No. You were upset that she never got things graded in time (if you were studious) or upset that she had a thick accent and hit you with erasers (if you weren't.) You can't just talk about your hometown and your family and your family dog for one year and expect your students to learn anything. So, what's interesting about you? What are you passionate about? Can you incorporate those things into your lessons?

(If you can't think of anything interesting about you or you struggle to hold a conversation with strangers, *you're going to have a bad time*. Start practicing **now**. Walk up to a total stranger and try to impress them or make them laugh or get their phone number or get them to sign your cast. You're going to spend a lot of time *managing people* as a teacher - start getting good at it.)

- So, you've worked through points 1 and 2. You realize that you need to step your game up and have something (preferably a lot of things) interesting to say in class. What now?

Well, you prepare to fall on your face. Your students will be individuals and they won't react the same way to your shtick or your repertoire each time. They'll be looking at each other lovingly or tired from swim class or upset that dad is away on a business trip to Dongguan again. Hangman being a smash-hit on Monday doesn't mean your kids will want to play it again on Tuesday. You telling your business class about cultural differences between Korea and America on Tuesday doesn't mean they want to return to the topic on Wednesday. What is it they want or need to learn about? What is going to help *them*? In class you're there for them, after all.

Develop some empathy, guys. Nothing will help you more in the classroom than sincere effort towards understanding where your students are, what they want, and how to get them there.

Going to China? Learn the language. Read up on the history. Talk to as many different people and gather as many different viewpoints as possible. When you get conflicting information, you don't write it off as ""China is cuh-razy!"" - you investigate further. You learn nuance.

If that worked out I would then most likely get a CELTA and then would try to find a job in South America. 

I guess my main questions would be around teaching English in SA -- does anyone have any experiences they could share with me? Also how much Spanish would you advise someone to know before they went to a country to teach? I probably only know ""hola"", ""por favour"" and then random ones like ""keso"" hahaha.

Hopefully the fresh spring air is blowing away all the dust in Istanbul, and it's a nice, clear day there.

I'm a poor young man who just happens to be a native English speaker with a CELTA and about a year's worth of experience teaching English to children and adults.

Not in Istanbul yet(at the moment I'm in Bulgaria), but I will be there in ~1 week, and hope to stay there for a month or so. If I like it, I'd like to come back in the autumn.

Of course, the only issue right now is money. I'd be happy to teach some people English, for a low price - 25 TL per hour. The only problem is that I can't find anywhere but Craigslist to put the ads. Could someone point me in the direction of a classified ad directory that is used in Turkey?

1. Do not put anything that isn't English language teaching related on your resume. 

2. Include a photo of yourself. 

So my questions are as follows: first of all, really? *Nothing* unrelated to teaching? I'm luckier than some in that I volunteered teaching English for 3 months in Italy, but other than that and CELTA my resume is completely naked. Unfortunately I am not sure I can swing any of my previous jobs as teaching related. 

And second, I was told by my CELTA instructor not to provide a photo unless they asked for one after submitting my application. But she's been training teachers for a while and not teaching herself so I got the impression schools might not ask right off the bat -- but it seems they are. Does anyone have any advice?

My Questions:  Would it be worth getting a CELTA certification to teach if I am not trying to turn it into a career?  Is the CELTA online course worth doing?  I have a full-job and live over two hours away from the closest physical location (DC), or I would be seriously considering doing the full-time course.  Is it possible to teach in Thailand without a certification and just a science B.S.?

Is there anything an admittedly TEFL-ignorant person should know?

Honest Opinions!,bunchesofgrapes,6,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/18h4au/taught_in_korea_should_i_teach_in_japan_or_the/,"I'll give a short and long version of some background info for those of you with time constraints. Before I start, keep in mind that **money is not important.** I'll make enough to get by. The experience is what counts most to me.

**SHORT VERSION:**

* Taught in Korea for 2 years. 
* Liked some parts but got tired of the ultra nationalism, poor food, xenophobia, ugly/dirty country, messed up education system.
* Have been to Japan 4 times and enjoyed it. Seemed like the country I should've gone to in the first place instead of Korea.
* If I go to Japan, it will be my last country in Asia.
* The Czech Republic is tempting because life will be easier. But, there is no going back to Asia if I go here first.
* I'm considering doing Japan and then the Czech Republic when I'm done but there is a chance I'll get tired of teaching English and will go to grad school in Europe instead.
* Ideally I'd like to do both Japan and the Czech Republic. 
* I want to live in Europe after Asia. I'm worried that if I like Japan and spend a few years there then the market for EFL in the Czech Republic will be diminished and I won't be able to go. When I do go to Europe, I'd like to start off teaching English to make some contacts and settle in before going to grad school somewhere.

**LONG VERSION:**

I taught English in Korea for two years. It was a fascinating experience and I'm glad that I did it, but by the end I was really getting fed up with the ultra-nationalism, xenophobia/racism/condescension, poor food, screwed up education system, and the relatively ugly/dirty country as a whole. It would've helped if the people were more down-to-earth, but they weren't. I travelled to Japan 4 times while I was living in Korea and enjoyed it quite a bit every time I went. It stood out in stark contrast to me coming from Korea; the food was decent, it was much cleaner, the country was a lot more beautiful, people were more polite, it seemed like there were more subcultures and a bit more room for self expression (i.e. different fashion styles, cars were different colors, etc.), people seemed a bit less xenophobic, and things were more orderly in general. Japan seemed like the country I should've gone to in the first place instead of Korea.

That said, I have some reservations about going to Japan. I know that the education system will be more or less the same as Korea. I fear that once I pry beneath the surface I'll find most Japanese to be just as closed off to outsiders as Koreans. 

I've always kept the Czech Republic or Europe in general in mind as my back up plan for once I'm tired of living in Asia. It will be much easier for me to live there. Culturally they are more similar to my own, the standard of English education is much higher, students are willing to participate so I'll get more job satisfaction, and the food is right up my alley. Basically I know that I would have an easier time living there. 

If I go to Japan it would be my last country in Asia. I'm drawn to do it because I don't feel like I'm done with Asia yet and Japan seems like the best fit for me personally. However, I'm worried that I'll go there and find out that it isn't much better than Korea was for me or that it'll burn me out on teaching English. I don't plan on teaching English for the rest of my career. I want to get out of EFL before I'm 30 (I've got 5 more years to go) and possibly go to grad school to help me get started in another field. I've been thinking about going to grad school in Europe for something else (maybe International Relations) once I'm done with teaching English also since I enjoy living abroad and cultural exchange but don't want to be a teacher for the rest of my life. I've always wanted to live in Europe after Asia and going to grad school there would be a nice way to kill 2 birds with one stone once I'm tired of teaching English.

Here are some of the plans I devised in my head. 

Plan #1 - Go to Japan. If I don't like it, leave after one year and teach in the Czech Republic.

Plan #2 - Go to Japan. Like it, teach for a few years, then go to grad school in Europe.

Plan #3 - Go to the Czech Republic. Teach first, then go to grad school in Europe.

Basically, if I skip going to Japan now then I will never have a chance to go again. I'm willing to take that risk if I feel like there is little chance that I'll find Japan to be a better experience than Korea. The Czech Republic is the easy way out. I am somewhat concerned though that if I enjoy Japan and spend a few years there that the market in the Czech Republic will dry up by then. I don't want this to be a situation of having to choose one over the other. I'd like to do both if I can.

How much more expensive is it to live in Shanghai?

What kind of salary should I haggle for with a CELTA and 4 years experience in Korea?

Are Chinese better to work for/work with/teach than Koreans?

Is teaching privates illegal? If it is, is it a law people care about enforcing?

Also, I'm 24 by the way.

Problem is, though, that I really want to go teach english abroad.  I was on my way to doing it for this February (had been getting paperwork ready since back in summer 2012).  But I got randomly major sick and took months to get things under control.  In the process, I had to cancel my plans to go to Korea.

Now, I have that job and start in a couple of months.  However, I'm sort of at a crossroads.  I still desperately want to go to Korea like I originally planned.  I really don't want to wait that long either (I get people say jobs will always be there, but I'm not convinced the benefits will be as good the longer I wait).

I'm considering leaving my job after a year and going to Korea either in August 2014 or February 2015.  I guess if I leave in August 2014, that would equal having the job for 1 year.  If I leave in February 2014, that would equal having the job for just under 2 years.  

I want to go the public school route as well.  Its a big goal of mine, and ultimately I'm not really sure I'm looking to work in the financial sector long term.  But, it's a very well known company and would look really good on my resume in the future if I did decide to do stay in the financial sector.

Would I be making a stupid decision leaving this job after only a year?  Would that hurt my reference?  What about waiting just under 2 years, would that hurt my reference?

This is something I really want to do.  It's very important to me.  I never was able to afford to go abroad in college.  I know also I won't be able to do it later in my life.  I know I need to do it within a couple of years.

My qualifications are decent but my experience is lacking.

Currently I'm working as a translator, which is something I wanted to do for a while, but it's so dull, not to mention poorly paid for the number of hours I work and the constant stress of deadlines. With my choices in life it's inevitable that I will be poorly paid (relative to others with degrees in other subjects), so I may as well enjoy my work if nothing else. I enjoyed teaching, but decided to take time out to try something else.

So, where to go and teach? With an MA I would ideally like a uni job, but I don't have the experience. I don't want to get caught in the hagwon mill in Korea again, as the experience isn't valued by, well, anyone really. It would be nice to go somewhere I could stay a while, build a life and career, move towards the uni goal, maybe be part of an emerging economy rather than a dying one.

I have few personal loyalties; I feel little for the UK, and had no issue with being away for three years previously. Obviously, I'm an EU citizen so Europe would be easy in terms of visas, plus I can speak French and Italian, plus some Spanish and German. Money isn't an issue really, though it would be nice to be comfortable.

I worry though about this.  Will there still be descent English teaching jobs over there in two years from now (especially in the public schools via EPIK)?

2. On that note, would it be beneficial to me to at some point in time work on getting a CELTA or some other TEFL/TESOL cert? Does it mean anything at all to have, say, both an MA TESOL and a CELTA? Or would that just be over-qualification and a money-sink?

I need advice so whaddya do?

I've been out of South Korea for about 6 years now. I've spent the last five teaching for the same company in China. I have a heap of experience in ESL and I currently manage the school I work at.

I want to move back to Korea for three primary reasons.

1) Money, I can get more of it there without having to teach a massive amount of private lessons. 

2) I want to go back to university and complete some certificate courses in an online program, which means I need a job that pays /decently/ and offers time enough to keep on top of my studies.

3) I have several friends in Korea I'd like to touch bases with and possibly defile.. I mean hang out with. Which is why I'm picking Korea over other countries like the Middle East. 

I'm not looking for big bucks, I'm looking for that delicate balance between money and hours. I don't need to make a fortune, but I do need to keep my hours down to about 25 to 30 a week. 

I'd prefer to not have that all in teaching, but I've been there and done that and have the t-shirt to prove it.

My concerns:

How cornholed in the Korea job market? I want to be in Seoul or Busan about as much I want to be administered an enema with no lube.

I have learned a lot about TEFL in general and in SK from reading some threads on here and would like to say thanks so far! I just graduated with a degree in Spanish and a certificate in Interpreters' Studies (my plan is to start in Korea, get experience and apply to Spain, maybe Argentina, Costa Rica or Chile, so if you know anything about those locations as well, please feel free to chime in!)I have a couple questions of my own and would love to hear from someone who has experienced TEFL life in South Korea and other parts of the globe

1) Costs. What would be a wise amount of money to bring for start up costs? Such as housing (do you have to put money down, deposit, security, etc.), transportation, plane ticket, other living expenses. What would you say would be a bare minimum, an average amount, and ""more than enough""? I'm currently doing full time temp work to afford the TEFL classes, how much more would I need?

2) Background check. I had an arrest for possession of marijuana but the charges were dismissed and the case was dropped. Will this affect my eligibility/show up on the background tests that are used?

3) Recruiters. I have read that recruiters are the way to go, especially if you wok during the day. True? False? Any recruiters that come highly recommended or the opposite?

4) Areas of Korea. Ideally, I would like to live somewhere where rent is affordable/low with public transportation so I wouldn't have to purchase a vehicle or bike (although I'll probably get a bike anyway, can't hurt right?)

I know you must get a ton of these, but a close friend of mine and I are currently working on applying for the JET program this year, and we had a few questions.

The big one I'm asking on behalf of my friend. He is in a bit of a unique position, in that he is Female-to-Male transsexual. The two questions that arise for us are: 

A) Is this going to be a problem, since he will need to declare it on the medical form (he is taking Testosterone)? 

B) Is he going to have a problem with the fact that all his legal paperwork has been shifted to denote male, *except* for his birth certificate, which still says female? (He's working on getting this changed, but he was technically born in Texas, and they're not exactly giving him an easy time of it. We're in Maine now, and the state has been nothing but helpful for everything else, but we're likely going to need a court order to force Texas to change it).

Other, more benign questions:

We realize that the odds of getting placed together are slim. Would it hurt our applications to put down that we're applying with each other anyway? Is there anything we can do to up our chances of being placed in the same area? (Not necessarily in the same schools, but in a close enough proximity that we can room together)

What sorts of things should we expect for the interview? And what dress is appropriate? My first thought is full suit and tie, but I've read a few posts here and over on /r/japan talking about how it's good to be a little more relaxed. Are (well-groomed) beards frowned upon?

I know GPA is weighed fairly strongly, what would be the bare minimum? (I think I'm alright in the realm, since I'm just under 3 with a ton of other side things, but my friend I believe is lower).

1345233103.0,4,self.TEFL,ye613,"Newbie English teacher, should i keep looking for other offers?",stevyjohny,6,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/ye613/newbie_english_teacher_should_i_keep_looking_for/,"So basically, I am nearly jobless right now. I could go into huge detail, but the only thing that matters is I currently have two jobs but almost no hours. Again, if you are curious enough as to why this is, you can ask but the main thing is not enough work and future looking dim.

It was this problem that led me into looking for jobs over in South Korea. I got a hold of a recruiter by accident and he brought me up to speed on the process for getting over there. I was actually asked to go to Korea once before after I graduated in 2010. I regret not doing that now because I wonder where I could be at this time had I done that. However, I really didn't know anything about teaching over there and he asked me if i could go in a months time. I didn't get a good vibe, although it was probably just shoddy research on my part.

Now, I started looking again around early July wondering what to do with myself. After talking to the recruiter, I learned all about how you need an FBI background check now among other things and all the changes that have taken place in the last couple years. He said it would be too late for public school but hagwons are hiring all the time. So i just said what the heck and started to get working on my papers.

 I submitted my FBI check in mid july. Since then I have an offer to go teach for 2 million won per month. They sent me a contract two hours after interview. The interview was really short. I heard this was not uncommon. I'm surprised I even got one so fast. The recruiter said that schools are not talking to people unless they have all their documents first. This school happened to have a huge need for November and that is enough time for me to get all my stuff. So it happens to work out nicely.

Anyways, I have read from others on these forums that you should keep interviewing and compare offers. How do you do that since they offer contracts so fast? From what I have read, the best I could do for having no experience would be maybe 2.2 million won. What sort of things should you look for in an offer? They gave me the general spread:paying for my flight over there, severance, paying for apartment etc. What kind of incentives would another school offer? I also hear that public school is the best. Again, having no experience, I'm not sure how much better I can actually get and that is ok if that is the case.

It is a little nerve racking, but the recruiter has been helpful. And it seems like a great way to live a low cost lifestyle and also since I have nothing going on for me right now in the states. Also, has anyone's teaching experience ever translated back home or is Korea just viewed as the place where college graduates go to screw around and chase women?

TL:DR - Got an offer for teaching English in Korea, but wondering if I should still keep applying for other schools because of possible perks that other schools/recruiters may or may not offer.

",johnnyliteral,5,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/vq3lf/seriously_new_to_this_but_serious_however_there/,"Hi, r/TEFL. I apologize if the following post is a bit long. I just have some of the typical questions that pop up on this forum every once in a while, and a few more complicated issues that I am wondering about. 

I recently (less than a month ago) graduated from college with a B.A. in English. I've always planned on teaching - I love the language arts, and I especially love working with people - but I was always told that the best course of action in terms of finding a job where I live was to specialize in one degree area and go on to receive certification afterward. I am currently at that crossroad, but I am wondering if I should do something else. Something outside the box! 

The prospect of teaching abroad seems almost *too* good to be true. There are organizations in my area looking for people to teach in Asia, and to me, a student who never had the time, money or opportunity to study abroad, it only seems like a win-win situation. That being said, I haven't applied anywhere and I don't *really* know how good a shot I have at getting hired. I've prowled this subreddit for some time and have looked into getting a CELTA certification, but at the moment I'm a bit strapped on cash (more on that later). From my perspective, eventually getting certified seems worth it. However, the jobs I've seen do not require any certification other than a Bachelor's degree. Is this a red flag? 

I don't want to look at this as some sort of r/IWantOut fantasy. I do want out, but I've gotta make it clear that I've never *been* out. The money makes it enticing (the jobs offers I've seen posted on Craigslist would nearly pay off my student loans in a year) and I've lived alone for lengths of time before, though nothing comparable to somewhere outside of America, and nothing comparable to a year. I don't feel like I would have a horribly difficult time acclimating to a new society. I realize that sounds naive coming from a 22 year old, but I know people do it. Teaching is what I want to do as a career, so I'm willing to do what I can to make it as interesting and new of an experience as possible. But in your honest opinion, would it be unwise to take a job in a foreign country I've never been to, doing a job I've never done before (I have some tutoring experience), even if it's something I plan on turning into a career eventually, whether it's stateside or elsewhere? 

Now for the complicated part. 

I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease back in high school, and while normally my illness is under control, I have to keep myself on point in order to make sure I don't relapse.  I've been put on new medication - one that is self administered via shot, once a week. It requires home delivery and refrigeration. I know this is kind of an oddly specific question, but is it even feasible to maintain these sort of health necessities while working abroad? So long as it is shipped cold, the medication lasts. But say I wound in in Korea, or Japan - is it even possible to have something like medication sent overseas? Will I run into any sort of customs problems? My doctors said that there shouldn't be an issue shipping it, but I think I would feel more comfortable if I knew about anyone else's experience with shipping stuff like this overseas. 

Now all of that information above is what I meant by I'm a bit ""strapped for cash"". Had a couple of crazy medical things go on over the past few months. I'm getting back to full health, but it took a toll on my family's budget. Is there any source I could look at to figure out just how much I should put into this? How much money I should save up before I even consider going anywhere? I don't think I'll be getting on an airplane next week, but if there's anything I should look at I'd be more than willing to do the research. 

Phew, that was a long post. I'm so sorry if that was a tedious read. I'm just anxious about a lot of this, but mostly excited. I might be overthinking it, but it all seems too fun to be true. Both my family and I agree that I would do well in a country like Korea or Japan, where the pay is good enough and there's an established English teaching base.

I have been looking at becoming a English Teacher overseas for the past three years now, and have at this point become dead-set on making it a life long career, or at the least, long term.

With a general goal in front, I've come at a crossroads as to what to do next. The University Extension offers two types of English Teaching certificates, a short term, one month intensive TEFL certificate; and a much more comprehensive, one year, 28 unit TESOL Certificate, complete with a student teaching program where you get ten hours (One hour a week for a quarter) to teach a class of actual exchange students here in California to study English.

I have been volunteering at said Extension center - which is comprised mostly for Exchange students studying English - as an English conversation teacher for over two years, and have had experience teaching at a volunteer camp in France and through a self-initiated program in South Korea.

Considering my goal is to get a permanent position teaching in either Korea or Japan (preferably at a University),  would you advise just going for the short TEFL, or will a one year TESOL make that much more a difference? Would this, coupled with experience, be enough, or is a MA necessary?

Beyond this, any career advice you can give to me? If more info is needed, I can provide.

He speaks Chinese fairly fluently and his Chinese improved dramatically as he enjoyed his time teaching, drinking, and partying as an American bachelor in China.

I have not gotten qualified to teach English as a foreign language yet. I'm about to decide on a TEFL certification class online to knock out the class asap (only work 3 days this week, could technically knock it all out this coming week).

I had promising interviews but have been feeling quite discouraged after nearly four months of this. I'm apt on sending out another few waves of resumes and cover letters but after that I know I'm going to be done with it all; I do not want to waste anymore time feeling crappy when I could be focusing on going back to school for more training or doing my TEFL/TESOL certificates. So I'm again considering teaching abroad in Hong Kong (where I hold citizenship and where I have family) or Korea so I can work, travel and explore.

So I did a bit of research and there seems to be a lot of different companies that are recruiting. Aclipse came up on my search first for Korea and they are linked to the Chung Dahm Institute which appears to be very keen on hiring grads from my alumni since they also have a sister school where it is situated in Canada. They sound very promising (help you settle in the country, etc) and the process for hiring Canadians (I'm currently in the United States and hold permanent resident status here) sounds much friendlier than for hiring an American although I could be mistaken. So I have some questions:

1. If I'm doing the TEFL certification, would it also be advised that I do a TESOL training programme? I've never heard of the TEFL until I was on the Aclipse website but have been more acquainted with the TESOL (and their website looks less ghetto TBH).

2. What are the standard guidelines for retention in these positions? How long do people usually stay? 

3. If anyone is willing to disclose, how much can I expect to be making? It'd be really nice to have a real life answer from someone who has taught in a foreign country. I mean, I don't expect to be ballin out of my pockets but I do hear you make a somewhat good salary. 

4. Are South Koreans friendly folks?! Receptive to a non-Caucasian, fellow Asian but non-Korean?! Hey, I'm also Canadian so will that not also grant me some sort of diplomatic status?!

5. What age groups do they usually place you with?

6. Just how rural is rural in Korea? What are some good mid-sized areas to be looking at? How unrealistic is teaching in Seoul? 

7. If anyone has any experience teaching English in Hong Kong, It'd be great to hear it! What districts did you teach in, the hiring process, certifications, salaries, life as an expat, etc. Anyone permanently settle there afterwards?

8. I just bought a dog who is now just shy of 3 months and can't bear the thought of being completely absent for a year or two in her early years but may very well have to be. Pets in Korea: Impossible? Research shows it is. Any insight? 

9. I saw some posts about people settling in Korea so I know it's not impossible but just how likely is that to happen, really?

10. What the beans did you do after you came back from teaching abroad? I've heard many things and honestly not all that promising...

I am currently finishing my AA (will be done over the Summer) and I am looking at switching Majors as I move onto get my Bachelor's since I do not like the path I am on (IT, specifically Windows Administrative work).

Until recently I didn't know much about TESL/TEFL but as I looked more into it I found something I thought I would really enjoy in both the teaching aspect and the opportunity to live abroad. However there is a lot of conflicting information out there and a lot of bad sources so I thought some first hand replies would be a good way to get some answers.

1. What (typically) is needed to teach abroad? I know some countries want a BA, some just want you to be a native speaker but what are the COMMON requirements?

2. How difficult is it to get a meaningful job in this field? Basically this means enough money to live (doesn't need to be lavishly by any means) and maybe have some job security.

3. Are most positions only available in more rural areas or is it a more even mix between rural and city opportunities? I am a city person and wouldn't be comfortable without many modern conveniences.

4. What, in your experience, does this career actually entail as far as work? I know that is probably a BROAD spectrum but I'd just like to hear some examples.

5. What are some good, practical tips for someone who wants to get into this field, basically words of wisdom?

Lastly, I am aware of the JET Program and I am also aware it is very competitive. Are there, and if so how many, similar programs to JET? I ask because it seems structured as a good way to ease into this type of teaching rather than just going out with no experience etc.

** I'm finishing school and will have a BA.  
* My partner only has a highschool diploma.  
* * We have traveled together before and enjoyed ourselves immensely. 
  
We would love to teach and travel overseas, but don't want to take advantage of the market. White, native English speaker = job, is great but it feels wrong to accept if we can't actually teach. Hence the TESOL search. 

First of, how possible is it that we can find a placement together with our difference in education? Would we have the same contract, or would we be doing the same job for different remuneration?

For the certification, Global TESOL College seems like it has a good [program](http://www.globaltesol.com/package/allpackages#course8) (120 hours - 60 in class + 60 online specialization), and guarantees a job after completion.  Has anyone gone taken the TESOL course from Global TESOL?

I've always been dissuaded from teaching abroad by contracts that run for long portions of time like 2 years. From my understanding, most people find it disappointing, many even leave contracts early. However, I recently found out that you can go abroad and only teach for a summer. Usually airfare isn't included but meals/accommodation seem to be and most places offer weekly pay.

This seems like it might be ideal. Even if I don't enjoy the work that much, I'm only stuck for 3 or 4 months. Furthermore, even though I'm paying my own transportation, because I get the weekly salary and accommodation covered, I should at least be able to break even.

Thoughts? Has anyone done this before and had it go well?

I'm 21, just graduated from university and have applied for two programmes this year. These being the JET Programme and British Council Language Assistant (location China), I know competition for places on both programmes is fierce, so I have decided that if I am unsuccessful I will pursue a CELTA qualification, so at least I will be a little prepared for teaching and can contribute more.

My question is do I take the CELTA qualification in England? or abroad? The benefits of doing it in England is that English is the teacher's primary language and I can concentrate on the work (not treating it as a holiday). But the benefits of doing it abroad is that I am able to create contacts(either with the students who are also on the course, with the course teachers, or by visiting schools out there) and learning in the environment I am to teach in, are there any other points I have missed? 

Price is another factor £1,225.00 (course fee) + £108.00 (Cambridge ESOL validation fee) in England, compared to £989.916 (deposit + final payment including individual accommodation) abroad (TEFL International China, Hangzhou, Shanghai) not including flight fees, which to China might cost around £500-£700. I don't know if I can justify these fees coming from a low income background and not currently having a job. Do you guys know of any other schools or universities offering CELTA courses in China or Japan? or could you perhaps recommend one?

Another idea I was thinking about was getting a teaching job in China/Japan with just my BSc then save up for a CELTA that way, what are your thoughts on that?

Sorry for the long wall of text, any advise would be much appreciated and welcomed (I need all I can get at the moment), also do you guys know of any resources that I can use to increase my knowledge of the English language? (grammar, spelling and increasing one's vocabulary)  as well as teaching methodologies?

I have a question regarding the rigor of the background check process for EPIK. I was charged with shoplifting in my sophomore year of college, but I was never convicted (did a diversion course). I haven't gotten the actual arrest record expunged, though I can. My question is, even if that arrest did show up, would the fact that I wasn't convicted be enough to show that I'm not a criminal? The charge was BS in the first place, but that's irrelevant I suppose. 

Any information from current EPIK folk who might have had a less-than-spotless past would be enormously helpful.

I apologize for the fact that this post pretty much resembles every other post here, but I didn't find anything that really answers my question: 

I am thinking of moving to latin america to learn spanish, relatively short term (I'm willing to stay up to a year, but not more probably, although who knows what will happen when I get there).  Teaching is not my field, I studied development (working for agricultural and political ngos, on immigration issues).  

Anways i""m a recent grad, and I've been unemployed for a few months now, and I am dead broke besides a small portion of inherited money that is enough to cover the cost of a tefl program that includes ""job placement services"" in latin america.   I'm willing to pay if it means that I will actually be guaranteed a payed position and won't have to worry (too much) about money while I'm there.  I'm pretty much open to ANY COUNTRY.   Looking mostly at ecuador for now though. 

Anyways I have no clue if these job placement things are for real.  I am already an expat--I've lived in france for 6 years -- and let me tell you, I've always had a student visa and getting a work visa is like, this unimaginable, amazing holy grail for anybody  at an entry level.   It's really hard and they get rejected all the time.  So I'm thinking...is it possible that If I just pay 1000 dollars, I can not only get TEFL certified, but also get a guaranteed job?

I'm just curious about these things...my main questions are :

a.  has anybody who is teaching in latin america used a placement service or become certified there, and is it too good to be true/ a scam?

b.  does having tefl/tesol certification ACTUALLY HELP or am I better off just finding under the table teaching work on a tourist visa?

c. Is it possible to use random job posting websites to find stuff, like, can that work, or is it worth it to pay for a placement service

Thank you so much...I hope I get tons of feedback, I'm like, quivering with excitement about this next step.
