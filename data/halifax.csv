Velkyr decided to hand over the subreddit to me after an agreement.

I'm not here to impose any form of rules as I have been very hands off and I'm only here to moderate. 

I understand that couple of alternative subreddits have popped up and it has been active in the past day.

I'm not here to discuss what [has happened](http://www.reddit.com/r/M_Y_A_C_C_O_U_N_T/comments/14gx6d/factual_representation_of_events_surrounding/) as many of you already know, but I would rather discuss what we should do as of this day forward.

As I have previously said me and dev0kan were not responsible for what had happened and we were not in the know about it until we had received private messages from the users.

I would like everyone's input as this is not my subreddit and it's your subreddit, the community dictates what we should do.

Would you guys like to keep this subreddit or would you guys like to move on to another subreddit?

Please advise,

Sassan

**UpdateII:** Everyone is unbanned except velkyr. 

**Update III:** Keeping things transparent here is the [screenshot](http://imgur.com/Dk4gQ) of his ""agreement"" since you guys have asked for it. I had asked him for screenshot of the other person that should remain banned and he sent me [this](http://i.imgur.com/BWp7w.png).

**Update IV:** Waiting for a reply from Mostly_Invisible_Man on his thoughts, if he agrees to be a moderator on /r/halifax I'm all for it. I'm also going to add someone that can help us out with CSS of the subreddit.

I thought it was a spectacularly human moment from a politician, and I was impressed enough with his candor that I fired off an email to him to say so. That was several days ago now and I'd forgotten about it.

Surprisingly enough Peter Stoffer just called me in person a little while ago to say thank you for the kind words. I didn't even include my phone number in the email but he took the time to track me down and call anyway (I signed the email with my full name).

I am as apolitical as they get, but good on Mr. Stoffer for being a stand up human being. He's a decent fellow with his head screwed on straight. It's not often you can say that about anyone in politics.

Halifax is a great city sometimes
but it's crimes like these, the ones that hurt people who are already struggling, that make this place hard to live in.

1335114608.0,64,self.halifax,smstz,Hey! Halifax Redditors! Let's cashmob Phat's Barber Shop on April 27th.,monofonik,74,10,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/smstz/hey_halifax_redditors_lets_cashmob_phats_barber/,"As many of us know, Phat's Barber Shop is in pretty dire straights as of late. For those who don't know, you can read this: http://www.thecoast.ca/RealityBites/archives/2012/04/19/barber-phat-luong-repeatedly-victimized

I say we forego the convention of hiding the recipient of a cashmob until the last minute and we all go get some haircuts, and pay him $20  for them, which I'm pretty sure is above his standard going rate.

I'm DEFINITELY doing it this Friday, if anyone would like to organize with me that'd be great.

EDIT: Alright, so people are onboard! That's awesome. Here's what I'm thinking:

1. A huge lineup of us could suck, because it could deter other people who just want a haircut from going to him.

2. He's open like, all day Friday. 9:30am to 7pm.

3. A friend told me recently that in order to do a proper boycott of a business, you need to go into the business, tell them that you're not into their practices and that you are thus boycotting them. I suggest we do the opposite with Phat. When you go in, just tell him you're part of a group of people that think it totally sucks what happened to him, and that we've organized to give him a slight boost in business that day.

So let's just show up at our leisure, and let him know why we're there.

If anyone has any other ideas, I'm totally ears.

EDIT2: I made a Facebook event. You can look at it HERE: http://www.facebook.com/events/293356620744545/

EDIT3: PHAT HAS MADE IT CLEAR that he will not accept money if he doesn't give a haircut. he doesn't want to be a charity case.

also, i will be on cbc radio tomorrow around 8 to discuss this event.",,False,self,t5_2r77k,True,,,True,t3_smstz,http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/smstz/hey_halifax_redditors_lets_cashmob_phats_barber/,

I wanted to post this here just to shed some light on a school that I personally have experience with, and many other people do as well.

I did not write this article, but I find it rings true in every aspect.

If you've had a good experience there, then lucky you! But 99% of people that I know who've attended that school have had a bad time there, for many of the reasons listed below.

So, check this article out if you're interested: http://pastebin.com/XLxAxMFx

Pastebin seems to be overloaded, here it is elsewhere: http://privatepaste.com/34cb803d58

**Edit: I just wanted to say thanks to everyone reaching out with their experiences :) I really appreciate it. I know if I had seen something like this about a school I was interested in, I would definitely put a little more research into it, so hopefully we're helping someone out there.

Edit Edit: I sent a few messages out to some people asking them to share their experiences that they had there, If I didn't contact you, and you would like to share please do! It can be anonymous, or you can give me details, up to you.

Hilarious.

In case the ad gets deleted.

&gt;You may have read in the news that Lululemon is recalling thousands of their signature Yoga Pants in what has become a media frenzy over the pants being “too sheer”.
&gt;
&gt;In a public statement, CEO Christine Day said the only way to tell if your pants are see through is to “put them on, bend over, and look” 
&gt;
&gt;I am all about solving problems. 
&gt;
&gt;I am offering this service FREE OF CHARGE. 
&gt;
&gt;If you put on your Yoga pants, bend over, take a picture and send it to me, I will let you know if they are see through. Yes, I know this is a big job I am undertaking. I am willing to look at as many photos as it takes to help. Why take your pants back if I can let you know if they are see-though or not? 
&gt;
&gt;All you need to do is put the pants on, bend over, and send me the picture. 
&gt;
&gt;I will reply with one of 3 replies:
&gt;• Good
&gt;• Questionable
&gt;• Take ‘em back!
&gt;
&gt;I am doing this through the kindness of my heart.
&gt;
&gt;I’m here to help
&gt;
&gt;If you don’t have a camera, let me know, and I can come over and check in person. Please include your full address and your preference of Red or White wine.

From /u/discowalrus:
&gt;You may want to include Superstore's Italian Cheese promotion in your list. This coming Saturday the 23rd and next Sat. the 30th each superstore is 'cracking' large wheels of aged parmigano reggiano and selling chunks for 25% off. 22 months old on the 23rd and 36 months old on the 30th.
A rare opportunity to buy a lot of the king of all cheeses at a great price, folks. This is the best sale at the moment.

However, what I will do is this: I will thank everyone in [/r/Halifax](/r/Halifax) for being rational, and not jumping the gun.

Since this happened, there has been alot of anger, people accusing this of being a hate crime (There are arguments for/against this), and people jumping the gun.

I have seen, and promptly removed, people on my facebook people I considered friends, attack those with mental illness because of what happened. I even had more than one person even claim that everyone with a psychotic illness be locked up. I have seen alot of hate levelled at the mental health community lately, from those with mental illnesses, to those that work with them.

I have made it no secret that I am part of that community of people. I too have a psychotic illness (Currently labelled as N.O.S, which is typically a placeholder). Most of the people I hang around with have a psychotic illness. Illnesses that range from ""annoying"" to life altering. I have been friends with these people on their meds, and off their meds. I have been with friends before they opened up to people about their illness, and I know those who are proud to be part of this community, and help those not feel ashamed. I have seen them normal, and I have seen them manic. I have been all of these things at one point as well.

That being said, it's obvious that I am disheartened that some Haligonians have stooped to attacking those who are afflicted by something they cannot control. Something that is a part of them, and a part of everyday life.

To me, it's no different than an attack on a member of the LGBT community for being who they are. Only we have progressed greatly in our tolerance for that group. We haven't so much for others.

So, I have read comments on most news stories, personal blogs, and facebook statuses. And I was sad. Then, I read the comments on reddit. From reading comments that range from ignorant to ""hate speech"" (Actually, hate speech laws apparently don't cover mental illness...), I started reading comments where people were actually informed, and actually tolerate us, and judge us on a personal level.

To say I have conflicting emotions right now is an understatement.

Comments like the following have quite literally brought me to tears.

&gt; [The various media responses lead me to believe that this tragedy will result in people with mental illnesses being further marginalized and ostracized. This even is bad for everyone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/shn4n/rip_raymond_taavel_a_life_lost_left_with_only_a/c4e4b6b)

(If you agree with this, please upvote him.)

It's hard writing this up and not getting a little sad. But I think that you guys deserve a shout out for being awesome people in general.

I don't think I have ever been so proud to not only be a part of a community, but also being able to help moderate it.

One last point I want to bring up: Whatever your opinion is on the matter, be it that we should all be locked up, or that you understand we aren't all violant, don't be afraid to post it. Just because I disagree with your views, does not mean any of the mods here will remove it (Unless you are personally attacking someone). [/r/Halifax](/r/Halifax) mods will not remove your comments, no matter how much we dislike them.

I think that if Raymond was still alive, and could see all the hatred being expressed... He would be saddened. He was an activist for his community, and I'm sure he was on the receiving end of discrimination more times than he could remember. I doubt he would want the same for any group of people at all.

Regardless of what you think of me personally, don't judge an entire community on the actions of a few. You judged me on a personal level, and that is your right. But don't judge others based on what either this guy or myself have done. Neither of us represents the community as a whole.

Once again, thank you all.

edit: I will point out one thing: There needs to be a large scale reform of our mental health system in Nova Scotia. At best, it's inadequate. At worse, I would call it negligent and uncaring. Unfortunatly, I don't see the mental health community as united as those in the LBGT group, most likely because it's hard coming out to the public about it. There should be anger at the mental health system, not the mental health sufferers.

Also, if you know anyone who suffers from a mental illness, from depression to psychosis, to anything mental health related, and they are under 30, I suggest you bring up [Laing House](http://www.lainghouse.org) as a place for support. It is a safe place for those with mental illnesses to go to get peer support, speak with staff there, get a meal (Many live in the street, or are on social services due to their illness, and need a good meal), bring home food from the food bank daily, but most importantly, it's a place where they can discuss their illness with other like-minded people, where they won't be judged because of it. Everyone is welcome. If they are over 30, there are other resources they can use, such as the place right next to laing house called connections.

If you care enough, offer to volunteer at either of them. If you suffer from a mental illness, and don't want to tell anyone, go to one of them.

Alright Halifax, here's the main dump of information I'll be able to provide about this storm before it hits. This information is as current as it gets using the most updated model runs and the most current radiosonde data. I will be using the GFS maps as I find this to be the most reliable model.

As you all know, this big ole nor'easter (a type of mid latitude cyclone that impacts the US East coast and Canadian Atlantic) with the potential to set records here and there, but models are having a hell of a time with it. When you hear about the crazy + snowfalls, you are hearing about the NAM model output that's been consistently twice as high as the GFS and ECMWF models. I can't speak about the GGEM (Canadian) or RAP as I don't have detailed access to one and the other is a short range model. Anyway, here is a basic overview of what's going on in detail that's likely being left out by the meteorologists on TV/websites.

Take a look at the [surface at 15Z (11AM)](http://www.twisterdata.com/data/models/gfs/3/maps/2013/02/08/06/GFS_3_2013020806_F09_TMPF_2_M_ABOVE_GROUND.png). What you see down by Virginia coast is a strengthening nor'easter. At the moment it's nothing special, but it's going to see significant intensification. Also note the low pressure near the Great Lakes. This is a system that developed over me (I'm in Iowa) two nights ago and dumped a lot of rain (and now everything is ice, hooray) and is now headed in your direction. This low is bringing very cold Canadian air down into the US. This is important.

Looking at the [dew points at 850mb](http://www.twisterdata.com/data/models/gfs/3/maps/2013/02/08/06/GFS_3_2013020806_F09_DPTC_850_MB.png) you can see a lot of moisture being pulled North from the Gulf. Without going into too much detail, just consider the colors very moist and saturated air for now, because it is (in this case) and it's bringing the water to create the snow. It's going to steadily move its way up the coast line towards you.

[This](http://www.twisterdata.com/data/models/gfs/3/maps/2013/02/08/06/GFS_3_2013020806_F09_RELV_500_MB.png) is the 500mb (halfway up the troposphere, about 5400m) relative vorticity (vorticity = horizontal spin). See that big red area over the Great Lakes? Yeah that's headed directly East. In the simplest terms, high (red) vorticity is indicating a LOT of upward motion (which leads to stronger storms/higher precipitation rates). Guess what it's going to collide with.

Yup. The building nor'easter. This is what's causing the intense snowfall forecasts. So let's review the four things going on here.

* Strengthening cyclone moving up along the coast bringing warm air
* Cyclong moving East from Iowa bringing very cold air
* Lot's of moisture being pulled up from the coast
* Intense region of vorticity moving East towards the coast

All of that is going to collide and cause the cyclone to bomb out (intensify rapidly) to the Southeast of Massachusetts around midnight-3am tonight. The collision of two very different types of lows will result in a messy nor'easter that is supplied by warm, moist air from the south, and very cold air from the north, helping tightening temperature gradients and aid in its intensification.

The NAM is interpreting this as a huge event, upwards of  for the central portion of NS, and around 40- for Halifax. The GFS and ECMWF are still maintaining an estimate of  for central NS and 30- near Halifax. The GFS has increased its estimate since the previous two days worth of model runs, but it's not quick as extreme.

That's a pretty straight forward, quick and dirty analysis of what is going on with this event. Those four things above are big players in what's making this unique. The collision of the two lows is probably what you're going to want to take away here. Feel free to ask questions, I'll be pretty available today and tomorrow, and I'll be making all updates to this thread. Once the RAP model comes in range, I'll start adding that to the discussion.

**EDIT: 1:30pm**
The 12Z data came in awhile ago. This is my first chance to put together an update. Long story short, 12Z runs are called ""off hour"" because they use the same upper atmospheric data as the 6Z run. This means the model typically shows similar results. And all of them did. Same snowfall totals. But, there is other stuff I can talk about.

[Here](http://prntscr.com/s05c1) is the 1pm visible satellite image over Virginia and friends. I've drawn in the general wind flow pattern with their associate temperatures and magnitude of flow (color and thickness of lines), as well as the low pressure centers and their motion (in green). The other low is difficult to identify through visible satellite but it is approximately over Buffalo according to surface plots from the last hour. As mentioned earlier, a strong region of vorticity is associated with this low and it is still headed East on a collision course.

The temperature gradients on this are what is also going to make forecasting precipitation a monster. The subzero air is coming along with the thick blue arrows I drew, everything southeast of that is above freezing at the moment. How this cold air interacts with the Appalachian mountains and the nor'easter will determine your guys' precipitation. There is a possibility that you see less snow and more of a wintery mix, especially since you live right on the coast. You're in for potentially a lot of ""bullshit weather"" as my Haligonian friend describes it.

**EDIT: 10pm**
I apologize for a later than planned update. Life occurred, time was unexpectedly taken up. The storm is on the horizon! The NAM and GFS are continuing to stand by their opinion of the snowfall and it has not changed. The ECMWF is also leaning towards the GFS. It suggests maybe closer to 30cm or less. Of the three, it is being the nicest to you all. [Here](http://weather.rap.ucar.edu/satellite/g13.2013040.0115_US_ir.jpg) is the latest satellite infrared image. The colors relate to cloud top temperature. Colder (bluer) = higher. The cyclone is very clearly in a mature stage right now. It's a shame it isn't day time, this would make for a spectacular visible image from the satellite. 

A great way to know whats going on in the past hour is to check out surface plots. They take all the station data (typically from airports of all sizes) and output wind, pressure, temperature, dewpoint, sky cover, and precipitation type. Looking at a [surface plot](http://weather.rap.ucar.edu/surface/2013020901_metars_alb.gif)(I know they suck to read), what you can see is a lot of moderate snowfall reports so far. Even some freezing fog reports sneaking in there. The point I want to show here is that this is a good example of why this is a nor'easter. By definition, a nor'easter is a cyclone that impacts the US East coast and Canadian Atlantic **with winds coming out of the Northeast**, hence, nor'easter. These are often the big snow makers.

**TL;DR: Strong upward motion and cold air coming in from a cyclone over the Great Lakes, strengthening cyclong coming up the East coast bringing warm, moist air, collide just Southeast of Massachusetts, snow. NAM still estimating upwards of  for Halifax, GFS/ECMWF upwards of .**

&gt;You may want to include Superstore's Italian Cheese promotion in your list. This coming Saturday the 23rd and next Sat. the 30th each superstore is 'cracking' large wheels of aged parmigano reggiano and selling chunks for 50% off. 22 months old on the 23rd and 36 months old on the 30th.
A rare opportunity to buy a lot of the king of all cheeses at a great price, folks. This is the best sale at the moment.

Lets discuss where we should have a meetup on October 19th. ""But Velkyr"", you say ""Thats almost 2 months away!"".

Why yes fictitious person. However, I just got word back that we **may** have a Reddit founder attend that meetup.

As you may know, Alex Ohanian, one of the Reddit founders, will be at this years pop explosion. I took the liberty of emailing his agent to see if he would attend a reddit meetup in our city.

They aren't 100% sure of his schedule for then, BUT they are going to try to work it in. We can't do it on a Saturday, unfortunately, as he will be flying out early morning.

So! We have the chance to have a meetup with a reddit founder. What place in Halifax do you think he would like, and what represents this city the best? 

Also, I'm posting this almost 2 months early, so no one has the ""I have to work!"" excuse. Book the night off if you need, the day after if you think you'll be hungover. I think this is a unique chance to meet someone who created the community we all love.

And, if you haven't seen it yet, make sure you check out Alex' [Ted Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/alexis_ohanian_how_to_make_a_splash_in_social_media.html).",,False,self,t5_2r77k,False,,DART,True,t3_yrr6z,http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/yrr6z/lets_discuss_a_meetup_for_october_19th_possible/,moderator

Recently I have noticed some bad postering techniques, and just downright rudeness when it comes to advertising your event. Follow these guidelines and everyone get's a fair shot. 

1. Is your poster terrible? The date, time, location and cover/door charge are the key elements of your poster. They should be large, plainly visible and easy to read. Yes, postering is an art form, but obscuring the information in the name of art makes as much sense as printing a newspaper in wingdings. 

2. DON'T cover other posters for event's that haven't happened yet. Ever. EVER EVER EVER. It's probably the rudest thing you can do without outright tearing the poster down. If the event has already happened on the poster in question, then go for it. Some events are notorious for doing this every year, and the local community is getting fed up and tearing down the posters that cover their own. 

3. Spamming. So... maybe you *don't* have to place a poster on every single telephone pole on that one street. All I'm saying is, no one is going to drop from the sky in the middle of that street, a poster on a pole at each end of the street is easily enough. Why waste your posters anyway? Spread em out, hit a larger area. 

4. Don't be an idiot when postering. Yeah, that old lady totally wanted that poster stapled to her porch. Trees really look good with old rusty staples planted in their bark, I tell ya. Unless the Venue gives you expressed consent, don't staple the posters to their outside walls. *Note: High traffic downtown areas have city workers constantly cleaning up and making the streets presentable. This concerns your posters. There are designated collars on some poles on Barrington, and the main one by the old Library, but that's generally it. Don't waste your time putting posters up anywhere else, they will be gone by the next morning. Also you can be fined if caught. 

5. Hit the sweet spots. Postering can be aimed at the right areas to increase efficiency. Is it a technically talented band playing? Then poster outside the music stores. An all ages show? Hit up the outside of High schools. It makes no sense to waste posters and time by just doing the area around your apartment. 


In closing, we all have to share this place we call the Public. The local scene attracts all types, but maybe... just maybe, we can all get along.   ",,False,self,t5_2r77k,False,,HALI,True,t3_1fktkf,http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/1fktkf/postering_etiquette/,

I'm a member of a local costuming group, we're called Maritime Heavy Armour. We spawned out of Hal-Con and do parades and charity events. I know some of you have encountered us and some of you I even know personally (tip of my hat to Fat Apollo)

Friends, today I was at the Dartmouth North Community Carnival. I bussed there. I had a blast. But on my way home, walking through that parking lot in downsview Sackville, someone shouted at me.

He said *""Hey fag! Everyone look at the Stormtrooper! WHAT A FAG.""*

Although I'm sure you'll never read it (can you read?) I wish to place my reply in a public forum.

==== My Reply ====

Fuck you, buddy.

I don't do this for you, nor will I. Ever.

I do this to make kids smile, to make fans giddy with excitement. I do this because people think its ""crazy"" and ""awesome"" and just to see the grin on a person’s face and just know that I've made their day is great. 
I do this for the photos and for the memories that I instil within them. 

My costuming ""fags"" and I have alone raised over 1,300 dollars for the Prostate Cancer Society of Canada. 

What have you done with your life?

I await your reply.

Sincerely,

The Stormtrooper you, unprovokingly, called a fag.

====TL:DR====

Guy called me a fag. Fuck him.

Let them know Halifax deserves better.,mattj137,49,13,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/15vgbr/east_side_marios_is_deleting_negative_comments/,"Hey r/Halifax. The East Side Mario's in Dartmouth closed, on Jan. 1st without any notice or warning to its employees. Many showed up to work thinking it would be a normal day only to find the doors were locked. My friend thought this was completely unjust and disrespectful, so he took to East Side Mario's Facebook page to speak his mind, writing:

""The East Side Mario's in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia closed yesterday. According to at least three different local media sources, employees found out that they no longer had a job through social media, and it appears that they were given literally zero notice. Some even showed up on New Year's Day thinking that it was just another day, only to find out that they were suddenly jobless.

While I am in no way connected with this situation, I think it is disgraceful that an established chain such as this one could stoop so low. As a customer you've just lost permanently, may I suggest to management that they re-consider to whom they sell their franchises, as to avoid situations like this one.""

His comment was deleted nearly immediately along with the comments of several other people.

That's all I know so far. Got a call from a friend. She's quite rattled.

UPDATE:
Here's a news article:

Update 2:

Halifax Regional Police said a 911 dispatcher received a call at 7:45 p.m. from a male making threats alluding to the Boston Marathon bombings.
The caller suggested something similar could happen in the area and police determined the Relay for Life was the only similar event taking place nearby on Friday night.

It's been a pain trying to find a place that's not 19+ only, but we finally have a place booked! We have booked the main room at The Hub between 9pm and 10pm for October 19th.

I was hoping for a more public place, however the only other options were significantly more expensive.

Because I don't know how many people are coming, I couldn't book the workshop space (My choice). This will set me back about $60 (Not sure if taxed?). In order to recoup the costs, I will be selling my body as a giant billboard for NS Power. Actually, I'm going to have something set up by the door where, if you could drop off a buck or two, it would be appreciated. 

You are **not** required to put money towards this. This will still remain a free event for those who choose or are unable to donate a few bucks. You will not be hassled for money beyond a single quick reminder that we setup a donation box for this.

If we get more than the $60 (Plus tax? Still waiting on my invoice), it will be donated towards drinks for Alexis after we leave the Hub (At which point it will likely be 19+). If Alexis refuses to allow us to pay, or we still have money afterwards, we will donate that to Laing House, a not-for-profit on barrington st. Donation receipts will be posted in /r/Halifax the next day (If I'm not working. If so, the day after).

Hope to see you guys at The Hub, Friday, October 19th at 9pm!",,False,self,t5_2r77k,False,,DART,True,t3_11bcft,http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/11bcft/meetup_final_details_we_have_a_location/,moderator

Special Comedy Shows this week

The Mind Diddlers Holidayocalypse show, The Company House, Wed. Dec 12th $5, 9:00 pm.

I like this show cause I’m in the group. It’s weird multimedia mix of live and video sketches, standup and music. We will learn about how to deal with the apocalypse, about what happened in the sequel to The Sound of Music, and where Silverchair got their spectacular name.

‘Look Back and Laugh’ at Sad Rad, 5820 Young St (Upstairs) Fri Dec 14th, $5, 8:00 pm. 

This is a new bad ass monthly comedy show that takes place in a pretty sweet venue. Featuring Dan Hayward, Megan MacKay and Andie Bulman. Followed up by Weed Thief, Slumlord and Word on the Street.

Weekly Local Comedy

Monday: 

Merv Hartlan hosts an alt comedy night at Gus’ Pub every week. Free, 8:30 pm. 

What I like about this show is that that comedians get up and look really loose when they perform. They often try new or edgier material and see how it works here first.  Plus, Gus’ recently updated the stage backdrop from fall to winter trees and you can eat an Ace Burger with a tiny beer. 

Tuesday: 

You can take a break from comedy.

Wednesday: 

Bearly’s LaughterBurner is a long-running independent comedy show hosted by Mark Sawatzky. It starts at 8:00 pm and is free. 

I like how eclectic this show is. Mark will raffle off cheese and DJ Lunchbox hangs out to bring up each comedian with awesome dubstep. Sometimes there are tons of comedians on the lineup, sometimes you get to see 5 comics doing longer sets. Either way, karaoke starts promptly at 10:00 pm.

Yuk Yuks ProAm night is located in The Westin. This show features a ton of comics and is often hosted by the professional comedian that is headlining Yuk Yuks that weekend. Things get started at 8:30 pm and the cost is $5.

It’s great to see some different comedians host and hear their jokes. A ProAm night means you get professionals and folks just starting out. It’s a cool mix.

Thursday: 

On the Ball with Dave and Paul is a newer room hosted by Dave Burke and Paul Warford. The show goes down at 8:30 pm at Dalhousie’s Grad House on LeMarchant St. 

Dave and Paul co-host the show the way an old married couple might. They banter and jab at each other until the crowd is warmed up and then they bring out the other comedians. I like the relaxed vibe of this show. Half the time there are folks playing board games or something in the back. I do believe Thursday is Scotch Night at the Grad House too. Just sayin’.

Friday:

Yuk Yuks has local and out of town comedians performing Thurs-Sat each week.

Saturday:

Ditto Friday.

Sunday:

Sunday Night Comedy with Bill Wood is a lovely show hosted at The Company House. It’s a great end to the week, it starts at 8:30pm at costs $5.

Bill Wood is the master of the over-share. He is an awesome host who is quick to improvise and is interested in the guest comedians weird personal anecdotes. He has an interview with each performer before they get on stage, so you learn all about folks who tell jokes in Halifax. The Company House is a cozy and wonderful venue for laughing to boot.

1348752541.0,30,self.halifax,10k8q8,jane's last supper December 31st,janeslover1234,36,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/10k8q8/janes_last_supper_december_31st/,"Here's the email I received:

It is with very mixed emotions that I am announcing today that jane's on the common will close December 31, 2012.

Our tiny restaurant has served more than half a million meals since we opened. We've attracted a loyal following of regular customers who have supported us and kept our doors open through many chilly winters.

A decade ago when I left my good job with a pension to open a restaurant everyone thought I was crazy. Not only are restaurants high-risk, but entrepreneurship had never been presented as a career option to me. Looking back, my only regret is that I came to it so late in life!

My proudest achievement in business is that jane's has only ever had two head chefs. Chef Henry Strong, who helped put us on the map, and Chef Paolo Colbertaldo, who has expertly managed our kitchens for more than seven years. As much as I've always wanted jane's to be a good place to eat, I've wanted it to be a good place to work.

Over the years, jane's has employed more than 300 exceptional men and women, with a current operating staff of 50 people. We're much like a large family and with most staff 20-30 years younger than me, I've felt like a mother, not a boss, much of the time.

I'm fond of saying that working at jane's has restored my faith in humanity. I have witnessed innumerable acts of kindness and generosity among our guests, from sharing useful information to sharing dessert. I've watched customers get up and anonymously pay for the strangers sitting next to them. I've felt privileged to have had access to so many people at their best.

I want to be clear that I am not retiring, but continuing to grow our catering and frozen food line from the commercial building at 2053 Gottingen that I was fortunate to purchase two years ago. It is here that construction will begin very soon on a new jane's next door store.

My youngest daughter Jenna has a business plan to open a new restaurant at our Gottingen Street property this winter. Jenna was in grade ten and by my side when I opened jane's on the common. Since then she has earned two degrees from Concordia University in Montreal and can write six years of restaurant management on her resume.

I want to assure customers who have outstanding gift certificates that we will continue to honour these at the restaurant until December 31st and will continue to do so at our jane's next door store, for jane's catering and events, and at the new restaurant.

We're certain the next three months at jane's on the common will be among our finest! We hope you will join us for your last supper before we close.

Thank you for your many years and meals of patronage,
Jane",,False,self,t5_2r77k,False,,,True,t3_10k8q8,http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/10k8q8/janes_last_supper_december_31st/,

The trails are off leash for dogs making them even better. They are made and maintained by a group of volunteers as well. I go daily with my dog and son, it's a great walk and I'm super appreciative of all the work these people have done, lots of us are.

Except one jackass. 

Right now there are two mounds of gravel at the start of the path. Why? Because the trails are being tidy'd up and maintained. Go figure eh? The mounds aren't in the way and can be easily walked around. Not good enough for this asshat though.

Actually took time out of the day to make a sign complaining about it. Then has the nerve to threaten to post pictures of the company name and the gravel mounds online. 

If you can't read the pen at the bottom, it's reminding him that it's all done by volunteers and gives him a number to call.

The people working there that I see every day don't deserve that shit. Making matters worse for them three kids with golf clubs allegedly smashed a glass window of a door the workers had on the side of the trail. The kids were about 5 minutes behind us and the window was fine as we passed. 20 minutes later a worker comes up and asks if we've seen three kids with golf clubs because the window was now broken.

If you see this idiot posting anything about this, please let me know. There's a few of us who have a few good ideas of where he can go.

They require you to leave government issued ID with them as collateral (so people do not steal the Brewtenders). At the end of the night, they did not return my ID, and they ended up losing it completely. I am a New Brunswick resident technically, so I have no reasonable way to replace my license since I actually live in Halifax. I have been checking in on them almost daily, and they seem to not be making any effort to find my drivers license. I have the managers email now, but I have no idea how to approach this in a way that ends up with me getting my replacement drivers license paid for, or them actually trying to find it. I definitely do not want bar credit, because the bar experience is actually atrocious, and I never want to go back to this awful place. Does anyone have any advice? 

Edit1: Thanks everyone for all the responses, right now my plan is to go in there on saturday while the manager is in and go for one last ditch attempt at getting some sort of restitution, I lost a lot of my rage about this after I called the NB DMV (I think that must be the first time anyone has said that ever...) and they told me I could get a new ID mailed to me without a hassle if I sent them a letter of explanation and $20. Granted, if Maxwell's decides to try to pull anything on me on Saturday over that measly $20, then I think I am going to go with the HRP non-emergency line, and after that take things into my own hands... creatively. Thanks again everyone, It's nice to know my fellow Haligonians are as sick of this establishment as my friends and I are.

-------------------------------
The last thing HRM needs is another politician overseeing our municipality - enter Tom Martin.  Tom was born and raised in the heart of the city, completed a 30 year career in the HRM, and upon retirement he moved to a farm in rural HRM.  Since, Tom has also worked in the private sector - as a national director for an HRM-based but Canada-wide company, Tom was responsible for over 1000 employees.   Currently owning a Nova Scotia Registered Farm as well as a Consulting/Investigation firm, Tom understands how big business is necessary for our economy to flourish, as well as the importance of small businesses and the plight of their owners.  

While Tom has worked in the background on past campaigns, he has never before sought office himself, nor does he have intentions on going further in politics beyond this mayoralty race.  He carries no political baggage.   Thirty years in public service as a police officer for the HRM shows that Tom brings to the table a genuine knowledge of our community and the citizens therein.  We need a leader, and who better than a man who dedicated his career to making our home safe, a man who lent his voice to victims who could no longer speak for themselves, a man who never shied away from doing the right thing and isn’t afraid of accountability?   What you see is what you get - a proven leader who wants to better his home, our home, not only for us but for future generations as well.

I've got confirmation from the Bar manager at Resolutes' to use their club to chill for the evening.

I'm not sure what you've all done for previous years, but I take it we'll all meet at the Commons during the day, play some frisbee, do up a picnic/potluck- something along those lines?

For that evening, however, we can all move to Resolutes' on Inglis Street for some food and drink.

**I'm planning to get a few board games, like Catan or Munchkins, and some video games**, and I'll convince the bar to do some special drinks (http://www.thedrunkenmoogle.com/). The kitchen closes @ 9PM.

If anyone is willing to offer some funtime stuff, other board games, game consoles, throw me a PM.

Also also, if anyone else is a **member** of the club, let me know.

**TL;DR**
Reddit Meetup Evening @ Resolutes Club @  ~7PM/8PM June 15th
Drinks, games, nerdy debauchery.

I'll try and get the alien posted in a semi-conspicuous place. 7 PM! Hope to see you all there!

WHO: redditors, significant others small woodland creatures, etc.

WHY: Because winter sucks, and you might have forgotten what it's like to interact with other people.

So, in or out?

EDIT: There are concerns re: the Pogue being overly busy. Let's start at the Pogue, and discuss where to go after that. I wouldn't mind maybe The Loose Cannon, but does anyone know how busy it will be? Other suggestions for the followup location to the Pogue?

EDIT #2: /u/OrdinaryBird rightly pointed out that there's an ECMA show at the Pogue, starting at 8. However, after checking the schedule, it appears as though there's nothing happening at Maxwell's Plum.

How do people feel about going there instead?

I hope everyone is having a nice spring , recently we've come across a post asking where to find drugs.

We don't care what you do with drugs, I'm not against them you can all hang around /r/trees if you'd like. 

I know people who would use recreational drugs and I'm all cool with them as they are also awesome people.

Everyone here is free to discuss drugs and its effects and your experiences with them in anyway possible, but distributing and seeking drugs is not what this subreddit needs to be known for, so I hope you guys understand our action of removing any such posts.

If you have any suggestions of where this subreddit should go please let us know in the comments or send us a message through the moderator mail.

After all this is not my subreddit as this is more than 2k+ unique individuals subreddit, me and velkyr are just volunteer moderators who like this city and want to give something back.

Let us know your thoughts and I hope you understand our reasoning.

1327373508.0,28,self.halifax,otvf3,My apology to /r/Halifax,velkyr,49,21,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/otvf3/my_apology_to_rhalifax/,"Yesterday, two posts were made about the Metro Transit strike. I have replied multiple times in both those topics. And that is what my apology is about.

First, a back story. I have a mental illness. My formal diagnosis is Psychotic NOS. While that diagnoses is meant as a placeholder until they decide which branch of psychosis you fall under, in some cases, such as mine and a few others I know, the diagnosis does not change, because you are bumped from the Early Psychosis treatment system (This is a wing of the QE2 mental health section, that takes people mostly on an out-patient term) to a mere social worker who is not qualified to change diagnoses. That is a story unto itself, but suffice to say, I do have something wrong with my brain.

On with the apology:

Over the last 24 hours, I have posted extremist views in reply to the two topics about the strike. At the time of posting, I was full-blown manic. This is a reason for my actions, not an excuse. There is no excuse for my foul-mouthed behaviour over the last 24 hours. What makes it even worse is the fact that I am primary mod of /r/Halifax, mean that the other mod, Sassanix, can't even remove me if I ever get out of hand. While this system reddit has incorporated for mods has it's merits, there is currently no way to remove an abusive mod without moving the entire community manually. While I won't use this forum to discuss my stepping down, if the community wants me to, you guys can vote on it.

So to all of /r/halifax, I apologize for the way I replied to these topics. I was out of line, and I see that now. Believe me when I say I did not then, as I did not have the mental capacity to determine that.

I will not censor any of my posts. I don't see the point, as it merely hides what I go through, and helps me with a point-of-reference for how I deal with things when manic. This is not the worst of it. I was much, much worse on FaceBook in a thread that spanned far over 230 comments.

Again, and to conclude this post, I want to apologize to my fellow Haligonians for my behavior over the past 24 hours.

Edit: To clarify my position on the strike: I do not support the union in any way, shape, or form. It will result in me losing my job, as verified by HR today. However, I do not blame merely ATU/Metro Transit for the strike. I also blame HRM for going to conciliation prior to any actual negotiations. That was a sign of lack of faith in any and all future negotiations.

To take from the wikipedia page on conciliation:

&gt; In conciliation the parties seldom, if ever, actually face each other across the table in the presence of the conciliator.

And that is why I'm mad at both HRM and ATU/MT.

**Edit 2**: I would like to clarify that I would not classify my illness as a disability. Yes, it affects my day to day life, even while medicated. It makes my already difficult job that much more difficult to manage. It does affect my day-to-day life and social interactions. But I do get through it and I do manage, which is why I would not classify it as a disability. There are some exceptions, like yesterday, where the illness overcomes ways I have learned, and ways I have developed personally to deal with this. It's not perfect, but I do my best, and no one can ask more of me.",,False,self,t5_2r77k,True,,DART,True,t3_otvf3,http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/otvf3/my_apology_to_rhalifax/,moderator

The company was Electric Playground Media, as a web dev. Started on Thursday, got my computer set up, got a start on my first project. The owner of the company was emptying the trash when I got the macbook from him, and it kept going... taking up a huge amount of resources, pretty much crippled the damn thing. I checked to see what was being removed, and noticed that a huge portion of it was porn. Okay, whatever. No big deal. I decided to delete the trash from the command line, so it wouldn't kill the computers performance.

Synched my chrome account from home. I don't use Chrome as my primary browser, so there are only a couple of bookmarks. one is to [skullvault.com](http://www.skullvault.com) and the other is a [posing guide](http://digital-photography-school.com/posing-guide-21-sample-poses-to-get-you-started-with-glamour-photography) on [Digital Photography School](http://digital-photography-school.com/). I returned the laptop to my boss Friday, since he said he wanted to get the last of his stuff cleared out. Monday morning I got in, he said that he saw some stuff on the laptop that he was uncomfortable with, and that he was going to let me go. It turned out that it was the two links I included above. I explained that it was google chrome synching the accounts (I really needed the job at that point, I'm pretty broke right now) and that I hadn't visited those sites while at his office, that a quick check of my browser history would confirm it. He said he had checked my history and saw youtube in it. This was true, I had used youtube to listen to some music while coding. He said that he expected a higher level of professionalism and that he was still going to let me go. It was very clear from the conversation that the primary reason was skullvault.com (which is a great site if you are looking fro skull references for drawing).

My HRM hidden gem is the Gibraltar Rock Loop Trail on the Musquodoboit River. It's a pretty steep climb winding through hard/soft wood forest to the top of a bluff which gives an amazing view of the river below.

From Dartmouth follow Highway 107 and then Highway 7 to Musquodobit Harbour. Turn left off of Highway 7 onto Highway 357. Continue along the 357 for approximately 16km to the second parking lot for the Musquodobit Rail Trail. The trailhead is located just a few meters south of the parking lot on the rail trail.

I've seen quite a few mentions in here of having a meetup and nobody decides to take a lead and arrange one. So I'm fixing that right now. We're all going to take the lead. I'm going to put in the comments a few different categories of activities. Then we all post ideas in these categories. Then we up/down vote these ideas based on whether or not we would attend/like them. After 48 hours or so I'll make another post to figure out which out of the top 5 we want to do, and when!

edit: Hrm. I kind of suck at making categories. Just start posting shit we can all do. Up/down voting ideas still apply.

I've a cat and a dog (both neutered and have shots and such) and I also come with awesome things such as a water carbonator, a blender, an awesome collection of books I'm more than happy to share, an amazing set of speakers various musical instruments, and so on. 

I am pretty laid back, and I'm quite tidy. I don't particularly want a party house, but I'm happy to host pot luck type events/potentially have redditors come play board games (or video games). 

I'm okay with drug use as long as minimal damage occurs to things/the pets.

I love GoTime &amp; think it's an amazing idea (I wish the transit system in my hometown would adopt something like it), but I'm beginning to get very frustrated with it. 

For the last month or so, the quality of GoTime service has dropped off significantly. I'm getting a busy signal when I call it about half the time, &amp; the other half it takes 30 seconds to a minute before I hear the blessed ""THANK YOU FOR CALLING GO-TIME! PLEASE ENTER YOUR ROUTE NUMBER, FOLLOWED BY THE POUND KEY."" Even when I get through, though, it can still take *another* 30 seconds to a minute to hear back for any given arrival time. Honestly, I was at Lacewood yesterday and it took me almost ten minutes to get the arrival times for *three* routes. 

I have to assume that MetroTransit has pared back the number of phone lines or servers or whatever they have that GoTime uses recently, but it's still frustrating. Does anybody know what's up?

And before I get comments talking about how I should just suck it up and deal with it, I have seen the Louis CK bit about [how quickly people feel like the world owes them something](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpUNA2nutbk), and please don't misunderstand me; I'm thrilled that GoTime exists &amp; that I can take advantage of it, but it's worked almost flawlessly for me for almost half a decade &amp; the quality of service has dropped off drastically since around the beginning of the year.

They have base machines and upgrade options galore and I called and ordered to be ready for April 15th. 

I arrived on the 12th, cash in hand but alas, they misunderstood and thought I wanted it put together ON that day. Having to work in an three hours I didn't have time to hang around and that is when they nailed it.

An employee took time out of his day and schedule to make a customer happy. If that isn't good business practice, I can't say what is. I haven't been happier with a computer ever and I have peace of mind knowing I am covered for the next 11 months.

I thought that since we're experiencing a bit more of a community feeling (warm fuzzies, awww)... the community that plays together stays together. With that in mind, I've created a Google Doc that anyone can edit to add their gamertags to for the various consoles so that we can have some fun locally and not have to deal with lag too much.

You can find the document here and it will be added to the sidebar soon: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtuPOBjRxoOtdHNLcnpHTTBqZ0pKMS04RUtaZ3NlX0E

Game on!

EDIT: Just so you know, some people will be adding info that do not have Reddit accounts as I've asked the people in the communities I listed in my comment below to add their gamertags. Just wanted to let you guys know in case you found it weird. :)

Just a little story I would like to share. Every day I take the 14 bus to school. Its usually packed pretty much year round and in the morning we often end up driving right by stops because the bus simply cannot take on any more passengers. While sometimes this is unavoidable I have noticed several occasions where there is room in the back of the bus to move and the bus driver even asks the passengers to move back *but nobody puts any solid effort into doing it*. Today on the way home we had to skip two stops because some people in the back wouldn't take seats or take a few steps back. While a certain amount of responsibility rests on the driver to ensure he or she can fit as many passengers as possible in the vehicle it is your responsibility to use common sense and respect to move to the back.

I understand not everyone is comfortable being in a confined space with strangers but this is what you have to expect, accept and deal with when you take the bus. So please, for everybody's sake, please occupy all seats and move as far to the back of the bus as possible. Maybe even ask others to do it too, kindly. Sometimes missing a bus is an enormous problem for people. I hope nobody takes my note as hostile or rude but I feel this had to be said and I hope you will all join me in ensuring that as many people get on the buses as possible.

Thanks

We've been fostering him for 4 months while he patiently waits for a new home. He is very calm, but will bark at strangers (males mostly) that come to the door - easily fixed if the stranger feeds him a small treat. He has no more mounting behaviour but would ideally be suited for a high energy, high activity household with fewer if no other dogs. Still has growing teeth so he does need to chew a lot, don't mistake that for aggressive biting: he has plenty of toys! We can also sell a great condition black metal kennel. Foldable, if needed.

He has had al his shots, is neutered and is house trained. Responds very well to 'Here', 'Drop the ball' and 'Leave it' commands, as well as sit/down/stay. Loves to play catch and can run free without a leash in parks.

Please consider him for a new home! He'd love to be given a chance at having and protecting his own family.

If you've fallen in love, fill out a form here and make sure to specify you're interested in Rex: http://www.ecgsrescue.com/adopt.php or email/text me and I'll walk you through it. East Coast's adoption fee is 250.

No money. No barter. No trade. Try a new economic model: sharing!

Wondering what the heck a 'really really free market' is?

Basically, its a bazaar, a celebration, and a community space for sharing- where people bring what they have to give, and take what they need. Kind of like a potluck, but for goods, services, skills, ideas, smiles..

You can drop stuff off, pick something up, or stick around and hang out! This can include items and services, such as:

- usable clothes, books, music, tools, appliances, toys, pet supplies
-homemade goods, such as crafts, art, zines, baked goods, seeds and plant starts
-services, such as haircuts, yoga lessons, massage, bike repairs, tattoos- whatever!

I had to work in Sackville for a couple of weeks which resulted in me busing by the building every day and not knowing what it was drove me crazy since it didn't seem to serve any purpose but it nonetheless seemed well-maintained. Turns out it's the music room, and only remaining structure from, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent's estate he renovated and lived in in the late 18th century. He landscaped that area of the Bedford Basin and essentially created Hemlock Ravine park. His estate also lent its name to the Prince's Lodge subdivision on the Bedford Highway between Rockingham and Bedford.

I was browsing Kijiji, looking for local jobs. Someone posted an ad (now deleted) asking for a social media manager. I have some experience with social media for businesses and political campaigns, so I sent off my resume. She called me the next day, asked me some questions, and asked for my S.I.N. I said I would only give that once I had employment.

Anyways, yesterday I took part in a ""webinar"" between myself and Shelly. Things started sounding really fishy when she asked if I wanted to run my own business, but I kept going. Eventually, she asked me to watch a video on Vimeo about the company (URL: http://www.vimeo.com/34881113). Well, it really started sounding like a pyramid scheme, so I searched for FHTM Canada, and found many people have lost money in this.

So, I'm just letting you guys know that there is a local recruitment drive for this Pyramid Scheme, and to stay away from FHTM Canada and Shelly Stevens.

edit: I wonder if I'll be sued for defamation. I just sent this email to the Halifax law firm that represents FHTM Canada.

&gt; To whomever reads this,

&gt; It seems one of your lawyers, Lydia Budgen, is representing a Pyramid scheme in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 

&gt; The client, FHTM Canada (Registry of Joint Stocks ID: 3139651 ), is a known work-at-home pyramid scheme in Canada. Don't want to take my word for it? Do a Google search for FHTM Canada. Better yet, take a look at one of their recruitment videos on vimeo: http://www.vimeo.com/34881113 .

&gt; A responsible law firm would not represent clients that steal money from others in investment scams.

&gt; I hope you are a responsible law firm, and drop these clients immediately.

Maybe in early November? Have drinks at a downtown pub or something? I've never gone to a meet-up before and I certainly haven't set one up, so I'm open to suggestions. I just thought it would be a great opportunity to make some friends IRL - we all at least have reddit in common! 

**EDIT:** How does Maxwell's Plum on a to-be-determined Friday night sound to everyone? Maybe around 9:30 pm? 
**EDIT 2:** So it sounds like Maxwell's is a well-liked suggestion, but may be difficult to pull off on a Friday night. Are there other suggestions or do we stick with Maxwell's? (Really, every place seems pretty busy on a Friday night!) As I mentioned in a comment, I'm going to try to rearrange my schedule so that we can meet earlier than 9:30 (not because it's all about me, but because I don't want to organize a meet-up that I can't even attend). Unless 9:30 pm sound good to everyone. 

Also, this is getting way ahead of myself but I had an idea this morning that I think could work out really well if there is any interest. I know there are a lot of students here who may not be going home for Christmas, and there are probably other Haligonian redditors who might not have family or friends in the area and/or basically don't have plans for the holidays. I was thinking we could do a pot luck, not necessarily on Christmas day, but some time around then.

Sadly, your friends aren't me, but if they stopped being lazy and started hiking, they could be like me. Look down, back up, where are you? You're on a mountain with the man your friends could be like. What's in your hand, back at me. I have it, it's beef jerky and some Gatorade cause ain't no fun adventuring and being hungry/thirsty. Look again, the food is now a bear. Anything is possible when your friends adventure like me.

WHAT?
Lets do stuff. I am interested in doing outdoor activities in and around Halifax. I like hiking first and foremost. I like going for extremely long hikes that are physically challenging, no overnight stuff. Not into short walks on a trail, don't ask me about walking in point pleasant park haha. It doesn't always need to be an eight hour hike up stairs, but I just don't want to have a brief easy hike with no energy expended.

I am up for just about anything, my biggest restriction is what I can afford. If we plan it ahead of time I can usually work with my budget. I understand that it's fun to do other things like snowshoeing, skiing, climbing, kayaking, white water rafting, or whatever you can think of. I am very open to trying anything. So I don't want to tie someone down to hiking..

HOW?
I have a car, if we want to go somewhere a little out of the way I can do that as long as we split the gas on any long enough trip. If you have a car that's cool too, we could alternate. I am willing to take an entire day off to do something, so if we want to drive somewhere that's 2 hours away to do a 6 hour hike I am 100% in.

WHEN?
All the time. Now, tomorrow, a year from now if you still around. I want to get out and enjoy life and nature and stop sitting inside. I go to SMU, and I also work, so sometimes I will have a very constricted schedule but I would like to go out at least once a week, but anything is better than nothing. I hope to get multiple responses so I can go with different people every week if no one is that dedicated.

I have reading week starting now and Sunday-Wednesday(feb 17-20). I am free all day every day so that's a good start if someone wants to.
 
ARE YOU GOING TO DISMEMBER ME AND LEAVE ME IN THE WOODS?
Probably not. I will usually bring my own beef jerky so I don't see a reason why I would need to sacrifice you for food. I totally understand why you wouldn't want to go into the middle of nowhere with a stranger, so we should probably meet for coffee somewhere first, add each other on fbook, and make sure we are moderately normal people.

WHO ARE YOU?
Good question. I am 21, in average shape, going to SMU. I threw up two photos of me just so you guys could maybe photoshop yourselves into the photo with me and kinda get a feel for how it would be to hang out together. Spoiler Alert: it's rad.
 
I am very open, I am not uncomfortable with any subject, and I have a very varied(sometimes offensive) sense of humor. I can easily offend people, but I have a very active filter for peoples sensibilities. You don't need to worry about offending me(it can't happen), and if you are easily offended I can filter what I say to be more polite. But really, I would prefer someone who isn't going to make our adventure awkward.

WHO DO YOU WANT?
Anyone. I don't really care if you are a guy or a girl, single or married, 20 or 35. I just want some good  friendly company. Preferably someone who knows the region as I am not from here and know NOTHING about halifax or where to go for ANY of this type of stuff.


Although I won't discriminate, I would like to say please be moderately ""active""? I don't want someone who will get halfway through the hike and want to give up, or make it a strain to be company, or just doesn't have a good demeanor. I am not in perfect shape yet, so I will get tired, but I stay positive and happy and I laugh about my exhaust. I won't give up. I will refer to a hike I did in Maine(USA) where I hiked 4 hours up a mountain without a trail on these 2 foot gaped stairlike rocks, then had to do the entire 4 hours down again before it got dark. And there was a bear following us at some point. I am not bragging, I am just illustrating that even then I was absurdly out of shape and I didn't give up once. Did the entire thing, only took a 20-30 minute break at the top, and plowed right down.
 
I could keep going, but if you are interested give me a shout. I would really like to meet some active people, maybe we can become good friends outside of adventuring too. I would like that!
 
Feel free to ask me anymore questions!

I originally posted this on Kijiji, but here is an imgur with two pictures of me so you can see I am not some creepy person. Feel free to add me on skype klaushouse08 if you'd like maybe meet up and discuss this. Or just send me a private message. :)

The rules are fairly basic:  
  
* The mods reserve the right to disqualify any submission if it does not suit the best interests of the community  
* You must own the rights to the photograph you are submitting  
* The photograph should feature Halifax/HRM is some form
* The photograph must be safe for work  
* You must have permission (model release/etc) from any individuals in your photographs if they are recognizable (street photography, etc)  
* The photograph should be 1600+ pixels by 150 pixels to fit on the banner. The height is not set in stone, but must be within reason  
* One submission per comment (just to keep things cleaner)  
* You give the mods and reddit/advance publications licence to display the photo with the attribution mentioned above 
  
Thats about it! Submissions can be for photographs taken at any time, last year, this year or 1955. You are not limited to the month of the thread.  The closing date for these will be at the end of the month, however since this is our first, we'll finish at the end of the week.

There's an awesome local comedy show happening on the 18th at Gus's Pub that I'm a part of and I just wanted to promote it a little bit because we are trying to get a packed house. 

The show is put on by local comic Ryan Fried and features some of the best local talent the comedy scene in Halifax has to offer:

Former mayoral candidate, Steve Mackie.

One half of the weekly comedy show, “On the Ball with Dave and Paul”, Dave Burk.

2nd place winner in the last “Laughterburner” comedy competition and 100% British, Gavin Liddell .

An original founding member of the Fredericton Underground Comedy Collective, Megan MacKay .

The host of his own weekly comedy show at Gus’s Pub, Merv Hartlen .

From Picnicface, Brian Macquarrie.

Plus Andrew Vaughan (I have no accomplishments to brag about) and musical guests Lucas Diamond and Ann Denny.

-I had not written a single note/lyric for this project before starting.

-I had to write and record it all in my bedroom.

-I was only allowed to leave the house for food.

-Furthermore, I was only allowed to leave my bedroom (where I recorded it all) for necessities (going to the bathroom, showering was debatable).

-I constrained my time to between 5 pm on Monday July 2nd and 5 pm on Friday July 6th (5 days total), and then take the weekend to mix levels (also on my own in my bedroom, but less 'locked in' at this point)


It was pretty hilarious being in a non-air conditioned room, closed windows and fan off to record vocals, during the hottest week of summer thus far in Halifax.  I had a massive bucket of water that I was drinking from!

I'm somewhat new to the 'promotional' aspect of music so if anyone has any pointers for press coverage options I can explore, it would be ridiculously appreciated.


Otherwise, please just let me know what you think!!

Armco is pushing a new road through my subdivision, using Brycon Construction. There has been silty water flowing through the stream into the lake for days. Reported it to NSE, an inspector came out and they are ""fixing it"". Muddy water still flowing, the lake is brown. The day after the inspector comes out, they refuel their machines right beside the stream (the law says they need to be 30+m away). 

I hate that there are no consequences for developers, they won't be fined, or even shut down until the water clears. Nothing. 

Go ahead and call me a tree hugger, but I want my future kids to be able to fish and catch frogs in that lake, and the way things are going, everything will be dead in no time.

UPDATE
NSE issued an order to put up more sediment controls. More rain last night and more silt in the stream (it had mostly cleared) so obviously their controls failed.

Hey guys, about a month ago I posted wanting to get a LAN party organized.  I'd like to set a date and start organizing it, for the middle of this month or in early June, probably on a Friday or Saturday night. (Yes, I realize people will be working those nights, can't make everyone happy)

Currently the only space I would have available to do such a thing is my apartment, in which I could probably facilitate 12 to 15 people if we had 2 people bring tables and some chairs.  Desktops welcome of course.

Other than that, does anyone know where we could do this?  We could rent somewhere out, or something along those lines.

I'd probably ask people to chip in $5-$10 if we do it at my place for power and food.  Otherwise, it'll be a matter of where we end up.

What say ye, Halifax?

At first it seemed like a decent place. They told us to use the bathroom whenever we needed, 8 weeks paid training, everyone was nice. They said we can eat in the classroom, wear our coats if it was cold, etc, but absolutely no cell phone use or electronic devices (Pretty normal rule).


Then as the weeks went on, some of them would get mad at us for eating in the classroom, others would say no it's fine you can eat in here. Of course we just kept eating in the class, until we apparently all got in trouble for ""breaking the rules"".


The training just got worse and worse. We use these systems that I swear were created in 1955. It is a Pre-Dos customer database system, that is not even meant to be used for customer service. It even says it directly on the software developers webpage that it is not a program made to be used for customer service, directly speaking with customers, because it would be too confusing and the processes would take way too long with a customer on the phone..

The training basically consists of, not being able to log into any of the systems, and just listening to the ""trainer"" as she shows your projections of it on a wall and talks about it, for hours and hours and weeks and weeks. Eventually we can login and we're just told to do the same thing over and over again, every day, for hours. But we're never really given 100% of the information on how to do this thing, so it turns into a guessing game 75% of the time. 

Then they keep saying, you don't have to memorize things here, the documents are here to help you. The documents are mostly from 2007 and based around procedures that we're actually told specifically NOT to use. There are no documents that actually tell you how to do something properly. They give you the first few steps and that's it.

[Here's a perfect example of how the training works.](http://i.imgur.com/8oVX72L.jpg)


They start telling us to stop going to the bathroom so much, because we're missing so much ""important information""... I drink a lot of water, I'll go to the bathroom as much as I want.

 Then we're told no bags or jackets or hoodies are allowed, they have to be put in the (tiny)lockers. The reason we're not allowed with jackets is because they have pockets...

Pockets are a security breach, because we could sneak confidential information out of the center. Not jean pockets or shirt pockets, only jacket pockets. If your jacket is soaked because of the rain outside, it doesn't matter, you gotta put it in the locker with all your dry things.



You're not allowed to have any pens or paper or anything at all that you could possibly write down customers information or anything else on, and you'd think the computers were ""locked down"" so that we couldn't possibly just go online and write down every credit card number we see and email it to ourselves right?

Wrong. They block a few sites, email, facebook, stuff like that. But anyone could easily go into any other site and save information. I mean they don't even block reddit..



They only pay you for one 15 minute break during the day. You are forced to take a 1 hour unpaid lunch most days (but they call it voluntary time off), so you end up with a 9 1/2 hour shift, but only get paid for 8 hours and 15 minutes of it. One time I didn't notice that I had an extra 30 minute lunch, so I came back and went back to work. I noticed the next day I wasn't being paid for the extra 30 minutes, and they basically said, too bad, you shoulda followed your schedule (that literally changes any time feel like it)
Luckily they did fix it after I argued, but the fact that they even tried to tell me I wasn't going to be paid when I was clearly working was total bullshit.

They don't pay you to go to the bathroom, but they say you're not allowed to leave the premises when you log out to go to the bathroom. As far as I know, if you're not getting paid, you can go wherever you want to use the bathroom, and I'm sure they won't approve of me pissing under my desk since they aren't going to pay me for every time I gotta pee. They just want to pinch every penny that they can from you.



The scheduling is completely fucked. Me and my class get on the floor, some people are scheduled for 10 hour shifts, almost 50 hours a week, others are scheduled for 4-5 hour shifts, hardly any hours a week.
The shifts go like 8am-4pm, 12pm-9pm, 8am-4:30pm, 9-3pm, 12-9pm, 9-5pm. You're basically going home, going to bed and getting up and going to work somedays. While other people are getting little to no hours and completely steady shifts.

They will literally have you scheduled for lunch, and schedule you for a meeting that starts half way through your lunch, and then ask why you aren't at the meeting when you come back from your lunch. Then they act like you should have known, and you should be following your schedule, even when you're not even being paid and probably not even in the building...



Some supervisors will actually yell at you for taking your break or lunch 5 minutes early.

Today I had a customer with a messed up bill, that looked like he was being overcharged and whatever else. Anyway, I agreed with him, talked to two different tier 2's who basically said the bill was fine, but from what I could see it wasn't. I told the customer it was all correct though, like I was told to. He wanted a supervisor before this, so of course he still wants one, so I say sure just a moment. 

I find a supervisor, our conversation basically went like this:

Hey this customer wants to speak to a supervisor because he doesn't agree with his bill

Well why doesn't he agree with his bill?

Because it looks like he's being overcharged, I looked at it and it really does look like he is.

Then call tier 2 and get it fixed up.

I did, they told me it was fine so I told him it all added up correctly and it was fine, like they told me to.

Good, you can tell him it's fine then, he doesn't need me.

I already told him that, I know he doesn't need you, but telling him the same thing over again is going to be a waste of time.

Well you need to explain his bill correctly to him, you are not doing it right.

I did, i went over this with him 3 times and with 2 different tier 2 agents, I don't really know if its wrong or right, but the tier 2's seem pretty sure it is, and our systems are so confusing I can't really tell, but If i look at his actual bill, it looks way off. 

Ok just call them back, tell them you're a new agent and get them to explain it better to you.

....that's what I just did, and he explained it, and I explained it to the customer, and he still wants a supervisor, it's not going to make a difference if I go say the same thing to him again. 

Ok well you can do it, just explain it correctly to him, you're not explaining it right.

I just said, I've explained it to him as much as I can, and he still wants a supervisor, regardless of if I tell him it's right or wrong.

Well I can't do anything for him, just explain to him that it's correct and our systems have it correct.

I know that, but he wants a supervisor, it's not gonna matter what I say to him anymore.
________________________________________________________________________________

He just kept repeating the same bullshit, and he was saying ""I always take these calls, but I'm just trying to help you"" (He never actually takes the calls, people actually hate that he doesn't do his job)

 I was already stuck on the call for 30 minutes over my shift so I just said ok whatever I'm going home. I go and shut off my computer and grab my stuff and he's like ""Wait man, what's your name?""

I say ""I'm sure you can find it out easy enough""

And as I'm walking away he says:

""So you're telling me you don't even know your own name!?""

I just ignored that, the guy's still being a dick to me, even after he made me angry enough to just walk out.



Anyways I just felt like ranting, because this is the worst place I've ever worked at.

Hey all, 

So I've recently fallen into the position of Shinerama Coordinator at MSVU after the last girl unexpectedly and abruptly quit (a nightmare for any organization, let alone a non-profit like Cystic Fibrosis) and I need your help!

I have an event quickly approaching for Sunday July 29th for breakfast at Applebee's and they've agreed to give Shinerama $8 for every $10 ticket we sell for a bacon and pancake breakfast. 

Specifics: 
When: July 29th 8am-10am
Where: Applebee's Clayton Park
How much: $10 
Why: Because Cystic Fibrosis sucks and bacon is awesome

Treat your girl, treat your family, or show your BFF how much you love them by getting them out of bed on a Sunday. So if you've read this far please contact me for more info or to buy a ticket!

On any given month there's a dozen stand-up shows which don't get a big enough audience to sustain, live-music that plays to an empty room, or vintage movie runs which plenty of people would have attended had they heard.

I would really enjoy seeing some sort of developed hub for events growing here. Halifax culture is in a really bad place, and the main reason is if you don't pick up The Coast, or stumble on a stapled poster on a University campus somewhere you just don't hear about the good stuff. A big part of this is the demographic which has finished up University and maybe doesn't live in the downtown area, but is not partial to old media like newspaper/radio.

I see few greater purposes a reddit for city like Halifax right now (remember the Urban Sprawl buzzwords of the election) could serve then to spotlight this stuff. It would be great if something that could be developed for the sidebar, or highlighted strongly here that would be a persistent story of the good stuff happening in Halifax. 

I am picturing something perhaps where anyone could add to it, (with cleanliness guidelines) might be nice, but to ensure it always chugs along charging representatives or mods to track certain areas would really help.

Beyond underground culture stuff, even things like tech talks, bigger concerts, or open political congress dates would be nice additions.

I mean no offence, but with the hits this reddit receives (and how big it could get with other local forums closing), I've been long disappointed to see it as a place where only grocery lists (not that its bad!), and pithy traffic gossip occurs (...probably bad). I thought since this is a time for change, now would be the best moment to weigh in.

As a designer, I wouldn't even mind doing a stylesheet with some local photography and improved functionality if things got turned around nicely.

Maybe even local blogs/writing/online content creators could be connected via another sidebar category? Really, there could be much more happening.",,False,self,t5_2r77k,1354916108.0,,,True,t3_14gqsz,http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/14gqsz/wherever_the_subreddit_ends_up_can_those_in/,

But if that isn't enough, they are also cancelling an agreement with the ""Friends of McNabs Island Society"" where the society maintained the fort and cemetery area for the past 17 years.  

So here we had a great group of people who volunteered to look after this amazing piece of Canadian history who are now being told by Parks Canada to screw off because their help isn't wanted.  

Why you ask? Well essentially Parks Canada's philosophy is that if they (PC) can't maintain Fort McNab than damit, no one else is going to do it either. 

Personally i understand that our government has spent us all into a hole and cutbacks must be made. But if that's the case than we need to find other creative ways to maintain our history and heritage and I can't think of a more Canadian way than to take advantage of caring volunteers who are willing to do the work for free. It's been working well on McNabs Island for nearly 20 years and there is no reason to stop now.

If you'd like more details, check out page 4 of the society newsletter.

Don't get me wrong, there are a few other units on my street that are housing, but the people who live in them are humble, nice, citizens who are thankful for what they get. I digress.

So back to my situation, the one attached to me has 2 parents in 60's/70's with a 38 year old insolent son who believes hes the cock of the walk. He steals, sells drugs out of the house, verbally threatens children and young teens, plays loud music at all hours, and if anyone try's to deal with him he goes on a rampage calling the cops, by-law, and any authority figure that will listen. This has resulted in many visits without result from police, fire, by-law, etc. and is a waste of city resources.

Today was the last straw, my pregnant wife is at home and flaming mad because he has started again and had by-law come out to my home without result they leave. He then calls parking and has every car ticketed on the street that is even slightly out of line. So my good neighbor who has a cleaning company, her employees just got $50 tickets because of this scum bag.

I have made calls to every drug enforcement agency I can think of, no result. I have called the cops when he is in a drug deal in his home, they never show up. I have called Metro Housing as well as others have called, no result. The guy is a non-contributing member of society who is a criminal drug dealer and a waste of tax dollars and city resources and we are powerless to deal with him.

and the parent organization:
http://www.ca-r-ma.org/home

I've been volunteering with this organization for a few months now, and I wanted to post this to help get the word out about them. They currently have A LOT of cats and kittens looking for homes! It's a registered charity entirely run by volunteers and donations, and all the cats are held in foster homes (no shelters, no kill). Each cat comes spayed/neutered, de-wormed, shots up to date, and tested for feline diseases. There is a minimum tax deductible donation for adopting (75 for a male, 100 for a female). 

Just yesterday I found a young orange cat outside my building, starving for food and attention. I called carma up, and they're going to take care of some flea medication and a vet appointment as long as I can foster her. She doesn't have a name yet:

But as you can see, I have filled her belly :)

I also adopted Cosmos from them in May. Here he is, just cause I like to show him off:

Female, nine years old, name is Amber, wearing a blue shirt with ""Winnipeg"" and teddy bears on the front of it.

Backstory: I just went out on my balcony for a smoke, and a guy walked passed my balcony to get to the stairs beside my building. He asked me if I had seen any young girls around. I told him it was the first time I'd been out for a smoke in hours. He said a nine year old girl by the name of Amber is missing since around 4 PM. He also said the police and police choppers are searching the area. He's been walking the trails and the woods around the area looking for her, but no luck. Apparently the parents have exhausted the usual list of things to do, i.e. calling all her friends, checking the usual spots, etc., but no luck.

Anyway, if you're in the area, keep an eye out. If you spot her, I guess hang on to her and contact Halifax Regional Police. The guy was in a bit of a hurry, so I didn't get much more than that.

If anyone can confirm this story as true, please do.

If this turns out to be a hoax (which I doubt), or she's already been found, then all apologies for raising the alarm. I just don't want to find out she's still missing, or worse, and think, ""I should have posted something, it might have made a difference.""

here's the deal: 15 bucks each. it can be any night of the week. it's going to get cold soon. beer = inner warmth. it just makes too much sense to ignore.

After the intersection, the lane ends in 50 meters.  50 METERS.  That means that anyone in it is immediately faced with getting back into the sole remaining lane or colliding with traffic incoming from dartmouth.  

So just suck it up and wait in the center lane, please.  And if you see someone in the right lane just be a good sport and let them go first, I've seen SO many near accidents there.

What are tenant rights with renting rooms?,AnotherBlackNerd,23,5,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/t34bu/could_your_landlord_tell_you_that_you_cant_come/,"Edit: You all are invited to my place for tacos. Thank you for the responses, especially Lusankya. I cant imagine someone using their valuable free time to help a strangers stranger friend; one of the many reasons I love this place and you all!

**TL;DR**
Friend found room to rent on Kijiji, 'landlord' wants to give her a strict curfew of no leaving after 10pm unless for work, no friends over daily, and no sleepovers unless asked about in advance. The place reeks of dog and she is sharing a micro-floor with 3 other rooms, and has to share bathroom/kitchen with 5-7 people an pays $300+.





Hello fellow Haligonians and Redditors.
I come to you with a situation.

A close friend of mine recently moved from Dartmouth to Timberlea on the starting path to get her live on a better track. I'm in Beechville, and thought the move would be a great idea for her since I'm in the area, plus it's a good area compared to what he is used to with the drawback of being kinda far out the city. Anyways.

She finds a place on Kijiji, it's a house renting rooms; moves in last weekend. I go over there Monday night and bring Community S1 and hang out. The place smells like the inside of a dogs coat. Originally she thought she was getting two rooms, after she accepts she finds out its down to one. There's two other rooms on the floor, all 3 doors are kind of in a small lobby area at the top of the steps. We find out that night those rooms are rented out too. Anyways

The next day she texts me and tells me she just got the list of 'house rules' and had to laugh. I asked, she said too long for text. I laugh. A bit later I ask if she wants to hang out, plus I left my charger there and jokingly add only if it's not against the rules. She replies yeah I would but it IS against the rules.
There are 12 altogether I guess. She didn't tell me all them.
But she said that one said she can't come and go after 10pm unless its for work. She also can't have people over every day and has to give the guy notice if someone, for example me, spends the night, since I did on Monday. She also has to share kitchen and bathroom with the 2-3 other people on her floor, the landlord in the middle floor and two guys in the basement.

Is this right? I immediately responded with anger and questioned its legality, while I googled 'tenant rights Halifax' at the same time. She said its because it's a private home and not an apartment, my response was that I assumed there was still come kind of code of ethics to follow or something. I'm not sure if you need a license or permit to rent rooms out your house, either way though, can he really restrict her, and the others like this?

My search results lead me to a tenant rights document that Dal did for legal aid. And under tenant rights it said that the landlord can't interfere with the tenants life and vice versa. It also mentioned how landlords are supposed to upkeep and maintain etc but said in a footnote that the reality is that's not always the case. True. I can see that with 'major' things like maintaining property and units, but can it slide with respect/decency? She said the note mentioned its to respect other people's spaces, which I totally agree with. But respecting people's spaces and forcing them to treat you like a parent is completely diff. Forcing someone to stay in ther room after 10pm if they aren't working is completely diff. Making a stranger ask a stranger for person to have another stranger over is ridiculous! And I am unsure as I couldn't find in the document, if a private rental and a apartment rental are the same thing, or at least held to the same accountability.

After hearing this I knew exactly where I was gonna ask for help.
Another tidbit of info, I asked if she singed a lease, she said no, and that she doesn't even have keys yet. I told her to keep looking for a place, she said she is but hard since she has no PC, I excitedly told her I'll make a post on Reddit.

No lease, so she can move out any time with no notice I assume. But I was wondering what other options she has? Can she complain an report him to someone IF he is violating their rights, or in that situation would you just have to suck it up or move from a power abusive but kinda creepy 'landlord'?

Thanks for any and all help. And if anyone knows of places renting rooms please let me know.",,False,self,t5_2r77k,True,,HALI,True,t3_t34bu,http://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/t34bu/could_your_landlord_tell_you_that_you_cant_come/,
