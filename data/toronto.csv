I was out with my girlfriend coming home in a cab, power out everywhere. When we exited a man in business attire waited patiently for the cab and offered his umbrella to me while I stood outside and my girlfriend attempted to pay with credit card. System was down and neither of us had any cash on us. Without barely any hesitation he offered to pay our fare saying he had a baby at home he needed to get to and when we tried to ask for a way to pay him back he just said ""when you can pay it forward"".

Thanks for reminding us that people in Toronto can be absolutely amazing. We'll be paying it forward as soon as we have the chance.

Even more amazingly, Hazel took 22 hours of rain to make that record while yesterday's rain only took 7 hours.  In Canada Hazel left 81 people dead, 4000 families homeless, and 1.2 billion(2009 dollars) in damage was done. That set forth a policy of urban planning that gives us the storm drains, untouched ravine land and parks around rivers and estuaries, and culverts and other flood systems you see all over the GTA today. 59 years of hard work by construction crews and urban planners went into full effect yesterday and worked.  A disaster was turned into an relatively minor inconvenience with zero fatalities and minimal property damage.  I think that is pretty awesome.

Edit: People are complaining the two events are not comparable because of winds. When hurricane Hazel hit Toronto it did pack a punch, but it was not at full strength and the majority of the damage and death was caused by flooding.  Entire neighbourhoods were washed out. Mondays event released the most rain the city has seen in a short period of time, and it all drained relatively quickly because of lot of iron rings and hardhats buried in a lot of graveyards had the foresight to think this through.

Edit: Getting complaints I am not thanking first responders like Firefighters.  The point of this post was that the foresight of the past prevented tragedy today.  An entire firetruck was swept away and a team of Firefighters killed during Hazel while trying to rescue someone.  The infrastructure put in place meant few lives were put at risk trying to rescue people today.

Edit: If you look carefully at the now iconic picture of the smiling young police officer carrying the smiling young woman off the GO train you can see some empty ring fingers.

1348087421.0,797,self.toronto,105ld0,As a Texan visiting Toronto....,LOLinternetLOL,925,128,571,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/105ld0/as_a_texan_visiting_toronto/,"Forgive me for ranting but...I have been all over the planet and after spending a few weeks here.... Toronto is hands down my favorite city of all time. 

Living in Houston provides me with extremely minimal public transportation, and I drive 100 miles a day between my home and job. If you take public transportation in Houston, you are most likely homeless, or at least impoverished. The TTC may have its downsides, but it is phenomenal compared to systems in Los Angeles, Sydney, San Francisco, etc. The subway may look small in scale compared to these other cities, but the quality of service is simply on another level. I can step outside and walk 10 feet to the Ossington/Davenport bus stop, and be all the way across the city on the subway in what seems like15-20 minutes.

The level of cultural diversity in Toronto is also extremely pleasant to me. Korea town and China town seem so much more comfortably integrated into the cityscape. We have a large section of Houston which is considered ""China town"", but it simply isn't integrated at all within the city, and is quite a distance away from downtown. Also, we certainly don't get to enjoy the scent of stinky tofu wafting through the air for miles around.

The parks and green areas proliferate within Toronto, and impress on me that Canadians do truly value the impact that such places have on everyday life. Spent quite some time in Christie Pitts and High Park just drinking with friends, and enjoying some of your fine beverages (LOVE that nasty Faxe 10, Holstein Maibock, Holstein Festbok, ciders,and anything Molson). Truly wish the US would switch to the Canadian style of measuring alcohol content.

Speaking of beer, didn't matter if the prices were on average triple what I pay in Texas, the Victory Cafe in the Annex had one of the finest selections of beer I've come across. The beers on tap by Great Lakes brewery and Flying Monkey had me coming back daily. The Highlander Scottish Pale Ale was killer as well. However, for food, I was on a hunt to find the best poutine in the city. 

Two poutine places stuck out to me as ever-dependable. ""Come and Get It"" and Smoke's. Smoke's seemed like it was going to be similar to a typical chain restaurant in the states, but the quality of their Country Style poutine (bacon, chicken, cheese curds, mushrooms, carmelized onions, gravy) blew me away. I was going back to Bloor St for that poutine at least twice a week. Also Spent quite a bit of time at Future Bakery enjoying their Chicken Schnitzel.

Finally, the one thing that made Toronto stand out the most....was the people. I know Canadians from surrounding/rival cities (politely) talk a lot of crap about Torontonians, but for a big city, it had the most kind population I have ever experienced. Even the small cities outside of Houston don't come close to the friendly feel of Toronto. My whole life I've always assumed that southerners are the most friendly people ever, and Torontonians made us look like Parisians....or New Yorkers..(ones that don't give away Gotye tickets). Everywhere I went there were community events going on, free food being given out in neighborhoods, and just an endless amount of effortless diversity. However, this kindness did not always extend to some places....*cough* (Christie station in korea town) *cough*, but overall, I felt immediately right at home.

There is so much more I could rant on about....the museums...the art galleries...Timmies.....the amount of amazing shows...Honest Ed's.....the GRAFFITI....but I've already spent too much time redditing on the clock at work, so I'll cut it short.

In the end, I would have to designate Toronto as New York city, but cleaner, more beautiful, and with a VASTLY lower population of douchebags. I would choose Toronto over NYC a thousand times over. Also, your used video game shops have the best selection I have ever seen. I miss the city already, and hope to be returning soon for some Toronto winter action. 

Peace out y'all, and never take your city for granted.

P.S - *Excellent* bud.

On New Years Eve my friend Mike Pimentel and his friends were walking home from the night out when he got caught up in someone else's fight.  

Even though he had nothing to do with it and didn't know the people who were having the altercation in the first place, he ended up being stabbed and did not survive.

His family, friends and loved ones begged for help from the public but since this wasn't a high profile incident it was swept over and the news went on.

This picture was taken by someone who was there and is the very best lead that we have at this point to finding someone who knows who killed Mike and why.

I can't even describe what a nice guy Mike was... pretty much the nicest guy you could ever meet.  He would do anything for anyone.  Within minutes of meeting him you just knew he was a good person.

You have no idea how disgusting it is that he was taken the way he was; by a stranger, for no reason.

If you know this woman, or even think you MAY know this woman I beg of you to let the police know.  I know it's always a long shot for this kind of plea to work but you just never know.

It's gross that these people are still out there after what they did.  

Thanks for taking the time to check out the pic... I can only hope it leads to something... anything.

Cheers.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP!!!,IMstillBORED,478,98,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1ahyii/lost_dog_at_woodbine_beach_please_please_please/,"Becka is a medium sized brown with black ears and black and white accents. She is a mutt so her breed is hard to tell but she has a lot of Shepherd qualities, though she is much smaller.

She is fairly timid around strangers. She typically NEVER leaves her mom or my (i'm her long time dog walker) side but she was out for a walk with a family friend who she'd only known for a short time when she took off.

They were walking on the beach at WOODBINE and LAKESHORE (Kew Beach Area, The Beaches). She took off around 3:30pm and we haven't found her yet. 

We're doing everything we can to get the word out. If you see her PLEASE let us know even if you can't catch her let us know!

We are desperate to bring her home. Her mom and her pack and I MISS HER SOOOOO MUCH ALREADY!

Thank you so much! http://imgur.com/a/rirwC

UPDATE:  Just got home from doing pack walks today and wanted to take another minute to thank everyone for their attention and effort in passing along my message.  

SO many people got in touch with me with tips and websites, places to call and stories of their own.  Very awesome reddit.  As a newb I am thoroughly impressed : )  She is back at home, safe and sound.  

Someone found her walking around at 2am and took her to the Humane Society where they scanned her microchip and got in touch with her mom. She came out with the pack all day today and was running around like the crazy little girl she is, happy as anything.  

I made sure to give all my dogs extra special hugs and kisses today because I don't know what I do if any of them ever got lost for good.  My heart would be broken.

Thanks again Reddit xoxoxo

Some of us have had our compassion taken advantage of, but others have become increasingly aware. 

Reading the thread mentioned above it's become apparent that many of these scammers have targeted people with the exact same story. If the strategy ain't broke, don't fix it, right? However, it's through hearing these stories that we can warn others, particularly tourists or out of towners, and can protect those with kindness to offer from known con artists.

Let's start a list and share our stories. Feel free to correct or add any of the ones I update with.



**The infamous ""Sticker Lady"":**

* Hands out smiley face stickers and asks for donations for a wide range of charitable causes, including a “youth empowerment fund,” the homeless, sick kids and “youth storm victims” of tsunamis.

Now he had no way of getting into his car, and no money to catch a cab.""

Known areas:

* City Hall

**Black History folks:**

* Group of younger to middle-aged black men representing the Nation of Islam that hand out misspelled pamphlets on ""black history."" They demand a minimum $10 ""donation."" Refusal or lack of acknowledgement causes them to call you a racist. Do not take their pamphlets. 

Known areas:

I would like to say that every. single. Torontonian we met was an absolutely amazing person. Everyone was so unbelievably friendly and willing to help, always giving recommendations and even willing to hang out with us to show us around.

 We had a mini-itinerary that was completely thrown out the window when, while at Snack Bar, a man proceeded to write us 15 different places to go and things to do just by noticing that we looked slightly unfamiliar with the area. He even gave us his phone number and insisted that we call him if we needed anything.


That shit does not happen often here in the States.

We were so impressed with our visit that we've already booked our flight to come in the summer and enjoy your beautiful city more. So, just a sincere thanks and genuine appreciation for being members of an awesome community.

I was on the train today(earphones on/listening to music) heading northbound to Downsview station. I was on my way to York. It was around 6:00 pm. About 3-4 men got on together around Yorkdale station. I wasn't paying any attention to them until I noticed they were separated, standing in different areas of the train. If one of them wanted to speak to each other, they'd walk up, speak for a moment and move back to there spots. I noticed one of the guys staring at me and I knew what was up. My spidey-senses were tingling. I had my laptop and cellphone with me so I was getting mentally prepared to fight for my shit. But I didn't put my phone away cuz I wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt. 

At Wilson station they were walking off of the train and I started feeling like a dick for thinking one of them was plotting to rob me. At the corner of my eye I noticed only one of them was off of the train and another was holding the door for some reason. 

AND THEN BAM.

One of the guys snatched this poor girls phone (In her 20's) and they all started running. She chased them downstairs and that was the last I seen of em.

[It kind of looked like this, but she was at least able to chase them](http://youtu.be/EAgI76R3N_4)

So be aware of your surroundings. I've been warned by family members, friends, and TTC posters about theft happening on trains but I've never really cared cuz I thought it'll never happen to me. But the reality is it can happen to anybody. So be safe /r/toronto.

[Insurance Quote](http://imgur.com/qc2fuGy)
Hmmm... same quote.

But I have no accidents, no tickets and 5 years of professional driving experience and sometimes need a vehicle to get to work.

Does any of that matter? 

Nope I'm a 24 year old male therefore, $658 a month is completely reasonable not like I have to pay rent or anything. 

Until something is done about this blatant discrimination I will not be driving and I encourage you to participate as well. 

When the fine for driving without insurance is cheaper than insurance something is wrong.

When your yearly insurance is nearly 10x the value of your vehicle something is wrong.

When people in certain industries can't get to work because insurance is unaffordable something is wrong.

Make things right! Speak to your local MPP now and stop the insurance companies infringing against the charter and protect your right to equality and end discrimination against age, sex, and ethnic origin.

**Edit:**
I've read through every comment and what I've learned is that while the insurance in ~~Toronto~~ Ontario is ridiculously expensive and continuous coverage is totally illogical and years covered/experience would be a better approach there are ways we can lower our rates.

* Use an independent broker but do your own research and shop around as well
* Sign up for a car share (ZipCar) or have a family member put you on as a secondary driver even if you aren’t driving their vehicle so when you do get your own vehicle you will have had continuous coverage and better star rating which determines your insurance (Thanks Parkesto and NinjaAssasinKitty)
* Use private/incognito mode when doing online quotes. (Respect to ShadowSlave)
* Group Premiums and Discounts
    * accredited driving school
    * being part of a union, university alumni, or large organization etc
    * bundling discount for having your car, house and other vehicles with the same insurance company. (Big up to Felius Rex and RedGriffyn)
* Get your G license ASAP
* Choose your vehicle based on the kind of insurance rate you get
    [A lot of info in here. I haven't even started reading threw it but it looks promising](http://www.facilityassociation.com/docs/manuals/on/ON%20Manual%20Effective%20April%202013.pdf)
        (Thanks ThatCrankyGuy)
* Wait until you are 25

I do have one question though, Toronto is the fourth largest city in North America and the largest in Canada so it is understandable that we have the highest insurance payouts but is that per person?

i worked there for 2 years, but i wasn't given any termination notice or the termination paper to sign. this being an obvious case of a wrongful dismissal, i called the 'starbucks business and ethics compliance' to see what they had to say. the funny thing is, the call opens with a 30+ seconds long automated message, and my phone call would drop around the 20 second mark. i thought it was a reception problem, but my call would drop every time i called, at the **exact** same spot. i asked my buddy to call the hotline, and he told me his call went through to the operator. this led me to believe that they purposely blocked my number, so that i wouldn't be able to reach them and they could just cover up the whole incident.

i can't afford a lawyer to take action against the wrongful dismissal, but i want to share this story with every one of you, and hopefully you share with your friends. from what i've heard, there are a lot of other cases where starbucks baristas were dismissed with the most ridiculous reasons, and the company still got away with them. there are so many other reasons why everything this company does goes against their core beliefs and values, but i'm not gonna list them now.

i am currently looking for a job for the time being, hoping to land a full-time gig (with finishing my studies and all).

* You give video deniers fuel for their ridiculous fire. Say a legitimate video ends up coming out. Deniers just look at your crappy fake video and say, ""see, anything can be doctored these days, the ""real"" video is obviously fake"". And no further evidence is considered.
* You waste all of our time and make people hate you. That is bad. 

tl;dr something about a boy and a wolf.

*edit*: Somebody mentioned that it is 'not obvious' that the video is fake, which is scary but whatever. Here are the reasons it is obvious the video is fake:

* The neckline and collar are completely out of proportion.
* The arms are a completely different skin tone from Ford's face.
* The arms, hands, and wrists are about 18 body sizes smaller than the neck and face
* The arm, body, and face movements defy the laws of physics.
* Dude is holding a goddamn weed pipe, not a crack pipe, **and lighting it from above**. Even if you've never seen people imbibe the type of pipe (crack) and method of lighting (from below) was vividly described in the original gawker and star articles. So all that is required to notice this is to have read the news reports surrounding this issue.

It isn't rocket science and doesn't require specialized knowledge of video editing or drug use.

",psisarah,411,124,408,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/rhk4u/cyclists_of_toronto_if_you_want_to_be_respected/,"Today on my bike ride to the gym I noticed gross biking violations from so many people I felt it was time to pipe up. 

I've been commuting by bike (I don't even have my G1) since I've moved to Toronto five years ago, and in that time I've noticed there isn't a lot of respect for the cyclists of Toronto. And honestly, it's not hard to understand why. If we want motorists to respect us, we have to play by the rules.

* Red lights are not rolling stops. This may be the law in other countries, but not here. Today I when I stopped at a red light at 8:30 am between King and Blue Jays Way, *three* cyclists breezed by me with little hesitation. Cars had to stop, pedestrians were startled and had to stop in their tracks, and the whole situation created a very unsafe environment. I see the behaviour far too often and it makes us all look bad. Even if there's no cars, it's your responsibility to stop at red lights. It's the law, and if you don't like it get off your bike and get on a streetcar.

* When the doors are open on a streetcar, **STOP**. Every time I'm on my bike I see cyclists fly by open streetcar doors. This is a huge pain in the ass and potentially dangerous to people getting on and off the streetcar, not to mention against the law. 

* Use your hand signals. I've seen about one in a hundred cyclists actually use their hand signals. Even if motorists don't know what they mean, it indicates you're going to do *something* and they should pay attention. Not to mention while biking it's infuriating to get cut off by a cyclist who decided to go right and made you stop in your tracks because you had no idea they were going to turn.

* At red lights, be courteous to drivers turning right. I know it can be a pain when motorists push themselves into your path when the light is green, but when you're stopped and waiting to go straight stay back enough so that motorists can turn. It's just polite.

Edit: To clarify, by this I meant when you're approaching a lane of traffic where you're not the first in the lane. 

* Stay off the sidewalks (this was covered in depth in another thread)

If we all start abiding by the law perhaps we'll get a little more respect from Toronto. Plus when you break the law, you make us all look shitty.

For the cyclists that follow the rules of the road, I commend you. Roll on!

It was locked with a big ABUS covered-chain lock and they used bolt cutters right beside the lock mechanism.  

I still have the seat, though, so if you see some joker driving around on a black specialized with no seat, just throw the nearest blunt object you can find at them.

I know i will never find it, and this isn't the first bike I've had stolen, but this really hurts - I don't have a driver's license, I'm broke, and I have panic fits riding the subway so I'm kind of screwed.  I hope whoever stole it gets crushed by a bus.

sorry - just needed to vent.

EDIT - Sorry, I should say where I am...Queen and Bay area.  Such a busy area - I'm kind of surprised someone had the balls to rip me off there.

EDIT 2 - So I just noticed I was down-voted.  I have to assume you're the one who stole my bike :P

UPDATE:

So I'm sitting at my desk, feeling a bit crappy, when a colleague walks in and hands me a card.  It's signed by everyone in the office, and the next thing you know, [this shows up in front of me](http://i.imgur.com/1sXQy.jpg).  Nobody's ever done anything like this for me - I work in the best place ever.

Thank you to everyone for being so supportive and nice - it really helped.

EDIT / UPDATE #2:  I was joking when I asked folks to throw something at anyone on a black bike with no seat - I actually saw a guy riding a red bike with no seat and he didn't look happy about it.

Well, there's tons of heavy construction going on there now, but they only do it at night. Like 9pm-4am. I've called the police on them twice. The first time they shut it down and they stayed quiet the rest of the night. The second time they shut it down and they restarted within the hour! This has been going on for two weeks now, and if you look at the scaffolding they have set up in there, it doesn't look like it's going to stop any time soon.

I complained to the rental office, he put my name on a list, but I asked him, ""What is that going to do, really?""

""Same thing it did last time they had construction.""

""Nothing?""

""Yuuuup.""

I've tried tweeting Karen Stintz (it's her ward), the Toronto Star, hopefully to get someone to care, but no one does. Literally hundreds of people - everyone on the east side of the building from the 1st to the 6th floor - is either deeply troubled (people like me on the first floor) or mildly annoyed (those lucky bastards on 6). 

They're ruining my home! I can't sleep at night. And no one seems to care! Because it's RioCan and they're building shit and we don't bite the hand that feeds you, right?

I don't know what to do. This is frustrating beyond belief.

edit: By the way, Chapter #591 of the Toronto Municipal City Code prohibits construction outside of M-F 7-7, Sat 9-7, except in special circumstances (like emergency roadworks, I suppose)

edit2: And if you think I'm some old bugger telling people to get off my lawn, no, I'm 23 and this is the sound of drilling and hammering reverberating through my walls. Imagine if your next-door neighbour was drilling and hammering through the entire night. I'm a light sleeper, this shit fucks me up.

edit3: Check this out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6GwNcLuQAE

edit3 UPDATE: So, we're totally fucked, guys. TPS just called me back. Apparently my post caused quite a stir! Quite a bunch of people called in - dozens, he said. Way more than they've ever had. He said this is a project that this is going to be going on for 6 to 12 months. And they're not going to stop. We have mechanisms to get them to stop - something called a ""landlord-tenant tribunal""? I do think we need to organize. There is no way that this is tolerable. I'm going to need to move out if this continues, really. PM ME IF YOU LIVE IN THIS BUILDING. I'll give you my name and room #, you give me your name and room #, we'll exchange emails, I'll add you to a list, we'll try and figure this shit out. Either Capreit gives us free rent for the next 6 months or we're all fucking leaving because this is absolutely STUPID. Just WATCH my video above. Who can live in those conditions? I pay $1140/mo for 400sqft for fucks sake. I haven't even fully unpacked because I have nowhere to put my shit. Now I have to put up with this? No way. No way. We need to organize.

So many revolving doors! I have never seen so many in one city before. Also kind of amazed that no one gets stuck or has any accidents in them.

2. You guys seem very passionate about the direction of your city. I heard a lot of talk about the city government and transit (downtown relief line!!!) and taxes...rather nice to see that level of civic concern. Don't have that much here in my part of Australia. 

3. People hold the door for you wayyyyy in advance. Not that this is a bad thing per se. I just found myself having to speed speed walk almost five metres to the door sometimes ;)

4. There seems to be much anxiety about real estate. I get the sense Toronto became ""hot"" very quickly and people are somewhat unprepared?

5. You guys are friendly drivers :)

6. Roads were awful though.

7. So many Indians 

8. So many helpful blogs and weeklys like blogto and torontoist! So helpful to me as a visitor for finding things to do. Other cities didn't have this as much.

9. Seems to be a lot more hate toward the suburbs than anywhere I've been (like calling them 905 ers as if they were some unwanted species of pest). What explains this? I mean people in cities generally joke about suburbanites but this seems quite targeted and mean spirited? Odd since you guys are so great otherwise!

10. So many people called me ""hun."" even guys! I loved it. 

Anyway toronto is my favourite big city in Canada and I hope to come back soon! You guys have a ver cool city! ESP Kensington market and cabbage town 

Have a nice day

I almost feel like there's a bot doing this at regular intervals. What's the deal, really? It's kind-of fucking up the subreddit when legitimate shit gets buried before it has a chance.

edit2: And anyone suggesting it's just one or two people with multiple accounts - reddit's smarter than that.

Toronto man seen damaging Remembrance Day tribute. ,freckledsmile,331,80,258,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1338pa/do_you_recognize_this_coward_toronto_man_seen/,"Yesterday my aunt and uncle brought my 90 year old veteran grandfather to the veterans wing at Sunnybrook hospital for the Remembrance Day service being held. There were miniature Canadian flags being sold at a cost of $20 for the small ones and $50 for the larger ones. People took the flags and inserted them into the grass. There were hundreds of Canadian flags put up in no time and it was a touching tribute to Canada and its soldiers, past and present. 

THIS PIECE OF SHIT in the photos decided to run directly through the flags, kicking them over and stomping on them on purpose as he ran. The crowd was extremely upset. 

My uncle went after him, but the coward took off while giving my uncle the middle finger. My uncle snapped a few pics of him which have been zoomed in on. When my uncle got back he saw a very old man with a very young boy reassembling the flags in the grass. 

Does anyone recognize him?

I got a glimpse of him when he was trying to come through my door, he was my neighbor. Now this neighbor lived in some abandoned house and im 100 percent sure he's on drugs, he has tried this before, a knife was found on the ground. 2 of my other neighbors dialed 911, and said there is an attempted robbery in action, needless to say, not one person showed up. Early today my neighbors and I were talking about it and I didn't know they called the cops at the time and that no one showed up. I called the 12 division to complain some one put MY and MY FAMILIES life in danger and they didn't show up. My cousin started questioning him and telling him how can't people even feel safe in my own home, he hung up. Needless to say I'm scared.

EDIT: A lot of you are saying its my fault I didn't call the cops, and I agree, I should have taken action. Put yourself in my shoes for a moment, you see your neighbor banging on the door at 4 a.m, you begin to assume he's in danger. This argument isn't just for me, it's for my neighbors, they where put in immediate danger and they called the cops, the cops did not show up, you can deny that fact till pigs fly, but I know what happened. 


EDIT 2: I think I just may delete this, all I wanted to do was tell you my experience and yet everyone is just getting upset, I realized my mistake, I don't have to hear it over and over again, the attempted robber is being looked for right now, I appreciate all the kind comments trying to help, I appreciate it. 

UPDATE: Thanks every one for support, the attempted robber was caught in a knife fight. This was not meant to be a cop bashing post, cops are amazing people always putting their lives on the line. The reason the cops couldn't show was that there was a more important situation happening and more people were at risk, its not anyone's fault that the cops didn't show, it was just bad timing to call, thank you all for listening and stay safe!",,False,self,t5_2qi63,1371915011.0,,,True,t3_1gsnmr,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1gsnmr/toronto_police/,

Thanks Reddit!,El_mochilero,260,38,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/170uzv/update_stolen_phone_returned_to_the_police_will/,"Last week we posted a story about how my roommate's phone got stolen a while back, and pictures taken from the stolen phone were uploaded to her Drop Box account. We posted some of those photos on Reddit in hopes of getting a lead on the person and getting the phone back. We posted some of the pictures on Reddit, had a good laugh, and thought that was that. 

Reddit didn't disappoint. 

When we woke up the next morning, we would have the number one all-time post in /r/toronto!!! We were contacted by the Toronto Star, Huffington post, and the radio station 92.5 to run the story. Countless leads, direct messages and other information was offered by hundreds of people. 

The person who has the phone contacted us directly. She turned the phone into the police today and we are picking it up tomorrow!

It is not uncommon for people to have an opportunistic moment and make a mistake. It is rare that those people can have the opportunity to turn their karma around and do the right thing.

Band's playing a show tonight at Horseshoe Tavern and we really need an audience. We don't have a strong following unfortunately and yet we've been asked to bring 40 people. Pretty sure not even 10 are coming. Most of our friends have to worry about school tomorrow morning and family's not much of an option for us.

We're on at 11 and there's no cover on Mondays for Horseshoe so you won't even lose a dime if you come. 

We're four young guys who absolutely love being on stage but we're getting really tired of performing to no one. 

Here's some of our music: http://hottea.bandcamp.com/album/good-things, it's poorly recorded but it's the best we have to show.

It'd mean a lot if you could come, and we promise you'll have as much fun as we do.

Thanks for reading

Edit: Response for this has been incredible. I just threw this ad up here as a last ditch attempt but honestly thanks for the support, and it blew my mind that some people actually came out.

As far as how the show went, we were really disappointed in ourselves and it seemed like everything that could have went wrong actually did, but it's alright, putting it behind us and moving on to the next one.

I work for Bell Mobility, and I feel the daily pressure from management and our executive office to send the pre-written email to complain about Verizon coming it. If I remember correctly they are calling it ""close the loop"".

Every day, I get an email reminding us that the government is treating Canadians unfairly by allowing Verizon to come in. They are sending our stats saying ""So far, 22,000 employees have sent the form, that's over 4000 employees in the last day!"". Then we get emails from our direct managers and directors reminding us of the importance of sending this letter, and reminding us to read the open letter from George Cope about the issue.

Ending a team meeting, my boss reminds those on our team that we should send the form because ""It's our jobs we're talking about here"". I mentioned to my boss that the pressure is a bit much, and I asked if they are tracking who is submitting or not, and he/she said (rough quote) ""I think they can track who is sending them or not""

I don't know if this is illegal, because it's not like they are making it a job requirement, however I definitely feel the pressure.
For the record, I haven't signed. I'm not going to either. I'm a consumer just like you. My integrity comes first.

&gt;The CRTC has recently ruled in favour of big business. In the US companies like Google are testing out 1gb/s connections, while companies like Bell in Canada are testing out $1/gb pricing after a 25gb cap on connections. And now they're forcing third party companies to follow suit. It's outrageous.

My name is Mark and I work at an ecommerce platform called Shopify. This week, I plan on hiring someone from r/Toronto to be our social media and community manager. If you're really, really, ridiculously good at social media and want to work at an awesome company - read on. 


**Why I'm on r/Toronto:**


Last time I hired someone (a marketing copywriter), I made it a public job posting. I received over 800 applications and going through them was awful. **This time, I'm not making a public job posting. I plan on finding our new social media manager this week on r/Toronto.** There's a good chance that the person I end up hiring already has a job. They're not on Monster or Workopolis because those sites are (often) for people who are unemployed. That's why I'm on Reddit. I want to get the attention of the smartest social media minds in Toronto - whether they're actively looking for a job or not.  


I'm working out of Shopify's Toronto office until Friday and would love to grab coffee with Toronto's best social media people. 

**About Shopify:** 

*We're an ecommerce platform with over 40,000 online stores around the world.

*Profit Magazine called us the [smartest company in Canada.](http://www.profitguide.com/industry-focus/technology/canadas-smartest-company-44283)

*Fast Company named us one of the world's top [50 most innovative companies.](http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2012/industry/retail)


**About working at Shopify:** 

*Exciting challenges to tackle every day

*Competitive salary 

*Shares in the company 

*Flexible work hours 

*Free house cleaning service 

*Free gym membership 

*Office 5 min from Union Station

*More [here.](http://www.shopify.ca/careers)


Thanks so much r/Toronto!

**Edit:** ~~It occurred to me that those who want this job may downvote to decrease visibility of this post and increase their chances. Please don't :-) I hope to have as many coffees as possible this week, so chances are I'll get to meet most who apply!~~

**Edit:** I'm certainly going to be busy this week. Thanks to everyone for their support. I've already received well over ~~100~~, ~~150~~, ~~250~~, 300+ emails regarding this position. It's safe to say that I won't be able to have coffee with every applicant, but I'll do my best to meet with as many as possible!

**Edit:**FYI, I removed my email address from this post. I've sent emails to everyone I chose to make a coffee date with and have already met quite a few. Yes, I'm wired as hell right now. If you're interested in the job and want to get in touch, you'll have to hunt me down via social and find a clever way to convince me to meet up. Otherwise, I'm swamped w/ interviews. I can't thank r/Toronto enough for all this support. I love you guys.

This was a good sign as it meant I haven't missed my bus yet. In the distance I see my bus pull around a corner and speed towards my stop. The only problem is I have to cross four lanes of traffic to get to my stop and the light had just changed (not in my favour) seconds before I got to the intersection. I'm frantically pressing the button on the streetlight post (as if that's going to make the lights change any faster) and as I finally start to see a countdown on the lights, my bus pulls up to the stop (diagonally across the corner from where I am). The bus slowly takes off as the traffic light changes to amber and I realize I've just missed my bus and I'm going to be late for work. I looked to the sky and let out a depressing sigh in the form of ""FUUUCK!"" by doing so, I unintentionally caught the bus driver's attention. She stopped the bus in the middle of the intersection and asked if I needed a lift. I smiled and nodded my head. She pulled over to the side of the road and waited for me to dash across the street, run along side the bus and hop on board and thanked her profusely.

They will replace it with another of the same model if it's defective in some way but they won't let you return it, not even for store credit. So if you buy some kind of accessory or other hardware item for yourself or someone else, and after trying it out it turns out to not be compatible or has another issue where that model won't work for you, you're screwed. 

Most places do this with software and media in order to prevent you from just copying it and returning it, but this is the only place where hardware can't be returned. If you buy, say, a gaming headset or a controller or something at Best Buy or Future Shop or Wal-Mart and it's in good condition you can return it for a cash refund even if you've opened the package. At EB, they will only replace it with an identical item. So if possible buy any hardware product you're considering buying there from a place with a better returns policy instead.

This happened to me and it took several trips to the store + 2 hours arguing with customer service on the phone just to get it replaced with a different brand/model of the same type of item. I'm not making this thread to vent or something though, I just think this is useful information given that its competitors have a much better return policy and this could save a lot of people grief/money.",,False,self,t5_2qi63,False,,,True,t3_1508i0,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1508i0/tipwarning_pertinent_for_holidays_ebgames_canada/,

Screw Rogers!,blakeh,221,35,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/o1878/teksavvy_service_outage_rant_screw_rogers/,"Teksavvy service has been out due to DHCP issues for several thousand customers in Toronto for the last 2-4 weeks.

Someone says to me ""Oh switch to Rogers, they don't have this problem!""

RANT:

That's not an option. Rogers is an underhanded company that's robbing Canadians blind. I won't support them, and you shouldn't either.

Rogers owns the underlying infrastructure that is to blame for the outage and it is their lack of service that is causing it to continue. The issue affecting the network isn't physical and shouldn't haven taken more then a few days to fix, yet Rogers has let it drag on for weeks. As far as we can tell Rogers is causing this outage intentionally in an attempt to force customers off competing resellers and back into their slimy clutches.

Teksavvy customers shouldn't be angry with Teksavvy, they should be demanding that the CRTC come down hard on Rogers for failing to get it resolved in due time. Unfortunately this isn't going to happen since the majority of the CRTC commissioners are in the pay of Rogers and will be hired on as consultants at the end of their term.

Going without internet for awhile is less important than supporting one of the few companies in Toronto that is attempting to introduce new alternate infrastructure. If Teksavvy is able to fight it's way through the bullshit and build a new Toronto wide internet network, we'll finally have real competition in Toronto that will drive down prices and force Rogers and Bell to improve their service.

Canada has dreadfully slow service compared to the rest of the world, and it's ridiculously expensive. This will never change while we live in a non-competitive market.

Furthermore - the same can be said for Rogers and Bell as cellphone providers. Cell phone service in the rest of the world is far cheaper then here. The only reason the cost is this inflated is because there was never any outside competition.

Today I relieved to let you all know that the police have arrested the suspect in the case and have charged him with aggravated assault.  Thank you everyone who shared the information about Dan's assault, put up flyers, and sent messages of support and encouragement.   Just before I went to bed the night I created the site it had about 70 vistors which made me feel good that I'd spread the word even a little, now a day and a half later the site has had over 20,000 visitors and a suspect is in jail, all of which has just totally astounded us. 

For confidentiality reasons the police have not disclosed the details of the arrest or investigation so I don't know what part, if any, reddit or facebook played in his arrest (although honestly I suspect it was probably just good old fashioned police work that got the guy).  But whatever it was, the important thing is that they've got the guy they were looking for. 

Right now we are focusing on helping Dan get better and ensuring that the Crown Attorney uses all the resources available to secure a conviction and appropriate sentence for the accused. 

I've spent most of the day between the court house and the hospital so I'm a bit exhausted but I've posted a more lengthy update with more information at:

[http://www.justicefordan.ca](http://www.justicefordan.ca)

I'll be updating the site with progress on the case and Dan's condition as things change.

Again thank you so much to everyone who showed concern and compassion for Dan and acted to help bring his assailant to justice.

I took the TTC home and about halfway through my subway ride the world started going fuzzy with fun colours.  I put my head between my knees and got off on my subway platform.  I had to immediately sit back down and it was amazing how many people came by to ask if I was ok.  This was impressive for Toronto because I expected so many people to walk by without a glance.  The lady who sells magazines even came over with some water for me.  A TTC official saw me and got the supervisor who phoned EMS.  The TTC employees were excellent.  I'm known for jumping on the ""I hate TTC bandwagon"" because of the rude drivers, increasing fares, and streetcars that don't come and then are 4 in a row but I had to share how great the TTC handled my medical emergency.  It was scary to feel as though I was going to faint surrounded by strangers.  
The firemen and ambulance came.  The paramedics said that because they knew why my blood pressure was so low that I didn't have to go to the hospital and they gave me a ride home.

So, Thank you Toronto for being so concerned about the person on the platform with the head in their lap and the TTC who acted really professionally and were really there when I needed them.",,False,self,t5_2qi63,False,,,True,t3_ruz5u,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/ruz5u/i_donated_blood_today_and_ended_up_getting_a_ride/,

Thank you everyone for your continued support and I'll update with more information when we're given the ok to release it. 

We've also set up the email address justicefordanielmacleod@gmail.com if anyone would like to send their well wishes.  We'll be happy to pass those along in the even that Dan wakes up.

On Thursday June 28 at 2:30 AM my cousin Dan was walking along Dundas West Street (Just west of Dovercourt) in Toronto.  He was seen in a verbal dispute with a man and a woman.  The man struck my cousin in the back of the head with a weapon, causing serious brain damage, the couple then ran off.  Since this assault my cousin has been in a coma, and condition is extremely serious.  He may not live (He has suffered several strokes and other setbacks while in the ICU) and if he does he will almost certainly have permanent brain damage.  

A bit about my cousin: He's a 22 year old guy, just about to start his first year at university, not at all a trouble maker, never been in a fight in his life, laid back, likes to play videogames, watch ted videos, typical stuff.   Blood tests showed that he was not drunk when the assault happened. 

The suspects: 
You can view surveillance camera pictures of the suspects here:

[http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/newsreleases/pdfs/23951.pdf](http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/newsreleases/pdfs/23951.pdf)

One is a white male, 25−35, 5’8”–5’10”, medium build with a shaved
head. He was last seen wearing a Portugal soccer jersey.
The other is a woman described as having a dark complexion, 25−30, with long, black, curly hair.

They both appear to be smoking.

We've created a website at [http://www.justicefordan.ca](http://www.justicefordan.ca) with more details. 

Earlier in the day there had been a soccer game between Spain and Portugal.  The male suspect is wearing a Portugal jersey with what looks like a number 7 on the front which is Renaldo's number.

Imagine the following scenario:

There is a line of cyclists in the bike lane, pedaling along at a pretty good clip, when they hit a red light. Everyone stops to wait, and then someone (for some reason almost always a lady, sorry ladies) on a big clunky bike coasts to the front of the line and stops, effectively cutting everyone else off.

Now, I usually give the benefit of the doubt, because who knows, maybe they're turning right. But no, they never are.

Then, the light goes green and they *struggle* to get up to speed off the line with their huge cruiser bike with metal fenders, handlebar basket and panniers, and everyone has to cut out into traffic to pass them.

We hit the next light and the same cyclist does the same thing again! It's like someone cutting you off on the highway and then suddenly slowing way down, in the fast lane.

So, if you do this, just know that I'm behind you, trying desperately to kill you using only the power of my mind.

But this guy was just SO out of line that I couldn't not say something. What a shitty start to my day and ___ day.

This morning I was waiting for the Finch Express bus (#199) at the corner of McCowan and Finch at 6:40am with my baby in his stroller. The bus pulled up and I wheeled my stroller to the front doors and kindly asked the driver if he could lower the platform that would enable me to get my stroller out of the snow and cold and onto the bus. There were about five other people waiting behind me at the stop but none of them offered to help and I also didn’t ask any of them for help because they all happened to be elderly ladies. The bus driver lowered the platform and raised myself and my stoller onto the bus. I thanked him and showed him my metropass and was about to go take my seat when he said to me, “Y’know, you should really get a smaller stroller that you can manage to lift onto the bus so that I don’t have to mess around with this stupid bullshit at 6:30 in the morning.”

Obviously, I was shocked and so I said, “Excuse me?” and he replied, “You need to get a smaller stroller so that you can lift it onto the bus by yourself.” I told him that he wasn’t in a position to tell me what I need or what my baby needs and that if it takes too much time to lower the platform that he should just help me up onto the bus himself. I continued walking toward the back of the bus and he yelled at me (since I was about halfway down the bus at this point), “Where’s his dad? He should be helping you. If he even has a father.”

There were, as I’m sure you can imagine, many things that I wanted to say in response to this. But I already felt like enough of a scene had been made in front of my son and in front of numerous complete strangers who also happened to be on the bus at that time.

I was the last person to get off the bus and was lucky enough to have someone help me down with the stroller this time. I asked the driver for his name and he refused to give it to me. I told him I would file a complaint against him and he said, “Good. Go ahead.”

This is the second occasion that I have been given a hard time about asking a bus driver to lower the accessibility platform. The first time was in August when a TTC bus driver told me that “lowering the platform holds up the entire bus and people have places they need to be. “ I was upset about this at the time but never thought to report it. I figured that particular driver was just having a bad day. But the thing I don’t understand is that it takes about a minute to lower the platform and then raise it back up again. And I understand that people have places they need to be but SO DO I. I resent the inference that women with strollers should just stay at home unless their husbands are present to help them on and off buses. This morning I was on my way to work and I have to drop my son off halfway at his daycare. This is a long trip on the TTC for both of us and it certainly is not made any more pleasant when the first thing we encounter in the morning is a bus driver who has no decency and can’t manage to filter the things he says to the public.

I know that the TTC has a zero tolerance policy for assault against TTC workers – I see posters for it everywhere. But why should any of them be allowed to say whatever they want to the people who pay to use this service?

Also, I don’t know why the TTC has accessibility options if the drivers are so reluctant to use these features of the bus. Would the driver this morning have said the same thing to someone in a wheelchair? And if it’s so difficult and taxing for drivers to push a button for long enough to lower a platform, why not make all the buses kneeling buses so that no one ever has to deal with this seemingly major annoyance?

Most of the time, I am lucky enough to have someone offer to help me and there are even friendly drivers who offer to help which I think is great. But I don’t think that me getting to my destination should be contingent on whether or not people are in the mood to offer to help me. I should just be able to buy a metropass and get to where I’m going.

Although the driver in question refused to give me his name, I can describe him in detail and will do so if you wish to follow up on this complaint. I sincerely hope that you do.""",,False,self,t5_2qi63,False,,,True,t3_15w8iu,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/15w8iu/ttc_complaint_filed_today_for_unbelievable/,

His name was Neil (Bus # 7963 - Northbound 35 Jane) He was cheery and announced all of the stops with a little song and dance (well, not dance but you know what I mean) and pointed landmarks on his way. He'd also say hello and goodbye to every passenger and stopped for everyone. Although there was this one asshole on the bus who kept telling him to shut up and drive and other rude things -- he kept his composure and told him politely that the passenger can gladly get off and find a mean bus driver because he for sure wasn't one.


Thanks Neil :3 I normally stick in my headphones and can't wait to get off the bus and tonight I wanted to stay on and hear more of your jolly tunes. 

EDIT1: I'm glad to hear other people have taken the bus with Neil and drivers like him. Goes to show not ALL TTC employees are mean.

9 AM - I am pulling into my work parking lot as a silver/grey minivan pulls into the lane I'm driving in.. he sees me and cancels his plans to turn in and I pull up in front of him and brake because I have to turn into my work parking lot in less than 100 meters. He thinks I brake checked him and pulls up beside and says ""PULL OVER"".. I ask him where he learned to drive and he says again ""PULL OVER ASSHOLE"" and shows me some badge.

I pull into my work lot and have two middle aged men on either side of my car yelling at me telling me that they are police officers and I'm about to get fucked. Reckless driving, dangerous driving, endangering a police officer, and ""inciting roadrage"". They take my information and tell me that I'll never be able to have my license, or see my car ever again - nor will I ever be able to cross the border.

Keep in mind they did not identify themselves, properly show me a badge or officers numbers or names or which dept/div they were in. They tell me that they can do whatever they want because both partners ""saw everything"" and will testify and corraborate the story. Another mini van pulled up and the police officer starting calling me a ""fucking asshole/bastard/insert name here"" to the other guy and told me that he was a Sargent and that he saw everything as well. They threatened me with basically what is ruining my life, and consistently, continuously swore at me PROFUSELY the entire time.

In the end - he gave me back my license and told me that he hasn't decided whether or not he is going to charge me and it could take a year or two.. made me apologize to him and his partner and left me.

I can't do anything IF he was a cop because it's two cops against me (I'm brown skinned and drive a nice car btw)... and collectively they will have my ass, cost me my job and license and car and thousands of dollars in fines, fees, insurance etc. I don't have the info to file a complaint because they didn't provide any -- I didn't want to risk asking them for it because I read that it makes them angrier if you come across insubordinate - I just let them have their power trip.

What a shitty start to a Tuesday.

EDIT: Due to the nature of the altercation and the way in which I was hustled - I did not ask for any ID, or get the License plate #.. I know - normally I would've but in the situation all that shit goes out the window... I would be the first person calling the OP an idiot for not getting the relevant info or asking for the cops info. I feel that IF they were cops.. they would have actually initiated all kindsa shit against me if I came off as standoff-ish and started asking for their credentials. 


**UPDATE:**

I went to the 33 Division and asked to speak to some of the constables there. The two guys were indeed police officers from the ""intelligence"" unit located next door - and they confirmed that the badge I saw was real and that they do in fact drive those exact same cars.

I was told I could file a complaint for an investigation - but was subtly warned against it because it would ""be putting a lot on me"". AKA - they'll just all fuck me more. I was told that most of the stuff they were saying WAS indeed bullshit and that they were just trying to scare the shit out of me and teach me a lesson. They also apologized for the way I was treated but reinforced that if it came down to it - it's their words against mine.

SO case closed - for all of you people telling me I got scammed and have my identity stolen cus there is NO way a ""cop"" would do this. Be VERY cautious because they just in fact did and got away with it. They could have fucked me much worse and charged me with a lot of shit, planted evidence and probably could have beat the shit out of me for ""resisting arrest"" or because they thought I was reaching for something.

I'm lucky I kept my mouth shut and acted like a pussy otherwise I'm pretty positive I would have got my ass kicked and thrown in jail - ""omg cops cant do that"" - they fucking can and will after the shit I've seen. Don't think for one fucking second any of you have any rights unless you're sure there are 50 people testifying for you. Be careful.

As a programmer, I find that articles [169]-[172] are particularly damning for the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC).

***TL;DR***: **IP-based evidence implicate volunteers of a *Conservative candidate's* campaign as perpetrating the offence against ~7000 *Non-Conservative* Guelph residents.**

***

&gt; ""The ITO explains that Mathews’ **investigation traced the source of the Guelph calls to a pre-paid mobile phone used to engage the services of RackNine, Inc.** to transmit the misleading polling station messages to 6,737 telephone numbers in the Guelph area early on May 2, 2011. Instructions to transmit a similar message purporting to come from the Liberal party candidate, between 2 a.m. and 4:45 a.m. on election day, to the same numbers, were deleted before they could be acted upon.""

&gt; ""RackNine is a voice broadcasting vendor providing digital Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) calling technology. **During the election campaign in 2011, RackNine was under contract to the Conservative Party not to provide its services to any other political party.** RackNine also did voice broadcasts for the campaign of the CPC candidate in Guelph.""

&gt; ""The individual originating the misleading calls used a false name and address in communicating with RackNine and used anonymous proxy servers based in Saskatchewan and the United States to pay for the service through the online payment service PayPal. The pre-paid mobile phone was registered with a false name and address and the subscriber paid for the RackNine service through Paypal using non-reloadable Visa and Mastercard pre-paid cards bought anonymously at drug stores in Guelph. There was no suggestion made before me that RackNine was aware that its automated call services were being used for an improper purpose. Once the account was established, instructions, including the messages to be transmitted, were communicated to the RackNine servers via the Internet. ""

&gt; ""Mr Mathews ascertained that **the Internet Protocol (IP) or computer address used by the originator of the misleading messages was associated with a second IP address** in RackNine records used for voice broadcast orders **from the Deputy Campaign Manager for the Conservative candidate in Guelph.** CPC records indicate that the same IP address was used to access the CPC Constituency Information Management System (“CIMS”) database by 5 volunteers supporting the Conservative candidate in Guelph. Access to CIMS was limited to those who had been approved to have access by the CPC and who had been issued unique passwords. According to a witness interviewed by Mr. Mathews, **certain participants in the Guelph Conservative campaign were overheard discussing making misleading or improper calls to electors during the campaign and setting up an auto dial arrangement for this purpose that could not be tracked back to the campaign.**""

Edit: Bolding salaciousness

***

&gt; The ITO states that CIMS records indicate that a volunteer with the Guelph campaign accessed the database on April 30, 2011 for what appeared to be three ""Demon dialler"" reports for the area. A ""Demon dialler"" report is a list of phone numbers which can be configured with the names of supporters and non-supporters. The CIMS record indicated that the volunteer downloaded the reports to the local computer he was using. **The list used by a RackNine automated server to make the misleading calls appeared to a CPC official to be a list of identified
non-Conservative supporters that was updated in CIMS on April 27, 2011.**

*UPDATE* FRIDAY 2:37. I will be going public with this knowledge in some way, I just need to figure out a way that wont demonize me and have to get my facts straight before I do. .. PATIENCE PLEASE it is easy for you to call names and demand answers when your life wont be changed, be calm and eat a salad... thank you.


*UPDATE* I have Contacted the CFIA and the local media....thank you for all the support! 

I am a butcher at a higher end butcher shop, I know for a fact that the owner is knowingly selling the Recalled meat, we received 50 cases of various cuts from XL or ""exel"" 

the re-seller (who buys from XL directly gave him a refund for the meat and instructed him to dispose of it, as picking it up themselves would be too expensive. Our boss did not dispose of it, but sent it out to be ""processed"" at another butcher shop, and we are STILL using the trimmings from said meat to be made into our ground beef, 

I took no part in it and verbally objected to it...

when meat comes in we take it out of boxes and on to our shelves in our cooler. Once that happens we have NO idea what meat came from where and when, 

I took some pictures that I have and am holding for safe keeping

I hate that our staff is telling our customers that we only deal locally and do not deal with XL Foods when  in fact the Customer is buying ground beef made from the recalled product.

another thing is The Boss is a very very wealthy man and had no need to do this, he is making 100% profit on a product that I wouldn't feed to my dog.

1370222146.0,146,self.toronto,1fjwcs,An Ed the Sock column from 2003 on the Pride Parade. It still holds up the way I feel about it.,budreck,193,47,312,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1fjwcs/an_ed_the_sock_column_from_2003_on_the_pride/,"With the recent Ontario court ruling allowing gays and lesbians to marry, the gay community has a lot to be proud of as Gay Pride week approaches. And I’m sure that sense of joy will be reflected in the annual Gay Pride parade through downtown Toronto. Unfortunately, I won’t see it firsthand because, unlike recent years, I won’t be going to the Gay Pride parade. 

I know, daring to speak against the Pride parade opens you up to criticisms of homophobia, but I’ve been on record supporting gay rights, gay adoption, gay marriage...hell, I’m the least homophobic a guy can be without performing fellatio – but nonetheless, the Pride parade still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

For decades, the gay community and straight commentators like myself have been trying to get across to a frightened population that gays and lesbians are not freaks, not aberrations, not some breed apart that doesn’t breed, but people just like the rest of us who happen to have a different sexual orientation.

And then we have the Gay Pride parade, and all that goes out the window. Instead of seeing our neighbors, co-workers and friends, we see tarted-up drag queens, X and bikers with butt plugs. And quite frankly, that isn’t reflective of the gay people I know. Instead of building bridges, the parade is a freak show on wheels that re-inforces unhelpful stereotypes and serves the propaganda purposes of the haters. It is, quite frankly, an affront.

That’s because the parade isn’t about pride in one’s sexual orientation, it’s about sex, period. It isn’t so much a gay pride as a carnival of fetishes. Hey, maybe that’s one way of showing commonality with the hetero world, because none of the kinks being showcased aren’t unique to the gay community. Leather, bondage, sex toys, cross-dressing and the other fetishes you’ll see in force are sexual behaviours that straight people participate in...so where is the gay? Just because gay people do something doesn’t make it a gay activity. The parade gets pride in sexual preference confused with pride in sexual activity.

Sure, you could argue that the parade isn’t for heteros, it’s for gays and they can party any way they want. And you’d be half-right. But the reality is that for the general community, the gays’ parade is a window into their world...and the window, like the floats, has a lot of cracks showing.

Because hairy guys with their asses hanging out of leather chaps riding penis-shaped floats is not going to help the poor guy closeted at his law firm feel more comfortable in coming out, nor will it help his colleagues comfort level when he does. And an overweight drag-queen dominatrix isn’t helping get the message out for gays or lesbians fighting for adoption rights.

And further, pride is about confidence, and acting out like you see at the Pride parade doesn’t indicate confidence, but quite the opposite.

All in all, it just sends the wrong message. Being gay isn’t about sexual fetishism. It’s about love. The Pride parade shouldn’t be a burlesque show – it should be about respect – receiving it, and giving it. And ultimately, the entire gay rights issue is one of human rights. You don’t get that message watching stocky topless lesbians on tricycles.

The gay community’s slogan for years has been, “We’re here, we’re queer, get used to it” Well, we know, we know and we have...now please grow up and show your cause its rightful dignity.",,False,self,t5_2qi63,False,,,True,t3_1fjwcs,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1fjwcs/an_ed_the_sock_column_from_2003_on_the_pride/,

I hate people drink and drive so I offer him to sleep on my couch. so he came over we watched some TV and then I set up the couch with blanket and everything for him. This morning he came my room and said that he was going out for a smoke. Then few minutes after he left I remember I'd forgotten to charge my cell phone last night so I went and look for it everywhere in my apartment, couldn't find it. after 15 minutes of looking I realized my ipod nano wasn't where i'd left it either. I also have another exact cell phone, but European version that I only use to charge extra batteries had also disappeared. I noticed that my laptop that's hooked up to my TV this morning was somehow unplugged from it. I think he was thinking about stealing it either is too crappy for him or it'd be too noticeable so he didn't do it. The strangest thing is that he'd also stolen my house and car keys. luckily I was very concerned about my wallet and my expensive camera so I took them into my room last night. 

Fuck! so fucking annoying! I mean I really didn't expect people to steal my Cell phones because they are just HTC desire HD which I bought last year second hand so was my iPod nano. That is why I didn't pay attention to guarding them. 

does anybody else have this kind of experience? should I even bother with reporting this to the police? 

update: couldn't believe that someone would steal my keys I looked really hard again for them, but no luck. I did menage to find his pair of socks under the couch. I wonder why he would leave sockless maybe if someone has a k9 that could trace smell it'd really help me out. Also, found my spare key to the car and drove around a little was hoping there'd be a chance that I'd see him around, but no luck. also, I installed plan B on my phone now, but nothing yet. 

update 2: I talked to the super earlier and asked if she could print out pictures from video camera of the guy around 2:30 she just came and dropped off the photos kind of blurry but its some pictures, but I don't have a scanner so can't scan it and put it on here. can anyone help? called earlier to report a crime with the police they said they are going to send someone over still haven't showed yet. I feel stupid after they said they have to send someone over because I have been washing all the glasses we used last night. Also found out that that guy stole my e reader too he actually went in my gym bag and stole it.

Every time I travel, I come back craving Toronto food. 

What is Toronto food?

A place where I can experience the type of cuisine where I just traveled to and have it done well. 

A place where I can go to a restaurant that serves both Israeli and Iranian dishes. 

A place where within a 1 km radius, I can find food originating from 5 continents.

A place where dim sum is done better than its place of origin.

A place where people can meet each other from different places in the world, and create new cuisine together.

I'm sure there are countless other reasons why but I just wanted to share my thoughts.  I started writing this as I got annoyed with travel shows that didn't properly showcase what I thought made Toronto such a great food city.

In the span of a couple hours i was clipped twice, and nearly clipped two more times, all by people riding their bikes down busy sidewalks and not paying attention.  

I understand that the road (where you're supposed to be) can feel a little unsafe at times, especially during rush hours.  What i don't understand is how, as a cyclist, you think that its ok to move to the sidewalk, and essentially put other people (pedestrians) in the exact same danger that you yourself are afraid of. 

You are no ~~worse~~ better than aggressive, anti-cyclist drivers, and i hope you are charged when you eventually run-down and injure some kid MINDING-HIS-OWN-FUCKING-BUSINESS on the sidewalk.

There's a few other thing that are pretty relevant that I wanted to make sure don't fall through the cracks.  So this is my attempt to cover everything that's happened that is directly related to the video.  If I've missed anything, please let me know.

**edit #1:** missed some new developments related to the Anthony Smith murder on May 28th and May 30th.  
**edit #2:** added in the reasoning for starting off with the March 26th story.  Explanation on April 1st.  
**edit #3:** proper formatting in play.  
**edit #4:** corrected the date of Hanad Mohamed's arrest.

Toronto Star reports on an incident where Rob Ford is asked to leave a military ball for being too intoxicated.

**March 28** -   
  
Anthony Smith killed and Muhammad Khattak shot outside Loki Lounge.  According to Det. Joyce Schertezer Smith was the intended target of a ""very bold"" shooting.  Both Smith and Khattak's family both report that neither of them were in trouble and it made no sense why they were shot.  
  
A post on Loki Lounge’s Facebook page on March 29 from “Loki Management” said “contrary to media reports” there were “no altercations or incidents inside Loki prior to the shooting” and the bar was closed to patrons at the time of the shooting.

**Early April - May 3** -    
  
The Star has several meetings with a Somali man in contact with the owners of the video.  He initially shows a photo of Rob Ford, Anthony Smith, Muhammad Khattak, and an unidentified man.  The Star later verifies this.

**Week of May 6th** -   
  
Gawker is contacted about the Rob Ford video.  John Cook flies from New York to Toronto to view it.

**May 16** -   
  
Gawker makes first report on the Rob Ford video.  The owners of the video want money in exchange for the video.  In order to raise funds, Gawker contacts CNN to finance the deal.  
  
Quote from the article: ""But when I emailed an acquaintance at CNN this afternoon, laying out much the same information I've offered above and asking for discretion and confidentiality lest we screw up a pretty fucking great story about the mayor of the fifth-largest city in North America smoking crack cocaine on camera, he forwarded the email to his producer. The producer, in turn, asked CNN's Canada reporter about it. The Canada reporter—and this was a pretty fucking big mistake—called a source who used to work in Ford's office. Within 40 minutes, word had gotten back to me that 'CNN called Ford's office asking about a crack tape.'""  
  
The Star reports on viewing the same Rob Ford video, parroting what Gawker had reported earlier in the day.  They report that two separate sources have information on Ford abusing crack cocaine.  
  
The Somali drug dealers who have the video ask the Star for money saying they wanted to move to Calgary.

**May 17** -  
  
Sources tell the Star that Rob Ford told senior aides not to worry about the video because he knew where it was, citing the address.  Around the table at city hall on May 17 were operations and logistics director David Price, then deputy chief of staff Earl Provost, press secretary George Christopoulos and others. Missing from the meeting was Mark Towhey, then Ford’s chief of staff.  
  
Later in the day, Price approached Towhey with a question,“Hypothetically, if someone had told him where the video was, what would we do?”, and Towhey told him to contact the police.  
  
Price also told Towhey the video may have been the reason that Anthony Smith was killed.  
  
Gawker begins raising money to buy the video via their ""Crackstarter"".

**May 27** -   
  
George Christopoulos, Ford’s press secretary for the past 16 months, resigns along with special assistant for communications Isaac Ransom.  Sources said both men quit on principle because they felt they could not continue in good conscience after Ford’s Friday statement in which he said: “I do not use crack cocaine, nor am I an addict of crack cocaine. As for a video, I cannot comment on a video that I have never seen or does not exist.”

Gawker raises the money.  
  
The Star realized the second man pictured with Rob Ford and Anthony Smith is Muhammad Khattak, who was with Anthony Smith when he was murder and was also shot.  
  
The Star also follows up with Nisar Hashimi who is currently in jail after turning himself in now says. “I’m innocent,” he said. “I don’t know these guys. . . . I don’t know why I’m here.”

Sometime between 4pm and 11pm on Saturday night, someone broke into my house and stole 4 laptops, a tablet, a backpack and some jewellery, in the Queen and Logan area.

Macbook air 13"". Serial number C02G73WUDJWR. The power supply is missing the ground pin (he broke it off in the power bar in his haste) Has a sticker on the lid ""AS IS"".

Motorola Xoom. 10.1"" 32GB. Serial: M136QG3FFC. Has a hard snap on cover.

Thinkpad T60P. 4GB, 500GB hard drive (i added the non-standard drive myself). I don't know the serial number, but the lid is covered in stickers. DEFCON, PWN, Kingpin and a few others.) No power supply (he left it behind) Runing linux

2 x HP DV6000's black and silver, no discerning marks. Each run linux.

A Mountain Equipment Co-op backpack. Black with a reflective silver stripe on it, and a red bike light hanging from one of the zippers. Inside is (was?) an apple smart drive, an apple mouse, and a bunch of other worthless odds and ends.

The jewellery was two rings, one with a mix of diamonds and rubies, and the other with diamonds and sapphires. These are heirlooms from my wife's family, and have a significant sentimental value. One of the two rings had an inscription, but my wife does not remember what it said. 

Anyway, if you come across this gear, please let me know, or call the police directly at 416-808-2222.

HELP ME FIX MY COMMUNITY.",daniellakavitch,167,39,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1jun4i/ive_been_finding_used_needles_in_my_neighborhood/,"Following, is the email I've sent to a number of politicians in my area, and I've also contacted a few people from CBC hoping to get a story out there and draw attention to the neighbourhood. Any ideas on what else I can do? What can I do to make sure my family/neighborhood feels safe, when things like this keep happening? :


I am 26 years old and a mother of a 2 year old. My husband and I fell in love with the apartment we rent in a house near the end of the street, just steps away from a beautiful park with a stunning view of the lake. We have lived in Mimico for 3 years now and what we have come to know of our section of it - this Eden by the lake - is a whole new level of prostitution and drug use that we never had to know in Parkdale, even though we moved from there to get AWAY FROM crime.

This morning was, for me, the straw that broke the camels back, when I stepped onto a used drug needle right near the playground my son plays at each and every day. I went on to spend the majority of the day in the ER, being given the option of a 3 month cycle of treatments ""which have symptoms close in similarity to chemotherapy"", or to decide to watch and wait, all while knowing that upon waiting, any illnesses that arise (HIV, HEP B, HEP C) would be untreatable due to the time sensitive nature of the treatments.

I stepped on that needle, thankfully, instead of my 2 year old son. Instead of the MANY other children that spend the majority of their days playing in this area. This is not an isolated event. I have had to leave the park due to a 'needle clean up' two weeks ago. Not only that, but I have heard a disturbing number of similar reports from neighbours. So how were all of the other needles that have been reported in the last few weeks found? Were other parents stepping on those? Was it all adults who discovered the dozens of needles that have been strewn across our 'Eden by the lake'? How many of those individuals will go on to discover that they have aids as a result of the multiple prostitutes/crack addicts in our community who have been diagnosed?

I am very much aware that this community was, at one point, heavily patrolled in the evenings by police, and during this time (from what I have heard) the drug abuse diminished to a whisper of hidden use. Unfortunately, with the reduction in patrolling officers in this area, has come the explosion of drug use and open prostitution, side by side with the dozens of 2-10 year olds playing in the street and park all through the afternoon and evening.

I am begging you.
Do not let one more innocent person - child or adult - become affected by this nonsense. Do no let one more parent, son, or daughter have to rake the park wood chips before being able to play on the slide. PLEASE bring patrolling officers back to this area to solve this problem.
There is an entire community desperate for help, support, and the reassurance that they are free and safe to live their lives.

I would be happy to help in any way - if you need petitions, interviews, ANYTHING, please contact me and I would be thrilled to bring together MANY people who would give anything to bring this community back to where it was when it felt safe.

Thank you for your time. ",,False,self,t5_2qi63,False,,,True,t3_1jun4i,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1jun4i/ive_been_finding_used_needles_in_my_neighborhood/,
