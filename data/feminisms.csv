**employee:** ...Well sir, that's what we're looking for. You won't be suitable for the position without management experience.

I watch it because I find Sheldon Cooper really funny. But their treatment of women within the content of some of their humor and plot lines really get to me.

We have the episode where the stone-cold sober Leonard has sex with the falling-down drunk Penny who's previously indicated she's not interested in him. She is then presented as 'in the wrong' for her sexual assault because she sent her ex-boyfriend 'misleading messages'. 

We have the episode where Howard and Raj use satellites to spy on the girls in the America's Next Top Model house as they sunbathe topless on what they thought was their private rooftop patio. Later in the episode they actually enter the house under false pretenses to hit on these women by masquerading as cable repair men. 

We have Howard's entire character, who's comic 'appeal' centers entirely around being a creep and occasional perp of sexual assualt. This is presented as 'ok' because it's just who he is and most of this behavior is framed as a joke. He is virtually never called out on it, and the one time Penny actually takes a stand on his way-over-the-line creepiness, she later apologizes for hurting his feelings.

And then there is the most recent Christmas episode, where Amy complains that she is so undesirable that she passed out a frat party and woke up with more clothes on. 
**Seriously?** This show makes the claim that not only should you expect to be assaulted in that situation, but that the victims actually want it, as this would-be victim is **disappointed at not being raped**.
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?
To me it seems like this show is one of the worst propagators of rape culture on TV right now.

tl;dr: I watched the most recent episode of the Big Bang Theory, and got so frustrated by their treatment of women I needed to vent about it.",,False,,t5_2qhba,False,,,True,t3_1501mk,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/1501mk/getting_tired_of_the_big_bang_theory/,

He identified himself as the branch manager and asked me to come into his office. I didn't move and asked why. He wouldn't answer the first few time I asked then he told me that I'm in public and I should be wearing an undergarment. I was so angry and disgusted that I threw my book at his feet and walked out. 
I got to the parking lot and decided, fuck that, I've got shit to do at the library and I go back in. I ask to speak to him and he directs me into his office and bring a female employee in. He tells me that patrons and employees were telling him that I was not wearing a bra (just a unisex t shirt) and this was a public place and it's really in my best interest and it was my safety he was looking out for. He asked me if I had anything to cover myself with. It's Texas, it's hot and muggy outside. No, I didn't bring anything to cover the shame of my female breasts.
He asks me to go sit in a private study room so I can't further disturb anyone. 
Any advice as to what I should do? I feel so belittled and violated. He's a public employee on a university campus especially. This can't stand. I can't walk around this horrible place feeling like I need to be self conscious about my body or that I need to hide it. I'm a grown ass woman. How dare he think he can speak to me like I'm subject to his opinion about my breasts? This horrible load of bullshit has been thrown on me, but at least maybe I can use that to prevent it from happening to someone else in the future. Any advice would be much appreciated.

I had to post this because I saw an anti-false rape accusation poster (written as a snarky parody of an anti-rape poster) on r/mensrights, and I cried. I wanted to share my story with you.

I was raped about two years ago by my best friend's boyfriend's friend.  We were at my bff's bf's house, and the two of them had disappeared to his bedroom for a bit. After I was sexually assaulted, my rapist asked me to go watch a movie with him with my bff and her in the other room. I said no, and he left while I spent the next four hours crying. To add insult to injury, he later accused me of ""leading him on."" Sorry, but my exact words that night were ""NO"" and ""STOP.""

Anyway, I told my best friend and her boyfriend the next day. Her boyfriend laughed in my face and said, ""bullshit."" He said, ""You just regret doing it. I know how girls are."" Even though he was an abusive lowlife, it still hurt. And my best friend said things like, ""Well I'm sure he didn't mean to."" A few months later, when I broke down crying about it, she admitted that she hadn't really believed me. Because of these kinds of reactions, I didn't tell anyone else. I felt like *nobody* would believe me.

I know that false rape accusations can ruin lives. I had a friend who was falsely accused of rape when he was caught in his girlfriend's house late at night, and she didn't want to get in trouble with her parents. He was almost discharged from the military and spent the night in jail, but the girl admitted she was just scared of getting in trouble.

But viewing all people who claim they have been raped as liars, *assuming* it didn't happen, those things are harmful. Of course, we have a system of ""innocent until proven guilty"" for all accused criminals, but we cannot assume that a person claiming they have been raped is ""guilty until proven innocent"" of making false accusations.

Anyway, sorry if any of this is incoherent as this is the first time I've told this story, and I thank you all for reading.

The normal set of behaviors, things like opening doors, pulling out chairs, doing manual labor, and a man putting himself between a woman and danger, are generally seen as being very positive actions by many men and women who are unaware of the insidious nature of benevolent sexism. 

I was thinking about things that I've done in the past before I was aware of benevolent sexism, and I slapped my forehead when I remembered one thing that's so obvious I have no idea why I didn't recognize it: asking a father's permission to marry his daughter. I mean holy crap. This tradition likely has its roots in a time and place when women were considered a father's property until marriage when she became the husband's property. More than pulling out a chair or lifting a heavy box, this cultural behavior seems like the perfect example to use when someone asks you what benevolent sexism looks like in practice: it's well-intentioned, generally respected by society, but it's also deeply sexist when you actually look at what the action implies. 

The thought just occurred to me and I thought I'd share with my fellow feminists. What do you think? ",,False,,t5_2qhba,False,,,True,t3_ylfmu,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/ylfmu/benevolent_sexism_at_its_worst_asking_the_father/,

I think this idea that ""This woman is dressed sexy (or dresses sexy as part of her profession, as is the case here); that's makes it ok for me to now ask her inappropriate questions (or give her unwanted sexual attention, etc...).""

This idea pervades our culture. As a man, I was raised understanding that if a woman was dressed ""sexy"", that means she wants sexual attention. It's not that much farther of a step to get to ""she was asking for it"".

I don't know much about SJ in real life, but I really liked how she shuts this guy down, as she should.


P.S. If you still think this is silly, think why the interviewer didn't ask (and balked at the idea of asking) Jeremy Renner about his underwear situation. He had a very similar costume on.

“Guy’s don’t like girls that wear a lot of make-up. Do you wear it to impress other women?”

I explained that, shockingly, I wear make-up to impress nobody but myself. I am an artist when I’m not stuck at work, and I am a moderately tattooed woman whose tattoos are covered by business attire, so my make-up is a way to express myself artistically that is still acceptable at my job. I view painting my face as no different than painting an empty canvas. I don’t do it to deter or attract a male partner, (I’m heterosexual, but it still irked me that heteronormative culture is so prevalent, what if I was a lesbian?) or to impress the women around me.

He then replied, “Well, it’s feminine. How does this fit in the feminist agenda.”

I explained that being feminine does not equate that you are anti-feminist. 

Again, women’s  bodies are constantly objectified, sexualized, and commoditized. I’m wondering if any other feminists have had similar experiences? What are your thoughts? 

PS- I’d like to say that I think that any gender can wear make-up and look fierce/fantastic, I just use the terms “woman”/ “women” because they are relevant here.

We are both 25 years old. We've only been together for about a month now. Everything has been going great, except when he occasionally uses words I find offensive to describe people. He seems to be unaware of how offensive it can be. He tends to point out women mostly, and call them ""sluts"", or ""fat"". It makes me feel extremely uncomfortable as if I am standing next to an insecure 13 year old child, leaving me feeling embarrassed. I feel like even if he gives me compliments, it still hurts me a lot to hear him say such awful things about other people.


I am aware that you can't change a person, but you can show them new perspectives to think about, and hope that they care enough to understand, or rethink their attitude. I don't want to flat out seem like I am attacking him, or make him feel like he's a terrible person. He just might need to slowly be educated about all this in positive ways.


r/feminisms, any advice?

edit:


Hi everyone! You guys were all great help, and I'm really grateful to have gained so much insight on this. I spoke with him over the phone last night. It helped to approach the subject gently, and talk about how I felt when he would use certain words. Then I showed acknowledgement towards him as to why he probably didn't realize how hurtful his words can be. 

He didn't try to lash back or get defensive, and instead apologized, admitting that he never really thought about any of this in such a perspective. His only ""rebuttal"" or ""excuse"" was that he felt comfortable enough around me to use those words in a joking context, but he said he never uses them in front of others. However, he recognized his behavior, and said he would try his best to be more aware of his words. I fortunately got lucky because he's such an understanding person, and I hope that anyone else who experiences something like this(whether it be with a friend, family member, partner, or whoever) can also be successful.

I'm starting to just not want to post anymore. I know other people have had this experience but I'm just really fed up

Edit: I wanted to clarify that I also had another account that I stopped using because of an ""askreddit"" that I did. I was harshly attacked and stopped using that name. That's why I'm fed up. Yeah, nfgchick79 hasn't gotten a lot of negative karma. Actually didn't until today after I posted this self post in r/feminism. This comment thread has gotten the most downvotes I have ever received on EVERY comment. Maybe someone is trying to teach me some lesson about karma, I don't know. Since I've used this particular reddit account I stopped arguing with people as much because of what happened with my other account. Today plus this stuff combined was what caused being fed up AND I see LOTS of other people have similar things happen to them when they try to speak up against misogynistic speech.

In the following example, a holdup victim is asked questions similar in form to those usually asked a victim of rape.



“Mr. Smith, you were held up at gunpoint on the corner of 16th and Locust?”

“Yes.”

“Did you struggle with the robber?”

“No.”

“Why not?”

“He was armed.”

“Then you made a conscious decision to comply with his demands rather than to resist?”

“Yes.”

“Did you scream? Cry out?”

“No. I was afraid.”

“I see. Have you ever been held up before?”

“No.”

“Have you ever given money away?”

“Yes, of course–”

“And did you do so willingly?”

“What are you getting at?”

“Well, let’s put it like this, Mr. Smith. You’ve given away money in the past–in fact, you have quite a reputation for philanthropy. How can we be sure that you weren’t contriving to have your money taken from you by force?”

“Listen, if I wanted–”

“Never mind. What time did this holdup take place, Mr. Smith?”

“About 11 p.m.”

“You were out on the streets at 11 p.m.? Doing what?”

“Just walking.”

“Just walking? You know it’s dangerous being out on the street that late at night. Weren’t you aware that you could have been held up?”

“I hadn’t thought about it.”

“What were you wearing at the time, Mr. Smith?”

“Let’s see. A suit. Yes, a suit.”

“An expensive suit?”

“Well–yes.”

“In other words, Mr. Smith, you were walking around the streets late at night in a suit that practically advertised the fact that you might be a good target for some easy money, isn’t that so? I mean, if we didn’t know better, Mr. Smith, we might even think you were asking for this to happen, mightn’t we?”

“Look, can’t we talkin about the past history of the guy who did this to me?”

“I’m afraid not, Mr. Smith. I don’t think you would want to violate his rights, now, would you?”

Instead, there are way too many comments about how they ""barged into a church"" are ""wanna be punk-rockers with too much angst"" and are comparable to a group of people breaking onto the field at yankee stadium and yelling racial slurs. It's like nobody even bothered reading a shred of information about the band, the church protest, or what they were even protesting in the first place. Their purpose was not to offend and annoy elderly church goers, or to slander god, or even just a big fuck-you to the church. Their message is trying to convey Putin's exploitation of the church, to urge church supporters to stop allowing their religion to be exploited for political gain and systematic oppression.

He says, here (http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q9qzn/iama_former_nasa_space_shuttle_engineer_created/c3vz0j8)
:

&gt;A man who tries to solve a woman's problems typically ends up with no money, no relationship and a severe drinking problem. He also reveals that he just doesn't understand women.
The perfect response to hearing a woman start talking about her problems is to sit down and listen -- fully and sincerely, and offering no solutions. Brew some coffee. Take the phone off the hook. Cancel your appointments. And it can't hurt to say ""Life is so unfair!"" from time to time. But a man who ""takes it to the next level,"" who offers to solve a woman's problems, simply doesn't get it.
To me personally, women represent the greatest waste of human potential ever -- people who should be scientists, leaders, thinkers, Nobel Prizewinners, and who are more than fully qualified to do all those things, but who instead complain about how unfair life is, and how it's all the fault of men.

Between his bizzare anti-psychology stuff, and this crap, why does this stuff get upvoted on reddit?

Why is it that whenever we see an article about rape in the ""mainstream"" reddits, it's bemoaning ""false accusations of rape?"" I feel like rape is not even an issue that most Redditors take seriously. See [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/f8wq3/it_is_awful_to_prosecute_a_15yearold_girl_who/c1e74fu) for example (which is holding at 151 points right now):
&gt; I would rather 10 rapists be free than 1 innocent person go to jail. For most It's easier to empathize with the rape victims, but not for me; One person's freedom is worth a lot.

Of course, the irony of this post lies in the extreme popularity of the supposedly ""unpopular"" belief that the issue of false rape accusations eclipses the issue of rape itself.

It seems like whenever there is an article about false rape accusations, rape apologists come out of the woodwork to pass their armchair judgment and spew their brand of horrible, self-justified, ignorant nonsense. Reading these threads is like staring rape culture in the face, and it makes me sick.

**Edit:** I feel that I need to clarify a few things:

* I do not believe that ""false rape"" is a myth. I believe that stories about false rape, which often have misogynistic undertones, are disproportionately represented on Reddit, and the rhetoric these articles inspire is troubling at best. Worse yet, in this case it was used to mischaracterize woman's rights groups, by juxtaposing the comments of a woman's rights spokesperson with the conservative bias of the ""False Rape Society,"" which has its own version of the story. That's plain unfair.
* I don't believe that due process should be changed or abridged in cases of rape. What I'm saying is that we should stop passing judgment when we don't know all the facts.
* And finally, I am not saying that the girl in question is not guilty of a false rape accusation. I am saying that, on a biased version of the story alone, we are not qualified to determine whether she is guilty or not (especially because sexual assault is a complicated matter, and sadly one that not everyone fully understands).",,False,,t5_2qhba,True,,,True,t3_f99a4,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/f99a4/in_response_to_the_1_article_on_rredditcom_right/,

&gt;I don't think any of these are bad per se, but honestly, I'd opt to keep feminists in the title. We shouldn't attempt to appeal to a patriarchal society that we're fighting against in the first place. The fact that the word ""feminist"" is demonized, when it actually *means* equality – that people who fight against systematic oppression can't take pride in their own identification – is wrong to me. Anyone approaching a feminist space *should* understand and check their privilege. Ultimately, this is a semantic debate, but there's already the Gender Institute, and we're the only feminist organization (by name) at [school]. These names may very well give some people a better perception of what we're about. But worst case, reactionaries advocating for ""Men's Rights"" could see it as an opportunity to hijack the organization. 

&gt;I'm a Marxist in training, and I don't pretend to like Obama to please my liberal or conservative peers. I'm queer, and will not identify differently to appeal to cis-heteronormative society (unless my safety is in jeopardy.) I'm proud of my African and Native American heritage... I think you get the point.

Most of it seems pretty trans-exclusionary, but other than that I find that I agree with most of what they say.

One thing in particular set me thinking. A woman was commenting on trans women and saying that, if we're really feminists, why don't we share our 'insider knowledge' on how male control and the patriarchy works.

I wondered what my insider knowledge of it is. I must have some because I have seen how men work from the inside, from within male privilege. 

It seems like some radical feminists think that there is an open knowledge of it among men, some kind of conspiracy, but this just isn't the case as far as I've seen it.

The best way I can think to explain it is to co-opt an analogy used by Richard Dawkins on the subject of evolution.

When you see a pack of swallows flying in a group, it looks as if there must be some kind of planning. That the birds have gotten together and decided a set of global rules, and that they communicate the details as they go. This isn't the case. They work on instinct, they follow local rules that get programmed into them from birth.

And that's pretty much how patriarchy works in my experience. Men haven't all gotten together. It works, either on some kind of instinct, or rules subconsciously programmed into them from birth.

I was wondering what other women's views were on that. Particularly other trans women, another viewpoint from the situation would be interesting.",,False,,t5_2qhba,False,,,True,t3_142azd,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/142azd/some_thoughts_from_a_trans_woman_on_radical/,

""Sen. Greg Reed, R-Jasper, voted to move Senate Bill 12 out of committee last week because he said it’s a good bill that would help “a mother to understand that a live baby is inside her body.”""

Sen. Reed is not a woman.  He is not capable of childbirth.  He seems to find it difficult to understand the concept of a fetus forming inside a person.  I get the impression that just because HE can't understand that he assumes women also can't.  Except, a pregnant woman would be a better authority of what's going on inside her.  She's the one in the situation, she would know better the gravity.   

It just seems to me a lot of these anti-women bills are created on the insecurity of male congresspeople, projecting their own inability to understand an issue onto those it actually affects.   It almost even seems that these congressmen assume women can't know better than they, demonstrating extreme arrogance and a further need for diversity in political representation.",,False,,t5_2qhba,False,,,True,t3_q9wi5,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/q9wi5/is_it_just_me_or_do_congressmen_in_support_of_the/,

I'm about as privileged as one can get, so every day my eyes are opened wider to this.

I've started finding or inventing subtle ways to change the norm around me. For example, in conversation, I've started using ""she"" as my typical default pronoun. I also like to say ""she or he"" where one might normally say ""he or she""—except in cases when the ordinary expectation would be for the ""she"" to come first, in which case I deliberately put ""he"" first.

And there are slightly more obnoxious ones I indulge in, such as if my housemates are watching some overblown male-y movie, I make some quiet provocative comment such as ""Shocking. That woman just escaped a burning truck, but her hair and makeup are brand-new. But the guys are covered in blood and sweat."" Usually nobody responds.

What little social tricks do you all use to turn ordinary (patriarchally-normative) conversation on its head?

I value others' contributions highly, especially in the feminist channels, and it's very rare I downvote anybody, excepting trolls. Even the bad articles I just calmly comment on and explain why I disagree. But the unexplained downvote is the epitome of Reddit nastiness: kill the topic without even acknowledging it. I hope all ten downvotes are from MRAs, not from feminists, because feminists are generally people who know what it's like to be spurned without being acknowledged.

She reads Biology, independently came up with astronomy, paints murals, as well as cooks and cleans and sews, embracing more than the traditionally feminine roles.
2. She holds her own - knocking out the intruder Flynn, attacking scary thugs, and standing up to her ""mother"" when they meet in the woods.
3. She plans her own escape after she learns she's trapped, instead of just waiting for a rescue.  Flynn happening by at the point is a coincidence she exploits.
4. Plenty of men embracing their feminine side.  The bar full of manly ruffians like to sing, play piano, mime, make porcelain unicorns, as part of their dreams.  They sympathize with her dream of seeing the festival of lights.
5. The king is the one crying about his lost daughter.  His wife the queen was the one consoling him.
6. The villain is symbolic of that old notion that women must be kept inside and guarded.  Tangled asks why someone who escaped that would want to go back.
7. The villain spits out insults (calls the Rapunzel fat, clumsy) while saying that she's only kidding, not to take it seriously, addressing the wearing-down and harmful effect of treatment.
8. The traditional woman sacrificing herself at the end is turned on its head. (that's all I'll say.)
9. She dips him to kiss him.
10. She finds her own independence.  Really, she only keeps Flynn on because she chooses to.
11. Flynn admits that he's hypermasculined himself to make himself fit some ideal he read about in a book.  Rapunzel says she likes the real him better.
12. She named her pet Pascal.
13. She did not get married at 18.
14. She never uses her curves or fluttering lashes to get what she needs.
15. She does need rescuing, but just as often so does Flynn.
16. Her frying pan serves as a superior weapon to a sword.
17. It passes the Bechdel test.

Plus, the horse was really fracking awesome.  One of my favorite movies of all time, and a Disney movie has never claimed that from me before.

There are some minor quibbles, not going to deny.  And continuing to quibble is how we always push progress forward, but for now I'm happy to applaud when someone makes that step in the right direction.  (One place in particular it chickened out.)  But eff, it was the kind of high-quality, pro-equality ""princess"" movie I never had as a kid.

I yearn to be independent, to be myself, and not let anything, including my gender stop me. I want to be judged on my actions and try to give others the same benefit.

My stumbling block is that I am an Hispanic woman in the south. The culture of where I grew up is not kind to feminist ideals.  There were always things that I enjoyed that were ""masculine"": construction trucks(as a wee one), large subs for cars, math, building things, race cars. 

Some things were seen as ""acceptable"" and by that I mean it was ""sexy"" if a woman could hold her own or take care of her car. Others brought shock and confusion to my parents and family. I wasn't ""lady like"" in any sense. I didn't and don't wear makeup often, I have no desire to have children, I would rather have a band saw then jimmy chos. And I enjoyed it. I liked doing what I did and watching my parents squirm when I wore lady-suits instead of dresses. 

I dated and found men who shared my ideals. I went on a date to a science museum and people couldn't fathom why I didn't want to go to an upscale restaurant instead. But I loved what I loved and found people to date who shared my interests. I asked men on dates, I paid if I asked and he paid if he did. I dated men smarter then me and men who weren't as smart.

My parents and my grandmother were proud of my mind. I was beyond bright and took to the sciences. 

My parents were ashamed of my appearance. No matter how smart or accomplished I was, a man would never want me like this, my parents would insist. They want a girl to look good, to show off. They want a girl who dresses nicer, who is thinner, who wears make-up, and can cook and do housework.  Even the nerd boys who I dated, with the unkept hair, ratty jeans, and unkept hair expect me to be made up all the time they claimed.

My grandmother bragged about me to her friends; her granddaughter who was so good at math. 

What did it mean for me growing up, being a woman in the south? I learned that very young. I heard the message from every adult, saw it all over. No matter my mind I was to be judged on my feminine qualities or lack there of. Woman took care of the house, even when my mom worked more hours then my dad. Men were to pay for me, to open doors for me, to take CARE OF ME. me! Who thought herself so independent was mistaken it seemed. 

""You are so lucky"" my grandmother tells me ""when I was your age there were only 3 jobs a woman could have: nurse, secretary, or teacher.""

I am a long-time redditor and life-long supporter of women's rights. I am part of a new non-profit organization, and we are campaigning this March to raise $21,000 for a domestic violence shelter in Armenia.

Women's rights and domestic violence are taboo issues in this country, and the statistics are frightening. We want to not only use this campaign to support this domestic violence shelter, but also to raise awareness, get rid of the taboo, and empower women.

We try to use social media to raise awareness and crowdfund this project, but I am posting on /r/women to ask you for your advice. How can I reach out to more women around the world to gain support for this campaign?

Thank you &amp; fight on.

I thought it was a strange remark because I didn't think she was doing that at all. She was interrupting to moderate, not to say anything about herself. 

I wondered if this guy would have interpreted her behavior as attention-seeking if a man had done the same thing, and if in this case ""attention-seeking"" isn't code for ""uppity woman who should stfu and not tell men what to do."" 

I feel like it's really weird how often women are denigrated for seeking attention, and I'm beginning to see it as a silencing tactic. What do you guys think?

Girls are not born less angry and more anxious, they’re rewarded for being less angry and more anxious. So, it should come as no surprise to anyone that large groups of stressed out girls and women collectively facing the dissolution of a cohesive social structure might be more disposed to fall prey to mass psychosis. It is arguable that men and boys experience similarly jarring episodes of anger and anxiety-channelling mass psychosis, but we call it male aggression and fund military industrial complexes to deal with it.”

I feel incredibly strongly about these issues, and there's definitely some ends-justifying-the-means thinking involved on my part, but I also genuinely feel that revealing my own gender and orientation will make my words easier for other men to relate to, and hopefully, pay heed to.  Dismissing arguments from those with a clear vested interest is one of the most common fallacies used in arguments online, and it's my thinking that by stating my argument from a position of (apparently^) contrary interest, it may engage men who might otherwise relegate feminist ideas to women alone.

I'm curious to hear opinions on this habit from other feminists, because I'm not sure if it's an effective tactic for me to be using, or if it doesn't perpetuate the very ideas it hopes to destroy.

 I came to find out she wanted more, I told her I just wanted to remain friends, and thought we would be better off as such; she didn't agree one bit. She began to pour kindness into me, bringing cookies, dressing ""up"" more when we hung out and the like. It got weird and a little bit scary to be honest.

Him: Like, when a man takes care of his children, cleans up after himself, or respects his mother, people act like it's amazing, but it really should be the basic standard.

The [Prison Rape Elimination Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Rape_Elimination_Act_of_2003) (PREA) forced a review of all prison procedures. The methodology is described in the NYBooks article and the wiki article. ""The standards became legally binding for federal facilities run by the Bureau of Prisons on August 20."" (NYBooks.com).

These are [the groups](http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lookup.php?type=i&amp;q=Prison+rape+elimination+act) that lobbied for this bill which is believed will prevent most acts of prison rape from being able to occur. Best of all, the overarching legislation will be targeted at treating prisoners humanely and was written in gender neutral language. The following list of lobbying groups taken from the OpenSecrets.org link.

&gt; American Civil Liberties Union

&gt; NAACP

&gt;National Council of La Raza

&gt;Human Rights Watch

Can the community educate a very ignorant man?",,70,22,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/uz0pd/rfeminisms_i_need_your_help_please_can_the/,"So as of a few hours ago, I can clearly say that I lost perhaps my bestest friend due to my own ignorance. Sorry for the wall of text but I hope some of you can hear me out. Let me give you a bit of background. I am a 20 year old male. My female best friend and I have been on again/off-again friends since 2008, but we became really close friends when she moved from Germany (she lives on a military base) to Boston to go to school. Since that time, she has changed to a very active and passionate feminist. That irked me. It irked me because it seemed like every possible moment we talked, she had to get on a soap-box and tell me about how poor women had it. When I would try to engage her in discussion, she would get really angry or I would (or the most common result, both of us would) and we would cease to talk for a few days. Part of my anger came from defensiveness (not all guys are like this or that!) and some of my anger came from the fact that she wasn't the same person that she used to be.



However, just today I believe I used the straw that broke the camel's back or however that idiom goes. We slipped into that familiar routine however I believe today I overstepped my bounds. I pretty much contradicted every thing she had to say, questioned every fact, and pretty much exhibited sexist behavior whether I knew it or not (""surprisingly there are a lot of pretty girls in Engineering at my school"" being an example). She was very hurt, and took the time to give me my facts that I wanted however ended with this:



""Don't treat this lightly, please. Even now, I am forced not to scream at you, because you would stop listening to me. this is even more privilege, to cast me off as a crazy feminist because I am angry and saying things you don't want to hear. I am not the best at arguing this and the most I can say to you is to read more eloquent arguments of other feminists. But I do know this. The things you said to me, the things that I regurgitated to you made me very uncomfortable, and very angry and very disappointed. I do not feel safe talking to you right now please understand that I am not being ""dramatic"" and I am not ""exaggerating"". this is legitimately how your words made me feel and my feelings cannot be wrong. Please take the time to review the things I sent you. I just want you to understand that the things I say are valid whether I support them with facts or not– my voice is valid. I argued that women aren't taken seriously during rape cases and you responded by not taking me seriously. 'Without the facts'

thank you for listening.""

I felt like crying, and the more I think about it now that I cooled down and surfed some of those links she sent me: my behavior was abhorable. I realized that indeed my defensiveness was my privilege showing and I had no right to get defensive or angry. So this is my plea:

Can you guys please bombard me with as much feminist things you can possibly think of? Anything that I can use to educate myself on this topic. Even if she and I never become friends again, I would like to be educated on this topic that I so clearly misunderstand and have offended. Links, articles, books, movies/clips, blogs, etc. Anything that can help me learn about feminism/GenderWomen'sStudies. Thank you.

**TL;DR= Please give me any feminist literature/articles/blogs/stats that can educate an ignorant guy like myself.**

I and shocked, horrified, and dumbfounded.",,66,15,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/aoi0d/i_just_finished_reading_the_feminine_mystique_i/,"I am 28. I guess I take it for granted that I, as a woman, am considered a whole human being with every right to fulfill my potential as a man. I had no idea how BAD it was - or rather I had a simpleminded idea that didn't take into account the actuality of living to the housewife expectations. But I think I am most shaken by the notion that I just read, in essence, about what eventually killed my mother.

My mother killed herself in 2006. She was raised within the mystique to a pathological extent. When she was a young teenager my grandmother would starve her and her sisters because we run big in our family, and ""a lady never weighs over 110"". She cut their hair, forced them to dye it blonde. She repeatedly told them that their job was to be a ""jewel on a man's arm"", and that was all they could ever hope to be. And so they are. My aunt is married to a wealthy man and dabbles in art, my other aunt is an escort, and my mother went through four marriages before she eventually killed herself. 

My mother was a brilliant woman. She was a talented artist, a voracious reader, but because of the way she was raised she never took herself seriously. When my brother and I were very young, she started nursing school. But one day, my then four or five year old older brother told her ""I need a mommy, not a nurse"". She quit that day. And It seems to me she also quit having any plans for herself, her life, other than wife and mother, and whatever affairs she could wrangle up on the side (which were a lot). Just as it said in the mystique, sex had become her function, her job, the only thing she was good at. My escort aunt took it to an extreme. My mother just let it slowly eat her. 

She wrote a couple of books that could have been published had she been willing to do the editing required. She got  a BA in art and could have gotten a Masters and become a teacher, but she just didn't want to make a commitment. She turned her attention to attracting the attention, at 56 or so, of a ..let's call him a minor celebrity. My mother did eventually seduce and befriend this minor celebrity. He dabbled with her, and then went on to marry a woman in her young thirties whom he could have children with. She obsessed about him for a couple of years and when she finally realized it was never to happen, and (I think) that she was going to get older and lose her looks, she shot herself. I know that isn't the whole reason but it is a lot of it. Her function was gone. Her self imposed reason for living was being taken away by the years and I guess she couldn't stand it. 

The worst part is even though she had a man in her life who did (and still does) love her without limit, but he was overweight, and only a waiter, and threfore"" wasn't good enough"" for him. She had to live trhough a successful man. Every man she had married was a ""successful"" man who hadn't loved her back. But this fat waiter loved her, the very heart of her, and she turned him away in favor of some ""status"" man she could never have - who would fulfill her own need for a self. It enrages and saddens me - on top of the sadness of having lost my mother I slowly start to realize I never had her in the first place - this cultural idea took her from me way before I was born. 

I even see these ideas in active in my own life and self-regard. I see how guilty I feel for not ""using"" my beauty, not starving myself, not ""being all I can be"". I see the ways in which everything I did was subtly to attract a man. I finally did, and I realized that I had nothing much inside but dreams. No real opinions, no real stances - just a vague notion of whatever interested me, whatever might best please who I was around. I'm working through that trying to find more of myself, as it were, but before I read this book it never occurred to me that what I was suffering was a cultural symptom, handed down, and that it contributed to my mom's death a lack of life. I think I have been, all my life, subconsciously accepting that as soon as I married and had children my life would be essentially over, and living in dread of, but having no real choice but than, follow my mother's morbid footsteps into the dark. It wasn't until I read this book till I realized how I grew up and what I have been denying myself, and why my mother died, and I have to stop now because frankly I'm going numb and I feel like I'm going to vomit. Thank you for listening.

I really must ask for your help - currently in Northern Ireland it is illegal for women to have an abortion (unless life threatening danger). HOWEVER because we have the unusual benefit of 'dual citizenship' in my country, anyone born here can claim to be both an Irish citizen, *and* a United Kingdom citizen, as our country is currently under UK government and law.

In Ireland, it is illegal to have an abortion, and recently the EU asked the UK in 2000 to update it's abortion laws (devised and sworn into law in 1967) to be in keeping with modern human rights laws. Yet when the UK Government proposed to our local government to embrace the law, only **four politicians spoke on behalf of our people, to tell them that we were a religious country, and that we would not welcome an extension of the law**.

I don't have to tell you how undemocratic that is.. but it gets worse. The United Kingdom has the HIGHEST teenage pregnancy rate in Europe, and in Northern Ireland, we have so many single mothers with serious social deprivation it's unreal. 

As we are legally capable of having abortions within the UK, but NOT on Northern Ireland soil, these women, often fighting severe pressure from both Doctors and otherwise (I've been in the room when escorting a friend - so I can speak from first hand experience) are forced to *fly* to the UK *and back* immediately after the procedure. That is, of course, IF they can afford it. Most can't.

Our schools do not teach appropriate sexual education, and as most of our social housing is 95% segregated, the majority of our youth go to single religion schools. 85% of our people would prefer this was **NOT** the case.. but our politicians are very much in the hands of their churches - **we don't get a voice.**

As a highly 'religious society', there is also rarely appropriate reports of sexual assault and rape. People are afraid to speak out on these topics, and many pressure groups from across the border in the Republic of Ireland attempt to influence our politics by having huge campaigns in our city centres to bludgeon us into apathy - so reaction groups are minimal and struggle to have people confident enough to march with them against this.

This week, the Maria Stopes Private abortion clinic has announced it will open in our city centre, circumventing the current law which only states that Northern Ireland based socialised medical health care cannot provide this. Up until now the amazing Family Planning Clinic in the UK has attempted to subsidise women's travelling expenses to have abortions, but these opportunities are few and far between and with the recession, they are even fewer. With a local clinic, potentially over [300 teenagers](http://www.fpa.org.uk/media/uploads/professionals/factsheets/northern-ireland-factsheets/northern-ireland-teenage-pregnancy.pdf) (recent drops in statistics are mostly recession influenced) will finally have the opportunity to turn their circumstances around.

I know our numbers are small, I know we're just one tiny country in the midst of this with only 1.8m or so population... but if you can spend two minutes to allow me to ask a simple favour of you;

Please go to our national paper, the [Belfast Telegraph's article on the recent protests against the Marie Stopes Clinic](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/belfast-marie-stopes-abortion-clinic-mass-protest-planned-16224917.html), about half way down, there is a small poll asking; ""Do you believe the Marie Stopes abortion clinic should have been allowed to open in Northern Ireland?"" - **Please vote YES**.
Currently the poll stands at 45% Yes and 55% No. 

If you'd like to take it one step further, you can also join the [Marie Stope Facebook Support Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/We-Fully-Support-the-Marie-Stopes-Clinic-in-Belfast/240689086056998) to help us also!

Today r/Feminisms, please, if your ethics allow it, stand with me and my country, please help us stop this madness and help the predecessors of the women I've seen suffer, not have to *ever* suffer again.

They are more likely to receive as well as give oral sex, to use a greater variety of sexual positions and to experience orgasm regularly.
Certainly, some guys are still threatened by a woman’s achievements. But scaring these types off might be a good thing. The men most likely to feel emotional and physical distress when their wives have a higher status or income tend to be those who are more invested in their identity as breadwinners than as partners and who define success in materialistic ways. Both these traits are associated with lower marital quality. Few women really want to marry a man whose penis rises and falls in tandem with the size of his paycheck or the prestige of his diploma.”

His reasoning is that he wants to market to ""good-looking"" people, and that having ""good-looking"" people in A&amp;F stores will attract other good looking people, while having ""unattractive"" people will dissuade the target customers from shopping there.  

Of course this is offensive and problematic.  Equating body shape/size with attractiveness is not okay.  Perpetuating body shame is not okay.  Marginalizing entire groups of people for the benefit of others or to make a profit is not okay.  He should be ashamed.  I'm honestly quite shocked that he had the gall to say that so bluntly and so publicly.  I am happy to see that this sort of statement is being met with such fierce indignance, and that we are not letting it slide.

But that's not actually want to talk about here.  I want to talk about the way in which people are responding.  Every single reaction I have come across so far has made some mention of how hypocritical it is for an ""ugly"" guy to have this kind of attitude.  Does nobody see how flawed that argument is?  That is body shaming TOO.  The fact that we think Jeffries is ugly is not only based on an arbitrary construction of what attractiveness is, but it has absolutely no bearing on how offensive his statement is.  If he had been a handsome, well-groomed, muscular guy, his statement would be just as offensive.  Rather than sinking to his level and further perpetuating and participating in this body-shaming culture, would we not do better to take a critical look at what is actually being said, rather than the person saying it?

TL;DR: If we are calling him out for body-shaming, while also calling him ugly, aren't we just as bad?",,False,,t5_2qhba,False,,,True,t3_1e08ca,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/1e08ca/my_thoughts_on_the_response_to_the_af_debacle/,

I did a quick search on what other people were saying and found these two articles one give the movie a B+ and the other an F for being feminist friendly.
