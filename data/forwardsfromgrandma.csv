HOW MOSES GOT THE 10 COMMANDMENTS

&gt;&gt; God went to the Arabs and said,
&gt;&gt; 'I have Commandments for you that will make your lives better.'
&gt;&gt; The Arabs asked, 'What are Commandments?'
&gt;&gt; And the Lord said, 'They are rules for living.'
&gt;&gt; 'Can you give us an example?'
&gt;&gt; 'Thou shall not kill.'
&gt;&gt; 'Not kill? We're not interested..'
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So He went to the Blacks and said, 'I have Commandments.'
&gt;&gt; The Blacks wanted an example, and the Lord said,
&gt;&gt; 'Honour thy Father and Mother.'
&gt;&gt; 'Father? We don't know who our fathers are.
&gt;&gt; We're not interested.'
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Then He went to the Mexicans and said,
&gt;&gt; 'I have Commandments.'
&gt;&gt; The Mexicans also wanted an example, and the Lord said
&gt;&gt; 'Thou shall not steal.'
&gt;&gt; 'Not steal? We're not interested.'
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Then He went to the French and said,
&gt;&gt; 'I have Commandments.'
&gt;&gt; The French too wanted an example and the Lord said, 'Thou
&gt;&gt; shall not commit adultery.'
&gt;&gt; 'Sacre bleu!!! Not commit adultery? We're not interested.'
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Finally, He went to the Jews and said,
&gt;&gt;  I have Commandments..'
&gt;&gt; 'Commandments?' They said, 'How much are they?'
&gt;&gt; 'They're free.'
&gt;&gt; 'We'll take 10.'
&gt;&gt;

When Bill and Hillary first got married Bill said, ""I am putting a box under the bed. You must promise never to look in it.""

In all their 30 years of marriage, Hillary never looked. On the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In the box were 3 empty beer cans and $81,874.25 in cash.

She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there even was such a box with such contents. That evening, they were out for a special anniversary dinner.

After dinner, Hillary could no longer  contain  her curiosity and she confessed, saying, ""I am so sorry, Bill. For all these years, I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know, why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?""

Bill thought for a while and said, ""I guess after all these years you
deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you, I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.""

Hillary was shocked, but said, ""Hmmm, Jennifer, Paula and Monica. I am
very disappointed and saddened by your behavior. However, since you are
addicted to sex I guess it does happen and I guess 3 times is not that
bad considering your problem.""

Bill thanked her for being so understanding. They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Hillary asked Bill, ""So why do you
have all that money in the box?""

**Bill answered: ""Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the recycling center and redeemed them for cash.""**",,False,self,t5_2t776,False,,angrygranny,True,t3_1a1std,http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/1a1std/fw_bill_hillary/,

He was stiff-legged and walking slowly.

One student said to his friend:
""I'm sure that poor old man has Peltry Syndrome.
Those people walk just like that.""

The other student says:
""No, I don't think so. The old man surely has Zovitzki Syndrome.
He walks slowly and his legs are apart, just as we learned in class.""

Since they couldn't agree they decided to ask the old man. They approached him and one of the students said to him,
""We're medical students and couldn't help
but notice the way you walk, but we couldn't agree on the syndrome you might have.
Could you tell us what it is?""

The old man said,
""I'll tell you, but first you tell me what you two fine medical students think.""

The first student said, ""I think it's Peltry Syndrome.""

The old man said, ""You thought - but you are wrong.""


The other student said, ""I think you have Zovitzki Syndrome.""

The old man said, ""You thought - but you are wrong.""


So they asked him, ""Well, old timer, what do you have?""

Last week, we took some friends to a new restaurant, 'Steve's Place,' and noticed that the waiter who took our order carried a spoon in his shirt pocket. 

It seemed a little strange.

When the busboy brought our water and utensils, I observed that he also had a spoon in his shirt pocket. 

Then I looked around and saw that all the staff had spoons in their pockets. When the waiter came back to serve our soup I inquired, ""Why the spoon?"" 

""Well,"" he explained, ""the restaurant's owner hired Accenture Consulting to revamp all of our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our personnel are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift.""

As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he replaced it with his spare. ""I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now."" I was impressed. 

I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's fly.

Looking around, I saw that all of the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So, before he walked off, I asked the waiter, ""Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?""

""Oh, certainly,"" Then he lowered his voice. ""Not everyone is so observant.

""That consulting firm I mentioned also learned that we can save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the tip of our you-know-what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 76.39%.""

I asked quietly, ""After you get it out, how do you put it back?""

""Well,"" he whispered, ""I don't know about the others, but I use the spoon.""",,False,self,t5_2t776,False,,,True,t3_143wsa,http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/143wsa/the_spoon/,

I went downstairs for breakfast, hoping my wife would be pleasant and say,  “Happy Birthday!”, 
and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone,  “Happy Birthday.”  I thought, Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... they'll remember.

My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I was feeling pretty low and somewhat despondent.

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, ""Good Morning Boss"",  and by the way ""Happy Birthday!""  I felt a little better... at least someone had remembered.

I buried myself in work, and it was after one o'clock when Jane knocked and opened my door. When I looked up, she said with a big smile,  ""You know Boss, It's such a nice day outside, and it is your birthday... what do you say I take you out to lunch, just you and me, my treat.""   I said,  ""Why thank you Jane, that has to be the best thing I've heard all day, let's go!""

We didn't go to the busy deli where I usually go to grab a quick lunch. She chose instead a quiet little dimly lit bistro, with a private table. She ordered us martinis, and we spent the next couple of hours drinking, talking, and enjoying a fine meal, not to mention each others company. It was turning out to be one of the best birthdays I could remember! On the way back to the office, Jane said,  ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... we don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?""   I responded,  ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""   She said,  ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""

After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said,  ""Boss, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment... I'll be right back.""   ""OK.""  I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a few minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake, with lit candles. Following her were my wife, my kids, my co-workers, and several of my closest friends, all singing  ""Happy Birthday"".

Horrified, Katie told her grandmother that 2 people nearly 100 years old having sex would surely be asking for trouble. ""Oh no, my dear,"" replied granny. ""Many years ago, realizing our advanced age, we figured out the best time to do it was when the church bells would start to ring. It was just the right rhythm. Nice and slow and even. Nothing too strenuous, simply in on the Ding and out on the Dong."" She paused to wipe away a tear, and continued, ""He'd still be alive if the ice cream truck hadn't come along.""

Kevin's mates are very upset that he can't go, but what can they do.

Two days later the three mates get to the camping site only to find Kevin sitting there with a tent set up, firewood gathered, and dinner cooking on the fire.
""Shit ,Kevin how long you been here? How did you talk your missus into letting you go ?""

""Well, I've been here since last night. After dinner at home yesterday evening, I was sitting in my chair and my wife came up behind me and put her hands over my eyes and said, 'Guess who ?'""
I pulled her hands off, and she was wearing sexy brand new lingerie. She said had been reading 'Fifty Shades of Grey' and she had a devilish look in her eyes!!!
She took my hand and led me to our bedroom. The room had candles and rose petals all over.
On the bed she had handcuffs, and ropes !
She told me to tie her up and cuff her to the bed, so I did.

This is fun. I promise you WILL laugh when you find the identity of your role model.

NO CHEATING! I was really surprised to find out the name of my role model. Don't scroll down yet....

To find the identity of your personal role model, do the math below…
Then scroll down to find your hero.
It is crazy how accurate this is!



NO PEEKING!

1.) Pick your favorite number between 1-9
2.) Multiply by 3
3.) Add 3
4.) Then again multiply by 3, I'll wait if you need a calculator
5.) You'll get a 2 or 3 digit number
6.) Add the digits together


NOW SCROLL DOWN




And with that number, see who your ROLE MODEL is from the list below:

1. Einstein
2. Queen Elizabeth
3. Abe Lincoln
4. Bill Clinton
5. Bill Gates
6. Gandhi
7. Barack Obama
8. Winston Churchill
9.  Grandma!
10. Jackie Kennedy


I know, I know.... I just have that effect on people.

P.S. Stop picking different numbers!

A filthy rich Florida man decided that he wanted to throw a party and
invite all of his buddies and neighbors.

He also invited Leroy, the only Redneck in the neighborhood.
He held the party around the pool in the back yard of his mansion.

Leroy was having a good time drinking, dancing, eating shrimp, oysters
and BBQ and flirting with all the women.

At the height of the party, the host said, “I have a 10-foot
man-eating gator in my pool, and I'll give a million dollars to anyone
who has the nerve to jump in.”

The words were barely out of his mouth when there was a loud splash.
Everyone turned around and saw Leroy in the pool.

Leroy was fighting the gator and kicking its rear.  Leroy was jabbing
it in the eyes with his thumbs, throwing punches, head butts and choke
holds, biting the gator on the tail and flipping it through the air
like some kind of Judo Instructor.

The water was churning and splashing everywhere. Both Leroy and the
gator were screaming and raising hell.

Finally Leroy strangled the gator and let it float to the top like a
dime store goldfish.

Leroy then slowly climbed out of the pool.  Everybody was just staring
at him in disbelief.

Finally the host says, “Well, Leroy, I reckon I owe you a million dollars.”

“No, that's okay. I don't want it,” said Leroy

The rich man said, “Man, I have to give you something you won the bet.
How about half a million bucks then?”

“No thanks, I don't want it,” answered Leroy.

The host said, “Come on, I insist on giving you something. That was
amazing. How about a new Porsche and a Rolex and some stock options?”

Again Leroy said no.

Confused, the rich man asked, “Well, Leroy, then what do you want?”

Leroy said, “I want the name of the Sumbich who pushed me in the pool!”",,False,self,t5_2t776,False,,,True,t3_1gipoe,http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/1gipoe/sumbich/,

I asked for a half dozen nuggets.
'We don't have half dozen nuggets,' said the

'You don't?' I replied.
'We only have six, nine, or twelve,' was the reply.
'So I can't order a half dozen nuggets, but I can order six?'
'That's right.'
So I shook my head and ordered six McNuggets

I was checking out at the local Wal-Mart with just a few items and the lady behind me put her things on the belt close to mine. I picked up one of those 'dividers' that they keep by the cash register and placed it between our things so they wouldn't get mixed. 
After the girl had scanned all of my items, she picked up the
'divider', looking it all over for the bar code so she could scan it.
Not finding the bar code, she said to me, 'Do you know how much this is?'
I said to her 'I've changed my mind; I don't think I'll buy that today.'
She said 'OK,' and I paid her for the things and left.
She had no clue to what had just happened.

( But the lady behind me had a big smirk on her face as I left)

A woman at work was seen putting a credit card into her floppy drive and pulling it out very quickly.
When I inquired as to what she was doing, she said she was shopping on the Internet and they kept asking for a credit card number, so she was using the ATM 'thingy.'

I recently saw a distraught young lady weeping beside her car. 'Do you need some help?' I asked. She replied, 'I knew I should have replaced the battery to this remote door unlocker. Now I can't get into my car. Do you think they (pointing to a distant convenience store) would have a battery to fit this?'
'Hmmm, I don't know. Do you have an alarm, too?' I asked.
'No, just this remote thingy,' she answered,
handing it and the car keys to me. As I
took the key and manually unlocked the door, I
replied, 'Why don't you drive over there and
check about the batteries. It's a long walk....'

PLEASE just lay down before you hurt yourself !!!

Several years ago, we had an Intern who was none too swift. One day she was typing and turned to a secretary and said, 'I'm almost out of typing paper. What do I do?' 'Just use paper from the photocopier', the secretary told her. With that, the intern took her last remaining blank piece of paper, put it on the photocopier and proceeded to make five 'blank' copies.

Brunette, by the way!!

A mother calls 911 very worried asking the dispatcher if she needs to take her kid to the emergency room, the kid had eaten ants. The dispatcher tells her to give the kid some Benadryl and he should be fine, the mother says, 'I just gave him some ant killer......'

An atheist was walking through the woods.

'What majestic trees!'
'What powerful rivers!'
'What beautiful animals!'
He said to himself.


As he was walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him.


He turned to look. He saw a 7-foot grizzly bear charge towards him. 

He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder &amp; saw that the bear was closing in on him.

He looked over his shoulder again, &amp; the bear was even closer.


He tripped &amp; fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up but saw that the bear was right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw &amp; raising his right paw to strike him.
 


At that instant moment, the Atheist cried out: 
'Oh my God!'

Time stopped.
The bear froze.
The forest was silent.

As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky.

'You deny my existence for all these years, teach others I don't exist and even credit creation to cosmic accident.' 'Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament?'

'Am I to count you as a believer?'

The atheist looked directly into the light, and said: 'It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask you to treat me as a Christian now, but perhaps you could make the BEAR a Christian?'

'Very well,' said the voice.

The light went out. The sounds of the forest resumed. And the bear dropped his right paw, brought both paws together, bowed his head &amp; spoke:

They were tied up, led to the village and brought before the chief. The chief said, ""I am familiar with your Western custom of granting the condemned a last wish. Before we kill and eat you, do you have any last requests?""

Dan Rather said, ""Well, I'm a Texan; so I'd like one last bowlful of hot, spicy chili."" The chief nodded to an underling, who left and returned with the chili. Rather ate it all and said, ""Now I can die content.""

Jesse Jackson said, ""You know, the thing in this life I am proudest of is my work on behalf of the poor and oppressed. So before I go, I want to sing ""We Shall Overcome"" one last time."" The chief said, ""Go right ahead, we're listening."" Jackson sang the song, and then said, ""Now I can die in peace.""

Cokie Roberts said, ""I'm a reporter to the end. I want to take out my tape recorder and describe the scene here and what's about to happen. Maybe someday someone will hear it and know that I was on the job til the end."" The chief directed an aide to hand over the tape recorder, and Roberts dictated some comments. She then said, ""Now I can die happy.""

The chief turned and said, ""And now, Mr. Marine, what is your final wish?""

""Kick me in the ass,"" said the Marine.

""What?"" said the chief. ""Will you mock us in your last hour?""

""No, I'm not kidding. I want you to kick me in the ass,"" insisted the Marine.

So the chief shoved him into the open, and kicked him in the ass. The Marine went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9mm pistol from his waistband, and shot the chief dead. In the resulting confusion, he leapt to his knapsack, pulled out his M4 carbine, and sprayed the cannibals with gunfire. In a flash, the cannibals were dead or fleeing for their lives.

As the Marine was untying the others, they asked him, ""Why didn't you just shoot them? Why did you ask them to kick you in the ass?""

A young man working in the army was constantly humiliated because he believed in God.
One day the captain decided to humiliate him before the troops. He called the young man and said:

- Youn
g man, take the key and go and park the Jeep in front.
The young man replied:
- I can not drive!
The captain said:
- But then ask your assistance from God! Shows us that He exists!
The young man took the key and walked to the vehicle, praying the whole time.

...As a result he parked the Jeep to the place PERFECTLY well as the captain wanted.
The young man came out of the jeep and saw them all crying. They all said together:
- We want to serve your God!
The young soldier was astonished, he wanted to know what was going on?
CAPTAIN was crying, and he opened the hood of the jeep showing the young man that the car had no engine.

Then the boy said:

See? This is the God I serve, the God who gives life to what does not exist. You may think there are things that still impossible.
THIS GOD OF IMPOSSIBILITY WILL BE YOUR GOD TODAY!

You definitely need to read the statement by Jay. Oh so true.

Those of You Born 
1930 - 1979
 

At the end of this email is a quote of the month by Jay Leno. If you don't read anything else, please read what he said.  Very well stated, Mr. Leno. 
TO ALL THE KIDS WHO SURVIVED THE 
1930's, 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's!
 

First, we survived being born to mothers who smoked and/or drank while they were pregnant.
 

They took aspirin, ate blue cheese dressing, tuna from a can and didn't get tested for diabetes.
 

Then after that trauma, we were put to sleep on our tummies in baby cribs covered with bright colored lead-base paints.
 

We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, locks on doors or cabinets and when we rode our bikes, we had baseball caps not helmets on our heads.
 

As infants &amp; children, we would ride in cars with no car seats, no booster seats, no seat belts, no air bags, bald tires and sometimes no brakes.
 

Riding in the back of a pick-up truck on a warm day was always a special treat. 

We drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle. 


We shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle and no one actually died from this. 


We ate cupcakes, white bread, real butter and bacon.  We drank Kool-Aid made with real white sugar.  And, we weren't overweight. 
WHY? 


Because we were always outside playing...that's why! 


We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the streetlights came on. 


No one was able to reach us all day. And, we were O.K. 


We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps. And then ride them down the hill, only to find out We forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem.


We did not have Playstations, Nintendo's and X-boxes.  There were no video games, no 150 channels on cable,  no video movies or DVD's, no surround-sound or CD's,  no cell phones, no personal computers, no Internet and no chat rooms. WE HAD FRIENDS and we went outside and found them! 


We fell out of trees, got cut, broke bones and teeth and there were no lawsuits from these accidents. 


We ate worms and mud pies made from dirt, and the worms did not live in us forever. 


We were given BB guns for our 10th birthdays, made up games with sticks and tennis balls and, although we were told it would happen, we did not put out very many eyes. 


We rode bikes or walked to a friend'shouse and 
knocked on the door or rang the bell, or just 
walked in and talked to them. 


Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who didn't had to learn to deal with disappointment.  Imagine that!! 


The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law was unheard of.  They actually sided with the law! 


These generations have produced some of the best risk-takers, problem solvers and inventors ever. 


The past 50 years Have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all. 


If YOU are one of them? CONGRATULATIONS!
You might want to share this with others who have had the luck to grow up as kids, before the 
lawyers and the government regulated so much of our lives for our own good. 


While you are at it, forward it to your kids so they will know how brave and lucky their parents were. 


Kind of makes you want to run through the house with scissors, doesn't it ? 


The quote of the month is by Jay Leno:
""With hurricanes, tornados, fires out of control, mud slides, flooding, severe thunderstorms 
tearing up the country from one end to another, 
and with the threat of swine flu and terrorist attacks.  Are we sure this is a good time to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance?'


For those that prefer to think that God is not watching over us.. ..go ahead and delete this. 


For the rest of us...pass this on. 
A Small Prayer! 


God determines who walks into your life.....it's up to you to decide who you let walk away, who you let stay, and who you refuse to let go. 


I need this back. If you'll do this for me, I'll do it for you. 


When there is nothing left but God, that is when you find out that God is all you need. Take 60 seconds and give this a shot! All you do is simply say the following small prayer for the person who sent you this. 


Father, 
God bless my friend in whatever it is that You know they may need this day!
And may their life be full of your peace, prosperity, and power as he/she seeks to have a closer relationship with you. 
Amen. 


Then send it on to five other people, including the one who sent it to you Within hours you will have caused a multitude of people to pray for other people. Then sit back and watch the power of God work in your life. 

P. S.... Five is good, but more is better.

A man died and went to heaven. As he stood in front of St. Peter at the Pearly Gates, he saw a huge wall of clocks behind him.

He asked, 'What are all those clocks?'

St. Peter answered, 'Those are Lie-Clocks.
Everyone on Earth has a Lie-Clock.

Every time you lie the hands on your clock will move.'

'Oh,' said the man, 'whose clock is that?'

'That's Mother Teresa's. The hands have never moved, indicating that she never told a lie.'

'Incredible,' said the man. 'And whose clock is that one?'

St. Peter responded, 'That's Abraham Lincoln's clock. The hands have moved twice, telling us that Abe told only two lies in his entire life.'

'Where's President Obama's clock?' asked the man.

Obama's clock is in Jesus' office.

Several days after President Obama was reelected president, he went over to see Bill and Hillary Clinton for dinner at their spacious home.

After drinking several glasses of iced tea, he asked his host if he could use his personal bathroom.

When he entered Bill Clinton 's private toilet, he was astonished to see that Clinton had a golden urinal! Wow!

The next day, Obama told his wife, Michelle, about the urinal in Clinton's private lavatory. ""Just think,' he said, 'maybe I should get a gold urinal too. But on the other hand I think that it may be just a bit too self-indulgent... Even for a guy like me!""

Later in the week, when Michelle had lunch with Hillary, she told Hillary how impressed her husband had been at his discovering that Bill had a gold urinal in his private bathroom.

Later that day, when Bill got home, Hillary smiled and said to Bill: ""I found out who pissed in your saxophone.""",,False,self,t5_2t776,False,,,True,t3_187p6n,http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/187p6n/fw_golden_urinal/,

AMAZING, SIMPLE HOME REMEDIES:

1.  AVOID CUTTING YOURSELF WHEN SLICING VEGETABLES BY GETTING SOMEONE ELSE TO HOLD THE VEGETABLES WHILE YOU CHOP.

2.  AVOID ARGUMENTS WITH THE FEMALES ABOUT LIFTING THE TOILET SEAT BY USING THE SINK.

3.  FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE SUFFERERS ~ SIMPLY CUT YOURSELF AND BLEED FOR A FEW MINUTES, THUS REDUCING THE PRESSURE ON YOUR VEINS.  REMEMBER TO SET A TIMER.

4.  A MOUSE TRAP PLACED ON TOP OF YOUR ALARM CLOCK WILL PREVENT YOU FROM ROLLING OVER AND GOING BACK TO SLEEP AFTER YOU HIT THE SNOOZE BUTTON.

5.  IF YOU HAVE A BAD COUGH, TAKE A LARGE DOSE OF LAXATIVES; THEN YOU'LL BE AFRAID TO COUGH.

6.  YOU NEED ONLY TWO TOOLS IN LIFE - WD-40 AND DUCT TAPE.  IF IT DOESN'T MOVE AND SHOULD, USE THE WD-40.  IF IT SHOULDN'T MOVE AND DOES, USE THE DUCT TAPE.

7.  IF YOU CAN'T FIX IT WITH A HAMMER, YOU'VE GOT AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM.

.
 Yesterday I was at my local Kroger buying a large bag of Purina dog chow for my loyal pet, Jake, the Wonder Dog and was in the check-out line when a woman behind me asked if I had a dog.
What did she think I had an elephant?
So because I'm retired and have little to do, on impulse I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, I was starting the Purina Diet again. I added that I probably shouldn't, because I ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.
I told her that it was essentially a Perfect Diet and that the way that it works is, to load your pants pockets with Purina Nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so it works well and I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in line was now enthralled with my story.)
Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care, because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no, I stopped to Pee on a Fire Hydrant and a car hit me.
I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was Laughing so hard.
 
Kroger won't let me shop there anymore. Better watch what you ask retired people. They have all the time in the World to think of crazy things to say. Forward this (especially) to all your retired friends...it will be their laugh for the day!

This is an actual job application that a 75-year-old pensioner submitted to B&amp;Q in Tunbridge Wells

They hired him because he was so funny..... This is a genuine application form for a position at B&amp;Q. Wouldn't you just love to!!!...............

NAME: Kenneth Way (Grumpy Bastard)

SEX: Not lately, but I am looking for the right woman (or at least one who will cooperate)

DESIRED POSITION:
Company's Chief Executive or Managing Director. But seriously, whatever's available.
If I was in a position to be picky, I wouldn't be applying in the first place - would I?

DESIRED SALARY:
£150,000 a year plus share options and a Tony Blair style redundancy package.
If that's not possible, make an offer and we can haggle.

EDUCATION:
Yes.

LAST POSITION HELD:
Target for middle management hostility.

PREVIOUS SALARY:
A lot less than I'm worth.

MOST NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENT:
My incredible collection of stolen pens and post-it notes.

REASON FOR LEAVING LAST POSITION:
It was a crap job.

HOURS AVAILABLE TO WORK:
Any.

PREFERRED HOURS: 1:30-3:30 p.m. Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.

DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIAL SKILLS?:
Yes, but they're better suited to a more intimate environment.

MAY WE CONTACT YOUR CURRENT EMPLOYER?:
If I had one, would I be here?

DO YOU HAVE ANY PHYSICAL CONDITIONS THAT WOULD PROHIBIT YOU FROM LIFTING UP TO 50 lbs.?:
Of what?

DO YOU HAVE A CAR?:
I think the more appropriate question here would be 'Do you have a car that runs?'

HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY SPECIAL AWARDS OR RECOGNITION?:
I may already be a winner of the Reader'sDigest Timeshare Free Holiday Offer, so they tell me.

DO YOU SMOKE?:
On the job - no! On my breaks - yes!

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE DOING IN FIVE YEARS?:
Living in the Bahamas with a fabulously wealthy Swedish supermodel with big tits and who thinks I'm the greatest thing since sliced bread. Actually, I'd like to be doing that now.

NEAREST RELATIVE?:
7 miles away

DO YOU CERTIFY THAT THE ABOVE IS TRUE AND COMPLETE TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE?:
Oh Yes, Absolutely.",,False,self,t5_2t776,False,,angrygranny,True,t3_15lcen,http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/15lcen/rerefwrefw_best_job_application_ever/,

Beer contains female hormones! Yes, that's right, FEMALE hormones. Last month, Montreal University and scientists released the results of a recent analysis that revealed the presence of female hormones in beer.

Men should take a concerned look at their beer consumption. The theory is that beer contains female hormones (hops contain Phytoestrogens) and that by drinking enough beer, men turn into women.

To test the theory, 100 men each drank 8 schooners of beer within a one hour period. It was then observed that 100% of the test subjects, yes, 100% of all these men:

**1)** Argued over nothing.

**2)** Refused to apologize when obviously wrong.

**3)** Gained weight.

**4)** Talked excessively without making sense.

**5)** Became overly emotional

**6)** Couldn't drive.

**7)** Failed to think rationally.

**8)** Had to sit down while urinating.

Putin's Speech on Feb. 04, 2013

Fat chance, but this is one time our elected leaders should pay attention to
the advice of Vladimir Putin....how scary is that?
 

&gt; On February 4th, 2013, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, addressed the
&gt; Duma, (Russian Parliament), and gave a speech about the tensions with
&gt; minorities in Russia:  ""In Russia live Russians. Any minority, from
&gt; anywhere, if it wants to live in Russia, to work and eat in Russia, should
&gt; speak Russian, and should respect the Russian laws. If they prefer Sharia
&gt; Law, then we advise them to go to those places where that's the state law.
&gt; Russia does not need minorities. Minorities need Russia, and we will not
&gt; grant them special privileges, or try to change our laws to fit their
&gt; desires, no matter how loud they yell 'discrimination'. We better learn from
&gt; the suicides of America, England, Holland and France, if we are to survive
&gt; as a nation. The Russian customs and traditions are not compatible with the
&gt; lack of culture or the primitive ways of most minorities. When this
&gt; honorable legislative body thinks of creating new laws, it should have in
&gt; mind the national interest first, observing that the minorities are not
&gt; Russians.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The politicians in the Duma gave Putin a standing ovation for five minutes.

  According to Anderson Consulting Worldwide, around 90%  of the  
 Professionals  they tested got all questions wrong, but many  preschoolers got several correct answers.   Anderson Consulting says this conclusively proves the theory that most professionals do not have the brains of a  four-year-old.

One afternoon they were working in the garden together.

As the wife was bending over pulling weeds, the husband said, ""Hey honey, you're getting fat. Your butt is getting huge. I bet it's as big as the gas grill now.""

The husband, feeling he needed to prove his point, got a yard stick, measured the grill and then measured his wife's butt.

""Yep"", he said, ""Just as I thought; just about the same size.""

The wife got very angry and decided to let him do the gardening alone. She went inside and didn't speak to her husband the rest of the day.

That evening when they went to bed, the husband cuddled up to his wife and said, ""How about it honey? How about a little lovemaking?""

The wife rolled over and turned her back to him, giving him the cold shoulder.

""What's the matter?"" he asked.

of Alaska. He was cruising along the campground in the 'Popemobile' 
when he heard a frantic commotion just at the edge of the woods. He 
found a helpless Democrat wearing shorts, sandals, a Vote for Obama 
hat and a Save the Trees shirt. The man was screaming and struggling 
frantically, thrashing all about and trying to free himself from the 
grasp of a 10-foot grizzly bear. 
  
As the Pope watched in horror, a group of Republican loggers wearing 
Go Sarah shirts came racing up. One quickly fired a .44 magnum slug 
right into the bear's chest. The two other men pulled the 
semiconscious Democrat from the bear's grasp. Then using baseball 
bats, the three loggers finished off the bear. Two of the men dragged 
the dead grizzly onto the bed of their pickup truck while the other 
tenderly placed the injured Democrat in the back seat. 

As they began to leave, the Pope summoned all of them over to him. ""I 
give you my blessing for your brave actions!"" he proudly proclaimed. 
""I have heard there was bitter hatred between Republican loggers and 
Democratic environmental activists, but now I've seen with my own eyes 
that this is not true.""
As the Pope drove off, one logger asked his buddies, ""Who was 
that guy ?""
""Dude, that was the Pope,"" another replied. ""He's in direct contact 
with Heaven and has access to all kinds of wisdom."" 
 
""Well,"" the logger said, ""he may have a lot of wisdom, but he 
doesn't know anything about bear hunting!  By the way, is our bait still

A Muslim man in Egypt killed his
wife because she was reading the
Bible and then buried her with
their infant baby and an 8-year
...
old daughter. The girls were
buried alive! He then reported to
the police that an uncle killed the
kids. 15 days later, another family
member died.

When they went to
bury him, they found the 2 little
girls under the sand -ALIVE! The
country is outraged over the
incident, and the man will be
executed..
The older girl was
asked how she had survived and
she says:-'A man wearing shiny
white clothes, with bleeding
wounds in his hands, came every
day to feed us.

He woke up my
mom so she could nurse my
sister,' she said. She was
interviewed on Egyptian national
TV, by availed Muslim woman
news anchor.

She said on public
TV, 'This was none other than
Jesus, because nobody else does
things like this!' Muslims believe
Isa (Jesus) would do this, but the
wounds mean He really was
crucified, and it's clear also that
He is alive! But, it's also clear that
the child could not make up a
story like this, and there is no way
these children could have survived
without a true miracle.


Muslim leaders are going to have a hard
time to figure out what to do with
this, and the popularity of the
Passion movie doesn't help! With
Egypt at the centre of the media
and education in the Middle East ,
you can be sure this story will
spread.

A Mom visits her son for dinner who lives with a girl roommate.
During the course of the meal, his mother couldn't help but notice how pretty his roommate was.She had long been suspicious of a
relationship between the two, and this had only made her more curious....

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and
his roommate than met the eye.
Reading his mom's thoughts, his son volunteered,
“I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you,we are just
roommates.""

About a week later, his roommate came to him saying,
“Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?""

He said ,""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just
to be sure."" He sat down and wrote :

Dear Mother:
I'm not saying that you ‘did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you ‘did not' take the silver plate But the fact
remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.

Love,
your son.

Several days later, he received an email from
his Mother which read:

Dear Son:
I'm not saying that you ‘do' sleep with your roommate, and
I'm not saying that you ‘do not' sleep with her.
But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she
would have found the silver plate by now, under her pillow…

In the year 2013, the Lord came unto Noah, Who was now living in America and said:
""Once again, the earth has become wicked and over-populated, and I see the end of all flesh before me.""
""Build another Ark and save 2 of every living thing along with a few good humans.""

He gave Noah the blueprints, saying:
""You have 6 months to build the Ark before I will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights.""

Six months later, the Lord looked down and saw Noah weeping in his yard - but no Ark.""Noah!,"" He roared, ""I'm about to start the rain! Where is the Ark?""

""Forgive me, Lord,"" begged Noah, ""but things have changed.""
""I needed a Building Permit.""
""I've been arguing with the Boat Inspector about the need for a sprinkler system.""

""My homeowners association claim that I've violated the
Neighborhood by-laws by building the Ark in my back yard and exceeding the height limitations. We had to go to the local Planning Committee for a decision.""

""Then the City Council and the Electricity Company demanded a shed load of money for the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstructions, to clear the passage for the Ark's move to the sea. I told them that the sea would be coming to us, but they would hear none of it.""

""Getting the wood was another problem. There's a ban on cutting local trees in order to save the Greater Spotted Barn Owl.""
""I tried to convince the environmentalists that I needed the wood to save the owls - but no go!""

""When I started gathering the animals, PETA took me to court. They insisted that I was confining wild animals against their will. They argued the accommodations were too restrictive and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space.""

""Then the Environmental Protection Agency ruled that I couldn't build the Ark until they'd conducted an environmental impact study on Your proposed flood.""

""I'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on how many minorities I'm supposed to hire for my building crew.""

""The Immigration Dept. Is checking the visa status of most of the people who want to work.""
""The labor unions say I can't use my sons. They insist I have to hire only union workers with ark-building experience.""

""To make matters worse, the IRS seized all my assets, claiming I'm trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species.""
""So, forgive me, Lord, but it would take at least 10 years for me to finish this ark.""

""Suddenly the skies cleared, the sun began to shine and a rainbow stretched across the sky.""

Noah looked up in wonder and asked, ""You mean you're not going to destroy the world?""

***

An atheist was seated next to a little girl on an airplane and he  
 turned to her and said,

 ""Do you want to talk? Flights go quicker if you strike up a  
 conversation with your fellow passenger.""

 The little girl, who had just started to read her book, replied to  
 the total stranger, ""What would you want to talk about?""

 ""Oh, I don't know,"" said the atheist. ""How about why there is no  
 God, or no Heaven or Hell, or no life after death?"" as he smiled  
 smugly.

 ""OK,"" she said. ""Those could be interesting topics. But let me ask  
 you a question first.

 A horse, a cow, and a Deer all eat the same stuff - grass.

 Yet a deer excretes Little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat  
 patty, but a
 Horse produces clumps. Why do you suppose that is?

 The atheist, visibly surprised by the little girl's intelligence,  
 thinks about it and says, ""Hmmm, I have no idea.""

 To which the little girl replies, ""Do you really feel qualified to  
 discuss why there is no God, or no Heaven
 Or Hell, or no life after death, when you don't know shit?""

 And then she went back to reading her book.

        It only makes sense, and would probably curtail generations of welfare recipients taking unfair advantage
 of the system that was put in place to temporarily help those who are going through an unexpected rough 
time making ends meet.

the best.

        This was written by a 21-yr-old female who gets it. It's her future she's worried about and this is how 
she feels about the social welfare big government state that she's being forced to live in! These solutions are 
just common sense in her opinion. 

        This was in the Waco Tribune Herald, Waco, TX.

        PUT ME IN CHARGE.

        Put me in charge of food stamps. I'd get rid of Lone Star cards; no cash for Ding Dongs or Ho Ho's, 
just money for 50-pound bags of rice and beans, blocks of cheese and all the powdered milk you can haul 
away. If you want steak and frozen pizza, then get a job. 

        Put me in charge of Medicaid. The first thing I'd do is to get women Norplant birth control implants or 
tubal ligations. Then, we'll test recipients for drugs, alcohol, and nicotine. If you want to reproduce or use 
drugs, alcohol, or smoke, then get a job. 

        Put me in charge of government housing. Ever live in a military barracks? You will maintain our property 
in a clean and good state of repair. Your home will be subject to inspections anytime and possessions will 
be inventoried. If you want a plasma TV or Xbox 360, then get a job and your own place. 

        In addition, you will either present a check stub from a job each week or you will report to a ""government"" 
job. It may be cleaning the roadways of trash, painting and repairing public housing, whatever we find for you. 
We will sell your 22-inch rims and low profile tires and your blasting stereo and speakers and put that money 
toward the ""common good."" 

        Before you write that I've violated someone's rights, realize that all of the above is voluntary. If you want
 our money, accept our rules. Before you say that this would be ""demeaning"" and ruin their ""self esteem,"" 
consider that it wasn't that long ago that taking someone else's money for doing absolutely nothing was 
demeaning and lowered self esteem. 

        If we are expected to pay for other people's mistakes we should at least attempt to make them learn 
from their bad choices. The current system rewards them for continuing to make bad choices.

        AND While you are on Gov't subsistence, you no longer can VOTE! Yes, that is correct. For you to vote 
would be a conflict of interest. You will voluntarily remove yourself from voting while you are receiving a 
Gov't welfare check. If you want to vote, then get a job. 
        IN ""GOD"" I TRUST!

The Central High graduate fumbled through his pockets and pulled out a lighter. He flicked it on. 'It's a candle', he said.

'You may pass through the pearly gates' Saint Peter said. 
The Tech High graduate reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys. He shook them and said, 'They're bells.'

Saint Peter said 'You may pass through the pearly gates'.

The South Side High graduate started searching desperately through his pockets and finally pulled out a pair of women's panties.

A carrot, an egg, and a cup of coffee...You will never look at a cup of coffee the same way again. 
A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved, a new one arose. 
Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to boil. In the first she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil; without saying a word. 

In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. 

Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, ""Tell me what you see."" 

""Carrots, eggs, and coffee,"" she replied. 

Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. 

Finally, the mother asked the daughter to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma the daughter then asked, ""What does it mean, mother?"" 

Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity: boiling water. Each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior, but after sitting through the boiling water, its insides became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water, they had changed the water. 
""Which are you?"" she asked her daughter. ""When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean? 

Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? 

Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after a death, a breakup, a financial hardship or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and hardened heart? 

Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. When the hour is the darkest and trials are their greatest, do you elevate yourself to another level? How do you handle adversity? Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean? 

May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human and enough hope to make you happy. 

The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the best of everything that comes along their way. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past; you can't go forward in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches. 

When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. 

Live your life so at the end, you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.

A SPANISH Teacher was explaining  to her class that in Spanish, unlike English, nouns are designated as either masculine or feminine.

'House' for instance, is feminine:  'la casa.'

'Pencil,' however, is masculine: 'el lapiz.'

A  student asked, 'What gender is 'computer'?'  
 
Instead of giving the answer, the teacher split the class into two groups, male and  female, and asked them to decide for themselves whether 'computer' should be a  masculine or a feminine noun. Each group was asked to give four reasons for its recommendation.
 
The men's group decided that 'computer' should definitely be of the feminine gender ('la computadora'), because:

1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic;

2. The native language they use to  communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else;

3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long term memory for possible later retrieval; and

4. As soon as you make a commitment to  one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for  it. 
 
(THIS GETS  BETTER!)

The women's group, however,  concluded that computers should be Masculine ('el computador'), because: 
 
1. In order to do anything with them, you have to turn them on;

2. They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves;

3. They are supposed to help you solve problems,  
but half the time they ARE the problem; and

4. As soon as you commit to one,  you realize that if you had waited a little longer, you could have gotten a  better model.

The women won.

Send this to all the smart women you know…

Yesterday I was at my local Wal-Mart buying a large bag of Purina dog chow for my loyal pet, Jake, the Wonder Dog and was in the check-out line when a woman behind me asked if I had a dog.

What did she think I had an elephant?

So because I'm retired and have little to do, on impulse I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, I was starting the Purina Diet again. I added that I probably shouldn't, because I ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.

I told her that it was essentially a Perfect Diet and that the way that it works is, to load your pants pockets with Purina Nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so it works well and I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in line was now enthralled with my story.)

Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care, because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no, I stopped to pee on a Fire Hydrant and a car hit me.

I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was Laughing so hard.

Wal-Mart won't let me shop there anymore. Better watch what you ask retired people. They have all the time in the World to think of crazy things to say. Forward this (especially) to all your retired friends...it will be their laugh for the day.

A very good article which takes two minutes to read. Heart Attacks And Drinking Warm Water

This is a very good article. Not only about the warm water after your meal, but about Heart Attacks. The Chinese and Japanese drink hot tea with their meals, not cold water, maybe it is time we adopt their drinking habit while eating.

For those who like to drink cold water, this article is applicable to you. It is nice to have a cup of cold drink after a meal. However, the cold water will solidify the oily stuff that you have just consumed. It will slow down the digestion. Once this 'sludge' reacts with the acid, it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food. It will line the intestine. Very soon, this will turn into fats and lead to cancer. It is best to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal.

Common Symptoms Of Heart Attack...

A serious note about heart attacks - You! should know that not every heart attack symptom is going to be the left arm hurting . Be aware of intense pain in the jaw line.
You may never have the first chest pain during the course of a heart attack. Nausea and intense sweating are also common symptoms. 60% of people who have a heart attack while they are asleep do not wake up. Pain in the jaw can wake you from a sound sleep. Let's be careful and be aware. The more we know, the better chance we could survive..

A cardiologist says if everyone who reads this post shares it to 10 people, you can be sure that we'll save at least one life. Read this &amp; Send to a friend. It could save a life...

Many of the farmers and their family had contracted it and many died. 
 
The doctor came upon this one farmer and to his surprise, everyone was very healthy.  When the doctor asked what the farmer was doing that was different the wife replied that she had placed an unpeeled onion in a dish in the rooms of the home, (probably only two rooms back then).  The doctor couldn't believe it and asked if he could have one of the onions and place it under the microscope.  She gave him one and when he did this, he did find the flu virus in the onion.  It obviously absorbed the bacteria, therefore, keeping the family healthy. 
 
Now, I heard this story from my hairdresser in AZ.  She said that several years ago many of her employees were coming down with the flu and so were many of her customers.  The next year she placed several bowls with onions around in her shop. To her surprise, none of her staff got sick.  It must work..  (And no, she is not in the onion business.) 
 
The moral of the story is...............buy some onions and place them in bowls around your home.  If you work at a desk, place one or two in your office or under your desk or even on top somewhere.  Try it and see what happens.   We did it last year and we never got the flu. 
 
If this helps you and your loved ones from getting sick, all the better. If you do get the flu, it just might be a mild case.. 
 
Whatever, what have you to lose?  Just a few bucks on onions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",,False,self,t5_2t776,False,,,True,t3_1c90rj,http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/1c90rj/fw_flu_and_onions/,

This is spot-on.

PLEASE, READ THIS TO THE END. IT IS VERY INTERESTING!!!

Wal-Mart vs. The Morons

1. Americans spend $36,000,000 at Wal-Mart Every hour of every day.

2. This works out to $20,928 profit every minute!

3. Wal-Mart will sell more from January 1 to St. Patrick's Day (March
17th) than Target sells all year.

4. Wal-Mart is bigger than Home Depot + Kroger + Target +Sears + Costco

K-Mart combined.

5. Wal-Mart employs 1.6 million people, is the world's largest private
employer, and most speak English.

6. Wal-Mart is the largest company in the history of the world.

7. Wal-Mart now sells more food than Kroger and Safeway combined, and
keep in mind they did this in only fifteen years.

8. During this same period, 31 big supermarket chains sought
bankruptcy.

9. Wal-Mart now sells more food than any other store in the world.

10. Wal-Mart has approx 3,900 stores in the USA of which 1,906 are
Super Centers; this is 1,000 more than it had five years ago.

11. This year 7.2 billion different purchasing experiences will occur
at Wal-Mart stores. (Earth's population is approximately 6.5 Billion.)

12. 90% of all Americans live within fifteen miles of a Wal-Mart.
You may think that I am complaining, but I am really laying the ground
work for suggesting that MAYBE we should hire the guys who run Wal-Mart
to fix the economy.

This should be read and understood by all Americans… Democrats,
Republicans, EVERYONE!!

To President Obama and all 535 voting members of the Legislature,
it is now official that the majority of you are corrupt morons:

a. The U.S. Postal Service was established in 1775. You have had 234
years to get it right and it is broke.

b. Social Security was established in 1935. You have had 74 years to
get it right and it is broke.

c. Fannie Mae was established in 1938. You have had 71 years to get
it right and it is broke.

d. War on Poverty started in 1964. You have had 45 years to get it
right; $1 trillion of our money is confiscated each year and transferred to
""the poor"" and they only want more.

e. Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965. You have had 44
years to get it right and they are broke.

f. Freddie Mac was established in 1970. You have had 39 years to get
it right and it is broke.

g. The Department of Energy was created in 1977 to lessen our
dependence on foreign oil. It has ballooned to 16,000 employees with a budget of
$24 billion a year and we import more oil than ever before. You had 32 years to get
it right and it is an abysmal failure.

You have FAILED in every ""government service"" you have shoved down our
throats while overspending our tax dollars.

AND YOU WANT AMERICANS TO BELIEVE YOU CAN BE TRUSTED
WITH A GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM??

Folks, keep this circulating. It is very well stated. Maybe it will end
up in the e-mails of some of our ""duly elected' (they never read anything)
and their staff will clue them in on how Americans feel.

AND

I know what's wrong. We have lost our minds to ""Political Correctness""
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Someone please tell me what is wrong with all the people that
run this country!!!!!!

We're ""broke"" and can't help our own Seniors, Veterans, Orphans, Homeless
etc. and the last months we have provided aid to Haiti, Chile, and Turkey and now
Pakistan ( the previous home of bin Laden). literally, BILLIONS of DOLLARS!!!

Our retired seniors living on a 'fixed income' receive no aid nor do
they get any breaks.

AMERICA: a country where we have homeless without shelter, children
going to bed hungry, elderly going without needed medicines, and mentally ill
without treatment, etc.

Imagine if the GOVERNMENT gave U. S. the same support they give to
other countries. Sad isn't it?

He did not identify the man, who has been charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction.

'Al-Gebra is a problem for us', the Attorney General said. 'They derive solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in search of absolute values.'

When asked to comment on the arrest, President Obama said, ""If God had wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more fingers and toes.""

After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. So they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night.

'I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,' she explained. 'I'm afraid the neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house.'

'Don't worry,' Jack said. 'We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.' The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night.

Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.

The first evening, the ship's Captain received the following note from the wife of a very wealthy and influential plantation owner:

""Dear Captain, Thursday will be my daughter Melinda's Debutante Ball. I would like you to send four well-mannered, handsome, unmarried officers in their formal dress uniforms to attend the dance.""

""They should arrive promptly at 8:00 PM prepared for an evening of
polite Southern conversation. They should be excellent dancers, as
they will be the escorts of lovely refined young ladies. One last
point: ""No Jews please.""

Sending a written message by his own yeoman, the captain replied:
""Madam, thank you for your invitation. In order to present the widest possible knowledge base for polite conversation, I am sending four of my best and most prized officers.""
""One is a lieutenant commander, and a graduate of Annapolis with an additional Masters degree from MIT in fluid technologies and ship design.""

""The second is a Lieutenant, one of our helicopter pilots, and a graduate of Northwestern University in Chicago , with a BS in Aeronautical Engineering. His Masters Degree and PhD. In Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering are from Texas Tech University and he is also an astronaut candidate.""

""The third officer is also a lieutenant, with degrees in both computer
systems and information technology from SMU and he is awaiting
notification on his Doctoral Dissertation from Cal Tech.""

""Finally, the fourth officer, also a lieutenant commander, is our
ship's doctor, with an undergraduate degree from the University of
Georgia and his medical degree is from the University of North
Carolina . We are very proud of him, as he is also a senior fellow in
Trauma Surgery at Bethesda .""

Upon receiving this letter, Melinda's mother was quite excited and
looked forward to Thursday with pleasure. Her daughter would be
escorted by four handsome naval officers without peer (and the other women in her social circle would be insanely jealous).

At precisely 8:00 PM on Thursday, Melinda's mother heard a polite rap at the door which she opened to find, in full dress uniform, four very handsome, smiling Black officers.

Her mouth fell open, but pulling herself together, she stammered,

The teacher said, ""You can't have a desk until you tell me how you earn them."" 

They thought, ""Well, maybe it's our grades."" 

""No,"" she said. 

""Maybe it's our behavior."" 

And she told them, ""No, it's not even your behavior."" 

And so they came and went in the first period, still no desks in the classroom. Second period, same thing. Third period. By early afternoon television news crews had gathered in the class to find out about this crazy teacher who had taken all the desks out of the classroom. The last period of the day, the instructor gathered her class. 

They were at this time sitting on the floor around the sides of the room. She said, ""Throughout the day no one has really understood how you earn the desks that sit in this classroom ordinarily. Now I'm going to tell you.""

She went over to the door of her classroom and opened it, and as she did 27 U.S. veterans, wearing their uniforms, walked into that classroom, each one carrying a school desk. And they placed those school desks in rows, and then they stood along the wall. By the time they had finished placing the desks, those kids for the first time I think perhaps in their lives understood how they earned those desks. 

Their teacher said, ""You don't have to earn those desks. These guys did it for you. They put them out there for you, but it's up to you to sit here responsibly, to learn, to be good students and good citizens, because they paid a price for you to have that desk, and don't ever forget it.""

Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a
distinct slow down in overall system performance, particularly in the
flower and jewelry applications, which operated flawlessly under
Boyfriend 5.0.

In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such
as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5 and then installed undesirable
programs such as NBA 5.0, NFL 3.0 and Golf Clubs 4.1. Conversation 8.0
no longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've
tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What
can I do?

Signed,
Desperate

*******************

DEAR DESPERATE,

First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, while
Husband 1.0 is an Operating System.

Please enter command: ithoughtyoulovedme.html and try to download Tears
6.2 and don't forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update. If that
application works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run
the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5.But remember, overuse of
the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence
2.5, Happy Hour 7.0 or Beer 6.1.

Please note that Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the
Snoring Loudly Beta. Whatever you do, DO NOT install Mother-In-Law 1.0
(it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of
all your system resources.) Also do not attempt to reinstall Boyfriend
5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.

In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited
memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider
buying additional software to improve memory and performance. We
recommend Cooking 3.0 and Hot Lingerie 7.7.

Good Luck,
Tech Support",,False,self,t5_2t776,False,,devilobama,True,t3_1egpym,http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/1egpym/fwd_fw_technical_problems_warning_grandma_humor/,

**A:  (Individual perspectives on the matter)**


&gt;Freud:
&gt;The fact that you thought that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

&gt;Bill Gates:
&gt;To purchase Chicken 2.01a, which will both cross roads and calculate the energy it used. There are bugs, yes, but if you uninstall Traffic 2.0 and Farmer 1.2 it will run. If it freezes at WhiteLine 2.0, we have a patch ...

&gt;Grandpa:
&gt; In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken had crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.

&gt;Ernest Hemingway:
&gt;To die. In the rain.

&gt;Sherlock Holmes:
&gt; Do not concern yourself with the chicken that did cross the road; the answer lies with the chicken that did not cross the road.

&gt;Saddam Hussein:
&gt;It is the Mother of all Chickens.

&gt;Roseanne:
&gt;(Bburrrrrp.) What chicken?

&gt;Jack Benny:
&gt; I'm thinking. ... I'm thinking

&gt;Buddha:
&gt;If you ask this question, you deny your own chicken nature.

&gt;Darwin:
&gt; Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally selected in such a way that they are now genetically predisposed to cross roads.

&gt;James Dean:
&gt;To prove he wasn't chicken.

&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr.:
&gt;I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.

&gt;Jackie Mason:
&gt;Whaddaya want, it should just stand there?

&gt;Fox Mulder:
&gt; It was a government conspiracy.

&gt;Colonel Sanders:
&gt; I missed one?

&gt;Arnold Schwartznegger:
&gt;I do not know, but It vill be back.

&gt;Jerry Seinfeld:
&gt;Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why doesn't anyone ever think to ask, ""What the heck was this chicken doing walking around all over the place anyway?""

&gt;Dr. Seuss:
&gt;Did the chicken cross the road?  
&gt;Did he cross it with a toad?   
&gt; Yes the chicken crossed the road,  
&gt;but why he crossed, I've not been told!  

&gt;O.J.Simpson:
&gt; It didn't. I was playing golf with it at the time.

&gt;Richard M. Nixon:
&gt; The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did not cross the road!

&gt;George Orwell:
&gt;Because the government had fooled him into thinking that he was crossing the road of his own free will, when he was really only serving their interests.

&gt;Plato:
&gt;For the greater good.

&gt;Timothy Leary:
&gt; Because that's the only kind of trip the Establishment would let it take.

&gt;Machiavelli:
&gt;The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why? The ends of crossing the road justify whatever motive there was.

&gt;Chico Marx:
&gt; It couldn't. It was a rubber chicken.

&gt;Groucho Marx:
&gt;Chicken? What's all this talk about chicken? Why, I had an uncle who thought he was a chicken. My aunt almost divorced him, but we needed the eggs.

&gt;Harpo Marx:

And so he got his wife to promise him, with all of her heart, that when he died, she would put all of the money into the casket with him. 

Well, he died. He was stretched out in the casket, his wife was sitting there - dressed in black, (what else), and her best friend was sitting next to her. When they finished the ceremony, and just before the undertaker got ready to close the casket, the wife said, ""Wait just a moment!"" She had a small metal box with her; she came over with the box and put it in the casket. Then the undertaker locked the casket down and they rolled it away. 

So her friend said, ""Girl, I know you were not fool enough to put all that money in there with your husband."" The loyal wife replied, ""Listen, I'm an Italian Catholic &amp; I cannot go back on my word. I promised him that I was going to put that money in the casket with him..""

I will do my best with reddit formatting.*

&gt;[Don't squat with your spurs on.](http://i.imgur.com/w5baesb.gif)

&gt;Will Rogers, who died in a 1935 plane crash, was one of the greatest political sages this country has ever known.  
&gt;Some of his sayings:

&gt;1. Never slap a man who's chewing tobacco.

&gt;2. Never kick a cow chip on a hot day.

&gt;3. There are two theories to arguing with a woman. Neither works.

&gt;4. Never miss a good chance to shut up.

&gt;5. Always drink upstream from the herd.

&gt;6. If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.

&gt;7. The quickest way to double your money is to fold it and put it back into your pocket.

&gt;8. There are three kinds of men:

&gt;**The ones that learn by reading.**  
&gt;**The few who learn by observation.**  
&gt;**The rest of them have to pee on the electric fence and find out for themselves.**

&gt; **9\. Good judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment.**

&gt; **10\. If you're riding' ahead of the herd, take a look back every now and then to make sure it's still there.**

&gt; **11\. Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier'n puttin' it back.**

&gt; **12\. After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he started roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him.**

&gt; **The moral**: ***When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut.***

&gt; ###ABOUT GROWING OLDER...  
&gt; ###First ~Eventually you will reach a point when you stop lying about your age and start bragging about it. 

&gt; ###Second ~ The older we get, the fewer things seem worth waiting in line for. 

&gt; ###Third ~ Some people try to turn back their odometers. Not me; I want people to know 'why' I look this way. I've traveled a long way, and some of the roads weren't paved. 

&gt; ###Fourth ~ When you are dissatisfied and would like to go back to youth, think of Algebra. 

&gt; ###Fifth ~ You know you are getting old when everything either dries up or leaks. 

&gt; ###Sixth ~ I don't know how I got over the hill without getting to the top. 

&gt; ###Seventh ~ One of the many things no one tells you about aging is that it's such a nice change from being young. 

&gt; ###Eighth ~ One must wait until evening to see how splendid the day has been. 

&gt; ###Ninth ~ Being young is beautiful, but being old is comfortable. 

&gt; ##Tenth ~ Long ago, when men cursed and beat the ground with sticks, it was called witchcraft.  
&gt; ##Today it's called golf. 

&gt; ###And, finally ~ If you don't learn to laugh at trouble, you won't have anything to laugh at when you're old.

family...

An 
emergency room physician told me that a woman in 
her late 20's came to the ER today with her 
8thpregnancy.
She told 
the first doctor she saw: ""My Mama told me that 
I am the 
breadwinner for the family."" He asked 
her to explain. She said that she can make 
babies, and babies get money from the State for 
the family. It goes like this:

The Grandma calls the Department of Child &amp; 
Family Services, and states that the unemployed 
daughter is not capable of caring for all of her 
kids.
DCFS agrees, and tells her the
children will need 
to go into foster care.

The Grandma then 
volunteers to be the foster 
parent, and receives a check for 
$1500 per child each month in 
Illinois.
Total yearly income:
$144,000 
tax-free and nobody 
has to go to work!
In 
fact, they get more if there is 
no 
husband/father/man in the home!
Not 
to mention free healthcare (Medicaid), plus a 
monthly card entitling them to free groceries 
and a voucher for 250 free Obama phone minutes 
each month. This does not include WIC and other 
welfare benefits...that they are ""entitled"" to.
 
 
Indeed, Grandma
was correct that her fertile daughter is the 
""breadwinner"" for the family. 

This is how the liberal 
politicians spend our tax dollars. When this 
generous program was invented in the '60s, the 
Great Society architects forgot to craft 
an end date...
and now we are hopelessly 
overrun with people who vote only for those who 
will continue to keep them on the dole....
No wonder our country is broke!
Worse, the Muslims have been paying attention, and by mandating that each Muslim family have eleven children, they will soon replace the voting bloc above and can be running this country within 25 years. Read the above again, until it sinks in, and then ask yourself if your Children, Grandchildren, and Great Grandchildren will survive these severe changes to America!!!
Are You alarmed yet?  Is anybody listening?
 
Is this a GREAT COUNTRY or 
what...?
Don't forget to pay your
taxes!
There 
are a lot of ""breadwinners"" 
depending on 
you!",,False,self,t5_2t776,False,,,True,t3_1503h2,http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/1503h2/fw_fw_fwd_fw_fwd_shes_a_breadwinner/,

This could happen to you.

I was barely sitting down when I heard a voice from the other toilet saying:
'Hi, how are you?' 

I'm not the type to start a conversation in the public toilet but I don't know what got into me, so I answered, somewhat embarrassed,
'Doin' just fine!'

And the other person says: 
'So what are you up to?' 

What kind of question is that? At that point, I'm thinking this is too bizarre so I say:
'Uhhh, I'm like you, just travelling!' 

At this point I am just trying to get out as fast as I can when I hear another question.
'Can I come over?'

Ok, this question is just too weird for me but I figured I could just be polite and end the conversation. I tell them
'No, I'm a little busy right now!!!'

Then I hear the person say nervously...

'Listen, I'll have to call you back. There's an idiot in the other toilet who keeps answering all my questions.'

two statues in a park; one of a nude man and one of a 
nude woman. They had been facing each other across a 
pathway for a hundred years, when one day an angel 
comes down from the sky and, with a single gesture, 
brings the two to life.

The angel tells them, 'As a 
reward for being so patient through a hundred blazing 
summers and dismal winters, you have been given life 
for thirty minutes to do what you've wished to do the 
most.'

He looks at her, she looks at him, and they 
go running behind the shrubbery.
The angel waits 
patiently as the bushes rustle and giggling 
ensues.

After fifteen minutes, the two return, out 
of breath and laughing.

The angel tells them, 'Um, 
you have fifteen minutes left, would you care to do it 
again?'

He asks her 'Shall we?'

positions.

I am sorry about getting into an argument about putting up the Christmas lights.  I guess that sometimes I feel like you are pushing me too hard when you want something.  I realize that I was wrong and I am apologizing for being such a hard-headed guy.  All I want is for you to be happy and be able to enjoy the holiday season.

Hi Honey, 
  
Thank you for that heart-felt apology.  I don't often get an apology from you, and I truly appreciate it.  I, too, felt bad about the argument and wanted to apologize.  I realize that I can sometimes be a little pushy.  I will try to respect your feelings from now on.  Thank you for taking the time to hang the Christmas lights for me.  It really means a lot.  In the spirit of giving, I washed your truck for you; and now I am off to the mall.

Subject: Fw: A Lawyer And A Senior

 
 
A lawyer and a senior citizen are sitting next to each other on a long flight.

The lawyer is thinking that seniors are so dumb that he could get one over on them easily.

So, the lawyer asks if the senior would like to play a fun game.

The senior is tired and just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and tries to catch a few winks

The lawyer persists, saying that the game is a lot of fun...""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me only $5.00. Then you ask me one, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00,"" he says.

This catches the senior's attention and, to keep the lawyer quiet, he agrees to play the game.

The lawyer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the Earth to the Moon?""

The senior doesn't say a word, but reaches into his pocket, pulls out a five-dollar bill, and hands it to the lawyer.

Now, it's the senior's turn. He asks the lawyer, ""What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?""

The lawyer uses his laptop to search all references he can find on the Net.

He sends E-mails to all the smart friends he knows; all to no avail. After an hour of searching, he finally gives up.

He wakes the senior and hands him $500.00. The senior pockets the $500.00 and goes right back to sleep.

The lawyer is going nuts not knowing the answer. He wakes the senior up and asks, ""Well, so what goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four?""

The senior reaches into his pocket, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.



You know you're going to send this one on.

Yesterday I was at my local COSTCO buying a large bag of Purina dog chow for my loyal pet, Jake, the Wonder Dog and was in the check-out line when a woman behind me asked if I had a dog.

What did she think I had an elephant? So since I'm retired and have little to do, on impulse I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, I was starting the Purina Diet again. I added that I probably shouldn't, because I ended up in
the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.

I told her that it was essentially a Perfect Diet and that the way that it works is, to load your pants pockets with Purina Nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so it
works well and I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in line was now enthralled with my story.)

Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care, because the dog food poisoned me.  I told her no, I stepped off a curb to sniff a poodle's ass and a car hit me.

I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was Laughing so hard.

Costco won't let me shop there anymore.

During my second month of college, our professor 

Gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student

 
 
And had breezed through the questions until I read

The last one:


""What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?""

Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the 

Cleaning woman several times. She was tall,

Dark-haired and in her 50's, but how would I know her name?



I handed in my paper, leaving the last question

Blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if 

The last question would count toward our quiz grade.



""Absolutely, "" said the professor. ""In your careers,

You will meet many people.  All are significant. They

Deserve your attention and care, even if all you do 

Is smile and say ""hello.""



I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her

Name was Dorothy. 



2. - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain 



One night, at 11:30 p.m., an older African American

Woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway

Trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had

Broken down and she desperately needed a ride.

Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car. 

A young white man stopped to help her, generally

Unheard of in those conflict-filled 19 60's.. The man

Took her to safety, helped her get assistance and

Put her into a taxicab.



She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down his

Address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a

Knock came on the man's door. To his surprise, a

Giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A 

Special note was attached.



It read:

""Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway

The other night. The rain drenched not only my

Clothes, but also my spirits.  Then you came along. 

Because of you, I was able to make it to my dying

Husband's' bedside just before he passed away... God

Bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving

Others.""



Sincerely, 

Mrs. Nat King Cole. 



3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those

Who serve. 



In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less,

A 10-year-old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and

Sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in 

Front of him.



""How much is an ice cream sundae?"" he asked. 

""Fifty cents,"" replied the waitress..



The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and

Studied the coins in it.



""Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?"" he inquired.



By now more people were waiting for a table and the

Waitress was growing impatient. 



""Thirty-five cents,"" she brusquely replied.



The little boy again counted his coins.



""I'll have the plain ice cream,"" he said.



The waitress brought the ice cream, put t he bill on

The table and walked away The boy finished the ice

Cream, paid the cashier and left..  When the waitress

Came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the 

Table.  There, placed neatly beside the empty dish,

Were two nickels and five pennies..



You see,  he couldn't  have the sundae, because he had

To have enough left to leave her a tip. 



4 - Fourth Important Lesson. - The obstacle in Our Path. 



In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a

Roadway..  Then he hid himself and watched to see if

Anyone would remove the huge rock.  Some of the

King's' wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by 

And simply walked around it.  Many loudly blamed the

King for not keeping the roads clear, but none did

Anything about getting the stone out of the way.



Then a peasant came along carrying a load of 

Vegetables.  Upon approaching the boulder, the

peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the

stone to the side of the road.  After much pushing

and straining, he finally succeeded. After the 

peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed

a purse lying in the road where the boulder had

been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note

from the King indicating that the gold was for the 

person who removed the boulder from the roadway.  The

peasant learned what many of us never understand!



Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve

our condition. 



5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts.. 



Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a

hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who 

was suffering from a rare &amp; serious disease.  Her only

chance of recovery appeared to be a blood

transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who had

miraculously survived the same disease and had 

developed the antibodies needed to combat the

illness.  The doctor explained the situation to her

little brother, and asked the little boy if he would

be willing to give his blood to his sister. 



I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a

deep breath and saying, ""Yes I'll do it if it will save

her.""  As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed

next to his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing 

the color returning to her cheek. Then his face

grew pale and his smile faded.



He looked up at the doctor and asked with a

trembling voice, ""Will I start to die right away"". 



Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the

doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his

sister all of his blood in order to save her.. 



Now you have 2 choices. 



1 Delete this email, or 

2. Forward it other people. 

I hope that you will choose No. 2 and remember. 



Most importantly..... ""Work like you

don't need the money, love like you've never been

hurt, and dance like you do when nobody's watching.""

&gt; &gt; SOMETHING
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; TO THINK ABOUT!!!!! 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Recently, 
&gt; &gt; in large French city, a poster featuring a young, thin and
&gt; &gt; tanned woman appeared 
&gt; &gt; in the window of a gym. It said:
&gt; &gt;  ¨THIS SUMMER DO YOU WANT TO BE A 
&gt; &gt; MERMAID OR A WHALE?¨
&gt; &gt;  A middle aged woman, whose physical 
&gt; &gt; characteristics did not match those of the woman on the
&gt; &gt; poster, responded 
&gt; &gt; publicly to the question posed by the gym. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  To 
&gt; &gt; Whom It May Concern:
&gt; &gt;  Whales are always surrounded by friends 
&gt; &gt; (dolphins, sea lions, curious humans). They have an active
&gt; &gt; sex life, they get 
&gt; &gt; pregnant and have adorable baby whales. They have a
&gt; &gt; wonderful time with dolphins 
&gt; &gt; stuffing themselves with shrimp. They play and swim in the
&gt; &gt; seas, seeing 
&gt; &gt; wonderful places like Patagonia, the Barren Sea and the
&gt; &gt; coral reefs of Polynesia 
&gt; &gt; . Whales are wonderful singers and have even recorded CDs.
&gt; &gt; They are incredible 
&gt; &gt; creatures and virtually have no predators other than
&gt; &gt; humans. They are loved, 
&gt; &gt; protected and admired by almost everyone in the world.
&gt; &gt;  Mermaids don’t 
&gt; &gt; exist. If they did exist, they would be lining up outside
&gt; &gt; the offices of 
&gt; &gt; Argentinean psychoanalysts due to identity crisis. Fish or
&gt; &gt; human? They don’t 
&gt; &gt; have a sex life because they kill men who get close to them
&gt; &gt; not to mention how 
&gt; &gt; could they have sex? Therefore they don’t have kids
&gt; &gt; either. Not to mention who 
&gt; &gt; wants to get close to a girl who smells like a fish store?
&gt; &gt;  The choice 
&gt; &gt; is perfectly clear to me; I want to be a whale.
&gt; &gt;  P.S. We are in an age 
&gt; &gt; when media puts into our heads the idea that only skinny
&gt; &gt; people are beautiful, 
&gt; &gt; but I prefer to enjoy an ice cream with my kids, a good
&gt; &gt; dinner with a man who 
&gt; &gt; makes me shiver and a coffee with my friends. With time we
&gt; &gt; gain weight because 
&gt; &gt; we accumulate so&gt; much information and wisdom in our
&gt; &gt; heads that when there is 
&gt; &gt; no more room it distributes out to the rest of our bodies.
&gt; &gt; So we aren t heavy, 
&gt; &gt; we are enormously cultured, educated and happy. Beginning
&gt; &gt; today, when I look at 
&gt; &gt; my fanny in the mirror I will think, ¨Good gosh, look how
&gt; &gt; smart I am.""

**A Florida Court Sets Atheist Holy Day!**
Gotta love this Judge! 

You must read this......
A proper decision by the courts...
For a change. 

A FLORIDA COURT SETS ATHEIST HOLY DAY

In Florida, an atheist created a case against Easter and Passover Holy days. He hired an attorney to bring a discrimination case against Christians and Jews and observances of their holy days. The argument was that it was unfair that atheists had no such recognized days. 

The case was brought before a judge. After listening to the passionate presentation by the lawyer, the judge banged his gavel declaring, ""Case dismissed!""

The lawyer immediately stood and objecting to the ruling saying,
""Your honor, How can you possibly dismiss this case? The Christians have Christmas, Easter and others.
The Jews have Passover, Yom Kippur and Hanukkah, yet my client and all other atheists have no such holidays.."" 
The judge leaned forward in his chair saying, ""But you do. Your client, counselor, is woefully ignorant."" 
The lawyer said,"" Your Honor, we are unaware of any special observance or holiday for atheists."" 
The judge said, ""The calendar says April 1st is April Fool’s Day. Psalm 14:1 states, 'The fool says in his heart, there is no God.' Thus, it is the opinion of this court, that, if your client says there is no God, then he is a fool. Therefore,
April 1st is his day.

Court is adjourned...""

**GENERAL COSGROVE:** We're going to teach them climbing, canoeing, archery and shooting.

I was in my neighborhood restaurant this morning and was seated behind a group of jubilant individuals celebrating the ... successful passing of the recent health care bill. I could not finish my breakfast. This is what ensued:

They were a diverse group of several races and both sexes. I heard the young man exclaim, “Isn’t Obama like Jesus Christ? I mean, after all, he is healing the sick.” The young woman enthusiastically proclaimed, “Yeah, and he does it for free. I cannot believe anyone would think that a free market would work for health care. Another said, ‘The stupid Republicans want us all to starve to death so they can inherit all of the power. Obama should be made a Saint for what he did for those of us less fortunate.” At this, I had more than enough.

I arose from my seat, mustering all the restraint I could find, and approached their table. “Please excuse me; may I impose upon you for one moment?” They smiled and welcomed me to the conversation. I stood at the end of their table, smiled as best I could and began an experiment.

“I would like to give one of you my house. It will cost you no money and I will pay all of the expenses and taxes for as long as you live there. Anyone interested?” They looked at each other in astonishment. “Why would you do something like that?” asked a young man, “There isn’t anything for free in this world.” They began to laugh at me, as they did not realize this man had just made my point. “I am serious, I will give you my house for free, no money what so ever. Anyone interested?” In unison, a resounding “Hell Yeah” fills the room.

“Since there are too many of you, I will have to make a choice as to who receives this money-free bargain.” I noticed an elderly couple was paying attention to the spectacle unfolding before their eyes, the old man shaking his head in apparent disgust. “I tell you what; I will give it to the one of you most willing to obey my rules.” Again, they looked at one another, an expression of bewilderment on their faces. The perky young woman asked, “What are the rules?” I smiled and said, “I don’t know. I have not yet defined them. However, it is a free home that I offer you.” They giggled amongst themselves, the youngest of which said, “What an old coot. He must be crazy to give away his home. Go take your meds, old man.” I smiled and leaned into the table a bit further. “I am serious, this is a legitimate offer.” They gaped at me for a moment.

“I’ll take it you old fool. Where are the keys?” boasted the youngest among them. “Then I presume you accept ALL of my terms then?” I asked.. The elderly couple seemed amused and entertained as they watched from the privacy of their table. “Oh hell yeah! Where do I sign up?” I took a napkin and wrote, “I give this man my home, without the burden of financial obligation, so long as he accepts and abides by the terms that I shall set forth upon consummation of this transaction.” I signed it and handed it to the young man who eagerly scratched out his signature. “Where are the keys to my new house?” he asked in a mocking tone of voice. All eyes were upon us as I stepped back from the table, pulling the keys from pocket and dangling them before the excited new homeowner.

“Now that we have entered into this binding contract, witnessed by all of your friends, I have decided upon the conditions you are obligated to adhere from this point forward. You may only live in the house for one hour a day. You will not use anything inside of the home. You will obey me without question or resistance. I expect complete loyalty and admiration for this gift I bestow upon you. You will accept my commands and wishes with enthusiasm, no matter the nature. Your morals and principles shall be as mine. You will vote as I do, think as I do and do it with blind faith. These are my terms. Here are your keys.” I reached the keys forward and the young man looked at me dumbfounded.

“Are you out of your mind? Who would ever agree to those ridiculous terms?” the young man appeared irritated. “You did when you signed this contract before reading it, understanding it and with the full knowledge that I would provide my conditions only after you committed to the agreement.” Was all I said. The elderly man chuckled as his wife tried to restrain him. I was looking at a now silenced and bewildered group of people. “You can shove that stupid deal up you’re a** old man, I want no part of it” exclaimed the now infuriated young man. “You have committed to the contract, as witnessed by all of your friends; you cannot get out of the deal unless I agree to it. I do not intend to let you free now that I have you ensnared. I am the power you agreed to. I am the one you blindly and without thought chose to enslave yourself to. In short, I am your Master.” At this, the table of celebrating individuals became a unified group against the unfairness of the deal.

After a few moments of unrepeatable comments and slurs, I revealed my true intent. “What I did to you is what this administration and congress did to you with the health care legislation. I easily suckered you in and then revealed the real cost of the bargain. Your folly was in the belief that you can have something you did not earn; that you are entitled to that which you did not earn; that you willingly allowed someone else to think for you. Your failure to research, study and inform yourself permitted reason to escape you. You have entered into a trap from which you cannot flee. Your only chance of freedom is if your new Master gives it to you. A freedom that is given can also be taken away; therefore, it is not freedom.” With that, I tore up the napkin and placed it before the astonished young man. “This is the nature of your new health care legislation.”

I turned away to leave these few in thought and contemplation and was surprised by applause. The elderly gentleman, who was clearly entertained, shook my hand enthusiastically and said, “Thank you Sir, these kids don’t understand Liberty these days.” He refused to allow me to pay my bill as he said, “You earned this one, it is an honor to pickup the tab.” I shook his hand in thanks, leaving the restaurant somewhat humbled, and sensing a glimmer of hope for my beloved country.

He asked her, ""Your Majesty, how do you run such an efficient government? Are 
there any tips you can give me?""
 
""Well,"" said the Queen, ""the most important thing is to surround yourself with 
intelligent people.""
 
Obama frowned, and then asked, ""But how do I know the people around me are 
really intelligent?""
 
The Queen took a sip of tea. ""Oh, that's easy; you just ask them to answer an 
intelligent riddle..""
 
The Queen pushed a button on her intercom. ""Please send Tony Blair in here, 
would you?""
 
Tony Blair walked into the room and said, ""Yes, Your Majesty?""
 
The Queen smiled and said, ""Answer me this please, Tony, your mother and father 
have a child. It is not your brother and it is not your sister. Who is it?""
 
Without pausing for a moment, Tony Blair answered, ""That would be me.""
 
""Yes! Very good,"" said the Queen.
 
Obama went back home to ask Joe Biden the same question. ""Joe, answer this for 
me..  Your mother and your father have a child.  It's not your brother and it's 
not your sister. Who is it?""
 
""I'm not sure,"" said Biden. ""Let me get back to you on that one.""
 
He went to his advisors and asked every one, but none could give him an answer.
 
Finally, he ran into Sarah Palin out eating one night. Biden asked, ""Sarah, can 
you answer this for me?  Your mother and father have a child and it's not your 
brother or your sister. Who is it?""
 
Sarah Palin answered back, ""That's easy, it's me!""
 
Biden smiled, and said, ""Thanks!"" Then, he went back to speak with Obama.
 
""Say, I did some research and I have the answer to that riddle. It's Sarah 
Palin!""
 
Obama got up, stomped over to Biden, and angrily yelled into his face, ""No! You 
idiot! It's Tony Blair!""

The light turned yellow, just in front of him.  He did the right thing, stopping at the crosswalk, even though he could have beaten the red light by accelerating through the intersection. 

The tailgating woman was furious and honked her horn, screaming in frustration, as she missed her chance to get through the intersection, and her cell phone and makeup. 

As she was still ranting, she heard a tap on her window. She looked up and saw the face of a very serious police officer who ordered her to exit her car with her hands up. 

He took her to the police station where she was searched, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed in a holding cell.

After a couple of hours, a policeman approached the cell and opened the door.  She was escorted back to the booking desk where the arresting officer was waiting with her personal effects. 

He said, ""I'm very sorry for this mistake.  You see, I pulled up behind your car while you were blowing your horn, flipping off the guy in front of you and cussing a blue streak at him.  I noticed the 'What Would Jesus Do' bumper sticker, the 'Choose Life' license plate holder, the 'Follow Me to Sunday-School' bumper sticker, and the chrome-plated Christian fish emblem on the trunk, so naturally....I assumed you had stolen the car.""

&gt;Once upon a time, a powerful Emperor of the Rising Sun advertised for a new Chief Samurai.  After a year, only three applied for the job:  a Japanese, a Chinese, and a Jewish Samurai.

&gt;""Demonstrate your skills!"" commanded the Emperor.

&gt;The Japanese samurai stepped forward, opened a tiny box, and released a fly. He drew his samurai sword and *Swish!* the fly fell to the floor, neatly divided in two!

&gt;""What a feat!"" said the Emperor. ""Number Two Samurai, show me what you do.""

&gt;The Chinese samurai smiled confidently, stepped forward and opened a tiny box, releasing a fly. He drew his samurai sword and * Swish! * Swish! * The fly fell to the floor neatly quartered.

&gt;""That is skill!"" nodded the Emperor.
 
&gt;""How are you going to top that, Number three Samurai?""

 It is clean and funny.

A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night to meet, and have a dinner with her parents. 


Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first time.

The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms.. He tells the pharmacist it's his first time and the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. 


At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. 
The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.

That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. 

""Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!""

The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. 
The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down.


10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.

Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, 'I had no idea you were this religious..'


The boy turns, and whispers back, 'I had no idea your father was a pharmacist.'

...They used a poster child for this to get everybody's sympathy and to get
everybody's emotions up so that they could hopefully bring in a gun ban. They used a
little poster child, a little blonde-haired blue-eyed six year old girl. She was the
face, the poster child. She was supposedly killed along with the other 19 six year
olds and seven year olds at Sandy Hook. Three days later Obama was there doing a
photo op and she's sitting on his knee. She's supposed to be dead, used as a poster
child, this little girl died - she's sitting on Obama's knee three days later. The
same little girl. 

And then they have her parents interviewed. It shows that they're all actors. It
never really happened, because the guy that was supposedly her dad, is shown in the
video where he's to the side and he's laughing and joking with other people and then
he's called up in front of the camera. He's off to the left. Then he's called to the
center, to the focus of the camera to be interviewed and to give his speech about
Sandy Hook and about his daughter. And he goes from on the side from laughing and
joking with everybody, he comes up to the center and ... he takes the joking,
smiling face off and you can see him physically trying to force his face to look sad
and then he starts talking about how his daughter's been killed. They're actors.
There were no bodies. 

It was a made for TV drama to try to ram through the gun control laws, because they
want to kill the American people and they can't kill armed people. That's why Hitler
disarmed the Germans, it's why Stalin disarmed the Russians, it's why chairman Mao
disarmed the Chinese and they killed between them something like 120 million of
their own people. And that's what they want to do in America and they can't do it
because the people have the Second Amendment and they have guns. So they have to do
all of this, and they'll keep doing it. There will be more incidents like this,
which are made for television, until they manage to persuade the American people to
give up their guns. And then they'll start killing the Americans. Because the
Americans are the only people stopping them from doing what they want to do already.
They know they can't put their next phase, which is reducing the world's population,
they can't put that phase into operation whilst the Americans have got millions of
guns. ",,False,self,t5_2t776,False,,,True,t3_16iift,http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/16iift/fw_fwd_sandy_hook_shooting_didnt_happen_proof/,

She saw a sea of blank faces, except for Little Akio, a bright foreign exchange student from Japan , who had his hand up: ""Patrick Henry, 1775,"" he said.

""Very good! -- Who said, 'Government of the People, by the People, for the People, shall not perish from the Earth'?""

Again, no response except from Little Akio: ""Abraham Lincoln, 1863..""

""Excellent!"" said the teacher continuing, ""Let's try one a bit more difficult -- Who said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country'?""

Once again, Akio's was the only hand in the air and he said: ""John F. Kennedy, 1961.""

The teacher snapped at the class, ""Class, you should be ashamed of yourselves, Little Akio isn't from this country and he knows more about our history than you 
do.""

She heard a loud whisper: ""F_ _ k the Japs.""

""Who said that? -- I want to know right now!? she angrily demanded..

Little Akio put his hand up, ""General MacArthur, 1945.""

At that point, a student in the back said, ""I'm gonna puke.'

The teacher glares around and asks, 'All right! -- Now who said that?""

Again, Little Akio says, ""George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.""

Now furious, another student yells, ""Oh yeah? -- Suck this!""

Little Akio jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, ""Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!""

Now with almost mob hysteria someone said, ""You little shit! -- If you say anything else -- I'll kill you!""

Little Akio frantically yells at the top of his voice, ""Michael Jackson to the children testifying against him, 2004.""

The teacher fainted. As the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said, ""Oh shit, We're screwed!""

Little Akio said quietly, ""The American people, November 4, 2008.”",,False,self,t5_2t776,False,,,True,t3_12jt6y,http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/12jt6y/fwfwfwd_little_akio/,
