Since it was close to our 10 year anniversary I figured I'd also surprise her with something else.  She didn't know what until we arrived....but it was a 2 night stay at the [Salish Lodge](http://www.salishlodge.com/) (AKA The Great Northern) as well as a visit to some of the sites where they filmed one our favorite TV shows of all times.  


[This shot](http://i.imgur.com/QJw0H.jpg) should be pretty obvious, the waterfall behind the Great Northern.

Now, all the [interior shots](http://i.imgur.com/wnkPS.jpg) of The Great Northern were filmed at a different place called the [Kiana Lodge](http://www.kianalodge.com/main.html).  

The Kiana lodge is also the location of [the log](http://i.imgur.com/2QLly.jpg) where Laura washed up.  Near the log is a rather [nifty plaque](http://i.imgur.com/gXeUW.jpg).

A very short drive from the Salish Lodge is [Twede's Cafe](http://i.imgur.com/F7D8u.jpg).  This is the restaurant that they based the Double R Diner off of.  Fantastic pie, we had to eat there twice :)  ([Wide shot of Twede's](http://i.imgur.com/whccj.jpg))

The Twin Peaks tattoo I got about a year ago was based off [the ring in the movie](http://i.imgur.com/F2Pib.jpg).  It's on my upper left arm, and looks [like this](http://i.imgur.com/PdkiP.jpg)!

Let's make this place even better.,demote,61,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/pnp2h/coming_changes_to_rtwinpeaks_and_an_appeal_for/,"Hey r/twinpeaks! I started this subreddit over a year ago, and in that time it has gained a fair amount of attention (almost 500 subscribers, wow!). I'm thrilled to see so many twin peaks fans out there. In short, I want to do an overhaul of this reddit, and make things pretty. I'm a designer by trade, but my CSS abilities are lacking. I'm looking for a/several CSS savvy redditers to join me on my r/twinpeakstest reddit and help me implement some of the things this reddit needs. **Primarily a functioning spoiler tag system.** Mine sucks, and I've been having trouble fixing it. I have a bunch of other ideas for cool ways to trick this page out.

I already have a first-pass design built out, and i think it's going to be sweet. I just need a hand executing it. 


Thanks for keeping this subreddit alive and growing. You are all fine, upstanding people.

I wondered if I could start any sort of discussion about the 'prequel' film, FWWM....

Much loathed on initial release, as time goes by the film has underwent a huge critical reappraisal (BBC critic Mark Kermode reckoned it was one of the greatest horror movies ever made).

I personally love FWWM; 

I adore the initial half hour with Kiefer Sutherland/Chris Isaak/Harry Dean Stanton; I love David Bowie's bizarre appearance;


Overall, it is a richly shot movie, with beautifully lush colours and visuals...Angelo Badalamenti's soundtrack is second to none (plus luckily for those who don't know, almost every unreleased TP/FWWM track is now up for download for a small fee on davidlynch.com), and I think more than any David Lynch film, the sound design is absolutely stunning (and this is from a man whose work had lush sound design) It is a near perfect fusion of image and sound, all creating a weird, unsettling atmosphere.

One of the major complaints people lodge (haha) against the film is in terms of narrative...They feel that it suffers because it lacks the whimsy of the series, it doesn't tie up loose ends (introducing even more, in fact) and especially they feel that is is unecessary to tell the 'last seven days of Laura Palmer', because that is pretty much detailed in the series.
I disagree with these three narrative complaints;
Firstly, the film is primarily focused upon Laura; thus imagine as though the film is 'told' or 'viewed' from her perspective...her life is pretty dark and shitty, thus the humour must be cut out...the series is 'viewed' through the enthusiastic outsider (primarily) Cooper, who views the world as a wondrous place, thus the series seems bright and chirpy in places. I think this tonal shift is a brilliant move on Lynch's part, demonstrating the shifting perspectives of characters through the almost charring shift in tone.
As for the loose ends, with Twin Peaks and FWWM Lynch/Frost and the rest have created an outstanding combination of mysteries: on one hand it skirts the surreal 'weird for the sake of being weird' as seen in say Eraserhead, but marries this beautifully with legitimate plot mysteries, such as the nature of the Lodges and their effect on the Northwest.
As for the grumblings of those who feel we don't need to SEE Laura's story...Well, Lynch said that he went back to focus upon her because he had 'fallen in love' with the character...Lynch is hugely sympathetic to females, pretty much idolizing them (though I won't get into overall accusations of misogyny here). In the series, Laura and her murder serve as a MacGuffin; throubgh Laura's death, we are allowed a window into the world of Twin Peaks; characters react to her death, many things progress as a direct result of her death. However, in the series she serves merely as a plot device narratively speaking, and in terms of character, she is an ABSENCE.
However, Lynch does an incredible service to his creation...his gives this plot device life! He makes her a presence, not an absence! And the tale is so scary, so heartbreaklingly sad, we wonder how we could have ever laughed at Leland's white haired, jovial antics. Rather than making her another 'Noir-esque' 'murdered girl' trope, Lynch givers her agency, flesh, makes her story tangible, not a tragic abstraction which prompts other characters to act in certain ways.

I hope some people can share their thoughts? ",,False,,t5_2rodn,False,,,True,t3_10gffb,http://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/10gffb/fire_walk_with_me_the_film/,

It was a satisfying ending, but nonetheless I was aghast. 

The fact that Cooper wasn't able to handle the Dark Lodge and was consumed by fear surprised me. I saw Cooper in a Herculean light;, he was honest, smart, and invincible. 

I thought he would emerge from the Lodge victoriously. Cooper was able to face Jean Renault, who came off as sick and twisted. He was able to put aside Audrey, avoiding carnal temptation. And when Harry seemed over the edge, he brought him back.

I've been wondering for a week now, could have anyone in Twin Peaks successfully overcome the Dark Lodge? I thought maybe Harry could have. After his loss, what could through him off? What about Andy, he seemed pure of heart/soul. Or Major Briggs, his only fear being 'love is not enough.'

&gt;Kyle MacLachlan refused to further develop the storyline about his character Dale Cooper’s relationship with Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn), resulting in the writers having to abruptly change and add several second season story lines. As originally scripted, Audrey Horne would have been the one kidnapped by Windom Earle and taken to the Black Lodge in the series finale; the characters of Justice Wheeler and Annie were written in specifically to give Dale and Audrey “appropriate” love interests. At the time, the relationship between Cooper and Audrey was heavily publicized in TV Guide and other entertainment magazines, akin to the press given to later TV “power couples” (such as Mike and Susan of Desperate Housewives). The move alienated audiences and caused a further decline in the show’s already suffering ratings. At the time, Kyle MacLachlan attributed his insistence to a belief that the morally upright Cooper would not date an underage girl; however, Audrey was a high school senior who, in the time line of the series, would have graduated in one to two months, and in fact was not “underage”— in Washington state, the age of consent is sixteen, and Audrey is seventeen in the pilot. Crew members who would later attend the annual Twin Peaks convention would recall that MacLachlan was pressured into the decision by his then-girlfriend, Lara Flynn Boyle, who did not want her boyfriend sharing love scenes with Fenn, with whom Boyle did not get along on set.

It makes me pretty mad, actually. I can take or leave Audrey/Cooper, but the fact that so much of Lynch's intended vision was changed because of LFB's (alleged) beef with Sherilyn Fenn really gets me pissed.  I feel like the latter half of season 2 would have been so much better if all this behind the scenes drama hadn't gone on. Annie and John Justice Wheeler wouldn't have been introduced, perhaps that kitschy storyline with James and that woman wouldn't have been necessary to flesh out episodes.

I completely agree with Kyle MacLachlan in regards to Cooper morally objecting to a relationship with a teenage girl, but that could have been the focus of the storyline. The internal struggle.

TLDR; I've just finished watching Twin Peaks and have been reading and thinking about it too much. With this show, it's just so easy to get caught up with what could have been.",,False,,t5_2rodn,False,,,True,t3_16yg86,http://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/16yg86/spoilers_hows_audrey/,

There are many different theories as to why he did this, but the one that I like is that Warhol understood the importance of the quotidian, so he sought to preserve it. That is most in line with Warhol's own theories of art. 

I found this strangely similar to what Cooper does with Diane. I'm curious as to what r/twinpeaks makes of this sort of connection. Could it perhaps be related to Lynch's ideas that the quotidian, normal, ""American"" life are just a surface? Perhaps Lynch was referring to the inability to language to capture what has truly happened?

* What's this about owls?
* I kinda got the impression aliens were involved somehow...?

* Who or what put the marks on Briggs and the Log Lady?
* What about the White Lodge? Where's that?
* How does the oil Cooper got come into play? It was supposed to open an entrance but he never actually did anything with it, and it clearly wasn't necessary since Earle got into the Black Lodge just fine without it...

But watching it now (this is my third time through), I realized that these side stories are really wonderful additions into the depths of the world of Twin Peaks, which is what I love about the show so much. 
I watch this show to find some sort of escape into such a dream-like fantasy world, and without these seemingly meaningless side-plots, I would be left with a much shallower perspective into this world.

So I went to trying to decode it to see if I could find something more substantial in the end than just ""Coop loses"". Here's the conclusion I've come to.

You have two potential endings in my model.

Ending A is where Coop loses. It's the ending taken at face value. Coop runs, is caught, and his body becomes Bob's puppet. Bad end. Sad end. Everybody loses. The entire series is left with a really bad taste to it.

Ending B is a bit different. You need to read what's been put in front of you. Bob has been shown to play a long game. Yet in the end we see him just out himself and start screaming and raving like a maniac when there are people in the next room. He completely loses composure. The only time we have seen Bob lose composure completely is when he was caught when he was inhabiting Leland. When he was trapped.

So ending B is essentially that Coop tricked Bob and managed to trap him, thus catching the killer in such a way where he won't be able to find his way back to the Black Lodge, sacrificing his own physical form to do so. In this scenario, the end is Bob realizing he's lost. Not celebrating victory.

Without sounding mean, I don't care about Nadine's story, I don't care about Andy and the english guy (anymore), and I don't care about Josie anymore. The storylines have become so convoluted and absurd that i just don't see a point aside from the bragging rights of ""i finished it!""

anyway, i return to my question: should i finish the remaining 12 something episodes?

I've been at home the past few days and am now on S2E07. I'm not exactly sure why I started watching Twin Peaks; I guess I'd seen the term randomly over the years enough that I decided to click Play on Netflix, without really looking into what it was about. It was pretty random, and I'm not sure why I thought to try it out. Anyway, I love it, so I figured I'd find the subreddit, which had to exist. 

This show is... something else. From Hawk's matter-of-fact head-nodding lines to Coop's quirks, to wondering what Shelly really wants, to Andy and Lucy's awkward romance, to the mysterious and captivating theme music, references to the majestic trees, and at least up until now, wondering if there *is* in fact a supernatural element or if the mysteries are all explainable without that factor - of course, now I know that higher powers exist in the show. All the little things added in make this show unique. It's got a deeper character than just about anything else I've seen.

I love a couple episodes ago when the guys were discussing some events at the Sheriff's station with the thunderstorm outside. I love the stacked donuts arranged in a grid. I love how Jerry and Ben interact, and Jerry's fixations with all these cool, and mostly edible, trinkets from around the world, and the people and places he gets excited about. I love how Sheriff Truman, Cooper, and Log Lady (who taps her log along with the music) get beers together at the roadhouse. I love the cozy lodge-style architecture of many of the buildings, and how comfortable and at-east everyone seems in the Sheriff station. Every minor character that's introduced isn't purely for efficient plot points, but actually adds character to the show, and to the very ambiance and magic of the city.

It's truly rare to find a work that can really draw me in, that's so well thought-out and lovingly crafted that it's its own universe, that I feel like I'm there. I savor every moment of it, and have tired easily of many shows.

I've subscribed to this subreddit in the hopes of immersing myself even more in the lore and mystique of Twin Peaks. Look forward to talking to you all.

Just found out Tojamura is Catherine. Knew there was something weird about that mustache. And about Leland -gasp-.

This being Vegas, I knew this place was going to be terrible. So, I excitedly went in.

It's hard to tell if this place is actually trying to capitalize on the Twin Peaks license or if it's simply its own 'Hooters'-type restaurant. The font used throughout the place is clearly Twin Peaks-esque:

Instead of playing awesomely moody music, they simply have a fuck-ton of Sports games playing:

I just finished watching Twin Peaks and would like to throw out a potential interpretation of the film.  First, I think that everything that we see throughout the film is filtered through the consciousness of Dale Cooper.  I believe that all the characters are a manifestation of his subconscious.  More specifically, these characters are trying to bring about a resolution to an unresolved trauma in Dale's life.  I don't think that we're ever given a look at the real world [unlilke Mulholland Drive where the final 30minutes provides the key to unlocking the truth].

However, regarding the 'truth' in Twin Peaks, I think that we are given quite a number of clues.  Most of the relationships in the film are love triangles - laura, donna, james + lucy, andy, dick tremain + nadine, mike, ed + ed, nadine norma + norma, hank, ed + ben horne, donna's mother, donna's father etc, etc.  The entire film is Dale's means of coping with a lost love.  Each triplet offers a different path toward resolution, or a different facet of his feelings about his own love triangle...

Ladies and gentlemen, I recently purchased the DVD boxset of Twin Peaks, reduced from €85 to €25 (a good price if you ask me). Normally I do not buy DVD boxsets of television shows; I normally stream them on the internet illegally, but what with the recent crack down on streaming sites as well as the difficulty in finding good streams of older, less mainstream shows that are consistently reliable, I decided to go all out and spend my real-life hard earned cash. These are my reviews.

At this point you might be asking yourself why you would want to read my reviews, and I am offering you two reasons. The first being that I like to review films and television shows a lot, and while I think of myself as a fairly normal person, people frequently tell me that I pick up on things they miss, and vice versa, so maybe you might learn something. The second reason is that I will assume most of you have watched the series in it's entirety, and I am now offering you the opportunity to watch it (again) for the first time vicariously through me. You can laugh as I fall for the same tricks you did, cry as you remember seeing it for the first time, and hopefully be genuinely informed by another person's perspective on the show.

Up until this point in my life, I have managed to remain entirely spoiler free of Twin Peaks. I have intended to watch this show for the last three years, and this has been my first opportunity to do so. Because I always knew I would watch this show, I made a deliberate effort to avoid all references to it over that lengthy period of time. However, it has been difficult to avoid all of the references to Twin Peaks in popular culture, and while I undoubtably missed most of them, I would often here names like ""Dale Cooper"", ""Laura Palmer"", and the show title mentioned. Suffice to say though, I know nothing about this television show, and I have no experience with David Lynch as a writer/director, except for having seen Dune (one of my favourite books and movies) multiple times, and The Elephant Man as a child. 

I have heard that Twin Peaks was a seminal piece of television production, and to this day many people still proclaim it as their favourite show. As a person who watches a lot of TV, it is rather shameful that I have never watched it. I remember seeing parts of an episode as a child, but I do not recall anythig of it. I have heard that it was partially inspired by The Twilight Zone, and went on to inspire The X-Files and Lost, as well as many others. If it is half the show that they were (at their respective primes), then it will surely be a favourite of mine.

The DVD copy of Twin Peaks that I attained proclaims to have the original broadcast pilot on it, but the brief reading I did on the internet about this suggested to me that that version is impossible to purchase commercially. Perhaps it has been released? Or perhaps it's just false labeling/advertising. Needless to say I will not be losing sleep over this. At the start of the pilot I was given the option to watch with the ""Log Lady Introduction."" I could not find anything on the internet to suggest that I should or should not watch this, and after a few minutes, the DVD began to play automatically and made the decision (with the intro) for me. 

**Without any further ado, I shall proceed to my review. It is doubtful that I will prelude further reviews with a foreword such as this, but I cannot promise anything.**

At the start of this episode, it seems everything is quite simple. A girl has been murdered, there's a case, there's friends, possible witnesses etc., but soon things turn very complicated. I still haven't made the connection between all of the characters yet. I don't know who is the ""main cast"", and who were guests. I don't know who will become important later. I do know that Donna is quite hot, and I hope nothing bad happens to her in the long run. However, she seems like the type of person to get herself into trouble, so I know that it will.

I love Cooper's endless enthusiasm for everything, and as such I think he serves as a good expy for the audience (he is from out of town after all), as opposed to the Sheriff who initially served this purpose. I am questioning whether Diane is actually a real person or not. Sure, we are to suppose that she is the Scully to his Mulder, and that he worked with her on the previous case (the girl mentioned toward the end of the episode that died one year previous if I remember correctly), but something about the way that he meticulously records everything for her to hear at a later date speaks a lot about him. Of course, there could be many possibilities here, and I'm only speculating, but I would like to state at this point that there is something curious about their relationship.

A sidenote: The chant ""The Norwegians are leaving!"" seems very Monty Python-esque, and served as one of many points in this episode that I laughed out loud. In fact, one could easily argue that this show was a black comedy.

I'm not sure of the significance of the lady from Hong Kong who owns the saw mill. It is a long time since 1991, and I don't recall how exotic a person from Hong Kong would have been back then, especially in Northern USA. It is not a very cosmopolitan area (obvious point really), so I can assume that there is some kind of cultural divide between her (and by association the Sheriff?) and the rest of the town. On the other hand, she has lived in the town for several years and seems thoroughly Westernised, but maybe this will just serve to point out to us that people can be racist even when there is barely any difference between the two parties.

So, now we have this Audrey girl, who is also quite attractive. I am sidetracking here for a second. During her second scene, at the book lockers with Donna, James arrives later. I cannot remember if it is Audrey or James who says to Donna ""nice day for a picnic."" This is an obvious reference to the picnic that we find out about later, but depending on who says it could be either very plot significant, or not terribly at all.

Is Lucy (the Sheriff's secretary) the same actress who plays Patrick Bateman's secretary in American Psycho? I know I could look this up on IMDB, but I prefer to use human brain power where possible.

Donna's sister Harriet seems like a complete wackjob. I initially just thought she was an odd actress, but at the end of the episode when Donna's father is saying how proud of how level-headed she is (after sneaking out at night, during curfew, while a killer who preys on young girls is on the loose), he then goes on to say ""I'm so glad I have a daughter like you."" Honestly, I thought both she had been portrayed as, and her father had described her as a pretty ordinary teenage girl, so this makes me wonder how much Harriet will differ from the norm (if at all).

Now, we must get to the forests. I probably wouldn't have picked up on Dale Cooper's fascination with the trees, and would have just ascribed it to his unbridled enthusiasm if it weren't for the Log Lady's introduction. She mentioned something very vague about the forests that surround Twin Peaks, and almost alluded that they take people, or define the town's fate or something. This coupled with the (apparent, but as yet unexplored) significance of the saw mill seems to suggest there's more to the trees than they seem. Are the trees pissed off at the town for cutting them down, and are now cutting down the citizens? Or have I just watched too many M. Night Shyamalan movies? We will wait and see.

Thank you for reading, that's all for now.

TL;DR: I find this show incredibly intriguing, and came away with many questions. However, I don't feel confused (yet). It all seems very in control and well paced.",,False,,t5_2rodn,False,,,True,t3_pl8fy,http://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/pl8fy/i_have_started_watching_twin_peaks_these_are_my/,

They wrote/directed some of the best episodes especially around the beginning and ends of both seasons.

What I'm wondering is, in the episodes where they didn't have a hand in either the writing or directing of the episodes, did they have any input at all? Or did they just completely hand the show off to other people to direct and write the show however they wanted?

I wouldn't expect David Lynch to stick around and direct and write every episode of the show, but at the same time it seems weird to me that he would completely hand his idea off to other people and then come back later to direct the finale.

A lot of this might apply to other TV shows as well, but I was specifically curious about TP because it seems like such a great idea that when Frost/Lynch created it I was wondering why they would step back from it after a few episodes.",,False,,t5_2rodn,False,,,True,t3_19ko7g,http://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/19ko7g/i_have_some_questions_regarding_the_writing_and/,

Trying to come up with some general ideas for what could happen to some of the townsfolk or just quirky traits and characteristics. Not trying to be too quirky (""Hey! What if instead of The Log Lady...there's this guy, and he like...talks to an empty bucket!"" Yeah no, that isn't good and it's too literal)

Another way to phrase it would be, if Twin Peaks were on the air now, what's something you would like to see on the show? An interaction between characters, a trait/characteristic, etc.

I asked a few people the same questions and both of them started rattling off a list of ""Wouldn't it be weird if..."" things. Not really what I'm going for, it's not Fringe or The X-Files.
