Simply use either your mouse scroll wheel or the left and right arrow keys to look through all the characters. For the children, the skills shown may need to be passed through a parent. You're gonna have to figure that one out yourself. Also, I didn't include MU as there were so many that they all didn't fit on the screen and it's pretty obvious which skills you can get. I highlighted skills I think are the best.

To use just extract all the files from the .zip into a folder and double click AwakeningClasses.exe.

It was made for personal use, so it's not really pretty or anything, but I figured maybe someone else would find it useful in trying to create the perfect team. Hope you enjoy.

EDIT: Just realized all the children with Donnel are messed up and are actually what the child would be with Kellam. Fixing now.

EDIT2: Fixed the Donnel problem. Redownload if you downloaded earlier.

So it seems that our sub has basically doubled since a few short weeks ago and I am seeing a ton of really awesome questions about certain features of the game which maybe are not fully explained properly. I just wanted to explain some of them to maybe ease the struggles of some players who are going through the game on normal/hard. (My lunatic guide will be coming out shortly)


**One of my characters is weak. How do I train them?**

There are a couple of ways. First you could use reeking boxes (probably the simplest method **on normal**. They only cost 500 gold on hard they are 4800.) On hard it gets a little bit more tricky because the price goes up. There are two main ways to get XP. Either do the DLC over and over again, using a couple of your strong units and just the weak unit to soak up exp by last hitting enemies, OR fight the teams that come in the bonus box **WARNING, THEY ARE SOMETIMES HARD**.

**What's the difference between spotpass and outworld gate? What is free and what isn't?**

The general consensus is that any paid DLC will be coming through the outworld gate. The outworld gate let's you permenantly buy challenge maps. You can play them as many times as you would like, and at the end you usually receive a new unit (well a copy of a unit from an older game, but that's not the point).

 
**Should I overgrind?**

That depends on how comfortable you are feeling with the game. When I did my first run I definitely overgrinded and by chapter 12 I had 7 or 8 units with max stats and the best skills. It made the game too easy. On hard I would recommend spending some time to level up some of the weaker units you get later on in the game. **I know that theives, tricksters, etc may not be the strongest class but make sure at least on of your units gains the ability to open chests and doors, then just switch that unit to whatever class you want**

**What is this spotpass content and how do I access it?**

Ok when you are on the world map, hit **X**. It should bring up a menu and hit wireless. There a a couple options.  (Look at this to see them all (http://imgur.com/a/ZAvIF)

1. Streetpass team. Thats a team you can set up to send out to other FE player so they can battle it

2. Bonus box is where you download characters from other FE titles and place them in your world. You can either fight them and if you beat them you get the new unit, or you can just buy the new unit outright with gold

3. Renown awards. You get rewards at different levels of renown. You get more renown by battling streetpass teams or collecting more bonus box units.

4. Double Duel. Challengs your friend's units. You basically compete to kill off computer controlled units in a 2v1 battle. 

5. Avatar logbook. Lets you summon other units from different playthroughs into your world. Here's an example of avatars from other games. www.imgur.com/NeCtzgS


**What are second seals and master seals?**

Ok so a master seal will promote a base class to an advanced class. Cavalier to paladin (or great knight) lord to great lord, etc etc. Now the second seals are basically side upgrades. Let's say you have a level 10 myrmidon and you want to be a fighter, well use a second seal and your Level 10 myrm becomes a level 1 fighter and you can start leveling your unit up as a fighter(there are other choices too!). As well, if you have a unit that is an advanced class (let's say a swordmaster) you can change them into another advanced class that you like better/has skills you need.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
*One thing I might add is that while Second Seals bring you back to level 1 as a different class, you maintain all your previous stat gains and skills, but now you gain experience as a level 1 character. I just think it's worth adding since it's a pretty compelling argument to use Second Seals all day every day.
It's something that I couldn't find online, and had to experiment myself to figure it out. I kept thinking, ""Why would I use a Second Seal and let all these awesome stats go to waste, just for another skill?"" But yeah, nothing goes to waste. It's super exp efficient to use them early.*

1361144505.0,56,self.fireemblem,18pumd,Galeforce Guide,inkWanderer,66,10,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/18pumd/galeforce_guide/,"Built from /u/Vague_intentions well-written [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/18nz8n/how_should_i_run_noire/c8glv5g). Read their comment for a more in-depth discussion on pairings. 

Galeforce is easily the best skill in the game, essentially doubling each unit's efficiency. It's unlocked by levelling a Dark Flier to level 15, and it allows that character to act again after killing an enemy. If two characters with Galeforce are paired, they can attack 3 times that turn. I've also used it as a movement-extender in order to reach fleeing thieves. 

Anyway. It's good. So, here are the childbearing characters:

* Lissa (Owain)
* Sumia (Cynthia)
* Maribelle (Brady)
* Cordelia (Severa)
* Olivia (Inigo)
* Tharja (Noire)
* Nowi (Nah)
* Sully (Kjelle)
* Cherche (Gerome)
* Panne (Yarne)
* Miriel (Laurent)
* MU (male or female) (Morgan)
* Chrom (Lucina)

Of the listed characters, the following can become Dark Fliers and therefore pass on Galeforce to their children, or by virtue of the fighter class will give Galeforce to their female children*:

* Lissa 
* Sumia
* Maribelle
* Cordelia
* Olivia
* MU (male or female)
* Gaius
* Donnel

The following three characters need to be matched with a male MU, Gaius, or Donnel in order for their child to have Galeforce:

* Tharja
* Nowi
* Sully

And that leaves Cherche, Panne, and Miriel's children (whose mothers cannot become Dark Fliers and are male themselves) without Galeforce.

Regardless of your MU's gender, you will always be able to have 6 children with Galeforce without any special matchups. 

* Owain - Myrmidon
* Cynthia - Pegasus Knight
* Brady - Priest
* Severa - Mercenary
* Inigo - Mercenary**
* Morgan - base class of MU's spouse

If your MU is female, then you can have up to 8 children with GF if Gaius and Donnel marry Tharja, Nowi, or Sully. 

* Noire - Archer
* Nah - Manakete
* Kjelle - Knight

If your MU is male, then you can have up to 9 children with GF if Gaius, Donnel, and MU marry Tharja, Nowi, and Sully (using whichever pairings you please). 

Chrom must marry Sumia, Maribelle, Olivia, or MU for his child to have Galeforce. Given that his only other option is Sully anyway, that's usually not a problem. :P


*Children inherit the last equipped skill from both parents, and are able to become any class either parent could be, with the exception of gender-restricted classes: Fighter and Barbarian are male-only, while Pegasus Knight and Troubadour are female-only. Should a male Fighter or Barbarian have a female child, his classes will be translated into the female specific versions. Fighter turns into Pegasus Knight and Barbarian turns into Troubadour. 

**/u/waywrong points out that Olivia has a unique skill: Luck +4. You'll have to choose which to pass down to Inigo; this is mostly a moot point unless you want to do some luck-based shenanigans (such as permanent Armsthrift, guaranteed bullion, etc).",,False,self,t5_2t0cn,1361153513.0,,,True,t3_18pumd,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/18pumd/galeforce_guide/,

I got to see my Grandma and Great Aunt and a host of 1st and 2nd cousins. Three of them were little kids ages 2,4, and 6. And as the only teacher in the vicinity, I was immediately given the job of babysitter. It wasn't too bad, all things considered. When I finally ran out of energy, I brought out my 3DS (finally got it back!) and got them to take 3D pictures of everything and doodle on the pictures. Just so you know: DS is a better babysitter than TV. 

Eventually, the oldest boy Jackson wanted to try some games and the only thing I had with me was Fire Emblem Awakening. I had no idea if this was the kinda game he'd like but he wanted to play it, so I began the task of teaching a 6-year-old how to play Fire Emblem, one the more difficult jRPGs around. He loved making his own avatar (named Jackson, of course) and I am convinced he would have thrown the whole thing down in boredom if he didn't have the avatar character in there. It was just a huge selling point to him. He wasn't a great reader yet (though he could read some), so he skipped all the tutorials and most of the story he just mashed through, so I gave him the cliff's notes versions as he went. He had a little trouble maneuvering characters around at first, and the concept of ""select button"" and ""cancel button"" for navigating menus seemed alien to him, but he picked it up quickly enough. 

Trying to explain the finer details of weapon triangle and ranged attacks was pretty much a lost cause, but he was pretty content just to move the main character Chrom and ""Jackson"" around slaughtering everything on Normal/Casual difficulty. I could see his little face light up with strategic possibilities when he got the healer Lissa and suddenly there was this unit who had this really weird ability to make good units healthy again! I think that was the moment he was hooked, when he realized he was going to be recruiting all these team members with different skills and abilities. 

I felt so accomplished just showing him how the game worked and then watching him play four maps without pausing for air until his sister demanded a turn to take more 3D pictures. By the end, he was even reading the story sections, and considering his otherwise untoward opinion of reading, it was pretty awesome. Today, I have witnessed the birth a new gamer.

1361391814.0,44,self.fireemblem,18wmxh,"This game doesn't have a traditional stat gain system. If you're new to the series, read here for a reader's digest version of stats and reclassing",,52,8,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/18wmxh/this_game_doesnt_have_a_traditional_stat_gain/,"Most RPGs define characters by their class. The ""thief"" character, the ""paladin"" character, etc. Fire Emblem: Awakening DOES NOT do this, even though it may seem like the characters are cookie cutter class stereotypes. 

**CLASS SETS AND RESPECCING**

When you gain a new member, they will already be classed. Don't think that their starting class defines that character, though! Each character has a unique set of 3 classes they can change to with second seals. Virion, for example, can change from his beginning Archer class to a Mage or a Wyvern Rider. Each of these classes can further promote to one of two advanced classes, which you can also spec out of freely. So Virion could end up as a [](#s ""Sniper, Bow Knight, Wyvern Lord, Griffon Rider, Sage, or Dark Knight""). Lots of options! Your MU can become any class (outside of gender-specific incompatible classes). You should keep in mind how you want each character to end up, so you can get the skills you want and avoid that ""buyer's remorse"" feeling when you realize you could have done it differently. However, almost all of the skills are useful for almost all of the classes, so you don't need to worry too much if you're not a perfectionist.

**STATS**

When a character levels up, several things happen. Each stat a character has has a percentage change of leveling up depending on the character and the class. Skill gains are pure luck -- if you get a lot of stats on one level, that doesn't mean you have to ""make up"" for it by getting low gains the next level. Everything in this game is ruled by the RNG.

When you change classes, you don't adopt a new set of stats. Your unit keeps its stats, with a small modifier for balance. If you respec your low-STR healer into a pegasus knight, expect her to hit like a kitten with polio. This is an interesting mechanic because it means each character has its own 'spin' on each class (Sumia makes a quick, double-hitting knight while Vaike makes a high-damage thief). It's a big factor early in the game, but later you can always bring any unit's stats to the class ceiling, explained below.

Each class has a ceiling for each stat, but you won't need to worry about that until late in the game. This is the main reason promoted units are better later on -- they have higher ceilings, and therefor higher stats if you've gained the appropriate number of points. When you ""respec down"" to a class that has a lower ceiling, the game will lower your stats but remember how many gains you have, so they will be back where they were before when you respec back to the better class.

**SKILLS**

At levels 1 and 10 (normal classes), 5 and 15 (advanced classes), or 1 and 15 (dancer, taguel, manakete), your character will unlock a permanent skill depending on what class it is. For example, if Vaike becomes a level 10 fighter, he will get a permanent +5 crit bonus that he keeps no matter what class he is. The more you respec and explore each character's class options, the more skills you will pick up.

This also means that exploring a base class past level 10 does nothing for you. You will continue to accumulate the stat gains of the class so you won't fall behind and end up with a weak character, but you won't be working towards any new skills unless you respec.

**LEVEL AND RELATIVE POWER**

You characters' levels mean absolutely nothing when it comes to the units' power. You can ignore it entirely when you're trying to compare your units together. A level 1 character can be twice as powerful and gain experience half as quickly as a level 18 character. The only thing that level means to you is how close you are to earning the next skill for that class. 

If you hit the ""full"" button on a character's info page, you will see a big rating number in the top right of the new screen. This is what you should use to judge which characters are weaker and need to be trained. Looking at the level, again, isn't good enough to be able to tell.",,False,self,t5_2t0cn,1361401527.0,,,True,t3_18wmxh,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/18wmxh/this_game_doesnt_have_a_traditional_stat_gain/,

I'd give you guys a speech, but I'm nowhere near done and I know it. For now I'm going to be working on bestiaries and stuff, as well as details in the rules themselves.

In a few calculations I've noticed that a lot of damage is done due to Defense being too low. If need be I'll up HP or defense, I'll think about that later.

Alright, so I've seen a lot of posts about who to pair with who for the best kids so I figured I'd make this guide real quick. First off, here's a Serene's Forest page that helped me a lot in figuring out inheritance. That link can be a bit confusing though so I'm going to try to explain the optimal pairings more clearly.

http://serenesforest.net/fe13/children.html

I'm going to be going through this step-by-step so that hopefully you can figure out how the systems works a little bit for yourself instead of just scrolling down to the bottom and copying what I've put there. Although I will think no less of you if you do so. Also, the walkthrough will help if you decide to go for a skill that isn't Galeforce. If you don't want to min/max your kids, don't read this guide. If you're very averse to pairing people with ""bad chemistry"" you probably shouldn't read this guide. I fucking hate Tharja x MU, but I did it for Noire. I don't care what you say Tharja is like Overattatched Girlfriend with creepy curse powers. When I go through on Lunatic I'll probably go Nowi x MU even though I find that a little creepy as well since she looks 13. Or maybe Sully, idk. Whatever. Let's get on with the guide.

Ok, so I think that most people here agree that ""optimal"" means getting as many kids as possible to have Galeforce. Of the three things that you can inherit I believe that the hierarchy goes like this: Unique Inheritable Skills &gt; Classes &gt; Stats. Most of the time a few stat points won't be better than getting a new class and their skills (although if the skills are really bad I guess stats would be better), and definitely won't be better than getting Galeforce (or another gender unique skill).

So, for me, the first step in determining who to pair with who was to split all the mothers into four different groups. You can do this with whatever skill you'd like to pass on, although if it's not gender-exclusive like Galeforce you don't need to bother with the Male/Female distinction. Male MU and Chrom are special since they're the only males with children, but for now it's easiest to think of them as mothers.

Note that the male-only Fighter class will turn into the female-only Pegasus Knight class (and by extension Dark Flier/Galeforce) upon passing it down to a daughter.

**Access to Galeforce - Female Children** (Children will always have access to Galeforce)

Sumia - Cynthia

Cordelia - Severa

MU (Male) - Morgan (F) (Although MU does not have access to Galeforce he will always pass down the Dark Flier class to Morgan (F))

**Access to Galeforce - Male Children** (Children must inherit Galeforce from their mothers)

Lissa - Owain

Olivia - Inigo

Maribelle - Brady

MU (Female) - Morgan (M)

**No Access to Galeforce - Female Children** (Children must inherit the Dark Flier class from a father's Fighter class)

Sully - Kjelle

Chrom - Lucina (Must marry a female that can pass down the Dark Flier class)

Tharja - Noire

Nowi - Nah

**No Access to Galeforce - Male Children** (Unfortunately, these poor children cannot experience Galeforce for themselves and must watch their friends zip around the battlefield killing everything before they can)

Cherche - Gerome

Panne - Yarne

Miriel - Laurent

Okay, so now we need to divide up the fathers to determine which ones can pass down the Pegasus Knight class down to their daughters. There are only three:

Gaius

Donnel

Male MU

Don't ask me why Vaike doesn't pass down Fighter ---&gt; Pegasus Knight. I don't know. I haven't tested it, but Serene's Forest says that he can't.

Anyways, these are the only three fathers that matter. The rest you can pretty much match up with whoever after we're done with these three. The three fathers listed above **must** be paired in some combination with mothers that have female children, but don't have access to Dark Flier/Galeforce themselves. These mothers are Tharja, Nowi, and Sully. Who you pair with who out of these three fathers (MU (Male), Donnel, and Gaius) and mothers doesn't matter so you have some freedom.

Now, for mothers with female children and access to Galeforce (Sumia, Cordelia, MU (Male)) their children will always have access to Dark Flier so you don't need to worry about who you pair them with or who you think fits them best or whoever gives the best class coverage/stat caps.

For mothers with male children (Lissa, Olivia, Maribelle, and MU (Female))and access to Galeforce their children must receive the Galeforce skill via inheritance because as males they will not be able to access the Dark Flier class.

For mothers without access to Galeforce and male children (Miriel, Panne, and Cherche), unfortunately their children cannot get Galeforce.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

Q: Why do I care about this guide?

A: You're reading it.

Q: How do I choose which skill to pass on?

A: The last skill equipped will be passed on. Please note that the inherited skill is determined when you enter the sidequest to recruit the kid, not at the time of conception, better known as when you get the S support. (See? Life doesn't begin at conception guys!)

Q: Is Galeforce really *that* good?

A: Yes, it's that good. Aside from essentially doubling the unit's effectiveness it also gives you a distinct tactical advantage over the enemy. You can run in, take out a weak unit, and then run back out of enemy range. If you have two Galeforce units you can pair them up and have one of them get a kill, move to the next enemy, switch, then the second Galeforce unit can get the kill and activate Galeforce AGAIN.

Q: What if I want to go for a different skill/class?
A: You can do the same process of dividing the mothers into four groups, and then finding fathers that can also pass the skill or class down. If the skill or class isn't gender exclusive you don't need to sort according to child gender.

**tl;dr** here's what I did.

No unique skills means that they don't have access to any skills that their kids won't, but you'll still probably want to pass on your best skill to them (bottom skill in the skill equip menu when you start the kid's recruitment mission will get passed on).

Chrom (Will always pass Aether) x Sumia (No unique skills): Both kids will get Galeforce via Sumia's classes.

Frederick (No unique skills) x Olivia (Galeforce) : Inigo gets the female-only Galeforce. Freddy gives awesome class coverage.

Stahl (No unique skills) x Lissa (Galeforce): Another male character getting the female-only Galeforce.

Henry (No unique skills) x Maribelle (Galeforce): Brady gets Galeforce via inheritance.

Gaius (Sol) x Sully (No unique skills): Gaius' male-only fighter becomes Peg Knight for Galeforce. Sol's probably the best of the unique skills here.

Kellam (No unique skills) x Cordelia (Galeforce): Class coverage from Kellam + Galeforce from Corelia.

Vaike (No unique skills) x Cherche (Renewal): No Galeforce. Vaike gives good class coverage. Still kind of confused about Renewal. Serene's Forest lists it as a unique inheritable for Gerome, but it also shows that he gets the War Cleric class and can learn it so I'm not sure what's up with that.

Ricken (No unique skills) x Panne (Strength +2): Kinda meh options with Panne.

Lon'qu (No unique skills) x Miriel (Renewal): Maximum class coverage due to no Galeforce. Renewal is still really nice though.

MU (Counter) x Tharja: MU's male-only Fighter class becomes Peg Knight for Galeforce pwnage. Morgan and Noire both get the male-only counter.

Donnell (Aptitude) x Nowi (No unique skills): Donnell's fighter = Peg Knight. Aptitude is cool too, although Counter would be better long-term I guess.

**So yeah, that's the guide. Hopefully I didn't confuse anybody.

*Warning: Some spoilers/etc.*

I heard about the FE series for the first time a few months ago when a couple of friends were talking about Awakening coming out and how they were going to buy a 3DS for this one game. I had two thoughts going through my mind when I heard this, ""What the heck is Fire Emblem and why do they want to buy a 3DS for this *one* game?"" along with ""Awesome! People to play Mario Kart 7 with!"". Needless to say, they never got Mario Kart 7 on top of a high level of skepticism about their praise of a series I had never heard of before that point. I bought a 3DS ages ago for OoT, Mario Kart, etc., and couldn't really fathom a single game weighing in enough to warrant a 3DS purchase.

*Let me get this out of the way that I am pretty sure there are a handful of these posts from first time FE players on this subreddit every week, so sorry if these posts are getting old.*

Continuing on, the game took me by surprise on multiple [fronts](http://i.imgur.com/Kd1MdAP.jpg). The *quality* of the game is superb and it took me a good while to ""figure out"" how the interactions of my character and other characters played in the grand scheme of things. I'm talking about from a behind the scenes point of view. At no point did I feel like the game was too heavily scripted and weaving me toward an inevitable conclusion. Many games only offer an illusion of interaction meant to keep the player satisfied until they reach the end. Too often do I find myself halfway through a game realizing that the world simply ""appears"" to be independent of the player. The minute details a developer pays attention to really add to the experience and usually you eventually notice the cut corners and game design flaws. These realizations expose the charade made by game developers to keep the players immersed. Fire Emblem: Awakening is not plagued by an inherently flawed design or failed implementation. Everything about this game felt fresh and natural.

I started this journey with only a fraction of the interest that I ended it with. Having finished the story one time through I can definitely say this is one of my all time favorites and will probably be replayed and beaten to death over and over for the next few years, but what made this game amazing?

**Getting started**

Well, the first to mention is how quick the game had me going. I popped the game in, chose Hard/Classic, made the character, watched the cinematic, and was on my way. Looking back on it, the game did an amazing job of introducing a new player to the series considering the daunting complexity behind the game and its mechanics. The closest thing I have played to FE prior to Awakening was Pokémon. I was basically going into this blind. Regardless, I quickly learned what I needed to know to perform the basic functions such as moving and attacking thanks to the short, concise ""Guide"".

**Dialogue**

Early on I realized how perfect the balance between ""voiced"" dialogue and text would be. A fully voiced dialogue can be a hindrance to the flow of a game, especially if the game is heavily focused on tactically combat, as is the case with Fire Emblem. The balance between the short chirps a character would make during each chunk of dialogue and the bulk of what they were saying was perfect. A quick ""yes!"" or ""huh?"" with a considerably larger amount of text really animated the characters without being overbearing.

**Difficulty**

One thing I picked up over the years is to choose the ""middle"" or ""highest"" difficulty when playing a new game. Most games I tackle these days are way too forgiving on ""Easy"" and usually ""Medium""(or in this case Hard) is more akin to ""Easy"" for games of the past. This game, at least for a new comer of the series, really wasn't kidding when it said ""Hard"". Despite the game being very challenging, often making me redo missions when one of my favorite characters would die, I never felt cheated. Every obstacle had a solution and every solution could be fine tuned to be more efficient. I found myself critically thinking about my strategies all the way from mapping out my character progression and abilities to positioning and formation, which would vary from map to map. The game forces the you to use your wits to complete each stage and rewards the player with a sense of accomplishment and experience. It's a pretty rare occurrence to find myself learning new tricks and maneuvers right up until the very end of a game these days. Fire Emblem: Awakening did not fall short in this regard.

**Story** 

There isn't much to tell in regards to the finer details. The game had an interesting story, but it was nothing breath taking. The manner in which the story is presented is what resonated with me and puts it above the competition. There were no big reveal(s), huge plot twists, or inspiring tales of courage and heroism, but there was something deeper and equally enriching in it's own right. To illustrate this, let me explain how I perceived Awakening:

[SPOILERS](#s ""The story had a familiar, popular setup. You have your introductory segment -&gt; first 'big evil' -&gt; tragedy -&gt; Overthrow first evil. This concludes the 'first part'. The second part goes time skip -&gt; new evil (unknowingly related to last evil) -&gt; overthrow new evil -&gt; new evil wasn't the 'final evil' -&gt; Recoup -&gt; Defeat final evil."")

Sorry if the formatting of that was a tad confusing, but this basic outline is used in many games and stories. In short, this game doesn't have a brilliant or unique story. The finer details are unique to the series, sure, but it would be a stretch to say this story was anything close to a ""masterpiece"".

Despite the story being straight forward and at times cliché/cheesy, the game delivered on one key component that separates Fire Emblem: Awakening from all the over games I have played... and that is:

**The Characters**

This is what makes Fire Emblem: Awakening. The characters have a plethora of interactions with one another and huge amounts of dialogue between them. Two characters' dialogues and interactions might not amount to a whole lot, but that is part of the beauty. You don't have just a handful of characters, you have dozens of them. Each with different comments about one another and relations that can be built upon. The depth of the characters exceeds my wildest expectations and it is delivered completely through bite sized chunks at a leisurely pace throughout the game. A game so driven upon tactical combat is seemingly overshadowed by a bigger picture, a story told from the perspective of a tactician(the player) who interacts with, and is one of, the many characters of the game. You become attached to the characters, not wanting to give them up or let them meet a gruesome end at an enemy's lance, and that makes the game enjoyable on a fundamental level.

Never before have I been so moved by characters who spoke so little. I didn't just talk to them and listen to their conversations. You are interjected into the story and get to be part of the ragtag group. You're not just a mysterious overseer, but a character of the story who gets to be there as its shaped. Through battles, small talk, and growing individual relationships you become attached to your allies. Their deaths sadden you. The fear that one might die exists. The suspense that something might happen to one of them persuades you to play smart and accomplish the mission with everyone surviving. You will genuinely care about the means to an end. I didn't want to, nor could justify, sacrificing a comrade to beat a mission. The emotional attachment to your characters as they battle together, grow accustomed to one another, and many times 'seal the deal' with marriage is unrivaled by most games that I have played prior to Awakening.

So while the story is nothing extraordinary, the characters pull you into the world and enhance the experience. The conjunction of story, plot, and character development in Fire Emblem: Awakening is the reason it is one of the finest in the games in the industry.

**The Music**

The music is great. It has its quirky, peaceful JRPG music and its epic themes. Overall, the music is better than most, and arguably *very* good. The tracks are never distracting and the tend to stick with you. A sign of a good game is when you finish it and revisiting the soundtrack imbues you with nerd-chills and emotions. The music, while not the best of any game I have played, speaks for the quality of the game as a whole. No corners were cut all the way down to the sound track. [SPOILER](#s ""Having chosen to sacrifice myself at the end"") of the game followed by the reactions of the characters to my decision really sunk in and the emotions are easily be brought back up by something as simple as [listening to the soundtrack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4QTEzsCRIE). *That*, my friends, is what makes this soundtrack so good.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

This game was great. I dumped 50-60 hours on my first play through on Hard/Classic with it being my first Fire Emblem game. Needless to say, I am hooked. The wall of text can be intimidating, and I wouldn't really recommend anyone to read it unless they wanted to revisit some nostalgic feelings of when they played through Awakening for the first time, but I can say this: If you are reading this post, have a 3DS, and have not played a Fire Emblem game or specifically Awakening, get to it! The game, while not the best ever made, is a high quality work that I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with. Easily one of my favorites to date. Now if you excuse me, I am going to replay the shit out of this game. Tons of stuff left to do!

I miss the fact that Swordmasters and Snipers are pretty underwhelming sure they have some nice skills and all but especially for the Swordmasters critical hit rate be higher. This was my favorite class and anyone who was a myrmidon was in my book an automatic badass that turned into a swordmaster and could just about kill anything.

Another little annoyance is that as much as I hate to say it I actually kind of miss the soldier/lancemen class. This came to when I found out that I recruit Nephenee the equivalent of a swordmaster but with lances but instead I found out that instead she is a knight class instead and that disheartened me a little.  She was one of my best characters in Path of Radiance but now she doesn't maintain any of her noteworthy stats that she should have had from the previous game.  

I think this one had a bunch of other people as well as me confused, why can a **DARK** KNIGHT not use **DARK** MAGIC... to me this name is just completely contradictory and yes I know only a person that has the skill Shadowgift but why should that be a skill when it would just make sense for certain classes just so that they wield a specific weapon?

Lastly I feel as though for the DLC characters that they should have just left the characters their actual classes why only give them special skills that just instead makes them a semi different soldier? Why not keep the classes as they were and just be considered a special class like they did with Marth?

All of the characters sound fantastic. I and a lot of people hate when a character has a dialogue bubble, but the dialogue is also spoken by the voice actor. You can always read faster than they speak, and it makes for an awkward experience. The system Awakening uses adds the perfect amount of personality and flavor to the dialogue without making the voice acting overbearing (looking at you, Tales Of series).

When I heard Marth, I was little mad. I thought they just used one of their generic female voice actors, it sounded off and didn't fit a young male character.

First strike connects, leaving her dangerously low. 
Lon'qu activates Astra. I'm totally screwed. 

Suddenly, Cordelia leaps in the way of the first strike. Dual guard! Lon'qu whirls around and strikes again. Dual guard. This repeats until ALL FIVE attacks were blocked.

The Golden Gaffe pack is nice in the sense that it reduces the amount of time it would take you to do something, but I can't decide if this is a good thing or a bad thing. When I think DLC I think content, this type of DLC seems a bit more like microtransactions to me, something I adamantly despise. However when this is hidden behind content it doesn't feel as bad. 

I think that my willingness to buy the DLC speaks more about the quality of this game. Make a good game and people will buy DLC, regardless of what it is.

8-4:Speaking of doing something difererent, we have to ask a question a lot of the fans are wondering -- what happened with the feet? (laughs)

Kusakihara:(Laughs) Well, they're there...they're just...omitted a little bit. 
The idea was to add a unique sort of deformation to the characters. As for why it ended up like this... At the start of the project, we weren't entirely sure how many bones and joints we'd be able to use in each character model. As it is now, there's a joint at the knees, and then there's nothing below that for the ankles and the feet. This makes it a bit easier to apply animation to models as well. We found out afterward that, with the 3DS, we had more than enough CPU strength available to flesh out the models a bit, add real ankles and so on. We were like ""Well, if there's a next time, maybe there'll be more ankles..."" (laughs) 
We thought we could make it something that would work well with the characters, but now I'm not so sure. (laughs) So it's hard to give a real reason for it, but...well, I think it's kind of cute, though! (laughs) Isn't it? They look like they're wearing high heels. Aren't high heels the big fashion these days? 

8-4:Did you get any feedback about this from Japanese players as well?

Kusakihara: Yeah, some people focused on the feet a lot. (laughs) I think if this was a game that involved people kicking and such, we would have put in real ankles. Instead, you're using handheld weapons for the most part, so we figured we could sort of omit some of the detail down there...

Yokota:We did get feedback about that in the playtesting sessions, but by that point it was like ""Well, we can't do much about that now."" (laughs)

Kusakihara:A lot of people seemed really preoccupied with the feet... Ah, well. (laughs)

When you play Classic, if a character dies, you restart the chapter and play through it until every character survives. So, in the end, regardless of whether you play Classic or Casual, everyone survives.

This does not make them identical. Playing Classic forces you to play the game more cautiously. If you make a mistake, someone will die, and you have to start over and, very importantly, cannot make the same mistake. Enemy reinforcements are very frustrating in this game, because they attack the same turn they appear, so you can't prepare for them, and I understand why people get turned off to that. But if it kills one of your characters, you restart and you prepare for it next time.

I'm not knocking Casual, I think it's great that they put it in the game. But please understand that you're not playing the same game. The end result may be the same, in that all of our characters survived, but I spent way longer on each chapter. And when I do beat a chapter, I get to know that I beat it flawlessly.

1360121447.0,34,self.fireemblem,17z7r4,A Veteran's Guide to the New Features in FE:A,Chernab0g,40,6,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/17z7r4/a_veterans_guide_to_the_new_features_in_fea/,"Hi guys! So I'm sure you are all busy playing FE:A so nobody will probably actually read this but I wanted to clear some things up.

There is a ton of misinformation surrounding some of the more dubious features of the game such as DLS, spotpass, getting characters from other FE titles, second seals and item/exp farming. 

I just beat FE:A so I thought I would provide some insight.


**There is no arena!!!! ?**: The short answer is reeking boxes. They cost 500 gold and place an enemy team at the location you are standing on when you use it. (Some people think it is random). Furthermore, the levels scale so a box used on chapter 17 will have stronger enemies/more exp/better weapon drops when compared to one used on chapter 4.

**How do I access DLC?**: There are a couple of ways:

1. Push X when you are on the world map and go to wireless. With spotpass activated, you can download teams, challengers, maps etc via the ""bonus box"". This is how you summon previous characters into your world. To recruit the characters, go to where they spawned and either buy them (if you have the cash) or during battle you must defeat their team and talk to their leader with chrom.

2. After chapter 4 or 5 the outworld gate spawns on the map. Go to it to buy/download DLC when available.

**THE ONLY MAP DLC RIGHT NOW IS FREE TILL MARCH, THEN IT COSTS 2.50**

**What is the difference between a master seal/second seal?**:

A master seal will promote  your unit's base class to the advanced class of your choosing. For example, I turn my myrmidon into a swordmaster. 

NOW a second seal is WAY more fun. Let's say I get a new character and it is a myrmidon and I HATE myrmidons. I can use a second seal to change them into let's say, a fighter. THEN once I get that fighter to lvl 15, I can promote to a berserker/warrior etc. 

Now. Let's assume I went Myrmidon-&gt;level ten (use second seal) to fighter-&gt;level 15 (use master seal) to warrior. I can max out my warrior at lvl 20 and just have him sit there wasting valuable stat upgrades, or once I get the warrior's final skill unlocked at lvl 15, I just use ANOTHER second seal and turn them into a hero/berserker whater and start working on additional skills.. My Vaike right now has all the skills unlocked that are available to him.

Now, your tactician... Once you master seal it into its' advanced class, second seal it at lvl 15 and you have access to change it into 95% of the classes in the game. Yup, that's right. Your tactician can now be basically anything. Your tactican can learn all the skills in the game!!!!

**OMG seals are so expensive and I has no monies!**: Just wait. Make sure you unlock the skill despoil for as many characters as possible. Your luck becomes a % chance to find a small bullion after you kill an enemy. My Vaike has a 41% chance to find a bullion and I currently have 48 small bullions sitting in my convoy. On an average match against the risen that I have summoned via a reeking box, I may find 4-6 small bullions AND I may get an additional 3-5 bullions due to the skill despoil. So for a reeking box that costs 500 gold, I'm potentially making a 10,000 profit. Do that a few times and you can buy all the master seals/second seals your heart desires!!!

**Is this game hard?**: It depends on your difficulty. If you farm like crazy and do tons of promotes/max out stats, then you are going to have a significant advantage when it comes time for endgame. Here are some fun rules to make the game harder:

1. No pairing up

2. If a unit falls below 15% hp, it cannot attack or move.

3. A unit can only hold two weapons at once. 

4. I cannot use second seals

5. I cannot have more than one class

Stuff like that changes the flow of the game.

If there is anything else you guys are unsure of or if I wan't clear let me know. /r/fireemblem is here to help!

Kellam x Nowi to produce a +7 DEF Nah  
Male MU (+DEF/-MAG) x Nah to produce Morgan  

  
Skill build will be:  

Limit Breaker (DLC)  
Ignis  
Aegis  
Pavise  
Renewal (Optional, can switch for a secondary activation skill like Astra/Luna, or extra stats, or anything you want)  


Max Morgan's stats, change her to Manakete, and you have the following stats (including Dragonstone+):  

64 STR
50 MAG
51 SKL
45 SPD
57 LUK
74 DEF
63 RES  


With an A/S-rank Paladin pair-up, this increases to:  

71 STR
56 MAG
58 SKL
52 SPD
60 LUK
81 DEF
66 RES  


Lastly, assuming you have a rally unit with Spectrum/Love/Mag/Spd/Def, this gives you a final stat of:  

77 STR
66 MAG
64 SKL
62 SPD
66 LUK
91 DEF
72 RES  


In other words, you have a 77 STR/62 SPD manakete (ensures double attack on everything outside of final DLC boss units)

64% chance to activate pavise, or aegis every hit to halve all incoming damage

64% chance per attack to activate ignis for +33 damage

-66% critical reduction, making enemy crits near non-existent (assuming they can even hit you with 126 avoid)

91 DEF, which is straight up RIDICULOUS (alternatively, switch rally def for rally res, this gives you 87 DEF/76 RES)  


I suggest Renewal as the last skill because you're rarely (if ever) going to take any damage due to the ridiculous defensive stats + pavise/aegis combo, and the 30% hp regen ensures you're at max every turn. You can always switch this out for another skill (Galeforce, Astra, Luna, AS+2, etc) if preferred. I don't take Armsthrift because Dragonstone+ can be purchased from the chapter 23 shop and you can fill your inventory with them, so durability is never an issue.",,False,self,t5_2t0cn,False,,,True,t3_19hhz6,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/19hhz6/how_to_make_a_super_manakete_morgan/,

Well, I was half-right.

I tried using the super cheesy Armsthrift 20 Might Aversa's Night Sorc Tank with Sol tactic, and that worked out great until about chapter 17.  That's when Counter just got stupid.  Then it dawned on me, ""There's a stupidly easy way to bypass counter forever.""  I made MU a Sniper.

All other weapon types have 1-2 range weapons, including a physical damage sword (Ragnell) which is a series first as a generic legendary weapon.  People avoid Snipers because it feels like a waste to not be able to counter-attack in most modes.  Well, enter Lunatic+ where not counterattacking makes the entire game easy-mode if you are appropriately geared and leveled.

My final build when ripping through the final chapters (most are ""Defeat the Commander"") was Pass (Very important), Armsthrift (Because I'm cheap), Sol, Limit Breaker, All Stats +2.

Are you a tactician with mad strategies and skills?

How about we have a contest to see who exactly is a top notch Grandmaster!

This is...





The Fire Emblem: Awakening Draft Challenge
-----
-----

Each challenge will have 4 people vying for Grandmaster. The goal is to complete the game with the least amount of turns with an army of of your choosing (Chrom, Avatar, and 7 others + their children). There is no limit to the number of people who can join, but each challenge will be limited to 4 people at a time, so first come first serve.

**General Rules**

*Drafting*

* Each person will take turns drafting characters (see below)

* Turn order is determined by RNG

* Turn order will go 1&gt;2&gt;3&gt;4&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1...

* There is a 12-hour wait limit for drafting, so don't worry if you aren't able to access Reddit during certain times

* If you draft a mother, you also draft her child

* You MUST recruit units you have drafted

* Recruiting children is optional as it will add to your turn count

* Recruiting nondrafted units is optional, but be aware that some maps require you to save them (*Chapter 15* comes to mind)

*Battles*

* This challenge shall be played on **Hard/Classic**

* You may only use characters you have drafted

* Using undrafted characters in a battle or pairing up with undrafted characters will result in a **5 turn penalty** per usage 

* You can move undrafted characters out of the way and trade items if needed, but you will get a penalty even if they're 
attacked

* You do not have to recruit characters you have not drafted, and they will not add to your turn count

* When you unlock the preparation screen, you must bench your undrafted units

* You may not use DLC/Spotpass/Skirmishes, whether for battling, recruiting, getting extra skills, or shopping

* You are allowed to buy anything you want from wandering merchants and shops

*Paralogues*

* Non-children Paralogues (1-4, 17) are MANDATORY and must be played within two chapters it appears or else you will get a **20-turn penalty** for each chapter you skip it

* In *Paralogue 1*, if you are able to keep Donnel alive, you will receive a **5 turn reward** (If you have not drafted him, you do not need to move him at all)

* In *Paralogue 2*, if you are able to keep Anna alive, you will receive a **5 turn reward**

* In *Paralogue 3*, if you are able to keep the villagers alive, you will receive a **1, 3, or 5 turn reward** depending on how many you save

* In *Paralogue 4*, if you are able to keep Anna alive, you will receive a **5 turn reward** (This applies whether or not you have drafted Anna)

* In *Paralogue 17*, if you are able to keep Tiki alive, you will receive a **5 turn reward** (This applies whether or not you have drafted Tiki)

*Avatar*

* You cannot get S-rank for Chrom/Avatar (F)

* If Chrom does accidentally marry Avatar (F), you are not allowed to pair up and cannot use Lucina

* Avatar will be limited to 3 basic classes + Tactician

* Morgan's available classes include Tactician, Avatar's partner's base class, and 2 basic classes (Yes, this means if you are planning to go for children, be mindful who you marry or else you might lose a class for Morgan or reroll a new class. [Here is an example](http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/191euy/fire_emblem_awakening_draft_challenge_signups/c8k0hj5))

* The classes for both characters will be chosen by RNG

* The gender of Avatar can be locked by the classes chosen (If Avatar gets Pegasus Knight first and Fighter second, Avatar will be locked to female)

* You may use the promoted classes of these certain basic classes


*Misc.*

* Event tiles are useable

* Barracks are useable

* All items/weapons NOT OBTAINED from DLC/Spotpass/Skirmishes are all available to use

* You may only attain S-ranks between drafted characters or else you will suffer a **10 turn penalty**

* Resets ARE allowed, but you get a **1 turn penalty** (does not apply to ""Game Over"" resets)

* If an undrafted unit dies, you get a **1 turn penalty** (does not apply to non-recruited units)

* If a drafted unit dies, you get a **3 turn penalty** for every chapter after the unit dies

* If Chrom/Avatar dies and you have a ""Game Over"", you get a **10 turn penalty**

* Once you begin to write your turn log, you MUST CONTINUE THAT GAME. You are allowed to reset individual chapters, but not an entire game. Doing so will result in **IMMEDIATE DISQUALIFICATION**

* This is done on an honor system, meaning participants MUST keep track of their own turns and penalties, so please don't cheat so that we can have a good time

This post will be used for signups. I will be organizing people into 4-people groups. If you wish to compete in this challenge, make sure to start a new comment thread stating your intentions so I can easily find you. 

Each group will have their own separate posts that I will personally update to keep track of their turn count, Avatar/Morgan classes, and other information. There, I will do the drafting in a single comment thread. Each turn, just simply reply to the previous comment to select your characters. Each participant will start their own comment thread there to keep track of their turns. Participants can use any format to write as long as you mention the Chapter's number of turns and the overall number of turns. Make sure you update your comment instead of making a new comment so that we can keep things organized. I have a bit of OCD about organization, so if I feel things are getting out of hand, I will institute a **10-turn penalty**. 

Observers, please do not comment in the drafting threads. You may create a new comment thread or comment in the turn-count thread, but make sure to upvote the participants' stuff so it can be easily seen.

If you have questions or concerns, please feel free to ask!

Now, go out there and show me how amazing a Tactician you can be!

Also, to make this thing even more awesome, tell me which options you chose for Avatar so I can do something interesting.

I was very excited to learn that fact, so I downloaded an emulator and tried out the first Fire Emblem game released in NA, which was FE 7 for the GBA. 

I was completely shocked at the quality of the writing, the deep characters, and fantastic game play. I did not think such a level of strategy AND story telling was possible on a hand held console. Since it was made by Intelligent Systems, I felt safe in believing that the game play would not be disappointing, but wow... FE 7 told a story I would not forget for the rest of my gaming life. 

Literally a day later, after I finished FE 7, I bought a 3DS XL and FE:A. A day after that, I'm on my second playthrough.

1373478712.0,27,self.fireemblem,1i0s16,For all Fire Emblem Fans who love Advance Wars,GrilledCheeseDreams,41,14,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1i0s16/for_all_fire_emblem_fans_who_love_advance_wars/,"I apologize in advance for not really staying on topic for this subreddit, unfortunately the Advance Wars community is not as large as the Fire Emblem one and I wanted to reach a bigger audience. 
I was thinking today about the differences between Advance Wars and Fire Emblem, two of my absolute favorite games on the GBA and the DS. I love them for different reasons. Advance Wars for its crazy powers, large scale battles, and the fun ""all out war"" aspect of it. Fire Emblem on the other hand is more personal to me. I get engaged with the characters, the battles actually mean something to me because I don't know if my favorite character will make it out alive. That is what set these games apart from the relative shallowness of Advance Wars series. Though with the 3DS and the success of Awakening, I am hoping that their will soon will be an Advance Wars game in the works, though it will have to go toe-to-toe with the juggernaut of Fire Emblem to prove its worth. 
So here's my idea on how Advance Wars could really succeed on the 3DS, by having the stories and battles be more engaging while still keeping that balls to the wall craziness and epic battles. 

-First, get the CO system and powers back to the original series, just make sure to tone them down so they're not so OP (looking at you Hawke/Sami)crazy 1-day capturing bitch........... 

-Second, incorporate the CO system of Days of Ruin/Dark Conflict. Only instead of having your CO go out into the field, you'll have a  ""squad leader"" or ""special forces"" unit. These will have permadeath, like Fire Emblem. They will be full characters in the story, and will have special skills on their own. Kinda like CO skills only not as game changing. For example, having a saboteur character that can disable a factory for a few turns. Or a sniper that could hide himself in the mountains and pick off infantry.  They can either be stationed in a unit, or put on the front by themselves. Alone they can provide better individual bonuses and powers, but in a unit they can boost the stats of those fighting around them. They are the elite units who will need to be played strategically. You will have them fighting next to the more expendable troops, but you do not want to loose them. CO's will be able to build relationships and work better with certain secondary units, so you need to find out which combinations work best with your fighting style.

-Third, balance the story. I mean, people are dying!!! It gets a little weird when in the middle of a world war suddenly you're having a tea party on the battlefield. You don't need to go all out like DoR/DC, but just make sure that the story has some amount of seriousness to it. Maybe the story could have a time skip or a new universe to explore. Wars world is fun, but I really want to meet some new and exciting COs on the battlefield.

So I was just wondering what other people would think of these ideas. Feel free to add or critique anything!!

I looked around, saw the bus already pulling away.

I carry my 3DS with me everywhere. At work in my back left pocket (unless I need to sit down, then it gets moved to my front right pocket). If I have 3 or 4 minutes I open it up and get a couple turns in. As work ends it gets shifted to the front left pocket of my jacket. Unfortunately today work was pretty rough so I spent the bus ride home resting. I guess it fell out of my jacket pocket.

First thing in the morning I'll call the transit lost and found...here's to hoping. But right now, I just feel a little lost. :(

Update: Called lost &amp; found. They don't log in the previous days items until 11 am, but a very nice lady took down my info and a description and said she'd call if they had it.

I want to see if we can find a community agreement on who the best parent for each child character is.

**Rules**:

1. Parents are not limited. I.e. The same parent can be an answer for any of the children. This is not an ""Ideal Pairings for a Playthrough"", but rather who is the ideal parent in a vacuum from the rest of the game. 

1. Because MU is the best parent for each child, they are ineligible. Instead, in a separate comment, you can post your ""MU Build"" for that child character.

1. Give your rationale for why that character is makes the best parent. Could be skills, stat mods, class sets, synergy or something else!

HOLY CRAP, if you second seal her (at the most) twice back into a Trickster before changing her into a Dark Knight so that she can fully get her skills, you are in for a wild ride. 

She'll already have the ability Lucky Seven, +1 Movement, and Acrobat (lets you walk over any surface as if it were a plain, this includes mountains, forests, stairs but not cliffs or the sky which is exclusive to airborne riders) by the time you're ready to upgrade her to the Dark Knight. Becoming a Dark Knight gives her plus TWO movement, since she's mounted, on top of her existing 7 movement, so that's mother fucking 9 movement. 9 movement and able to fucking dance all around the enimies over mountains with Acrobat? JACKPOT!!

Also, she'll get Slow Burn, so amazing with her Lucky 7 bro, lemme tell yah. And FINALLY: Lifetaker. YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS AMAZING DEAL WITH A STICK BRO. IT'D BE INHUMAN, YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR ASSAULT. I do not have my game with me currently, but I believe you can get Swordfaire as well, but regardless, if she's carrying a Levin Sword, she's UNSTOPPABLE.

And as a bonus, the best defense in the game!",inkWanderer,31,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1axvcm/the_most_powerful_attack_in_the_game_and_as_a/,"Well first of all, here's what I did before I thought it all through: [Check it out yo](http://i.imgur.com/DIxes93.jpg). Then I spend too much time on Serenes Forest and did ~~a bit of~~ way too much wholly useless theorycrafting, which I shall share below:


----------


Start by pairing Cherche and Vaike. Then have FeMU with +Strength/-whatever marry Gerome, for a Morgan (M) with a natural Berserker Strength cap of **61**. Just wait, it gets better.

An A support with any Warrior with more than 30 Strength adds 10. Give him a forged Hectors Axe that offers a combined Mt of 22. Then there's the obvious skills: 5 from Axefaire, 10 from aggressor, 10 from Limit Breaker, 2 from All Stats, and 2 from, uh, Strength +2. Total bonuses: **61**

So with just a buddy and some skills, we're looking at an attack rating of **122**. 

Now we can add some silly stuff. 4 from both Rally Spectrum and Strength, and an extra 2 from both Rally Love and Special Dance. I forgot to mention it's his birthday and he had a lovely surge of +4 Strength in the Barracks. Finally, he downs ~~some steroids~~ a strength tonic for a total bonus of **18** from outside sources, pushing us to **140**.

But then we're going to do something a *bit* extra. We'll take off Strength +2 in favor of Vengeance. Hah.

Once we drop poor Morgan's health to a mere 1, assuming he has any Skill at all (which he does, it's at somewhere in the low 40s, depending on his support bonuses and such), this will tack on a monstrous 39 extra attack for a ludicrous final attack rating of **177**.

**Edit:** As HiroariStrangebird and Lhyon have pointed out, I missed some stuff! Ignoring effective damage, we could also use a confection or HP tonic to add 3 more points to Vengeance. We also get +1 from an A-rank in Axes, and +1 more if the defender is using a Lance. That's **182** now, folks!


----------


Of course then I naturally got curious about how to create the best physical defense in the game. So here's that. I'll caveat by saying I'm going to ignore the Dragonskin skill, since there's no way to get it without hacking. 

Anyway. Start with Kellam and Nowi, for a very defensive Nah. Then MaMU with +Def/-Whatever will have a Morgan (F) with 61 base defense as a General. Grab Helswath and we're already beating the odds with **66**. Okay, a good start, but he still puts us in the hole for -111. Let's add some other stuff.

A suitably tanky General buddy offers +10 in support Defense. Sadly, there's not a -faire equivalent for us, but we do have Defense +2, All Stats +2, Limit Breaker, and Defender (woo). From skills and supports, we manage to scrape up an extra **23**, for a running total of **89**. Hey look, we're sub-three digit damage now! 90 damage ain't so bad, walk it off girl. 

The silly stuff is identical for defensive stats, so an extra **18** puts us at **107**. We've passed the threshold for surviving our idiotically massive superattack! I mean, assuming 80 HP we'll be surviving at just 10, but hey. The last step is standing on a Throne for 3 more defense, leaving us with a total of **110**. 

Now that we know the maximum Defense we can get, we can calculate the effect of Pavise. We're taking **67** damage, which we cut to just **33**. 

...unfortunately, Super Offensive Berserker Morgan (M)^^TM will be more than fast enough to double Super Defensive General Morgan (F)^^TM, so we end up taking 66 anyway. But hey! We survived! ^^Except ^^if ^^Morgan ^^gets ^^a ^^crit, ^^then ^^we're ^^totally ^^fucked.

Or, y'know, SOBM(M)^^TM could pull a Dual Strike with his buddy. Which is statistically far more likely than SDGM(F)^^TM triggering a Dual Guard.

The ones I can help with for sure are Nowi and Vaike since the voice actors for these characters say their names during battle. 

""Enter the Vaike""

""Nowi wins.""

Some I can only speculate at include Cherche, but I agree with /u/BTBAMfreek from the Cherche thread earlier that her name is meant to be french, so naturally you would pronounce it ""Share-sh"" Likewise Noir is french for black, so Noire's pronunciation would be ""Nwar.""

If there are any other names with ambiguous pronunciation and you're curious to know what the correct one might be, feel free to post it here and we can figure it out.

Possible Fathers: Frederick, Virion, Stahl, Vaike, Kellam, Donnel, Lon'qu, Ricken, Gaius, Gregor, Libra, Henry

**Rules**:

1. Parents are not limited. I.e. The same parent can be an answer for any of the children. This is not an ""Ideal Pairings for a Playthrough"", but rather who is the ideal parent in a vacuum from the rest of the game. 

1. Because MU is the best parent for each child, they are ineligible. Instead, in a separate comment, you can post your ""MU Build"" for that child character.

1. Give your rationale for why that character is makes the best parent. Could be skills, stat mods, class sets, synergy or something else!

The game is pretty good in a lot of ways, but strikes me as being very flawed, and I'd love to start up some healthy discussion. The notable issues I had with the game:

1. Story. Disjointed, Valm arc was awful, none of the main antagonists were particularly fleshed-out during the campaign

2. Map layouts. Not nearly as creative or strategically designed as past titles; most maps are open fields with little to no tactical terrain to take advantage of

3. Lack of difficulty. This game is pitifully easy, even on Lunatic (where a Shaman Avatar can solo the game beginning around Chapter 6). A related issue is the lack of class or character balance: some units and classes are badly overpowered, while others lack much usefulness

4. Fanservice. No thank you

Of course, most of the time you have no choice in the matter, but that doesn't really make it much easier. So, my question to you is, out of all of the enemies you've killed, which one did you regret the most?

For me, I'd have to go with General Shiharam from Path of Radiance. Facing off against a protagonist's father is is not too uncommon as a plot device (ahem, Darth Vader), and it's usually a pretty difficult moment. That moment is made all the more difficult when the father in question turns out to be a decent guy (one of the *only* decent guys in his entire country at the time) who's being forced into a really awful situation by his superiors. The fact that I used Jill (his daughter) as one of my top units just made the whole thing suck even more (thank goodness for her A level support with Mist though).

Honorable mention goes to Levail. All of his interactions with Zelgius throughout the game made me think he was a pretty cool guy, and also made me wonder about the possibility of him becoming an ally at some point, but no such luck, instead I was forced to kill him. (ok, I didn't *have* to kill Levail, I could have taken out the Black Knight sooner rather than leaving him for last, but Levail wasn't exaclty going to gift-wrap that wishblade for me now was he?)

It was a great game and I really enjoyed playing it (of course I did, it's Fire Emblem), but I'm gonna go ahead and skip straight to the good part. The Final Chapter. (oh, and umm, there are a few Sacred Stones spoilers ahead. Nothing really major plot-wise that isn't especially marked, but just be warned.)

---------------------------

So I got through the first part of the final chapter with relative ease (the sniper gorgon's were a pain, but I did some counter sniping with Bolting and it all worked out great).  I even dealt the final blow on [FE8](#s ""Lyon"") with Eirika for drama's sake. Of course I knew it didn't end there, and I was ready for it.

Enter part 2 of the final chapter and I spend the first turn positioning all of my troops slightly closer to the Demon King so they may all be within attacking range for next turn. Then he goes ahead and summons a bunch of reinforcements haphazardly all over the map (nothing I hadn't really expected, but I wasn't *particularly* extactic about fighting more dragon zombies). So I delay my assault on the Demon King by one turn to dispatch a few of the baddies he brought along with him (this is where it gets good)...

Begin turn 3. HE FREAKIN' **MOVES!** The giant monstrosity that (graphically) takes up multiple tiles, and was so perfectly and symmetrically placed on the map in such a way that might suggest that he would stay there forever **MOVES!!!** And at Ross no less! And then he *attacks!* So the hit rate was about 75% I think, and he was attacking from a range while I had Garm (S rank axe) equipped, so no counter attacking for me. He hits me of course, and leaves me with 9 health (I remember this part quite vividly, also it was about 30 minutes ago). And *this* is where I proceed to pretty much lose my shit...

Immediately following that huge attack, a wight walks right on up to Ross with a killing edge in his hand. As soon as the battle starts I do a quick check of the hit rate. 45%. Now I've done some research and I know about the 2 rng system, and ""true hit"" and how 45% is actually lower than displayed, but still, those are odds I wouldn't take. Also, he's set to do 9 damage. **9 DAMAGE!!!** (in case you forgot, that's exactly how much health I had at that very moment). So he marches on up to me and attacks... and *misses* (whilst I have about 7 separate heart attacks in the span of 1 second). I think I might have actually started jumping up and down while Ross blew him to pieces with Garm.  Of course then I realized that killing him might have been a bad thing because now that spot is vacant... but not for long. A hellhound promptly walked on over and took the wight's place. The battle starts and I'm a little bit too... *ahem* [preoccupied](http://i.imgur.com/EwgSf8T.gif) to check the hit rates as I usually do, but I notice that he would do 5 damage... and that's exactly what he does, right before I gore him with Garm. Then the *other* hellhound decides he wants a shot, but this time he is only able to do 3 damage... which he does (for those of you not keeping score at home that leaves me with exactly **ONE FREAKIN' CLICK OF HEALTH!!!!!!!**). So then it's over, right? *Nope!* There's still a centaur (Maelduin) on the map with a longbow. He loads up and gets ready to try for a shot that would do 5 damage, (maybe it's just me, but I'm pretty sure he shot in slow motion) then [PRAISE JESUS HE MISSES!](http://i.imgur.com/Bgv8qeq.gif)

So then I wrap it up pretty quickly giving the Demon King 2 shots from Ephraim's Siegmund (doing a buttload of damage), and a good hit with Myrrh, then go and heal everybody with the S level staff just for fun, and go in for the killing blow with Ross wielding Garm, and *damn* did it feel good!

tl;dr: **ROSS IS BOSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

I conducted an experiment since I assumed most of you wouldn't just take my word for it, and rightly so.


I used my limit broken Chrom!Inigo for this, with a skill of 59, paired with S support Noire he gets 66 skill, and with rightful king he has a theoretical 76 % proc rate assuming having the weapon on top of the skill has no effect. If the sword were to act as a second ""roll"" of Sol then with Sol having a 24% fail rate and a second 76% proc rate then it would be 76 + ..24x76 = about a 95% proc rate

While having both the sword and skill equipped, I recorded only attacks that the enemy initiated, not on my turn. and Inigo proced Sol 39 out of 50 attacks, or 78 %. so it would seem that having both the weapon and skill doesn't affect the proc rate.

On to the next test. this time only recording attacks that I initiated. and Lo and behold, he proced sol 48 out of 50 times equaling a 96% proc rate.

tl;dr when initiating the attack a weapon skill acts as a second roll, but when counterattacking it doesn't take effect.",,False,self,t5_2t0cn,False,,,True,t3_1i7op1,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1i7op1/skill_proc_answers/,

Morgan is speculated to come from a different timeline, as said by a few characters and referenced at the end of the game. Somehow, however, if Morgan has siblings, her siblings remember Morgan despite them being from Lucina's timeline.


The reason for this is probably because in the ""future is in ruins"" timeline, Morgan exists, but he/she did not go with the rest of the children to the past.


I only said this to clear any confusion, that isn't my theory.


My theory is that our Morgan is from the ""fixed"" timeline. The timeline where Grima is put to sleep/killed. There are a couple reasons for this. Morgan doesn't remember the future in ruins. Morgan also seems to remember an older version of her father, and they were together shortly before she got sent into the past.


Not sure how exactly time travel works in this series (worldline, probably), but I'm pretty sure Morgan is from the ""fixed"" timeline. Unless Grima was prevented from being awaken, Morgan would have never been able to be with her father. I suppose you could argue that she was from a different worldline that also happened to stop Grima, but seeing the whole ""destiny"" was that the MU would become Grima, I think it is safe to say that the ""fixed"" timeline is unique in its prevention of Grima.


Another piece of evidence that isn't really based within the plot is the epliogue. Morgan's epilogue (unless you get extra paralogue characters like Tiki, I think), mentions the whole thing about her being from a different timeline than the others. 


The thing is, why even bother mentioning that? It is already said within the game. As I went with the destruction ending, I saw the cutscene with Chrom and Lissa, which is right after Morgan's epilogue. Because of the mention of the fairly pointless fact, followed by the whole ""and so they lived hapily ever after"", I think it is hinting towards Morgan being from that timeline.

I've been (mostly) following the Fire Emblem since it released in the US in '03. I consider Fire Emblem (the GBA game) as one of my top five favorite games of all time. I played through Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn and found myself a bit underwhelmed by the experiences. And I've since come to acquire Sacred Stones via the Ambassador program.

Having played through Fire Emblem three times, I still hold it to be the best I've played in the series. I realize there's a near-consensus that Awakening is the best in the series and I plan on picking it up when it's in stock.

**But primarily**, I want to ask you guys if the non-US releases are worth playing, or hold up against the US releases. I.e., the GBA Fire Emblem with Roy, the sequel to Shadow Dragon on the DS, and all of the SNES games.

**Edit: On the legal/moral gray areas of playing the games:

**I'll probably end up purchasing a japanese cart on ebay, and then download/patch the rom. The really sad part is that Intelligent Systems/Nintendo won't see a dime of my money, any way you cut it. It probably doesn't make business sense for them to translate the games themselves, and release them in the west, but I really wish they would. I always try to directly support the games I love, but it's impossible in this case. I guess the only thing I can really do is pay it forward by purchasing their future games.

In this game, the DLC comes in the form of bonus chapters which provide, at least after the first few, a greater and deeper challenge to players (Ike's one is described by those who've played it as one of the hardest in FE history), available at the equivalent of two to five US dollars per chapter package.  Their main draw is that all but three of the DLC chapters feature a total of 121 characters from the preceding 12 games as enemies or neutral allies, and each of these chapters offers one prior main character as a playable reward, redesigned with new artwork; some chapters offer other rewards, like items to teach powerful new skills and promote to two new classes.  [Serenes Forest](http://www.serenesforest.net/fe13/dlc.html) goes into far greater detail on the matter.

A person on Nico Nico Douga, the ""Japanese YouTube"", has been recording a series of great-quality videos of the DLC chapters in action.  I've gathered up a set of links to the full series, and now that what appears to be the last one has been released, I thought they could do with being posted here.  As an incidental benefit, these also provide a fantastic look at the gameplay of FE13 at its most intense and intricate; I'm not sure on which difficulty mode they were playing the chapters.  The later chapter playthroughs are long enough that they had to be divided into parts.  Note that **[you will require a Nico Nico Douga account](https://secure.nicovideo.jp/secure/register) to view them**; [the usual workaround](http://www.mmcafe.com/nico.html) doesn't work with these videos.  Obviously, **expect spoilers concerning main-story playable characters**.

1368233132.0,16,self.fireemblem,1e3qjs,Hello redditors of /r/Fireemblem! I'm here today to see how many of you would be interested in a forum based Fire Emblem rpg. (Details inside),Kennori,30,14,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1e3qjs/hello_redditors_of_rfireemblem_im_here_today_to/,"Hello everyone, I'll just jump to the point. A small group of people and I would like to see if anyone is interested in joining us. 

The premiss of this RPG is to allow a Player to Join a Clan/Guild/Country and then create a unit for the group they're in for them to control. Using your unit, you can participate in Clan battles, Fight pre-made units/monsters in Arenas, or Fight in Battle royals for exp, gold or loot. You can think of this as a Forum Based Fire Emblem Dungeons and Dragons, using the same formulas and items and such from the games. We've done this before and those who participated enjoyed it, and trust me, when we have the system refined for FE: Awakening standards, I feel you all will enjoy it as well. 

Like I said, I'm only here as a messenger to see if there's an interest. If there are any questions please feel free to ask. If this is inappropriate for this subreddit, or I have crossed any lines, please let me know and apologies in advance.

EDIT: Well, it's not a program or anything, it's all forum based. What will happen is one of the Admins will create a post that will guide you through character creation, where you get to choose your class and starting stats (which are allotted like Fallout or D&amp;D). During creation, the post will guide you though how Battles are decided and handled. (you'll learn how the game calculated Damage, Number of Hits, Hit chance and crit chance, then how to apply them based on your character vs who ever you're fighting.)

Then after your character is approved, you can begin to level up and such by Fighting in an Arena Sub-forum (where there will be multitudes of different NPCs for you to fight. After you choose to fight something, you proceed through the battle like in the Arena of the Fire Emblem games, one constant battle till a victor is decided.)

At high enough levels, there will be a Battle royal for you to participate in. Depending on how strong and Well built your character is, the further you'll go and the better rewards you'll receive.

Eventually, we'll introduce Clan/Guild battles or Wars depending on the story. Where your Groups Tactician will communicate with the rest of your group and formulate a battle ground placements and army movement, and proceed with battle. If a character levels up during a battle, the Tactician will get back to you to find out how you level up, or what weapon you'd like to use if there's a choice.

Last time I was involved there where no deaths (if a unit died, it just retreated.)

Mind you, this ALL may change, or it may stay the same.

It's not ENTIRELY text based... there will be maps for main story battles. One of the funnest parts of this is designing how your character looks.

Combat on maps would go like this...

Lets say Nation 1 is fighting against an NPC Group (Monsters/Bandits/ect):

A tactician from Nation one will confer with the Nations leaders and choose who to use for the battle among the units available for their Nation. Place the units, then the Nation themselves talks among each other for the first move. Once everything is agreed on, then The tactician edits the map to move everyone (or has someone else with Photoshop/Gimp move them) Then update the image.

Another Tactician will control the NPC's and move them accordingly to whats happening, and update the map.

This occurs until battle unfolds...

Lets say a Myrmidon for Nation 1 wishes to move to a square adjacent to a Risen Mercenary.

The controlling tactician will then calculate battle stats and odds between the Myrmidon and Merc, then roll several d% to determine what happens in the battle. Much like the game only one turn of events will Happen. (So the Myrm will get like, 2 hits in, and the Merc will get one) then that players turn ends and the Tactician continues on with the next person.

This process ends until one side becomes the victor.

The beginning phases may happen over the course of a single day, however when battles occur, there may only be 1 turn each for both sides a day. This can be sped up depending on how much control a player wishes to have over their character during a Map event. This scenario can also be applied to Nation versus Nation battles. However a Neutral Tactician will be present to over see the game by rolling the d%~~

TL;DR Do you like D&amp;D with Map battles? Yes? Do you like fire Emblem? Yes? Do you Enjoy Role Play? Yes? Then this is for you. If you said no to two of the three questions then this isn't for you.

Speaking of Map Battles, I'm going to look into using Maptools for Event battles. 

Thanks for taking the time to read :3


One of the Admins controls a forum where this will be hosted at (it'll have it's own area for this) When I feel comfortable with the amount of people interested, and the forum is created, I'll create a new post in /r/RPG_Gamers and /r/Fireemblem with a link to the forum.

FINAL EDIT: Thank you everyone for showing interest, We're beginning work on revamping the old system to FE:A standard. I'll personally Message everyone who left a comment, as well as make a second post when The forum is ready.

Well this got me thinking about if there are any clues to what form of timeline it was, then it hit me. He/she says they were with the Avatar who taught them and such, which would be impossible for the children timeline, since the MU would end up killing Chrom and such. 

This means that Morgan would have to come from a future where this didn't happen.

There is also the fact you can marry children characters if you so decide, which would result in a Morgan. And this would also mean that the MU would have met the child character at some point.

This means that (likely) the child character would have to come from the future, and then meet the Avatar. 

So quick recap: Morgan is from a future where the Avatar does not kill Chrom, and has met a child character.

Which timeline does the MU do this in? that's right. The one you are playing in.

**TL;DR: Morgan is from the future where you succeed.**

As an idiot, the sheer number of options and possibilities and *things* in Awakening overwhelms me and is far too complicated for my below-average sized brain to handle.  

I've been a huge fan of Fire Emblem ever since the first one released in the States, and I've beaten them all multiple times, except for Shadow Dragon, because that shit sucked.  But I never got to a higher difficulty level than normal, so I never really had to think too hard about which characters to use on my team or how to min-max them, etc etc.  I have literally never bothered with optimizing supports, I always just hit the ""support"" option whenever it became available, not really caring who was supporting who and at what level.  I do know the basics of FE; don't promote characters until they hit 20, the seemingly weak villager turns out to be mad strong (Ross was my favorite unit in 8), don't use Jeigan, and all that stuff.

So I got super pumped about Awakening, but then I start playing it, and almost right off the bat it's too much for my meager intelligence to handle; I'm expected to make my avatar excel in one area and suck in another?  Ohgodohgodohgod too much pressure.  And then I start reading about how everyone can be multiple classes, and you can go right back to level one and start again and all these new skills and reclassing, and holy shit they can have kids and you have to make sure the parents are supported right so you can get the best kid and you have to figure out which skills and classes to pass on...

I nearly had an aneurysm just typing that out.  Basically, I love Fire Emblem, and I do like to min-max to some degree, but there's just so much stuff to worry about in this one, I don't know how to go about it.  I liked the old style, where everyone could promote once (or twice) and it was just so much easier to understand.  I guess I just need some help figuring out the best way to optimize my party, which units are worthwhile, how to reclass, which skills I need, how to support and get the best kids, and whether or not all that is actually stuff I need to bother with if I'm just playing on normal, or if I can just play willy-nilly.

It can be from older games, or fe13, or both, but what I was thinking was this kind of format: Every other day or so I release a set of threads, and at the end of the set of threads we would do a comparison.

The first one I have planned is hero, then warrior, then swordsmaster. Then after those were done, I'll post a thread for discussion which class/skill we're discussion over the other, what situation they're good in, etc. I hope you guys have a lot of fun with these! Without any further ado, let us begin!

**Class Discussion Thread: Hero**

The hero class is a promotion of Fighters and Mercenaries. They wield Swords and Axes. Statswise, they have more strength than Swordsmasters, but less speed, and vice versa for warriors. Typically they're considered the more balanced class.

Heroes learn two skills: Sol, and Axebreaker. 

Sol is the skill that they learn at level five. It allows them to recover half of the damage they deal out in HP, and it's chance to activate is based on your skill as a percentage. Sol is a solid skill, allowing some healing while the hero deals damage. It works for every form of damage, which makes it a great skill to pass down to children.

Axebreaker is one of the typical breaker skills, and is learned at level 15. It  increases the user's Hit Rate and Evasion by 50% when the enemy is equipped with an Axe. This skill is great in story mode, making dodging those low-skill fighters even easier.

What do you guys think of this class? What are its weaknesses? Its strengths? What skills can you pass on to improve this class?

Most places use the term Stat Max, I have no idea why I use the term Stat Cap, but I do, but you can consider the terms cap and max to be interchangeable

----------------------------

There are two kinds of stat caps, class stat caps, and character stat caps.

**Class Stat Cap**

A class stat cap is the maximum in a stat your class will allow you have, and is the same for all characters. 

For example, a berserker has a Str cap of 50, while a swordmaster has a Str cap of 38.  Generally, stat caps of basic classes are much lower than the caps of advanced classes

Class stat caps are the main things that people will be looking at when people are determining which class will be a character’s ending class.  If I want MU to have high Str to OHKO, I may go through a bunch of classes to pick up the skills I want, but end in an advanced class with a high Str and Skl cap for the higher base damage and crit chance.

**Character Stat Cap**

A character stat cap is a modifier to the class stat cap that is unique to each character.  This modifier is added onto the class stat cap to determine the actual stat cap for a character.

For example, Vaike’s Str character stat cap is +3.  This means that no matter what class Vaike is, his strength cap for that class is 3 higher.  

Using an earlier example: 

Vaike as a swordmaster will have a Str cap of 38 (swordmaster) + 3 (Vaike’s modifier) for a total of 41. 

On the other hand, Vaike’s Lck cap is –1, so whatever his class cap for Lck is, it will be one lower.

This is mainly what sets characters apart and makes them unique, a Vaike fighter will always have more max Str and lower max Res than any non-DLC generation I fighter, and Miriel sage will always have more max Mag than any other G I sage.  Granted most of these mods for generation I characters are not that extreme.  They range for +3 to –3, which honestly should not matter unless you are a stat crunching minmaxing power gamer like me.

**Stat Caps and Children**

This is where things get interesting, and stat caps are one of the big things that set generation II characters apart from the previous generation.  A child inherits the sum of the character specific stat caps of BOTH parents, and then gets a bonus +1 to every stat.  For example:

Nowi has a Str cap of +1 and a Mag cap of +1.

Vaike has a Str cap of +3 and a Mag cap of –2.

This means that if they have a child, the child will inherit a character Str cap of 5! [3 (Vaike) + 1 (Nowi) + 1 (Bonus)].  

The child will also have a character Mag cap of 0. [-2 (Vaike) + 1 (Nowi) + 1 (bonus].

Thus, this is one of the reasons generation II have the potential to be much greater than their parent’s generation.

**Misc**

If you marry MU to a generation II character, Morgan will not get a +1 bonus, because one of his/her parents already got a bonus, however, they will get the bonus from MU’s caps.  

So if you marry Sully to Chrom, Lucina will get Sully and Chrom’s caps +1.  Then if you marry Lucina to MU Morgan will inherit Lucina and MU’s caps WITHOUT the +1.

- Tedious Mode - Classic;
Complete the game on the hardest difficulty setting.

- Nuzlocke Mode - Classic;
You may not reset the game upon losing a character. If you recruit several characters during one mission (excluding chapter one), you may only use one of them, the others must be sacrificed. Best method for this is to trade their items and throw them towards enemies.

- Opposites Mode;
Complete the game after turning every possible physical class into a spellcaster class, and vice versa. Tactician must stay a Grandmaster.

- Support Mode;
Complete the game and build every single support up to maximum.

- Nostalgia Mode;
Recruit several characters from other FE games, such as Marth and Eirika, and complete the final mission using a team of only these characters.

- Friendless Mode;
Complete the game without levelling up any supports.

- Build An Army Mode;
Complete the game with every character changed into the same class line.

- Spectator Mode;
You may only move Chrom manually, once Chrom is moved you must ""Auto-End"" the turn to place the rest of your units.

- Beast Mode;
You may only use classes that involve a beast or dragon. e.g. Taguel, Manakete, Cavalier, Wyvern Lord, Pegasus Knight.

- Man Mode;
The opposite of beast mode, you may not use any classes involving a beast or dragon.

- Sexist Mode;
You may only use one gender. If you choose female, you may still use Chrom due to inability to deselect him.

- 100% Mode
You must recruit every single character in the game, DLC included, and raise them all to their final stage at maximum level. You must complete every support, and spec every weapon available to each character to maximum. You must complete the game without losing a character.

- ""Wish I Was You"" Mode;
Upon building maximum support with two units, you must swap their classes, if possible. e.g. Virion becomes a Cavalier and Stahl becomes an Archer. exceptions include Manaketes, Taguel, and Chrom.",,False,self,t5_2t0cn,False,,,True,t3_1gkxrt,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1gkxrt/fire_emblem_awakening_challenge_modes/,

1. ~~Because MU is the best parent for each child, they are ineligible. Instead, in a separate comment, you can post your ""MU Build"" for that child character.~~ Post your asset/flaw for your build. If you use a child character as Morgan's parent post their parent as well. Because this involves MU, post why you think Morgan's sibling would benefit from MU as well.

1. Give your rationale for why that character is makes the best parent. Could be skills, stat mods, class sets, synergy or something else! Post your favorite build as well!

The Swordsmaster is the promotion of the Myrmidon. They wield exclusively swords. Statwise, they have one of the lowest Strength caps, coming in at 38, which is just above dark fliers and tricksters. They also have relatively low Defense and a mediocre Resistance cap. However, they also have the highest base Speed cap in FE13, tying with the assassin at 46 Speed. This makes them rather fragile while being hard to catch. 

They have several weaknesses, including weapon triangle rigidity and lack of effective ranged capabilities and movement. (unless you have a decent amount of Magic) However, they make up for this with their stellar damage output.

Swordmasters learn two skills: Astra and Swordfaire. They also learn the skill Vantage as a myrmidon. (This skill is fairly useful, so I'll be talking about this one too.)

Vantage is a skill Myrmidons learn at level 10. It allows them to attack first during enemy turns while their health is below 50%. This is a very strong skill that allows low health swordmasters to kill their attackers instead of being killed, and can often save their lives.

Astra is the Swordmaster's signature skill, learned at level 5. It allows them to attack 5 times for half damage. It procs off of a single attack, and has a Skill/2% chance to activate. Each attack can crit. This ability is countered extremely effectively by counter. The best way to deal with counter is with either ranged attacks or oneshotting the warrior. Astra deals a lot of damage in small enough increments to not instantly kill the warrior, which allows the warrior to get in more counter damage than he would be able to normally.

Swordfaire is the Swordmaster's final skill, learned at level 15. It adds +5 to Strength when using a Sword or +5 to Magic if a Levin Sword is used. This is a great skill for the Swordmaster. Since they only use swords, it effectively adds five to their strength cap and five to their magic cap to boot, making them a bit more effective. It's also great on other classes that could use the strength, like Assassins or Tricksters.

The Swordmaster is an incredibly powerful class overall, despite its lack of range or weapon capabilities. Additional defensive or healing skills like Lifetaker, Sol, or Pavise help a lot with their defensive issues against enemies with higher accuracy.

The next discussion thread will be a comparison of the Swordmaster, Warrior, and Hero Classes.

1344890717.0,15,self.fireemblem,y5wgz,list of the best romantic supports in Blazing Sword,ItWillAllBeMine,18,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/y5wgz/list_of_the_best_romantic_supports_in_blazing/,"love this game and love the support system, but they could have added some bonuses to make the romance options more effective than the other support options like in previous games. pent and louise as well as bartre and karla are canon, so no explanation is necessary. 

1: Eliwood and Ninian - Not only does this make Roy 1/4 dragon, but the support conversations heavily support this romance more than his supports with fiora or lyn (he says he loves ninian versus saying that he is lyn's friend) and there is a special ending for this coupling. the plot itself also supports this ending

2: Hector and Lyndis - the constant banter is a huge example, but the extra conversations in the last few chapters seal the deal, especially when Hector says that he can't hit a woman that he has lost his heart to (after lyn tells him to hit her for treating him badly). Hector's supports with florina and farina are nowhere close to the chemistry he has with lyn.

3: Isadora and Harken - He even renews his proposal with their final support, so this one is obvious. 

4: Kent and Fiora - this support is actually hilarious to watch as both characters lose their formal tone. Her reaction to Sain's advances are what you would expect, and eliwood is better paired with ninian. On the flip side, lyn is better paired with hector. this leaves these two happily together. even farina says the two are similar.

5: Erk and Priscilla - aside from the fact that he is the only one who can marry her, erk's relationship with serra is not romantic in the slightest, mostly due to serra's annoying personality. In their second conversation, priscilla asks about his relationship with serra, and her apparent jealousy disappears after finding out that erk hates serra. 

6: Nino and Jaffar - thier love is explicitly stated in their last support, and their relationship is completely obvious to the player. nino's other option is erk, who seems to be quite nervous around her, but his feelings are not reciprocated. 

7: Dart and Farina - this one is a bit weird, but these two characters seem like the adventuring type. Farina's other choices are hector, who constantly tells her not to worry about money, and kent, who is kind of stoic and does not respond well to her. With both of them paired with better partners, Farina is free to pair with the free spirited dart. 

8: Lowen and Rebecca - she's obviously smitten as soon as he rode in to save her village from bandits, and kind of idolizes him. In her support with louise, she explains that there is someone she ""fancies"" and wants to become more ladylike in order to impress him. This is not needed for sain, who hits on every girl, or will, who she grew up with. This leaves Lowen, whose chivalry is passed on to their son Wolt, who is Roy's friend. 

9: Serra and Oswin - this one is perfect. he is the one that shuts her up in the first two supports, but when he apologizes in the third and tries to make her feel better, she pounces on the opportunity, even noting that they are only 14 years apart (WTF!?!). Matthew is her other option who notes that "" She's not bad looking... If only she would just...shut...up..."" I don't think he would have the patience to deal with her. 

honorable mentions (not romantic) that also exist as paired endings:
vaida and heath, raven and lucius, marcus and merlinus. 

My personal favorite support is between guy and karel. The master/apprentice relationship is heartfelt, and gives a hint to how karel became the saint of swords. the critical bonus also helps make both of them fun to use (15% swordmaster + 5% sword level S + 30% from killing edge + 14% from max skill of 29/2 + 7.5% from supporting each other = 71.5%).

Wouldn't it be interesting to have mounts have their own support levels?   It would make sense in game for the characters to tame their mounts especially with pegasus knights because they're supposed to share a very special bond with their pegasus.  The idea is that each person has to connect with their mount before becoming a mounted unit, so a knight would have to meet and get to know their horse/griffon/pegasus before having the ability to become a mounted unit.  Of course some starter characters would start out with their own.

This could help with mounted units being so powerful by making the base relationship (say d) able to be mounted but have worse stats because the rider and mount aren't 'in tune' yet.

**The Basics**  
Hello my fellow tacticians! I'm here to ~~start arguments~~ because I wanted to play out a what-if character VS battle scenario with our favorite lords! Sixteen heroes have been gathered and randomly put into a double-elimination style bracket.

Each matchup, *YOU* get to vote on who would win in a no-holds-barred arena battle between the two!  

***
**The Rules**  

1. Vote on who you think would win. Characters are assumed to be equal level in their most-promoted **canon class**. They also have access to any weapon they can wield in that class.  

2. Regular FE battle rules do not apply. No turn order, think of this as an actual battle between characters!  

3. Give rationale for your choice! Explain why you think one character would best the other in the comments! This can be anything, from stats to weapons to looks to best catchphrase.  

4. You have roughly 24 hours from the time each round opens to vote before the next round begins.  

5. EDIT **PLEASE** don't cheat. One response per person, please. I have already seen evidence of form-spamming. As master of the arena, I find this highly dishonorable.
***
Good luck, champions!

So here is my opinion on the ages of the different characters.

(18) Morgan and Nah: Nah tells Morgan that she is the same age as her. By both of their appearance, they seem to be the youngest characters in the game.

(19-20)* Most of the other children characters would be this age. This including Inigo, Brady, Gerome, Owain, Cynthia, Noire, Kjelle, etc. I would also say other young looking characters such as Donnel, Lissa, Maribelle or Youngest Avatars would be this age.

(21) This would be the age of Lucina since she would be the first born child character. This would also be the age of normal female avatar

(22-23) This would be the age of most of the normal parent characters. Such as Chrom, Sumia, Sully, Normal Male Avatar, and Older Female Avatar

(24-25) This would be the age Laurent after he went to the past. This might also be the age of Emmeryn, but i'm not sure.

(30-40) Gregor, Flavia, Old Male Avatar, and Basillo look way older than the rest of the characters in the game. So I would say that would be in their mid 30s.

(1,000-1,5000) Nowi

**Some of the children support conversations directly state that the parent character isn't that much older than them. This can be confusing since Gregor or Older Male Unit can be the father of Severa, which would make Severa older than she appears.

The rain

The freaking music! I hadn't really appreciated the score until this fight

and then it started to click with me, everything going though Choam and co.s head in this fight.

What I've always liked about sprite games is that sometimes its easier to imagine the cool fights going on, the battle animations are great, but in my head I could just imagine Choam running though the rain, stabbng enimies, screaming in anger, mud everywhere. I think the biggest reason that Choam can even talk to anyone after chapter 9 is because he unleashed so much of his anger in this fight.

The rest of the party is mostly a good level too, but MU is just killing EVERYTHING. I will move him away and enemies just want to piss him off it seems.

My usual strategy is to let weaker characters pick off the scraps of the stronger ones for EXP, and MU will be in the back in case things get hairy. Here is my usual thought process per battle.

1. ""Alright, let's send Gaius and Panne out. Doing good thus far.""
2. ""Uh-oh, that's a lot of units. Better send them back...""
3. ""Shit. This is no good. Go save them MU.""

Earth tremors riddled the ground with cracks. Two silhouettes appeared as the dust began to clear. Not even the massive audience made a sound as these two figures come into focus for all to see. 

It had been a furious fight. Hector had shown that he had learned much from his last match with Ike... he feinted, he whirled, he dodged and he tanked. Ike had to stay on a furious defensive. Both men traded blows and blocks for what has seemed like an eternity. At one point, the great hero of Tellius was even disarmed! It seemed like game over for the mercenary commander, but Ike once again proved that to compared to him, there is no equal fighter. One of the silhouettes lies on the ground.

The silence is broken by a single voice. The arena master beckons to the standing man.  
**“Finish him.”**  
And so it was that Ike, Leader of the Greil Mercenaries, and Hero of all of Tellius, raised his golden blade in triumph, and just as swiftly brought it down into the back of the face-down Hector. He grimaced one last time before fading away.

“Blast! I'll get you... next time... Ike...”

By the skin of his teeth, and with a mere 17 vote lead...

**Ike, The Hero of Tellius** has defeated Hector! Never once being defeated, Ike has *proven* his capacity as a peerless warrior! I suppose after you've slain a god, not much else can stop you!

Thank you guys so, so much! I remember back when I almost didn't post this thread thinking ""no, people will think this is stupid."" You guys certainly proved me the heck wrong! This tourney wouldn't have been possible without all of you, so from the bottom of my heart, thank you so, so much! What a wild ride it's been, and it's been an absolute pleasure serving as your humble arena master! 10/10 would run again!

Speaking of, a few users [brought up talk](http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1gi5fx/lordly_battle_royale_true_finals_clash_of_destiny/cakq0yl) of another tournament, perhaps villain-style. I need ample time to recoup - (Staying up late writing these things with work in the morning is fun!) - but drop your thoughts in the comments below!

Also, since I can't just have a post without some lively conversation, post which matchups between the 16 lords you would have liked to see but didn't get to in this bracket!

Beaten, scarred, bruised, and cut, neither man able to let their willpower fail. One man lifts his lance, the other, his axe. Letting loose a yell, Hector lunges forward, bringing the full force of Armads down on his opponent.

Ephraim was fast to move his lance in retaliation, but not quick enough. Armads had struck. Ephraim felt his heart race as the axe of legend cut deep into his chest. Bowing his head, he knew he had been beat. His opponent had fought like a demon, and no matter what he did, Hector would not go down. Ephraim smiled. It had been awhile since he had a fight this enjoyable. He looked up, speaking three last words before fading away:

""Good luck, Marquess.""

Lovely ladies and esteemed gentlemen, we have arrived at the *true championship finals!* After today, the world will know the might of the **True Lord Champion of Fire Emblem!**

But who will that champion be?  
Hector, a battle-scarred lord, fated to perish in battle for the sake of his friends?  
Or Ike, a war-weary hero, tempered by the wrath of an emotionless goddess?

Both men emerge from their respective sides of the arena, freshly healed and ready for battle. The earth shakes and the crowd roars. Arguing for your champion is more vital today than any other, as there can be only one winner!

The clash of destiny is upon us.  
Let the battle begin.  
Good luck.

**Today's Matchups**

Ike, Hero of Tellius Vs. Hector, Marquess Ostia!

***
**The Basics**  
Hello my fellow tacticians! I'm here to ~~start arguments~~ because I wanted to play out a what-if character VS battle scenario with our favorite lords! Sixteen heroes have been gathered and randomly put into a double-elimination style bracket.

Each matchup, *YOU* get to vote on who would win in a no-holds-barred arena battle between the two!  

***
**The Rules**  

1. Vote on who you think would win. Characters are assumed to be equal level in their most-promoted **canon class**. They also have access to any weapon they can wield in that class.  

2. Regular FE battle rules do not apply. No turn order, think of this as an actual battle between characters!  

3. Give rationale for your choice! Explain why you think one character would best the other in the comments! This can be anything, from stats to weapons to looks to best catchphrase.  

4. You have roughly 24 hours from the time each round opens to vote before the next round begins.  

5. **PLEASE** don't cheat. **One response per person**, please. I have limited control over form-spamming, so please keep this honor system honorable!

1. Parents are not limited. I.e. The same parent can be an answer for any of the children. This is not an ""Ideal Pairings for a Playthrough"", but rather who is the ideal parent in a vacuum from the rest of the game. 

1. Because MU is the best parent for each child, they are ineligible. Instead, in a separate comment, you can post your ""MU Build"" for that child character.

1. Give your rationale for why that character is makes the best parent. Could be skills, stat mods, class sets, synergy or something else!

One of the new Laguz tribes we see, the taguel are bunny tribe laguz. However, they've been the victims of a mass genocide, leaving Panne [FE13](#s and Yarne) as the last surviving taguels. For a class that transforms, their strength and speed (35 and 40, respectively) aren't too low. 40 is pretty good, factoring in beaststone+.

Their level 15 skill is very strong. Beastbane gives them super effective damage over beast types, which is much more useful than the niche wrymsbane. 

However, the main advantage the manaketes have over this class is range. However, I would say overall this class is stronger, while manketes are the tankier.

Also, has anyone noticed that no matter what class they are, panne and [FE13](#s Yarne) are always beast types?",,False,self,t5_2t0cn,False,,,True,t3_19ybul,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/19ybul/discussion_thread_of_the_day_taguel_class/,

Also, that fight will not change if you place a different unit with the same attack range in the arena instead.

Example: You place a Lance-using Cavalier into the arena and see you are going up against a pirate. Simply soft reset and place a unit that will use a sword instead. Entered with your Mage and are up against a Shaman? Reset and use a Monk instead!

Keep in mind that if you enter with a unit that has a different Attack range, the fight WILL change. If you reset when your Archer is matched with a mage and use a Shaman instead, the enemy wont be a Mage anymore.

This build has the basic game mechanics in it. I still need to build in the classes, Items and the Character List system.

As for what I have intended with the game, I want it to be a turn-based miniature strategy game, similar to Warhammer. It will use dice to replace that god-forsaken RNG, and has both Human and Beast soldiers to be selected, similar to the Tellius games.

But here's the important part that was posted
&gt;    What can you say about that crossover between Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei?

&gt;    - Hitoshi Yamagami: For a long time, I wanted to create a FE on ours times, on the real world. Imagine a Pegasus that comes from the sky and lands on the Building 109 of Shibuya, Tokyo. I always though that would be incredible. At the same time, I know it’s hard because of how FE is. I visited many companies to express these ideas. When I went to Atlus, I was told that Shin Megami Tensei together with Fire Emblem is what I wanted. So, I soon said that to Intelligent Systems and started this very special collaboration. Oops! I shouldn’t say that the game takes place in the real world. We haven’t announced it, right?
    - Others: Not really.
    - Masahiro Higuchi: Not yet.
    - Tohru Narihiro: Well, anyway, this is how the project was born, mixing these kind of ideas. I’m sure you’ll get to see the birth of a new franchise and interesting ideas. 

So, what I get from that is, modern setting, possibly real time gameplay and instead of all demons like in SMT the demons might be replaced with FE characters? 

I know there's not a lot to work with from this, but it's something and I'm so excited for the game I just want to talk about something with it. 

Also, what I'm hoping for can happen is that it will be turn based like FE, but whenever you go to fight someone it's either real-time, real-time turn (like chrono trigger), or turn like SMT devil survivor or Final Fantasy.

**Today's Matchups**

Ephraim Vs. Hector!!!  

***
**The Basics**  
Hello my fellow tacticians! I'm here to ~~start arguments~~ because I wanted to play out a what-if character VS battle scenario with our favorite lords! Sixteen heroes have been gathered and randomly put into a double-elimination style bracket.

Each matchup, *YOU* get to vote on who would win in a no-holds-barred arena battle between the two!  

***
**The Rules**  

1. Vote on who you think would win. Characters are assumed to be equal level in their most-promoted **canon class**. They also have access to any weapon they can wield in that class.  

2. Regular FE battle rules do not apply. No turn order, think of this as an actual battle between characters!  

3. Give rationale for your choice! Explain why you think one character would best the other in the comments! This can be anything, from stats to weapons to looks to best catchphrase.  

4. You have roughly 24 hours from the time each round opens to vote before the next round begins.  

5. **PLEASE** don't cheat. One response per person, please. I have limited control over form-spamming, so please keep this honor system honorable!

So, hi.
I wanted advice for my streetpass team, I wanted to make a troll team but this requires too much grinding for almost nothing since the units are only useful on Streetpass, so I've wanted to make a team inspired by a game I liked, and TF2 seemed like the easiest choice.

My team will consist of the 9 mercenaries + Saxton Hale, I want all character to have something in common with their TF2 counterparts, and skills to represent what the class can do in TF2, here's what I got so far:

Owain ( swordmaster ) as the Scout,
Skills: Galeforce, Pass, Lethality, Avoid +10, Movement +1
The skillset references the Scout gameplay: he's the fastest, and can be deadly if he manages to do a crit

MU, Build 3 ( berserker ) as the Soldier,
Skills: Sol, Rally Spectrum, Lethality. Sol refers to self-healing weapons, Lethality to crits and Rally Spectrum to buff banner.

Noire ( sorcerer ), or Henry ( DF ) as the Pyro,
Skills: Hex, Anathema and Tomebreaker for both, Luna and Bowbreaker ( Noire only ), Lethality ( Henry only ). The first 3 skills are a reference to the airblast that helps avoids most projectile, Noire's skills refers to the axetinguisher + degreaser combo and extend the list of projectile avoidable, Henry's lethality refers to the weapon combo already mentionned. The main advantage of Henry is the DF class, that allows him to use both fire tome and axe, but it's up to preference, they're both crazy enough to be pyromaniac on drugs.

Basilio ( hero ) as the Demoman,
Skills: Sol, Swordfaire, Pavise.
This skillset is a reference to the Eyelander/any melee weapon + Targe combo, Pavise replacing the targe

Gregor ( berserker ) as the Heavy,
Skills: Sol, Counter, Lethality.
Sol is a reference to the sandvich, the rest to the defensive gameplay of the Heavy, who deals and takes a lot of damage

Donnel as the Engineer ( any class, seriously, even villager ), Skills: armsthrift, every rally skill you can get with him, Sol.
They act as reference to the fact the the engineer never runs out of ammo and is more of a support type character with the dispenser.

Libra ( sage ) as the Medic,
Skills: Renewal, healtouch.
That's all I can think of, as a reference to the Medic's auto-healing and healing capability

Gaius ( assassin ) as the Sniper,
Skills: Lethality, Sol. Lethality refers to headshot, sol to the auto-healing some weapons offers, he will use a large bow.

Kellam ( assassin ) as the Spy ( and married to Lissa, for a reference to the Scout's mother ),
Skills : Pass, Locktouch, Lethality;

I was very excited to see the Bolt axe come back, and the Levin sword was awesome too, but then I saw the Shockstick...  Why does it have only one range? This was going to be staple for some of my bride classes, and I had Noire all set, with her innate high magic, when I realized it was solely one range... not 1-2.  It frustrated me even further because instead of impaling people with it a short range it still did the thunder magic style attack of the bolt axe and levin sword.

Annoyance two would be the lack of a magic based bow, with Noire (and a couple of reclassed units) having access to bows, but having such underwhelming strength caps to compensate.  And I know I could change Noire to a sorcerer, or a mage, but she is holding a bow in her picture, and I can't seem to bring myself to do it.

Finally I am constantly bugged by the fact that the levin sword/bolt axe/shockstick all have the same animation (no matter the range).  I thought that they could have implemented something better than when Owain activates astra with a levin sword he just repeats the same animation 5 times...  I guess the dev team had a lot on their hands, but couldn't the levin sword have had the wind animation, or the shockstick instead be the flame spear like before?

tl;dr:

Why does the shockstick have one range only?

Why Is there no Magic based bow?

Why is it the same animation for all the magic weapons, and why is it the same regardless of range?",,False,self,t5_2t0cn,False,,,True,t3_1f7nyo,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1f7nyo/magic_weapons_and_the_little_annoyances/,

Anyway, I was browsing SerenesForest to check out how some of the mechanics work because lots of the new stuff looks particularly cool. I think the thing I'm looking forward to most is the children (wow that sounds wrong), which look really interesting. Now, SF is great because it hides major plot spoilers, meaning I won't accidentally see anything that could ruin the story for me. I had noticed before how Lucina's picture had been hidden because it was a spoiler and didn't think much of it - she's the protagonist's daughter after all, of course she's important.

And then just now I was browsing again and it clicked. Why hide her picture? Why would that be a spoiler in itself? Unless it's someone we knew already. Someone in all the trailers. Someone hiding their identity with a mask. Someone who has a really feminine voice, looks like Chrom and arrived through a portal and CLAIMS TO BE MARTH.

So, that's my theory. I'm not going to look it up. I'm not even going to check this post until I've played the game. I may well be wrong but it just seems to fit so perfectly. Feel free to laugh at how wrong I am and tell me it's my fault for snooping around FE sites.

Some thoughts:

- Casual Mode:  AKA Shining Force mode!  Those of us who are OCD and hate restarting a fight a thousand times due to one unit getting one-shotted by a reinforcement that just showed up with a Killer Edge will love this.  Personally, I wouldn't use it on Normal Mode, but I'd love to use it to grind through a harder difficulty (if available on them).  

- TONS of characters.  It seems a lot of returning characters are playable via StreetPass and DLC.  That is amazing.  

- Return to Sacred Stones branching promotions.  My favorite part.  I love the replay value of SS due to this.  Can't wait to play through a trillion times!

- Changing class.  Not too familiar with this, but if it allows you to change the class of a character you like to make them something that suits your army (i.e. making a Social Knight an Armor Knight/etc.) that is awesome.

- Anyone know if the various characters look that much different from eachother or if it is all palette swaps?  I loved how everyone was a different color at least in SS, but it annoyed me how some were identical (i.e. your only two axe fighters, Ross and Garcia, looked identical)",,False,self,t5_2t0cn,False,,,True,t3_yo0oh,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/yo0oh/fire_emblem_awakening_discussion/,

The 1st and 2nd ones had one of the Morgans as bosses. Well when you get the Avatar next to them (Avatar has to be married) they will say something like ""Is that Master Grima? It can't be its been ages since master took that form. Must be that damn divine dragon Naga messing with my heart i can't fight them.. forgive me master"" and they teleport away from the map. In Future Past 3 when you defeat Grima/Avatar they say Morgan please forgive me i put you through so much. Which got me this idea that the Avatar before his body died blocked out the Morgans memories and sent them back in the past to live a life without all that darkness. 

The Harvest Scramble DLC conversation with Owain and Male Morgan got me thinking about my theory. Morgan says he remembered something from his past but passed out or something and cant remember what it was and Owain says ""your memories have clearly been sealed away with some kind of evil curse!"" and ""you didn't lose your memories. They were deliberately sealed away! And whatever fiend did it cursed you to fall unconscious if that seal was threatened!"" Then in the next conversation Owain starts yelling about its the Grimleal's doing fight it, But it just ends up Morgan remembered he forgot to eat breakfast. 


So that is my theory i wonder what you guys think about it and if you guys have any theories about Morgan post in the comments i would love to read them.

I have a few that I have discovered and can recommend. First is oddly enough Ricken!Inigo - most people recommend Chrom!Indigo due to his good mods and rightful king access, but I prefer pairing Chrom with FeMu to get a godly Lucina and rightful king Morgan (as Chrom!Indigo doesn't really put rightful king to good use apart from high proc lethality) Ricken!Inigo gets Luna - a wonderful skill, and life taker - giving him reliable healing. If you pair that up with gale force and aggressor, you have a force to reckon with. His mods aren't terrible - neutral strength and +3 to magic mean that he can still be an OK hero and a great sage or dread fighter. 

Another odd pairing that I find works is Gregor!Owain - while there's some class overlap, he gets decent mods across the board to everything but resistance (which is compensated by his being a dread fighter) and he gets arms thrift which goes brilliantly with all the braves that Owain excells with. Throw on aggressor and renewal and you have a force to be reckoned with. If only he could get Luna :S 

Finally Lon'qu!Laurent - gets great growths to magic, skill and speed. A vantage, vengeance, wrath, counter/life taker set is a terrifying thing to behold. If only he had arms thrift to keep him from burning through aversa'a knight :S

**The Basics**  
Hello my fellow tacticians! I'm here to ~~start arguments~~ because I wanted to play out a what-if character VS battle scenario with our favorite lords! Sixteen heroes have been gathered and randomly put into a double-elimination style bracket.

Each matchup, *YOU* get to vote on who would win in a no-holds-barred arena battle between the two!  

***
**The Rules**  

1. Vote on who you think would win. Characters are assumed to be equal level in their most-promoted **canon class**. They also have access to any weapon they can wield in that class.  

2. Regular FE battle rules do not apply. No turn order, think of this as an actual battle between characters!  

3. Give rationale for your choice! Explain why you think one character would best the other in the comments! This can be anything, from stats to weapons to looks to best catchphrase.  

4. You have roughly 24 hours from the time each round opens to vote before the next round begins.  

5. **PLEASE** don't cheat. One response per person, please. I have limited control over form-spamming, so please keep this honor system honorable!

Bear with me, for this goes into a lot of my thinking. I hope this facilitates good discussion.

**STREETPASS AI:**
From what I've seen, when your team is acquired by another player, they play like normal enemies. They start scattered, they never pair, and fight pretty much like sheep to slaughter..

This leads me to believe that each unit should be fairly self sufficient in order to be a threat to a human player. The only exception i can think of here are rally abilities and AOE buffs/debuffs/heals. (things like solidarity, dark mage skills, love bonds, renewel, staff heals, rally spectrum, etc)

This makes a convincing argument to the importance of rallys to boost allies, but I feel that certain skills are almost required for being annoying in street pass teams.

**OFTEN DISCUSSED (OP?) SKILLS:**
Limiting factors for skills. You only get 5. If you assume limit break mandatory (who wouldn't? it's a giant stat boost) you're left with 4 skills.

 In my opinion, *to be most annoying, you have to be hardest to kill*, slowly chipping away at their digital companions HP while preserving your own, and destroying their human spirit (sorry, I'm a little evil. maybe that's why i married Tharja...). So what makes you hard to kill?

 - **Defensive skills**
   - **aegis and pavise:** just dumb abilities with high proc rates after limit break. most importantly, *they can proc on lethality*
   - **miracle:** oh shit! i'm dead. jk. i'm find. I'll kill you next turn after renewal. T.T my only gripe with this skill is how annoying it is to acquire. Train a priest/cleric until 10? eh... i'll just use other skills.
   - **breakers:** really good if you can get core weaknesses alleviated, but i personally feel that aegis and pavise together are stronger. (2-4 breaker skills to cover your weaknesses vs. 2 skills to cover ALL types of damage). discussion on this?
   - **lucky 7:** i'm think if you have an extra slot, this is a poor mans all-breaker. The fights are usually under 7 turns anyways, so i see no reason why I replace 5 skills with 1 skill doing a shittier job.

 - **Healing abilities:**
   - **renewal:** live past the human onslaught? good. come back and fight again next turn with free health.
   - **lifetaker:** not recommended unless you have someone who can kill any given enemy human in one turn (unlikely since humans pair up for super awesome advantages).
   - **any sorc with nosferatu:** do dmg AND heal without guaranteed? sure. ok.
   - **armsthrift:** this really has it's own place, but I put it in healing because armsthrift + goddess staff ='s permanently healed team... it's a great skill in grinding and i see it's value in streetpass, but I feel it's a case basis.
   - **sol:** high proc rate. who doesn't love this skill? My only gripe is that it affects the proc-ing of...
 - **Offensive skills**
   - **vengeance:** great on sorcs or anyone who you didn't get sol for. lol
   - **luna:** i think after limit break, this skill only got stronger. they have 10 more armor, you cut 5, they still got 5 armor above base. but you got 10 more attack..
   - **wrath:** great with vantage/astra
   - **astra:** personally, I don't see the huge value in astra, i konw it's great for enemies you can do at least 1 dmg with, but why hit for miniscule amounts 5 times when you can hit once for a significant amount? especially when only one is allowed to proc?
   - **vantage:** I think this is an amazing skill to pair with luna and wrath/vengeance. for street pass on people without aegis/pavise i feel it's pretty damn useful/critical
   - **lethality:** pro: insta-kill if you're lucky enough to proc it. more a chance play than anything. cons: can be blocked by guard, pavise/aegis/miracle. too many things that will fuck you up.
   - **counter:** honestly had no idea where to put counter. it's nice, but i feel other skills outclass it. works well with miracle though, if you're feeling brave/lucky.

**PERSONAL CONCLUSION:**
Key points:

 - only one defensive and offensive skill can be proced each attack animation.
 - crits can happen on anything.
 - to my knowledge, if you have sol and the luna weapon, the two can not be combined (anyone have confirmation on this?)

I believe that aegis and pavise together with some sort of heal (sol/renewal) is really strong/annoying. the first three have high proc rates which will make you hard to kill if you can hurt them at all.

If the class you give sol to has low str/mag, then i suggest giving them renewal instead and luna so they hurt more. I also think pairing with vantage/wrath will make for potential KOs on the *enemies* turn.

I have toyed with the idea of lethality, but the more i look at it, the more i feel it's not worth it over consistent sustain and consistent dmg.

I also think that for the children of MU, making them sorcs with vengeance, aegis, pavise, and healing dark magic make for unkillable killing machines.

Galeforce is great in grinding and story play, but honestly I don't see the value of it in streetpass when you have to make sure YOU don't get 1 turn KO-ed by the enemy. It's much harder to kill a paired human player than a computer solo unit.

I don't know, these are just my ramblings, let me know what you think. I'd love to have some thoughtful discussion on this.

**TL;DR: the harder your units are to kill by themselves, the better the streetpass team. discuss.**

**GRINDING TIP:** for those of you grinding like me, I strongly suggest you get the paragon ability on everyone you plan on using (parents included) the level is pretty easy to auto-fight once you get a couple strong units. just sit them on the fort to the bottom right and turn off all animations. proceed to hit end turn over and over again. collect paragons, profit.

if you don't have strong units for that, then just grind EXPonential growth for a while, nbd. watch tv and do it.

I've noticed that the minimum exp gain for killing a unit is 8, which means you have to kill 13 enemies (after you reach the exp cap) to gain one level. paragon cuts that down to 7 enemies and you get some change exp on top. It's worth the investment by far in the long run.

I could use some help with this though, seeing as I'm not quite sure about how optimal my strategies are. Maybe some fellow redditors can help me improve upon my methods?

Let's start with the Prologue, since the Premonition is trivial. Here's what I have written so far:

Currently I'm farming the second last map (arguably the best map to farm in terms of sheer EXP and/or Bullion grinding), and have made about 60k (only did 20-30 Boxes so far, been distracted all day with work).

Personally I run 2 Grandmasters with Pair Ups ;on my Avatar's I use a pair I want to get Support levels on atm (subject to change once I max all my current available support levels; I'm a completionist whore and am aiming to have A rank supports on everyone), and on her son's I use his waifu, who gives +7 Luck, extremely useful in conjunction with Mug/Despoil. My Avatar is female so it can't run Mug (Barbs are male-only), so instead I get Leif's Sword (gives you Mug as long as you're using that weapon) + Armsthrift, which gives you (Luck x 2)% chance to not use up durability on weapons when you normally would. Her Luck is only 47 though, so I'm forced to use the occasional Hammerne to make up for the lost durability (though one 20/20 Leif's Sword lasts me at least 40-50 runs). Note that Mug and Leif's Sword *only apply when you're attacking on your turn*. Which is unfortunate because 75% of my enemies kill themselves on my units by attacking them during their turn. 

This combination nets me a whopping average of 7 Bullion(S)s per Reeking Boxes (the map I grind on guarantees 4 Bullion(S)s), which amounts to a net profit of 2.2k per run (each run costing 4.8k). Pretty minuscule, even by my standards... Wouldn't mind having unlimited moves on my turn but even with Galeforce I can't really push up the margin much higher. 

Skills and important stats are:

Avatar: Galeforce, Armsthrift, Ignis, Acrobat, Renewal

Luck is only 47, which is unfortunate, since Leif's Sword is based on Luck. If I was a Dancer I'd equip +4 Luck instead of Acrobat tbh, but they put the Luck bonus skill on a dumb class that I can't reclass into :(

Morgan: Armsthrift, Ignis, Acrobat, Renewal, Mug/Despoil

With his waifu paired up with him he gets 58 total Luck, which is great. Unfortunately he can't learn Galeforce because he's a male and it didn't get passed down (idk the exact methods to do any of that stuff, unfortunately), but nonetheless he gets Bullions regularly. 

This combination is also good for profiting simply because you never have to replace your weapons (unless you're me and get really unlucky with the goddamn 6% chance to lose 1 durability on Leif's Sword -_-), which saves a ton of money considering you could easily run through 2 Silver weapons in one map run if you're soloing.

I hope you don't mind walls of text.

 **Note that this theory goes fairly in depth into lore that never made its way over to the states. If you are familiar with FE7 and not FE4, you might want to look at http://fireemblem.wikia.com/wiki/Miracle_of_Darna and http://fireemblem.wikia.com/wiki/Forseti_%28character%29 for starters.**

 

Before we get to the main point, let's lay down some important background information.

 

A fundamental basis of this theory is another theory, albeit a previously existing and fairly well-regarded one. The assumption that we will be making is that Elibe and Archanea are joined by the Dragon's Gate - and furthermore, that the Golden Age of the Dragon Tribe only began after the Elibean dragons arrived in Archanea. Thus, the Divine Dragon / Earth Dragon war does not start until at least around two thousand years after the events of FE7, as FE7 itself is around 1000 years after the Scouring.

 

For our purposes, the exact mechanics of the transfer through the Dragon's Gate are irrelevant. Similarly, the possibility that some dragons are native to Archanea and existed before the Elibean dragons arrived (which I personally doubt), is unimportant, as there is no indication from primary sources Nils and Ninian that the Golden Age of the Dragon Tribe was in progress before the arrival of the Elibean dragon tribes.

 

With the advent of Awakening, there is now a satisfactory ""other side"" to the Dragon's Gate in Archanea - the Ruins of Time. It fulfills all feasible requirements (sufficiently old, association with dragons due to Naga's Tear, mysterious warping powers, proximity to the ancient dragon city of Thabes), and there is no better candidate that has appeared. There is still the possibility, however, that the dragons of Elibe existed at the same time as the dragons of Archanea, and the Ending Winter was the catalyst for the Divine Dragon / Earth Dragon war in Archanea, with the Dragon's Gate leading... somewhere else.

 

While I cannot eliminate this as a possibility, I find it unlikely for several reasons. Firstly, Nils describes a land with few scattered humans, initially apprehensive or hostile towards the dragons, but with no long-term conflict occurring. This fits with what we know of Archanea at the time - it was not until 500 years after the Divine Dragon / Earth Dragon war that the first solid human political entity appeared on the continent. Furthermore, the Greco-Roman style of the temple shown in the CG is consistent with other structures in Archanea - though this is less indicative of anything, as temples generally tend towards such an architectural style in fantasy works. Furthermore, I am of the opinion that the Elibe -&gt; Archanea theory makes for a more compelling narrative in general, so in the absence of any significant body of proof for the alternate hypothesis, I believe it is a perfectly reasonable conclusion.

 

With that out of the way, let us move to the main body of the theory. There is a very simple connection that can be made between FE7 and FE4 that establishes FE7 as an indispensable part of the central plot arc of the Fire Emblem games (FE4/5 -&gt; FE1 -&gt; FE3 -&gt; FE13), and justifies the actions of a certain exceedingly important character in the Jugdral games.

 

 

To put it simply, Nils is Forseti.

 

 

To substantiate this claim, let's look closely at what we know about Nils and Forseti

 

Nils is a ""young"" (1000 or so) year old half-ice dragon. Whether or not he knows of his human heritage is questionable, but for all intents and purposes he seems indistinguishable from a full-blooded Ice Dragon. By the chronology we are using, he would probably be around 3000 or so by the Divine Dragon / Earth Dragon war - around about as old as Tiki in Awakening. He seems to have a fondness for music and is decently skilled with a flute, given that he disguises himself as a bard when on the run from the Black Fang. He is initially distrustful of humans, but throughout the events of FE7 he comes to gain a much greater respect for them, changing his opinion on the species that drove him and his kin from Elibe.

 

Of the 12 dragons who descended upon the crusaders at Darna, Forseti was the youngest. From his association with wind magic, we can assume that he is an Ice Dragon, as throughout the Fire Emblem series ice and wind magics are very closely associated with one another. Of all the dragons, he was the most passionate about helping humanity, and thus was largely responsible for the Miracle occurring. In the second half of Genealogy, he possesses Lewyn - a man known for previously disguising himself as a simple, flute-playing scarf-wearing Bard. Throughout the second part of the game, Forseti (in Lewyn's body) shows consistent and notable concern for children - not only is his first priority rescuing the child prisoners taken by the worshippers of Loptyr in their Child Hunts, but out of the three possible daughters of Lewyn that he can talk to, he only shows real empathy when Tinny recounts the tale of being tortured by Hilde as a girl.

 

Nils being Forseti explains many of the notable and curious aspects of the dragon's character. It explains why, alone amongst the dragons, he felt so passionate about aiding humanity, (to the extent that he would inhabit a human's body for almost two decades) because he alone has had his faith in humanity restored through the events of FE7. It explains why he is so passionate about saving the children from the dark mages of the Lopt Sect, because he has first-hand knowledge of the fear and hopelessness of their situation. The fact that he is the son of one of the most powerful sorcerers on Elibe might explain why his Holy Blood gives magical bonuses, or how a relatively young dragon was one of the 12 most powerful alive (And though Nils never gets a chance to use his abilities, remember that Ninian oneshots two Fire Dragons with magic immediately after being resurrected, which might be indicative of power that runs in the family).

 

Additionally, if you accept the Elibe -&gt; Archanea theory, there is no legitimate argument against this theory. Sure they have different names, but ""Nils"" is hardly a name that a dragon would go by. It's also perfectly reasonable to assume that the dragon siblings were either given a ""dragon"" name and a ""human"" name at birth, or took pseudonyms when they were on the run in Elibe. Additionally, Fa is precedent for dragons going by different names when around humans that they do when around other dragons.

 

In the end, this theory ultimately matters little in the larger scope of the series - it doesn't redefine how we view any events or challenge our perceptions of the world. However, it offers an interesting connection between FE7 and FE4, and offers an interesting take on who is ultimately one of the most important characters in the series.

1372306128.0,9,self.fireemblem,1h5p2n,Just Some Thoughts on Awakening Prequel (Watch For Falling Spoilers),TransPM,13,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1h5p2n/just_some_thoughts_on_awakening_prequel_watch_for/,"I was thinking recently about a lot of the history of Awakening's world, and how a great deal of it is either untouched, or underdeveloped. *If* the world of Awakening were to be revisited, for one, I think it would *have* to be in prequel form [endgame](#s ""Grima's kinda dead"") , but I also think that there could be some great potential for a prequel. Here are some topics/character's they could work with:

 - The Ylisse/Plegia war lead by Chrom and Lissa's father. As far as I've seen, all the information on this war we receive is that Chrom's father did some horrible things, left Plegia destitute, and died. I think there's a lot of room for further development there.

 - The Taguel. Panne just kinda shows up and introduces herself as ""the last Taguel"", saying that her entire race was wiped out... and then the whole issue kinda gets swept under the rug. A prequel could explore either a time when Taguel were still around, *or* even the events surrounding their extermination.

 - What Validar was doing prior to Awakening. I'm not just talking about Validar in respect to being MU's father, I think it would also be interesting to see what he was doing at the time that he [Aversa Support](#s ""destroyed Aversa's village and 'adopted' her because of her shadowgift ability."")

 - We could see what Flavia and Basilio were like either before they were Khans, or as they were just starting out as Khans (it's unclear how old they are or how long they've been Khans). The game could even take place during the time when the Khans themselves fought in the tournament for rule over Ferox.

 - Walhart looks like a pretty old dude, I don't know if it would make much sense narrative-wise, but I do kinda wonder what he was like before he was ""The Conquerer"".

 - Gregor: The more I learn about this guy, the more I realize that he's basically the most interesting man in the world. And he's pretty old, so there's potential to further explore his exploits in a prequel. For starters: [Cherche support](#s ""He once saved a young Minerva's life ."") [Lon'Qu support](#s ""Gregor was once one of the champions who fought in the Feroxi Khan's tournament"") [Tharja support](#s ""Gregor's not even 'Gregor's' real name. Gregor is actually 'Gregor's' brother who died."")

 - Also, Nowi is reportedly 1000s of years old, so she would have at the very least been alive at that time, perhaps even involved (I don't know what a Taguel's life expectancy is, but Maybe Panne was around too.)

It went well and good for the most part, but as I continued reading about the game, I realized I'd missed many opportunities to strengthen my team through passing down skills. I also realized I missed the Boots in Chapter 17. I was still having trouble with my team doing battles like the one for Limit Breaker, so I figured, what the hell - let's try this again.

The goal is to essentially follow the ideal parent strategy (with one or two changes, I guess) and for a Lucina!Morgan. In my last playthrough, Sniper Gaius!Noire was the dominant force, and because I love Sniper Noire, I plan to spec her the same. 

But what are important skills to pass down that you can't get on the children? Galeforce Inigo is a clear choice, for example; who should I try to get Counter on? Aegis/Pavise? Anyone that might not otherwise be able to get Luna?

And, are there other important missables like the Boots? I know Owain has his own special sword in his Paralogue, and there's something in Laurent's paralogue too I think?

Also, any information on good setups for the children that have helped you tackle the harder DLC would be great. The only ones I really have set in stone right now are Sniper Noire, Sage Laurent, and Tank Manakete Nah. Previously, I had been using Kjelle as a tank as well (General/Paladin with all the defensive Skills).

I know these are a lot of extensive questions. Any tidbits you all can share from your experience would be greatly appreciated.

For any other long-time fans of the series who have played Awakening, how does it hold up compared to them?

I played a bit of the demo, but it lacked a certain feel that I liked about the GBA games. Perhaps it's the sense of functionality? I mean that in a pseudo-sense because I felt that everything in the GBA games was designed to be practical. The armors and weapons all seemed practical and not over-the-top. Awakening seems to change it up slightly and exaggerate things quite a bit, including the sexuality of certain characters' designs. But that's just me ranting. 

TL;DR, how does Awakening compare to the GBA games?

Something about her quiet and nice nature as a girl who tends to like the ordinary stuff someone like her would do yet she has a gigantic wyvern named Minerva and is pretty much a force of nature in battle.

SO I was just on my 8th or 9th try on chapter 9 (hard/classic). First Vaike kept dying, so I removed him. Then I made some stupid mistakes, but at this point I have a pretty good strategy up to when the wyvern riders come in from behind. When that happens, I retreat all of my units to deal with them so that they can fully focus on the approaching army next turn. 

When the big group of units got there, everything went perfectly. Units were dodging when they needed to, Lissa protected my MU from a fatal attack, everyone had good positions, and Chrom was wrecking shit out in front where I had positioned him so he could talk to Tharja next turn. With only one mage and Tharja left, Tharja went up and attacked Kellem from range. At this point I'm ecstatic, because they don't do enough damage to kill each other and Tharja is blocking the other mage from finishing Kellem off. 

Then it happened. Kellem, the god damn knight, gets his first crit this playthrough with a javelin and kills her, ruining this near-perfect run. I was considering not restarting and just hating Kellem for a while, but then the other mage came up and finished him off. The one time you fucking overachieve, Kellem.

The other, less dramatic time was with Lon'qu. I was on mission 4, and Lon'Qu was in a somewhat dangerous position, but I wasn't too worried. Why? Let's review what Myrmidon's are good at. Crit'ing and dodging. That's their niche. So what did Lon'Qu have to do to survive? Crit one of two chances at 40%, and dodge a 39% hit chance from the enemy. He did neither. I did not go back for him.

**Today's Matchups**

Ike Vs. Hector!!!  

Lucina Vs. Ephraim!!!  

***
**The Basics**  
Hello my fellow tacticians! I'm here to ~~start arguments~~ because I wanted to play out a what-if character VS battle scenario with our favorite lords! Sixteen heroes have been gathered and randomly put into a double-elimination style bracket.

Each matchup, *YOU* get to vote on who would win in a no-holds-barred arena battle between the two!  

***
**The Rules**  

1. Vote on who you think would win. Characters are assumed to be equal level in their most-promoted **canon class**. They also have access to any weapon they can wield in that class.  

2. Regular FE battle rules do not apply. No turn order, think of this as an actual battle between characters!  

3. Give rationale for your choice! Explain why you think one character would best the other in the comments! This can be anything, from stats to weapons to looks to best catchphrase.  

4. You have roughly 24 hours from the time each round opens to vote before the next round begins.  

5. **PLEASE** don't cheat. One response per person, please. I have limited control over form-spamming, so please keep this honor system honorable!

1370190986.0,11,self.fireemblem,1fiwvo,Luna/Crit build - an alternative to Lethality,asakyun,12,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1fiwvo/lunacrit_build_an_alternative_to_lethality/,"So I was theorycrafting for streetpass, when I thought about this.

What you'll need

- Swordmaster or Sorcerer

- Sol Katti or Ruin (More Sol Kattis from DLC)

- Limit Breaker (obviously)

- Character that can get Luna, Wrath and Vantage.

- Access to Barbarian, Great Knight (Cav/Knight) and Myrmidon to get the above skills.

- Aggressor, Counter, Gamble or Res+10 are nice options for the last slot.


Pros:

- Compared to the maximum 3 characters that can use Lethality-RK, you can potentially fill 10 slots (but optimally 6) with Luna-crit characters, even if you use avatars only.

- At its highest potential (using Gamble), there is a 28% chance of getting a Luna-crit, 31% chance if using a +Skl avatar, compared to 24% chance of Lethality-RK.

Cons:

- No access to Brave weapons or consecutive hit weapons

- Class access is extremely restricted


Note that the full potential of this build only comes out when a character on your streetpass team is at half HP, another one of its weaknesses in comparison to Lethality-RK.

This theory works on this basis - 1.5x the enemy's def/res is added to your own damage when you activate Luna on a critical. Thus, damage dealt by the Luna-crit depends heavily on the enemy's def/res.

Proccing a Luna-crit on a maxed LB General using the Sol Katti will add (1.5 times 60 = 90) damage to your attack, while the same Luna-crit using Ruin will add 60 damage to your attack.

Luna-crit build is also a lot more attainable than the Lethality-RK build and has about the same activation rate (appx. 25%). You assume that you have 54% chance to get Luna, 97% chance for crit (-55% for limit break luck cap) which leaves you at a 22.68% chance to get the Luna-crit. On the other hand, Sorceror's Luna-crit has much less activation chance, at 18.72%. (Alternatively Aversa!Morgan w/ shadowgift + Sage can make up for the crappiness of Ruin Luna-crits, but this would be wasted.)

Gamble brings out the full potential, with a 28.08% chance of getting the luna-crit (52% chance crit and 54% chance Luna) as well as increasing efficacy before the character drops below 50%.

The activation rate is much higher when they have not capped luck. By comparison, there's a 24% chance to OHKO using Lethality-RK on a Hero, one of the most rounded out classes with the second highest SKL cap in the game.

The one big difference is that Luna-crit does not allow you to use Brave weapons, a huge factor in Lethality-RK builds (up to 4 chances at lethality in 1 turn) and that Lethality-RK does not depend on the enemy's Luck stat. (Luck will reduce the likelihood of criticals)


And so, the ultimate Streetpass troll team would be 3x Lethality-RK characters (Lucina-Inigo-Morgan) and 7x Luna-crit characters, for example, 6 Avatars. There's better ways to get Luna-crit but I'm lazy. Preferably 3 Lethality-RK assassins and 6 Luna-crit Swordmasters. FeMU cannot access Luna-crit, but MaMU cannot get Inigo!Morgan, and Lethality-RK is generally stronger than Luna-Crit because of access to Brave weapons and their equivalents.

1. Because MU is the best parent for each child, they are ineligible. Instead, in a separate comment, you can post your ""MU Build"" for that child character.

1. Give your rationale for why that character is makes the best parent. Could be skills, stat mods, class sets, synergy or something else! Post your favorite build as well!

There would be two campaigns to the game, one where you play the ""Advance Wars"" style, one ""Fire Emblem Style"". In each mode, you play FE levels AND AW levels.

**Advance Wars mode**: For AW-style levels, your FE favorites become COs, with their class having a generally determinant effect on their passive bonuses. Kellam, for example, would grant his units a defense boost (like Reverse-Max), with a CO power that allows units to become invisible on non-road or city tiles, as if under fog of war. Lonqu would have luck-based passives similar to Nell to replicate crits, and a CO power that allows his units to have a possibility of attacking a second time. The list goes on. 

For this mode's version of FE levels, Lords instead become COs that boost your other units, with opposing bosses also becoming COs. Ephraim boosts unit's strength and def, with a CO power that increases movement and criticals slightly. Meg is the Flak of this game and no one uses her, Valter's passives boost his units speed and grants them all a low % of using Pierce, with a CO power that grants them all Pierce for the round and boosts movement, etc. 

**Fire Emblem mode**: For FE levels, your COs become units like any other. Eagle becomes a Dracoknight/Wyvern Lord, Drake becomes a pirate, Max a fighter/warrior, Grit a sniper, Kanbei a hero, Andy a monk, etc. They have varying growths, though tend to be similar to Lords (i.e. good growths, ~~fuck Eliwood~~). Also, all maps can be won either by seizing the castle or eliminating all enemy units. No escapes or other variety. 

For this mode's version AW-levels, COs and Lords become units with boosts. Eagle is a boosted fighter jet, Hector is a boosted Neo/Mega-tank, Darros is a Cruiser, Ross a Battleship, Grit a boosted Rocket, etc. (boosts vary based on CO's normal focus or the character's growth rates from FE).

A couple months back, I asked what you'd like to see in a potential fangame ([here](http://redd.it/14l7ta)'s the thread). At this point, I've got a lot of the mechanics, the outlines of a plot and about a dozen characters laid out. I'm planning to start the actual coding over the next week (Spring Break WHOOHOO!), and seeing how big an impact Awakening has made on this place, I'd like to see if opinions have changed.

Reminder - it's an FE8 prequel, set 800 years before events. Current plans include third tiers, trainees, 32 unique classes (not counting units taken from other games or Lord classes, though I did borrow a few ideas from [Bwdyeti's project](http://bwdyeti.com/fe7x/)) with a refined and branching class tree, the FE8 map system minus infinite experience (except in easy mode), a Radiant Dawn style skill system, a Capture system, Lv.21 promotions, a strength-magic split, one entirely new weapon class, an expanded repertoire of monsters (40 total, including bosses) and hopefully a creature campaign after the (ideally) ~40 chapter-long storyline. Oh, and it'll be hard.

Completion of the project is going to take a great deal of time. I probably won't ask for help until most of it's done and spriting becomes a priority (because 74 new unit animations, 29 skill animations and 35 spell animations is gonna take a while. Shit, that list is a lot longer than I'd realized). Rest assured I'll spend a great deal of time on developing a believable and engaging storyline and get many outside opinions on it as I do.

So there are two things I need from you guys. First, any ideas you'd like to see implemented? I've heard a lot of good things about Awakening's support/marriage system, but I haven't had the opportunity to play it myself. Is it something I should consider trying?

trying to create the most powerful unit possible :3

Vaike marries Cherche and creates super strong Gerome
(I'd go with MU cause he has one extra point in strength but that defeats the purpose)

Female MU with Str+/Mag- as her asset/flaw, marries Gerome and creates bulky as fuck General Morgan with max stats at:
HP - 80
Str - 61
Mag - 26
Skl - 44
Spd - 35
Lck - 45
Def - 55
Res - 31

Go through Dread Fighter first to give him Resistance +10, and Aggressor. (Attack +10 during user's turn)
Pass down Galeforce from Female MU if you want, although I would prefer something like Renewal. (Probably won't even be needing it)
Then go ahead and give him the Limit Break skill, along with Pavise and Aegis.

Now you're looking at:
HP - 80
Str - 71
Mag - 36
Skl - 54
Spd - 45
Lck - 55
Def - 65
Res - 41

So you`re going to be hitting twice often, with Pavise/Aegis activating over 50% of the time.
Give him a forged Brave Axe with Mt 17. Put the rest in Hit rate cause 60 just isn't worthwhile at all.
Now, assuming you can hit twice, in addition to the Brave weapon effect, and also assuming the enemy has 0 defense,
with Aggressor in effect, you're looking at 98 damage each hit, for a total of 392 damage. Totally excessive but pretty fucking awesome.

Chances are, physical enemy attacks won't be doing anything, and if they do, there's always Pavise and Aegis
You could replace Pavise or even Aegis cause it's pretty unnecessary now that I think about it. Stick in Axefaire for added effect and use Tomebreaker for the magic weakness.

ALSO
Marry him off to get a maximum of +9 in strength and defense. (Assuming you marry a female Wyvern Lord)
So with Axefaire, Tomebreaker, Limit Break, Aggressor, and Resistance +10, with a forged 17Mt Brave Axe,
the maximum damage you could deal in one battle is 448. :333333
Not accounting for Rallying, crits, or the enemy's defense that is.

definitely doing this goodbye streetpass enemies.

Sorry for the wall of text,

TL;DR: Create super Morgan that can do 448 damage. 

Please correct me if I made any mistakes or if there's anything that can top that.

Today's discussion is about Manaketes. Manaketes wield Dragonstones, which grant stat bonuses depending on which one is used.  Manaketes are ranged, which give them a great advantage over Taguels. However, their skills are somewhat more niche than those of the Taguel's. 

Manaketes learn two skills: Odd Rhythm and Wyrmsbane.

Odd rhythm increases Accuracy and Avoid +10 during odd numbered turns. It is learned by Manaketes at Level 1. While it's somewhat of a generic skill, it's still very solid since it activates every other turn.

Wyrmsbane allows manaketes to deal super effective damage to other dragon types, such as other manaketes or wyvern riders. This skill is somewhat more specific towards only dragons, and somewhat less useful than beastbane since you never fight manaketes in story mode and wyvern riders don't appear in every level.

**Today's Matchups**

Lucina Vs. Marth!

Ephraim Vs. Chrom!

***
**The Basics**  
Hello my fellow tacticians! I'm here to ~~start arguments~~ because I wanted to play out a what-if character VS battle scenario with our favorite lords! Sixteen heroes have been gathered and randomly put into a double-elimination style bracket.

Each matchup, *YOU* get to vote on who would win in a no-holds-barred arena battle between the two!  

***
**The Rules**  

1. Vote on who you think would win. Characters are assumed to be equal level in their most-promoted **canon class**. They also have access to any weapon they can wield in that class.  

2. Regular FE battle rules do not apply. No turn order, think of this as an actual battle between characters!  

3. Give rationale for your choice! Explain why you think one character would best the other in the comments! This can be anything, from stats to weapons to looks to best catchphrase.  

4. You have roughly 24 hours from the time each round opens to vote before the next round begins.  

5. **PLEASE** don't cheat. One response per person, please. I have limited control over form-spamming, so please keep this honor system honorable!

And sometimes Anna, depending on if there are treasures on the map at all. Since I'm not sure how much I really want to stick with the last couple of characters, I usually have the top 8 take care of almost everything. I can put Morgan and Severa in any danger and not have to worry. They are that good.

Since I was failing to beat chapter 3 after a good three weeks, I decided that the save was a lost cause. I wanted something new, but not impossible. Therefore, I tried creating a challenge for Awakening. It goes as such:

-Set game to Hard Classic

-Must make a FeMU (optimally named Pandora) , any asset/flaw are fair game

-FeMU MUST marry Chrom

-All characters other than MU, Chrom, Lucina, and Morgan MUST be killed in the chapter they appear (Lon'qu must be killed in the next immediate chapter since he joins after).

-Other characters may be used in the chapter they appear, however they have to die before they end. Also, the heroes of each chapter must either be MU, Chrom, Lucina, or Morgan. If the hero is someone else, the chapter must be redone.

This is basically the gist of the challenge. However, for extra challenge, these rules may be enforced:

-MU and Morgan may only be classed as tactician/grandmaster and Chrom/Lucina must only be lord/great lord. They can, however, use second seals at level 20 to start these classes again.

-NO DLC GRINDING ;-)

2. Inigo was my gold medalist. He was in 4,750 battles and had about 2400 victories. I had 5 people with over 1,000 confirmed kills, and I had 27,000 renown.

The laguz of previous games such as Path of Radiance work differently than the Taguel or the Manaketes of FE13. Instead of transforming before they attack, they turn into their beast forms when their transformation gauge is full. The Transformation gauge ranges from 0 to 20, and all laguz have a pre determined starting number.

Every turn the laguz spends untransformed they gain +4 to the gauge, and every time they're attacked while untransformed they gain +2.

When they transform, they gain powerful combat bonuses and increased movement. Every time they attack a unit, they lose 1 to the gauge and every turn they automatically lose 3. When the gauge hits zero, the laguz reverts to its human form.

I love the Fire Emblem games, and love Game of Thrones! I'm sure there are many people out here just like me, so why not combine the two?

First of all, there are some major spoilers in this thread for the show/books, so readers/watchers beware!

So, there are people who can create custom sprites for GBA ROMS, and possibly maps, so why not do a Game of Thrones themed mod?

There could be many different families that you could 5 or 6 chapters with, and have characters of that family fight with you.(Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, etc.) and each family could have different characters.

For example: The Stark Lineup (I'm not sure about character upgrades, I'm open to suggestions in this area)

Ned: Lord class, he would start with Ice as a weapon.

Robb: He would start at the mercenary class, but would be skinned over to look more lordly. He would likely upgrade into Hero, or maybe Paladin or GreatKnight? (I don't think class restrictions should really apply to make it more like the story)

Theon (technically not Stark but..): Archer, and would upgrade into a Ranger.

Bran: He could be like a Manakete, but instead turn into a Wolf (his Warg abilities) Hodor would be carrying him in his sprite.

Sansa/Catelyn: I wasn't sure about what to do with these two, perhaps they could be Clerics, or something. I was thinking Dancers but I think that whores would better apply to that (Ros from the show, Chataya from the books)

Rodrik Cassel: Cavalier, upgrade into Paladin.

Arya: Thief, upgrade into Assassin. (For when she is in Braavos) could start with Needle, a rapier like weapon.

Jon: Mercenary, and would upgrade into Ranger. Would eventually earn Longclaw.

I could likely make characters for each Family, and there could be individual units that could be recruited aswell (Brienne, Victarion, Bronn, Whores, etc.)

I have many more ideas for characters that could be in the mod (Jaime as Hero, Loras as a Cavalier)

I'm open to suggestions and would love to hear what you guys think of this idea! ",,False,self,t5_2t0cn,False,,,True,t3_1jg4ww,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1jg4ww/fire_emblemgame_of_thrones_long_post_a_song_of/,

Sorry guys, been caught up in my studies. Today I chose to shift the focus of these threads a bit and start talking about the child characters, the first of which will be Lucina.

Lucina is probably one of the best child characters in the game. With access to a great selection of skills and a default parent with solid modifiers, she's a worthwhile addition to any team.

Lucina gets +1 str, +1 skl, +1 spd, +1 luk, and -1 def and res from Chrom. A bunch of the important stuff with room to grow with your other parent's modifiers, so not too shabby on the max stats. You don't lose any of the important stuff either. 

She also has access to a GREAT selection of skills, being the only other unit in the game with access to both Rightful king (as a girl?) and Aether, covering her needs for both healing and offensive modifiers. In addition, she has access to the default class of cavalier, meaning she gets Aegis, which synergizes greatly with rightful king. It's even better if you give her a parent who has access to the general class, so she can get pavise, since her only other class options are from the rest of the cavalier class and the archer class. 

She has a fairly decent selection of parents: Sumia, Maribelle, Sully, Olivia, FMU, and some random village chick. Personally, I like Olivia, since you get 1 spd and 1 skill without losing out on some strength like you would if you used sully or sumia as Lucina's mother. You also get access to some great skills from the pegasus rider and myrmidon classes. The only issue is that you still have a limited class selection, but they are very strong classes. (but no access to Pavise!) Also, Rightful king Inigo, which is pretty good. 

She makes a great mother, since she has great skills she can pass on and great modifiers. Lucina can also wield the Parallel Falchion, which is an added bonus. If only her sibling could, too.

Overall, she's basically a better Chrom, with superior stat caps and skill/class selections. Personally, one of my favorite units. USE HER. She's awesome.

**Class Discussion Thread: Warrior**

The Warrior Class is a promotion of the Fighter and Barbarian Classes. They are able to wield Axes and Bows. Stat wise, they're very slow and have a moderate amount of Skill and Defense, but high HP. In order to compensate for their lack of Speed, they have the second highest Strength cap (without modifiers) in FE13, only falling behind Generals and Berserkers. (Warriors have 48, while the two have 50) However, they aren't as tanky as generals or do much damage as Berserkers, making them a middle ground class used because they can tank while still dealing a respectable amount of damage.

Warriors learn two skills: Rally Strength, and Counter.

Rally Strength is a skill that they learn at level five. It gives +4 to Strength to all allies within a 3 tile radius for one turn. It's not very useful unless you really need that bonus strength to kill a unit and you're out of range to attack, but an ally isn't. Generally, it's better to use your warrior's one turn to attack, since they have a pretty good strength rating. 

Their other skill is Counter, learned at level 15. Counter is one of the strongest skills added in FE13. Counter returns 100% of the damage taken by this unit to the unit attacking it, only if the attacker is adjacent to the warrior. This means that squishy units with less health can sometimes crit and end up killing themselves instead of the warrior. This means that despite their lack of speed, enemies must still be wary of attacking warriors. (And how many times have we accidentally killed our units in story mode when we didn't realize a warrior had counter?) In order to balance this skill out in story mode, when any units get last hit by counter, no experience is gained by the unit. You will only receive the normal exp for attacking a unit if you attack the unit before you kill them with counter.

Counter serves to make the warrior a very dangerous class to deal with, forcing you to use ranged units to weaken them enough to get a last hit with your other melee units. Skills like Sol, Aether, or Lifetaker also help a lot against counter.

How do you guys run your warriors? Why warriors over Heroes and Swordsmasters? What skills or changes would make this class stronger? What's weak/strong about this class?

Next week's discussion will be on the swordsmaster. Following that discussion will be a thread comparing the three classes. (warrior, swordsmaster, and hero) Don't hesistate to PM me if you have any suggestions or if you spot any mistakes!

I'll go over the hardest parts of the game, which tend to be the beginning of the game! I will also include information regarding the Second Seal, and how to use/abuse it properly.

Fire Emblem: Awakening's Lunatic mode begins with a burst and a bit of a bang. The Premonition level is really easy, endable on turn two. No need for information here. Here are some general tips on this mode. 

* You will have to learn to think really well outside of the box. Insane strategies will become a thing to try and master here.

*  To succeed in Lunatic Mode, you will more than likely need to use Frederick in the first few chapters. 

* Always pair up.

* Try and make sure that My Unit has speed spec. I'll go into that later.

* Learn to abuse and love the fact that you can view the ranges that enemies have. This is of the utmost importance.

* Most importantly, EVERY single move counts, especially in Chapter 2! 

* Be patient! If you get wrecked after a while for too long, take a break!

* Important: BE WARY of the difficulty gap from Hard to here. I see new players go and brag and say, hah, why are you using Freddy? He's not useful at all in Hard, etc, with different variations. Lunatic is a huge step up in difficulty from hard. Hard was a faceroll that I beat in two days where I solo'd half the levels with the lords and MU. Lunatic requires a lot more analytical thinking and care because ONE misstep can end the stage quickly!

So now, having opened up with that, let us begin with the guide to success from the Prologue to Chapter 4. 

Prologue

* The Prologue gives you access to Chrom, Lissa, Frederick, and My Unit (MU). Pair Lissa with Frederick (calling him Freddy now) and trade the vulnerary to him. Move him to kill the reachable Myrmi/Merc (crap I forgot) that's behind the partition thing. Pair Chrom and MU together. End turn, and then two ruffian dudes will attack Freddy and he will almost kill both of them, and a mercenary will run around and approach MU and Chrom. Have Freddy kill the mercenary dude approaching, and then have MU kill one of the ruffians. A lone mage dude is gonna start his approach down, and on the next phase, you're gonna need to kill him fast, as he will pretty much rape Freddy. After this point, heal your guys all up, and land on the event tiles. Good loot is essential, and you will realize that some of the mode in the beginning relies on good loot and stat rolls. After all of that, bring Freddy up and stay in range of the second group. He should be able to land a few hits, have MU grab some kills if possible. Boss strategy: have Fred sit next to him, let him get attacked once. Boss takes damage, finish with MU. After stage ends, my MU was on level 3, with almost 80% into level 4. 

Chapter 1

* The general strategy here is to have Freddy do most of the damage, and have a few potshots in for MU if possible. Have MU initially take the event tile and do not attack. Following enemy phase, run him and pair with Virion and start running everyone except Freddy upwards and then left, with Freddy dancing the spaces between the two fortresses. The hammer unit is a fat dick, and make sure Freddy has a Bronze Sword to counter him, and if possible, remain on a tree panel or a fort. Kill the hammer guy and the stage is really easy. Boss has a ranged attack, so continue moving the party train around the edges, and dance Freddy around the forts. Boss dies easily. The hammer is the huge problem. NEXT CHAPTER!

* NOTE: If you decide to pair MU with Freddy at some point, having speed as an asset will be miles useful as it allows Freddy to attack twice! Another thing that will be useful is if you are going to be a magic wielder. Magic wielder means Freddy gets a free Bronze sword, which will be lovely since a majority of the group are axe users! 

Chapter 2

* Okay, seriously, fuck this chapter. Fuck it hard. You will seriously need to abuse the enemy range feature. Click on all the units on the bottom half of the map. There should be a four panel tetronimo pattern that will be your safe spot. Pair Lissa with Stahl. Following that, move Chrom to the east side of the safe zone. Put Vaike in the bottom center of the safe zone. My unit is top center. Move Lissa/Stahl to the bottom left. Before you do though. She should be ahead of MU. Bring Freddy and position him one slot left of her, and two slots up. The plan here now is to keep Freddy healthy and dance the bottom group over towards him, while running the other guys right and upwards. After two or three turns, most of the map should be wiped out. Freddy will deviate towards the Northwest of the bottom half of the map, and the others will move right and up. Once bottom half is down, rest is easy. Watch Fred's life, and make sure to bring him just within range, and sparingly use Elixirs. TRY not to though. They are vital, and the game changers. The less vulneraries the better. You will also need to keep as many silver lance usages left as possible for the fourth chapter. This is the hardest chapter, once you clear it it is easy sailing. 

Chapter 3

* This one isn't bad. Give Fred the iron axe that Vaike has. Pair them together, move the group towards the west, and recruit Kellam on turn two. From here, you move upwards, and towards the boss. Trade the Javelin from Kellam to Freddy at first chance. Will be useful. Trust me. Rinse, repeat phases, staying aware of the enemies and their ranges. Pretty easy and straightforward.

Chapter 4

* Easy chapter. I basically ended up solo running with MU and Freddy. The Silver Lance proves vital because it ends up popping the mages in one hit LOL. Keep aware of the ranges, and kite around, try to let MU land some potshots, though it's not important as after this chapter raising him becomes laughable. 

Post-Chapter 4:

* You get the Outrealm Gate. Purchase the stage the Golden Gaffe, and repeat that stage a lot for EASY money, and EASY levels. Kinda breaks Lunatic after and becomes laughably easy. :) I have all my units at almost level 20 LOL and I'm about to start Chapter 5. If you're bored, play Xenologues 1: Champions of Yore. Bottom line: you pay $2.50 and you get infinite farming potential. I am surprised they didn't limit it!

Now, a bit of information on seals.


* After excessive farming on the DLC levels and chapters, you'll get a Master Seal. The Master Seal can evolve anyone level 10+, including the lords and tactician. Get one of them to 20 ASAP and seriously evolve them at first chance. It's gamebreaking later on. 

* The other seal to keep in mind is Second Seal, which is a bullshit broken item. In previous iterations, getting to 20 on the promoted class is the end of the level train. NO MORE HERE! When they hit 20 you can use a second seal, to RELEVEL THEM all over again, with no stat losses for the same class, and slight rebalancing for a different class. This can be used on unpromoted units at level 10+ and on promoted units at 10+. Easy, right? This system is infinite until you hit your wanted stat caps. Farm DLC for easy levels, rinse and repeat!

In the very beginning you're given the option to help the green army, and if you decline, you're given the option to help the red army (which will naturally turn them green.) Regardless of either army you choose, the other will gain twice the units and two of the four villages will close their doors.
For poops and giggles, I decided to go against both armies (keep in mind, whichever army you face gets twice the units). I sent my MU to deal with the Western army alone (reclassed for the 7th time as a Dark Mage with Lethality, Pass, and Lifetaker) and had the rest of my army turtle with their Knights, Paladins, Lord, and Mages.
Basically, MU took on an entire army by himself and came out without even having to use Lifetaker while my main army was able to hold their own against the other army (without the help of MU).
Anyway, once you get to Par. 13, just try this. I couldn't stop laughing for a good five minutes afterward and I didn't feel bad about ""wasting"" all that EXP on MU because you were only ever supposed to fight one army anyway.

It's not like I didn't give Classic a good try. I went to Chapter 9, including DLC and a whack load of random battles and paralogues. But invariably, when a character of mine was defeated it was for bullshit reasons. For example, Miriel gets attacked and kills the attacker with her counter-attack leaving the square open again. Another attacker promptly comes up to her and attacks again, which she deftly counter-attacks killing him, again leaving the square open. To which a third attacker comes up and killing-blows her. 

Now I'm fine with strategy. I'm fine with planning things out, positioning, all the good stuff with tactical rpgs like this. But it's the bullshit that you have zero control over that gets me. There is nothing I can do in a situation like that. If I were given the option to *not* counter-attack, then I might strategically stay my hand to prevent a continuous line of death-suitors from banging away at me. But I don't have the choice and I'm compelled to reset and begin the 20 min battle over again. 

I like the *idea* of the permadeath. And I like *idea* of the stress and impact the potential loss has on you while playing, keeping you on your toes and making success that much the richer. But the reality to me seems to not be that idea. I (like many people, it seems) don't have permadeath in the game--because I reset every time. In fact, in the end, this new Casual game has the same result as Classic mode; all my characters are alive. I just don't have the tiresome and punishing annoyance of repeating the battle.

I even made a bet with a friend that they'd release the Themed 3DS in the states, despite him being an 'Insider' in the industry (Read as: Reporter for a newspaper who specializes in Gaming and Media)

Anyways, even with all this scary talk about possible delays, and my local gamestop where I pre-ordered the console not being transparent enough. (Where pre-ordering, for me; is usually something I don't like to do.) I'm keeping my chin up.

Why? Because, my girlfriend is awesome.

Here's some background:

She's not a gamer in the traditional sense. She has a DSi that I bought her, and she enjoys Professor Layton, and Phoenix Wright games, as well as Just Dance on my Kinect. other than that; she doesn't play much. I also don't play games at all around her, time with her is dedicated to her. It's been almost five years now, and she realizes how much I love gaming and certain series, though doesn't quite understand. All the same, she smiles and supports it, and I appreciate that more than anything. (I don't rip on her for her Mob Wives/Real Housewives love subsequently. Only fair.)

Now, this isn't her request mind you, she's actually told me to bring games if I want, or to play when she's over. It just never seemed right to me. I've seen my brother go through 3 girlfriends in the same timespan I've been with mine. Each one sat on his bed and watched him play video games, and they'd occasionally talk/she'd play. Needless to say, all those relationships he's had have gone bye-bye. 

Anyways, to the meat and potatoes of the story. 

Liz knew how much this release meant to me, and decided to do something awesome. She wanted to help pay for the system. Originally, she wanted to buy it outright, and I refused. We're college students, and set strict limits on what we can spend for each-other. $50.00 at the absolute most. So after some deliberation, I agreed to let her help pay, since I'd already pre-ordered it. It bothers me she spent money on my obsession/habit, but It also makes me really happy she's so awesome about it too. I guess what really compelled me to come here is the way she presented the 50.00 to me. Not through just some check/cash, she sent me something special. The story is told by the Three pictures in the gallery linked at the end. 

I'm so excited this game is releasing, but this gesture has somehow trumped it for me. It's simple, but it's awesome enough for me. If the game doesn't release on time for me, I think this will definitely get me through the week.

I made several different scenarios that are listed below:

NOTE (These challenges must be done on Hard Mode. You may use a rogue or thief to open chests, but they cannot attack, and you cannot save scum if they die.) 

All Mage Run: Simply put, no physical units. There are 8 magic units in the game, so this provides a decent team with the right strategy. Keep your hero as low leveled as possible, and sell anything that can't be used by your mages. 

Female Only Run: Choosing Ephraims path, use only Female units. Pretty Self explanatory.

Male Only Run: Same as the above, but flipped.

No Promotions: Play with whomever you like, however you like. Just do not promote any units. (Recruits may be brought out of their base classes for balancing.)

Regional Character Roster: You may pick between using units that hail from Renais, or the other nations combined. 

These were just runs that I did personally, but they really changed my understanding of the whole game. It really gave me a new appreciation for the game. If you have any input on my Challenge Runs, or have your own, please share below! I would love to have your input.

I only get about 2-3 teams a week walking around on campus, but it's totally awesome and keeps me playing my main file to optimize my own team. (Shoutout to Avatar Paul from CO, who's team is the first I legitimately cannot beat)

Anyways, I've run into a slight problem. I'll streetpass a player and receive their team, but be unable to challenge them for awhile due to schoolwork, etc. If I let a few days pass, and log back in, POOF! They disappear from the map for no reason, never to be seen again.

So my question is this: What causes teams to up and vanish? I've had ones that stick around for weeks on end but some that vanish the next day. Was it that I ran into them again, and the new streetpass data somehow cancelled the old? Or did I just not challenge them In time? 
I'm scared I'm gonna lose Paul's team before I have the chance to fully optimize my own team to beat him.

Any help appreciated! Thanks!

1364674910.0,6,self.fireemblem,1bbi9u,Flatmates play FE: Adventures in the Multiverse,nottilus,11,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1bbi9u/flatmates_play_fe_adventures_in_the_multiverse/,"Someone in another thread suggested I expound upon my entertaining experience playing FE:A several times alongside my close friend and flatmate, Jay. I'm female, he's male, and we made avatars of corresponding sex to basically tear up this spectacular adventure-turned-dating sim from both ends. Hilarity ensued.

We got the game on release day and took up one file each. I started mine first, he started his a few hours later. (We both ended up restarting our first playthroughs, which were Hard/Classic, because as he said ""our bodies were not ready."") So I was alone in our living room, watching the first couple scenes, and Chrom reached out his hand to my fem-Sora-lookin' MU and then gazed into my soul with his beauteous eyes and captured my heart etc. I felt a little embarrassed at how thoroughly I swooned at this lord. But Jay had the same reaction (""le swoon"") so I felt a bit better.

So, having exchanged nudes with Chrom in the B and A supports (http://imgur.com/yWqy1yh SFW) the prince and I tied the knot sometime between chapters 6 and 8. Around that point Jay called dibs on marrying Marth, who was clearly a girl from the get-go (we assumed a Luke/Leia situation going on). Great, lord babies for everyone, let's go.

Jay then beat several more chapters, then decided to restart his game. When I caught up, the reason why was obvious. Having married my darling daughter Lucina and made more beautiful blue-haired babies with her, he had inadvertently made me his time-paradox mother-in-law, and become increasingly uncomfortable with it as the game progressed. Big, tough, grown-ass man, with his woobie wife whose real mom (he didn't really accept Sumia as a real thing) was me. Made things awkward over doing the dishes. Jay's avatar, btw, looked just like this (http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQfqXl89gS8A4iCZAr0tt9rZUtlKJyQwGCnq1KdOu1MbgB7QzrzOw), but with brown hair, and was not named Jay. We were unbelievably creeped out when I found this image.

On his second playthrough, he married Tiki, and we beat our games close to the same time. We both picked to land the final blow and were totally balls-rocked by that incredible ending. But whereas I ended up married to the prince and beating the game, he ended up marrying the divine dragon and transcending time and space in the game, by getting an ending in which he lived forever as dragons with his dragon wife.  I was so proud :')

tl;dr: Because we both wanted to marry lords, my buddy inadvertently became my son-in-law and restarted the universe to undo it.

We also had a friend playing the third file. He married Anna because SOMEONE had to see what was going on there, and put almost all his energy making Donnel his powerful tank bro. He beat it with just his MU, Morgan, and Donnel. It was some dumb shit.

Hmm let me think of some more joint adventures...

Then we played Lunatic mode! We did it on casual because we wanted to minimize hating ourselves. He beat it and is now working on Lunatic+, this time as a woman. I played through on Hard again as a man, just to play the field a little (I got with Cordelia and made a silly blue-haired Severa) and he spent Lunatic happily unwed. I have a Lunatic FeMu with Lifetaker/Galeforce but I haven't beaten it yet. It is difficult!
SO, our solution is, summon each other's old avatars into our games, and people it with awkward time-paradoxical relationships. The person who suggested this thread wanted to hear about our own stories getting woven in with the game story, but I think most of the rest of it was creative support/skill breeding of second-gen monstrosities. Anyway, we do and always have had a tendency to think of what happens to these characters on the battlefield as part of their lives and relationships, so Awakening has been our favorite and most rewarding game by far.

Comparatively, Taguel are much faster than manaketes, allowing them to do more damage. However, Manaketes have much more strength and defense, making them a much tankier and slower. However, Manaketes also have The newfound ability to make ranged attacks, giving them a bit more versatility than Taguels. 

Let's talk about skills. Their level five skills (even and odd rhythm) are fairly similar and boring skills, but their level 15 skills are where they differ. Wyrmsbane is a much, much, more niche skill. Only effective against other dragons, which is good for streetpass, but even so that's only good if they have another manakete on their team. However, beastbane is much more powerful, amplifying the taguel's already impressive damage against beast type units such as paladins and great knights. Also, they have the speed to take advantage of this skill, making it a very welcome addition to their skillset.

Overall, I think that the taguel is a much better class all around, due to their high offensive ability and decent survivability. For them, I'd give either sol, lifetaker, or renewal since they lack sustainability and aren't as tanky as manaketes. Also, lancebreaker to counteract beastbanes.

However, if you're looking for a very strong, tanky and versatile class, don't ignore the Manakete. With their ridiculous defense and resistance, as well as ranged capabilities, noone will want to attack it with anything short of a wyrmslayer. However, since they lack in speed I'd advise giving them Astra. Manaketes have ~40 skill, so they'll be able to take advantage of it. Also, Astra is even better on them because of their high amount of strength and their ranged attack. Also, swordbreaker for avoiding wrymslayer, and aegis and pavise just to make them ridiculously tanky.

What do you guys think? What skills are good on the two? also, who the hell do I father Nah with?
