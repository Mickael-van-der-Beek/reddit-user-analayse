1370273392.0,4792,self.offmychest,1fl2xd,"My step-daughter wants her ""Real Dad"" to give her away",godzilla_moon,14277,9485,2933,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fl2xd/my_stepdaughter_wants_her_real_dad_to_give_her/,"My step-daughter will be getting married on August 3rd. The wedding planning has consumed most of her and her mother's life (I say her mother because we aren't married, though we've lived together for 10 years) for the past six months.

My step-daughter graduated last December from University. I paid for her to go to college, though it was a state school, it still ran $40K. She does not have a job and has been living with us for the duration of her college career and since her graduation. I also bought her a car to get back and forth from school when she finished high school. 

From time to time her deadbeat father would pop into her life and she would fawn all over him. Although he has not contributed a cent to her education or paid any child support, though that is my girlfriend's fault as c.s. was not part of the settlement, she still loves him and wants him in her life. He stays long enough to break her heart by skipping town and breaking some promise that he made her. 

The wedding venue holds 250 people max. I gave them a list of 20 people that I wanted invited, you know, since I was paying for everything. They told me that was no problem and they'd take care of it. So I let these people know they'd be getting an invite and they should save the date. Saturday, I saw one of my friends on this list at the golf course and asked if he was coming. He told me that he wasn't invited. He told me that he got an announcement, but not an invitation. He had it in his back seat (along with probably six months of mail) and showed it to me. Sure enough, it was just an announcement, and my name was nowhere on it. It had her dad's name and her mom's name and not mine. 

This led to a pretty big fight with my GF, as I found out that NONE of my list of twenty ""made the cut"" for the final guest list because ""250 people is very tight."" I was pissed, but not a hell of a lot I could do because the important people in my life had already been offended. My GF said ""if some people didn't rsvp yes, I might be able to get a couple people in."" But that is an ultimate slap in the face in my opinion. So, I was boiling on Saturday.

Yesterday, we had a Sunday dinner with the future in-law's family and us and a surprise guest, the ""Real Dad."" At this little dinner my step-daughter announced that her ""Real Dad"" was going to be able to make it to her wedding and that now he'd be able to give her away. This was greeted with a chorus of ""Oh how great"" and ""How wonderful""s.

I don't think I have ever felt so angry and so disrespected. I was shaking. I took a few seconds to gather my composure, because I honestly wasn't sure if I would cry or start throwing punches or both. Once I was sure I'd be able to speak I got up from my chair and said I'd like to make a toast. I can't remember exactly what I said but the gist of it was this:

""I'd like to make a toast."" The sound of spoons against glasses ring in my years. ""It has been my great pleasure to be a part of this family for the past ten years."" Awe, how sweet. ""At this point in my life I feel I owe a debt of gratitude to bride and groom, because they have opened my eyes to something very important."" Confident smiles exchanged. ""They have showed me that my position in this family is not what I once thought it was."" And now a glimmer of confusion and shock begins to spread on the faces in the room. ""Though I once thought of myself as the patriarch or godfather of the family, commanding great respect and sought out for help in times of need, it seems instead that I hold the position of an ATM, good for a stream of money, but not much else. As I have been replaced as host, both on the invitations and in the ceremony, I am resigning my financial duties as host to my successor, Real Dad. So cheers to the happy couple and the path they have chosen."" I finished my drink. ""You all can let yourselves out.""

Is this selfish? I'm supposed to shell out 40 - 50 grand for a wedding that I can't invite anyone to? That I am not a part of? I'm so done with this crap. I'm done with my step-daughter, I'm done with my GF. I transferred the money out of our joint account last night. (she has not had a job since she moved in with me) This morning I called all the vendors I had written checks to for deposits to refund my money. At present it looks like I'll lose around 1500, for the venue, but the other vendors have been great about refunding. 

TLDR: You want your ""REAL DAD"" to be on the invitation, to give you away and to sit at the head table, fine, your ""REAL DAD"" can pay for everything too.

EDIT: The immediate aftermath was tantrum and people sitting there mumbling while not actually saying anything to me, but to each other. After much yelling with the GF about me being selfish, I spent the night in my home office and no one knocked on my door, not once. Today's aftermath is kind of depressing for me. GF brought me Bride's wedding planner to show me how much work I was ruining. I thumbed through it, found a page in the music section for Father / Daughter dances. All of the songs were catered to Real Dad's taste. So I thought they were just being disrespectful, but now I'm feeling like they never really gave a crap at all, especially since the menu included two ingredients I'm allergic to, that actually made me laugh. Either way, I'm glad to be done, returned the planner and asked her when she and bride could move out. Also, I never promised to pay for the wedding. I offered them the use of my home when they were sure it was going to be small, but other than that, all I've heard is how it's the Bride's family that should pay, so, let it be the bride's family then, aka, not me.

EDIT: June 9th 1:15 am. Girlfriend and Bride are now moved out. They are moving in with the groom. It was very hard not to be petty with some of the ""belongings"" they took with them, but it's done and I switched out the locks and now it's time for a brew. I can't believe how popular this story got, but I feel good to be given support by so many. If I find out what happens with the wedding, I will let you know, but I can't guarantee that I will put in the effort to find out. From what I've heard they are trying to ""scale things back"" and get his parents to help out. GF burned bridges when I found out she tried to write herself a check on our joint account the day after the unpleasantness. By then I had already moved money, so I guess I'm a bigger ass than her, but I could feel it coming. That's all.

This is a rather tragic story. It will not be suitable for light hearts. It's my deepest, most darkest history, which led to my own near-death many, many times. 

20 years ago, Germany, 1993. I was 20 years old. I had two sons. Their names will stay with me. But I will provide aliases. My youngest, Mathieu, was 14 months old. And his older brother Sam, 2 years of age. Mathieu was the happiest of children. He would smile at you even if he didn't know who you were. He was the sweetest, happiest little boy to ever cross into my life. Both of my sons were all I needed and wanted. My wife and I were 18 when she got pregnant. She was so happy, that I couldn't even grimace. I swore my self to her and married her when she was 6 months pregnant with my Sam. She was so beautiful then. Her smile could make a well kept man go mental. She was an extraordinary specimen. 

                         The Incident. 

 It was a freezing winter's morning. 19Â°F.  The roads were slick; the people's coats were packed on like the snow blankets covering the ground. I had work at 9 am that morning. I awoke to Mathieu; crying. It was 8:43. I had to be at work in 17 minutes. My boss had a no tolerance policy and would dock your pay for too many tardinesses. I knew I couldn't be late. 

 I got my son and myself ready and was out of the door by 8:51. I was rushing my son and I to my mother's house, time was ticking. My lateness was inevitable. My speed picked up as my worries did. As soon as I realized, I was going 50mph in a 30mph. I had no time to stop. I skidded over the crosswalk line into oncoming traffic. I whizzed by every other car coming from side to side. But instead I was headed for a large industrial truck. My whole life flashed before me, time was going extremely slow. I felt as if I was the Grim Reaper, watching this ordeal from an orb of some sort. And *I* chose my fate. I came back to reality to see me nearing the truck. I maneuvered my truck to hit my side of the his. Hoping to save me from my son's injury. It was no use. I survived, woke up in a hospital some time later with a broken  femur and head trauma. My son's neck was broken from the impact. He died instantly. 

I remember telling the nurse ""I want to see my son. I need to know he's okay."" She looked away, hiding her tears, and replied. ""Your son is no longer with us. He died instantly from the crash. I'm sorry"" I.. I honestly could not explain the feelings after that. To know that it was your fault. You killed your own son because you didn't want to be late for work. You didn't want to get yelled at by your boss. Like your job is worth taking your own son's life. After that day, my whole life changed. My wife blamed me and left without a trace. The next time I saw her, was 16 years later. She was sitting in a casket. She died from a fall while mountain climbing. The last time I saw her alive. She was crying and yelling at me, she wanted me to take my son's place. And frankly, I did too. I still do. 

Since then, I've had 3 suicide attempts, several broken bones. I sliced two of my fingers clean off. (Irrelevant, it was from an office guillotine.) Many run ins with the law, and overall, a broken, beaten, shrivelled up heart. A heart that is set in stone. And unmendable heart. 

He would've been 21. I could've taken him and my eldest son out for a beer, like good men. And we would be a family. I would've still had my wife. I knew she loved adventure, and I wouldn't have let her go mountain climbing. I still love my wife. I still think about we everyday. And I wish I could go back and fix all of this. But I can't. You never can. Life gives you the worst options, and you have to deal with them, or die. It's one feeling knowing that someone died because if you, it's a whole other, morbid feeling to know that it your own son. And that of a toddler. 

Though I shed many tears as I wrote this, it feels so amazing to just scream it all. The weight of this will only be lifted when I take my final breath. But only with the support of my remaining son, and my will to live, I will remain. Thank you all for reading.

Why? I ask myself, what is this going to solve? But for some reason typing this and facing this makes it hurt less.  I have four children ages 11, 7, and twin boys who are 3.  This year has been absolutely miserable.  After living with my girlfriends parents for years to get on our feet we did it at the beginning of this year.  

I was promised a promotion at work which would bring in MUCH more money and we could live comfortably, however that did not happen.  My brother was murdered in a Rite-Aid a few months ago, I suffered a broken leg and missed work for a month, and our bills fell behind and I fell into a deep depression.  

I have been paying rent, but late every month.  Often times not being paid until the 15th of the month.  I hate having to sacrifice paying either the power or water bill, or just not getting gas in the car for the week.  Christmas is now here, and my kids are asking me why we don't have a Christmas tree? How am I supposed to tell them that we can't afford one?

I have sold all of my stuff worth of any value to be able to pay some bills and I have nothing left.  My power is due to be cut off on December 10 because of a $400.00 past due balance, my water is due to be cut off December 10th as well due to $120.00 past due.  And of course all this comes full circle in December.  

I just got off the phone with my landlord asking in a not so happy tone when the rest of Decembers rent would be paid.  I feel like a complete and utter failure.  It pains me to my core, and nothing hurts more than seeing my kids go without.  I honestly don't think I can bare to look into their eyes on Christmas morning, and what I will say.  

Or what I will say on Monday when we have no power or water.  I am working two minimum wage jobs, and their mother is working full time as well, yet we are barely scraping by and can't get caught up because of the month with no income.  If there was only a way to get caught up we would be ok.  But playing catch up with past due balances in coming full circle.

I just wanted to vent, and perhaps cry a little, for the pain I feel for my kids.  I hate myself that I could of not done better, or I could have a better job with more income.  I am supposed to be a father and a provider and I can't even do that.  I am dreading Christmas morning, and wish I can just escape all of this.  

**UPDATE: Power bill almost completely paid up, and water bill paid in full. (http://i.imgur.com/PIaxZ.jpg) you are all AMAZING GREAT PEOPLE!!!**

**UPDATE 2: THANK YOU ALL!!!! The compassion is beyond amazing. Just a FYI almost all extra gifts, and some of the high priced items on the wish list will be going to my brothers family, my brother was murdered a couple months ago, as well as some of the money. I will also be paying all this extra generosity to others who need it around me as well. Pictures will be posted for proof. Your all amazing and many tears have been shed today**

**UPDATE 3: Honestly everyone, this is beyond amazing. PLEASE PLEASE help others who are on here needing assistance with bills and toys.  AGAIN - ALL extra money and toys will be going to others so I can spread your love.  PLEASE PLEASE help others out here who need it now, let's make this a night amazing for others as well. Thank  You for everything.**

**UPDATE 4: I see I am  getting a lot of hate now, but I am blown away by all of this. So PLEASE if you were one of the people posting on here about how you need help please PM your info and let me help you now.  I have lots of extra toys and money to help pay some bills. For the FINAL time all this extra compassion will be put to use to make this holiday just as good for somebody else, so please let me help now the best I can, PLEASE PLEASE DONATE TO OTHERS NOW!! We are beyond blessed at this point.  Let's make this an awesome one for others too!!**

**UPDATE 5: FINAL UPDATE: Thank you all again. i honestly can't say that enough I hope I helped some other people out as well. I need to get home and go to bed as I got work at 5AM.  Please No more donations you have all done so much already.  I am eternally grateful to all of you.  Pictures will be posted of Christmas and the gifts I have helped others with.  Goodnight and thank you.**

**ONE LAST UPDATE: I am trying my best to go through all of the submissions for help.  As of this morning over $1,800 dollars has gone to helping others with power bills, toys, car repairs, food money, and etc. Donations are also being made to a local community outreach center that helps with utilities and other hardships.  To answer just a few questions. People are skimming my pasts posts regarding me purchasing turn tables, records, and etc.  99% percent of those items were purchased at thrift stores and yard sales for pennies on the dollar.  That money came from many of the side jobs I do for extra cash, and everything that was posted was sold well over 6-8 weeks ago.

The reason I kept adding to the wish list was for the benefit of others that I know from my place of employment, in the neighborhood, and others who are need that can benefit from the kindness of others. The higher priced items that were added was in part from my daughter sitting in during my phone calls as I told her ""add some stuff your brothers and other kids would like"", she is a kid she didn't know any better.  

I am at work on break but I am trying to fill as many Christmas wishes with verification as possible, if I don't respond or can't help out I am sorry, I am trying everything I can.  The IndieGoGo is in the process of being hidden.  Once opened they will not close it once donations have been made, but they can ""hide"" it so no more donations will be made.  I sent the request by e-mail last night and I am hoping it will be taken down. For those sending negative hate, threatening e-mails and messages, and even death threats, please put that negative energy into helping others.  For everybody that donated and contributed, and sending positive message and vibes I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  You are all wonderful people.  Pictures will be post once the holiday nears of others receiving goods, and etc.  Thank you and happy holidays to all of you**",,False,,t5_2ranw,1354890355.0,,,True,t3_14dvq0,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14dvq0/as_a_father_of_4_i_have_failed/,

I really don't why to be honest, but here's the full (long) story.

Harvest Moon saved my life.

I was bullied since I was a freshman in high school. I don't know the reason, it might be because I was fat, I was ""weird"", a nerd, a lesbian, take your pick. I was depressed, I was angry, I wanted to kill myself, and I tried but I seem to have a tolerance for sleeping pills. Soon I just gave up. I feel like I wasn't alive, I just existed. I sometimes cut myself or eat just so I can make myself feel better.
Gaming was my only escape from hell. Everyday after school, I would play my PS1 and for that time, I was genuinely happy, where I can feel alive again. Well one day, some of this kids beat me up and locked me in the old janitor's closet. Now a lot of people know that I have claustrophobia, so I was terrified for hours until they let me go, I cried when they just left and making me feel worthless. I thought for that moment, I would hang myself.

No more pills, no more cutting, just tie a rope to my neck and end it all. When I went home, I passed by the game store I frequent and saw a game on display. ""New Arrival"" it said on the case, it was a copy of Harvest Moon: Back to Nature .It was a simple cover art, it has Comic Sans, yet it mesmerized me.
Now I didn't know why I bought it, maybe make it like a ""last meal"".

So I took it home.

I put it in the CD, tearing up since I know this was my last day, and this was my last game.

I started to play.

As I played, I felt better just taking care of my farm, and helping the people of Mineral Town, getting to know them made me pretend I had friends. As night fell, I completely forgot I want to hang myself.
It was like magic. I now ignore all those bullies, and just get excited on playing Harvest Moon when I get home.I was doodling pictures of them, planning my farm.
In Mineral Town, I had friends, I have love interest, lots of animals and vegetable to take care and make happy.I won races, shows, I played the ocarina in church, went to festivals, got married and had a kid. It feels as though my real life is there inside the game.
I was living my ideal life.

I loved the feeling that people need me, and I need them. I found my courage to stand up and believe I have the right to live. I was reborn in Mineral Town, and made my real back to the real world to be a new and better person.

A happy person.
In time, I found my courage and because of an incident where I just punched a bully in the face, I was left alone.
I grew up, and made real friend, a real love interest. I have self-confidence and self-esteem. I am happy. I moved on to the PS2, the Xbox, the 360, the PS3 and PC. Even though I still have some psychological damage and issues because of the bullying, like anger problems. I try to keep them in check for my sake and others.
Now whenever I hear the soundtrack from Harvest Moon: Back to Nature, I cry. I cry because they made me realize that I can be happy, and I am. I realized that it saved me from death 10 years ago.",,False,,t5_2ranw,False,,,True,t3_1fzg4a,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fzg4a/a_video_game_saved_my_life/,

Ever since I became an adult about a decade ago, my mother has been against me moving out of the house.  I finally got a job as a line cook three years ago.  My mother (and rest of family, which includes my sister and father) has been against it, mainly saying that such a job cannot sustain me (which was true).  They also said that I would hate working, which turned out to be false.  About a year and a half later, I quit due to health reasons.  The following spring, I got a new job as a computer programmer.  While they seemed supportive at first, my mother and sister (who I lived with) gradually became hostile.  Eventually I moved out of the house.  About a month later, I lost my job, and about three months later, moved back home.  

Everything was cool at first, but as I was getting calls from recruiters and going to job interviews, they gradually became more hostile again, accusing me of being distant and not caring for them.  However, they seemed to be very controlling, and hateful of the fact that I wanted to move out and wanted a decent job.  So last month, I finally got that job as a programmer again, but it was out of town.  I had just enough money to relocate to the new city.  They became very hostile starting a few days before I left, accusing me of not loving them, of hating them.  On the day before I was scheduled to leave my mother gave me two of the styrofoam ramen noodles cups, and tore that cardboard covering that normally comes with it and threw it away.  I was suspicious that they would try to sabotage my life, so I was careful in not trying to anger them.  She gave a few more food items (which I didn't use) to take on the trip with me.  When I arrived at my new city and entered my hotel room, I chilled out.  I was to go to work the next day.  So, after the first day at work, I ate a cup of ramen noodles, and felt ill.  I knew that feeling because my sister fed me something that made me feel the same way in late 2011, which I then assumed was because of my recent illness.  I felt weak, light headed, and ""short of breath.""  I drank water to make me feel better, because that's what I did last time that happened to me. Over the week, my mother kept calling me, making sure to remind me to eat my ramen noodles (I was short on cash then, waiting for my first paycheck).  I never told her that I ate it.  I suspected then that I had been poisoned, and after doing some Googling, believed it was cyanide. 

Now that is something that you should never have to think, that your own mother would do that to you.  So I resisted that thought, because I simply could not bear to think that.  So, I went to http://cyanidetest.com/ and ordered a kit, and I tried it.  Now, look at the graphics and the video on [this page](http://cyanidetest.com/cyanide-detectors).  

Now, here are the results of my test: http://imgur.com/dNf1Dwy

I guess I am going to have to call the cops, and I will never speak to my family again.

I was on my way to the gym (I usually go it the mornings, but slept in yesterday) and was driving onto an elevated freeway. At the top of the off ramp there was a young woman crying and looking over the side. She could have been a hitchhiker or just walking but I had a bad feeling and got right off the freeway.  I drove to near where the onramp was, parked my car and ran. By the time I got below the freeway she had one leg over the side. I ran faster. I ran in front of cars until I got on the on ramp. I ran until I was 20 feet from her. She had one leg over the side and the other was on it way over. 

I tried my best to smile and said hello. She wouldnt speak at first she was just crying. I asked if she was ok or if someone was trying to hurt her. She didnt speak so I kept talking. I told her my name. I said I wanted to help her. I will buy you dinner, what kind of food do you like. I will listen to you for hours and you can tell me whats wrong just please come down. She looked over the edge and I grabbed her arm. You are beautiful. I love your shirt and your hair. What is your name? ""Jane"" (name changed for privacy) Please let me buy you dinner. she kept crying And then I started just rambling about my dog ( I was so scared). I told her about how sweet he is and how he was so friendly and he loves pets. I told her I bet he would love you. 

Finally she agreed to let me buy her dinner and came back over the railing. I held her hand and we walked down the on ramp. There was a CHP officer waiting at the bottom. She started to get scared and wanted to go back. I made her look at me and I swore I wouldn't leave her side. I would stay with her every step of the way. I spoke to the officer and sat with her while another officer showed up. They asked what happened and Jane had me tell them. They had to take her to an ER and wouldnt let me sit with her in the squad car so I followed after I gave her my name and number. 

At the ER she was poked(for blood) and questioned and x rayed. She asked that I stay with her through all of it. I listened as I found out her history. Rape, loss of a child, abusive relationship (back injury from bf throwing her down stairs), in and out of foster homes. In between doctors and nurses we chatted. I showed her pictures of my dog and we talked about childhood pets. We talked about our favorite salads. About silly things. Once about God.  She told me about the man she was scared of. The reason she was on the bridge. He had threatened her family because she left him. She thought if she killed herself he would have no reason to hurt them. She loves her family and spoke with great pride about their jobs and her niece and nephew. She loves animals and children. She said one day she wanted to have a job to help foster kids have a place to go to be safe. and so they wouldnt get into trouble. She spoke about being at a group home and helping with the little ones that came in. About a three year old with rashes from neglect (being allowed to sit in his own waste for long periods of time). ABout kids being abused and feeling like they had nowhere to go. She said that after she was raped she felt like she was a target because people knew she had been vulnerable. 

We spoke for hours. I left when the nurse brought in a bed for sleeping. I asked her to call me when they sent her to a new hospital and I will bring her dinner. I promised her on that bridge I would buy her dinner.

The whole thing is surreal. I had no idea what I was doing. I was barely keeping a smile on my face, I was so scared she was gonna jump while I was right there. I wanted to cry. I wanted to cry when she told me about the abuse. I hugged her but I wanted someone to hug me. 

I want to tell people what I did. I want to tell them how scared I was and how she opened up to me afterwards but wouldnt say more than two words to doctors and nurses. I want to say, I think I saved someone's life. I feel proud. I feel happy. It happened last night on the way to the gym. I listened to my gut and I stopped my life to help a stranger and she is safe now. 

edit: THank you all for your kind words. They mean a lot to me. My closest friend is also a coworker and after I told her privately she convinced me to speak to my supervisor and ask for the day off. I am still very shaken and emotionally drained. I keep replaying what happened over and over in my head. I feel anxious. I will update you all when I have more news about how Jane is doing.

It'll keep you hard and a little bigger than normal. The problem is I don't own any cock rings. No problem! I'll just take my keys of this key ring and it will do! Fit great. When I was soft. But now I'm hard, and I can't get it off. And the only way it will come off is if I am soft, but the ring is keeping me hard. Chicken or the egg. Fuck. 

After a couple hours I'm getting blotches on my skin so I get scared and go to the ER. Apparently extended erections are considered serious and I was quickly brought to an exam room. I'm hoping I get some old dude or woman so there's no sexual tension because I was embarassed enough telling my story to the triage nurse. Nope. In walk a resident and a nurse. Nurse was early twenties and the resident was late 20s. Thankfully they are courteous and polite so not too bad so far. They've likely seen worse anyways.

They first tried ice to get it soft but it didn't work. The resident then tries to bend out the ends of the key ring with pliars, to open it up enough for me to slide my junk out. She can't get a proper grip. ""No problem nursejizzer, we have a few more things to try. We're going to try some lube next.""

Fuck. This resident in her late 20s is now lubing my shaft and trying to tug the key ring off. This isn't stimulating me at all... no clearly not making me more aroused or hard...

Doesn't matter. Key ring won't budge. Her and the nurse leave and they come back with a drill that has a diamond tipped bit. They tell me this will cut the key ring off and I'll be good to go. WELL GUESS WHAT. Drills vibrate. So now I've got this nurse and resident taking a fucking vibrating drill to my dick. I could tell I was going to orgasm before much longer, but I'm in enough discomfort and the drill is too loud that I'm unable to tell them to stop. Yup. Eventually I got to the point of orgasm and I splooged all over the nurses scrubs. She had to go change. But they got the key ring off. 

My dick is purple and blue and hurts like crazy and has a few cuts from all the work the ER did trying to get it off.

The initial slow stunnedness is wearing off. It's been about 15 minutes. I started prioritizing my condition. Forklift on top of me, crushed my feet, forklift ROPS on top of my upper ankles. 

Look closer, just before you fell, you twisted your ankle. When it hit, it finished inverting the foot. That is the top of one foot and the bottom of the other you are looking at. 

I fucking screamed again. It's been about 20 minutes.

There is gravel under my feet. Pry. Pry. Pry. a miniscule pile of dirt is starting to form beside my feet. Suddenly realize that I may bleed out as I relieve pressure on my feet. Stop prying. My fingernails are turned back. I hadn't felt it in my state. I have to be more careful. It's been about 30 minutes.

My feet are utterly crushed. I estimate the height of my feet inside the boots to be about 1/2"" high. But I could not get my head in a position to assess the situation better because the steering wheel has pushed my hips into the ground. But there is some give there. I wiggle it a little. Stop. Take a breath. Look around. 

Where's my Nextel? Out through the mast of the forklift, I see it. How far? About a body length. Fuck. My feet are pinned but not the shins. Maybe 35 minutes.

Class of '03. I've tried to put high school out of my mind. I had a horrible time. 

I was the chubby girl; pimples, weird hair, too tall, I never felt comfortable in my own skin. There was one girl in particular who made sure to point out all of my flaws and announce them to the world. This girl was what you would consider a stereotypical mean girl. She was blonde, curvy, and pretty attractive. She was a ""good Christian"" girl that, coincidentally slept her way around the school's male population. 

I don't know why she did it, but she really had it out for me. That girl was the reason why I cried myself to sleep some nights. She was the reason I made myself throw up dinner once or twice. She was the reason why I wanted to transfer schools. 

Senior year, she had it all together and I was a mediocre student headed for community college. She was on her way to a big private university. 

When we graduated, I managed to get admitted to a local state university. I pulled myself together and lost a few pounds. I grew into my awkward height. I graduated in '07 with a degree in Human Resource Management. I'm now working with a great company and going back for my Masters soon enough. 

This morning I stopped for breakfast with my fiancÃ©, and our waitress was that girl. She had gained quite a few pounds. In fact, I didn't even recognize her until she started the conversation with, ""Hey, didn't we go to school together?"" Yeah, we did, bitch. You ruined it for me.

But I just smiled and carried on a pleasant conversation. She told me that she went to that private school but dropped out a year later. She got pregnant and had two kids. She's taking online classes to get a degree in teaching. She works two jobs. Single mother. I went through the motions and told her that that all sounded nice. 

When it was time to go, I debated on tipping her or not. Inside, I couldn't believe it had turned out the way it had. My mom always used to tell me that in high school, the people that think they're ""all that"" end up with the short end of the stick. I never believed it, but it actually happened. 

I ended up leaving her a $10 tip. I'm by no means ""OK"" with what that girl did to me, but I shouldn't punish her for it, either. That makes me no better than what she did to me. I can tell she's tired. She has a family. I secretly hope her children have a good life. I hope their mother finishes her degree and doesn't have to be a waitress anymore. 

I forgive that girl I knew in high school. Because, let's face it, high school sucks ass. We all grow up at some point. 

All the best to you, sweetie. :)

In front of me, a homeless was counting change and trying to see what he could afford with the coins in his hand. He ordered food and the cashier rang it up for $7. He began looking through his coins, counting out how much he had. It became obvious that he didn't have enough to buy food.

I thought to myself, ""why am I depressed? Over a girl? When this man has nothing to eat? I cry myself to sleep because she fell out of love, while this man counts coins to get a decent meal?""

My 3 year anniversary is coming up next month. Our engagement was short (4 months) but very emotionally taxing. I cried long hours because I was so stressed out. Sometimes about the plans themselves, but more so about the prospect of the marriage not working out. I was so upset about the whole thing, we ended up just getting married, not telling a soul, and just calling everyone from a local hotel after. 

My husband, then fiance, would just tell me we were different. We weren't like all the other couples. We weren't like our friends or family that had been through divorces. He could never tell me exaclty why, he said he just knew. 

Last Saturday night my husband and I went out with only each other, talked on a patio of a restaurant for hours into the night, eventually made it home, had a passion fueled episode, and finally fell asleep around 2:00 am. I woke up early Sunday morning to him whispering in my ear how much he loves me.

It's amazing to me that after 3 years of marriage, we enjoy each others company enough to be able to talk with only each other for hours, are attracted enough to each other to still have and enjoy passion fueled nights, and love each other enough to work through everything else.

HEY: I'm not hitting on you, I'm just making small talk.

It's insulting because all I say is ""so how are you? Big plans tonight? how was your weekend?"" and other things to fill the awkward void while they are putting their debit through the machine.

STOP FLATTERING YOURSELVES.

Get your head out of your asses and realize that just because you're a ""hot young female"" that I'm not hitting on you, I'm probably just trying to make small talk.

1375130008.0,1267,self.offmychest,1jatvd,I am NOT proud of my son.,Captain_1958,1566,299,401,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jatvd/i_am_not_proud_of_my_son/,"This Saturday, my son will have been sober for 18 months.  He got his GED this year, and he starts at Community College at the end of August.  He finally has a job that I didn't get for him, soon he will be moving into his own apartment, and he hasn't missed a single appointment with his therapist.  He has done everything you would expect of a precocious 17-year-old who hit a rough patch after meeting with a particularly bad influence.

 He is 29.

This is the point where I'm supposed to say that, nevertheless, I'm *still* proud of him for turning his life around, getting off drugs and off the streets, staying out of trouble, and acting like a responsible adult, or at least an adult who knows the meaning of ""responsible."" Maybe I'll throw in a reference to the Prodigal Son and kill a fatted calf for him. That's certainly what's expected of me.  That's certainly what my *son* expects of me.  He ~~wants~~ demands praise and forgiveness and a party and me to hug him and tell him it's all right.  Demands me to tell him how proud I am that he's made something of himself.

But I'm not, because he hasn't.  Not in the slightest.

His mother and I gave him every opportunity we could.  I don't expect any praise for that, because unlike my son, I don't expect praise for *doing what you're supposed to*.  She and I worked hard to give him a loving, stable, comfortable, supportive home.  We were involved in his school, we introduced him to music (to the extent that any two people can; his mother was a damn good cellist, though) and sports and culture, we fed him healthy meals, we played with him--thanks to him, we got in the best shape we'd ever been in since our 20s--and we let him stumble and fall and make mistakes and *get back up again*.   

He started shoplifting at 15.  The first time we caught him, we bodily dragged him back to the store, made him return the copy of Grand Theft Auto and apologize, and offered to pay for any damages.  The second time we caught him (this time with a pair of shoes), we did the same thing.  The third time, we started going to family therapy.  

Therapy seemed to go well, and after a few sessions the therapist asked for a few one-on-one meetings with him.  After two of those, the police came knocking on our door, because the little shit had concocted some story about how we were a religious cult who raped him for breakfast every Saturday ... and the dumb chickenshit therapist actually believed him.  Rational heads prevailed, we fired that therapist, and he went through six more in as many months, until eventually we couldn't find anyone who would take him as a patient.

By 16, he was drinking.  Then we found pot in his bedroom, and in *our* bedroom.  He started leaving needles, bongs, and crack pipes where he knew we'd eventually find them, just to fuck with us.  I know this because he said so, in those exact words.  He had his first intervention and first trip to rehab that year, and his first relapse.

He had to repeat a year of high school at 17, which meant he was now the ringleader of a group of other young dipshits, who saw him as this totemic mentor-shaman who could hook them up with whatever shit they wanted.  I'm also damn sure he started fucking one of his gang's younger sister (13) around then, but I had nothing to go on but my own instincts, so all I could do was tell her parents to keep an eye on her.  No charges were ever pressed, and the family never spoke to me again after that, but they did pull both of their kids out of that school, and my son was furious at me for daring to not let him continue committing statutory rape.

He decided to try for ""normal"" rape later on.  While I was away, he spent an uncharacteristic night at home and on his best behavior.  After his mother went to sleep, he followed her to her bedroom.  He took a knife with him.  He crept into the room, straddled her, put the blade to her throat, and slid his other hand inside her. 

I don't know exactly what happened next.  I know he held her down and tried to undress her.  I know she fought.  I know he stabbed her. I know she got away and locked herself in the bathroom before he could catch her; I hope that means she kicked him good in the balls.  I know she broke the window and screamed for help.  I know he ran.  I know she was lucky the ambulance got to her before she bled to death.  I know he called his friends to brag and beg a ride.  I know the police caught him.

I know if I'd been home, or if *I'd* caught him, I'd have killed him with my bare hands.

The state tried my son as an adult.  He pled out, but only after making his mother testify and smiling the whole time.  She divorced me a month after his sentencing; I looked too much like him.  She killed herself a year later.

I would be a liar if I said I didn't blame him for her death, because I absolutely do.  He was sober when she went to her room, sober when he pulled out his knife, sober when he climbed on top of her, sober when he raped her, sober when he stabbed her, sober when he ran, sober when he called his friends to brag, and sober when the police found him.  When I made the mistake of visiting him after the divorce, he laughed and said she'd had enough of his dick that I could never satisfy her.  When I made the mistake of visiting him after she killed herself, he laughed again and asked how it felt to have ""some prick take your bitch away.""

I should have killed him right there.  It is to my eternal shame that I did not.

They let him out after serving three years.  He spent the next six years on the streets, in and out of rehab, on and off other people's couches, and would grace me every six months or so with a phone call demanding money.  Eventually I refused to talk to him unless it was to drive him back to rehab, and I stopped completely after he stole my wallet.  

Two years ago, he came to my house with his aunt (his mother's sister) in tow and crocodile tears in his eyes.  He pretended to apologize.  I slammed the door.  His aunt barges in to try to shame me into forgiving the man who raped my wife, caused her death, and laughed about; he stayed outside.  He slashed my tires, threw a brick through a window, and drove off in her car.  His aunt had no idea that he'd taken or keys, or that he'd been armed the whole time.  She blamed me.

He guilted her into letting him stay with her, went to rehab and relapsed, then went again, and here we are.  

In stark contrast to the ball of shit that is my son and his life, I have watched my friends' and colleagues' (those who will still talk to me, that is) children go on to become doctors, lawyers, skilled tradesmen, actors and musicians, academics, entrepreneurs, and career military.  I've seen a few start their own families.  And even the ones who've had a rough start, or who stumbled and fell, managed to pick themselves up again, or are bravely soldiering on.  I have nothing but respect for them.  I also note that *they* do not expect juice and a fucking cookie for having a job and not getting hopped up on meth or raping their mothers for 18 whole months.

My son has pretended to reform before.  He has even convinced himself once or twice.  But he always backslides, always relapses, always finds new ways to disappoint, always hurts other people for his own short-sighted benefit.  His aunt is already at the stage where she is pretending she ""must have forgotten"" where she put some knickknack or piece of jewelry, and has already told me to fuck off after I've warned her of what my son can, will, and has done before, and what he will do again now that he thinks she is weak.  When he fucks up again, when he hurts someone else with his ceaseless bullshit, I will not be there to pick up after him.  I am through with him.  I am through with his aunt.  I cannot talk to her without being overcome with rage and shame as I see the stupid, stupid hope I used to have that my son would ever amount to anything, and I do not need any more disappointment and failure in my life.

1372897573.0,1219,self.offmychest,1hlq7e,My mentally retarded cousin was just allowed by my family to STEAL MY FUCKING 3DS WITH NO PUNISHMENT.,I_upvote_the_world,1653,434,532,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hlq7e/my_mentally_retarded_cousin_was_just_allowed_by/,"I just made this account for this rant.
But I have this cousin. She's sixteen years old. She is severely, and I mean SEVERELY retarded. Like She is still in diapers, not because she can't use the toilet because she knows damn well how to and occasionally does, but she doesn't want to and cries and throws a tantrum whenever someone tells her to just use the fucking toilet. 
Anyway, everyone in my family ADORES HER. She gets everyone's favoritism. Everyone wants HER to be happy. At birthday parties, regardless of who's birthday it is, everyone gets her a cake and presents so she doesn't freak out. 
So today we went to a family gathering for my uncle's birthday. My family had been reminding me for weeks before to not forget to get Lizz (my cousin) a gift. 
So you know what? As a little protest, I bought my Uncle the best gift I could afford. I got him a fancy toolbox with little compartments and shit. And Lizz? I got her NOTHING. Because it's NOT HER BIRTHDAY!!!
So when everyone is giving her gifts, I'm on the couch playing my 3DS, which I bought with my own money, As soon as My aunt tells her, ""Okay, Lizzie! No more gifts, that's all of 'em,"" Lizz FLIPPED OUT and she started screaming, saying she didn't remember opening her gift from me. So my Aunt asks me where my gift for her Is. I tell her I didn't get one for her.
So at this point, Lizz hit me really hard and took my 3DS and started yelling that it was hers and she wants it and My Aunt tells me to show her how to use it.
Now later when I'm getting ready to leave, and Lizz has happily been playing Animal Crossing, I ask for my 3DS back. She says no. So I told my family and I started getting yelled at, and they all started telling me that it was ""only fair"" that I let her keep my DS, because, oh get this, apparently it was ""selfish and cruel"" Not give Lizz a gift. 

So now that stupid fucking retarded bitch has my brand New 3DS and my Animal Crossing, and there's nothing I can do about it because everyone worships the ground she walks on and only cares about HER. 

I honestly wish she was never born or was put up for adoption or something. I'm not mad that she's mentally handicapped, I mad that shes a spoiled piece of shit.

EDIT: I'm not mad at her AT ALL for being mentally hanicapped, because I know she'll never be able to live a a full life. But I'm pissed that she stole my DS and now my family is punishing ME instead of HER. I get that she's disabled. But she's not a god.

EDIT 2: Just had a flaring argument with my Aunt, because as you guys predicted, the 3DS died. We came to an agreement. If I mail over a gift or something, she'll give back my 3DS, but I cannot bring it to to her house as long as I live, which is understandable, and I may never ""give her something without all it's parts, or I will very well come down with Lizzie so you can apologize in person.""

EDIT 3: Just got back from the post. The package with a dollar-store frisbee and a candy bar are on its way to Liz. I should get my 3DS back in the mail sometime next week.

*****EDIT 4: I just want to apologize for being insensitive about my cousin. It's not her fault she was raised badly, causing her to be that spoiled.  I should have just gotten her a small gift in the first place, and not brewed any trouble. Also I'm sorry about using the word ""retarded"" as oppose to a more politically correct term, or even a less asshole-ish term for that matter. I just need to give her and my aunt a break, I get that now. I just had a phone call with Lizz, and she said she can't wait for her frisbee to come in the mail. Honestly I was just a complete dick to get that angry over a damn *toy* and I really need to gt my priorities straight and I should stop being narrow minded about the whole thing. 
Mind you, I still don't think what my aunt is doing is okay, but come on. Like a lot of you said, Lizz will never be able to have a full life, unlike me.

Anyways, I've been able to get through to most of my students except for this one kid.  He's super-quiet (scores well in assessments relative to his class, though) and participates sporadically.  He's not disruptive and he's attentive for the most part, but sometimes he's prone to ""disappearing"", if that makes any sense.

Anyways, he wore this shirt yesterday:

I'm not a Brony and I don't really have a strong opinion about their fandom (to each their own) but I knew this was my way in.  Some quick research at /r/mylittlepony and I thought of a way to quickly bond with this student.  

I assigned group work and while I was walking around checking on the groups, I walked up to this kid and put my fist up and said, ""Bro-hoof"".  He gave me a fist bump and I swear his face lit up brighter than even I thought could be possible.  He smiled and ever since then, he's been a model student.  It's so crazy to see how a fist bump (Bro-hoof, if you must) can have just as much importance as all the educational and pedagogical theory I've had to learn to be a teacher.

Victims like me are invisible. Nobody wants to admit what happened to me can happen. Everyone talks about cultural tolerance, stigma, fear, and control like it only happens when a girl gets raped by a guy. It kills me when I see facebook pictures and rants about men and rape, because I know that as long as that's how people think about it, nobody will ever do anything about the rapists like the one who raped me. Those rants make me feel so invisible. I'm not against trying to stop rape. I just wish someone would try to stop things like what happened to me.     
    
""Marie"" was the daughter of my mom's best friend, except that's not the way it was. Mom was like a fangirl to her friend. My mom was single and broke, and she wanted to be in on stuff in our town. Marie's mom was divorced and successful, involved in all kinds of city stuff, politics, business clubs and social stuff.     
    
Marie was almost a year older than me, but she was in my class. She was also a bully. When we were little she always controlled the games and stuff that our friends played at recess. She pushed other kids around and made us feel bad if we didn't agree with everything she said or picked to do. Stuff was only fun if it was Marie's idea.     
     
As we got older she started pecking at my self-esteem. I was skinny and nerdy with boring hair. I wore boys jeans and didn't need a bra until I was 17. She started wearing a bra when we were in the 4th grade. She got curvy and started buying clothes in women's sizes in the 5th grade.     
     
Marie was psychologically abusive. She said stuff like she was trying to make me feel better, but there was always something mean in everything she said, like ""Don't worry about your flat chest. Boys will like you better when you get older and grow boobs like mine."" She used to give me advice about looks and then make fun of me to other people behind my back when I followed it, like when she talked me into bleaching my hair, then told everyone I didn't have the skin for a blonde. She sabotaged my friendships with other people by telling us opposite stories, so we each thought the other did or said something wrong. She told boys I liked that I thought they were pigs, and boys who were mean to me that I had crushes on them. Marie was popular, and I was seen as her socially awkward friend. Everyone thought she was so nice for tolerating me. She told people she had to be nice because she was my only friend, and what would I do without her?     
    
In a way she *was* my only friend. She manipulated me into letting her control my life. She pretended to be protective, but she was possessive. If I spent time with other kids without her, she questioned me about it like a cop, and sometimes did them, too. She threatened boys who talked to me too much and made nasty accusations. She always had to get between me and other girls. She would warn me that they were just trying to find things about me to gossip about. She would trick me into making myself look bad and then tell me what the other girls were saying about me. She had me thinking she was protecting me, but all the time I walked on eggshells to keep from setting her off.     

That all started when we were in 5th grade. Mom got a new job that had her working out of town, sometimes pretty far. There were a lot of nights when she wasn't home. Marie's mom let me stay over a lot. Marie had a double bed, and her mom put us both in it together. Until we had our first sex ed class in the fall, things were okay. One day the class was separated into boys and girls, and we got the talk about periods and pregnancy. I don't know why or if this is normal, but we also got told how to masturbate, and that we should do that instead of having sex with boys because it wouldn't give us diseases or get us pregnant. I remember at the time that sex and masturbation both sounded gross to me. I decided I was never getting married. Marie laughed at me for that and told some of the other girls. Some of them agreed. Some of them called me weird. I felt like a freak, but I didn't defend myself. I didn't even know what to say.     
    
The next time we had an overnight, Marie started pushing me to touch her. When I pulled away and told her no, she shoved me, grabbed my arms, rolled over on me and pinned me. There was no one to call, because her mom was at a meeting and my mom was out of town. I fought back but she was stronger and heavier. I could hardly breathe with her on top of me. While I turned my face away and cried, she forced my hands inside her pajamas. When I didn't do what she wanted, she let go and hit me until I obeyed. She told me what to do, and I did it until she came. When it was over, she comforted me like it had been someone else who hurt me, instead of her. She also told me that if I tried to tell anyone about it, she'd say it was me who started touching, and she had to fight me off. She convinced me that my bruises would prove what she said. It was twilight zone weird, and I didn't know what to do, so I just didn't react. I didn't tell anyone what happened, just went on like everything was normal.      
    
This isn't anything like what they show in lesbian porn. I didn't start liking it. She didn't do anything for me, and even if she had, I wouldn't have wanted it. I wasn't ready, and I am straight. I didn't want anything about what happened. It was horrible, scary, humiliating, and gross, but I was afraid to talk to anyone about it. Our town was really small. We only had one building for school. Everyone knew everyone else, and almost everyone went to the same church. Everyone knew and respected Marie's mom. Other adults treated her like gold because she was her mom's daughter. Anything I said would have made me look like a liar and a freak, especially if she lied to everyone about me. I knew they would believe her. She already had people convinced I was different. Even my mother said I was ""too quiet.""      
     
The one time I did try to talk to the junior high guidance counselor about it, she called my mother and said I was having sick fantasies. I heard her tell my mom that they needed to keep me quiet so I didn't ruin Marie's reputation, because she was such a ""nice"" girl. Mom took me to a psychologist, who spent a year of very traumatic sessions curing me of my ""delusion"" until I gave up trying to get help and went along with what she said to me. My last session was writing a letter of apology to Marie. Even though I never had to give it to her, the helplessness and wrongness I felt was bad enough to give me nightmares about the whole town finding out and coming down on me like the shrink did. I was always afraid after that, wondering who the guidance counselor had told and which teachers might see me as a lying freak with lesbian rape fantasies. Sometimes the thought would hit me in class, and I wouldn't be able to look at anyone. It made me very awkward sometimes when teachers called on me for questions. I got yelled at a lot for not answering loud enough to be heard. Ironically, Marie was the one who would commiserate with me between classes about what a bully the teacher was when that happened, and even though she was the one causing the problem, she was the only one I had to turn to for comfort.      
    
The abuse continued for years. As we got older, she escalated it into other stuff, making me wear things that hurt, making me go down on her, slapping me when I gagged, mocking me when I cried. It stopped when we were in high school, when my mom's job transferred her out of the area, and we moved. Finding out that we were leaving was the most exciting day of my life. We would be far enough away that I would be free from Marie. I was scared to start over in a new school, but I decided that I'd rather just not have friends than face another night at her house. I also decided I was never going back to that little town again. In the end, I had some friends. I did okay the last years of school. I even have a friend who has been through something like what Marie did to me. We are each other's only moral support.    
    
I'm not writing this to make you feel sorry for me. Now that I am older I feel stronger and am starting to recover. I'm taking classes and moving on with my life. I just wanted you to know that sometimes, rape has nothing to do with men, and the anti-rape campaigns that only talk about men help keep victims like me from getting any outside help. I wanted to say it someplace where maybe I won't be shouted down or shut down for talking about it, and where I would get a chance to explain why I was saying it.

Over the past year, we've had an apartment fire, watched every possession we had burn up. Our lease was up three weeks ago, we found out they would not renew our lease due to my wife losing her job and us not making as much money as last year, forcing us out. We've been living in an extended stay, which I'm paying $1590 a month for, which I cannot afford to do, basically eating thru our savings to the point where I have -$21 in my savings, $11 in my checking account.

Today was my sons birthday, I've sold nearly everything I own to try to get him a present, I was able to afford a cake, when I went to get his present, I realized I'd lost my wallet. I sat in the parking lot of Gamestop for over an hour crying. I'm crying now. I don't understand why we can't catch a break. I was so excited, I was going to finally replace his DS that he lost in the house fire with a 3DS XL, mario, and pokemon. It's all he wanted.

I know he was heartbroken, but he refused to show it. Later that night I heard a wimper come from his room(the extended stay is a 3 room hotel room). I sat outside his door, and listen to him tell his brother that all he wanted was a DS, and that he didn't care that we couldn't get one, but that right now he misses his memaw(grandmother, who died recently) because she always made his special cake.

We're running out of options, we won't end up homeless, but we may end up in a shelter before I get paid, then we'll have a house...but listening to my son cry, knowing he was heartbroken. It killed me, I feel so guilty. If I hadn't lost my wallet, he would have had some joy in his life. I feel like somehow I took that away from his special day. I couldn't even afford cupcakes for him to take to his school today. 

I'm a complete and utter failure of a father, and it's eating away at my soul. I am so, so very sorry T. One day you'll understand what we're going thru, but today that doesn't matter, today I wanted to shield you from it, and give you some joy. I know purchasing the 3DS would have been slightly irresponsible, but we've only got a week before Daddy gets paid big boy. And then we'll have a house, with your own room. 

So to my 9 year old son, I love you son. I wish I could have shielded you from daddy's luck. I wish I could have made you happy today. I'm so sorry son. I'm so very very sorry.

But, she wasn't entirely safe.... She sprang off the car's hood like a little gazelle and landed on her feet. 

My reaction surprised me. Instead of freezing in my seat and staring or looking around confused or running away from the accident, I stepped forward to the scene to help. Without thought.

The woman driving the car stopped and got out of her car, running towards the little girl, horrified at what she'd done. Another woman who witnessed the accident called police and spoke to the girl while I spoke with the panicky driver. The woman was in tears and could barely breathe. In a calm voice, I told her that she had done the right thing. She stopped. She didn't drive away and the girl was talking, and probably in shock, but didn't appear to have a scratch on her. I told her it would be a good idea to move her car to somewhere safe (not blocking traffic) and she went to move it. When she came back I tried to comfort her by just putting my hand on her shoulder. I told her to breathe. Next, I noticed she was wearing a work uniform and suggested she call work to let them know she'd be late. She did, and soon the girl's mom, police, and paramedics arrived. 

The mom could see how horrified/frantic/tearful the poor woman was and saw her seemingly uninjured daughter and gave the frightened woman a big hug. The woman who hit her daughter with a car! Her instinct was amazing. So kind and generous to someone who could have potentially taken her child from her.

She got a 5 minute phone call, but you couldn't put in the effort to drive 10 miles to see your daughter before she left to another state.

An hour ago i realised i can twitch a muscle in my right thy. It's not a big deal but its the first time i have been able to control any muscle below my level of injury. I am so excited and just had to tell someone... it probably wont come to anything, and i don't care about that, but it is nice to know that i did not fully fuck my spine. 
__________________________________________________

Edit 1: also I was told throughout my time in hosipital I had a complete injury, effectly a severed spinal cord as I had not feeling or movement below my injury level. This changes that, which will make a difference in thefuture for chances of getting more movement with medical advances. 

I had also heard after two years if nothing changes it is very unlikely that anything will change, and it has been 1 year and 11 months since my accident. So yea, this is very exciting for me even if nothing more comes of it... I will carry on having fun and enjoying the wheelchair, this will not change that :)

Edit 2: when I hold and dangle my leg the muscle movement is very noticeable, although it is still far too week to balance my leg up-right, which is what I will try tomorrow (the joys of recent graduate unemployment). After some googling and twitching I think it's my sartorius muscle, the one on top of my thigh, the one behind my thigh doesn't want to play.

When I put my left leg up I can twitch the muscle a bit but not much at all, I can't see it when lying down or sitting, whereas I can on the right leg (even though I feel a low lower on my left side as my right side is far more damaged).

 I will call my consultant tomorrow and also after two years they often take the metal out of patients back (I have 6 or 8 titanium pins holding me together) and so maybe stuff could change after that? I'm just sitting in bed awake unable to sleep twitching away... Although I think when my leg is propped up it is enough to call it tensing the muscle ;)

Edit: lower down i explained what happened with my accident... here is me 10 mins after waking up in intensive care, about to find out? or just found out i couldn't walk again? thumbs up anyway, i did a silly,  http://i.imgur.com/QENV9qc.jpg


Edit4: so I just woke up and it wasn't a dream, which is great news ;). still movin' the muscle near non stop, it's the sartorius muscle, according to google. The left one also moves a little but barely. Will call my doctor today and will try to balance my leg upright to see if I can stimulate the nerves and muscles 

edit5: just spoke to my consultants secretary, my consultant is on leave, my appointment is booked for the 6th of September. This will be my two year check up where they xray and ultrasound my kidneys i think to make sure i'm fully functional. Until then i will just try and do my own thing and see what else happens. I will also discuss at that appointment getting the metal taken out of my back. I could see my normal doctor whenever i want but he will not have experience with spinal cord injury patients so i will wait until the start of Sept

I don't hate black people. ~~In fact, I actually do have a couple black friends.~~ They are awesome and kind and loving. But it's black culture that really gets to me. The whole White vs. Black mentality. If you do well in school and go to a good college thats ""acting white"". The whole gangster projects mentality, and anyone who wants to work hard to get out is a punk going against reality because it's apparently fucking impossible to move up social classes even though people fucking do it. I know poor ass kids who worked their asses off in public school, got into a good college with money and landed themselves a good job. It's not fucking impossible--just hard.

The Martin trial brought this to light for me. If it was a black guy killing a white man, would that be a hate crime? If there were recent break-ins in your neighborhood, and the description of the criminal was blond haired and blue eyed, would you be charged with a hate crime against white people if you stereotyped and followed a white guy? Would white people take to the streets and protest against this terrible thing? Fuck no. Maybe I'm racist and please feel free to tell me that. I'd love to change my opinion because I HATE that I think this way...but to me it feels totally right.

edit: I was just trying to say I'm not a blanket racist...which made me sound like a blanket racist. Lol.

edit 2: A lot of people are saying that this is poor or gangster culture. Well, those are possibilities I'm willing to entertain, but I'm not entirely convinced because when Jews/chinese were the poor immigrants they did not have such a high incarceration rate and they worked hard to lift themselves out of poverty. I'm inclined to link to someone's comment here about why this culture came to be, where he theorized (really condensing the comment) that it was because of all the oppression that african american's have faced in the history of the U.S

A couple of years ago I was around 14-15 and watched the show Secret Millionaire on Hulu. I don't remember too many of the details but I remember the millionaire was helping this low income man distribute toiletries to the homeless in whatever town they were in. The man saw that one of the homeless men had stepped in shit and his shoes were absolutely ruined so he asked him his shoe size. The homeless man said he was a size nine and without hesitation the other man took his shoes off and handed them to him. 


I remember I started to tear up when I saw that and told myself that before I die I need to do something like that. 

So a couple of nights ago I was with my two friends and we were walking to my car from a concert around 10 at night. We are approaching my car and I am supposed to give both of them rides home so they are trailing behind me. Within ten feet to my car a man was pushing a cart full of trash bags, and what I assumed were his belongings, without any shoes on. 

At this moment without hesitation, almost instinct, I go straight up to him.

""Excuse me, sir!""
He looks at me.

""Do you have any shoes?""

""Well,"" he hesitated. ""Not really"" 

""What's your shoe size?""

""Like a twelve I think""

I swear it was meant to be because I am a size twelve. I had a pair of [Nike Shox](http://www.lookjordan.com/images/Sneakers/Nike%20Shox/Shox%20Agent/Nike%20Shox%20Agent+%20Men%20Shoes%20in%20Grey%20and%20Blue.jpg) that were in really good condition and slipped them off and handed them to him. 

He looks at me and I just smiled ear to ear. 

""You sure man?""

I replied ""Yeah keep 'em!"" and shook his hand. 

He said thank you and I walked to the driver side of my car and told him to have a nice night. 

My friends were telling me how they were holding back tears but in the spur of the moment I honestly forgot they were with me. 

Sorry for the ramble but this easily is the best moment of my life thus far. The reason I put this in /r/offmychest is because I never told anyone and I don't plan to, plus no one has noticed my ""signature Nike's"" are gone haha.

Thank you for helping me get a job, never thought I'd say that. 

*Edit 01/04/2013:* I just wanted to let everyone know that the manager has finally contacted me. He apologized over and over again. He also scheduled me for another interview next Wednesday at 2pm. I am currently trying to decide if I should go, also, I'd like to thank everyone for their kind words and for sending messages to Cracker Barrel. I probably wouldn't have received a call back if it wasn't for Reddit.  

*Edit 01/04/2013:* I've been contacted by Cracker Barrel and they are trying to work things out and figured out what went wrong. I posted a full update on my [blog](http://hellozachary.blogspot.com/) 

**Original post below:**


Got there 15 minutes early and didn't leave the building 'til five o'clock. You are probably thinking, ""Damn, must have went well!"" You'd think, huh? Well, I never actually had my interview. Let me give you a timeline of how I spent my 2+ hours at Cracker Barrel. 

**3:00pm:** A server tells me the manager should be out soon.

**3:05pm:** I tap my foot gently to the country music they have playing inside.

**3:07pm:** I watch a man eat two buttermilk biscuits in less than 60 seconds. He looks happy.

**3:10pm:** The little peg game they have on every table is tempting me, however, I decide not to engage because I don't feel like that would be appropriate.

**3:15pm:** A female sits down next to me and she reveals that she has an interview scheduled for 3:15

**3:16pm:** I try not to make eye contact with her because I am shy and afraid of people. 

**3:17pm:** Shit...shit! I made eye contact and now I must say something so I don't look creepy.

**3:18pm:** Do you live around here? I ask her, which doesn't help me seem any less creepy.

**3:20pm:** Another girl comes up to the round table. She reveals that she has an interview scheduled for 3:30

**3:22pm:** I wonder what came first; the cracker or the barrel?

**3:23pm:** A server tells us that the manager is in a meeting but should be out real soon.

**3:24pm:** I start to prepare myself for the interview. Firm handshake, don't sell yourself short and make eye contact. 

**3:26pm:** A waiter talks to me and the two girls. Tells us not to worry about the interview, makes a few jokes and then leaves to go refill some more biscuit baskets. 

**3:30pm:** I begin to wonder what is taking so long. Also, is he planning on interview us all at once? Because no one told me this would be a group session thing. I'm not good in groups. 

**3:33pm:** The two girls at the table start to talk with each other. I look down at the table and try to look busy. 

**3:40pm:** One of the nice waitresses looks at me and says something like, ""He still hasn't seen you?"" I shake my head and go back to looking at the table. 

**3:45pm:** Another girl sits down at the table. She says that she has an interview scheduled for 4pm. I begin to wonder if I am getting Punk'd.

**3:50pm:** The new girl asks how long we've all been there. We tell her and she seems shocked.

**3:53pm:** One of the girls begins to complain about waiting so long. I kind of laugh but inside I am thinking, ""Shit, I've been here for an hour!"" 

**3:55pm:** We're offered something to drink by the wait staff, but we all decline their offer. I think we're all trying to be ""professional looking"" but I start to question whether the manager even cares about being professional. After all, it's not very professional to leave someone hanging for over an hour. 

**4:00pm:** An attractive female in the gift shop looks at me. Does she like me? Nah, she is too attractive and too tall. She probably wonders why my shirt is so baggy. It's because I have the upper body of a 14-year-old if you happen to be reading this now.

**4:01pm:** I look back to see if the attractive female is still looking at me. She's not. 

**4:05pm:** We're offered drinks again, and again we all decline. 

**4:06pm:** The girls at the table start talking about how ""ridiculous"" this is. And then they start talking about past jobs, I continue to sit there in silence. 

**4:08pm:** A waitress says she thinks that he's still in the meeting, but should be out soon. 

**4:09pm:** I say, ""He better hurry up, we're going to run out of chairs."" I get a laugh from one of the girls. I consider it a successful joke. 

**4:10pm:** I look back in the gift shop and notice the attractive female is looking at me again. Do I have something on my face? Or a ""kick me"" sign on my back?

**4:13pm:** A customer at a table nearby orders hot chocolate and it looks so fucking good.

**4:15pm:** Another waitress offers us drinks and we finally accept the offer. I just got some water. I was thinking about the hot chocolate, but it comes with whipped cream on top and I didn't want a cream 'stache during the interview. Oh, yeah...the interview! Wasn't that supposed to take place at 3? 

**4:18pm:** I glance back at the gift shop and see that the attractive female is still in there. I try to keep the dirty thoughts away; this would be a bad time for a surprise boner. 

**4:20pm:** Everyone at the table agrees that this is a bit ridiculous. Why hasn't he at least come out to say he's running a bit (or a lot) behind? We all question.

**4:23pm:** We all agree that we should get the job just because of the long wait.

**4:25pm:** I make eye contact with one the first waitresses who talked to me. She gives me a, ""What the fuck are you still doing here?"" look. I look back at her with a, ""I have no fucking idea"" look. 

**4:30pm:** One of the girl's cell phone says it's 5:30pm. We all panic and wonder if it really is 5:30. It wasn't...her phone was just messing up. 

**4:32pm:** I watch someone eat some pork chops. I don't really like pork chops, but they looked pretty good. She seemed to be enjoying them.

**4:34pm:** The attractive female is still in the gift shop. I start to wish I had confidence. 

**4:39pm:** Still no sign of the manager. 

**4:41pm:** I finish my glass of water and begin to twirl the straw around in the ice. I stop a few minutes later because I think people are getting annoyed.

**4:45pm:** We all are getting extremely annoyed. We're left there waiting...and waiting. 

**4:48pm:** One of the girls goes outside for a smoke break.

**4:50pm:** Girl comes back inside and asks me how old I am. I inform her that I am 21 and shes like, ""What? You look so young and innocent"" I laugh and think to myself, ""I wonder if she would still think that after looking at my browser history."" 

**4:55pm:** I decide that if the manager doesn't come out by 5pm then I am leaving. 

**5:00pm:** No sign of the manager, so I stand up and wish the girls at the table good luck. They're like, ""Are you gonna call back up here later?"" I tell them, ""Probably not"" and walk out the door. 

**5:03pm:** I think about how I just wasted over two hours waiting on a shitty manager who doesn't have the decency to at least come out and apologize. 

**6:30pm:** I arrive at home and eat me a bowl of corn chex with sliced up bananas. Still mad...but my anger decreases with every bite. 

**7:57pm:** I post this on Reddit.

**10:23pm:** I'll probably be in the bathroom thinking about the attractive female in the gift shop. 






**** EDIT: ****

**6:10am:** I Wake up, check Reddit and can't help but smile at all the wonderful comments.

**6:13am:** Still smiling.

And by the way, your eulogy SUCKED. She was never ""a simple lady who was content with the small things and loved taking care of her children and husband.""

It was weird to me. The way they spent so much money on food and toys and stupid beds, spent thousands of dollars on vet bills if need be. When people said their kids were like their children I'd gag. The worst was the cliche ""I didn't rescue my animalâ¦my animal rescued me"". Sure. Whatever dude.

A few months ago, my friends found a cat. She was only a kitten. After a few rounds of ""who the fuck is taking the kitten"", I volunteered. I'd had cats when I was younger and was moving into an apartment that allowed for pets. And like, I liked cats, you know? Cats are some of the few animals I can tolerate. They do their own shit, eat, whatever. I didn't really think about it.

Well, I moved into my apartment. I live by myself. But not really.

Almost every morning, this fucking whorebag wakes me up around 7 AM by crawling on my chest and purring. I get out of bed and feed her, because I'm her bitch. I usually fall back asleep. Sometimes I don't. If I don't, she decides it is PLAY TIME. PLAY TIME consists of her taking her mouse toy and flinging it around like she snorted cocaine, ripping up any plastic bags/paper I've stupidly left on the ground, or my personal favorite: jumping into the bathtub and meowing as if she is Jean ValJean in Les Miserables and I, Javert, have locked her in the tub for eternity.

She eats flies, jumps up on the kitchen counter, drinks out of my water glasses, knocks shit over, but the thing is, she's family.

I have really bad PTSD and bi-polar disorder and living alone would've been really, really fucking horrible. No one knows how bad my anxiety is. Having a cat makes me get out of bed on the days I physically feel unable to. I have to go to the grocery store to buy her fancy can food, which makes me buy myself food. She's affectionate as hell and is better than any pillow or teddy bear. Panic attacks aren't so bad with a little soft kitty. There have been times I've thought even though I really want to, I can't kill myself because I've got to take care of my catâ¦ no one else could do as good of a job as me and I know she'd miss me. 

My friends would laugh if I told them all this and there's the fact that they have no clue about the PTSD and bi-polar so here this is. I didn't rescue my cat. She rescued me. She does every day.

I was in the right lane, the roads were empty minus me and my girlfriend. We were in my parents pilot (much safer to drive in questionable times than my little civic.) I had taken the highway because I thought it'd be safer/clearer than the less driven back roads that I normally take.

I looked into my rearview mirror and saw headlights behind me for the first time (it was like they appeared out of nowhere, but honestly I didn't know how long it had been since I had looked.) I looked away but double-taked back to the rearview mirror to see the headlights disappear as the driver slammed into the back left side of the car. My car spun and ended up perfectly upright and mostly on the shoulder of the road, the other car slid and ended up in someone's yard.

The driver got out, and eventually was hauled away in the police car. He was too drunk to answer questions, he didn't have a license, and it was his fourth drunk driving offense. The pilot was totalled by the insurance company, my girlfriend sprained her neck a little and was better within a week. I didn't get hurt. I could've been in my civic and I imagine that going a tad worse.

Anyway, the thing that I haven't really been able to say to anyone because I, one, don't really have any opportunities to mention it, and, two, think it would just sound weird. I'm glad that the drunk driver hit me. My family is well off enough that the destroyed wasn't anything other than an inconvenience, I didn't get hurt, my girlfriend didn't get seriously hurt, and now this guy will probably get thrown in jail. The way to his house was filled with slippery roads, stop lights, and a city. If he didn't hit me, he could've ended someone's life and ruined their entire family and friends lives.

Edit;
I am going to call a cab and take her to the vet again. I don't think I can say i saw what happened but I will tell him I think that maybe a friend did something to her like that and get them to check her better. 
I never thought she could get hurt enough from it to die but now I am really scared for her. 
If she is okay and not hurt then I will think about it but if she is really hurt inside I will tell dad somehow. If he wants to throw me out I will take her with me and keep her safe at least. It was me who screwed up letting him come over so if somebody has to die for it I want if to be me not her.

They are a wonderful couple and even when money is tight they make sure these children get to live normal lives and have fun. They take in kids from troubled homes, the kids no other foster family wants.

Over the last few years they have had a set if 3 sisters in and out of their care; being tossed from their bio mom and back to them. Mom was a drunk, she got herself cleaned up. Our friends currently have her oldest daughter in their care because she still holds a lot of anger against her bio mom. Today, Fathers Day, bio mom took her youngest (5yrs old) to a picnic party at a local park. Busy chatting with ppl and not watching (!!!!) a man dragged her daughter out of view, stuffed his fingers down her throat to silence her, and raped her....FIVE YEARS OLD YOU SICK DISGUSTING PIECE OF SHIT!!!!!!

At the hospital the first person she asked for (she could hardly speak bc of his fingers ripping up her throat) was our friends. She wanted her foster daddy there to make sure that the man who hurt her couldn't get to her. The police know who it was, but have been mum on whether he's actually in custody. Our friends didn't even know what had happened until they got to the hospital. They had simply gotten a call saying she was in the hospital and asking for them.

This POS has caused so much damage to her reproductive parts that she will need extensive reconstruction surgery, and may never be able to have kids of her own later in life. This perverted fucking sadistic waste of life raped and ruined a child's life! She already had issues, she had already seen and experienced pain in her short life and this THING comes swaggering along and inflicts the unthinkable!!

Dads, please hold your kids extra tight today. Never let them out of your sight or out of your arms. Love them with everything you have and more. Please...,

**EDIT** Thank you all for your kind words. It means a lot. I watched this little girl grow up from diapers, to pull-ups, to potty trained. She's a beautiful child, inside and out. And despite all the turmoil she has been exposed to up until this she still managed to be a happy child. We are all just praying that with the proper care, and love that one day she will be able to hold her head up high and smile again. 

**EDIT 2** Many of you have been asking if there is anything you can do. That gesture alone restores faith in humanity. Since the situation is still unfolding, I need to speak to her foster parents. Obviously, bc of her age we all want her ID to remain secret. I promise to keep this sub updated on the case and if you live in the Tri-State area you may hear about this on the news. I think she would love some happy and upbeat cards just to brighten this dark time, but I also want to respect her and her family's need to have some time to come to grips. Hopefully within the next week I will be able to provide a mailing address if some of you want to send your well wishes. I know she will be so happy to know there are so many ppl out there thinking of her, sending her strength and love. :)

**Edit 3** I never imagined when I posted this that it would get such a reaction and outpouring of care and support for S. (that's how I'll refer to her). As you can imagine her bio mom and foster parents have been with her at the hospital since yesterday so I've been unable to have a real talk with them. I was informed the monster is in custody!!! The police however have not told them if they got a confession yet (they don't need one. DNA has him dead to rights). I'm going to propose the both sets of parents that perhaps the best way Reddit can help would be letters to the future Judge in this case asking to throw out any attempt at plea bargaining and ask for the max sentence allowable by law upon conviction. I don't know if this is the best way to help, but I'm sure it's a damn good one. No cozy rode in a mental facility; prison, max sentence, PERIOD.

It became too much for her. She hung herself in her bedroom.  

While this sounds completely and unforgivably fucked up, it was the absolute meanest, most selfishly asshole thing that anybody has ever done to me. To me, to her mother, to her sister, her Godson, her boyfriend, her friends, and her entire family.  To her dog. She left herself hanging there, tragically dramatic, to be found, and that sight is not something you can un-see.  Iâve been so unbelievably angry at her recently, I need to get this off my chest.

It was pretty meticulously planned out.  She had cleaned her room, wore a nice outfit, wiped her iPod, even changed her profile picture on Facebook.  All of this planning went into her suicide, all of this thought.  
She had been in trouble for a long time. Suicide was something that was almost constantly on her mind for years.  She was also beautiful, a talented writer, a fantastic tennis player, the best friend that Iâve ever had.  A sweet girl, a little derpy, who was socially awkward and had big dreams and a tiny bank account.

See the thing is, the person who kills themselves leaves all the real work to those they leave behind.  She wasnât thinking about who would have to clean up after her.  The police officers and EMTs who were horror struck, people who have taken pledges to serve, protect, heal.  People who serve their communities and neighbors, trying to keep the city clean and safe and healthy, instead being called in to cut down a 22 year old hanging from her hammock.  Human beings who donât know what to say, canât even look at the people who called 911. Who have to take pictures of it, by law.  I know that police officers are supposed to be badass, used to trouble in all forms, but I have never seen that kind of absolute horror on someoneâs face before.

She planned out her outfit, but not what would happen to all of her clothes. She didnât think about where her dirty laundry would go.  Who would pack her stuff up, how long it would take them, how unbelievably nightmarish that particular process would be for us.  What do we do with her toothbrush? Her favorite shoes, all worn out and dirty, by the door?  All of her belongings, 22 years worth, dresses and books and shampoo, packed in boxes and sitting in the living room of her motherâs tiny apartment. A literal mountain of grief.

She didnât think about who would have to call her mother. She didnât think about how completely impossible it is to bring up âoh, by the way, your daughter is deadâ into a conversation. She didnât think it would take three days for her mother to find out. She didnât have any idea how expensive funerals are, how it would wipe out everything her immigrant family has broken their backs struggling and saving for decades. How many details go into planning them.  The impossible situation of trying to plan a wake, funeral, and burial when your world has literally come to an end. 

When you die, you donât disappear. Itâs not actually the end.  When you die, someone has to find your dead body. Somebody has to get you to a hospital.  Somebody needs to fill out your paperwork, find you a funeral home, get in contact with everybody you know. Somebody needs to find you something to wear.  Somebody needs to plan your makeup.  Somebody needs to pick you out a coffin. Make sure you get in that coffin. Hire a car equipped to drive that coffin around.  Find you a grave.  Get everybody you knew into a cohesive, informed organization.  Make sure that your mother didnât succeed in following you.  Figure out where the fucking world you buy tombstones from.  Itâs all the work of planning a Super Sweet 16 at a momentâs notice except your heart has physically been ripped out of your chest and all your guts are leaking out everywhere.

When you die, people who loved you have to look at your dead body.  If you die in an exceptionally sensational way, such as suicide by hanging, this causes extra gut-leaking.  

When you die, your roommates have to live out your lease, or uproot their lives to get the fuck out of there.  When you die, your Godkids still have birthdays.  When you die, your mom still tries to call you on Sunday afternoons. 

I almost would have preferred that she had been murdered. It would be possible to accept her death as a murder.  There were ways she could have made it look like an accident.  

I sound like the most selfish fucked up excuse for a human being, I know. Itâs been a few months, and I have gone from previously inconceivable terror and grief to absolute fury. Of all the things that I have ever experienced, I feel like this might actually kill me.  I am so angry and pissed off because I feel like there was absolutely no purpose behind this.  Intellectually, I know that she was sick, but personally, I know that she didnât have to die. There is always somewhere to go. There is always another course of action.  All those issues that loomed so large before she died were temporary situations. Time goes on no matter what, and nothing lasts forever.  She could have gone home to Peru, to her motherâs house, she could have joined a fricken convent or even just taken off like a gypsy.  She could have joined one of those silent meditation shaved head type deals.  She could have pulled some âInto the Wildâ type shit. She did not have to die.

Of course, there is another explanation.  Maybe she WAS thinking about us.  Thinking about this is what fuels my fury, itâs the only way that the nameless, paralyzing, nauseating feeling can manifest in my consciousness. She knew we would find her. She knew we would have to clean up after her, call her mother, look at her lying there on that steel table in the basement of the hospital with a giant ridge in her neck and her tongue split in half.  She needed us to know that it was our fault.  She needed us to know just how badly we had failed her.  She was so angry with us, this was the only thing she could do to demonstrate the depths of her disappointment in the people, the society, she thought we were. She needed to show the world how it had betrayed her.  She wanted to punish her family. She wanted us to suffer.

And you know what? We really, really are.


Anyway, that's my dirty little rant to the internet.

We had a single conversation. 

I will admit, though, that while short, it was one of the most memorable conversations of my life.

I honestly never thought I'd see him again, but I thought about him often. Not like you might assume, though. His image became that of a father-figure. The dad I wished I'd had, but I didn't dwell on it, because, really. I was just a stranger to him, too.

But then I saw him again last night.

It was only for a few minutes, but I walked up, smiling and excited to see him again. I didn't think he'd remember me.

But he did.

He did and he said he wished we had more time so he could hear the story of what had happened since I'd seen him last.

And then he did the worst possible thing.

He hugged me and told me he was proud of me.

And in that moment I realized that was what a hug was supposed to feel like. That **that's** what it feels like to be held by someone who cares about you and who you care about in return.

I'd completely forgotten. 

I thought I was *special*, that I didn't want or need to *touch* other people; hugs were something to make *other people* happy, but I had no desire to seek them out myself. I didn't *need* anyone else, I was just fine on my own. 

But in that moment I wanted nothing more than to keep holding on. I wanted to hear him say it again, to tell him how hard it was and how I just want to be someone *good enough*.

But I didn't. I had to leave, and so did he.

So I walked away, and cried. I cried all the way home like a child.",,False,,t5_2ranw,1372307270.0,,,True,t3_1h5q2a,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h5q2a/last_night_a_hug_from_a_stranger_shattered_my/,

I was so scared of her as a kid because she was big and would scream and hit me for no reason (that I could ever figure out). She would kick me when she walked past and giggle about it, she would threaten me with a knife or scissors. She punched me in the face and tackled me when I was seven, I still have the scar on my eyebrow where I hit my head. My parents never did anything because she couldnât understand why what she was doing was wrong, but I know for a fact that she knew some things. I watched her punch herself on the arm and then start fake crying and run to our mom and say that I hit her, and of course they believed her. She constantly stole stuff, my stuff, my parents, etc. She dumped bleach on our clothes. She would get up in the middle of the night and come in my room and stare at me in the dark. We had to put a lock on the fridge and pantry because she would literally eat and drink herself sick. Our cat once had babies and she stomped on one of the kittens til it died. I still remember seeing its eyes pop out of its head. She didnât understand enough to be fazed. I could go on for hours telling stories.

And she was fucking disgusting. She would regularly go into the bathroom and wipe shit on the toilet seat, the walls, the door handle. I mean what the fuck! She also hoarded the nastiest things. I once found a purse stuffed full of her USED PADS. The SMELL. I canât even describe. She would go through the trash can and âsaveâ things that she liked, including rotting food. She would blow her nose into her hands and rub them together like it was soap. She also had some sort of weird fungal thing on her nails that never really cleared up, despite going to the doctor numerous times and getting medication. Her nails were all yellowed and warped and cracked for years, like something out of a horror movie. I hated her and I'm certain she disliked me too. She was just so mean, like a 5 year old bully in an adultâs body. Yet whenever she met someone new she was all smiles and hugs, so everyone always told me about how friendly and precious she was. The worst was how sexual she could be. She would practically try to molest me, she would rub on me and grab between my legs. Sheâd flash me or try to pull down my pants or wiggle her butt in my face. I donât know where she could have learned it from, probably the TV she watched all day. But my parents just told me âShe doesnât understand, you canât blame herâ and made her leave the room whenever I yelled for them. I remember this as young as six (and you can bet every time I pushed her away or hit her then I was the one who got in trouble) and all the way up until I graduated. It happened to friends that I brought over in high school too. Most people were (understandably) extremely uncomfortable by it and wouldnât come to my house after it happened to them.  

After I graduated I moved out and went to college. I thought about it for a long time and decided that I was just jealous because she got everyoneâs attention, which is true (she does get all the attention and I am jealous). I figured that now that I had spent time away and grown up a little that things would be different, that I could handle her and be patient. But everything is still the same. She still punches me hard enough to bruise, she still spits on me and thinks itâs funny, she still shits all over the wall, she still steals things out of my bag and shows me her boobs. She does all this to my parents too but somehow they can just accept it, they get annoyed for a bit and tell her to stop, then they forget about it. Well not me. I hate her and I hate how everyone tells me sheâs such a blessing, and I hate how everyone expects me to get involved with raising her after our parents can no longer do so. I already told our parents that that will never happen, but they seem to think that if we don't talk about it and they don't make any other plans that when the time comes I'll be forced to take care of her, out of duty or guilt or something. If so they are grossly mistaken.

I found $300, and I need to get this off my chest.",Senyin,950,154,364,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1d23mu/so_i_found_300_and_i_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest/,"I don't know where this belongs, I had it in /r/AskReddit but was told to move it here because I feel like getting this off my chest. The other day I went to my college classes just like I do every day, except, on my way through the parking lot... I saw a $20 dollar bill floating across the ground. I snatched it up, and sure enough, it was real... and then I saw another... and another. I kept picking them up and soon I saw a giant pile of $20's getting swept up by the wind and taken under cars. It took me a while, but I gathered it all up. I had found $300 in cash in the parking lot.

First thought I had was ""Holy shit"", and I wasn't even sure what to do. On one hand I felt like I should keep it, and on the other hand I knew that it would be incredibly wrong of me to keep this much money when it had obviously been lost somehow. I debated on what to do as I made my way to the college, and finally decided I was going to turn it in to the lost and found.

When I told the lost and found that I had found money on the parking lot and wanted to turn it in, I don't think they were expecting this much. The girl who was there had to get her supervisor, and he was in shock I had even turned in that much. They told me to give them my number in case no one claimed it in 24 hours, and if no one did then I could have it. After I turned it in, I went to my class as normal.

As I was heading to my last class, I receive a phone call. It was a random lady, who asked if I was the one who had turned in the money. I told her yes, and she just started crying on the phone, breaking down in tears and thanking me from the bottom of her heart. I was shocked, I didn't think it would mean that much to anyone. I came to find out however, that this woman had been loaned that money from her parents to buy medication for her sick baby, and had lost it in her rush to get to class on time. 

I don't think I have ever felt so good about something in my entire life, I don't think that $300 dollars could have made me any happier if I had kept it. I got a call from the college later that day who wanted me to come by, and gave me a stuffed black bear with the colleges logo on it as a gift for turning in the money.

Now, you are probably wondering why I need to get this off my chest... Well I will tell you.

After this incident, I was so happy and proud of myself that I told my friends, my mother, and my grandparents. None were happy with me. My friends told me I had done a stupid thing and should have held onto the money, that I could have bought all kinds of games with it. My mother told me she was 'sort of' proud of me, but thinks I should halve kept the money since I had found it. My grandparents were just flat out disappointed in me, they thought it was stupid I had given back the money. They said I could have put it towards something I wanted, and that it was the woman's fault for loosing it. No one cared about the baby who was sick, or how grateful the woman was for me turning the money in. No one gave a shit about the fact I had tried to do something good, everyone expected me to do the exact opposite and be selfish and keep the money.

So now, I am stuck sitting here questioning if I even did the right thing. No one seems to support me, everyone thinks I did something stupid, and even my boyfriend says I should have just held onto it. ""Finders Keepers.""

Was it really so damn wrong of me to actually do something selfless? I don't regret it, because I know I would have regretted it if I had kept the money. I would have felt like I was stealing from someone. But it is bothering the hell out of me that no one seems to think what I did was right...


Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who has replied. I really was not expecting so many responses... but to see how many people believe I did the right thing, it is taking a huge weight off my shoulders. I really was starting to think that I had done the wrong thing due to my family/friends, but after seeing all these comments... I feel so much better about turning in the money. Thank you everyone.

My 14-year-old daughter has been lying to me about everything, and I just want to give up and run away.

Last night, I got a phone call from the parent of one of her friends, telling me that the other night when her kid stayed over at my house, she ended up getting a phone call from her daughter at 3:45 in the morning. Her daughter was alone and scared in the middle of the city after being ditched by my daughter. Apparently they'd snuck out of the house and been wandering all over town. This girl had gotten scared and uncomfortable, and my daughter basically told her, fine then, I'll go on without you. 

I immediately confiscated my daughter's phone and demanded the password. Upon looking through her phone, I find that sneaking out was the least of the concerns. She has nearly 1,000 FB friends, many of them older guys who consistently ask for ""special photos"". There were no nude photos, but some very suggestive selfies of her in a string bikini. There were hundreds of pictures of pot and pipes, movies of her and friends toking up, and several movies of what looked like a rave in an abandoned house. Apparently these things have happened right under my roof, or when she's staying overnight at a girlfriend's house (which has been fairly often, given school's still out for summer).

In conversations with her friends, she tells them that I don't give a shit about any of the stuff she does. In these same conversations she says that a lot of people have told her how beautiful she is, and she knows she could be famous easily. She only needs to get away from this shit-hole ... maybe move to Florida.

I am a stay-at-home mom. I talk with her frequently. She's always told me, ""mom, I'm not stupid enough to smoke pot at this age"". She's also told me she has no interest in being sexually active, but in conversations with friends claimed otherwise ... saying she's fucked &lt;name&gt; twice and would like to be ""bent over"" by several others.

I am WTF-ing so hard right now and I feel I've done everything wrong and that there's no way this kid can possibly get back to being an honest girl with personal goals that don't involve getting high, drunk, or laid.

I want to run away. I really do. Wash my hands of this. I hate my daughter right now, but I hate me even worse.

EDIT: And for the few finding fault with my use of the term ""skank"" ... I am getting this off my chest. Chill. I haven't used that sort of terminology with her or my other kids. She's my baby ... the last one ... and I love her more than you can imagine. She has so much potential. Creative, beautiful, and so friggin' kind to everyone she meets.

I remember the heavy snowflakes, they were being tossed upwards by the wind, making the jump from the bridge look like a decent into space. My hands were numb from the cold, I had no gloves, and I started taking off my jacket so I could make the climb over the railing. 

Then suddenly, a small light started approaching. A bicyclist was obviously determined to cross the bridge despite the weather. She was moving extremely slowly, for a bicyclist, but it was snowing after all. As I saw her coming closer, I saw a concerned and frightened look on her face. She had seen me, and I take it she knew that this particular bridge was common for jumpers. Somehow, I felt ashamed, I didn't want her to stop to consolidate me or feel the need to call for help. So I put my jacket back on, and kept walking in the same direction as bicycle-woman was going. She caught up with me asked quickly if I was OK, I kept walking, went home.

After that, everything happened so fast. I moved away, lived in an abandoned shop for a few months, somehow got a job sorting mail and handing out fruit-baskets in the office of an electrical company. My boss was a kind man, he made me feel important and needed. And I really felt I was doing something good when I saw how happy the employees of this company became when they got a basket of fruit. Suddenly, I had the money to rent a room of my own, and one of my flatmates was the sweetest guy ever. He pushed me into getting therapy and I got better. I'm not always OK, but I'm definitely better. Oh, and he proposed last summer. 

After a few years of odd jobs, a few setbacks, and even more therapy, I got a scholarship to go to uni. I started at 25 - a bit later than most, but ah, better late than never. I'm graduating next year. 

I went to this forum to post this because a song came on the radio today that reminded me of how awful I used to feel. When I was standing on that bridge, 19 years old, from a broken home, I thought no-one could ever love me. I'd been the bullied, skinny, awkward girl all my life. I had terrible OCD that kept me awake washing my hands and face all night, and that made me think everyone around me would be killed by my mere presence. I self-harmed in every thinkable way, had no job, nowhere to live, no friends, no family, no one. And I never thought I would have any of this either. 

When I sit back and look at my life now, it's not a dream life of any kind. I am a regular person, I don't have so much money but enough to buy some fresh fruit for breakfast, and enough so that me and my fiancÃ© can go out to eat sometimes. We have a little rental flat and a group of friends from work and uni that we meet sometimes for beer. And as soon as I'm a bit closer to finishing uni, we hope to start trying for a baby. 

Thank you, anonymous bicycle-woman, for all of this, for everything.

I love him so much. More than I ever thought I could love another human. He is handsome, smart, loving, funny...and difficult. He has been difficult since day one. I'm not a perfect parent (are any of us?) but I have tried so hard. When he had trouble managing his anger and frustration, I got him a therapist. He was diagnosed with ADHD at 7. ODD at 12. We all went to therapy as a family. He went on medication. A special class at school. Then a special school. More therapy. No matter what we did, the behavior got worse. Violent outbursts at school. Stealing. Sneaking out. Lying. Trouble with the law. Destroying things (tens of thousands of dollars of damage to my house). Nothing we did made a difference. But in the last year, I thought we were making some progress. It seems that he has just gotten better at hiding things. 

I have tried so hard to show him that I always love him. No matter what, I always made time for he and I to do things together. Told him I loved him. Told him that I knew he was struggling, but he was going to be fine and he would accomplish great things. Even when he was in trouble (and believe me, I am a strict disciplinarian, so he was often in trouble) I was very careful to never make it look like I was withholding my love and support. 

Today he stole from me. Again. He had left his facebook open on my computer, and I saw his posts, arranging to trade my belongings for drugs. A conversation with his grandfather revealed that he had done the same thing to him a few weeks ago. I'm done. I have other children too...The youngest is under 2 years old. I cannot allow their lives to be constant chaos because of the actions of their older brother. I will not be one of those parents who refuses to see what their child has become, and thus allows the situation to get worse. I am doing the right thing. And I have never felt worse about that. 

EDIT: Thank you all for your responses. Even those of you who strongly disagree with me. I called the police to make a CHINS petition (Child In Need of Supervision). It would have put him on probation, with the possibility for a group home placement, not juvie. Unfortunately, the cops said that the budget does not allow for a CHINS petition to go through at this point. I could file criminal charges against him, but the judge would just tell me that it was a parenting issue, and send him home. I am not trying to ruin his life, and I am not trying to ""get rid of him"". I just want some help for him, and I need to protect my younger kids from his bad choices. 

When confronted, my son told me that he wants to be a drug dealer because it's easy money, and that he doesn't see how any of this is a problem. I told him that he needed to either get off the drugs, go to some sort of outpatient CD treatment, see his therapist, and find a job, or ""there's the door"". He said ""IF I walk out, you will call and report me as a runaway."" ""Yep. Your choice."" He says my rules are bullshit, but he will do it. I am not feeling too hopeful about it at this time. He is scheduled for a CD assessment next week. Until then, he understands that I will be searching him, and his room. He lost his car months ago. The computer was in the family room; it's now been moved and password protected. His phone has been cancelled. It's not a great outcome, but it's not terrible either. I am fully aware that it's not over. His choices got him into this situation. In 6 months, he will turn 18, and he can choose what he's going to do from there.

I got in a taxi. This old lady, whom I am sort of familiar with, smiles as I hop in. She asks me how I'm going. ""Good thanks"" I reply robotically. She looked me in the eye before she started driving, and said ""Are you okay?"" She just knew something was wrong. ""Everything's fine, just been a rough week"" she asked me what happened and I gave her a very short version of my story. She replied with some of the best advice I could have heard about how it's only human to fail and we learn the best lessons from moments like that so we should cherish them.

I went silent, and she followed suite. We started getting closer to my house, and as I was looking out the window I started getting tears in my eyes. She leaned over, rubbed my shoulder, told me it's okay to let it out, and I just sobbed.

In all my years as an adult, I've never cried in front of another person until tonight.

I gave her $50 for my $10 ride home, told her to keep the change, and walked inside and cried some more. I feel infinitely better now, and almost as though that needed to happen for me to move on.

My family and I have all been neatly dressed and we've at least tried our best to speak the languages when we can. We aren't cutting right in front of people or littering or acting like jackasses and I haven't seen anyone who looks American (we're all obviously easy to spot) being rude.

If youre at a museum... don't fucking rub your hands on the glass! If you see a family clearly posing for a nice picture, how about you wait the fucking two seconds or walk around. If you're on top of the effile (sp) tower where its packed with tourists including kids, don't fucking smoke.

Today I brought him to the museum, when we where there we stopped for lunch at the restaurant. after going tho the whole menu with him he picked out a grill cheese and when the waiter brought his food, he became angry because well he dident want a grill cheese anymore. Sometimes kids can be picky and angry when they are hungry and i understand that. He asked me if he could have my hamburger instead, which i said yes to, under the condition that he actually eat it. I switched our plates and put the hamburger he ASKED for in front of him. Out of nowhere he starts screaming at the top of his lungs, and flips the plate over onto the floor. My mother is with us and is stareing at me in wide mouthed shock, so is every single other person there. I quickly grab my sons hand and take him out of the dining room and into the bathroom. I ask in a stern voice what is the matter, and he responds back, well screams at me that daddy loves him more and so on and so forth a bunch of nonsense , gettting louder each time. i take him into the stall and try in a stern voice to explain to him that it is not acceptable to behave like this or to do what he just did, and he just screams louder and starts forcing himself to cough inbetween screams, (he has learned how to force himself to throw up) now i have had it. Hes thrown fits before but never this bad or in public like this as the secounds tick by hes getting more and more hysterical. He will not give me any sort of reason for why he is freaking out. So I turn him around and firmly swat him across the backside twice. He stops screaming and I say in a stern voice. 
Stop it. We are going to sit down now. if you keep screaming we are going home, and you are going to bed. 
he stops crying and his face is all red and puffy, I lead him out of the stall and to the sink, I'm wiping off his face with a paper towel
 When this absoultly officious bitch intones from one of the stalls 

""Could you keep it down and stop beating your child in public? God, what kind of a bad parent are you? i feel like i should call someone...""

To which I walk out of the bathroom. I really wanted to scream something about minding your own fucking beeswax or something along those lines, but I refuse to lower myself to the standards of morons in front of my son. I am not going to let someone who is taking a shit criticize my fucking parenting. Giving discipline is part of being a parent. You are in charge of this little person for the first half of their life, and its your job to teach them how to fucking behave. What and how you teach them molds them into the person they will be for the second part of their life. Reason, Love and Logic are wonderful and important things to use when parenting. but seriously- sometimes a kid needs a smack on the ass. I am not going to allow my child to be a shit crazy animal in a restaurant that other people paid hard earned money to eat in. If a smack on the ass is what it takes to get the message home well, fuck, as a last resort. thats what I'm going to do. I DO NOT advocate beating your children, or physically harming children in anyway. I love my child, he's the fucking light of my life- that's why i was so bothered by this lady. I am trying my fucking damnnest to do right by this little person every single day, and sometimes i have to do things i don't want to do, to help him understand that is and is not acceptable.

One year ago tonight at 9 PM, we were coming back from your brother's birthday party. You and I, together again after months of separation. I told you we should have gone to the same college, but *no*. You just *had* to get away and go off to be successful. I still loved you, because you were my best friend. 

But one year ago, we had the best time. It was like we were little kids again. I grew up with you for 17 fucking years. I had no siblings, so you were like my sister, and I your brother. You were part of the family. 

As we rounded the curb, I made a joke about how we have to ""see each other more often, before we get old and die."" You laughed, just as a drunk driver slammed into your side of the car. 

I saw your body ripped in half -- something that I will never be able to unsee. Blood has a smell; very strong, and I didn't know that. But at that moment, I did. 

As our car flipped, I heard myself screaming out your name. I remembered the first summer I met you: I had just moved to the neighborhood and I was riding my bike past your house, and you threw a water balloon at me. Best friends ever since. 

The car came to a stop at the bottom of a hill. The drunk driver left. It was a hit and run. Even though your body was ripped in half; your intestines were in your lap, your left eye was out of its socket -- I tried to keep you together. Literally holding you together. 

But you were gone. One year later, and I still can't drive in a car. I can't think of you without wanting to throw up. I can't think. I'm still numb. 

But today's the day, and I'm tired of everyone tip-toeing around your death. It happened. You fucking *died*. It was awful. Absolutely awful, and it fucked me up in ways I'm never going to get over. The therapists all say the same fucking thing: it takes time. And maybe it does, but I miss you. 

I'm so sorry I couldn't help you. I wish it would have been me.

I'll enjoy the drive on 17 South Bound, but of course with the traffic it'll take a while, but I can listen to some Jerry Reed or other light music off the iPod in my T-bird.

I can put food on my table, wear clean clothes, and keep myself clean.  I sleep in a clean bed, even if alone, and usually curl up with my tablet to read a book or catch up on Adventure Time.

So ya know what? Despite everything bad that's going on in the world outside my peripheral vision, in my world, that I see every day?

I usually tip 15-20% whenever I eat out and unless some major gripes with the service, I just go with it.

But some servers need to realize that the tip is gratuity for a service they provide.  And if no service is provided, no tip is fucking required; and they don't seem to understand it's completely voluntary, even though it's a social custom/norm... it's NOT required.

I was eating out with a couple friends at lunch today and it took them 10 minutes just to come get our orders.  15-20 minutes later, they still didn't bring out appetizers or water or anything.  when asked, they said it'll be here shortly.

Another 15 minutes pass, still nothing.  We can't just run somewhere else now since we have ~25 minutes until we have to get back to the office.  Finally, they brought food for 2 of the 4 of us, and both orders were WRONG.  We figured, screw it, the food didn't look half bad, and we had to run soon, so whatever.  and not once during the entire hour was our water refilled.  another 5-10 minutes pass and still no food for the rest of the party.  Finally, with so much attitude, they told us they were having a busy day (what? the restaurant was barely 80% full), and offered us the food that was sitting at the next table.  The patrons at the next table had gotten fed up and left and the food was sitting there for 10 minutes.  Seriously?  You're going to offer food that was sitting at another table to us?

Finally we just said forget it, we finished our food and my other two friends were just going to grab something quick on the way back to the office.

The bill was $35 and we paid *exactly* that.  No tips because of how shitty the service was.  And we proceeded to leave.

The waiter ran up to me -- funny how inattentive he was during our entire meal, but noticed immediately how there was no tip paid within moments of us getting up off our seats -- and told me I had forgotten to tip him.  I told him a tip is a gratuity paid to the good services rendered, service we did not receive.  He got really angry and started saying how I had to pay for it, blablabla and I told him to fuck off.

Fuck these types of places and people.

^(*EDIT: for clarity, some people think that I'm a saint and didn't say anything for the entire duration.  I did complain about the wait several times, only to be received by what I mentioned in the post about being busy, etc..  I also let them know they got our orders wrong, but we would take it anyway.  And since some people seem quick to put the blame on the kitchen, he showed us the orders he put in and he DID take them down wrong.*)",,False,,t5_2ranw,1376424739.0,,,True,t3_1k9kwi,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1k9kwi/tipping_is_voluntary_not_required/,

Made plans starting on Monday, different options with different people, general plan of attack, lots of enthusiasm from four ""friends.""

Now that the big day is here, I waited after class for my friend for lunch, she never showed up or answered her phone. I went home and cleaned, thinking I'd have people over. 

During that time I was sending texts and calling, but got no answer between my four closest friends.

It got to be mid afternoon, so I just went to see a movie by myself. I tried to make dinner plans afterward, but the only person who did answer, who had said they were for sure doing dinner tonight, said they decided to eat with someone else.

So I took myself out to eat and waited around in the parking lot after to see if anyone would like to catch another movie, or have some drinks or cake or something. Sat there for a while, finally got a bite, that person said they'd shower and be over to the theater an hour early for snacks.

I drove to the theater and waited in the parking lot two hours, then came back home. I sent about 6 texts and called twice during those two hours to that friend that was supposed to meet me. No answer. But now they finally answer that I'm back home, saying they forgot and forgot to look at their phone.

At least I have friends on the internet, I guess. Worst birthday ever.

Or at least, I don't know if I am yet. I found out about an hour ago. Everything is still numb.

I've known since I met her, 5 1/2 years ago, that she struggled with serious depression. She tried several times in the past to kill herself. This time, she succeeded.

If you'll lend your screens, I'd like to tell you about her.

She was 28 or 29. She learned to cover her Southern accent because apparently Minnesotans judge southerners rather harshly. She had a really beautiful smile, she listened. She listened more than she should have. She was smart, but didn't believe it. She used to never swear, then the more she went to therapy, the more she swore. She loved so very deeply, even strangers. She volunteered, gave of herself at all times. I wish she hadn't given so deeply of herself, she deserved some of the wonderfulness of her.

She was incredibly kind. She loved the Ninja Turtles, Star Trek, and Firefly. She rewrote the Firefly theme song into a Christian worship song and, despite being an atheist, I thought it was absolutely wonderful. She wrote Star Trek Christian fanfiction. She would sing ""Therapy Time Down By The Bay"" with me ad nauseum. Listing these things makes me feel like she was special needs, or something, but really, she was so very herself that she just enjoyed whatever she goddamn well pleased and made no apologies.

She was a terrible cook. One time, she made broccoli-cheese soup, but substituted hummus for cheese to make it vegan, and substituted kale and peas for broccoli. Then burned the mixture.We agreed that boobs were awesome, and we'd both make a point to squeeze ours in front of each other when we were sure no boys were looking.

She was so good with children. Her two cousins, 3 and 2, in the house she lived in, loved her incredibly. She knew exactly how to deal with any kids.

She traveled rather extensively. She let me share her room when my own house was too far from school to commute with my rigorous schedule for a few weeks.

She was the best kind of Christian. She dearly loved everyone. She did SO much work with the homeless, the addicts, the down-and-out. She loved. She loved. She loved and loved and loved the world, but she didn't love herself anywhere as much as she should have. She was beautiful. She wore skirts over pants and looked ridiculous but rocked that shit out. She spoke Klingon. Despite her religious beliefs, she laughed and loved me when I told her about sending a picture of my boobs to a guy. She laughed and loved me all the time, and I loved her and I still love her. 

Sweet, sweet friend, I hope you're at peace now. I'm sorry things were so hard for you. I wish you had stuck around. I love you.

I'm so fucking pissed. Fuck shit damn ass bitch cunt wtf.
Apparently I'm a ""sell out"" and a ""bad friend"" because I won't lie for my 'best friend' about a guy raping her. 

Backstory;
Me and my friend were hanging out with these two guys. 
I knew from the get go that these guys were trouble, and I really didn't even want to hang out with them, but whatever.
So we're at (we'll call him Todd)'s house. His friends (fake) name is Mike. 
Todd brings out some liquor and we all start drinking.

(Now before I go any further, you should know that my friend was NOT that drunk.
I am completely aware of the fact that there is a point when a girl has drank too much and it IS rape if a guy has sex/does sexual things with her. This was not the case.
She had a few shots, and while she was buzzed, she was still capable of speaking properly, walking, and rationally thinking.)

This is when things start to take a turn for the worse...
My friend decides to suck Todds dick in front of everyone. (mfw..) She did not protest to doing it, she just stuck her head down there and went to work.
She even went as far to swallow, and after she did, she popped her head up and said, ""It didn't taste bad!""

Okay. That was fucking weird, but whatever, I thought it was over.
I was fucking wrong.

She then decides to strut over to Mike and start making out with him and give him a handjob. He was taking off her pants, they were all over eachother, lots of touching and kissing, etc.
They didn't actually have sex, but they were pretty damn close to it.

Five minutes later, what do you know? She's sucking Todds dick AGAIN. 
(By the way, she hadn't consumed anymore alcohol at this point, so no she wasn't that drunk.)

A lot happened that night but that bit was the only piece you need to hear, so let's cut to the next day.

Me: ""I cannot believe what you did last night!"" 
Her: ""Oh my gosh I know! It was so funny!""
Me: *jokingly* ""You sucked Todds dick in front of everybody! WITH NO SHAME TOO!""
Her: *laughing* ""I swear I looked around and didn't see anybody!""
Me: *laughing* ""Cmon now don't lie!"" 
Her: *laughing* ""Well it didn't taste bad!""

I can honestly say that me and her joked about what she did for a two full weeks after it happened.
She thought the whole thing was HILARIOUS.
She said she didn't care about what happened, and that as long as they don't tell anybody, that she's fine with it.

So up until this point, I didn't really think much of it. 
She had a crazy night and did some dumb shit, but we all make mistakes, and she seemed okay with it so all was well.
That is until about two and half (maybe three) weeks after the whole ordeal.
I had just walked through the door to my house when my phone started ringing.
And as you may have guessed, it was my friend.

Her: ""You need to come over right now. I told my mom and aunt about what happened and we're going to the police.""
Me: ""What the fuck are you talking about?""
Her: ""I told them about me and Todd and they want to press charges.""
Me: ""What do you mean? Why would they press charges?""
*Her mom takes the phone.*
HM: ""He's not going to get away with raping her. We need you to tell the cops what happened.""
Me: ""What? He didn't rape her, what are you guys talking about?""
*Friend takes the phone.*
Her: ""He forced me to suck his dick. I was so drunk and he forcefully made me do it.""
Me: ""What about Mike? He did that stuff with you after you sucked Todds dick. If you were too drunk for the Todd thing, then that would make you too drunk for the Mike thing, so shouldn't you tell on him too?""
Her: ""No, the Mike thing was different. I knew what I was doing with him.""
(That makes no fucking sense...)
Me: ""But Todd didn't force you to do anything. I was there the whole time, it all happened right in front of me?""
*Her mom takes the phone.*
HM: I need you to tell us the complete truth about what happened that night.

Long story short, I told them everything that happened.
I even told them about how she was laughing and joking about it, and how the day after it happened she WENT TO HANG OUT WITH TODD. (If Todd supposably raped her then why the hell would she want to hang out with him afterwards?)

After telling them the truth about what happened they decided not to go to the cops.

I was kind of mad at the fact that she was lying to her family just to get attention, but nonetheless she was my best friend and I cared about her.
I thought that would be the end of everything, but I was wrong once again.

She tells me a few weeks later, ""We can't hang out anymore. My mom and aunt say you sold me out and you're a bad friend.""
Me: ""What the fuck? How the fuck am I a bad friend? We've been best friends for years and I've ALWAYS had your back, but I couldn't let someone go to jail over something they didn't do. All I did was tell the truth.""
Her: ""Yeah but you didn't have to tell my mom about how I was joking about it.""
Me: ""If I wouldn't have told her then she would've gone to the cops and ruined that boys life. That's fucked up.""

Me and her went back and forth for a little bit, but basically her and her family think I'm the fucking spawn of Satan for not having her back.

WHAT THE FUCK. FUCK YOU GUYS. 
YOUR FUCKING DAUGHTER WAS ABOUT TO RUIN SOME KIDS LIFE OVER SOMETHING THAT HE DIDN'T FUCKING DO.
I WAS NOT ABOUT TO BE APART OF PUTTING SOMEONE IN JAIL IF THEY DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING DO ANYTHING WRONG.
YOU GUYS ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE FOR THINKING IT'S OKAY TO THROW AROUND FALSE RAPE CLAIMS.
YOU THINK I'M A BAD PERSON FOR TELLING THE FUCKING TRUTH, BUT YOUR DAUGHTER IS A FUCKING ANGEL DESPITE HER LYING ABOUT GETTING RAPED?
NO FUCK THAT.
RAPE ISN'T A WORD TO USE LIGHTLY. THAT'S SOME SERIOUS SHIT THAT FUCKS PEOPLES LIVES UP.
HE COULD HAVE WENT TO JAIL FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG, AND WOULD'VE BEEN PUT ON THE SEX OFFENDERS LIST FOR THE REST OF HIS FUCKING LIFE.
I'M A BAD PERSON FOR NOT BEING OKAY WITH THAT? 
I'VE HAD YOUR BACK THROUGH EVERYTHING, BUT THE ONE TIME YOU PUT ME IN A SHITTY ASS SITUATION WHERE I HAD NO FUCKING CHOICE BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH, I'M A SELLOUT.
YOU GUYS SHOULD FEEL FUCKING ASHAMED.
I LOST MY BEST FRIEND OVER THIS RETARDED ASS SHIT. IT FUCKING SUCKS, BUT SHIT, I'M PROBABLY BETTER WITHOUT HER.

I'm so FUCKING mad.
I understand that she regrets what she did. If she would've just came to me and been like, ""I really regret what happened. I've been feeling so ashamed lately and I wish I could take it back,"" then I would've helped her through it.
But she NEVER told me that he forced her to do it, or even that she regretted it, until the night she cried rape.

But no! I'm the fucking devil because I wasn't okay with falsely accusing somebody of rape!

I know what it's like to do something and regret it afterwards, but I would NEVER fucking accuse the guy of raping me unless he actually did.
I fucking HATE girls like that.
You were completely fine with doing it when it was actually happening, but now that it's after the fact and you're starting to regret it, you try and find an excuse so you don't have to feel guilty about what you did.

GROW THE FUCK UP AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS.
YOU WERE ALL FOR DOING WHAT YOU DID THAT NIGHT, BUT NOW THAT REALITY IS HITTING AND YOU REALIZED YOU MADE A MISTAKE, YOU WANT TO TRY AND PLAY THE ROLE OF A VICTIM SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO OWN UP TO THE CHOICES YOU MADE.

(parents were out of town have the house to ourselves) I asked my best friend (who I ALWAYS mommy for every single time we go out without exception) if she would take care of me this once and not get so drunk she said of course. 

Me and my best friend get to my house and we are taking shots 
waiting for the other friend to get there. An hour or so later (I'm pretty buzzed at this point) my other friend shows up with 2 guys. Did she call and say she was bringing people? No. Did she even ask if it was ok? No. Oh and who does she bring? The guy she is talking to and the guy my other friend has an NSA type relationship with. 

Whatever I think I am pretty drunk and we are all sitting in my room drinking chilling when the first two get up to go smoke on the patio. Ok fine whatever. Then my best friend has to ""pee"" and of course she can't pee alone so he goes with her. So here I am alone, in my room, drunk, on my birthday. So I just start crying. For a good 45 minutes I just cry and I look at the clock it's 3am at this point. I go to find them to tell them time to go when what do I see everyone sitting together having a grand old time. No one thought to come get me or see if I'm ok or anything. Oh and look my ""best"" friend is belligerent drunk. 

I send everyone home and my ""best"" friend was planning on sleeping over anyway so now its just us two and she gets like all super drunk girls get, drunk sick. So 4am and I am cleaning puke, cigarette butts, empty glasses ect while she is passed out. 

Real special birthday for me. I mean I know she is an attention whore and 9/10 I don't mind because I'm not the type that likes attention, but just once I wanted the day to be about me. Just once.  

**Edit:** thanks everyone for listening! I know I should talk to her and tell her how it made me feel but I'm scared of losing her. I don't have very many friends and I guess I feel like having friends like this is better than being alone.  Stupid I know. Also every time I have tried to talk to her about how something makes me feel or anything basically not about her and about me she has a way of spinning things and in the end I feel so stupid for even bringing it up. But I am going to try again. Wish me luck! 

**Edit 2:** Talked to her this morning and she basically said that I was making a big deal out of nothing because it was a Monday night what else were we going to do? She offered to take me out this weekend, but I would have to drive because she doesn't have a car. I told her forget it and I haven't talked to her since. (It's been about an hour) The hard part of this is we both work at the same mall. Will update as time passes. 

**Edit 3:** She just texted me saying let's go to Hollywood tonight I'll find someone to drive us so you can have fun. I told her I don't feel like going to Hollywood. I didn't go see her at lunch today (I usually take her lunch since we work very close to each other) but she hasn't come to see me so I dono. I am not sure if she feels bad or she is just trying to play catch-up. 

I randomly texted an old friend who was actually the first person to wish me a happy birthday and told him I was feeling down/about the situation and he said that he insisted we go have fun. I wasn't expecting it at all but who knows!

Honey, you have no idea. You have no idea that I was visiting on leave. You have no idea because you wanted to hold conversations about the latest movies and tv shows and fashion. I don't know a thing about that. He does. 

But I'm a bit out of date. I've been a bit busy this last year. Heck.. the last eight. I've lived in six countries. Fought in two wars. I learned two foreign languages to boot. And tourist level for the countries I fought in too. Enough to know the important polite things. And the work related ones like ""Where did he go?"" ""How many"" and ""Get down or I will shoot you.""

And when I've had free time, sorry, I haven't spent it watching your precious latest episode of Lost or whatever the hell is on these days. I write in my free time. And I'm very good at it. Heck, I've done a bit of poetry too. When I'm in the states, I volunteer my time with whatever local shelter or charity could use a carpenter or electrician or plumber. I do all three. He can't even patch a punctured tire. I know because I patched his before we came to the bar.

And when he wowed you with his masters degree and his talk of considering philosophy a bit of a hobby.. I let you go. I don't have a degree. Don't need one. I can recite Niccolo Machiavelli and Robert Greene. I can debate the relative merits of political systems in practice and on paper. I can tell you all about the -real- American history. The fascinating things that make our American past into something plausible.. something believable. Stories that make our founding fathers back into real people. Back into men. Men you can laugh at and with. And admire all the more for seeing behind the myth.

I explain why a car's engine works and how an aerofoil keeps a plane aloft. I can talk about art history and the Melancholic Sublime movement. I'm a senior member of two art museums donating every year and attending events when I can, every two years or so.

And you picked a lying, fat sack of crap of a boy over me. And had the gall to call me boring. 

Maybe.. just maybe I'm not.

Maybe you are. Maybe if you had a thing worth talking about coming out of those pretty painted lips of yours you would have had a fascinating night.

I don't remember much of it, just the bits and pieces that come at me during the night. I have 3 older sisters that have said they remember incidents as young as 8 months old. My last memory is at age 10 right before the abuse surfaced. I never told anyone about this until around age 17, but my sisters told my parents at that time. 

Fast forward to age 17, I had found a bank statement from my dad that proved my suspicions of my grandfather making monthly payments to us. I come from a pretty wealthy background, where most of our world revolves around money. I knew that there were talks of a court case and whatnot, but my parents thought it would be ""too much to put us through"". I later found out that my mom had no idea of these payments. 

Around the same time, my best friend was killed by a car walking down the street to get to my house. I couldn't handle all of this and walked right into a pretty abusive relationship that centered around a mutual love of cocaine. I spent thousands of dollars of my father's money because I knew he couldn't say anything. One night, I got really messed up and was raped at a party by a stranger. I came back to my boyfriend's house and he viewed this as ""cheating"" and went off on me. He spent hours raping and burning me. At one point he poured listerine on my wounds. This was the last time I ever did cocaine. It was the worst 13 hours of my entire life. 

The next morning, I woke up basically in the grave I was digging for myself. My dad was bulimic, my mom an alcoholic, and my sisters had their own addictions. I felt like I couldn't come clean to anyone about what was going on in my life. A few days later, New Year's Eve 2009, I was on the verge of suicide, and I found an opportunity later that day.

 I was driving down an icy road and a [presumably drunk] driver drove me off the road. I remember driving through the woods basically and thinking ""this is it"". Instead of braking, I floored it. I attempted to take my seatbelt off but it was too quick of a moment and was unable to. I had flipped my SUV 3 times and landed in the middle of woods on the side of my car, about .4 miles away from the roadway. 

I was awoken by a young guy, maybe mid 20's. He wasn't even sure how he found me, he saw some lights and became suspicious. This guy held my hand for an hour until the police/ems/etc could reach me and cut me out of the car. It turns out I was in those woods knocked out for over an hour. (Estimated by a phone call my friend made before the crash and I told her I was on that road.) Anyways, I don't remember what I told this guy but I remember he kept repeating things like ""this is your second chance"". The weird thing is that this guy probably saved my life, and I have absolutely no record of him-- from police reports, witness statements, etc. no one could find him.  

When I got out of the hospital the next day, I realized this guy was right.  I was lucky enough to have financial support, an education, and even luckier in that my boyfriend had never been at my house. He lived about 30 minutes away. Within a week I changed my number , found a therapist, and went to an NA meeting. (I didn't end up following through with NA because I was able to stop the coke use with a therapist.)

I am now at a great school about 6 hours away from my hometown, which I think is best for me. My ex-boyfriend died of a heroine overdose just over a year ago. I ended up having to get neurosurgery 2 months ago for a shunt due to complications from the car accident. I've had a few healthy relationships and I am working with the best counselor I've ever had in my life. I've always  struggled with night terrors because of the abuse. I have done some EMDR therapy, and with the help of all of these great things in my life, I slept for 9 straight hours last night! I'm cool with answering questions but I just needed to tell this to someone.

I'm sick and tired of being ostracized by my own race just because I have different interests. So what if I like to play video games? So fucking what if I listen to anime and video game OSTs while I study? So what if I dress in campus sweaters, jeans and running shoes? So what if I have daft punk posters on my wall?
How does that make me any different and someone to look down upon?
What makes me any less of a black person?
It's gotten to the point that I hide my interests around people. I don't let people look at my YouTube account. I don't let people go through my I-pod. I don't like people going into my room. I'm too afraid of the weird looks I might get. I love what I love but the way I'm treated makes me feel like I should be ashamed.

My roommate is an exchange student from the Caribbean and I felt relieved when I met her. Finally, someone who doesn't judge me because I don't conform to the stereotypes. 
Recently, she's been taking jabs at me. When we're on the school shuttle bus, I joke around with the bus driver until we get off at the campus parking lot. My roommate gives me a weird look and laughs. 
I ask her, ""what?""
She says, ""just making sure you're still black.""
What the fuck does that even mean? What does that have to do with being black? I'm being friendly to a person and suddenly I'm not black?
What makes being friendly and non-confrontational ""not black""? How is speaking English correctly (or how they say it, ""talking proper"") a non-black thing? 
It's infuriating to see black people who love to jump the gun and call every little thing ""racism"" but then they go about judging other people of their own race because they don't conform to stereotypes. 
We complain about the stereotypes that are attributed to us but then when someone is different, apparently it's considered a bad thing?
I'm tired of being called ""white"" because I don't fit the description of a ""typical black person"". Even my non-black friends say I'm ""white-washed"" or ""asian-washed"", or ""It's like you're not even black Accumulus!""
I'm tired of feeling like it's a wrong thing that I'm so indifferent to race. I really don't care how much melanin you have in your skin, it doesn't tell me anything about who you are as a person.
I am black. My skin is dark, and I'm from Africa. That's all there really is to it. Nothing more, nothing less.

In short: I'm a 31 year old who made my dream of living on a Sea Ray 470 sundancer come true. I worked my ass off and got it. That boat and my car are basically my only two possessions. My cousin who I used to be close with but drifted apart from got into a motorcycle crash (without insurance, fucking moron) and racked up about $150k in medical debt. 

Since I'm perceived to be rich by my cousin's family and my Mom, they wanted me to sell my boat to pay for my cousin's medical bills. I told them no, I won't be doing that. They got extremely angry, threatened me, and my Mom/cousin's family/cousin disowned me. I've been recording the phone calls and collecting the texts just in case I need to defend myself in any legal way. 

I'd only ever sell this boat to help out my brother or my Dad if they were in a bad place. 

I'm just wondering from an outside perspective if what I'm doing seems like the right choice. I don't feel like giving up almost 12 years of work to pay off my cousin's medical debt. My Dad took my side and told my Mom/cousin's family to fuck off, it's not my fault and not my responsibility.

This is simply an update of how I used what everyone told me on here especially u/ya_tu_sabes so here is what happen last night and this morning.

**Update** For any of you still reading this thread last night the old friend I texted came to my work to take me out. Where I work there is a bar within walking distance so we just went there. My ""best"" friend called me up because she was off work and needed a ride home. I told her I'm at the bar with ""Jon"" who she also knows (better than me even) she said eww why and I told her because he made an effort to make me happy on my birthday, and promptly hung up. A few minutes later guess who shows up at the bar? Yup you got it! She does. Meanwhile, Jon has been feeding me shots, has let the bartenders know the situation and they are just pumping it out so I am very drunk at this point. In comes ""best"" friend. 

Her: Are you drunk? 

Me: Yupppppp

Her: Who's going to take me home?

Jon: She's gonna have a good time tonight if you want to join in on that you can if you don't then go home.

Me: Wheeee (I'm drunk) 

She ends up staying and texting on her phone the whole time until Jon and I decide to go have hookah she wants to come too. (She doesn't drive pretty sure she is using us for a ride but I am to drunk to care) 
Get to the hookah lounge and again she is on her phone but I just don't care. Then Jon gets up to go to the bathroom. Here she takes her shot. 

Her: I can't believe you're hanging out with Jon. He is so annoying. You know I don't like him. 

Me: (I've sobered up a bit but just intoxicated enough to not let fear get the best of me) Well this isn't your night. I like hanging out with him, in fact he was the first person to wish me a happy birthday, he took me out so I am hanging out with him you don't have to be here. 

Her: *blank stare* 

Me: When he found out I'm upset he came to cheer me up which is more then you've done. 

Her: I always do stuff for you. 

Me: Like what? 

Her: well it's not like you do anything for me! 

Me: Really? What about all the times I've gone out of my way to take you to and from work? All the times that I've sat there listening to you and comforting you when you cried? What about the fact that I bring you lunch every day? Or the time I took you to the hospital and *I* paid for it? All the times I have taken you out to make *you* happy. I'm sorry this is my night and if you are not going to make an effort I don't want you here. 

She gets up to go to the bathroom. I honestly can't believe that I told her all of that I felt so relieved to get it off my chest (haha). She ended up having some guy she knows take her home while me and Jon stayed out until 3-4 in the morning having a blast! At then end of the night he told me ""You're my sister and I am so sorry that you were hurt. If I had known that had happened on your birthday I would have been there in a heartbeat."" 

Now fast forward to this morning. She comes to my work (she never visits me I always visit her) and says that I was right last night. She apologized and said that she should have been focused on me and that she doesn't want to lose me as a friend. I simply told her that actions speak louder than words. 

She's off to work so we'll see what happens I guess! 

I can't thank all of you enough for seriously giving me the cahones to stand up for myself. You all made me come to the conclusion that it would be alright if I was alone for a while which gave me the courage to **finally** speak my mind and tell her how I feel instead of internalizing it. 

Edit for clarity: Jon is ""like a brother"" not my actual brother. When we go anywhere we have always been brother/sister because we look so much alike. Also Jon is not his real name. :)

Lady comes in with her niece and says that the camera they just purchased a few hours ago didn't have a lens cap. Honestly I think they just fucking lost it somehow and they never noticed but whatever, no big deal I can get you a new lens cap. So I research what size of a lens cap is needed for her camera, figure it out, and give it to her. Whatever, it's a 75 cent piece of plastic, no big deal. But then the lady decides she wants to bitch about how ""Oh no it's not the Nikon lens cap. It wouldn't be fair to my niece if she didn't get the Nikon lens cap."" Are you FUCKING serious? Because the cap doesn't have the word ""Nikon"" on it, it's a bad cap and nowhere near good enough for you? GIVE ME A SILVER SHARPIE AND I'LL WRITE IT ON FOR YOU. 

It wouldn't have been so bad had she not acted so self-righteous and holier than thou. What a d-bag.

Then she says that she wants to straight up return the camera (which they had already used for a few hours by this point, by the way) and exchange it for a brand new one so they can get the fucking Nikon lens cap. Really lady? IT'S A FUCKING LENS CAP. It wouldn't be FAIR to your niece if she didn't get it?? You know what else isn't fucking fair? LIFE. And you want the god damn lens cap so fucking bad you'd return it just so you can get a 75 cent piece of plastic with the fucking word Nikon on it?? When I was handing you a perfectly fine one for FREE?!

I was incredulous. I had to ask twice just to make sure I understood the situation.
""You want to return the camera... for the lens cap?"" 
""Yes.""
""For...... the lens cap that says Nikon...?""
""Yes. Can't you do that?""

Holy fuck. So I get a manager and he tells me to just grab one from a brand new camera give it to them, then label the camera with the missing lens cap as an opened item. So we're losing $50+ on an otherwise perfectly fine, unused camera. All because some bitch wanted the ""right"" lens cap because the one without the word Nikon just wasn't good enough. Yeah, you're so fucking special aren't you? So we'll bend over backwards just so you can get some silver colored lettering on a piece of plastic. ""The customer is always right!"" Oh yeah sure. The customer can be a complete douchecanoe, but they're always right! 

And as if that's not enough, as I'm getting her precious Nikon lens cap she says to me: ""Sorry about this, but I'm a business major."" What the FUCK does that mean? I ate a burger for lunch yesterday. WHO THE FUCK CARES? How is that fucking relevant to this situation?! That somehow makes you better? ""Oh I'm a business major so anything less than a 75 cent piece of plastic with the word Nikon on it is not good enough for my niece"". Get the fuck out of here. It's a piece of fucking plastic.

Oh yeah, then she somehow gets it in her head that I stole her niece's memory card. No I fucking didn't. What the fuck even made you think this? 

Oh and thanks for calling the store afterwards to complain about how you thought that I was accusing you of lying. No, I fully believe that she thought there was no lens cap. But I'd bet my next paycheck it fell somewhere after you opened the box and never fucking noticed. 

What a obnoxious bitch.

**Edit**: I just woke up and didn't expect so many comments. I forgot to mention that the niece was the one that paid for the camera and was content with the off brand lens cap. I didn't have any issues with her. It was the Aunt that was annoying. At one point she (the Aunt) also complained to me about why they didn't get a lower price on the camera since it was a little cheaper online. I told her if she went to customer service they could process a refund for the difference but she wanted to know why they didn't do it when she was first rung up. Thing is, she didn't even purchase it from us. She bought it from a different location. How am I to know why they didn't give her an online price?

Anyway after sleeping I feel much more.. placid I suppose. After the incident yesterday I actually cooled off for a while, but was reminded of it when my manager pulled me to talk about the phone call after we closed. I said this in a comment but I'll say it here too; I'd say about 95% of the customers I interact with are at least okay interactions. And sometimes they're really great ones. But every now and then there always seems to be one that makes me rage. 

Anyway, my rant is over, just had to get it off my chest last night. Whether you agreed with me or not, thanks for reading guys. I'll be sure to read the rest of the comments later.

**Edit 2**: I'm glad everyone is getting a kick out of 'douchecanoe'! Haha. I've honestly cooled off since then. It still kind of annoys me but I kind of understand where she's coming from, even if she was being really obnoxious.

She looked at me so sheepishly and stated clearly that she would not do that.  He began to become super agitated and demanded it, accusing her of causing him extreme anxiety.  She calmly said, ""you have to work through that, but I won't do what you are demanding"".   This went on for several minutes until he settled down and went back to the fountain.  She seemed so embarrassed, stepped away for a bit.

I did not get a chance to tell her that I used to struggle with OCD at that level.  My parents always preferred not to make a scene, even at home.  They always enabled my demands and resultantly I had a real painful struggle when I went out on my own.  I would have been saved so much misery if someone had helped me identify the issue and work with it when I was so young.  

Sure it wasn't a pleasant 2-3 minutes at the park.  But she did what was right for her kid and I am so happy for him.  Don't feel bad for doing what your kid needs. You rock.

One night I went out with a few mates to celebrate his birthday. Now I live a town with a limited amount of local hotspots. Everyone usually goes to the same place, but tonight we decided to go to a quieter bistro/bar. We all arrive around 8pm and have a few drinks waiting for everyone else to arrive.

That's when I spot my girlfriend of 4 years sitting in the bistro with another man. I knew something was up as she said she was staying home tonight (we live together). I'm a very calm man, even when confronted with situations such as this. So I just watched them, and texted her asking how he night was going. Getting a reply of ""just watching a movie"".

After about 2 hours they leave in a taxi, fondling each other. I knew she would be going back to his place because I said I was going to crash at a friends place. All my mates had seen this, so I gathered them up with a plan.

We all went back to my place (we had not drank much at all so there were at least 10 sober enough to drive with 8 more able to tag along). Now the lease was in her name so what I was about to do next makes it that much easier. 

We got all my stuff TV, bed, coffee table, dining table, microwave. Nearly everything that was useful was mine except for a few kitchen appliances and utensils. Loaded everything up in all the boys cars and left taking it back to a friends place with a spare room. Basically I just left without a reason or trace. Also changed my number and email.

A few weeks later I found out through some friends that she still has no idea what happened and was emotionally destroyed. I didn't care at all. Once someone cheats on me they are automatically dead to me, no emotion is felt to them at all any more. Then a few months later she found out that I knew she was cheating which resulted in her showing up my place of work asking questions. I told security to let her in and then acted like it was the first time I had met her. A very satisfying moment in me life.

Now you may be asking about if I considered if she would become depressed and commit suicide. I knew she wouldn't I had known her for way too long, she valued her life way too much and was too self absorbed. I don't know what happened after that.

And so much other creepy shit.  I am so different from everyone else my siblings.  It's been sad for me and scary.  My parents are both dead.  My dad last year and my mother the year before.  So I think I probably knew before, but now I""m just getting to where I can face it.  By the way, I'm 51 years old.  I feel like I should have known earlier, but how could I?  I'm just now able to put the pieces together - my dad dad daddy that I grew up with tried to tell me the whole story one time but he walked it back because (I guess) he knew I loved him so much I couldn't bear if he wasn't my biological father.

I would be going on for giant wall of text if I explained all the pieces of my family life I FINALLY PUT TOGETHER.  And how it all makes sense now!  I have known for many years that my parents had to get married ""because of me.""  But my dad told me the whole story, as much as he could make himself, about 10 years ago now.  The story would be too long about how I know that my mom was raped by her father, my grandpa, and then flailed out to grab my dad so she would not have to deal with it in the early 1960s where you couldn't talk about sex and abortions were illegal.  

I am very shaky now and I'm not sure this post explains why.  I just hope if someone else has been through this, we can PM.  And I will tell more about the grandpa part, but I also always knew he was a creep.  I just didn't know he raped my mom and fathered me.

I think I did know earlier.  Also my dad told me some parts of it but held back on the ""you're not my daughter"" part.  I love my dad, loved him and respected him.  So to finally accept I'm not his blood is really hard.  But I'm still his daughter.  He raised me.  It was hell sometimes.  But he was my dad.  I am sorry I'm not more articulate.

She did not freak out or creep out and is exactly the same to me as she was, and we talked for hours.  (I know, you're not surprised, but I am, kind of.  I do fear that people will just go ""ewwww."")  Then I went to a bar to see some other friends and I told them the basic fact.  (grandpa is my dad.) to explain why I look so punched-in-the-gut.

She's got a ridiculously bad case of pneumonia and other serious issues (low functioning kidneys, sepsis, and a condition called ARDS that is also affecting her lungs).  This all seems to be stemming from flu-like symptoms she had last week. 

She's young, just 26, and the doctors are optimistic that her age and otherwise relatively healthy body should be able to fight this off in time (albeit a slow process), but I know there's no way of telling.  

The pneumonia hasn't cleared up at all really and it's doing a number on her lungs.  She's been intubated and sedated since mid-afternoon on Tuesday.  She's barely conscious (because she's so sedated), and only kind of wakes up when nurses need to clean or move her. 

It's breaking my heart to see her like this.  We've only been dating for a short time, but we became best friends over the past year when I moved to Virginia from Philadelphia.  I've never connected with a girl like I have with her.  She's basically me, but gorgeous, funnier, smarter, and overall more awesome.  Once we started dating, I admitted to her that she reminds me of the line in Anchorman: ""I got no heart because a she-devil stole it! You wanna know the worst part of it...?

We had a muffin each whilst reminiscing about her old pet dog, and then we played the game with the eggs, and her first egg was lucky and victorious over the 3 of mine that she cracked. I peeled her egg for her, which proved very difficult because of it's hard shell, and we ate happily.

Before I had the chance to tell her I needed to leave for an appointment, she thanked me ""for doing all that you do"", and told me that **""You are my sunshine, my darling grand-daughter. I love you.""** . I was so happy that I could make out her words, because she was the quietest she's ever been today. I blubbered a bit and she held me until I rose to leave, kissing both her cheeks and her forehead.

I was replying to some of your replies and ended up spouting this, which I'd like to share: It was a lovely hour that has made all the difference to how I see the whole idea of going to visit her. **Today I did all of the things I knew I'd regret not doing if she passed suddenly.** Now it feels more of a blessing than a neglected, guilty chore.

Everyone told me to move on, but I couldn't live knowing he was out there, likely doing what he had done to me to someone else. Honestly, what happened in Steubenville was part of what made me think the most. What if someone had stopped them?

So I pressed charges. Went to the cops, to my school, told them everything. I was a wreck and came really close to the edge a few times, but I tried to keep my head as best I could. Luckily I had a few good family members and friends to watch my back and corroborate my story.

Of course, very soon after, he contacts me, pleading and apologetic, ""I am so fucked up, please don't hurt me for what I did."" At first I followed the school's advice and ignored him, but he tried again, and admitted one or two small things in the emails that I realized were quite damning. This gave me an idea. I wrote back and said, ""it's okay, X, what I really need from you is some closure. If you're willing to come get a coffee with me and talk it out, I'll drop the charges.""

Honestly, in retrospect, it was a really dumb thing to do, but he agreed to it. We met at a semi-popular coffee shop and I told friends where I was in case he tried anything harmful. I was so scared at first I could barely breathe-- we hadn't spoken or been less that ten yards away from each other in months-- but I sat down with him and we talked for over an hour. He admitted everything, I didn't even have to prompt him-- the rape, the physical abuse, the theft, down to apologizing for leaving a scar on my collarbone from throwing a CD at my head. Even stuff he did to the girl before me.

And I got it all on tape.

I got the WHOLE FUCKING THING on tape.

We hugged and I left without another word, and I had to sit in my car for a while afterwards just shivering. He has no clue. The laws where I live for such recordings are pretty clear and I think I may be able to use it as evidence in court. I can't believe it, I never ever expected he would admit to it. I must have listened to it six times already, just in shock. He always thought I was stupid, used to tell me all the time I wasn't as smart as he was, and I'm sure that played a part. He would never expect me to do anything like this.

I feel like crying. Who's fucking smart now?

EDIT: Thank you to everyone commenting with suggestions and encouragement, I am reading everything and there's been a lot of very good points made. I'm not sure yet what to do, it was pretty impulsive on my part (for the record, I do NOT recommend this method, if he had been in a violent mood or had cottoned to what I was doing, it could have ended quite badly). I do have a lawyer and I am going to ask her what she thinks before I do anything, and if she says it's not admissible, that is perfectly fine. First off I want to make sure meeting with him at all isn't going to affect the case. Really, it was dumb, don't recommend, but I do recommend reporting to the police. I was terrified at first but the officers who took the report and the ones after, including my victim advocate, were all very non-judgmental and kind.

I'm a regular redditor who's been looking in on this sub on and off for a while. Thought I'd finally get this off my chest.
As briefly as I can: About 20 years ago, I was in my young 20s living in a city in Texas. Had an acquaintance -- not a friend -- who lived in the same apartment complex. Me and my roommate would shoot hoops with him and his roomie sometimes or drink beers on the pool deck after work. Never went out socially. He seemed ok, as did his roommate -- not too bright, but a nice enough guy.

One day, came home from work (moving company) hot and sweaty and thought I'd take a swim. Was early in the afternoon, 2ish, and not too many folks were out in the heat. The complex pool had a little changing hut that had a little bar area attached. As I was approaching the gate, thought I heard a cry or shout, sounded like a young voice. Opened the gate and shut it behind me, which made a clang. Heard a thump from in the changing room, then the door bursts open and this kid comes running out. He's about 12, wearing a bathing suit. I didn't know him but had seen him around the pool and complex sometimes. He's crying and runs right past me, to the gate and out. I yell after him, ""You ok? What's wrong?"" Turn around to see this guy coming out of the changing room. He's also in a bathing suit, strappy t-shirt. He says, ""I scared him, that's all. Didn't know he was in there and went in without knocking."" But he's clearly nervous, twitchy. Walks past me mumbling something like ""It's cool, I'll let his folks know I just scared him."" I let him walk on by because I was kind of in shock, but it seemed clear to me he had been messing with this kid in there. I went back home and sat there just thinking about it for a while. I wanted to call the cops but was thinking that I didn't really see anything, and wasn't sure the kid would tell the cops what happened, and didn't want to call the cops if it was just a misunderstanding (and also, at the time, was not a big fan of the police). And I was also just enraged and nauseated and not sure what to do.

Some time goes by, avoided the guy and his roomie when I saw them. Was sick to my stomach half the time with anger but didn't really have anyone to talk to about it. About two weeks later, I saw the kid on the basketball court, shooting hoops with some other kids. I asked if I could play horse with them and they said sure. So we played a few games. I learned their names and that they all lived in the complex. I told them I'd get some gatorades and then we sat in the shade to cool off. When the kids got up to go play some more, I asked the one kid to sit a minute. Said I didn't know if he remembered, but a few weeks ago I went to the pool and saw him come running out of the changing room crying, and saw (guy's name) come out of the changing room right after. I said, ""(Guy) said he had come into the changing room without knocking and that you were just scared. That what happened?"" He had his head down and didn't say anything for a bit, and then he started crying. Man, the feels. He sobbed it out -- he was in the pool, guy had shown up, sat on the deck with his feet in the water shooting the shit with the kid. Then (guy) had told kid he had a deck of playing cards with naked ladies on them, did the kid want to look? Of course the kid did. So the guy says he doesn't want to take them out on the pool deck, in case some mom comes along -- he'll show them to him in the changing room. So the kid goes in with him, he starts showing him the cards, etc. Don't want to recount exactly, but he basically got the kid aroused and then fondled him, made the kid touch him. And then I banged the gate and the kid ran out.

I sat there with him for a little while and tried to say something useful but didn't really know what to do. I asked if he had told his parents or anyone else and he said no. I said maybe he should and he said it was just him and his older brother and their dad, and he thought his dad would get mad at him. Which also made me almost cry. So I told him it wasn't his fault and he shouldn't feel bad, and that if he ever wanted to talk about it -- or if that guy or anyone else ever gave him any trouble -- come find me or my roommate. He said ok, and also asked me not to tell anyone else.

So I head back to my apartment, never so enraged in my life. Get together my black jeans and long-sleeved dark t-shirt and batting gloves, and my aluminum baseball bat, and put them near my bed. Then I start spying on the guy. I already know he and his roommate usually stay in nights, and he doesn't have a steady girlfriend. From my front window on the second floor I can see across the compound to his front door on the lower level, so I rearrange our shitty little kitchen table and chairs so I can sit there and look out the window. My roommate asks me what's up one night after like three or four days of me sitting at the table every night with a book or magazine pretending to read, and I tell him I'm trying to not watch so much TV, but I'm basically staring at their front door the whole time.

Six days after my talk with the kid, I'm sitting at the table eating when I see their front door open and this asshole come out. He walks across the courtyard to the parking lot, gets in his truck and drives off. I tell my roommie I'm heading out to meet a friend for beers, throw my dark clothes and bat out the bedroom window and then leave. Go around, get my stuff, go to the pool changing room (irony) and change, and then back to the courtyard. Near the parking lot there's a fenced-off area where the dumpsters are. I open the gate, go in and crouch, and leave the gate open a little so I can see. I'm telling myself in my head the whole time, ""You can't kill him, you can't kill him."" He comes back about half an hour later. Gets out of his truck, starts walking toward me. He passes behind where I'm hidden toward the corner, to take a right back across the courtyard. I come out, run up behind and swing into his legs. He shouts, falls holding his leg. I stick the end of the bat against his neck and say ""If you make one more sound I'll bash your fucking head in."" Then I beat him, in the knees, stomach, ribs, arms, legs, back -- just about everywhere except his head. He was rolling around moaning and yelping when I connected, so I hit whatever he presented. This went on for a good 90 seconds or so. He was crying and slobbering and saying ""Please, no more, no more."" I'm panting and scared shitless but also still enraged, so I say ""You know EXACTLY what this is for, motherfucker. You say one word to anyone about this or touch any kid around here again and I will fucking kill you."" Then I ran off, went back and changed, ran around to the other side of the complex and over a fence to the complex next door, and chucked my clothes and bat in their dumpster. Then I walked around the block and back home.

About 20 minutes after I get back, watching TV with the roommie when we hear a siren and go out to see an ambulance and cop car pull up in the lot. The guy has crawled halfway across the courtyard, and someone saw him and called an ambulance. We're standing on our stoop watching along with everyone else in the complex as they load the guy onto a stretcher. I can't see his face but I keep expecting all heads to turn in my direction and the cops start up my stairs after me. But they take him away and the cops stay for a while, talk to his roommie and knock on a few doors asking if anyone saw anything. Apparently the answer is no because they leave after about an hour.

My roommate's all excited talking about it, wondering if it's a drug thing or whatever but I tell him I'm wiped and have to work early and go to bed. Where I'm basically up all night worried this guy will tell the cops it's me.
So next day, I come home from work and my roommate says he talked to the guy's roommate. The guy has six broken ribs, broken knee, couple bruised vertebra, fingers on both hands broken and contusions everywhere else. Will be in hospital for a week and then in a full leg cast for a few months. I ask do they know who it was or what it was about, and he says the roommate has no clue -- guy has no enemies he knows of, and police think it might have been an attempted robbery or carjacking that got out of hand, or maybe just marauding kids.

A week later the guy is home. He spends a couple weeks indoors, and then starts crutching around. He's black and blue all over and stays close to home. The only time I ever really had any contact with him after that was when me and the roommate brought over a 12-pack a couple days after he got back. We went in to say hi, he was in an easy chair with his leg up. We tell him the beer is to help with his recovery, he says he's not supposed to drink with the pain meds but fuck it, so we all crack a beer. I look at him a couple times but he doesn't seem anxious about me or wary, just in some pain. His roommate starts talking about how the police are useless, they have no idea who did it and probably never will, so forth. The guy doesn't say much, just that he's happy the mf didn't beat his ass to death. So we leave. I moved out a couple months later to go back to school and never saw or heard from the guy again or had any contact about it from police. I assumed at the time and still do that HE assumed that the boy's father was the one who beat him, and he didn't say anything to the cops because the whole story would have come out. I also never saw the kid again but I hope he knew about the guy's beating and assumed it was me.

So after years of no contact, you leave voicemail for Dad then you decided to call my dadâs superiors and demand someone respond to you.  (I refuse to say stepdad or stepbro â just because there is not blood link doesnât make them any less my family â my only family).  You insist you are my mother therefore deserve to attend my high school graduation.  Even though â 

You werenât there that Friday afternoon.  When I got home from school and found that all of your and my sisterâs stuff was gone.  With Dad on assignment and Brother staying with friends.  I realized fairly quickly that it was punishment.  Because I refused to lie and say Dad or Brother was abusing me.  Because I told my sister it was wrong to say she would.  And because I told Dad (and my teacher and the MPs and everyone else who asked) who gave me the bruise on my face and why.  You werenât there that Friday night when I finally fell asleep on the sofa.  You werenât there Saturday.  Or Sunday, when I finally realized that you werenât coming back and called Brother at his friends to confess that youâd left and taken my older sister but left me behind.

You werenât there for the following weeks when I was left with strangers.  When I was labeled as âabandonedâ.  When Dad was finally able to push through the adoption papers that had thankfully already been in progress.  You didnât come to court for the hearing to finalize the adoption.  You didnât come to court for the hearing to end your parental rights, even though I know you were personally served with the summons.  You werenât there to see me weeping as I thanked the Judge.  I send him a card every year on the anniversary of that day, telling him how my life is, and grateful I still am that he made such a wonderful decision.  Did you ever wonder?  Would the court give custody of a tween age girl to a single Military Dad?  Did you care that I could have ended up in foster?

You werenât there when we found out that what I was suffering from was not regular aches and pains but something more serious.  You never responded to our requests for family medical history when the doctors were trying to figure out what was wrong.  I still donât know if I inherited this or if it was just a twist of fate.  You werenât there when I realized that every plan I had for my future, every dream I was focused on would be impossible.  You werenât there when I had to completely change my life.  

You werenât there when we transferred twice in two years.  New schools, new towns, new doctors.   You werenât there when Dad had to leave Brother and I for months.  You werenât there when I worried every day that something would happen to him.  You werenât there when we got the call that he had been hurt.  You werenât there when we learned he would be alright.

You werenât there when I got asked on my first date.  You werenât there to see Dad and Brother scare the boy so bad that he barely spoke to me that night.  You werenât there when I got asked to my first formal dance.  You werenât there to see Dadâs face when I came out in my first formal dress.   You werenât there when that boy said he didnât like me anymore and I cried for days.

You werenât there when I learned how to drive.  You werenât there when I got my license and when Dad bought me that used Jeep.  You werenât there to hear me squeal so high that Brother still claims I ruptured his eardrum.

You werenât there.  You never called.  You never wrote, or emailed, or anything else.  You never contacted me at all.  But youâre still my mother, right?  Even though you never asked how I am, what I was doing.  You never told us how my sister was or where.  Never even told us where you were.  Just a demand for an invitation because you deserve to be there when I graduate high school.

When I graduate high school?  Bitch that was LAST YEAR.  I just finished my first year of college.  
You werenât there.

Proud to call myself

I can't get properly aroused because I'm around people and it's not like I'm going to pull one of these girls. I'm trying to chat over the music to my friends which is hopeless and one of my friends was fucking red faced goggle eyed starring at the girls, which was great I always wanted to hang around with him when he had a big lustful boner. 


My friends know I'm not into it so decide to get me a lap dance and I'm sitting there with this amazing social dynamic were I pity the stripper and hope she's doing this to get through college and she pity me for having to pay her to dance in front of me. I'm not allowed to feel her body or express any sexual energy so I sit just there smiling trying to make her feel good, ""yes deer you are very attractive I am glad I'm here rather than home with a cup of tea"" point is brothels rule strip clubs drool.

We have $200 for the next two weeks to stretch for gas, a baby-sitter since my daughter's school is closed until January because of black mold, speech therapy for my son, and various bills that just plain aren't going to get paid. 

So yeah, we're on food stamps. We buy some of the better meats because you know what? This is the one place where food-wise I know that I can buy what's good for my family. I have no money to spend elsewhere, so we're going to splurge a bit and get some sirloin tonight to pan-grill since I'm not going to be able to buy my kids Christmas gifts. If my daughter wants 200 of her favorite apples (honeycrisp - holy shit they're good) then I'M GOING TO FUCKING BUY THEM WITH MY SNAP CARD.

Hold your fucking judgement to yourself, I don't want your snide looks. 

I can see how those that are poor are overweight - they're trying to stretch their food stamp dollars and the way to get the most food for your dollar is to buy that preservative-loaded crap. Luckily my dad taught me how to cook starting with basic ingredients, and we don't have to do that. And knowing that you can have $500 to spend on food makes you want to be overindulgent. You have no money to spend elsewhere, so you want to feel like a king somewhere - and the grocery store is it. 

So fuck you and your judgement. I'm going to eat steak tonight instead of ramen, and I'm going to wish for the day when my husband gets a job and I can get off the pariah SNAP card.

But then you moved in with me, and here we are, six years later. Now it seems like we absolutely do not ever for any reason have sex unless it's the asscrack of dawn, when you hump *my* poor, innocent asscrack for a few minutes, rousing me from my slumber as many as four hours prematurely, then try to stick me on top because *you're* too fucking tired even though *your* ass went to bed at ten. 


Is it over if I comply? Can I go back to bed? No. You'll be back in 20 minutes asking if I'm up for the day yet and telling me what a disappointing shitbag I am for not being a fucking morning person on four hours of fucking sleep. Spoiler alert: I'm not up for the day. I'm fucking tired because you only let me sleep for four fucking hours before you decided that we weren't having sex for the next two months unless I slammed my poor, confused, dry clam on your first boner of the goddamn morning right the fuck now. 


Can I go back to sleep? Of fucking course not. Now that I got up and started humping something, my sleep cycle's all confused and I just lay there fucking miserable wondering where my Saturday morning sleep-in time went. Your selfish vampire cock sucked it all up and left me a husk of the person I used to be on a Saturday before you decided that only the first boner you get for the week is worth using. 


So what if I say no? Oh god, how dare I! Your poor feelings, your poor penis. I guess now you have to go sit in the bathroom for a full two hours while I sit there tasting my sour mouth unable to brush my fucking teeth, despite how 'passionate' you are about making sure I wake up before the fucking sun does to do exciting activites, because your poor feelings are so hurt. 


And if I ask for sex later? HAHAHA, NO. YOU CAN'T HAVE SEX WITH ME, YOU DIDN'T WAKE UP AT SIX FUCKING AM ON A SATURDAY TO GO COWGIRL CRAZY AND GIVE ME A BLOWJOB. THAT'S THE ONLY SEX I LIKE, SEX THAT YOU GET NO ENJOYMENT OUT OF WHATSOEVER. I CAN'T EVEN DEVELOP A BONER AT ANOTHER TIME OF DAY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SEEM CONSENSUAL.

I don't even want to fucking have it, because I know it'll be an exercise in patience while you berate me for choosing condoms as a birth control method yet again and simultaneously refuse to learn what a clitoris is for the thousandth time. Do you want a fat, crazy emotional pregnant bitch? Because that's what hormonal birth control makes me, fat, emotional, out of control, and when I inevitably miss a pill because I'm fucking forgetful? Guess what, happy father's day. We don't want kids, use the condom and stop bitching. If you don't like it, there's plenty of fish in the sea... who would be happy to trap you into raising a squealing little shit machine because you suddenly don't feel anything through condoms.

My grandmother's cat hadn't been able to urinate all day and was becoming increasingly uncomfortable and upset. We decided it probably constituted an emergency and rushed him to the 24-hour vet, where several hundred dollars' worth of tests revealed that he had a blocked urinary tract and his bladder was swollen to the point of rupturing, as well as his kidneys being badly damaged. 

We were told that a $2,000 surgery *might* save him, but that he would have permanently compromised organ function and would need extra care, special food and regular vet visits for the rest of his (poorer quality) life. My grandmother lives off Social Security, and my mother is a school teacher; I knew as soon as the vet started talking what the outcome was going to end up being. We deliberated for a while, my mother and grandmother tried every way they could think of to rearrange and reallocate money, but there was no way we could afford it. 

Neither my mom nor grandma could handle staying with him, but I couldn't let him go all alone, scared and in pain. I stayed by his side, scratching in his favorite spot under his chin and stroking his head while they dosed him. He purred, stretched out his front paws and kneaded the sleeve of my hoodie as he gradually fell asleep.

As we stood in the lobby filling out the last of the paperwork, a family ran in with a bloodied mess of a dog wrapped in an old t-shirt. Their neighbor's dog had escaped and completely torn theirs apart. I watched as the vets took the dog into the back, leaving its tearful owners behind. A woman came in from the back and explained to the family that their dog was in critical condition and it would be very expensive to save it. As they looked over the pricing sheet, the wife broke down in sobs and the husband shook his head in resignation. The whole lobby was deathly quiet as we shared in this family's pain.

Then, a young couple (seriously no more than 25 years old) who had just come out of the back with a tiny puppy stood up, walked to the counter, and said ""We'd like to help them. How much can we pay to get their dog triaged and start its treatment?"". And then, the guy got out his credit card and paid to help save this family's dog. The young woman put her arm around the dog's sobbing owner and comforted her.

Fellow Redditors, I have never seen such an incredible act of selflessness and compassion. This young couple had just paid who knows how much to have their own pet treated. They had never seen these people before. But they unhesitatingly gave as much as they could to prevent a family from being broken. For the first time in a long time, I felt totally awed by the humanity of total strangers.

I really just wanted to get this off my chest, so if you've read this far, thanks for listening.

I was walking back to my office when it began to rain. I only had a hoodie on for protection from the elements and I happened to look like shit today because I didn't have time to take a shower or change my clothes this morning.

Anyway, I'm standing at an intersection waiting for the light to change when I catch a super pretty girl (won't go into specifics but she was just my taste superficially) standing next to me. Our eyes meet for a second and I grin sheepishly, somewhat embarrassed that I had been ""caught"" admiring her facial features. 

She must have taken the smile to mean that I felt silly about getting caught in the rain unprepared because she said, ""if this rain gets much worse, you're welcome to get under here with me,"" tilting her head up slightly towards her umbrella. It wasn't a big umbrella so if I took her up on her offer, we'd be in pretty close quarters...

I shook my head and stopped that thought right there, remembering that even though we've been having a ton of problems and haven't slept together in months, I still had a girlfriend. I brushed her off, saying ""oh youd be surprised at how absorbent this thing is (beat while I realize what I just said)...no wait, that's exactly the problem."" She laughed and began to walk as the light turned green. ""Suit yourself!"" She said with a smile before continuing on.

In those few moments, I wanted so badly to catch up to her and just introduce myself and try to arrange meeting up someday to chat. I did tha whole stupid thing where I imagined what it would be like to date her and maybe even hit it off and fall in love in all the ways I really wanted to but I stopped.

I was heartbroken. I owe my girlfriend an explanation of the truth about how I feel so that we can split up and she can have a shot at having the kind of relationship she deserves.

**Super quick edit because I'm at work**: thanks for all the thoughtful responses folks. Means a lot that you'd take time out of your day to offer helpful advice. I just want to make one thing clear that seemed flimsy in my post: it wasn't the simple act of casual attraction to a stranger that makes me want to leave my gf. I haven't felt in love with her for a while (even though I care about her a great deal) and I can't seem to get that ""she's my best friend"" feeling everyone always recommends looking for. The Umbrella Girl just stood out as a real world example (as opposed to a thought that only takes place in my head) of how Im not thinking about a future w gf but with some undefined person.

Also one little, but heavy shred of context: before I met current gf, I did have a girlfriend I considered my best friend. Someone who I could be my true, unedited self around, flaws and all, with complete acceptance. Totally would have proposed to her but Unfortunately, she passed away. So I do know what it feels like to have a relationship I'd fight for, even through the worst times (and we had our share of downs we overcame), but I'm not feeling that in this relationship.

Well, I needed my big truck. I would haul materials in it. Travel long distances. Shit, going to the grocery store was an hour drive! Sure, I made some unnecessary modifications, like a lift, bigger tires, stronger bumpers, etc. But this is something I used every day! Can you really fault me that much for treating my lifeblood like a treasured object, setting it set up just the way I want it?

Then there is the criticism of hunting. For every deer I took, that's 80 pounds of meat I didn't buy in the store, supporting corporations with bad practices and massive scale farming that does more damage to the land they use then an entire army of rednecks could do over 3 lifetimes.
I kept my area clean, because I love it. I burned wood for heat, because it meant one less gas well, or less coal ripped from the earth to supply a power plant. Plus wood is an entirely renewable resource. It just takes time. Also, exercise in the fresh air, which is far better then using equipment at a gym that is made of metal, shipped to a concrete building powered by coal electricity, that most of these people drive their cars to anyhow.

They see me, my beard, my boots, my big truck, (which I only drive when I am going long distances or hauling something anyhow. I have a Ford Focus for about town, and parking my 23' truck in the city is a headache) and the hate fairly radiates from them. Every time I try to discuss the whys behind my lifestyle, they shut their ears. They don't care how much good I do, how much of it is truly necessary for country folk, how the nearest store isn't a short bike ride or bus away. Or they say ""just move to a place closer then!"" No. Well, actually, I had to, for work. But what I really want is to piss off my back porch, wake up to birds and not sirens, not smell exhaust when I go for a walk. I want to ride my mountain bike by a stream or a trail that doesn't have homeless camps set up beside it, trash and beer cans everywhere, water so polluted you don't dare swim in it.

Yes, my offroad tendencies are absolutely frivolous. But so are some of the things urban people do! 

Edit: something I want to add. My Giant Wasteful Truck, it gets around 20 MPG city driving, around 25 highway all loaded up. Dual turbo diesel coupled to an aftermarket manual transmission. Plus I bought it used, so I didn't make a new carbon footprint when I bought it. Furthermore, I bought it with money I made from cleaning up dumps in the country and selling the scrap metal. So there! Tell me how your brand new hybrid with the lithium batteries makes less of a footprint then my truck!",,False,,t5_2ranw,1364787138.0,,,True,t3_1beac7,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1beac7/yeah_im_a_stupid_redneck/,

*Should I tell people about it*?

Sure it's going to suck, but hey, it aint no ones fault and there's nothing anyone can do about it so why fuss over it aye?

Obviously it's going to become more apparent the closer I get to kicking the bucket and I'll have to tell people then, but I want people to remember me as I am now. Young, fit, *fun* and at peace. I sure as hell don't want people remembering me as some frail old cranky asshole strapped into a hospital bed shitting my pants and eating mush.

I guess what I'm trying to ask y'all is, **How should I be going about this?**

I haven't visited him in jail since I was 12. He went into prison a couple months before I was born. I just found out via Facebook that he was released. My cousin put up pictures of him and my brother. He's holding my 1 year old niece. I've been terrified of this day my entire life terrified and now it's here and I'm wide awake in shock I guess? I changed my name and moved far away. I haven't seen my family in such a long time. He's living around the corner from my mother. Over the years he's sent creepy cards and has made death threats. Last I talked to him was 4 years ago he contacted me after 10 years of not speaking/no visits. When I found out what he did I cut him off. He sent me an email after 10 years complaining he's been there too long and they took away his ""good time"" his only excuse for murder being he was young and dumb. I wrote back with a lifetime of anger filling page after page. He made violent threats and now here he is. I find out through photos on fucking facebook. Thats not what monsters are supposed to look like. Like me. But at the same time a stranger who happens to look like my brother. Numbing and strange. I'm so afraid for my mother and sisters, afraid for the public, myself, my brothers impending disappointment. I just typed this all over the place, how can I even tell you if this doesn't make sense to me either? Is this seriously happening? God, keep them safe.

UPDATE: I had so many responses but I'm on my cell phone so here goes:

My dad was stationed at an army base in my hometown. He was taking some mechanical classes for the national guard. He caught a cab after partying late and shared it with his victim. She was intoxicated and he was on drugs, not sure which. He made a move on her when they got back to base and she rejected him. So he drug her to a dark area behind the dumpsters where he sexually assaulted her and repeatedly beat her in the head with a brick after attempting to strangle her. He then threw her in the dumpster and lit her body on fire. She died sometime during the sexual assault from blunt force trauma and asphyxiation.
I used to visit my dad in jail once or twice a year since birth with my psychotic and abusive paternal grandmother. The last time (at 12) he made sexual comments on the phone to me and I refused to see him the next day. I hadn't known why he was in jail until my 20s all I knew was that he's a pervert. In my 20s my mother and maternal grandmother talked about it all and I found out why he was in there and she showed me cards and things sent to her home for my mother and I. Some were benign and sad, some were maniacal and violent, some were downright incestuous. He insisted after not speaking to or seeing him for 26 years that my mother will see him and fall in love. He's a sociopath, he can only pretend to have emotions like empathy and guilt. He is not sorry for what he's done, he's more focused on what he's lost, how people portray him, he considers himself a victim. They had started an email program for inmates in my 20s and my rant and rage email was after seeing the cards and finding out the truth. It sounds weird but part of me wants to find the victims family, to give them the apology they'll never receive from him. I want to tell them that he won't have his daughter either. Its weird, I know. Also, op is a female! I have one of those fake fb names with no pictures, no address, nothing. I just use it to see my family live. My cousins on fb have been through hell and back with me, very badly abused etc, they wouldn't give me away. Only my mother knows my new legal name/address. I visit them not vice versa. I saw him on my brothers fb he contacted me asking me to please call him. I haven't spoken to my brother in years either. I have a new security system, a big Bordeaux (like a mastiff) and a big strong husband... Who knows absolutely none of this. Not my new name, nothing. I may be ""overreacting"" but my paternal family tried to kidnap me as a child several times. They all hold decent influential government jobs. They call me insane and crazy but they're always trying to find me. They want to shut me up because of all the crime (human trafficking etc) I've seen them do.

We would provide information to terminally ill patients which explained the laws regarding ending their own lives as well as well the techniques and medications involved in hastening their deaths. It was a counseling service which provided clients the option of dying with dignity (always at their own hand).

I left the group about eight years ago when it merged with Derek Humphry's Hemlock Society. I was briefly affiliated with another nonprofit right to die network but felt it necessary to leave upon discovering how careless they were with records and privacy. This turned out to be a wise, yet regrettable decision.

For the past five years I've been on my own, helping those who wish to die take their own lives. I do not discriminate between terminal, physical, or mental illness. My only rule is to never encourage or discourage an individual's decision to die. I simply explain what their options are and how they may procure what is necessary for the method they decide upon. Only about half of my clients make the decision to exit. Many simply want the relief of knowing it's there if the pain becomes unbearable.

When working with the aforementioned groups, I was present at several deaths. None of these individuals regretted exiting. All of them were appreciative to have the option to go peacefully when they saw fit. Still, I regret living in a society which requires me to do this in secret. I don't feel comfortable working with anyone else since I have known individuals who've testified against group members to avoid the possibility prison. There's also been at least one circumstance where a relative of a client would have retaliated had he known I provided the information she used to take her own life. It's difficult doing this alone while living amongst people who consider suicide taboo under any circumstance.

During the summer of 2004, when I was 18, I failed to save a drowning man.


My big sister, her two year old son, and I decided to go to the lake to swim. It was a school day during August, and the swimming area was pretty empty. The only other people there was a small family. A man, his wife, their two children, and the wife's sister. The man and his sister in-law were in the water, and the wife and kids were sitting on the bank.


About half an hour later I hear yelling, and splashing. I look over to see the man, and his sister in-law racing each other towards the deeper water. This was a typical activity, so I just went back to enjoying my own swim. A few moments later the yelling turned to screams, and the splashing got wilder. My sister asked me i thought they needed help, but I said I think they are still playing around. So we watched them, and then the sister in-law came running out of the water screaming, and I realized this was serious.


Since we had my young nephew, my sister had to stay on the bank with him, and so I swam alone to where the splashing had last come from. I started diving down as quickly as I could. I couldn't see anything in the murky water, and I wasn't even sure if I was in the right spot. I kept coming up for air and looking to the family for help, but they were screaming frantically in Spanish, and I couldn't understand them. (I found out later that none of them knew how to swim, and that's why they couldn't help me.) So I just kept diving. Each time I dove down to find nothing but cloudy water, I would come back up feeling more frantic. I started to realize that I was running out of time. 


At that moment four men come running towards the water, and I scream to them that a man has drowned. I see them step into the water, and so I keep diving. When I look at them again I see that they are just standing there watching me. I asked them to help me, and I will never forget their response. They said ""We have our clothes, and shoes on."" I couldn't understand why this mattered. I still don't. Take your fucking shoes off, and help me! What the fuck?


Another minute passes, and I kept diving down, and coming up empty handed. The last time I resurfaced a cop yelled for me to get out of the water. I didn't want to give up though. I told him there was a man drowning down there, and he told me there was nothing more I could do, and to get out of the water now.


As I walked limply out of the water, and onto the bank, I saw the man's wife crumbled on the ground with her sister holding her close. Her guttural screams tore a hole in my heart. She was broken, and I had failed her. I had failed to save her husband as he drowned right in front of her.


I walked past her to where my sister sat with her son, and the mans children. An old couple had stopped, and they were sitting with my sister and the now fatherless children. I kneeled down, and the old woman touched my arm and squeezed. She started praying, and all I could do was stare wide eyed at these innocent, and oblivious children. They were both younger than five, and clueless of what had just happened. I didn't cry. I just stared.


Once the emergency vehicles arrived, and then the reporters, my sister and I decided to leave. I didn't want to speak to a reporter. I didn't want to speak to anyone. Once we were in my sister's car I broke down. I started sobbing, and I didn't stop for hours. My sister had family come over to be with us, and I remember them offering me a Xanax to calm me down. I took it, and was able to eventually stop crying, and fall asleep.


I will never forgot that day. I will never forget the screams I heard from the man's wife. The sight of her crumpled on her knees will never leave my mind. I wonder sometimes how she is now, how the kids are. I've tried looking for reports from that day to see if her name would be there, but I haven't had any luck. I just wish I could have the chance to hug her, and to tell her how sorry I am that I couldn't find him. I wanted so desperately to help them, and I still feel the guilt of failing. If I just hadn't hesitated when I first heard the screams, maybe I would have found him in time. I know what ifs are pointless, but I can't help it. 


Everyone told me that it was for the best that I didn't reach him. They said that he would have just pulled me under with him since I wasn't a very strong swimmer, and I was a small 110 lb. girl. I knew that they might be right, but I didn't care. There was no way that I would have just sat back, and not tried to help. His life mattered just as much as my own, perhaps even more since he was a parent, and I was not at that time. Self preservation was that last thing on my mind in that moment. Doing all I could to save him was all that mattered. But I failed. I didn't save him. And his children lost their father before they were even old enough to understand what that means.


August 4, 2004 is the day I will never forget.


**Edit**: I just want to say thank you for all of the comforting, and encouraging comments. It was hard to share this story after holding it in for so long, and I truly appreciate all the support I've been given here. I have not sought out counseling for this, but I might just do so. I've been through, and have seen a lot in my life, and I think counseling would be a big help. Just talking about it here has relieved some of the weight of it.


I do not consider myself a hero though. Not because I failed to save this man, but because what I did was just instinct. To me there was nothing to think about. A man needed help, and so I tried to help him. As for the men that just watched, well I can only imagine that they must have felt overwhelmed, and unprepared for walking into that situation. Maybe they were able to realize it was a loss before I was able to. I just felt that if there was a tiny chance that he could be revived then why not try to find him and do so.


Again, thank you. I was surprised by how many people cared enough to read, and respond to my post. It really does mean a lot to me. Oh!

My girlfriend (19) and I (21) have been seeing each other for a couple of months now. I've never cared so much about someone this much before in my life, and I truly feel like I'm in love for the first time.

I'm her first real boyfriend, and I've been her first for everything - so I wanted to tell her how I felt in the best way possible.
She was born with a book in her hands. She never stops reading, she studies English at university and has at least 3 bookshelves packed to the brim. Naturally, being such a book worm, she wants a career to do with literature when she graduates - in particular, becoming an author.

She's always wrote these cute little short stories as a hobby and only kept them to herself, but there was one story in particular she worked on for months - creating intricate character plots and relationships. It was her crowning achievement in writing. I don't know how, but I managed to persuade her to let me read it, so she sent me a copy via email.

I'm not a literary expert, I've only ever read 3 proper books in my life! But I could tell that she had poured her heart and soul into this piece. That's where I got the idea of how to tell her I loved her. The book was written in the style of personalised letters sent from each character to one another, so I decided to add my own letter at the very end of the book, addressed to her, confessing my feelings for her. With the final sentence reading: 

""I know I'm not great about showing my feelings for you, but I hope you realise that you mean more to me than any other person I've ever met.
I love you. dpaddyb x""

I had the book professionally printed on hardback copy and wrapped it up for her, gifting it to her yesterday. It came as a total surprise to her, and I was finally able to tell her that I loved her for the first time. She absolutely loved it and she replied the same back - I don't think I've ever been this happy.

She then joked, and said that she couldn't ever top that as a gift back - and I meant it from the heart when I said that she's already given me the best gift, knowing she feels the same way.",,False,,t5_2ranw,False,,,True,t3_1ek25j,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ek25j/how_i_told_my_girlfriend_i_loved_her_for_the/,

I want to thank everyone for their input in the original thread. It became a lot more popular than I imagined and I figured I would update you all. It is a small, and major update at the same time.

In all my range of emotion, I forgot to do one *really* obvious thing. After a few people chimed in about phone calls, I realized that I hadn't called the place to see if I could get them to confirm if she were there.

The call went as follows:

Nurse/receptionist/whatever (will now be known as phone lady):
""Hello, how may I direct your call?""

Me: ""Hello. I was wondering if you could help me with something. My girlfriend is currently attending one of your trials, and I haven't heard from her in a couple days, and I was supposed to hear from her yesterday. I was wondering if you, or someone else, could take my number and have her call me?""

Phone Lady: ""I can do that for you. Is she inpatient? What's her first and last name, please?""

Me: ""Yes, inpatient. Her name is So-and-so.""

Phone Lady: ""Just so that I heard that right, her last name is spelled s-o?""

Me: ""Yes, s-o.""

Phone Lady: ""One moment please... Can I have her date of birth?""

Me: ""Of course. 1/1/11""

Phone Lady: ""Hmmm... And it is at (facility name) in (city name)?
*They have trials all over the US, which is why she confirmed the specific city name.*

Me: ""Yes, definitely (city name).""

Phone Lady: ""We don't have anyone in our database by that name.""

Me: ""Oh, I'm sorry to have bothered you. I must have the wrong place. Have a good afternoon.""

And that's how the phone call ended. 

I e-mailed my girlfriend saying that I just called the place, and that she wasn't in the database. That I was getting nervous since I hadn't heard from her yesterday, like she said, and to let me know what was up.

I'm not completely accusing her, yet. I'm open to an explanation and her side, but unless she is able to call me today from a number that is directly connected to the facility, I'm going to have trouble believing anything but the obvious.

I work 60+ hours a week, and I am a fat 22 year old girl with no boyfriend and severe depression. The best part of my life is my job, because I do what I love every day. But then I have to go into the real world sometimes and interact with people. 

So I just got out of the hospital after finding out I have to miss a week of work, because I have a busted up leg. I'm going to feel weird ,guilty and useless to the world for this whole week because of having to miss work. But as I'm internalizing this stress and also freaking out over the state of my leg itself, I decide to go into the seven eleven before I enter inside my apartment to cry and/or call my mom and/or grandparents. 

Just like I always do, I made a motherfucking b-line to the funyuns. It looked like there weren't any at first, but I found one bag hidden under a few bags of fllamin' hot cheeto fries. 

Then I am about to search for a beverage of choice, but on my way over to the back wall of coolers, a little 7 11 brand chocolate cake roll catches my eye. A rolled up piece of chocolate cake with some cheap-ass crisco based buttercream vanilla frosting, compressed in a plastic clam-shell container, beaming up at me marked $2.49. I snatched that shit up, grabbed a big ass orange soda, and headed to the counter. 

The lady is scanning my shit. Picks up the cake roll, and goes ""ohhhh"" and makes a big deal about it turning it around in her head. She starts bobbing around acting dramatic, and fakes hesitance when she asks me, "" so tell me one thing, are you going to eat that whole thing by yourself?"" 

I pause for a moment, trying to contain myself.

""Uh yeah... at least i'm in here supporting your store buying stuff every day. ""

Probably not the best thing I could have come up with in response.... but still better than the  ""fuck you"" I had built up in my head. Don't fuck with me when I'm in 7/11 getting my stress snack on. I know I have a problem. I know. I know. Just let me have my cake roll and go hide in my apartment-fort. Thank you.

I had an early life which worked against me to make having an intimate relationship with another person difficult to impossible. I was severely abused and neglected by my mom and her dealer/boyfriend and as a result wound up with a less than warm personality and incapable of trusting another person. In addition to that, I was obese throughout most of my school years (275lbs at my peak) and picked on over it at home and school, leaving me unable to wrap my head around the concept that a woman might find me attractive.

Even after I was free of an abusive home life and lost over 90 lbs, I still couldn't really socialize effectively with anyone on a platonic or romantic level. I never had more than three friends or so at college and only made it to first base with my only girlfriend and third with a fresh-off-the-boat girl from Iran who said she just wanted to have sex to get it over with, but chickened out when it came time to do the deed. 

After college I lost my small network of friends due to moves and the one who stayed being a negligent asshole. I gradually made peace with having no family or friends of note and being doomed to virginity forever. I really didn't think it was so bad; I've never been a people person and now that I had no friends around, I didn't have anyone prying into my lackluster romantic life. I had basically given up trying to get laid.

Then I met the sweetest, most beautiful girl I could've ever imagined. She's a 19-year-old international student from South America who works at a restaurant I frequent. She's tall for a woman, has the pale skin of a Spaniard, dark hazel eyes, chestnut brown hair, and an almost unreal hip-to-waist ratio.

I noticed her at a coffee house and approached her because I saw a familiar face. I saw that she was working on an MBTI-related paper and lent her a hand during which I saw her type was compatible with mine. During our time there, she got really close to me and was feeling my muscles asking me about what I do when I work out. I noticed she was obviously in to me, so I asked and she agreed to go on a date with me so I took her to a scenic, exotic place deep downtown that I knew she'd love. I gave her a beautiful, but modest flower arrangement that made her light up when I handed it to her. 

The seating was in a courtyard and I bribed the hostess for a circular booth that overlooked the whole place. She kept telling me how beautiful it was and I told her about how it reminded me of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. She wasn't familiar with the story, so I got to tell her about the romantic story of King Nebuchadnezzar, who spent years and an untold fortune on a palace that would give his wife a piece of her beautiful homeland in their less fertile new home.
During conversations later on, she moved closer to me and somehow I gauged the perfect time to make the move and we kissed each other passionately. 

I bought a couple bottles of wine on the way back to her place, but we only had a couple of glasses each before we were too busy making out to drink. After about three hours of making out, she says  in that other-worldly accent ""get me naked."" And that's how it happened.

I write this partially out of embarrassment that it took me this long, bewilderment that I got that lucky the first time, and to offer some encouragement to people who may be in a similar situation (which I've noticed is fairly common in these parts.)

It's his friends, random girls from different pages, acquaintances, celebrities... mostly liking them but occasionally commenting on how beautiful they are. No comments are overtly sexual, but it can really hurt and it makes me feel as if I'm less special to him if he calls every girl out there beautiful. Sometimes, after he's added a girl as a friend, he'd go through all of her profile pictures and like every single one EXCEPT the ones with her boyfriend or male friends in them. And then I'd get this flood of pictures of the same girl on my newsfeed. It makes me feel like shit sometimes. 

We talked about it before and I said it wasn't an issue because at the time it really wasn't at all, but I had no clue how much of it I'd be seeing and how much it could hurt me. However, I would never tell him to stop because I feel that would be too controlling and that I have no right to dictate what he does, just like I wouldn't like to have it done to myself. 

Also, I noticed a trend in the girls he likes - they all have things in common... and I also don't look anything like that. In fact, I'm the polar opposite. 

He says I'm the most beautiful girl in the world to him, but sometimes I think he's just saying it because he feels it's something one should say in a relationship. 

I can't help it. I know it's lame and makes me a bad girlfriend to have these feelings of insecurity, but no matter what I tell myself, it breaks my heart and I compare myself to these girls every day.

That men are just waiting around all the time and all a girl has to do is crook her finger. And more specifically, all a girl in a relationship needs to do to indicate to her man that she wants sex is ""touch it"" (recent front page post). Well all I can say is that in this girl's experience all of that is a GODDAMNED LIE and every time I see it I feel so inadequate it's really rather crushing.

I am a 24 year old reasonably attractive (I think), sane, happy girl with (in my opinion) a healthy attitude towards the opposite sex. But every time I have been forward with a guy I have gotten either completely rejected, a truly unenthusiastic response, or accepted and then never spoken to again.

Now, most of my soul crushing rejections were in one relationship and I am smart enough to realize that the problem there was the dude, and not necessarily me, but let me just say that it was NOT as easy as ""touching it"". Imagine offering no-strings-attached, absolutely no reciprocal action expected blow jobs and getting turned down. Imagine having your long distance boyfriend asking asking before a visit to not have sex that weekend because ""knowing I wanted it gave him anxiety"". Imagine only allowing yourself to ask for sex once a visit and trying not to be hurt when he sighs and says ""fine. but you have to get on top.""

So yeah, that relationship was fucked. But my other experiences:
1) (senior year of high school) finally getting up the courage to jump my best friend of 3 years' bones and giving him a blow job. Dude stopped talking to me. literally, we had driven to school together for two years and over night he stopped talking to me. 
2) had a guy who I was convinced was really into me. Sent him a flirty text only to be laughed at.

Now imagine getting on reddit and having everybody but EVERYBODY saying ""all a girl has to do is be up for sex to have sex"". Wanna know how it makes me feel? fucking awful. I feel like I am the biggest failure of a woman and that my body is disgusting and I seriously must be really jacked up that I can't get a guy to fuck me when it's supposedly sooooo easy. 

so there, here's getting off my chest why I tear up every time I see a post on here about how easy it supposedly is for girls.

I rather enjoy the perspective that age gives me, especially and particularly when observing the day-to-day interactions of social sites such as this.

Only having been here for a few days, I've begun to come to some basic conclusions. Now, before the apes start rattling their cage bars, I am certain that over time, some of these conclusions will bear out to be in error. Newsflash: That's how life works, and I'm OK with it.

Observation number one: There are WAY too many people in these ( forums, rooms, subreddits, whateverthefuck you want to call them ) that assign entirely too much importance to how many 'votes' they get. 

I haven't seen such retarded clique-ness as this since grade school. Who gives a hairy monkey's ass how many tools vote your post up or down?  Are you running for some sorta populist political office? Speak your REAL mind and let the damned chips fall where they may. Piss on popularity. The crowd you are so keen to run with will turn on you and eat your ass before you can form a lucid thought about it. To hell with them.


Observation number two: Holy FUCK, what the hell sorta mindless, robotic, zombified Stepford Children are we putting in colleges these days? I've heard more original thoughts in a parrot farm. Again, it seems as if there is some sorta Zerg hive-mind at work here.  If my tinfoil wasn't so tight, I'd swear someone managed to incarnate Kerrigan and she has a shit ton of you under her spell.

Get some original thoughts into your addled heads and question the shit they are spoon feeding you in these indoctrination mills. I think of all the progress that was made in the sixties to get out from under the brainwashing and it fills me with sorrow to see it all gone to waste.


Observation number three. Political Correctness has run the fuck amok. Everyone is so fucking terrified of speaking their mind and possibly ""offending"" someone that no real dialogue can take place.

Grow some fucking balls, will ya? Words are just that, words. No more, no less. If you wanna be a fag, fine, be a happy cocksucker, but don't get your pubes in a twist just because someone acknowledged the fact that you are a fag. Same with the carpet munchers and trans-testicles.  If you weigh more than you really ought, YOU ARE FAT! Deal with it, ffs. If you can't see, yer fuckin BLIND. How the fuck is any meaningful progress supposed to be made when nobody can say anything? And don't hand me any of that pussy-assed 'sensitivity' shit, either. These games of semantics have been going on forever. 'Victims' will always find a way to be offended, no matter what words are used....it is what they live for. There's nothing pejorative in an accurate descriptive word or phrase, so get the fuck over yourselves.


I think that's enough for now, as I can already imagine the red-faced screaming and frothing at the mouth just these three points will induce in the ""save the victims"" crowd.

I literally was just walking to my car after getting a coffee... just living my life as usual. I was kind of sleepy after a casual meeting at work. Did I look at you the wrong way? So sorry I offended you, perhaps I took too much splenda. 

You ruined my day with your rude ignorant rant. You gave me anxiety now I wake up having anxiety attacks. Do you think assaulting an incredibly small female 1/3rd your size and following her makes you an example for man and woman kind? If I hadn't threatened to call the police would you have assaulted me? You certainly looked like you were going to try. You were marching towards me with such rage... what did I do to you? Do you feel better knowing I won't feel safe walking alone again for a very long time? That I'll triple check my locks? That I'll live in fear of every day things until I recover from your undeserved rage? How does it make you feel that as a petite female I already know I'm vulnerable and you just added 30 extra reasons for me to panic all time. 

And not to stereotype myself one way or another I was dress in a cream lace maxi dress and an adorable floppy hat. I might as well have been going to church. That doesn't really scream terrorist on sight to me...

You know what pisses me off the most is I probably hate extremist Muslims more than you. I'd line them up and punch them all in the mouth if I could. Their thinking is just so polluted with ideas of a religion they have turned on its head to perpetuate their stupid and ignorant ideas and to oppress people. Don't even get me started on those extremists that use the religion to oppress women. The evil things I want to do to them... 

Anyway Sir I got distracted thinking about religion and extremist and gender and all that good stuff. I want to let you know I don't hate you, I don't even not like you, I'm just fucking terrified of you. Thanks for that.

You made me feel like I did something wrong for just *existing* and that's the most unfair part. 

You should be ashamed of yourself and you know... although I didn't get a chance to say anything to you other than I was calling the police I wish I had told you the next time you yell at someone or pick a fight at least pick on someone your own size you jerk! You had at least a foot or a bit more on me and outweighed me by at least 100 pounds. What the hell is anyone supposed to do in that situation anyway? You could have kicked my ass and you probably could have killed me with fairly minimal effort. I hope that makes you feel good about yourself.

I hope this anxiety fades fast so I can move on with my life. I hope I succeed in doing all the incredible things I have set out to do in my life and you remain a disgusting blemish on otherwise generally wonderful humanity. I'm hoping someone snuffs out your ignorance with some enlightening knowledge, or something dramatic shakes your worldview. Or you get some terrible karma and at least spill some hot coffee on yourself. 

TL;DR: small female got called a terrorist for no reason, now have PTSD (edit: some anxiety)
 
EDIT: I don't actually have PTSD, probably just some mild anxiety. I got a little dramatic because this is off my chest? I thought PTSD was used to describe symptoms for a wide variety of things. Clearly was mistaken. I thought this was a safe place to whine and get things off my chest no matter now silly and minuscule or large and serious. I'm seriously sorry to those I offended. I was just ranting. 

For those of you that have offered support and suggestions on how to help deal and move on, you're all amazing. Seriously. Just getting it off my chest made me feel a bit better, but the support is really awesome and totally helping me feel much better much faster so seriously Thank you!

She wants to wear knee high socks with Jack Skelington on them, big whoop.  She doesn't want to cut her hair and grow it long, so what.  She brushes it, washes it and keeps up with it.  She is a gifted child, she makes straight As, and plays to instruments.  So YES I will put her in the gifted program. I am not worried about her not doing well or her feelings getting hurt if she makes a bad grade, tough that is life. She has made straight As and continued to do so oncei n the gifted program.

1369719068.0,432,self.offmychest,1f6mvk,"Girls dislike you not because they go for jerks and you're a nice guy, they dislike you because you're a needy, under confident loser who thinks that there is nothing more to dating other than being nice and chasing her 24/7.",iHeartCapitalism,660,228,163,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1f6mvk/girls_dislike_you_not_because_they_go_for_jerks/,"What better place to get this out than here. This has been said 93489238 times before, but I'll say it again in my own words. What I'm saying, to me and a lot of men is as common sense as water is wet. But some seem to be clueless about this.
 

 &amp;nbsp; 
 
Women don't like jerks. They don't like a man who slaps them (some enjoy it during sex though). They don't want a man who cheats on them and treats them like shit. 
 
 
 
&amp;nbsp; 
 

 They want a man that they feel they have to win over. And sadly, a lot of the men who give them that feeling are the ""wrong type"" (drug users, no future, lazy, etc.). 
 
 
 
 &amp;nbsp;
 
 
 If you're a nice guy who always goes after her, gives her flowers, always messages her, always show her that you're there for her and you'll wait for her. You'll come off as clingy and insecure. 
 

 
 &amp;nbsp; 
 
 Maybe women have a sense for this thing, but they can almost smell a man that's not confident. Whether you're short, a bit fat or not the best looking guy, it's not that which hurts you. It's not the fact that you're ""nice"" that hurts you, it's the fact that from 200m she can smell your lack of confidence. She knows you don't know how to make a woman want you. She knows that you're like a dog who is happy at every bone thrown at him. 
 
 
&amp;nbsp; 
 

 By treating dating a bit like a strategy game. By messaging her, but not too much. By giving her a hint that you're interested in taking things further, leave the door open for her to come to you instead of running towards her, she will love it. She wants to chase you. 
 
 
If you think that just being a nice and caring guy is enough, then you're basically treating her like a piece of meat. She's a human being and human beings tend to apreicate things a LOT more when we work for it. She will love you if she chases you, she will love the chase. **YOU** will love her chasing you. Show you're interested, of course, just never overdo it. 

 
 &amp;nbsp; 
 

And when she does chase you, control yourself, don't go all out.   Because if you do, then she knows she has you.
 
 
 &amp;nbsp; 
 

 
&amp;nbsp; 

 
4 things.
 
 **1st**: I have no problem with women even though I'm short (170cm). But my car doesn't even have a roof, just so I can fit my confidence inside of it. 
 I have no problems with dating. Women are easy to talk to, easy to make them smile, easy to ask them for a cup of coffee. If what I do works with most I try it on, but not all, then I must be doing something right. Women are just as easy as men. We're all humans, we're all ""easy"" if we are treated correctly unless if we're **really** not interested.
 
 &amp;nbsp; 
 
 
 
 **2nd**: Second, this applies to women. Dating is a mini-strategy game. If she's always the one chasing the man as well, unless the man is needy, she may push him off.
 
 
 
 &amp;nbsp; 
 

 
 **3rd**: If she doesn't chase you, then she never liked you in the first place. That's good, you didn't waste yours or hers time. 
 


 &amp;nbsp; 
 

 
 **4th**: Tell me that I'm wrong. Tell me that I'm an idiot, I'm a jerk, that my ego is too large, that i'm wrong, that I'm sexist. What do I care? I'm right. If you make a woman want you, don't give her the impression that she has you around her finger. 


 
 &amp;nbsp; 
 
 
Chase her (or him), but just enough so they can chase you back. 
 

 &amp;nbsp; 
  

 
**Call me a sexist idiot who see women as a piece of meat, as I'm sure some of you want to.**
 
 
I love women. I have a thing where I'm very weak for beauty and nothing is more beautiful than a woman (a Mercedes Benz comes close). I treat them with complete respect and never want just a one night stand. I simply came to the realization many years ago, that if I make them want me, I will have MUCH(!!!!) more success with them than if I was the one chasing them. Women are a LOT smarter than men at dating. Show her that you understand that.
 

 &amp;nbsp; 
  
&amp;nbsp; 
 
 
**tl;dr: Read the whole damn thing**
 
 Edit: This is not THE truth and it's not black and white. This is much like learning how to hit a nail with a hammer, if you do it the right way, more often than not, it will turn out Ok, but there are those times where it simply won't work and you'll miss and hit your finger instead.

You came up to us and told me that you needed to tell me something. Sure, why not. I could tell you were drunk but still, you could have had a medical issue that you needed someone to know about anyway.

You told me to come home with you tonight. I told you I wouldnât and that I wasnât interested. You then grabbed my shoulders and tried to kiss me, twice, even though I tried to pull you away.

The other first aiders came along, trying to get you away from me, but you kept ordering me to go home with you and the grand finale was when you tried to put your hand between my legs.

As first aiders on duty, we remained polite and respectful to you. We didnât even call the police even though some were standing less than 200 meters away. I wasnât scared of you, we outnumbered you 5 to 1, but that does not make your behaviour any less disgusting. 

Iâm more pissed of at you than I want to admit. 

If you canât control yourself when youâre drunk, you shouldnât drink. Simple as that. You'll destroy your life and possibly someone else's as well should it continue. I could have gotten you arrested and taken you to court for sexual harassment, so even if you don't care about other people, know that you could have ruined yourself yesterday and it wouldn't have been my fault.

I want to remember him; I want to talk about him. Pretending like he didnât exist doesnât work for me. I want to have pictures of him around, and not buried amongst all the other family photos.

I need to talk about him with someone; itâs driving me crazy I just want people to know about him. The problem is that sometimes it makes people feel uncomfortable talking about someone who died so young.


His name was Oliver; he died when he was 12. He was hit by a car, the driver never stopped â was never caught.


He liked cricket, his favourite meal was lasagne, he always chose vanilla over chocolate ice-cream, and he had blonde hair blue eyes and an ugly, yet endearing smile. He loved to draw, I still have some of his pictures, and he was really good. He wanted to be a doctor when he was older, he wanted to help people. He loved cats, he was scared of dogs but not of spiders. He hated brushing his hair, it was always a mess, but always brushed his teeth. He had lots of friends, he was so charismatic, I donât know how he managed it, everyone wanted to be his friend.

It's not okay to be atheist, gay, anything other than Christian, (and sometimes it's not okay to be anything other than Caucasian too). It sucks at times, but you learn to get by. 

Being gay myself, I usually share pro-gay pictures on Facebook (i.e. political cartoons, quotes, etc) just to try and persuade and show some of my Facebook friends that not all of us gays are demon-spawn. 

I'm a political science major in college, so I'm political at my very core and have found a group of friends in college that are ridiculously liberal and accepting, but I remember what it felt like growing up gay and alone in the middle of a small town of 900 people. Everyone knew you and rumors spread fast. 

But over the years, I started to come out (pun!) of my shell and start being more vocal about it (gay issues) on Facebook. At about age 16, that's when I started sharing the pride rainbow pictures, gay-related quotes, etc. 

Just yesterday, I got a message via Facebook from a kid that goes to my old high school. I don't know him very well, but he's four years younger than I am. I copied the message below:

&gt;""*i just wanted to thank you for what you do and say on here because it has really helped me a lot to understand things...i wish you all the luck with your new job and thank you for standing up for people like me*""

Now, this kid isn't out to anyone, and in the process of trying to de-sensitize everyone to the thought that gays are immoral creatures, I've lost several friends (both over Facebook and in real life), but with that message my heart swelled with pride. I felt like all those years of me being bitched at and cursed at had finally paid off. 

This morning, I checked that guy's facebook and he had shared a few pictures of his own -- pictures I have shared in the past. 

It makes me happy to know that I helped someone. Maybe I've even helped others that I don't know about? (Okay, getting cocky, but I'm all for helping people -- especially LGBT teens in the Bible Belt.)

I've been to the darkest, most disturbing depths of life; I've wanted to kill myself and end it all due to the pain that comes from being different in such a hostile environment, but I talked myself out of it. I talked myself down and made a promise -- that everything would eventually be okay. 

If I can just convince *one* person that, then I feel like my life has a purpose. And I did, and I'm going to continue to strive for better lives for everyone. 

I urge everyone to please, *please* try and be decent to the people you meet. I didn't mean to be preachy, but I know that there are kids out there that are just looking for some sort of guidance. Knowing that this kid had been following my pictures for god-only-knows how many years, thinking to himself, ""There's hope."" makes me smile. 

I'm happy that I was an example.

Today, I was awoken by the sweet, sweet sounds of ""Here comes the sun"" by The Beatles. 

For once I woke refreshed and feeling oddly free. Something was supposed to happen, I knew that. I wasn't sure what, but something. Usually, I spend the hour before work dreading leaving the house. I dread taking the bus, surrounded by people that scare me to death. I dread going to work, surrounded by people that might want to talk to me. I dread having to go out into the dark, cold world. 

But not today. Today was different. I had breakfast. I never have breakfast, I'm usually so terrified that I'm not able to eat. I almost hurried just to get outside. I smiled when I saw the snow. It snowed a lot last night, but I just thought it looked beautiful. Getting on the bus, I smiled at the bus driver. 

*Odd. I never smile. Especially not at strangers. I don't even look at them.*

I got to work, and almost bumped into a coworker. The one I've secretly had a crush on for at least two months. The one I don't even dare look at, because I don't want him to know. I smiled, and apologized. 

*What, did I just not only look at him, but actually speak to him?*

He looked surprised for a second. Then he gave me a really warm smile, and told me it was no problem. He was still in the way of the thing I had come to get, so I politely asked him to pass it to me. He picked it up, grinned, and threw it to me. A terrible throw, nearly unreachable. But miraculously, I caught it. Once again his eyes widened with surprise, and he asked me how I did that. Somehow, I felt compelled to actually answer. So I told him about how I used to play handball. He seemed interested.

*I just shared something personal about my past. There's something going on today.*

Now, I work at a daycare. No matter the weather, we spend at least 2 hours outside with the kids. This far up north, weather doesn't matter. We had quite few kids today, so there wasn't much to do. My male coworkers decided to race down a pretty steep hill on sleds. What the hell, I decided to join. It was so much fun. I laughed, I smiled, and the others looked at me with surprise, but rather pleased. 

*This is getting too weird. Why am I behaving as if I was a normal person?*

Frantically, I tried to remember what was supposed to happen today. It was something important. How could I forget? 

It stopped snowing, and the clouds cleared up. And over the mountain tops came something, something dearly missed and oddly surprising, and I felt the warmth of sunrays on my skin. 

A grin spread across my face. 

*Oh right. The polar night is over.*

But everyone in my group did things like, ""I'm short"" or ""I'm lactose intolerant."" But not me. I started dishing out heavy shit about my sexuality, and the interviewers looked shocked/appalled/startled.

I have never been so fucking embarrassed in my life, EVEN THOUGH THE DIRECTIONS TOLD US TO BE VERY PERSONAL.

I've finally gotten to a point in my life where I'm not totally ashamed of who I am, and the interviewers just shot all that down in a second.

I imagined him going to high school, getting his license, seeing him graduate from high school, going to college, dancing at his wedding, seeing him at my wedding. Even though he was my little brother, he always tried to protect me. He joked about hurting the next guy I dated if he ever hurt me. He thought laying down legos on the ground would suffice as revenge towards any guy. (Those damn things do hurt when walking barefoot though). He had a bubbly personality, was very charismatic for a 9 year old, and very stubborn. He was everything I could ask for in a brother. 

2 days before he died, I was at the hospital in the middle of reading him a bed time story when he took off his favorite blue dinosaur band and slipped it onto my wrist. I told him I couldn't take it since it was his favorite band. He said Mom told him that little things help us stay connected with each other forever. He pulled his sleeve up to show me he had another dinosaur band on his wrist. So when he wears his dinosaur band and when I wear mine, we'll always have this special connection only we can have.

The day he died, I sat by him holding his hand, waiting for him to leave us. When his breathing became soft, I whispered in his ear it was okay to let go. When everyone said their goodbyes, I leaned in and told him he was the best brother I ever had and that I loved him. Then I felt his grip loosen. 

I thought I was handling things better than I expected. Truth is, I've been on the go since he died so I haven't had the time to think about the funeral or eulogy or the bracelet or him. Now that I've had the entire day to myself, the grieving process has started. I haven't taken off the dinosaur band since that night at the hospital. It's the last thing he gave me.

I still remember that day in the hospital, when after fighting so hard, you couldn't fight any longer.  I was there, just you and me.

My hands can't even stay still as I type this. Even though it's been a year and just over 9 months since we lost you, even though I recently found an incredible woman that's crazy about me and that I've completely fallen for too... it's days like today I still have to let you go again.

Stereotypes.,ktthecosmicnerd,550,143,345,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1c22jm/fucking_stereotypes_fucking_stereotypes/,"Alright. I just had a days-long argument about the true meaning of feminism. I just read a horribly sad post about a young man who can't make friends because he's not ""masculine"" enough. 

First of all, there seems to be a lot of grumbling about feminism on Reddit and in the general webosphere. Everyone reading this should know that all the talk of ""rape culture/war on women/oppression"" comes from a very, very far extreme. If you hear/see/read someone spouting that crap, please tell them that they are taking a giant shit on the whole movement. I can tell you that I could give no fewer shits about being sexy, so I don't need some crazy feminista telling me that makeup ads harm my emotional well-being, or that men are oppressing me, or that men checking me out equates to marginalization. Firstly, as a young woman whose confidence originates from intellect and ability, the very idea of being that weak and stupid is insulting. Secondly, it perpetuates the idea that women are hyper-vulnerable. Really, we're not any more vulnerable than men are until someone(like society or a crazy feminista) convinces us otherwise. 

The point is, a real women's rights activist is not a bra-burning abortion rally groupie. She/he is an intelligent, cool-headed educator who has the knowledge to identify the real problems(like actual rape) and the understanding to separate them from the stupid shit(like ""rape culture."") 

Please recognize the bombastic rhetoric for what it is: pure, unadulterated man hating. Most of us love men. I know I do, and so do the rest of my feminist friends.  

Going further with the man love, it's a sad story when a young man is bullied for being gay when he's not even gay. For some reason, society wants us to think that the only ""real men"" are aggressive, domineering douchebags who don't acknowledge anything on a higher level than beer, tits, and video games. And the ones that show even a shred of sensitivity or emotional intellect might as well be raw meat in a piranha tank. We school our young men to be protectors and providers, and a lot fit right in, but a lot don't. We hear all these things about the sexual objectification of women, the social pressure to be sexy, the abundance of self-esteem issues that plague young women, and those things are real, but we hear nothing about the economic and emotional exploitation of men for success. I mean, the studies are out there. For example, it's been proven that men suffer from greater emotional duress during tough economic times. Suicide rates for men skyrocket, while they stay fairly level for women. The theory is that men suffer more because society heaps SO MUCH PRESSURE on them to succeed. But you know what? I didn't hear than on the news. I learned that in a college-level sociology class. Why is it that the cultural issues that harm women are so heavily publicized, but those that harm men are kept under wraps? Might it be the general cultural assumption that men are tough and they can handle it, but women are weak and need empowerment? 

It would be nice if someone would speak out against the exploitation of men in a way that doesn't use the phrase ""gold-digging whores."" It would also be nice if someone would speak out against the marginalization of women without pointing the finger solely at men. We're all responsible for our culture.

When I think of the word ""feminism"" my definition goes beyond the issues that women face. My definition encompasses any person, whether they have a penis, vagina, or something in between, who is sensitive and vulnerable and becomes marginalized because of it.

**EDIT:** This post is not in any way meant to degrade womens' rights. Women do face real obstacles. What I say when I say that rape culture/war on women/oppression comes from a very, very far extreme, I mean that there are some crazy ladies who think that all men are evil and they generally use this kind of language. Many of the problems are real, but they are being communicated incorrectly.

*   I can't walk down the stairs, jog, run, walk fast or jump without them bouncing around so much that it HURTS. 

*  Clothes don't fit me since they're first made for models who are basically all flat. Want a cute sun dress? Sorry, you'll look fat with the boobs pushing out the fabric from your body. Oh look! A cool dress that fist your whole body... exept for your boobs.

*  Finding a cute and fun bra is nearly impossible, and when I do find my size half the bra is **push up**!! Like I would need more of that! I have enough boob material allready!

* My nipples are huge. And I'm talking 5-6 cm in diameter. Plus, they are often very sore and tuching them hurts. People say that you can loose the sense of touch if you operate them as if that's a bad thing. It wold be a blessing!

* You know that wonderful feeling when you finally get som air underneath them to cool down the sweat? No? Well I only feel that wonderful breeze when I'm barely fitting them into my hands trying to push them up a little.
 
* I have a higher rate of getting breast cancer, luckily it doesn't run in my family. But you never know.
 
* I will have to deal with people in my workplace telling me that I'm dressing inappropriately even though I show no clevage at all.
 
* Men (and women) glare and stare. I feel guilty for having bouncing boobs that men look at when being around other women. And I get sad when I feel like I have to cover myself so that other women won't be mad and to prevent sexual harrassment.
 
* Natural big boobs are not firm, no matter what porn is telling you. They hang. You know, gravity and shit.

* You can enlarge yours as much as you want, but I can't make mine smaller without dealing with a long procedure of talking to doctors and what not.
 
* Want to hang out not wearing a bra? sorry, your perky, small wonderful breasts will have to hang by themselves becasue mine hurt if I let them hang free for too long. (about 1-2 minutes)

* I have constant neck and shoulderpains. It doesn't matter how much or often I get a massage, it will hurt again in a matter of minutes. As a result I have a lot of headaces.

* They make my already small head look tiny.
 
* And I feel so guilty for wanting to make them smaller because everyone tells me they're great and I should be happy about them.

The only good thing about them is that it's considerd ""sexy"" with large boobs. And that doesn't really cut it. I envy all of you A-B cups out there, hell even C! All I want is to look cute in a nice shirt and be able to run without having my boobs hurt.

So if you're sad that you have small boobs; at least you can lie on your stomach without it hurting like hell.

EDIT: I'm swedish, and 80 is the centimeter around my waist. I should wear a 75 but their C-cups are a lot smaller, and finding a 75E is not as easy as a 80D. I'm not even near being fat.

EDIT2: thanks for all the nice comments and helpful advice. I really just needed to vent my frustration (I was a the beach today and my friends were freaking out on me when I told them I wanted to make them smaller). I've been looking in to reduction for a while and am scertain I will do it, 80D might not look that big but it's heavy and bigger than you'd think.

I have Borderline Personality Disorder and also Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and I used to be on a myriad of medications. Pills for the BPD, pills for the OCD, pills for anxiety, pills for sleep. But of all my pills, I loved my (metaphorical) ""red"" pills more than my ""blue"". (""You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."") My vice? Ambien. I took one every night. Then, two every night. Then, one in the afternoon, one before going out drinking, and two more when I got home. Then I lost count. Then I was taking it with Ativan. Klonopin. Pills, pills, pills.

One morning at around 5AM, I woke up in the driver's seat of my car in a ditch, with no recollection of how I got there, or ever getting in my car in the first place. Did that stop me? Nope.

One night, I ""died"" in the ambulance on the way to a hospital after a friend found me passed out on my front porch, lit cigarette in hand. They put me in the hospital. Did that stop me? Nope. I faked it 'til they let me out, turned around, and started again.

I was cheating on my husband. I was cutting myself. I started randomly doing cocaine.

I was treating everyone I loved, and that loved me, like absolute shit.

What finally stopped me was almost losing my husband. The man that invested everything in me. That was holding on, trying so hard not to let me go, while I kicked and screamed and told him to rot in Hell... We ended up separated because he couldn't take watching me tear myself to shreds anymore. That man. That man saved me in so many ways. He saved me from myself*.

Two years ago this week, I turned a corner. I went to a counselor. I stopped taking all of my meds. She helped me get clean, and clean up my act.

I'm proud of myself... But I still miss how... Distant from myself I felt.

I'm the mother of a beautiful four month old baby boy now. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I wouldn't have him if I hadn't figured my shit out... But, today, I let my mind and negativity get the best of me. I had to hand him off to my husband and excuse myself for a while to take a bath because I suddenly hated myself. I was wishing I had my old life back. I would have killed for a handful of pills. I was losing my identity under the drool and spit up of the day... But... Then I reminded myself my identity wasn't that vapid, empty shell of a girl having sex with some random guy because he got her fucked up. That wasn't me either.

I don't have anyone to share this with, really. I mean, not in detail. A lot of people know I struggled with ""my meds"" but not to what extent. Bringing it up to my husband just reminds him of a very dark time in our lives. I just... Needed to share it with someone.

I'm not using a throwaway because I'm not ashamed. I'm a good wife now, and damn great mother. Sometimes I get a little overwhelmed, but now I have a cup of coffee and a hot shower instead of getting fucked up... That's something to be proud of. I'll take what I can get.

Dick.,reluctant_racist,517,120,309,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1b93ut/you_made_me_racist_dick/,"Not like it matters to any of you, but I am not a racist.  I grew up in a diverse hometown with wonderfully openminded, hippie parents who are in an interracial marriage themselves.  I'm a minority myself.  I can truly say that aside from acknowledging a few hilarious racial stereotypes, I judge people based on their character, and treat and view everyone of different races and cultures equally--it feels weird stating that because it's such a given.  

That said, I am a waitress and I have been for a long time.  I love my job, and I get to have all kinds of amazing interactions and experiences with people from all over the world, even if just for an hour.  But sometimes, people are huge assholes and I hate them.  And after working in the industry for so long, you learn to immediately know a good table from a bad table, just by looking at them.  Sometimes people surprise you.  But most of the time, they dont.

""Black people don't tip.""  I'm sorry, but everyone who's worked in a service industry has heard that.  Of course, that's not across the board.  And it's not just all black people, it's a certain breed of black people.  It's the kind of fucking black people that come in without smiling, in their oversized clothes (men) and undersized clothes (women), stomping to their tables, who interrupt you in the middle of a sentence to bark if ""ya'll got lemonade"".  The ones that treat me as if I am some kind of fucking burdensome gnat for encroaching on their special mealtime... I WORK here, asshole, this is my JOB.  Believe me, I don't WANT to serve you, I HAVE to.  YOU walked into MY place, remember?  Yes, we have lemonade.  No, we don't have wings.  Why?  Because it's a FUCKING SUSHI RESTAURANT.  Yes, yes, I see that upsets you.  What the fuck do you want me to do?  It's my fault we don't have wings.  Guess I don't get a fucking tip.  It's the kind of black people that suck their lemonades (why always lemonades?) down every 5 minutes, so I have to spend extra time away from my other tables, who WILL tip me, refilling those goddamn things without a thank you, without even fucking eye contact.  The same people who need lemons, and sauce, and ""ya'll got ketchup?"", and more napkins, and a hot glass for my fork, which can never all be in one trip, and nope, now the food is not good enough, send it back and redo it.  How hard is it to fucking smile at someone who is being nice to you?!  Is ""thank you"" not a thing to you assholes?  Grabbing at shit I put down, yelling at me and snapping their fingers from across the restaurant when I'm clearly helping someone else and WAS JUST THERE A SECOND AGO, and all that so you can ask me how much it costs for a drink.  The drink menu, labeled DRINK MENU, is right in front of you.  8 dollars?!?!?! Are you serious?  Go away now, servant lady, except I won't say anything, just wave my fucking hand at you like I'm shooing bad odor.

And now I've discounted your food because it had to be remade and you had to eat it after everyone else got theirs, and hell, I'll even discount your ghetto ass boyfriends food because it looks like he's pretty unhappy for some reason, too.  Now your bill is 3 dollars and some change.  You hand me 4 dollars, again, with no eye contact, and then keep sitting there like you aren't even ashamed of what a cheap asshole you are.  I FUCKING HATE YOU.  Do you realize that, in addition to having to tolerate your nasty attitude and your nonsensical, unnecessary requests for the past hour, now I have to actually take money out of my OWN pocket to pay for your fucking meal?  Not a lot, sure, but it's even less than just getting zero dollars.  Now, I've made negative dollars at work... and still, not even a thank you, a smile, or eye contact as a compromise.

I've always hated the word nigger.  I think it's a cruel, hateful word that has no place in the world.  Except now, I understand what it means.  You aren't a nigger because you're black.  You're a nigger because you're a rude, ignorant, uneducated, classless member of a group of people, doing nothing but giving truth to and perpetuating the same ugly stereotypes you complain about.  Not all black people are niggers, some of the people I love most are black people who are wonderful, kind people, and participate in society.  But you, you are a nigger.  And so is your boyfriend.  And your friends are likely to be as well, because self-respecting, nice people would never want to hang out with you.  And your kids probably will be, and you, and them, will be the ones to blame for the long life of racism.  You have created a racist out of someone who wasn't one before.  

Seriously, why the fuck don't you tip?  You think you deserve to fuck people over now because your grandfather got fucked over?  Is there some kind of annual nigger meeting that teaches you how to behave out in public to make people despise you, and then dare them to say something so now you can accuse them of racism?  I'm poor too, asshole, but if I don't have enough money to tip I go to the grocery store, or McDonald's, if I'm feeling particularly lazy.  God, I fucking hate you and one day, I won't depend on my job so much that I have to suck it up and be nice to you, and I'll tell you how I really fucking feel about you.

This all started when I first failed out of university the first time at 20. I rejoined university finished it and now have a job. May be, that is the only thing good going on in my life..a steady job. And may be being relatively fit and healthy with no diseases.

On my second stint at university, a girl I had a crush on - we were fooling around a bit. She touched my penis (4.5 x 4.5 inches). Just stopped  and turned her back against me and said she is sleepy. She did not do anything else. A little bit of 3rd base is all what I have done. After this girl, 2 more girls rejected me. I got them interested in me by talking to them and being genuine, but dick size is what killed it. I somehow managed to make them not notice my height or my hair(though I did have more hair then), but they could not look past my penis size. I understand, it is fair if they can only get off with bigger penises. It is their sexual preference. But telling everyone and me getting mocked at is just dagger in the heart and at the back.

As time goes on, I am seeing that I am inexperienced in relationships and sex. I am losing hair. I didn't think I was unattractive in high school, now I think I am because I am losing hair and just overall horrible life situation.

Even if I did get a girl to be interested and make her ignore my height or hair loss or even penis size, my inexperience in sex will make them run out of patience. I mean what girl wont get someone better than me.

I read on /r/sex about some girls saying that sexual technique is very important. But I got nothing. I am almost thinking of hiring a very expensive $1k/ hour escort.

I am going to die alone. Every night I sleep, I wish there was someone to hold me or me them. I want to make someone smile and laugh, but I can't get myself to laugh, other than my fake smile and laugh at work.

People may say don't worry about penis size or losing hair, but real life just does not work like that. There are probably guys out there who will say, they have a girl even though their situation was worse. But only a few people can be so lucky.


Life sucks, I can't even kill myself because I can't do that to my mother, father and my sister; especially my mother. I don't earn enough to go talk to a therapist either.

I just wanted to thank each and every one of you for making me feel better. I am sorry about all the swearing - I am usually a positive person, but everything has been building up lately, that I felt a rant would do me good. 





Disclaimer: I wear a fucking cochlear implant, so I can hear only when it is on. Also, I fucking say the word ""fucking"" a lot in this post.

I fucking hate being deaf. I fucking hate how for some stupid fucking reason, I lost my fucking hearing completely in high school at the age of 15, and the doctors don't fucking know why to this day. It's been 5 fucking years, and I turn fucking 21 in a few days. I lost out on my fucking teenage years...not going to the fucking prom, not being invited anywhere with friends because they all thought I was fucking weird and fucking made fun of me because of this fucking disability. 

And then, I fucking entered my freshman year of college...where I was fucking diagnosed with fucking Crohn's disease. So now I have to fucking worry about that and fucking ingest so many fucking pills each and every fucking day. But I guess those pills are a fucking godsend, since I am in remission and was able to fucking gain some weight and not look like I was anorexic anymore. 

I fucking hate how when there is a fucking girl that I like and I get along with and I fucking man up, apply a fucking steel coating to my balls, and ask her out on a fucking date, she says no and that we are better off as friends. Maybe it has to do with my fucking health problems, maybe it fucking doesn't. They don't fucking say. So I just shy away from girls, since I've had a lot of fucking bad experiences. 

For some reason, I was fucking lucky enough to have sex one time with this girl I really liked. She already fucking knew about my problems, but she said she ""liked me"" and she wasn't fucking getting along with her boyfriend. She fucking dumped him, and I waited a fucking month before asking her out...to which she fucking said yes. Things fucking escalated, and she took my fucking virginity. The next day...guess what? She fucking cheated on me...with her ex boyfriend.

A month later, her stupid fucking ex-boyfriend also somehow found out she had sex...which I'm guessing that stupid bitch told him but she denies it...and she started bashing me, saying I'm a fucking fat fuck with no abs. That I should have fucking abs like her ex- or should I say current- boyfriend and that my penis is too small. I fucking told her to get the fuck out of my life. That bitch knew I went up from 100 pounds to 160 due to fucking weight lifting...but I got a mixture of muscle and fat, which I am about to cut anyway after I finish my fucking bulk. 

Finally, I'm fucking tired of not being able to participate or hear my friends as much as I would like. I'm fucking tired of random people on my college campus coming up to me as if they fucking know me and asking what that ""thing"" is on my ear. I fucking end up feeling so self-conscious, and I tell them to fuck off, to which they start laughing. Seriously, I thought we were in fucking college, not high school. This has only happened with a couple people, so I guess I shouldn't fucking generalize.

Being vegan, she wants to keep within her moral lifestyle and not feed her cat any kind of foods that contribute to the death of other innocent creatures. Its diet consists of only water and cat biscuits. And the odd piece of stolen bread.

As a result her cat had relatively consistent diarrhea, and wasn't showing any signs of improvement. I started feeding it wet cat food and meat (that I buy for my cat) and now it's back to pooping like a normal cat. 

She's convinced it's because she changed brands of cat biscuits.

**Edit:** To clarify, the cat biscuits it does eat (when she feeds him) contain ""wholegrain cereals and/or cereal by-products. Meat and meat-by-products (poultry and/or beef and/or lamb). Cereal and/or vegetable proteins. Minerals, vitamins, and amino acids. Milk powder. Anti oxidants.""

I don't think housemate has actually read the ingredients in the cat biscuits we get, but it makes me feel slightly better knowing that it contains vital supplements that the cat requires, even if they're at a basic amount. I'm still going to continue feeding it wet cat food and meat anyhow, as it's definitely beneficial to his health.

I work as a student assistant for a chem class. The program is called Peer Assisted Learning. I plan to be a teacher, so this job is a dream. In it, I feel good. I feel useful and worth something. 

This is my second semester in the job, and it has brought some challenges. I had one student who would swear at me because I expected him to follow directions. He didn't respect me at all. Good thing, after I talked with him, he hasn't shown up since. 

We have evaluations twice during the semester (this is the first time since the program is still growing). The prof that reviewed me is my adviser and a fantastic mentor. This guy lives to teach people. He has shaped me a lot as a teacher. 

I was nervous during the observation (he sat at the back during a normal class session). When it was all done, we had a debrief to talk about things that were done well and things that could be improved upon.

Toward the end of the debrief, he lowered his voice and said to me ""Honestly, I'd rather have you teach some if this material than some of my colleagues."" 

That single comment made my entire month. To hear that from a person who has dedicated their life to teaching was amazing. I've had students tell me before that I'm skilled at what I do (not trying to be obnoxious), however, hearing that from him carried a lot of weight. 

If anyone is wondering, I decided to voice that here because although it's a very uplifting event for me, I can't share it with people without sounding really obnoxious and full of myself.

I cannot shed anymore tears. I cannot feel anything anymore. And worst of all, I can't see the one that I love most any longer.

Some things you need to know before you read on... My mother is an alcoholic, and my father was never anywhere to be seen.

It was as if it was just yesterday when Michelle and I met. It was our first day in Kindergarten, and I was a very shy one. Michelle noticed me sitting in the corner by myself playing with my Lego pieces and she asked if I would like to join her in playing with the marble set. You know, the marble contraption thing. I don't know what they're called. This was the moment where it all began. Michelle and myself... We quickly became best friends. I was very shy, so I didn't really have too many friends throughout school. Michelle was my one and only true friend. My best friend. We did everything together... All throughout elementary school. Whenever we were put into different classes Michelle would beg her parents to put her into my class.

I think it was around the seventh grade was when I realized that I loved this girl... So... I confessed my love for her. And luckily for me, she also loved me back. Things were great. We both shared our first kiss together in that moment. Later on in the year I gave her a very cheesy Valentine's day card, but I worked so hard on it... Trying to make it perfect. Things flew by pretty fast until the end of middle school.

And then it happened. Her father had received a job offer that had to make them move far away from me... I could not have been any more devastated. Michelle was pretty broken up about it as well... but we both knew that her father had to take the job.

We kept in touch through MSN messenger (yes, I know. It's old). At first everything was alright. We talked to eachother for what seemed like hours a day. As time went by... The time we spent talking to eachother grew shorter, and shorter until it was just a 'hey, how are you?' 'good, thanks, and you?' 'I'm fine.' And as even more time went by it was a weekly thing... Then eventually it stopped.

I became very depressed because I was always there waiting for her, but it seems as if she had her own life to live. She was always the outgoing one, while I was the shy one. I didn't have any friends in the years that preceded this... Michelle was my girlfriend, best friend, and my only friend.

Things became really heated between myself and my mother during this. It has always been bad because of her drinking, but it became especially worse since I started feeling depressed about Michelle. I yelled at my mother, and she yelled at me. Eventually, at the age of 17, I was kicked out of my house. I ended up roaming the streets with no money for a couple of days until a man came up to me and offered me lunch. He talked to me, asked me a few questions, etc etc. And then he called the government about me being a homeless 17 year old. I ended up being put in a foster home after that. It wasn't the greatest home, but at least I was in a shelter of some sort with food. This was when I decided that I needed a job. So I went around applying everywhere, and I was hired by McDonald's.

Still, with all of these things happening, I still went to school. I wasn't the best student, but I still tried. Balancing work, with school and my depression wasn't that easy. I ended up just barely graduating last year.

Now... I don't know about everywhere else in the world, but where I'm from you can't be kept in a foster home when you're 18 because legally you're an adult now. So I had to find a place to go. I had the money saved up from working, so I ended up going, can you guess? To the city that Michelle had moved to.

I ended up going to a library in the new city the first day I arrived and checked my e-mail, and to my surprise there were a lot of e-mails from Michelle there. I never checked before this time because of work and such, so I immediately shot her an e-mail saying that I was sorry, and had a lot of explaining to do, and is in her city now.

We ended up meeting up soon afterwards and I told her everything. Everything that has happened to me. She told me that the reason why she wasn't able to talk to me as much was because of the school, and work that she did. I understood. I... never lost my feelings for her... I don't think she did either. Because after I broke down in tears, she gave me a hug. A gentle hug. And we kissed. We ended up losing our virginity to eachother that night.

After that night, things became okay between Michelle and I. We were doing everything together again. She went to the local University for Chemistry while I just worked as a chef at a local restaurant trying to figure out what I wanted to do in life. For the first time in a long time, I felt happy again. Just to have Michelle back in my life.

Fast forward to three days ago... Michelle was supposed to spend the evening with me because I had my day off from work. Michelle had her classes in the morning, so we agreed that the evening would be ours. She said she would be there at 6PM... Minutes go by, and I'm thinking that she's probably just caught up in traffic... Then even more time goes by... I texted her, but there was no response. It was around 7PM when I had this gut wrenching feeling that something was terribly wrong. I called her cell phone, but nobody picked up. By now my heart was racing, and that knot in my stomach grew bigger. I tried once more, and somebody picked up and asked who I was. I told them that I was Michelle's boyfriend. It was then and there that I learned that Michelle was hit by a drunk driver on her way to see me, and was in critical condition in the hospital... I couldn't believe this. I couldn't keep my composure. I literally had a breakdown. I called her parents and told them of what happened, and then I rushed to the hospital. I screamed at everyone asking where Michelle was. I needed to see her. I wanted to see her. I had to see her. But I was told that I couldn't. That she was in the ER, and the doctors are trying to save her life. I had to sit in the waiting room. Waiting... hoping that she'll turn out okay... Her parents came a short time after I arrived, and her father did basically the same thing I did. Her mother was just in tears, and they both saw me sitting in the waiting room... in a wreck... and we all just held eachother hoping for the best...

Almost two hours had passed, and finally a doctor had come to talk to us... Michelle had passed away...

The news hit me so hard that I didn't even know how to react. Her mother bursted into tears, and the look of her father's face... Just heart broken... I felt the Earth beneath me move away. I felt the blood in me turn ice cold. I felt my heart just stop beating... And I started to cry. I've never cried so hard in my life. I've never felt such pain, or misery in my life... I couldn't even see Michelle after the news was given to us...

Michelle wasn't just the love of my life. She was my best friend, and my only friend. She was the one who I talked to about all of my problems. When we were kids up until high school, and then as a couple afterwards. She was my everything, and my everything is now gone.

It's been three days since this has happened. Three long, agonizing days. And I don't know how long I can last.

I love you, Michelle. You were everything to me.

She bought two other puppies this past summer, they were brothers and I puppysat one of them after work last time. Of course I fell in love over the course of two hours and let her know if she ever needed me to watch them, I would love to. She also said her husband wasnt too fond of dogs, so i made it very clear that i would take them in a heartbeat. Well I left that job in oct. and haven't had any contact with her except for the occasional 'like' on fb. So I saw the new puppy on her feed and thought that three dogs that young were something that she would suck at handling. I asked how the other two were doing with the new little one, and she said they got rid of one(the one I puppysat) for peeing on the floor. He wasn't even a fucking year old yet. Who gets rid of a puppy for peeing on the floor!? It's obvious she didn't fucking even try to train him. So she just scraps that one and gets a new puppy. It makes me absolutely sick. I don't know who she gave him to, but I could have given him a great life. She didn't want to give him to me at the time because her kids were attached. It's such fucking bullshit.

Now I'm telling the front page of the internet, and a bunch of strangers. My best friend, more like a brother ""Kris"", shot himself on Jan 16, 2006. Seven years have past, and I have literally told less people than the passing of the years since it happened.

I was a college student. A typical one. Drinking, partying, fucking, laughing, etc. I enjoyed that time both by myself, and with Kris. Kris was in a relationship with a girl that I didn't particularly care for, mainly because she treated him like dogshit, and I knew that he was a much better person than that. He and she had that annoying relationship, where they would breakup, get back together, breakup again. Annoying. The last time they broke up, it was serious. She had cheated on him. With me. I did it to show him that she was exactly what she was. If I only knew...

He and I had a minor falling out. By that, we didn't speak for about 4 days. He and I always had that relationship, no matter how pissed, it was better to fight it out, then get over it. That's what we did. Fought each other in his front yard with his mother, and the most wonderful woman I know ""Gloria"", watched us. When we were done (he won), she bandaged us up, gave us ice for the bruises and bumps, and fed us. 

Three weeks later, we were back to what we always were. Brothers. I should have seen, but I was blind to his ... inner demons. He was devastated, both because of my betrayal, as well as hers. I thought we were fine, but we obviously had issues that he internalized. A few nights later (Jan 16), I got a phone call from him. I answered as I normally do, ""What's up, bitch?"" and he responded, ""Brother ... I need you here now.""

Five minutes later (a normal 15 minute drive), I was in his mother's driveway, putting my key in the front door, hauling ass up the stairs to his bedroom. His voice ... something was horribly wrong.

I turned his doorknob, and opened it. I took a step in. He looked up from the barrel of the gun, saw it was me, and pulled the trigger. The back of his head exploded. A pink mist clouded the air, and bone fragments and brain matter exploded on the ceiling, wall, and the carpet behind him. His body crumpled. Boneless. My brother shot himself in front of me. Gloria screamed out his name from downstairs, hysteria already in her voice as she jetted up the stairs towards the door. I couldn't let my mother see my brother's body. I slammed the door shut, locked it, and pushed the bed in front of it and told her to call the Ambulance. Then began the clean-up. The body smelled horrible, he shit and pissed himself. I left it there, and instead, began picking up skull fragments, brain matter and covering his body with the sheet on his bed, all while emptying my stomach completely into his trashcan. The police and ambulance arrived, and escorted Gloria downstairs (I demanded that before they opened the door), and walked in. I was cuffed, and put in the back of the police car. Questioned at the office and after a few tests, it was found that I did not kill him, but in fact it was a suicide.

I have yet to see his tombstone. I haven't spoken to my brother in almost 7 years. In six days, I will see his final resting place for the first time. Gloria is meeting me there. I still talk to her every Wednesday after work.

I still haven't forgiven myself for what I did to him, and I still haven't stopped having nightmares where he gives me the guided tour of Hell. I likely have a circle all my own for the betrayal.

I'm sorry, Kris.

If you knew that, you'd laugh a little bit and tell me that you told me I'd like it someday, that I'm almost 22 now and my taste buds have changed since I was younger. Then we'd drink some together and talk about how our days have gone.

I remember being woken up by the smell of coffee every morning before school, and thinking it smelled so nice but always hating the way it tasted. I always tried it over and over again because you liked it so much and I wanted to be everything you were. You took your coffee with sugar, no cream, and you'd sip it slowly and close your eyes and smile, basking in the taste and smell. In the summertime, you'd make your own iced coffee and comment how it was so much cheaper than buying a cup at the drive-through.

I always associated coffee with you. You'd drink it in the morning to start your day. You'd go to a friend's house 'just for a quick cup of coffee' and you'd stay there talking for hours, and I'd be there with you and say, ""Can we GO now?"" because I was just a kid then, with a child's impatience.

When you were getting sicker, you wanted fewer and fewer things to eat and drink. You weren't really drinking coffee anymore, and I remember that was a sign to me that things weren't ever going to be the same. I remember telling you that I'd make you a cup, pleading with you to just accept my offer, thinking that smelling the familiar aroma and watching you enjoy a cup of brew would make everything normal. Just one cup, Mom. Maybe that's why you're so tired today... just a sip.

Now? Now I realize that cancer will take everything from you, no matter how simple and insignificant things seem... they're not immune to cancer's vice grip. Cancer took your appreciation for coffee away, along with your dignity, strength, coherence, independence, and ultimately your life. You were 57. You had many years left to savor cups of coffee in the morning. 
I was 19. I had many years ahead of me to buy you a cup at Dunkin Donuts and sip it with you out on the porch.

Cancer is an evil, slithering menace. I hate it...this bastard stupid fucking cancer that hardly anyone knows exists, and it was powerful enough to take my feisty, intelligent, independent, caring mother. 

I'll never forgive myself for going back to school to finish my finals while you were deteriorating in the hospital. I'll never forgive myself for giving the nurses the OK to give you more morphine even though you didn't want it, because I couldn't stand to see you writhing in pain or struggling for breath. I'll never forgive myself for crying by your bedside, fearful tears for the years I'd have ahead without you, because this likely made you sad and I just wanted you to be happy and okay. I'll never forgive myself for watching you lay there in your nursing home bed and just HOPING that tonight would be the night that you would finally pass away, because I couldn't deal with it anymore. I'll never forgive myself for being depressed every morning I woke up and you were still alive, because it was another day that I had to watch you get even worse. 
I'll never forgive myself. I carry this every day. I smell it in every whiff of coffee.

Now that you're gone, I realize that I'd give anything to sit at one of your friend's houses with you and listen to you talk about work and the weather and childhood memories for hours, even if it meant I was feeling bored. I'd give anything for just a few more minutes with you. I would give several years off my life to see you for even just a few moments, to let you know that I'm about to graduate college and lead a successful life, and that I miss you and I love you so much, and I can't thank you enough for being my mother and doing all that you did for me, and that even though I feel lost and empty just about 100% of the time, I'm pushing through it all because you'd want me to.

I'd give anything to sit down to a cup of coffee with you.

For those of you who don't know, that means I am a black person who doesn't act like a stereotypical gangster, Soul brother, or Jock.

The Term Oreo is more racist and offensive than the word nigger. Let me explain why.
The term nigger is a degrading classification of a type of  people. If you call me a nigger, there is some truth to that, historically speaking. Slave owners would call their black slaves niggers. 
The Term Oreo means that I am not acting like a media induced stereotypical black person, which is 100% OF THE TIME DEFINED AS sagging pants, loud and brute ignorance, pugnaciousness, being extremely disrespectful, and less educated. If you call anyone an Oreo, you promoting the fact that Black people act differently as a people than anybody else. I'll be the last person to disagree with you that black people growing up in what is called the ""Ghetto"" and more ""Hood"" parts of the United States act differently that a black person raised in the suburbs. I grew up in ""The Hood"" and I don't act like that, because my mother would have beat me to death had i acted like that. And I am not the only one.  Calling me an Oreo is essentially saying I am not Black. Excuse my rudeness for the moment when i say WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU TO TELL ME WHAT I AM?

You're not better than everyone else because you play D&amp;D, like Sci-Fi, or are a STEM major or a STEM major wannabe.  You're not better than recreational sports fans because you think your science enthusiasm is akin to actually knowing science. Newsflash, understanding the watered-down, generalized concepts behind a scientific theory is often *much* easier than understanding the math behind it (that you've probably never even looked at). You've never written or peer-reviewed a scientific paper. I don't see you ever formulating scientific theories or testing hypothesis. You may know more math than me, or gotten better grades, but I never see you doing anything other than using your college issued pieces of paper as a way to feel superior. Hey, why don't you shut the fuck up, and use your intelligence to actually do something? You unimaginative, stuck-up twat.

You're not better than a goddamned Twilight fan for pretending to like H.P. Lovecraft, just to keep up with all those insufferable Cthulhu memes and merchandise. Another newsflash, Lovecraft wrote about more than Cthulhu, and the table-top game of The Call of Cthulhu, to my knowledge, is quite different from his works, and the themes behind them. Besides which, there are other good horror writers, some of which you might enjoy if you ever picked up books other than just nerd-culture approved schlock like ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" book adaptations, ""Ender's Game"", and ""Ready Player One"". 

You're not cool because you like to insult art majors. Some work to live, others live to work, and money is not always what a person wants out of life. Let me tell you this, just because you consider yourself an intellectual doesn't make you one. Your philosophy isn't good, it's actually really terrible. While I consider myself a scientific realist, I can recognize that anti-realists can form very compelling arguments. Not that you'd ever know them, because with a name like ""scientific anti-realist"", the dogma-alarm is raised, and you either get super defensive and argue with fallacies, or go the route of the ponce and laugh it away, because you clearly know everything, prick. 

What gets me the most is the hypocricy. You're quick to jump in and point out how some jock is an idiot who is full of himself, but you think you're absolutely perfect. You find sports a waste of time, fine, but you then see absolutely nothing wrong with spending hours upon hours on a table-top RPG or some new video game I don't give a fuck about. You tout that people are more than labels, yet paradoxically uphold that nerds are ""awesome"", and that they're the ""chosen race"".

My dad's been a raging alcoholic for my whole life. To me, he was only emotionally abusive. He has anger issues and loved to belittle my sister and I, and when he drink he flies off the handle and sometimes would hurt my mom, never seriously but he would push her to the ground, grab her and pin her against the wall, etc. 

So, I'm 26 now, and I hadn't actually seen him act like this in a long time, at least since I had moved out at 18, but according to my sister he would still treat her and my mom like he always did.

On the Super Bowl, we had a big party and my sister's house with about 8 family members there, and my dad got obliterated when the 49ers lost. He was in a bad mood, and when he's in a bad mood, he likes to take it out on my mom. It started out as him just insulting her, that sort of thing. Everyone just tried to get him to relax, to no avail. After about an hour I hear my sister say ""Don't touch her!"" and I go into the living room to see my dad pinning my mom against the wall by her throat.

I was always afraid of my dad because of how mean he is, and the fact he's a lot bigger than me, and never really defied him, but after 26 years I knew it was time to do something. I grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around and told him to stop right the fuck now, and he grabbed me by my collar and started shoving me. I shoved back and he headbutted me in the mouth, and I lost my shit. I headbutted him back, and broke his nose bad, split it open. He looked stunned that I would do that, so I hit him 4 or 5 more times in the face until my cousin broke us up.

My uncles shoved my dad outside, I stayed inside to see if my mom was ok. After 15 minutes my dad came back in, and shoved through everyone to get to me. He shoved my mom against the wall HARD, right into a picture frame that broke and cut her. When he reached me I threw him to the ground, got on top of him, and hit him until his face was bloody and he was begging me to stop. After I stopped he grabbed me by the collar and screamed, ""Just kill me! Just fucking kill me!"" and the image of him bloody and beaten on the ground, screaming that at me still makes my stomach churn.

I know it wasn't my fault, and I was just doing what i had to do to protect my family, but I still feel terrible. It keeps me up at night still. When I think about my family members calling me and telling me that it wasn't my fault, I come pretty close to crying.

Sorry for any spelling mistakes, I don't even want to read over this again. 

I hardly even know where to start with this, I've never tried to talk about this in detail before. Maybe it'll help some.   

When I was younger, I had a whole stream of babysitters. My mum and dad worked full time, and were really picky with them because my mother worked in social services and had heard , and seen, all sorts of terrible shit happening to kids. Well, even through rigorous  interviews and background checks a few nasties still appeared. One of them would steal from our piggy banks, another fell asleep on the job all the time and we'd go hungry and another would scream at us for requesting the food our mum left for us because she didn't want to prepare it as she was a vegetarian. 
    
There were so many I can't picture their faces - just young, twentysomething blondes of varying heights. I can't even picture the worst one. All I know is that I was 6-8 years old, and she molested and raped me. A child, with no concept of clue of sex and she forced me. You hardly ever hear of female rapists. Rarer still are females who prey on little girls. I had no idea what to do - your parents would warn you not to talk to strangers, or about ""bad men"" - what about women who were meant to look after you? 
   
She allowed her boyfriend to abuse me - at least I think it was her boyfriend. It really could have been anyone, any sick bastard wanting to have sex with a child. When I cried or struggled they hit me, stuck me with pins so they;d only leave little marks and ,I remember this very clearly, pull out any wobbly baby teeth. 

I don't want to ever talk about this to my family, I feel ashamed and disgusting even thinking about it. I went to doctor once  when I was sixteen to get tested for any diseases, and shamefully said I'd been abused. The look of disgust on his face made it clear he didn't believe me. His advice was to ""Wear a condom next time"". 

I have no idea if my parents ever knew. So much of it is hazy, and blocked out. I'm glad only strangers will see this, I'm glad someone knows. 
   

   **EDIT:** Wow. I just want to say thank you for all the support. I didn't expect all these kind comments. Thank you all for the various bits of advice, I'm taking them into consideration. I can't promise I'll tell anyone, but I'll try.   
   
Some people have been upset about the incident with the doctor...I don't know what to tell you. When I went in for tests to assure I didn't have any diseases (I don't, thankfully) he asked my sexual history and I told him I'd been abused.

If she can figure out that something is trash and go throw it away, then *what the fuck is wrong with you*?  I'm the only one who seems to know how to operate the dishwasher, the washing machine, and the dryer.  I'm the only one that's capable of sweeping the floor or vaccuuming the carpet.  Heaven forbid if I ask you to help with any of it.  Oh no, that would cut into your precious internet time.  And somehow you still have the gall to ask me when dinner's going to be ready.  If you ever looked me in the eye anymore you'd see how badly I want to take that plate of food and throw it in your face.

What kills me the most is I know this is my doing.  You're spoiled and selfish and lazy and it's because I let you be that way.  I've bent over backwards and made concessions well outside of my comfort zone.  The mere fact that we're still married should be a testament to that.  Even after you cheated on me I forgave you.  Yet here you are again, taking advantage of me.  If it wasn't for our daughter I would leave because honestly, the sight of you right now makes me sick.

But you'll never know this.  You once remarked that I can keep face despite whatever shit is going down around me, didn't you?

I was having a fairly mediocre time at an All That Remains show (first concert I went to without friends) when she pushes her way next to me to get near the front before ATR took the stage. spilling my beer in the process.  She looked at me and apologized, and I hardly heard her because I was lost in her eyes.  She offered to buy me another beer after the show to make up for it, and we ended up at a bar.  We exchanged numbers at the bar, and went our separate ways.


We ended hanging out most days in the following week, and began dating a week after the concert.  Every moment I spent with her I learned something new about her, and quite a lot about myself as well.  Before her, I was just a failed musician (bassist) and computer nerd that had only ever had failed relationships.  She was different from the other women I had dated.  She was gorgeous, intelligent, had the same taste in music as me, and had the same dark sense of humor I had.  I couldn't believe I had found someone so perfect.  I could lose myself in her eyes, we could talk about various things for hours, and her smile made all the troubles in the world seem unimportant.  I often wondered what would have happened had I not gone to the concert, had picked a different place to stand, or had not bought that beer.


I was planning on proposing to her, and spending the rest of my life with her.


Anyways, we dated for roughly a year and a half, and lived together most days after six months.  Since I worked strange hours at the time, on days/nights I had to work I stayed with a friend who lived closer and worked with me so I wouldn't disturb her.  It was May 4th of this year.  I was at work troubleshooting some meaningless issue when I got a call from our roommate.  My love had hung herself with no explanation.  No suicide note, nothing.


I knew she had a rough childhood.  Looking back on it, the only thing I think I missed was that she had been slightly more affectionate in the week prior to her suicide.


Since she took her life I have not been whole.  People tell me I need to find someone else, but I can't.  I feel as if I died with her.  I have tried talking to women I find attractive (though none could be as captivating to me as she was) but I constantly compare them to her, and they could never be her equal in my heart.  I wake up even six months later and sometimes think she will still be there next to me.  I drink far more than I should, and sometimes all I do after work is come home and cry.


Maybe I'm overreacting like so many of my friends seem to think.  I've tried so hard to let go, but it's not that easy.  I still love her, and not a day goes by that I don't miss her.  Maybe I always will.",,False,,t5_2ranw,False,,,True,t3_15lz18,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15lz18/let_me_tell_you_about_the_woman_i_love/,

On reddit there seems to be a concensus (or at least majority opinion) that anal is the best thing since sliced bread, something that, if done right, will take you to new realms of sexual enjoyment.. and if you don't like it, you're probably doing it wrong.

I am a scientist. I apply the same overarching methodology in life that I do in the lab. This applies to things I don't like. I think it's BS when you say you don't like something after trying it once, and never try it again. I don't like bacon, but I try some every once in a while just to make sure. I don't like pork, but I still try it sometimes, and guess what? I **love** kalua pork. It's awesome. Thank goodness I gave kalua pork a chance, because I really like it. When I was growing up I didn't like shrimp. Now I love shrimp; it's just the way my mom prepared it when I was a kid that I didn't like.

When I got married we tried all sorts of things, including anal. I had read up on it beforehand so I knew to use lots of lube, start slow, do some finger play, douche if need be, etc etc etc. My wife and I have tried it probably a dozen times over the last 5 years. And we haven't liked it, neither of us, not once.

After the first time I thought, ""well that was underwhelming."" So we read up on it, asked around in some forums, and then we tried again with my newfound advice and ideas as to where things might have gone wrong. Still, I didn't like it. For me, it doesn't feel nearly as good as vaginal intercourse (probably because my wife is tight! tight! tight! as Tuco would say); for her, it didn't even feel sexual really. 

But after about a dozen tries at various times, with various advice, I've come to the conclusion that we don't enjoy it, and don't care to continue trying. It's not like there's anything missing in our sex life; to the contrary, I've been blessed with a wife who has no trouble climaxing both vaginally and clitorally, and of course I enjoy every bit of it. So I guess it was just curiousity, more than anything, that made us keep trying. But now we've stopped and I'm fine with that.

What bothers me, though, is how I constantly see on reddit (and sometimes overhear in conversation) this mentality that if you're not enjoying anal sex, you're doing it wrong. And if you're not doing anal sex, you're missing out. The fact that this mentality gets upvoted at all really annoys me. So much so, apparently, that I feel the need to get it off my chest.

Just to be clear, I've been vague about what we've actually tried in bed because I don't want advice about this, and if I told you what we tried, there'd undoubtedly be people coming out of the woodwork saying I did it wrong in some way. I didn't and we've already tried it, whatever ""it"" might be. Not everyone likes anal.

I'm not even joking.,DontLookAtMe_,407,43,180,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hkfgg/my_fatherinlaw_is_out_to_kill_me_im_not_even/,"I know it's normal for people to not exactly get along with the inlaws, but I am at my breaking point. I love my wife to death,  but I think I'm going to have to divorce her just so I can stay alive.

Her dad, or Satan as I like to call him, has done the following to me in the past 5 years:

1. Calls every night to speak with his daughter. Which is fine. But he always calls and insists on talking for at least 2 hours. He'll make her feel bad if she doesn't stay on the line. 

2. He calls whenever he knows we will be out doing something. We have learned to not tell him of our plans if we can help it.

3. He passively aggressively tells her how much I suck and how she could do better, *while I'm in the same damn room!*

4. He shows up at our house uninvited constantly.

5. When he's at our house, he's constantly telling me how I've done a shitty job on one thing or another.

6. He always 'accidentally' runs into me or hits me with objects. For example, when walking by, his cane will 'magically' hit my ankles.

7. The few times me and my wife have gotten into a fight, he has always tried to make things worse and plant the idea in her head that she should just dump me and save her losses.

8. He always acts sick and weak as shit when she's around, but when it's just me and him, suddenly he can walk, jog, sprint, lift 100+ lbs and talk and remember everything just fine.

9. When we were cleaning the gutters of his house, I was on the ladder and he was below me. He shook the ladder and nearly knocked me over, then claimed he had 'tripped'.

10. I was in the attic helping clean one time and he was below me again. He ended up 'accidentally' locking me in there.

11. Manipulates situations to where it looks like I'm being mean to a sick old man, when really I have been nothing but nice to this guy.

12. One time, I was in the attic again and he had 'accidentally' left the vacuum at the bottom step. I am positive he was just trying make getting down more annoying for me. Unfortunately, what ended up happening was I basically lost my ass virginity to Mr. Hoover. One of the worst pains of my life, and probably the only time I've ever seen him emit an emotion that was even halfway sympathetic towards me.

13. He's always introducing her to men he thinks would be better for her... while I'm right there! 

14. Whenever she starts to think he might be acting up, he pulls out the ""my wife is dead and I miss her so much"" card. Which I'm sure is true, there's no doubt in my mind that he loved her very much and misses her terribly, but still, to use her death as a way to divert attention away from his actions is shit.

15. I've caught him going through my phone, computer, mail, anything and everything whenever he thinks no one is around.

I know I'm not perfect, but this guy acts like I'm Hitler or something. I have a good job that pays well, I have never ever been mean to his daughter (seriously, I don't even yell when we argue, something a lot of people tend to do), I don't look at other women, I'm in shape and healthy, I don't drink or do drugs or even smoke ffs...I just don't know why he hates me so much.

My wife is smart, but her dad is very manipulative and continues to make it look like he's this sweet, frail and lonely old man that is just trying to be helpful and loving. I really don't think I can take much more of this.

He was talking about going hunting sometime this year, and I definitely don't want to do that. I seriously feel like he's going to 'accidentally' mistake me for a deer and shoot me dead about 20 times.

**tl;dr: my father-in-law is Satan and is trying to drag me to Hell when his daughter isn't looking.**

It's been driving me nuts. Today i knocked on his door to wish him a merry christmas and see how he's doing.. if he's even there. His door locks automatically so i can't just open it.

She had surgery and had to recover over the holidays. We arranged to meet in Kowloon (yes, I am a lonely Jew a long-ass way from home) for dinner.

She told me how she is now Christian because some guy prayed for her when she was in the waiting room before surgery. I'm agnostic, but I jokingly asked, ""what if he had been a Muslim, Buddhist, or Jew?"" She just casually said that she hated Jews, namely because her boss is an asshole who happens to be Jewish. So if her boss is Chinese or British or whatever, he's just an asshole, but if he's Jewish, then he's asshole *because* he's Jewish. 

I shrank into my chair. I didn't know what to say. I wanted to let her have it. My look gave it away. ""You're...not Jewish are you?"" To most people here in Hong Kong, I look like just another white guy. I just scowled at her. She immediately got defensive and apologetic and said she didn't mean it and that I was ""one of the good ones."" I told her plenty of Chinese people have been nasty to me, but that doesn't mean I dislike the other 1.3 billion of them. 

She tried to change the topic, but I just got up and left. The damage had been done. She sent me a message apologizing. I replied, ""assholes come from all races. Shame on you,"" and promptly deleted her.

I'm devastated. I really liked her. I had been looking forward to our date for over a month. I've been through a long string of rejections this past year, but this is hands down the worst. It's hard liking someone who hates you for nothing other than your race. A lot of people don't like the way I look, my height, or my personality, but I've never been so hurt over something I just can't control. I feel utterly worthless right now.

~~I'm reminded how most of the world hates me just because I am a Jew, even though I have never done anything to wrong them or even met them.~~ EDIT: that was kind of written in the heat of the moment. I feel better today and remember that lots of people, including Chinese, have explicitly told me *they like* Jews because of our many cultural similarities. I did some research and found that historically, China was one of the most tolerant to the Jews.

EDIT: I didn't realize how many anti-Semitic and troll comments I would receive here from a subreddit dedicated to just venting, especially when there's a little note before you post. It's great to know you think racism is no big deal and that I should suck it up.

We always made jokes that he touched little boys because of the history he had.  He had been in fights (and ultimately alienated) with several (3) of my dads friends because their kids claimed he touched them.  He had no wife and no kids.  He used to always try to be the best uncle.  He'd sneak us beers at 15, he'd take us to the movies, and always invite us over to his house.  His line was ""if you scratch my back I'll scratch yours""  We repeatedly joked about this to one another but no one would ever admit to them knowing if anything actually happened.  

Well it did to me.  He stayed the night at my parents house one night and wanted to sleep in the bed with me.  I was 13 at the time and the house was full of guest so I assumed this was normal.  He pulled the ""If you scratch my back I'll scratch yours"" line but I declined.  I rolled over and went to sleep.  I woke up later that night to him having his hands on my penis.  I panicked so I pretended to still be asleep.  He eventually went under the covers and proceeded to give me a oral sex.  I let him up until the point where I came.  Once I did, I ""woke up"" freaked out, and ran to the laundry room and locked myself in it.  He obviously followed and tried to talk me out of freaking out.  I called him many names and all he did was beg me not to tell my dad.  He said ""So are you going to tell your dad or should I just go ahead and kill myself.""  I told him he needed to leave and he did.

I never said anything to my dad about his brother sucking me off in my own bed.  I eventually forgave him and it was never spoken of again. 

Several years later he found out he had a son with a woman and they entered back into his life.  She also had another son which he accepted with open arms.  I never mentioned anything to anyone and only assumed that he had gotten better, that he wouldn't do this type of things to his own children.  I was wrong.  His kids did what I didn't have the courage to do, the spoke up.  He was sent to jail 6 months ago pending trial and he just received his sentence last week. He will spend the next 20 years in jail for child molestation.

I have a lot of regret for not speaking up.  I was not seriously affected by the situation but both of his sons are now in counseling.  I could have prevented it if I would have had the courage to speak up at 13.

I mean, at this point I'm used to the casual racism and misogyny, though it's annoying to see all the time, but what horrifies me the most is the complete lack of empathy so many Redditors seem to share. After seeing another news article about some 12-year-old girl who committed suicide due to bullying/cyberbullying, I should have known that the comments would be awful, but shit, I was hoping for a nice surprise and a bit of compassion.

Obviously, I was plainly mistaken, as the vast majority of people were shitting all over this poor girl and saying some awful victim-blaming bullshit. ""Oh she should've just stopped using the internet,"" ""Oh she's just a wuss, everyone get's bullied,"" and other shit to the same effect. Have you fuckers got no fucking empathy at all? Do you not understand that all people are different and that you'll never understand what was going through their mind when they made that choice, or how shitty they felt? Or perhaps that (in this case at least) they were 12 FUCKING YEARS OLD and obviously not capable of making a reasonable, informed and educated response to what they faced? I find it horrifying that so many of you people simply can't comprehend feeling a shred of remorse or empathy for another human being. Some of you people are truly fucking disgusting humans and I hope that one day you'll grow up and realize that there are a lot of underlying causes and reasons for the things people do, and that short blurbs or news articles are not enough context for you to make giant generalizations about people or judge them for their actions, especially when it comes to things such as suicide.

So that's some shit I felt needed to be expressed, and now I'm going to go drink some more whiskey and go hang out with my friends who aren't shitty fucking people.

I've been an overworked IT guy for four years, and I finally had enough a month ago.

I have four bosses. If I'm meant to be on one site, I'll have another boss phone me and demand I'm at another site in $impossible_time. I had to fix printers. Not just small ones, large digital presses that should have well trained operators. I was expected to be on call 24/7 and I can't remember a weekend in the last two years I didn't have multiple calls. I was expected to work overtime without pay. The whole company is expected to work phones, but everyone has an excuse not to. I could be up to my elbows changing drums and belts and get yelled at for not answering a call and 'owning the call'. In real terms this means I'd be working on a misbehaving press with an urgent job on it that absolutely must go out that afternoon with an angry print op, and angry customers demanding their jobs, and I'm being forced to take some fucking schoolkid's poster project order and explain the difference between coated and uncoated paper in a twenty minute call I must own. I'm expected to know pricing. I'm expected to be an impromptu sales rep.

I've been away sick two days in my entire employment. Because I'm single I was told in no uncertain terms was I to take holidays any time parents wanted to take holidays at the same time. I took three days off in 2010 and returned to a business in utter disarray. Nobody around me can problem solve.

Almost a month ago, I announced I was leaving and gave my notice. A week later I asked if I was required to train a replacement, and two bosses fobbed me off to another, who didn't accept my original quit date as she'd seen no evidence I'd quit. That's bullshit, I ran their fucking email. So I stated again and said I quit, and handed her my letter. OK, an extra week's notice, I can handle that.

The next closest boss to me panics after a week and realises just what he's losing and begs me to stay. I tell him I need things to change. I need an offsider, one who knows what they're doing. I need to not go near production presses. IT alone is more than a full time job and I need to devote my attention to it. Whether it's print ops getting training or more use of outside support, I don't care. That's another full time job and it needs qualified staff to do it. And I need to be off the constant run of customer facing phones. I tell him I want an employment contract with limits on my duties. I told him my notice stands and my last day would have been Wednesday July 3. He promises it all.

So I came to my last day (Yesterday) with no evidence anything was changing. It's in the pipeline, he tells me, and begs me back the next day (Today). I come in today and explain that my requests have to stand for me to stay. No phones. No constant on-call. Let me do the work I was employed to do without interference, without trying to do a single fifteen minute task and finding I'm being interrupted by customer calls, meeting requests, or getting a fucking book from a shelf in a manager's office 40 minutes away just to hand it to a staff member who works IN THE SAME DAMNED ROOM. I'm promised it'll all come.

11am and one of the other bosses tells me I'm needed on another site as their receptionist is off sick. Their. Fucking. Receptionist. We have sixty something employees and... Just no.

I said no, other boss got up my closest boss, and my closest boss tells me in no uncertain terms I have to go. Just for today.

So I reminded my boss where my documentation was kept for my replacement, and I walked.

at 11:15AM I walked to the cafe across the road, bought a coffee and a newspaper (I never buy newspapers) and read it from cover to cover. I read the advertisements. I ate a date cake and every single bite was sweetness. I talked to the staff about the 1990's.

I have enough savings to carry me for almost a year if I did nothing else about work. I think I'll take a couple weeks off and enjoy waking up after the sun rises.

I've had four calls tonight from work, two just while writing this post, and I've ignored them all. There are messages on my phone I'll probably delete unheard. Hell, I got home and relaxed so thoroughly I had the biggest dump in months, and that's normally a morning thing for me. Purging or some shit? Yeah. I feel so damned relieved.

**TL;DR I did all IT for my employer and had stupid interruptions taking up 85% of my time. I quit, was promised things would change if I came back, I came back and they broke their promises within three hours. I unceremoniously walked out and had a very big literal poo**

**Edit: Wow! What a response, I only hoped to have a few people read this to know I'd told someone how I felt so I wouldn't poison my IRL with how I felt. Thanks for the kind comments. And to the poster who told me I let them take advantage of me, well, yeah that was the point. My disappointment was as much with myself.

Or it was. Friday morning I got up later than normal but still got to see the sun rise. around ten I drove for a surprise visit to my sister's family. It was great to reconnect. Her husband has a couple of work leads I can follow up. Got back saturday night and spent today taking photos. This is great.

I didn't transcribe the calls (sorry guys, if I'd known there was a demand I'd have recorded/written the messages down), but I did listen to them all. Two calls were my direct boss who phoned and promised he'd get someone else in to help me. He'd said that a number of times before so I ignored him. Had another call friday afternoon from one of the decent guys who worked in design. Turns out he's got pressure on from boss 2 to service his own press and he has no idea how to. He's a smart guy, and one of the good kind people. He could do it and I could have told him where to start, but then it'd never end for him. Instead I said I can only be contacted by boss 2 (more about him coming up) about doing any work for them - but reminded him of our conversations about being expected to work more and more. He got the idea, and I pointed him to the guys we actually have a service contract with for those machines. Of course, they cost more...

Boss 2 I call ""Doctor So"" in my head. He's probably the most painful and inept guy I've dealt with in management. He phoned more times than I could count, and I eventually phoned back to remind him I don't work for the company any more but I'd be willing to come in and diagnose problems for $insane_price + $hourly_rate. I know I could walk away from it all and have no contact, but I have this little core that wants a bit of justice and wants them to do things right - so I let him know what my time to deal with their shit was truly worth (no way he'd pay it, been there long enough to know).

He tells me straight up ""Employees don't get to set their pay, so...."". 

That's his way of ending a sentence and letting people under him fill in their own presumption about what to do next, by going ""I don't think this, so..."". I got the ""We've got a lot to get through before we can start on $upcoming_work, So..."" and ""You're not being fair, so..."" and ""This isn't what we'd worked out, so..."" (we hadn't worked ANYTHING out whatsover). I couldn't really respond any more, but after I ended the call I wished I'd said ""Well I'm just not working for you any more, so...""

Last call was from fourth boss, the one who didn't accept my original quit submission. She kind of floored me, she wished me well and wanted to verify what my direct boss had told her about me leaving. She'd heard a bit of a twisted version about that, but I cleared that up. We had a chat about how shit it was there, and if she's telling the truth a lot of it comes from the owners. They're her family and she feels stuck in her job working for them too.

A little kindness goes a long way with me even if it's far too late for me to come back, so I sent her an email last night repeating more of the info about where I'd left documentation, what I knew I ended up responsible for and would soon fall apart, and what I thought needed to change ASAP. I wished her well too. Feels like I tied ends up a little less burnt-bridge style than three days ago.**",,False,,t5_2ranw,1373175158.0,,,True,t3_1hmk0g,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hmk0g/i_quit_my_job_today_i_know_it_leaves_my_old/,

It is objectively more expensive. My wife and I just broke into a 5 figure combined salary a few months ago. We're just now to the point where we can regularly buy meat and vegetables; for a long time it was macaroni and cheese, rice, pasta, and potatoes for nearly every meal.

I'm sick of being effectively told that if you aren't rich enough to afford an all organic, gluten free, GMO free diet, then you are a filthy person who is eating yourself straight into a grave.

I hope you all the best in life, it's definitely worth living.

EDIT: Woah! When I first posted this I did not expect this many upvotes, let alone so many encouraging comments. A lot of you asked for the full story, so I must deliver.

I'm a 16 year old living in Ontario, Canada. I'm currently a junior in highschool. In my sophomore year I met the girl in my dreams. She was a student from England that recently moved here. She was freakin' gorgeous, I'm talking about a 10/10, blonde, big brown eyes, long wavy hair, and I don't even want to call her ""hot"" because I feel that word is thrown around so much it would be unfitting for her. She was beautiful. When I first saw her I didn't think about it much cause I figured it was just my hormones getting the better of me and that she was just a very, very pretty girl. After a month or so, we had a few mutual friends and I talked to her and it quickly escalated from us being distant acquaintances to friends to close friends and eventually best friends by the end of the school semester. In that time, I not only found out more about her, but myself as well. I remember around 5 months in I was laying on my bed and texting her and I realized that she was something special. I personally don't believe in soul mates but it just felt so different this time. Her and I shared the same sense of humour and she was absolutely hilarious. I loved making her laugh and tried to do it as often as I could just cause I loved see her smile. She made me such a better person and when I was with her it felt like as if all my problems in the world were gone. It seemed that time was endless and I just felt so complete. Of course I also realized that love is a two-way street and I accepted it. I accepted that she might not like me back and I would have to be content with being nothing more than her friend my whole life. But it didn't really matter, as long as I could make her laugh it was fine with me. She would often tell me what male celebrities she found hot and asked me on guy advice, and it put a dent in my world, but I accepted it and gave her my best sincere advice cause I was still her best friend, regardless of what I felt, and I wanted her to be happy. This carried on until December last year, she told me she was moving back to England because of family-related issues. Needless to say, my world was crushed, whatever chance I had with this girl was now gone. She'd be leaving in a few weeks and I felt like as if I was just watching the best thing to ever happen to my life slowly disappear. We agreed to keep in touch but I doubted that we would, cause you know, she was absolutely amazing and she really had no reason to keep in touch with a relatively uninteresting person like myself. She left on the 28th and I just became mentally lost. She sent me a text after her flight and we texted back and forth for about an hour before she went to bed. I told myself I'd give it a week before she'd just stop talking to me, but I was wrong. We texted each other all day long for about a week and yesterday she just suddenly sent me ""I need to tell you I'm in love with you."" When I saw the text it was a mix of emotions, from confused to being shocked to being absolutely ecstatic. Which lead to this post. I am still texting her as I'm writing this. You may call me young and naive and tell me I don't know a thing about real love yet, and you very well may be right, but I've never been happier in my life and I'll settle for that.",,False,,t5_2ranw,1357682502.0,,,True,t3_165tpw,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/165tpw/the_best_feeling_in_the_world/,

My WORST delivery ever (so far)


This guy ordered about 75 dollars worth of pizza, and he is a first time customer as well, so we're a little wary of the order. I am the unlucky one that has to deliver it (I'd rather it be me of course than any other of my co-workers)


Anyways I digress,
I get to the house and the guy is sitting on the porch, he sees me and immediately gets up and walks over to my car and hands me this beat up gift card with numbers that OBVIOUSLY don't match the card number on the receipt. So I tell him politely ""Well this card doesn't match the receipt"" and he says ""Well of course this is a gift card."" So right then and there I knew he wasn't going to pay for his pizza. Then he looks at me, and says ""Well my Old Lady already left"" and I told him again, very politely, ""Well I'm sorry sir, I cannot give you the pizza if you don't have the card and an ID."" He then proceeds to flip his shit and start pacing angrily around me saying how it is bullshit, that he's a regular customer (Which he isn't by the way because it was an order from a number we never got.) At this point, his kids, that were sitting across the street begin to look, (2 little girls about the age of 6, and 2 sons that look like they were in their early teens) sitting there as their father is ranting and raving and cussing me out because he can't pay for a pizza and is now trying to con me out of a pizza because he's probably too lazy to get a job, or is just some jackass that doesn't want to get a job and continues to leech off welfare. I don't know his story, nor will I care as much as I would if I didn't know him.


Again, I digress.
He threatens to call my manager, so I go ahead and hand him my phone and even dial the number for him, he then proceeds to bitch out my supervisor because he's a supposed regular (again, he isn't, first time customer) and demands a refund because the person that bought the pizza isn't there (or existed in the first place.) So his wife, girlfriend, sister, I don't know walks out and offers to pay for the pizza with a 100 dollar bill which I don't have change for so I take the money and said I will go to the store (which is like a 2 minute drive away) and come back with change. She says okay that's fine, but can we have the pizza first? I was VERY suspicious of the 100 dollar bill, it didn't feel right and it was crisp, so I told her no she can't BUT what I can do is give you the receipt which ENTITLES her to the pizza so I HAVE to come back, because it's my JOB. She then changes her face and says ""Oh well if that's the case then we need to get the pizza for free"" and then I take literally 2 steps back, and the husband/jerkoff walks up to me and says ""Hold on a fucking minute don't you try to run off with my money"" (I only took 2 steps back) and I said ""Sir I'm just trying not to lose my job, I WILL come back I gave you the receipt) and he says ""You have my fucking money right there, now give me my fucking pizza before its cold"" and then, before I take another step I said
""Sir, Lemme just make ONE phone call, to tell my supervisor that you're going to pay by cash""

So he gets pissed off again, starts calling me ""fat sack of shit"" and whatnot, flips me off repeatedly walking in front of me (at this point I'm doing my best to not grab his middle finger and just snap it backwards.) He gets in my face, grabs me, and rips the money out of my hand and the receipt. Tells me to fuck off and shove the pizza up my ass, which by the way sounds really uncomfortable. Then he tells me to get out, even though we're outside, before he kicks my ass. Then he threatens to post all over my company's facebook about how shitty I supposedly treated him. Sadly, people like that will get their way because they know how to work the system.

EDIT: 
It seems I forgot to mention that, it wasn't paid through the same card.
The card number, or I assume it would be I didn't take the order, was a debit or credit card. So the guy tried to hand me a gift card to make it seem like it was his card. 
Also I know I could have handled the situation a bit better according to some people. I appreciate your guy's advice and will try to follow. 
Oh! Forgot to mention. I'm not sure if he was having a rough day, or if he was under the influence or whatever. I shouldn't have been so judgmental.

AAAAAAAAA!!!  THEN SHE WASN'T DEPRESSED!!!!  And stop saying what depressed people ""can't"" do that can make them better.

Guess what?  I know you *think* you're doing the right thing, and I genuinely think it's wonderful you want to advocate for people with mental illness.  **BUT STOP**.  You are NOT helping.  In fact, you are disempowering yourself, every person with depression, the caregivers who love them, and the professionals from doing what they can to help.

Well a cardiologist doesn't have to know what a heart attack is like but they can treat it.  A person doesn't have to know what losing a child is like but can still offer psychotherapy/counseling/support.

In NO OTHER MEDICAL FIELD would you be allowed to say that.

""Hey!  Stop telling them what to do.  They should not have chemo until several million readers on reddit understand what having cancer is *like*.""

The depression circlejerk can't go on forever.  And let me be clear - it is VITAL that people experiencing depression (stop saying 'suffering depression' too btw, that's not helping) be able to express themselves and make sense of their experiences.

BUT all you other people whose fingers are trembling above your keyboards, *aching* for someone to utter a thought about a change of thinking style, a change in activity, a new philosophy of life, a visit to a health professional - something that could (and scientifically DOES) help people with depression.

I feel like there is always going to be this moment, that this latest thing is going to be the breaking point and now, finally, I'm free to live life like all of the people I see just going about it normally.

It's been three years since my high school sweetheart committed suicide by hanging himself at UW-Madison.  He broke up with me a few months before (I assume as an attempt to ""save me"" from the emotional carnage) and had happily moved on to a thinner, younger, prettier version of me.

I didn't have time to grieve. 

Only six months later my then current boyfriend was killed in a car accident that I was also involved in.  We were moving in together. We were just driving to Target to get some clothes hangers. 

It wasn't fucking fair. I was 20 years old and two people who I loved to death were, well, dead.

People expected me to move on. After all, I wasn't even dating the first guy at the time (even though we had a three year relationship prior to the breakup) and I'd only been dating the second guy a little under a year.  I was expected to be okay when the cuts healed and the bruises were gone. I was whole on the outside, shouldn't I have had enough time to heal on the inside.

When I didn't people thought I was being selfish. My mother made me move out and go back to college, sick of watching me mop around the house.  I used it as an escape from the feeling, but a year later I dropped out after having a nervous breakdown.

I tried drugs, alcohol, counseling, grief groups, everything. I was terrified of getting over it. I was terrified of putting a punctuation mark in my story with them.  I denied that it was over.  I still, three years later, have dreams that they are alive and I see them and run to them and touch their face and tell them I love them.

At this point I can't hold down a job.  Even without these two major deaths I am still recovering from a childhood of physical and sexual abuse from my father and a mother who thought it was best to play the trophy and keep out of it.  I barely eat, I haven't shopped for groceries in over two months, I wear the same three outfits because I can't drive to Goodwill for more, I cry when I think about the prospect of sleeping, I can't even be the passenger in a car without bursting into tears.

My only happiness is my little rescue dog, Seamus.  He has been my rock. If it weren't for daily walks with him, taking him to the vet, grooming, dog park, and various parks and recreational activities I would have laid down next to their graves and died.  But now I can barely even afford to keep him.  Student loans take up all of the money I have and I will probably be moving at the end of the month, maybe into some kind of projects or government assisted housing.

I'm scared. I'm alone. Seamus is sleeping on the other side of the bed and has no idea. I'd kill myself before I had to give him up but even the prospect of dying and leaving him alone is too much for me.

My first house wasn't a house. I grew up in a small trailer until I was around 7 and my parents could afford a real house. My mom worked two jobs until I was about 10 just so she could afford a decent house for us to live in. My dad watched me and my brother every night while she worked the graveyard shift at Walmart. 
We always lived in the same town. I went to the same lower-class public school for 18 years. I graduated valedictorian in a class of only 35 other students. I was bullied as a kid because I wanted to go to college and make something of myself. It was my way out.
But college took money; money my parents didn't have. I broke their hearts knowing they couldn't send any of their kids to college (I'm the oldest of 3). So I worked. 

My first job was at a poor dog shelter. I worked there for $5/hr feeding dogs, giving them water, and shovelling their shit during one of the hottest summers on record. I threw up several time, but worked through it. I got heat stroke once. On my days off, I'd take free college-level classes at the local community college. I got laid off.
My next job was at some horse stables. I again cleaned up shit for less than min wage and worked more hours than I'd be paid. I was sick for a month during this job, coughing so much that I'd throw up in the snow. I was again laid off.
My last job was this past summer. I worked at a lumber yard, stacking heavy boards in another of the hottest summers in state history. I worked from 0700-1600 each day while taking more classes. 
All in all, I earned about $5,000. It was something I was proud of; something I could look at and say ""I earned that with blood, sweat, and yes, vomit."" 
Then I get to the University of Illinois. I join the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps to cover my tuition. My parents were so proud and so was I. I still am. I would be the first of my family to get a college education from start to finish without interruption in decades.
Then I tell a few guys this on the first week of classes. I tell them where I'm from and how I don't have much money. I tell them my ACT scores, GPA, major, etc. We were all sharing. They just laughed in my face and asked how I even got into this school.

This is to you fucking upper-class, elitish bastard children who look down on us with less. I've done pretty goddamn well considering where I come from and what I come from. I am a fucking Army cadet. I wake up and run until I puke at 0600 for four days a week while you complain about a fucking 10:00 class. I don't get to go out late. Mommy and Daddy aren't paying for my education. They can't. They're too busy trying to save up for my siblings to go. I fucking hate people like you. What the hell gives you the right to look down on me?
You complain about how hard it was being a lifeguard throughout high school. I puked in the sun, shovelled dog shit, and I didn't complain one fucking time! I sat through my crappy public school education, watched pompous snobs like you get a head start, and didn't complain one...fucking...time. Mommy and Daddy won't help you in the real world. For your sake I hope they do. But you wouldn't last a day in my life. I've seen shit that would make you crawl back to mommy begging for her to take you back home. My town has been kicked by the rest of the state for years, but we still get through. My mom got fucking laid off because of pompous shits like you seeing what's going on and deciding that we're not worth your time. I will be better than you.

A redditor commenting on another topic mentioned the idea of ""you can't have a *type* when it comes to dating, unless you've dated that 'type'.  And then dated other 'types'.  Only then can you truly say what you are into.""

And I couldn't agree more with her (the redditor was a woman).  And it made me go ""Huh, maybe I've got to broaden my horizons, expand my universe, not be so superficial.""  And so I dated a fat woman.

She was ok personality-wise.  Could have been more interesting, if I'm being honest.  But after we had sex at one point she got out of bed to get something and bent over.

Jesus Christ, I'm normally the most unassertive, reserved, ""hey, we're all different"" type of man, (hence why I'm posting here), and I am a feminist, but when she bent over EVERYTHING in my body just went, ""NO.  NO.  FUCK THIS.  I'M OUT.""

And I really feel like I learned an important lesson about attraction.

Through grade school she had a couple friends but they've always seemed to move or they were just kinda fleeting.  But she had a best friend, Mandy.  She even lives up the street.  Going into middle school, Mandy ventured off into her own direction and she and my daughter, Allison kinda drifted apart.  I think going into middle school really showed Mandy how different Allison is since she's autistic.  They still said hi in the halls and sometimes partnered in classes, and walked home together after school.  But most of the time Allison was alone at school.  It was hard work trying to appear normal and keep up, even with the help of an IEP.   
This year, 7th grade, she met Rose.  Rose and she did everything together at school.  Rose knew Allison has autism and didn't care.  She said many times that she has Allison's back.  My God, Allison blossomed this year.  They hung out and it was SO normal.  I felt so good, so proud of my daughter for the strides she made. 
Well, a new girl came to their school a couple months ago.  Rose and Allison welcomed her into their little circle. It was great.  The I noticed Rose wasn't calling anymore.  When Allison called her, there was never an answer.  Rose started getting snappy with Allison.  And now it's come that she and the new girl, Haley, have completely shut my daughter out.  The two of them have also been hanging out with Allison's old friend Mandy, and all of a sudden, Mandy stopped walking home with her after school. 
My daughter is so confused as to why her best friend ditched her.  There was no fight or anything.  She just says that Rose likes Haley better and she wishes she knew what she did wrong. 
My heart is broken for her.  My heart wants to protect her and just shield her from this kind of hurt.  But I can't do that.  I can try and soothe her hurt feelings and keep her busy having fun on the weekends but I can't interfere with her personal relationships.  
She is such a sweet girl.  She's just a little...quirky.

He is 36 years old and has never slept with a woman before. 

Sounds weird? Well, he has struggled with schizophrenia for most of his adult life and his condition made him quite sociophobic. It's been getting better the past few years, but he's still not very confident around people. 

Although there have been some opportunities to sleep with other women before, he never went through with it, partly because he was too nervous and shy, party because of his phimosis (as it would have hurt too much). He never saw the need to fix this problem until recently, though. 

He had a circumcision surgery about 3 weeks ago and he just came back from the doc a few hourse ago who allowed him/us to have sex because everything is healing well. :)

Why am I telling you this? Well, there seems to be social stigma attached to older male virgins, so I wouldn't want to talk about it with friends. But at least I can share my joy with you guys on Reddit that I can finally sleep with my new boyfriend! :-D

... hm, and this may sound silly, but I'm kinda afraid that he will not like it as much as I hope him to like it... :-/ 

I'm usually quite confident sexually (happy with my body, orgasm and squirting frequently, properly experienced etc.), and we've tried lots of exciting and new stuff in the past 4 months, and we talk A LOT about everything - but still I'm worried that maybe he won't be into boring old penis-in-vagina-penetration. Silly thoughts, I know. He assures me that everything will be fine, though. ;)

Thanks for listening, Reddit. Just needed to get this off my chest. :)

// Update: We haven't done it yet. Too nervous, too little time, too many uncomfortable thoughts running through his head. We talked about it, decided to leave it at that for tonight and give it a try another time, and simply switched to oral. ;) We'll get there eventually.

Despite this, if you posted that without a disclaimer saying as such, without fail you will get some dipshit telling you that's wrong because his mom is taller than his dad as if that somehow proves your general statement untrue. 

No, fucker, it doesn't. You're just a pedantic little asshole who's really bad at reading comprehension. 

Reddit seems to have a pathological aversion to acknowledging the fact that sometimes *Group A* is mostly *X* or or *Group B* is usually more *Y* or whatever, no matter how blindingly obviously true it is. They'll obsessively point out the exceptions as if that somehow makes it not *generally true.*

Is there a name for this argumentative fallacy? Because if not, there really should be so that when people use it to try and deflect an argument they don't like it can be pointed out and they can be suitably ridiculed for it. 

What is it? Does reddit just desperately want to believe in the special snowflake status of every single human being so badly that they can't see that you can still speak in general terms about groups?

Hell, I guarantee one of you fuckers is about to pull this shit on me for generalizing about reddit when you're proving the goddamn generalization right by opening your stupid mouth.

I haven't finished college yet. I haven't studied Anthropology, Psychology, or any other subject that would make me a modern day expert on race relations. I can't tell you how things got this way. I can tell you that I wake up black every morning. I can tell you how my day might be a little bit different from yours. I want to tell you that I know what you think of me, and what I think of you for thinking that.

**You think I don't tip.**
This one bothers me so much. Mainly because I did not know that you thought that before I came on reddit. So, thanks for that. I always tip. Or atleast I used to. After I became aware of this stereotype I watched a little closer. My white friends got more attention, better service, bigger smiles from servers. I did not leave a tip that night. Why, you may ask? Because you didn't think I would and I know how much you hate being wrong. You now have further affirmation of your prejudices, and I saved a few bucks. Win-win.

**You think I'm loud**
I'm actually a pretty damn quiet person. No bother, I'll go on my way and you'll anxiously wait for me to bust out in my baby daddy drama. You'll later forget about me (a quiet black person) in favor of confirmation bias and a story about a loud black women you saw three months ago in Target.

**You think I'm ugly**
*Black women have a masculine appearance. Black women are unattractive. Their skin is too dark. Their nose is too wide. They're all fat.* That's fine. Honestly a preference is a preference. I tend to prefer men in my own race or of Mexican descent. I think the way that your veins stick out through your skin makes you look like you're close too death, and the way your skin burns looks like an infectious rash. I probably could have left that out. Note the difference between preferences and rudeness. 

**You think I'm stupid**
This one makes me laugh. I recently graduated as valedictorian of my high school class with a 3.94 GPA and a 29 ACT. I am by no means a genius. I am also far from ignorant. I let this one slide. It's not my job to prove myself to the person checking me out at the grocery store, selling me my movie tickets, or even fixing my broken arm.

**You think I'm living off of Welfare**
I am not affluent. I'm also not on Welfare. I don't receive food stamps. I don't think there is anything wrong with receiving government benefits. I think one of the signs of a modern society is the lack of people dying of starvation or diphtheria in the streets. Fuck me, right? I worked at a grocery store for a year (shocking, huh?). My favorite thing ever was when people (always white) would tell me how Mexicans were lazy and blacks needed to help themselves and then they would pay in food stamps or WIC and I would carry out the groceries to a brand new Chrysler. 

**You think I steal**
This one really hurts. I have never stolen one damn thing my entire life. The first time I realized that I was being followed around a store I was 14 and with my *white* friends. When they noticed they laughed and made jokes. I went home and cried. Now when I notice I'm being followed in a store (and only when I notice) I purposely do really shady stuff. I cut my eyes from a product to the door and make a show of looking for the security cameras. Take your thrills where you can.

**You won't accept that there are more than two types of black people**
Currently there is a video on the front page of reddit of a black man giving his opinions on the Trayvon Martin case. That video inspired this post. I did not follow the case. I don't know the first thing about it. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say neither do you. You read the first comment on any thread about it and sagely nodded your head before walking away feeling better about yourself for being so aware. In your mind the people he is talking about are poor ignorant niggers. He is a *black person*. How many times in my life have I heard the old niggers vs. black people argument? Here's a hint. If you use it, you're racist. This video is a prime example. OP found a random video of a *black person* giving a 3 minute ~~hate filled rant~~ college level dissertation of the state of black culture in North America while in a parking lot. In OP's mind this man was a *black person*. He agreed with OP's prejudices. He used racial slurs *that obviously can't be that bad because a black person said them*. But most importantly he gave those *niggers* some damn fine advice. You won't accept that there isn't just black people and niggers. There is Stephanie and Marcus and Rachel. They're all a little different. You'll never accept that though. That's cool.

**You think I have something to prove to you**
My whole life I have been a model student. High grades, no discipline problems, and plenty of community service. I get a pretty damn descent academic scholarship to the best school in my state. I have a loving and supportive family. You want a black person to show how we can be well-adjusted and valuable members of society. Fuck you. I don't have to prove one damn thing to you. I am not the magic negro. It is not my job to take lost and ignorant souls and give up my time to broaden their horizons. Be racist. **I. DON'T. GIVE. A FUCK.**

How the fuck am I a rapist?,Anothergoddamthrway,380,81,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1eqlm1/we_didnt_even_have_sex_how_the_fuck_am_i_a_rapist/,"A couple of weeks ago, I went out drinking with friends for the first time since my separation from my wife. It was just supposed to be me and a couple of close friends who thought a little karaoke would help me blow off some steam, but one of them invited another friend, a woman I barely knew. I'll call her Julie. She was quiet, nervous, and a little awkward. I had met her once at a party, and the only things I remembered about her was how she never said much of anything. My friend said she thought Julie might chicken out and not come because she was kind of shy. She was a little late, but she did show.

The night had been going pretty good. We drank, sang like shit, and spent half the night laughing at ourselves. Julie stayed pretty quiet at first. She laughed at our jokes and clapped after every song, but didn't have much to say for a while. After a couple of drinks she got more open, started talking more, and eventually picked out a song to sing. Instead of focusing on the friend she came with though she kept talking more to me until her song came up.    

Most of my friends left early. By last call, it was just me, Julie, and our friend. They had rides, but I didn't. Julie said I could share her taxi, or I could go home with her. I wasn't thinking too clearly by that time. I should have just gone home, but home was an apartment with barely any furniture and I am still not used to being alone there even after 4 months. I am sorry, but that's just so fucking miserable and depressing, and for the first time in months I was feeling pretty happy. I made the bad decision to go back to Julie's place.

She offered me another beer after we got back to her place, and we sat around listening to music and talking. I remember having another beer, and another, and at some point she started kissing me. I was a little uncomfortable with it, but I shoved it down. My marriage was on the rocks a while before I moved out, and it isn't like it's going to get better, and it had been a long time since I felt like I was wanted. I guess I was just lonely, and Julie was pretty hot. 

One thing lead to another, and Julie pulled me on top of her, and we ended up trying to fuck on her couch. I felt like a douche. I was so drunk I was fumbling everything, and Julie was frustrated. Also, even though my wife is leaving for another guy, and she has been horrible, and I know it's over, I felt like I was cheating. I couldn't do it. After a few minutes of trying, I pushed away from her and told her I was sorry, that I couldn't go through with it. She said she understood, but she must not have because she leaned down and tried to blow me to get me hard again, and she thought I was playing and grabbed my hands when I tried to keep her off of me. I don't know if it was because I was drunk or because she was holding my hands down, but that just creeped me the fuck out. I couldn't make her understand that I wasn't into it anymore. I couldn't push her away without hurting her, so I moved backward a little at a time until I fell off of the couch. I grabbed my clothes and started getting dressed. When she saw my face and realized I was upset, she got pissed and started yelling and crying and hitting me, and kicked me out of her apartment.    
    
I don't know how long I wandered around outside. I wasn't very aware of myself or my surroundings and I know I fell down a couple of times. Somehow I ended up at a gas station. The cashier there called one of my friends for me, and he came get me. Other then thanking him, I didn't talk the whole ride home. When he asked if I was okay, I told him I was just drunk and tired. I didn't say anything else, and I was glad he didn't ask. I didn't want to talk about it. I just wanted to forget about it. 

Now, I can't. I got a call from the friend who invited Julie. She says Julie has told all of her friends what happened that night, and another of their friends is saying that because Julie was drinking that night, that us trying to have sex means I raped her. I told my friend that's impossible. I didn't start anything, Julie did. I didn't try anything with her. She came on to me and when I tried to stop, she didn't stop. I didn't do anything to her.     
    
Now my friends are questioning me and turning against me, and God help me if this gets back to my wife before the divorce.

On your 35 birthday you went out ""golfing"", but ended up going to another women's house, you cheated AGAIN. But this time you were in serious shit, you started to slur you words, you lost control of your body, you had a stroke. We waited hours for you to come back from your ""golfing"" session. You came back 4 months later, crippled, useless, and broken. 

Mom, my brother and I helped you to walk, talk, drive, eat and every other basic thing you need to survive. After gaining the ability of your motor functions back, you sat on your ass for 2 years, making everyone wait on you hand and foot

Finally you start looking for a job, everything starting to look up, we have a car, a house, your working, everything is ok. All of a sudden mom is diagnosed with cancer, its curable, but it still takes a toll on the family. While she is going through chemotherapy and radiation, what are you doing? Fucking another women, after all she has done for you.

Mom beats cancer, you and her fight still, but everything is going ok for now. You both start working, you bringing in more money then mom but its ok. 

Mom loses her job, we are struggling finically, she looks every where for a job, and you criticize her for being lazy and not working. You open up a separate bank account and keep all your money to yourself, making the family struggle 

FINALLY everything is staring to look up again, after a wild roller-coaster of events we seem to be settling down and everything is ok, but again another twist of events. You son has leukemia, this time we are not sure if he is going to survive, mom is devastated, I am distraught, my brother is fighting for his life, and what are you doing? Finding another mistress.

This time I have had it, you have ruined this family enough, you are stealing money from my brothers donation account to spend on your girlfriend. Mom can't leave you cause we need your money to get good care for my brother. But me? I don't need you, as a matter of fact, I don't want anything to do with you.

He flew in on Friday and will be here for a while. Despite all the times we've Skyped and sent pics to each other, there was always the fear that once he met me, he wouldn't find me attractive anymore. I've been very overweight since I was a child. I'd never had a boyfriend or kissed a boy. This is a contrast to my boyfriend who is tall and skinny, has been with his fair share of girls, and lost his virginity pretty young. So I guess to say I was afraid he'd change his mind about me is putting it lightly.

But here I am now. Today is his sixth day here, and it couldn't be more perfect. He never stops talking about how sexy he thinks I am. He never stops touching me. The first time we had sex, on the first day, it's like something changed in me. I'm not self-conscious around him anymore. I feel a thousand times better about myself, which is the single most important thing this relationship has given me. I don't think I've ever been this happy. Before we had sex, being a 21 year old virgin seemed like the most embarrassing thing in the world.

Before then I thought I was simply fat, and that when I lost all that fat, that I would be beautiful and valuable. When I was twelve I lost two stone, and realised I was simply, irretrievably, ugly. My most prominent feature is my long, hooked, nose. My eyes are tiny and so close together I can only use children's glasses. I am twenty one and still constantly get large, red spots. My hair is a thick, brown mess of frizz. I have a wide ribcage and broad hips, which leave me with a very broad figure no matter how much weight I lose. I have very small breasts, which, coupled with my wide hips leave me perpetually pear-shaped. To top it all off I am tall, 5' 10"" in stocking feet, so there is never an option of blending into the crowd. I am always seen, and always ugly.

The world of an ugly woman is different to that of a beautiful woman in so many ways I could not begin to explain it all. I can, however, briefly sketch the strange differences I have observed between how society treats ugly women, and how society treats beautiful women.

My sister is beautiful. I have many beautiful friends. I live in the same world as beautiful women. I am not one of them. They are celebrated, remembered, asked after. People are good to beautiful women, even when beautiful women are indifferent, hostile or even cruel in return. People remember my sister's name and instantly forget me. When we are introduced to new people together, nine times out of ten if I meet that person again they will immediately ask where my sister is, how she is, what she is doing. I am never asked about myself and she is never asked about me. My beautiful friends are photographed by friends and acquaintances. I am silently left out of the records of social events. I am erased from history because I am too ugly to be photographed. Strangers compliment my sister and my friends, strangers insult and ridicule me.

Men might think that perhaps they live in the same world that I do, but they don't. Even ugly men live in a different world to me. I have never seen, or heard of, a man experiencing the same level of public condemnation for their looks that I have faced. The most recent example I can think of is the man who stopped in the street last week to tell me that I shouldn't be wearing tinsel on my head like my friends (we were going for Christmas drinks) because I was so ugly. This is not rare for me and this is not new. This has been my life since I was a young teenager. When I see discussions about catcalling I want to scream at the people who tell women that they should be complimented. What should I do when someone yells at me, unprovoked, that I am an ugly minger? I know I am ugly. There is literally nothing I can do about it. I'm trying my best already!

There is hope for ugly men in popular culture. We celebrate the story of the ugly, or at least not conventionally attractive male, who finally gets his, inevitably beautiful, female crush to realise how much he is worth on the inside and how worthy he is of her love. That story never happens in reverse. There are just no famous actresses that are anything other than conventionally beautiful. 

Nobody writes books about ugly women. No one makes films or plays, or songs or art of any sort about ugly women. In fact, we're not there at all. In popular culture, and culture stretching back as far as human memory goes, ugly women are not there. We don't exist and nobody talks about us. Beautiful women are the only women we see or hear about, and most crushingly, the only women we remember. The ugly ones, no matter what they do, seem to be simply invisible. Invisible or evil and bad.

We shouldn't be surprised by this, though, we tell children stories of the good, beautiful princess and the evil, ugly witch. We make this happen.

When I tell people that I, *surprise*, don't actually hate my home, my state, or my country, they usually just respond by saying that I don't ""know"" better and it's just because I was born there. Apart from the incredible patronization, I *do* know better. As to the second point? Well, *yeah*, people tend to have a fondness for where they were born. People like what is familiar. I guess I missed the point where that is some sort of crime. However, what bothers me still is that by saying I don't actually hate any of the aforementioned things, I am somehow, in these peoples's minds, agreeing to a host of bizarre things. No, I don't agree with everything the government does (at the munincipal, state, or federal level). No, I *do* have a lot of problems with certain aspects of the culture and politics of my region. And no, I'm not going to be embarassed because sometimes my very slight accent isn't posh enough for you. 

While I typically don't engage it, every time I've tried to argue with people on Reddit (and sadly, even in real life), that no, in fact, the USA is not a police state banana republic, I get shouted down with cries of DAE SCANDINAVIA?? The utter obliviousness is palpable. For some reason, anything but agreeing with that sentiment means I believe that America is devoid of any problems whatsoever. Of course it isn't. We have *many* problems. And I'm sure Scandinavian countries have their problems as well. However, I have to wonder why it is acceptable to constantly shove their shrill, ultra-nationalistic claims down my throat without even an inkling of self-awareness, and yet if I so much as say anything other than the American South is some sort of 3rd world hellholle, I am a brainwashed, insular patriot? I'm of the opinion that we, as Americans, have something to learn from nearly every country, and every culture on the planet. Yet, with all our faults, we also have our strengths.

1370293622.0,296,self.offmychest,1fluhc,The wrong person died.,tkmac69,332,36,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fluhc/the_wrong_person_died/,"My family was incredibly happy. My mother and father were financially secure, unaware that in a year they would both lose their jobs and never get them back; unaware that their son was about to die.

My big brother was my best friend on this planet. He was also very likely autistic. He was quiet and shy, but an immensely talented artist. His reserved and soft nature appealed to me, an awkward, acne-covered middle schooler. He was eight years my senior, a former high school goth who was bullied his whole life. He had a profound passion for video games, and I would watch him play for hours at a time. He was the most gifted and talented gamer I've ever witnessed. 

Scott struggled socially, and found solace in three things: video games, girls, and drugs. Incredibly witty and charming one-on-one, he was a social outcast. He would bring in girls like sick puppies and try to ""fix"" them; nine times out of ten they were mentally ill and would only take advantage of him. 

One such girl was Christine. Christine was a wandering drug addict who only dated Scott so she could stay in our house and use his money for drugs. She got him hooked on heroin with her. Eventually, Scott got tired of the drug life and wanted to break things off. She knew this and intentionally got pregnant so that he would stay with her.

Whilst pregnant, she continued to mooch off of us. She smoked marijuana and used heroin regularly. Finally my nephew, Cillian, was born. He was addicted to heroin and went through massive withdrawals, spending the first weeks of his life in the NICU. 

Seeing as his parents were drug addicts, my family assumed guardianship of Cillian. His parents were not capable and Christine came from a known home of abuse. Her family is psychotic. The mother regularly spied on us, peeking through our windows at night and slashing our tires, leaving voicemails threatening our lives, calling the police on my father alleging that he was a heroin dealer and my mother was a prostitute, etc. She also bragged about hiring a hitman to murder to my family. 

We kept Cillian and Scott and Christine lived in the house until he was about a year and a half old. Then everything changed. 

Scott and Christine went on a heroin binge in an apartment and they both overdosed. Scott was on the couch and Christine was on the floor. When Scott passed out, he slouched forward. When Christine passed out, she fell back. Scott died. Christine didn't. The police told us it was very likely Christine murdered him, as his alcohol levels were too high to be conscious, let alone overdose on drugs; but there was not enough evidence to pursue charges, despite the fact that her first words coming out of a coma were, ""I killed Scott.""

My family fell apart. 14 year old me assumed the responsibility, along with my parents, of raising an infant without parents. We spent the next five years in courtrooms fighting for Cillian, spending over $50,000 on court fees. How it took so long for us to become his legal guardians baffles the mind; at the time his mother was suing us, she was in jail for prostitution and cocaine possession. The only other possible guardians on her side of the family were her parents, known abusers who fed Cillian beer during some of their few visitations. Her mother wasn't even allowed in the courtroom after she cussed out the judge. Still, five painful years later, we finally achieved full custody. Christine is still turning tricks for money, despite having another child and being confined to a wheelchair from her many drug overdoses. 

Here's the fucked up part: We've spent our life savings fighting lawsuits from this family for five years. Five years we have been raising an orphan; his mother is nonexistent. She is required to pay zero child support and is not required to visit him, and she doesn't. She speaks to him maybe once a year. Cillian's handmade Christmas presents are still sitting by our front door, waiting to get picked up. As far as his little six-year-old mind is concerned, he doesn't have a mother. She essentially forgot he existed. This is after giving him special needs he probably wouldn't have been born with if she was a responsible or decent fucking human. 

She stole my brother's life; her son's life; my family's lives... and she continues to walk around, a free woman suffering no consequences whatsoever for any of her actions.

He does not remember his father. He will never know his father. He does not know what he looks like or the sound of his voice. He does not know his father's memories or his father's laughter. He does not know his father's embrace; the embrace of the kindest, most gentle, incredible human being I have ever had the honor to know. 

My mother lost her faith in God, wondering how a God-loving, ardent Christian like herself could be dealt such horrible cards after doing everything right; wondering how the wrong person died.

My nephew is an orphan. But he is the only thing left that reminds me of my brother. I will never, ever stop loving him.

Also, this is going to be pretty long so sorry. 

I was seeing a local band this weekend and it was pretty small showing in a hall a little outside of town. I told all my friends I was going home and went outside to wait for a taxi on my own. I'd been sitting down for two minutes when this man who'd been smoking outside starting whistling at me and catcalling. I just ignored him because while unwanted, that kind of behaviour isn't the worst thing in the world and I didn't want to miss my taxi.

Suddenly the same dude was behind me and as I stood up he grabbed my shoulder to hold me in place and started whispering in my ear, asking me if I'd like to go back to his place. I tried to say no and I mentioned my age but he just ignored me and kept begging me. I kept trying to pull myself away but he was so much stronger than me. He started kissing me and feeling me up and I just kind of froze and I couldn't say or do anything and I tried to push him away but I couldn't.

He then picked me up and took me back to his car and he kept trying to pull off my clothes and he kept begging me to give him head and I know I should have started screaming but I just couldn't do anything but cry and wish I wasn't there. He fingered me for a while and he kept trying to get me to give him head but after figuring out that I wouldn't he just pushed me down into the dirt and went back inside to the concert. I stood up and waited for my taxi a little longer and went home. I've been trying to go about as though it never happened, but every moment since then all I can do is relive it in my head. I feel so unsafe now and I can't do anything but sleep and I feel unclean in the way that showers don't fix. 

I hadn't told anyone until today. A friend of mine asked me why I'd taken two days off school and why I was so down and I asked him if I could tell him anything in the world without him judging me. He said yes and so I told. All he'd said about it is that I should be grateful that I wasn't kidnapped and murdered and that I should have been more careful and that all I can do know is forget it happened. 

I just feel sick. I need support and I know this is really petty and stupid because so many people go through worse things but I don't know what to do. I'm trying so hard to just move on and forget it happened but I can't because it's like it's just an ongoing event and I just feel so stupid because there's so many things I could have done to save myself from this and then this isn't even a big deal anyway so I feel stupid and like a huge drama queen for making such a big deal out of nothing.

None of my photos were past PG-13 but it still felt incredibly naughty and exciting to post such sensitive material on such a public page. 
My first post actually made it to the top 20, and I received A LOT of messages from men. A mix of nice guys who just ask how you're doing all the way to guys who just send pictures of their dicks to you. I'd never had so many guys telling me how hot I was and how much they liked my pictures. I just felt so.. wanted.
I messaged back a few guys, and after a couple more posts in the upcoming days, agreed to Skype somebody. He was really cute and thought I was gorgeous, but after a few minutes of play, he wanted to see me get naked. I got uncomfortable but tried to relax and took off my shirt. After a few more minutes, I told him I was sorry and signed off. I didn't even know what was wrong or why I was so upset, but I just couldn't do it. It felt so far out of my comfort zone that I broke down into tears as he continued to message me asking me to turn the video back on. 
I felt badly for him. It's pretty obvious what a guy wants when you post there and he messages you to talk. I just didn't expect to react how I did. 
So I guess I'm just not a gonewild kind of girl. Being on it felt both amazing and dirty and sexy all at once, and it was just too much for me.

And I can't handle it. 

For the past 3 weeks, the pressure has pushed me to the breaking point. I have panic disorder that I take medication for, and the week before spring break I had two panic attacks. 

I'm in all AP and honours classes, and I'm also stage managing our high school musical. Everyone takes the musical way too seriously, and it adds an immense amount of pressure. Lately, we've been staying until 7pm. I have seven siblings at home who I have to help take care of. Getting home at 8, I have to eat dinner, shower, help out with the kids, and I can't get around to homework until 11. 

So, my grades have been steadily slipping to the failing point, I'm not sleeping well, my panic attacks are flaring, and people are heated about the musical. Over spring break, I cut myself after being straight for almost 4 years. I was ashamed of myself, and I couldn't tell my best friend. I've been keeping up a pretty strong exterior, but today I kind of snapped.

In theatre class, my teacher cornered me about stage managing responsibilities, and all the homework I have overdo and all the stress at home hit me, and I just froze. I just stood there nodding at him until the bell rang. I went to the bathroom, broke down, and then went to lunch.

Then, tonight at rehearsal, my theatre teacher called me out of the auditorium, and he basically just told me he knew what was up. I explained to him that I was stressed, and he said that he understood. He brought up that he remembered me trying to tell him before that I couldn't handle the position, but he didn't listen, and he apologised for it. It's just nice that he thought about it. He then proceeded to say I could continue helping out if I'd like, but I wasn't obligated, and if my home life got too hectic, I could come stay after during rehearsal just to get homework done. 

It was just nice that he noticed, and it helped a lot. I just needed to get my immense gratitude towards him out somewhere, and I can't tell my best friend about it, yet. She'd be crushed. I'm just glad he took it into his hands to help me out, even though it's definitely not his fault.

*EDIT: Thank you everyone for the kind words (and some not so kind). I really appreciate it. To clarify, I take Zoloft for panic disorder, not stress. For those telling me that ""real life"" is going to hit me in the face if I don't woman the fuck up: I know. I know life is hard at times, but this time I got a bit overwhelmed and slipped up a bit. However, thanks to people who care about me, I got through it, and I'm sure I'll still have people who care about me later in life. I didn't come here to bitch about my stress (although I'm sorry if it came across like that, I was just trying to share the back-story), I came to share with the internet how much I love my awesome theatre teacher.

Also, I don't hold anything against my best friend. She has her own problems, and I put up a good front. We talked about it, and she while she was crushed at the fact that I relapsed, she's glad I finally came to her.

I woke up to someone's hand in my window touching me.

I got off work about midnight last night.  My fiance worked this morning, so he was already upstairs in our bedroom.  I went upstairs and we talked for a little bit about our day.  He needed to sleep, but I was still wound up from work, so I went downstairs to surf the web and watch some tv.

I must have dozed off on the couch.  I woke up to someone half-through my window with his hand touching something only my fiance is allowed to touch.

I screamed.

He ran.

I only saw him for a few seconds, my mind still cloudy from sleep, awaking into an environment that can't be real.  But it was real.  The window's up.  The screen had been pushed up.  The window's cheap locks useless, and the vertical blinds leaving no protection.

Called the cops.  They came with their questions and their fingerprinting powder, but they probably won't find the guy.

A peeping tom turned bold.

I feel so violated.  My home isn't safe.  

Of course I've heard stories of things like this happening before, but I never thought it would happen to me.

Edit:

Wow.  Thank you all for the advice and well wishes.  I give you all an internet high-five.  Also, thank you for taking care of the few trolls for me-- it truly means a lot.

Yesterday was a very, very long day.

The window was a double-pane window.  Apparently, the top pane of the window had slipped slightly without us realizing, rendering the lock useless because the groves were slightly out of line.  We've had a lot of storms lately, with huge gusts of wind.  We should have made sure it was secure.  We're always so careful, though.  The front door is always bolted when we are inside.  We have a hotel lock and a cheap magnetic lock that we set when we go to bed.

Maintenance came and fixed the window yesterday.  We're cutting dowels today to prop into the window for extra security, like we have for our sliding glass door in the back.

The window beside it was secure.

We talked to the leasing office, and they are letting us get out of the lease 6 months early without any buy-outs or any other repercussions.  According to the cops, there has been an increase of peeping tom reports in my area.  No notice was given.  I requested the office send out an email to all residences about at least that threat.

We've been talking about adopting a dog for months.  Definitely happening now.  Thank you for all of the offers to loan us your four-legged family members!

I didn't mean to spark a gun debate, but I learned a lot from those posts.  I live in the South--the stereotype of the gun culture isn't exaggerated.  I've never been a huge gun fan myself, but I have shot a revolver and .38 before, and I'm not too bad of a shot on the range.  I know it's very different at home with fear and adrenaline running through my veins.  I've never handled a shotgun before.  For now, my fiance borrowed a friend's .45 with a double safety.  We hid magazines throughout the apartment.

I'm trying to keep my normal routine, and to stay busy.  Alone time=thinking time=me getting caught up in a ""what-if"" train.

Again, just thank you for the support.  It's difficult to talk about in real life, so this has been a great outlet.

Thank you to everyone who left me positive and encouraging comments/PMs, and I'm very glad many of you feel the same way I do, and I'm also very glad that many of you enjoyed this post. I needed to vent, and this is the result. 

The negative feedback I received, I was totally expecting. I know I sound like a raging bitch in this post - I was angry and thinking about everything when I wrote it. You have to understand, I've endured a literal lifetime of torment and torture from the time I was 5 until now, and I'm 21. I can't go one week without someone pointing out how fat I am - whether they are provoked or unprovoked. That's frustrating. That's infuriating, actually. It has made me pretty bitter on the inside about it, *but.* **Let me just get this clear, I don't care what people think about me.** Many of you who had something negative to say where saying something along the lines of ""well you shouldn't care what people think anyway."" I really don't give a shit what people think about me, but that doesn't mean it doesn't sting when I get called a fat ass or a fat bitch. Everybody still has feelings, guys. I live my life the way I want - as is obvious by my multiple tattoos, piercings, and different colored hair. I really *don't* care what people think about me, because I'm **actually happy with who I am.** 

That's another thing I need to clear up: I have accepted the way my body looks, and I am okay with it. I know I am a good person, a kind person, a loving and caring person. I feel beautiful on the inside and many of the people who are in my life would agree to that. But, I am doing myself an injustice by not trying to be my best. Ahisnd being my best includes being beautiful on the outside, too. When I started this weight loss journey, **I wasn't doing it for myself.** I was doing it for everyone else because I was tired of being the fat girl. I wanted everyone else in my life to be satisfied and happy that I was loosing weight. I cried almost every day, I felt like shit almost every day. Then, the first 10 lbs came off. It felt amazing. My jeans were looser. I sat down and took time to actually evaluate why I was doing this, and it occurred to me that I wasn't doing it for myself. And I knew, it wouldn't last if I didn't find some motivation. I kept remembering how good it felt to finally have a lose pair of size 22 jeans on me. I remembered how much better my body felt since I had cut out all the processed foods. I sat down and realized I disliked my body, and I was going to change it. This wasn't for anyone else anymore, this was *for me.* I dropped another 20 lbs and lost a jean size. Now it's really for me. It's satisfying to see the hardwork I put into this end in results. 

[coralfershoral](http://reddit.com/u/coralfershoral) said it best: ""Giving her the benefit of the doubt here (because I myself have these feelings and I have a boyfriend and I'm only about 10-20 lbs overweight)...
I don't think she NEEDS these things. I just think she wants to have these options in the back of her mind like most thin-bodied girls. She finally wants to have to turn positive attention away, instead of being insulted. It may be immature, but it's just a guilty fantasy in my case... "" *This. A million times over.* For those of you questioning why I want validation or ""why would I want this I have a boyfriend."" I *don't* want those things. But I want that option to be there. I want to be one of those girls people fawn over. I just, I don't think you guys can quite understand how much I feel like the only way I will be able to *truly* succeed in my adult life is by being thin and good-looking. I'm already well educated, intelligent, and pretty capable of a lot. But, if you can't agree that ""looks get you places,"" you're lying to yourself. I don't ever want to depend on looks to get me anywhere, but it'll certainly be a nice boost in my life. I love my boyfriend, he's going to be my husband, and I'm not looking to destroy that. But there's this ""guilty fantasy"" in my head where one day, some guy will think I'm pretty enough to just randomly approach me and tell me so, or such as: buy me shots at the bar when I'm out with my girlfriends. My boyfriend wants that for me, too. He wants me to turn heads and get those double takes. You know why? Because he's secure in our relationship and knows I won't be going anywhere because I love him too damn much. 

[NINETY_3](http://reddit.com/u/NINETY_3) said this: ""I think you can safely ignore most of the people in here. Most of them have no context to understand why you'd be sour on a lot of people. Fat people get to see just how ugly a lot of people really are on the inside. When you drop this weight, you're going to feel so fabulous. From your perspective, it'll seem like a revelation that life can be ""this easy."" Will it solve all of your problems? Obviously not. But seriously...it will solve a lot of them."" I am fucking sour on a lot of people because people have degraded me my whole life **because I had extra body weight,** like I had some kind of mutant disease. It's just extra fat, yet I've been treated as if I was subhuman my entire life. Will this solve all my problems? Absolutely not. If I expected it to, I'd be one stupid bitch. But it *will* solve a lot of my problems. Personal and health problems. And trust me, I understand that people will call me names my entire life. I get that, and I'm ready for that. People are just assholes, and that's the way it's going to be. **BUT.** What my goal is with this weight loss, is that my extra weight won't be the first immediate source of ammunition. If people are calling me fat, I know it's because they're just trying to dig at me and not because I'm actually fat. Can you understand that? I don't care about being called any names, I just don't want people to have ammunition to call me fat anymore. 

[worstluckever](http://reddit.com/u/worstluckever) Has the top comment, and the last part is stating: ""at least half of your list is self-hatred."" I'm sorry, are you overweight? Do you realize how annoying those ""self-hatred"" things I listed are? It's annoying as a woman to have that ""layer of fat under my arms"" because it makes wearing almost any bra really uncomfortable and nearly impossible to find a good one that fits well. That chunk of fat on my inner thighs? I hate it because it's the only place on my thighs I have excess fat, and it's goddamn annoying to have thighs that rub together when I want to wear shorts. The sweating thing? Would you like to be fucking sweaty for no reason? Like, you have to understand where I'm coming from. I'm not on my way to loathing fat people, more power to them. If other fat people are happy and want to stay fat, FINE! Good for them! I couldn't care less! But, that's just not the journey for me. All those self-hatred things I listed are mine alone, they are a daily annoyance *to me* and things I wish to change *about myself.* Thank you though, for ""not judging me"" based on the context of this post. This was post was written on pure adrenaline and anger, and it isn't who I really am. 

And for those of you asking: yes there will be more pictures to my Gonewild account as soon as I'm comfortable, and I will be posting before and after pictures. I'm going to start once I hit -50 lbs, because I know there will be a considerable difference in my appearance once I start loosing more weight.

*Original Post*   
I'm not even going to use a throwaway because I refuse to be ashamed about my body anymore. I am who I am, I am changing what I don't like, and I will not let anyone shit on me anymore for being overweight. If you can't stand the image of a woman with extra weight then just don't read this, don't bother telling me I'm fat and ugly. You can't destroy what's already broken. 

I stepped on the scale this morning, I'm sitting at 265 lbs. I haven't weighed this much in almost 5 years. I'm lighter today than I was at 16. That blows my mind, I can't believe. I'm 3 lbs away from being at that -30 lbs mark... it's so close, and I am just dying to hit that mark. 30 lbs in four months... remarkable. 

I've lost a jean size. I can actually wear jeans now and I don't have that little bit of belly that hangs over. I can button my jeans, and the denim and my stomach are flush. Do you know what an incredible feeling that is? Do you realize I fucking bawled my eyes out the first day I realized that my stomach was getting smaller? 

I've been called fat, disgusting, ugly... every name in the book since I was 5 years old. I can't wait for people to not have ammo against me. I can't wait for the day where the first insult won't be ""fat bitch,"" ""fat ass,"" ""ugly bitch."" I can't wait till you're only calling me a fat bitch to dig at me, because I'm fucking beautiful. 

I won't even lie, I'm losing weight because I want to look better. Yeah, my health is improving, and that's great. But this is all for looks. Because I want to finally be considered beautiful. I want people to finally, fucking finally, pay attention to me.

So stupid asshole can't call me names anymore.  
So guys won't say they rather cut their dick off than have sex with me.  
So skinny cunts can't all point and laugh.   
So nobody can talk about me.  
So I can finally walk down the street without being stared or gawked at.   
So I can finally walk in the mall and not see the 15 year old sluts laughing at me while I uncomfortably tug on my shirt because they can make me feel so fucking insecure.   
So I can finally walk into Victoria's Secret and not have to dig and hunt for XL boyshorts.   
So I can finally walk into Victoria's Secret and fit into a Bombshell Bra.   
So I can finally walk into a clothing store and buy a pair of jeans that is less than a size 20.   
So I can finally walk into a clothing store and buy a shirt that isn't a L or XL.   
So I can finally buy sandals that my feet don't bulge out of.  
So I can finally wear short-shorts without being stared at like I'm some demon out of Hell.  
So I can finally feel comfortable naked in front of my boyfriend.   
So I can finally actually feel beautiful.  
So I can have some stranger tell me I'm beautiful.  
So I can finally be one of those bitches that ""doesn't turn heads, but breaks necks.""  
So I can finally, just finally, feel like I'm not worthless.  
So people will actually start talking to me and getting to know who I am, instead of automatically dismissing me because I'm fat.  
So I can finally find a bra that my fat isn't spilling out of the sides.   
So I finally don't have this absurd chunk of fat on my inner thighs.   
So I finally don't have that gross ""layer"" of fat on my back underneath my arms.   
So I can finally apply makeup to my eyes, and it actually look nice.   
So I can finally not have a moon face.  
So I can finally take pictures of myself without hating every second of it.  
So I can finally be in group photos and be okay with standing in the front.  
So that when I go to another rave, I won't be told to stand aside by the photographer because I'm not one of the ""pretty girls.""  
So that I will actually be invited to parties and to places.   
So that I can go shopping with my friends and can actually wear the same clothes as them.   
So that I can take cute pictures of myself and have people ""like it"" because I'm pretty.   
So that I can sit in those weird desks at my university comfortably.  
So that I won't feel like I have to wear an overshirt with any tanktop I have.   
So that I can walk around my house half naked and not give one fuck.  
**So I can finally wear a bikini.**  
So I will finally be pretty enough for guys to want to buy me shots at the bar.  
So that my coworkers will stop making jokes about how fucking a fat girl is disgusting.  
So I can go to the beach and feel okay swimming in front of other people.  
So I won't feel so self-conscious riding a water slide at the water park.  
So I won't just fucking feel self-conscious at all, fuck.   
So when I go to a restaurant, I don't get disgusted looks from the staff when I order a cheeseburger.  
So, if I really wanted to, I could take those absurd body shots that women do to show how flat their stomach is in their bikini.  
So I can finally just stop sweating like a goddamn pig, when there's no reason for me to be sweating.   
So my knees will stop hurting.  
So my back will stop hurting.  
So I don't have to worry about ""weight limits"" or ""Am I going to break this?"" when I sit in a lounge chair.   
So when I ride the rollercoaster, the seatbelt isn't snug as fuck on me.  

And most importantly, so I can finally let out a big fuck you to every single putrid person who dogged me my whole life for being fat. This is all this is, so I can finally be a normal fucking person. SO FINALLY PEOPLE WILL JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. SO FINALLY I CAN BE FUCKING PRETTY AND ACCEPTABLE BY THESE FUCKING INSANE SOCIAL MEDIA BRAINWASHED STANDARDS. 

Just, fuck you. Fuck every single person who has ever called me fat, ugly, ect. I'm a beautiful person on the inside, and I'm not fucking ugly or hideous, but I'm not pretty nor acceptable by society's standards. I can't wait for the day I'm beautiful on the outside too, just so I can tell everybody fuck you.

Normally, we aren't all dispatched to a call of this nature, but a man was heard screaming on the other end, and we had no further information on the call.  Dispatch was able to ping the phone and the closest address they could get was the main address for this apartment complex.  For an hour we canvassed the whole place with the help of the fire department, but we found nothing.  Just as we were clearing from the apartment, we were dispatched to assist EMS with a full arrest 3 blocks away.

It was at that home that we found the source of our 911 call.  It was a bloodbath.  The victim had accidentally shot himself in the leg with a .45 caliber Colt revolver, rupturing his femoral artery.  He managed to call 911, but that was all he was able to do.  The 911 call he made is horrific, but even worse was the second call nearly an hour later when his wife called.  Seeing death is never pleasant, but this was intensely troubling to me; not only was it accidental, but his wife, now a widow, was at his feet.  She clutched his shoes, murmuring his name, muttering prayers, and asking me if it was real.  She asked him to get up.  She asked him to open his eyes.  She held my hand as I lead her out of the kitchen to her waiting family members outside.  She held me so tight that it sent thundering shockwaves through my heart.  I could almost feel her grief and sorrow.  It was all I could do not to crumble.  I had no comforting words.  I wished with all my heart that I could change what had happened here, but I could do absolutely nothing.

I have not been overcome with such grief in a very long time.  I had seen and talked to this man myself a week prior.  He was the victim of theft.  Now, his body lay lifeless on the floor of his kitchen, steeped in his own blood.  He had a son, a wife, and a family.  His death was nothing short of absolutely tragic.

After the detectives arrived, I drove around town for what seemed like an hour, quietly weeping for that family.  This was a cruel and unusual circumstance.  Every day I put on my badge and my gun, knowing that I may deal with things that hurt me, or even kill me.  But beneath the badge and under that uniform is a heart that is nowhere near impervious to these things.

I don't really have a point with this anecdote, but I desperately needed to put my experience and more importantly, my emotions, to paper.

Every time the tv turns on, it's on Nickelodeon and Spongebob is on.  If I try and suggest we watch anything else, she'll reluctantly give in but you can tell she's not happy about it.  And when she's not happy, nobody's happy.  I reckon I've seen every single episode twice by now, and can quote a lot of them by heart.  I am so sick of that stupid yellow sponge.

Edit - Howdy guys.  I didn't think this would get near as much response as it did.  I'm gonna try and address some of the more common questions/comments that I've been getting.

* My woman is recently 21 years old.  She's not a child, I'm not a pedophile, I get it that Spongebob is a kids show holy crap

* We have a Netflix account that we both use, but the internet at home is so terrible that we usually can't load a full movie.  Occasionally it'll work and we can watch a good movie, documentary, or something not about cartoon sea life.  It's just not worth it most of the time.

* Watching Spongebob is not *all* she does.  We're both in college and working part-time jobs.  She'll also read, watch movies, do homework, work around the house, knit.  Honestly we watch a very small amount of TV, It's just that when we do, it's that yellow douchebag 75% of the time.

* We're gonna have a talk and discuss divvying up TV time between the two of us for fairness' sake.  Sometimes a man just has to watch The History Channel.

So unfortunately, that means I can't share this story with anyone (when I think it's a pretty cool/funny story).

So today during a lecture, I can feel the yogurt and mozzarella sticks I had eaten basically wrestling with each other in my stomach. I try to be strong, I fail, and I end up speed-walking straight to the bathroom. In said bathroom, at least a liter of poop poured from my open asshole, and I'm pretty sure a good 72% of it was straight up liquid.

So after a few minutes, my stomach rumbles die down, and it's time to inspect the damage. I'm looking at the five pounds worth of poop that's made its way to the toilet bowl, and I see something small and yellow.

I look a little closer (like any normal person would) and I realize it's a tiny golden corn kernel, perfectly in tact! And at first I freak out a bit, cause I'm like ""I can't even remember the last time I had corn, is it even in season??"" but then I remember my dinner last night consisted mostly of corn.

While I'm here, I might as well confess something else asshole-related. My hair is about 2 feet long (and blonde just in case you'd like a better visual), so it tends to get in the way of things sometimes. Sometimes it ends up in my vagina-area, and I have to pull it out slowly (which can actually feel kind of cool sometimes).

Moving on, one day I'm lying in bed tryna get in my comfort zone, and my hand feels a hair ""down there"". So I start pulling, and it feels strange. Then I realize this hair is not in the vagina vicinity, but in the asshole area.

So I keep fighting the good fight, and I make another great realization: the hair is IN my asshole. So then I pulled all 24 inches of that never-ending hair out of my tight little booty.

I think these two incidents are kind of cool, but like I said, girls don't have buttholes, so that means I can only tell people anonymously through reddit.

If you read this whole thing, god bless your sweet heart.

It read ""Thanks for wasting my time you bitch."" Upon looking further into this status I find that this guy, someone I used to call a friend had been pursuing a female for roughly 4 months. When he brought up going out she declined and said

 ""Sorry I just don't like you that way"" 

This pisses me off so much. 

A.If you see a girl you like and you become her friend in hopes of having a relationship with her that's fine. BUT if she declines and you consider it all a waste of time you're not a real friend. You're a fake one. 

B.Most ânice guysâ hate having to be someoneâs friend when their only interest was banging or having a relationship with them, and then get all pissed at the girl when she doesn't want things that way.

C. If you want to be in a relationship with them you have to show some signs in the beginning. I'm not saying anything big, make it subtle. If it doesn't work then deal with it. It's not her fault she doesn't like you that way

It's one thing to fall in love with someone who doesn't love you back and wants to be friends. Sometimes it can be hard to be friends with a person you're in love with but it's not being ""friend zoned"". You can't help who you or they have feelings for. It's not a waste of time to be someones friend.

And to guys who think if you're super nice a girl will like you, sorry but you're an idiot if you think that is true. I've been rejected, everyone has. Grow from it, don't bitch about it.

There is nothing with being friends with someone of the opposite sex, people worry too much about having a girlfriend or boyfriend. The right person will come along, just enjoy the damn ride.

There could be gold inside, or crystals, or just more quartz. I'll never know. But it has rough raggedy edges that hurt when I squeeze too tight, which sometimes I need to do. I miss you.

Abstract moons like Oberon and Triton, or Titan and Callisto, just shit that's why out in space, totally separated and unrelated to us. Looking out into the blackness and knowing home is years upon years of travel time away.

Just the idea that as far out as our moon, everything we do and everything we are, is just irrelevant out there. It's so foreign and alien that it gives me goose bumps and makes me wanna cry kind of, just out of the shear loneliness and terror.

I often have dreams about waking up on some foreign moon, without a space suit on and feeling freezing cold, looking up at a giant and foreboding gas giant of a planet filling up the black sky. Most would say it's beautiful, and it really is, but it's equally horrifying. The apathetic blackness of space is crueler than our world could ever be.

The apathy is what scares me the most. We aren't even meant to exist out there. The uncaring and violent nature of space, paired with setting foot on land that was never designed for life, is just suffocatingly scary to me. It's as alien as it gets. The only thing scarier than that is waking up on a moon, in another galaxy, at the other end of the universe. At that point, you may as well be in a different reality.

What's even scarier is that things are so far away that most of what we see may not even be there anymore. Things are so far away that hundreds of generations can go by before something appears in the sky, and even then that same object at the other end could be gone by then. 

The more I think about it, the more I realize earth is *literally* the only link we have, and we're vulnerable as fuck. It's like Earth is a bubble floating around in a hail storm above an erupting volcano set off by a nuclear blast. If Earth is destroyed or ruined, space is just gonna do what it does and not care.

1364058332.0,273,self.offmychest,1av6rg,"Three years ago, I tried to kill myself. I am thankful every day since that I failed.",BlueRaspberry,317,44,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1av6rg/three_years_ago_i_tried_to_kill_myself_i_am/,"Three years ago, I was in a bad place.

My roommate was a scumbag who would steal money from me to buy cocaine, and lie to my face about it. He was always late paying his half of the rent and utilities, and on more than one occasion, I got a call from a bartender asking me to bring his drunk ass home after his debit card was declined. He'd bring douchebag bros home with him, and they would stink up the apartment with cigarettes while listening to Lil Wayne till four in the morning. The cops came three times due to noise complaints. The entire time I would sit in my room, lock the door, and secretly hope that one of them would OD on coke or get alcohol poisoning. He would borrow my car without asking, usually when he was drunk, and causally dropped in a conversation once that he didn't know my car could go 125 mph.

I worked at Pizza Hut for five years, first as a driver, then as a manager. I liked driving, but getting promoted to manager was a nightmare. First, our restaurant general manager was a great guy, the best boss I ever had. He was in grad school for Russian studies, and after getting his master's, he moved to Russia to teach English. The guy they got to replace him is the biggest asshole I've ever met. First of all, he had no clue when it came to hygiene. He would show up to work reeking of cat piss, cigarettes and BO. He would yell at me for the tiniest mistakes or for no reason at all. He had a four-year-old daughter who lived with her mother, and she swore like a sailor. And to top it all off, he was rude to customers. We lost so much business because of him. He once called a female customer a cunt to her face. I was gobsmacked. He'd always schedule me for pain-in-the-ass shifts and leave himself most of the easy days. I ended up working more hours as a manager, but making less money. And to top it all off, he was a Yankees fan.

So between having to deal with these two excuses for men, I was fighting more and more with my girlfriend. She has an anxiety disorder, which made things even more stressful. Finally after one night, April 7, 2010, I lost it. I had an awful shift at work, had to come home to my roommate's asinine antics, then got into a fight with my girlfriend who had an anxiety attack over something I had done almost four years prior. I snapped, kicked her out of my apartment at three in the morning, and crawled into a handle of vodka.

The next morning, I called to apologize, but it was too late. The damage had been done, and after almost five years, we were no longer a couple. The next couple months just got rougher. My best friend moved to Tennessee to go to law school, and my mother got into a fight with my ex. And I still had to deal with a deadbeat roommate and the boss from hell.

Every Tuesday, I would go to a bar for pub trivia. I had a core team of nerds and we would usually dominate. It was the only thing that I seemed to enjoy anymore. Then one Tuesday, May 25, 2010, my ex showed up with her new boyfriend. Watching them hug and kiss was brutal, and my friends bought me drinks out of sympathy. As I sat there, I forgot about the game, I didn't care anymore. My former beloved was across from me kissing her new man, I had to be to Pizza Hut at 8am the next morning for a 12-hour-plus shift with my scumbag boss, and I still lived with a dirtbag liar and thief. It was right then and there I decided I didn't want to be alive anymore.

I got up and left. As I drove home, I contemplated crashing my car into something, but I figured it was too safe and I would probably survive. When I got home, my roommate was watching TV and informed me that we were out of beer. I brushed him off and went to my room and waited for him to fall asleep.

When he went to his room and closed the door, I took my pull-up bar and attached it to my door frame. Then I took off my belt, made a loop, and tied it on. I put my head through the loop, but my feet were still on the ground. I remember thinking to myself, ""I can't do anything right, even killing myself."" I got a chair and stood on it, tied the loop smaller, put it around my neck and kicked away the chair. The last thing I remember before I lost consciousness was that I wasn't afraid. Looking back now, that was the strangest thing: the total lack of fear.

The next thing I know, I'm being wheeled into the emergency room. It was the most disorienting feeling in the world. I was strapped to the gurney, completely immobilized, and my entire body felt like it was being poked with pins and needles. I remember more now, but at the time it was so disorienting. After hanging for about three or four minutes, the belt snapped and I fell, waking up my roommate. He came out of his room and saw me convulsing on the floor, so he dialed 911. The paramedics arrived and treated me. I remember being able to hear them, and feel them moving me on to the stretcher, but I couldn't see or speak. My tongue felt too big for my mouth. I fought with them when they tried to strap me down and screamed loudly. It wasn't until I was in the emergency room when I realized what happened: I tried to kill myself, failed, and now I'm in the hospital.

That was when the most heartbreaking part of the whole ordeal happened: My mom came in. She was crying and put her hand on my head, which just made me cry even more. I told her what happened in the bar, but she told me to shush, that everything was going to be okay. As I slowly came back, my entire body started to ache. My legs were the worst; they felt cramped like I hadn't moved in days. The doctor came in and explained to my mom and me that I had hit my head pretty hard when I fell, and they wanted to transfer me to a bigger hospital to get a CT scan to see if I had any bleeding in my head. They loaded me into an ambulance and took me. The entire time, I was still strapped down and couldn't move. My entire body was aches and pains. Every muscle hurt, my head was pounding, and my throat was raw.

After arriving at the other hospital, they finally undid the straps so I could stretch my legs. I got a CT scan and the doctors said everything looked okay, so they transferred me to the psych ward. They put me in a room, and it was the first time I was alone with my mom, who followed the ambulance. I sobbed on her shoulder for what felt like an hour, then a nurse brought me some lunch. I had to take tiny bites because it hurt so bad to swallow.

I was then transferred back to my hometown hospital and admitted to their behavioral health department. They kept me in confinement for the first night to make sure I wouldn't try to hurt myself again. I took a shower and removed all the electrodes the paramedics had put in me. The inside of my elbows were bruised from all the IVs I had, and the electrodes left red welts. I remember noticing that the shower curtain was on a breakaway wire. There was another guy in confinement with who looked like Zach Galifinakis. He shit his pants and started screaming racial slurs so security strapped him to his bed and took him to another room.

After my first night, they moved me to the main ward, and I got to know the other patients and the ward. There was an elderly woman who was a meth addict, there was a young girl who had postpartum depression and had tried to kill her baby, and there was a lawyer who lost a big case and tried to kill himself. I had a huge blue and purple welt on my neck from where the belt had dug into me, so it must have been obvious to the other patients why I was in; none of them needed to ask.

It was while I was in that ward, reading Reader's Digest Condensed Books and watching daytime TV with other patients, that I really learned to appreciate being alive. Pretty much every member of my family came to visit, and I had some deep talks with the nurses and patients. The lawyer told me about the big case he lost, so he parked his Mercedes in his garage and left it running. His wife had found him and took him to the hospital. I saw his wife when she came to visit and she was breathtaking. I remember thinking that I couldn't imagine why that guy would want to kill himself. He had a big house, a Mercedes, a beautiful wife, and a partnership at a law firm. That more than anything made me realize how depression can happen to anyone. Most of my friends were out of state, and they called almost every day. I was admitted to the hospital on the morning of Wednesday, May 26. That upcoming Monday was Memorial Day, so I wasn't released until the next Tuesday. I told my folks I was going to move back in with them until I got my life sorted out. I quit my job at Pizza Hut, but I ended up getting evicted from my apartment anyway because my roommate hadn't paid his half of the rent in four months. My old manager ended up getting fired for getting caught by the health inspector not washing his hands after using the bathroom.

Three years later and I am in such a better place. I went back to college and graduated this time, and moved to Florida where the weather is nice and the people make me feel sane. I haven't been in a serious relationship since then; I've been on dates and had some hook-ups, but that's it. I'm not complaining though because that gave me lots of me time, which I desperately needed. I got a prescription for Prozac, and had weekly sessions with a psychologist for a year after getting out of the hospital; both helped greatly. My Doc was great, and would help me sort out the thoughts I was having that were harmful or unhelpful. I always considered myself a smart guy in touch with my feelings until then; the Doc helped me even more by pointing out when I was suppressing my emotions or letting them get the better of me.

I have been sitting here crying for the past two hours. I can't believe the sheer amount of love and support this has drawn out of the woodwork--I am in awe. I want everyone to know I am okay for right now; my biggest fear is losing my home and with it, my education; it is already taking all of my strength to keep my grades and attendance up. My hope is to speak with my former boss and see if he will take me back (I loved my job and I think they liked me there, so there's a chance). I wrote this primarily because I wished I could tell my family and friends--I miss them so much but the few I've told were, to be frank, pretty cruel, so I haven't been speaking to anyone else.

I cannot tell you, all of you, how much your kindness and acceptance and internet hugs have meant to me. It has been like a release, reading everything here and knowing someone, somewhere cares-- it is beyond my ability to express.

*******

Thank you for raping me.

Thank you for those first days of class, when I was alone and scared and you came to me as a friend. Thank you for giving me something solid to hold onto, something safe in an uncertain new world. Thank you for listening to me and being my friend, for making me believe, in my innocence, that you cared for me.

Thank you for telling me to come over the night my sister was in the hospital while I sobbed hysterically over the phone. Thank you for promising to listen, and telling me that it would all be okay. Thank you for giving me a safe place to turn when I needed a friend the most.

Thank you for every time you offered me âanother drinkâ when you knew I didnât like it. Thank you for stopping me from leaving when I became uncomfortable with the way you kept touching me. Thank you for ignoring me when I said âplease donâtâ and âstop, Iâve never done this before, it hurts.â Thank you for snapping at me for bleeding on your new sheets. Thank you for saying you had âruined me foreverâ and that I had better stay with you because âno one would ever want you again now.â Thank you for leaving me shaking on the sidewalk three hours later because you had work in the morning and needed your rest.

Thank you for calling me again and again and again. Making sure I knew I belonged to you, and thank you to myself for being scared and deluded enough to believe it. Thank you for isolating me from my friends and family, for threatening me if I told them anything. Thank you for calling me cunt, whore, piece of shit, worthless bitch, for locking me in your apartment and refusing to let me leave or eat or sleep until you were done screaming at me. Thank you for all your insults, your determination to make meâa straight-A student, a brilliant writer and artist, a kind and loving friend, volunteer, worker, personâinto a vessel for all your hatred.

Thank you for lying about your alcoholism and your drug use and your bitter, ugly divorce. Thank you for shoving me into walls and pulling my hair and making me cry in front of your friends. Thank you for flirting with other girls in front of me just so I knew you could. Thank you for slamming my head into a brick wall when you thought I was cheating on you (I wasnât.) Thank you for raping me again and again, without protection, without caring if I was tired or sick or so scared I couldnât breathe.

Thank you for all the times I sat on the floor of my bathroom, fresh from puking my guts up, shaking and whimpering, praying the pain would end. Thank you for the fifteen pounds I didnât have to lose, that put me in the category of dangerously underweight. Thank you for my hair falling out and my nails breaking and daily, vicious panic attacks. Thank you for the electric fear that comes with every buzz of my phone that I was trained to know meant you needed me, right now, this is not a request.

Thank you for harassing me when I tried to leave. Thank you for threatening to kill yourself and me with you. Thank you for destroying my self-esteem, my hope, my life, my chance at having my first time be with someone who loved me, who cared for me. Thank you for bringing a thousand new phobias into my life that will never leave me. Thank you for teaching me not to trust, to always be afraid, to nurse the shame and hatred you created in the pit of me until it bloomed like a poisonous flower.

 Thank you for taking me apart. I will never have my revenge. You got away with it. You know you did too, if the letters and lies you keep sending are any indication. They say to go live your best life, to move on. There is no moving on. This is where it ends, right here.

Thank you for a year of hell. Goodbye for ever.

Everything is fine and then sunday we wake up to all your stuff gone and my 3 year old non verbal autistic daughters ipad missing- along with our very old ipod touch we were letting you use... We cant afford another ipad, we couldn't afford the first one, my lovely mother in law got it for her... now that we are missing it, we can no longer work with our daughter, we can't know if she is sick, hungry, tired, NOTHING- she doesn't speak at all, makes sounds, but that's it!! You took part of her life away, her ability to have her needs met, yes we have a schedule and she is not going to go hungry or anything but who in the hell does that!!! Who steals from a disabled child, and after everything we did for you, gave you, when we shouldn't have, but we know what its like to be without and wanted to help you... And this is how you say thanks!! You leave my front door open, you take what you wanted and walk out... and why I can't understand... also why did you take all the stupid crap, like my husband contacts, and one of his coats, why didn't you take the laptop, or xbox, or anything else, but your smart self took two things that can be tracked... good luck, can't wait until the police find you, cause oh yes we filed a report... I also can't wait until karma catches up as well... but the worst part of this for me, is the confusion, I keep thinking the items will just appear out of nowhere, just be back where we left them, but I know deep down we will never get any of it back....

It nearly killed me, because the antibodies did not develop at that age, and my immune system tanked (down to zero) before anyone knew it was anything. My mom thought I had a bad cold. Something like a week later she was literally dragging me out of the house, as my body was rejecting all food and fluids as if they and I were magnetically opposed. My immune system was obliterated. My carpet stunk of Gatorade and stomach acid. I couldn't lift my arm more than an inch. I had weird spots all over my palms and the soles of my feet. My mom was skeptical. She stood at the bottom of the stairs and called up into my bedroom for me to come down, we're going to the doctor and we can't be late. But I can't mom. Tyler, enough, lets go. I CAN'T. And my bravado causes me to pull myself from my futon onto the floor, crawling like a dying crab toward the stairs as she comes up them. I am dry heaving, sobbing, weakly grasping at carpet fibers like an enraged infant. So we missed the appointment. We went to the emergency room. Like it had to happen that second. Which is correct: it did need to happen that second. But three days had passed all ready. Three days of no liquid, let alone solid food. Three days of the worst ""cold"" in history. Three days of mounting anxiety. Three days like that's all it would take. Three days and then... poof. 

I almost died. The doctors were genuinely surprised I wasn't comatose, let alone driven there not by an EMT but my mother, flustered, stark, probably wishing she would die before she watched me go. I tried to make peace. But what can that even mean at age fifteen?(Fact: Nothing. Lest not in 'Murica, where adolescence is code for ""free-range prison"".) Instead, I was full of a bitterness and anger that I have carried with me ever since; so bitter that my life was cut short, angry that all I could feel in my heart was bitterness and rage. 

Two bottles of hemoglobin (at $14,000 a pop) saved my life. They treated me not knowing it would work. It was a last ditch effort. The sickness had yet to be (and, officially, never would be) categorized.

It wasn't until I was 19 that I finally tested positive. No doctor has ever connected the dots, but deductive reasoning leaves HIV as the most likely culprit. A number of factors led to this conclusion. My CD4 count (the all-important white blood cells) at the time of diagnosis were so low that it was apparent I had been carrying HIV for three to four years. Also, one of the only test-positive results they found at the hospital when I was sick was CMV (a common virus) in abundance. I'm pretty sure they put CMV down as the cause of my symptoms, officially, even though CMV looks nothing like what I had. Only certain aspects of my condition suggested that result. CMV is carried by a majority of the people on the planet. I want to say %80. It only becomes troublesome when coupled with a depleted immune system, such as that found in the wake of a vicious HIV infection. We're talking late-stage AIDS, not just a weakened immune system. Almost nothing. Zero.

I'm 24 now. I feel like I died in that hospital room, not knowing why I was dying, or what was killing me. I felt myself change. Lost twenty pounds in a week just by lack of food and fluids. More importantly, I felt myself change inside. I felt my heart breaking such as I never knew it could. This feeling, a gut-wrenching anguish, like watching someone dump a bucket of bleach on your future. That feeling is always waiting for me if I peek inside. It never left.

It became who I am today. I'll never know the (undoubtedly better) man I would have been had none of this happened. I'll never live a day without resisting my hateful urge to push the blame onto the people I love most. My mother. My sister and father. My friends. But mostly my mom. I love her more than anything in the world, except a part of me kept tucked away is still lying in that bed and hating her with every shriveled cell of my being. 

My family and some close friends came to visit me when there was neither a prognosis nor improvement. They said all the things they would say if they knew they would never see me again. I wasn't fully aware this was happening until after the fact. My life was pain.  I just looked at them and tried to smile. I was filled with inexplicable shame for my condition. (Had I know the cause was HIV, I might have attempted suicide just to save some morsel of dignity.) My gall bladder was the size of a tennis ball, emanating stinging pain like electricity. My whole body, especially my eyes, were as yellow as a banana. Bacterial pneumonia came on hard and fast. This feels like fire under your rib cage. 

Worst of all, it was Halloween. When they started injecting the hemoglobin (which I was told would cause only a mild headache, but which in actuality caused the most brain-splitting pain I have ever known) the only thing on TV was an edited version of Halloween 3: Season of the Witch. Because the world hated me. And it made damn sure I knew it.

I struggle every day with this history. At the time only my closest relatives, and very few friends, knew anything close to the truth. But the kicker... the horrible truth... I'll tell you, your troubles are only ever yours forever. Even the worst tragedy will be absolved by those witnesses left scarred by your plight. No matter the outcome, it is cauterized. We've got a knack for it. They came to my bed. They sat quietly. They looked at death, and it was me.   And they forgot. I want to shout that part because the coldness of it is such a shock that you can't help but sputter at the indignity. They didn't change. Of course not. People aren't characters. They don't have arcs, they have lines. They moved on. They walked down the road. Because I survived, and it was highschool, and drama is everywhere, and no one really cares about the sick kid for more than a week, unless they die (and then they get two, tops, plus a memorial service). But a part of me DIDN'T make it. I'm the only person in the whole wide world that watched it go. The best I can do is try to remember the spot where it disappeared into the distance, and use it like a compass as I go forward into an uncanny future . It gets harder the further I go.

TL;DR I got HIV, it almost killed me, and in a lot of ways it did.

1350481072.0,273,self.offmychest,11mnbf,On sluts,missingamitten,329,56,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/11mnbf/on_sluts/,"Puberty, for me, was the onset of what would turn out to become a very long internal war.  This is the first of many peace treaties; a reconciliation of dueling sides of my consciousness. 

The word slut drips with disdain.  It needs no context to be utterly disgusting.  Very few other words hold such a consistently unflattering, unapologetic connotation when standing alone.  Interestingly, most of those words are also associated with being female or feminine.  

As a young woman suckled into maturity at the teat of a patriarchal society, I have struggled for the majority of my life with the conflict of my inherent sexuality and its archenemy--the one which is presented to and expected of me.  I'd like to point out that these expectations are not perpetuated by men.  These expectations are perpetuated by women.

I was raised to believe that self-respect and promiscuity are more or less mutually exclusive.  It was such a prominent mantra in my teen years that I never even thought to question its validity.  In fact it's so ingrained that it still feels mildly uncomfortable to deny, despite all contradicting logic.  I submitted to attributing my hyperactive sex drive (and its resulting escapades) to clearly having no self-respect, which confused me because I felt like I had a great deal of it.  That said, I have come to the conclusion that not only is it an superficial and archaic moral, but one that is degenerative to any woman.  An oasitic empire has been constructed around the value of sex: complete with gilded walls and unnecessarily large towers.  

Maybe it's just me, but the level of respect I have for myself is certainly not a product of the level of chastity I choose to exercise.  In other words, I respect myself not because I choose to withhold from sex when I want it--how silly does that sound?--but because I have worked hard to be able to say I am proud of my character.  Sexually prudent I am admittedly not, but if I were I couldn't imagine that it should hold more weight to my self-image than kindness, honesty, loyalty, intelligence, acceptance, courage, sincerity, integrity, or really just about any other core value.  

Being sexually conservative is by no means a bad thing.  It's a tremendous display of self-control which should be applauded.  The self-control, I mean.  You know that thing you do when you put a bone cookie on your dog's nose, and he sits there cross-eyed and patient, waiting anxiously and pleading silently for you to give him the go-ahead?  It's the same concept: the pride you have for your clever puppy is the same pride you should have for yourself.  Withholding from something which is not harmful to you is solely (not to be diminished) a feat of self-control.  That's right.  Sex is not harmful.  It will only ever impact you negatively when done irresponsibly, with malice, or with unreciprocated expectation.  As long as you can discern and avoid those situations, sex is actually fantastic for your health, your mind, and your body.  

Removing the pretty veil someone at some point draped over sex and being able to understand it for what it really is has been one of the most liberating experiences of my development as a woman.  Not only have I been freed from the belief that my sexuality defines my honor, but I have been able to express myself sexually without the guilt I've been taught to harbor.  Being able to define sex so objectively has inevitably resolved another conflict I'm used to encountering.  Suddenly, there is a very distinct divide between sex and intimacy.  You can experience sex without intimacy, and you can experience intimacy without sex.  As much as one enhances the other, they still exist independently.  

Teaching women that sex is the thing that men need to 'earn' from us is total bullshit.  We have so much more to offer that is so much more valuable.  Sex is pennies.  A woman's love is gold.  Sure, we all know men want sex, but let's be honest--we do, too.  If a man wants pennies, give them to him!  Maybe that's all he wants, but it's his loss and it's important to understand that it's unlikely he'll change. Better to give him his chump change for free and watch him walk off with it, than hold some pennies for ransom until he gets close enough to waste any of your gold on.  


EDIT: Didn't think so many people would read this... I'd like to apologize if I offended anyone and make it clear that all views on sex and personal decisions made on those values should be respected.  The post wasn't about a 'correct' view, it was intended to question the societally accepted relationship that seems to bind sex and morality.",,False,,t5_2ranw,1351298798.0,,,True,t3_11mnbf,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/11mnbf/on_sluts/,

I know two languages, my name is foreign, but for the most part I identify as British. I speak like a posh bloke, I have British friends and British mannerisms, I'm white and look incredibly English. Basically it I didn't have a foreign name you'd mistake me for an English guy.

Before I started my first proper job, I was the most anti-racist, anti-homophobia Social Justice Warrior you'd met. If I even caught a sniff of casual racism from one of my friends I'd call them out on it instantly, always the mood killer. (Although oddly enough racist jokes are perfectly fine with me). 

Then at 16 I got a job at a small printing shop in the little town where I live. Even though the people who live here are quite ""well off"" we live next to an immigrant sinkhole and so we get a mixture of people coming in. 

The British people are so fucking polite. They're a pleasure to serve; black or white, they know the social mannerisms of living in the UK, they'll chat with me while I'm serving them, they'll apologise and put things back in the right place, they'll pay for things without question, they won't argue with me. I really, really like the people in my town. 

Asians and Arabs though. Urgh. In Britain what we mean by Asians are not the East Asians, but the ones from the India/Bangladesh etc area. Them, and the Iranians and Pakistanis and basically any person from that kind of area really, really annoy me now. 

They seem to have no awareness for the social rules in England. It's really starting to piss me off, and I see why there's a lot of latent racism within native Britons. They'll speak loudly in their own language (which I an understand makes people uncomfortable in public settings) and always talk over me or cut me off. They'll bring 5 of their kids into the shop, letting them pick everything up and just leave them on the floor or steal . They'll demand to cut in front of the line for a 10p photocopy because they're in a rush. Most of them smell horrible for some reason. They'll argue and haggle over the price of something for as little as 10p and leave in a huff if I don't give it to them. They'll ask for discounts on everything like they're my best friend they've known for years. They'll attempt to steal, they'll also try to ""trick"" me into thinking I gave them less change than I actually did. They'll come in their big group of friends, talking loudly, picking things up and leaving them halfway across the shop, and leave without buying anything. They'll complain over everything; the darkness of prints, the quality of paper, and demand I improve their prints for free ""because I'm charging too much anyway"". 

When I first started working here, I tried to be optimistic. ""It's only a few bad eggs, the rest are really nice people"", and for a part that was true. There's a lovely Pakistani woman that comes in every week and always chats to me about my A-Levels and tells me about her son, just like there's the douchebag English businessmen and entitled housemums that really get on my nerves. But I've slowly realised that stereotypes and generalisations are there for a *reason*. Most of the Asians and Arabs that come into the shop fall under this category of "" wow they're so fucking annoying and entitled"". I know the term ""refusal to integrate"" is thrown around a lot, but this is seriously the problem that I can see. I now understand why my white overweight football watching beer drinking boss is such a massive racist. When a lot of these immigrants (a lot of them don't even work), don't even speak the language of the country they're in, and still go by their own values and social rules that don't hold ground in England (for example haggling), it must get pretty frustrating for the locals! The engineer who comes and works on our printers is an Indian man called Dash; he has a cockney accent and he spends the whole day talking to my boss about football, they're great friends and he always gives my boss a discount or sometimes works for free, while my boss always pays him up front in cash. His ethnicity does not play a part at all, because besides the skin colour, he's incredibly British; he understands the social cues and mannerisms, he doesn't speak with an accent, he understands pop culture and jokes. I wish a lot of the Asian and Arab immigrants in England would just learn proper English and understand the excluding themselves in their own little solitary neighbourhoods and friendship/family groups  is part of the driving force behind the racism towards them. 

Obviously next generation everything will be a bit better. The Asian kids growing up with us are just as British as everyone else; it's just this initial immigrant influx that causes all the problems at the moment. 

I'm just mad at myself because I went and changed my own moral values. And it's totally hypocritical because I'm a foreigner as well. Urgh. ",,False,,t5_2ranw,False,,,True,t3_1guo0o,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1guo0o/working_a_customer_service_job_has_made_me_a/,

I started a new tradition with my gf of almost 2 years of taking her out to a nice dinner the night after Christmas. This year was going great until that family showed up. 

We went to a small fancy Italian restaurant around where I live because I knew it wouldnt be busy the day after Christmas. We were the only people in there, sitting in the corner having a candle lit dinner.  We had walked in about 10 minutes before them... thats when it all went bad. The restaurant was dead, so they let them pick where they wanted to sit. It was a mother who had to be at least 55, with two kids, around 12-14, who were both mentally handicapped. Well what do you know, but the seat right next to us looked like the best seat in the world, so the mother walked right over and sat down. Didnt seem so bad. A little intrusive, but I was going to deal with it. My gf didnt see any of this, as she chose the seat that faced the wall. Smart girl

These kids stank to high heaven. They both must have pissed and shit themselves and mellowed in it for a few days. One was much less disabled than the other, and other than being obnoxiously loud and stinky, he was ok. He had table manners and didnt constantly fart and stare like the other one. The one that was more disabled got a meal that came with a salad, so when it came, he started chowing down. Pieces of salad where going everywhere. Some flew over towards our table but never made a full landing. Then he found the ranch.. and thats when it got worse. He started to drool everywhere while eating and never once did he or his mom wipe his mouth. There was white ranchy drool pouring out of his mouth, all over his chin and shirt, and onto the table. The whole time he was eating he was gawking at me. Like full on food in his wide open mouth, staring at me. God it was so disgusting. I know he might not be able to help it, but his mom just sat there and didnt do anything about it. They both kept making weird awkward noises and must have had a fart contest going. 

Then it was time for the entrees. He got some pasta thing, and I got pizza, which this particular restaurant is famous statewide for. The kid started crying so hard that he didnt get pizza and he wanted mine. He was crying like he just watched someone run his dog over. He had huge nasty snot bubbles and drool and ranch and something else was pouring out of his mouth again. At this point, my gf finally turned around and saw what I had been looking at. She completely lost her appetite and we had just gotten our food. She didnt even take one bite. At this point, the mom just continued to sit there and then the other kid started screaming for pizza too. I had enough, so both decided to get to go boxes and leave. 
The waiter mouthed ""Im sorry"" to us as we left. I mouthed it right back because he was the one who had to clean up their mess when they left... 

My gf is lucky I have a strong stomach, because anyone else seeing that wold have gotten queezy. Call me messed up, rude, asshole, whatever you want, but they completely ruined the dinner for me and my gf.",,False,,t5_2ranw,False,,,True,t3_15jdw7,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15jdw7/you_might_hate_me_for_this_but/,

Anyone else.,boiled-jeans,316,57,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/19ib5t/anyone_but_her_for_the_love_of_god_anyone_else/,"Okay. I need to say these things so that I can try to think of other things when I hang out with friends tomorrow night.

Six years together.

The weekend you left me home alone and throwing up on the couch was the weekend you met her. I remember waking up in the morning and seeing all the photos on facebook. Your arm was around her in every single one. I thought that was weird. It made me uncomfortable.

After everything you had put me through in the past, I had learned to trust you COMPLETELY. I forgave you COMPLETELY. When you assured me that this was nothing, that she was just a friend of the family, I believed you. Completely.

The next two weekends, you found ways to get away from me. You ignored my calls when I had planned to meet you and your friends after my evening exam. Once again, I logged onto facebook after a night alone to find pictures of you with her. And again the next weekend. 

I knew what was happening. But I thought it was just like every other time. I thought you just needed to know that you could still get girls to want you.

I did my hair. I wasted an obscene amount of money on clothes. I cried. You told me you loved me. You told me you wanted to grow old with me. I looked at the photos over and over and over. 

For the next month you let me believe that that was it. You had gotten that feeling of being desired that you needed, and we could go back to normal. Go back to being best friends. I curled up in your lap while you played video games. You became secretive. Your eyes were constantly on your phone. I felt so fucking alone. I felt like I was drowning. I still do.

And then you told me maybe things would get better if we took a week or two apart. Maybe I should stay with my mom just for now, right? The FIRST NIGHT I stayed at my mom's, you had her over, you had her as your new girlfriend. She had been your new girlfriend for the past month. You had just been waiting to stumble across a cowardly excuse to get rid of me.

It's been six months. You two have a new house together. After six years with you, we shared most of the same friends. All of whom adore her. I've never been so alone in my life. 

The thing is, I can handle being dumped. I am over YOU. I am aware of what you are. I have gotten to know and love myself more than ever over the last six months. I can take the cowardly breakup. I can take the cheating. I can take it.

But I can not handle the fact that it's her. That month, my world came crashing down. I lost myself. I lost my love and my home and my best friend. I can't describe the loneliness. The worthlessness. WHY THE FUCK DOES IT HAVE TO BE HER? I would rather be dumped for my own mother. For my father. For my dog. For Kristen. For Jessica Biel. Fucking anyone but Katie. Please.

Every second of every day is a living hell. I am struggling, drowning, clawing, groping, grasping, screaming for a way out of this god damn nightmare. Anyone but her. Why her? I picture you fucking her. She never even considered me a human being. She told me she knew what I was going through. That fucking cunt has no idea what this is like

Six god damn years. You were the only person in my life who has ever really known me. My own mother hasn't even come close. I trusted you, I forgave you, I loved you with every cell of my body. And I can handle being thrown away like garbage by the one person who meant anything to me, the one person I trusted with my well-being. But I can not handle the fact that you left me for her.

I just want...anything else but this reality. Every second is worse than the last. I feel like a balloon that should have popped long ago, my skin just stretching and stretching and stretching as I'm filled and filled and filled with this motherfucking misery. I want to pop. I need to explode. I need something to happen. You can't be with her. Not her. 

Fuck me.

Honestly I had been taught at an early age in the church to hold onto your virginity until you are married. That was all good and well until about three years ago when I realized that I was probably not going to be married anytime soon and that I would like to maybe just have sex with someone that I cared about and loved. Well two years later the person I was in love with didn't want to have sex and then he broke up with me. 

So....last night I just drank some wine with a guy that had been interested in me and was super sweet. After quite a few glasses of wine things started to heat up and we moved to the bedroom. I asked if he had a condom and after him asking me if I was sure thats what I wanted. IT. HAPPENED. haha It's so funny because really it was like not a big deal at all! All these years I have been thinking that this one moment would define how I look at relationships and that my first time would be this magnificent thing that you see in the movies. It wasn't like that at all. I honestly would compare it to brushing my teeth, it's just a thing that felt natural and made me feel human. Besides my vagina feeling like someone literally punched it all night, Im pretty sure that having sex is the most natural thing that a human can do. So to all my Virgins out there, there is no wrong or right time to have sex. Just be comfortable with yourself and do what you feel.

When dad left us when I was 5 I was your biggest support. I was five years old and you turned me into your segregate partner for the rest of my childhood. I was loving, supportive, and a âgoodâ daughter because its what you needed me to be.

When dad stopped calling me and talking to me I made myself not care. After all he was the one who hurt us right? I would cook dinners for you since you worked two jobs, I got a job at 15 to help support us. I helped take care of my older and younger sisters. When you started dating dad again I warned you that he wasnât right for you and that he would cause pain. I had rebuilt what little relationship still remained and I knew father was the same man that he had always been. You told me this time would be different. That he was changed and that it would be ok. I knew better at 16 then you did I guess.

When he ruined your credit, destroyed the house I helped you buy and was a major pig in the house you were upset. You did what you felt you had to and ran to the arms of another man. By this time I was 25, had moved out and was married. When you asked if you should leave dad for this other man I told you it wasnât the right way to leave but yes to get out. When my husband and I separated in the middle of a miscarriage and I needed youâ¦ for the first time in my life I needed YOU. I needed you to help me move home because I didnât want to drive across the country into a new apartment alone and bleeding. You were unemployed and living with your new man. I asked you if you would come and you said ok. I bought you a plane ticket and was paying for everything.

What did I tell you? Oh yes. It was what I really needed was my mommy.

You let the new boyfriend (now your husband) talk you out of coming. He needed you didnât he? You had to take care of him and his children didnât you? You didnât have the time to come drive with me. I was an adult and could take care of myself nowâ¦ Right mom? Isnât that what you said? That his 12, 10, 8 and 6 year old needed you more? You were unemployed. 

This was when I learned in my life that the only person I can depend on is ME. ME ALONE. Now that I am back in town and I am turning 28 you cant even see me for our shared birthday. I was your best friend. I am your child and I cant even have a relationship with you because of your new husband. Its devastating that I cant even take you to lunch when I give you a whole week to pick a day. You are unemployed still. You have the time.
Mom, how could you?

Iâm done. Today was the last time I will ever try to have you in my life again. Now I just have to heal the devastation you have brought and move on. I look forward to the day when this doesnât hurt so bad anymore.

When it comes to my younger brother and I, I have always been the ""responsible one"" with an old soul.  I got stellar grades in high school and went to a top 20 college, participated in all kind of clubs and activities, won several accolades along the way, got a great job teaching kids math and science, and did everything I could to make my parents happy and proud.

My brother, on the other hand, was a poor student, did all kinds of drinking and drugs, has been a huge financial drain on my parents (extra years of college, years of unemployment, etc), and after a huge wedding, got divorced a year and a half later.

BUT, he is an athlete, he is very good looking, and he is charismatic.  He can shmooze with just about anyone and they fall in love with him.  I, on the other hand, am the awkward one.  I've been overweight my entire life, I've always been academic and nerdy, and I definitely got the short end of the stick when it comes to good looks.  As my mom once told me as a teenager, ""Your brother will always be able to get by with a flash of his smile - you're always going to have to try harder""

I always have ""tried harder"", and honesty, I'm so happy with the life I've built for myself.  I'm married to an incredible man who I adore but my family will never get, as he's reserved and not outgoing and social like the rest of my clan.  I have a great house, a great career that my dad doesn't respect (he thinks teachers are lazy, whiny  folks who abuse the system to get great pensions and benefits), and a great circle of supportive friends.

Last night everyone was drinking at a family event.  Someone asked my mom who her favorite child was, and she made it clear that it was my brother.  They're both cut from that same highly social, charismatic cloth and I should understand that.  But damn, it still hurts when I'm the child who's done everything right by the book.  I'm the one who's never gotten arrested, never broken my jaw because I got in a fight at a bar, never sexually abused someone, never drained money from my parents (who are well-off and can afford it), and have never dragged my folks through the emotional ups and downs that he has.  He's still unemployed but has matured a bit in his 20's and is dating a charming girl who can support him financially, and as my mom now loves to say ""He drove me nuts growing up, but now I can see he was worth it"".  I've really never gotten so much as a ""We're really proud of her"" or ""She's really made something for herself"".  I think it's always just been expected of me and taken for granted, but that's what happens when you're not the chick squawking the mostly loudly in the nest, I guess.

I think my next move is to distance myself more and more from my family.  I'll still see them throughout the year as my extended family is always having social events and get togethers, but the three of them (parents &amp; brother) are doing nothing to help my self esteem and sense of worth.  I just need to live the life that I've chosen, forget about how they view/judge me, and be the more nerdy, awkward child that I am without worrying about how much I'm pleasing them.

I told him that the guy was kind of like a boyfriend, but that we didnt really do anything... but he came in when I wasn't home and when I got here it looked like he was hurting Suzy. 

He was really mad that I didn't tell him before.  But he didn't yell at me. he just hugged me and said he was sorry i was all alone at home so much and that we would figure out what to do.

after that we took her to the vet and he said that her infection was clearing up. My dad made me tell him what happened and the vet checked her again and said that before when we brought her in she was kind of swelled and red but he didnt think that she was actually raped. He said that there wasnt anything to make him think she was penetrated. It didnt look like there was any damage inside of her, but still he was really concerned and checked her really good. she was bruised at her tail so he thinks that the guy grabbed her by the tail and hurt it most and that is why she is so snappy. we took x-rays to see if her tail had any broken bones but it was just sprained. He is going to back us up though becase even if it wasnt full on rape, it was still abuse.

so, yeah, i guess maybe he wasnt balls deep in her.  but still, seriously fucked up even just with his pants down ""pretending"". 

anyway, my dad is going tomorrow to talk to the guys parents and he said we will treat it as a sick joke gone wrong if they will agree to send him to counseling. i know everybody wants me to have him arrested but my dad doesnt think that we can really push it unless she was really hurt down there by him. but if they want to ignore it he will talk to someone at school and see what we can do because even if it was a weird joke it isnt funny and he did hurt her. then we will go to the police if it is necessary.

i wish now that i told my dad earlier. he told me i was his little girl and that i didnt ask for this and that he would always be here for me. he was proud of me for not doing anything with him and keeping my promise to not have sex before marriage. having a guy friend over without telling him alone didnt break that promise so he would let it slide this time, but now i must see how dangerous it can be. 
i am just really sorry now.

thank you everybody who was supportive in the other thread. i want to promise i will update again but i don't know how long it will be. anyway it is 5am now and i really need to go to sleep.

I have had them ever since I started experiencing rapid weight gain in middle school. I had one group of guys in the hallway at school ask me what size bra I wore then laugh in my face. One guy in my history class asked me if I watched Seinfeld and knew what a ""bro"" was, because I needed one. One guy was my secret Santa and got me a bra as my gift.

In adulthood, the teasing calmed down, but I can remember two people (one of them a guy who wanted my girlfriend, the other a woman I had once turned down for sex) telling me my tits were huge, or could tell when people were looking at my chest.

I finally had surgery and the boobs are gone - I am now a flat chested man. For the first time in years, I went out with nothing but a t-shirt (and pants) on. I felt weird at first, but then I saw myself and I just .... stopped. I felt so confident, I felt so manly, and it's like this shroud of feeling self-conscious just cleared out, like someone dusting away all the cobwebs.

This is amazing. All my life I have been so self-conscious at all times, I've even had nightmares about my (former) man boobs. I knew I was going to feel better about myself afterwards, but this is amazing - I feel like a brand new person, like I can do or conquer anything.

Edit for a little clarification, I know that this is a sore spot for a lot of people. The computer was turned over to the police, the investigation lasted months. The detective informed us that the volunteer who handles cracking the hard drives of suspected pedophiles is swamped and overworked. The program we installed to document his activity was apparently, not sufficient, among other excuses. We now have the tower and will be picking up the police report. Our next step is the FBI or Centers. I am going to wait until after the wedding so I can devote all resources to assisting and make sure they have EVERYTHING I can possibly provide them.

I don't want her to get out.  I don't think she deserves to be out.  She's a murderer and doesn't seem to feel a damned bit of remorse.  She's not a better person.  If anything, she's a worse person.

She says she wants me to come visit her.  She says she's not going to be in forever.  She says she wants to have a relationship with me.

I'll tell you why she wants a relationship with me.  It's to satisfy her own selfish desires.  She wants ME to want to have a relationship with HER.  She wants me to need her because she's a sociopathic bitch.  Despite going through foster care and having little/no support through college, I made it through a bachelor's degree at a difficult university.  The rest of my family more or less fell apart after my mother and step-father went to prison.  I am the only one who is doing anything halfway decent with my life instead of wallowing in the past.  If I want a relationship with her, it validates her.  She doesn't want to care for me or support me as a mother, she wants ME to care for HER.

I'm sick of the requests for money.  I'm sick of her not going to counseling or doing anything to better herself.  I'm sick of her asking me to write her little prison fuckbuddies (despite the fact that she's still married to my step-dad, who is also in prison, so they are unable to divorce).  I'm sick of her ignoring what I write in my letters.  I'm sick of her pretending that I'm still seven years old and hanging on her word and approval.  

Why, after 15 years of her treating my family like garbage, her murdering my adopted brother, and 10 years of her acting like a cunt even from prison, do I not feel like I have a ""reason"" to cut her out of my life?

HOLY FUCK GET OVER YOURSELVES. Seriously every other day there is a post being like OMG my girlfriend has a sexual past, what do I do? You grow the fuck up. Seriously it is not fucking Victorian England. I have NEVER ONCE seen a post about a girl saying that she was uncomfortable with her boyfriend's sexual history. And let's be honest, though not all guys are constantly looking to score, there are many, many guys (PUAs, if you will) who try to have as much sex as possible. That's not to say posts with girls uncomfortable about their boyfriend's past don't happen, but they happen MUCH, MUCH more commonly with the roles reversed.

Usually the advice is pretty solid, saying ""Dude grow up you are both adults and she didn't cheat on you, what's the problem"" but also there are people saying ""Oh well the number of people she has had sex with is usually a pretty good indicator that she has a bad moral character and will cheat on you so yeah break up"". I think that is bullshit. Sometimes people have high sex drives but don't want a relationship or don't have time for one, as long as they are safe and don't get pregnant or spread STDs then WHO CARES. Jesus. If she cheats on you then she's a cheater, but JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE LIKES SEX DOESN'T MEAN THEY'LL CHEAT ON YOU HOLY SHIT

Often times these posts give the ages of the girl between 25-30 and they are like OMG 30 PARTNERS THAT'S SOME GOLD STAR SLUTBAG MATERIAL

Alright, let's do the math: say they start becoming sexually active at age 17. If they have one new partner every 6 months, for a new relationship or whatever, that is already 16 sexual partners by age 25! And that is ONE sexual partner every six months! Say they have a year long relationship, alright that is 15 sexual partners, but then say they have no relationship for a year and  have a 1 night stand every two months for that year, oh shit that's another 6 sexual partners in 1 year! That makes it 21 partners total by age 25! Jesus it sounds like a lot when you say the total number but taking into account the total amount of time she is sexually active, it's not like she's fucking a different dude every weekend!

And, btw...EVEN IF SHE WAS DOING THAT, IT ISN'T A PROBLEM

There are simultaneously so many posts from dudes being like ""OMG my wife/gf never wants to have sex, I always initiate, her sex drive is so low"" vs. ""Wahhhhh she has a more extensive past/ sexual history than I do""

Motherfuckers you can't have it both ways!!!! Did you just expect her to sit in a room quietly until you came along to fulfill her every need? NO! Vibrators can only go so far! If you want a girlfriend that wants to have sex with you all the time and has a high sex drive, chances are this sex drive didn't MAGICALLY appear as soon as she started dating you! As long as she was not in a committed relationship and had safe and protected sex, her number of partners has ZERO reflection on her ability to remain monogamous and her moral character! It simply means SHE LIKES SEX. IF YOU LIKE SEX TOO AND WANT A LOT OF SEX, THIS SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM

Just this idea guys have that girls are pure and untouched and innocent before they come along to ""educate"" them is fucking ridiculous. It honestly disgusts me.

For pretty much my entire life, my older sister has had a psychological hold on me that has ruined every chance I have had at being happy. Starting when I was very little (toddler), she would sexually asault me and make me touch her. She was bigger than me and would hurt me if I made her mad. She'd even bring over her two friends to help her molest me, and then tell me that they hated me and I had to do what she said or they wouldn't want to play with me anymore and I would have no one.

Our parents were having a lot of isses when I was growing up (my dad was cheating, my mom was depressed) and my mother often took things out on me with physical and verbal abuse. My dad avoided us all together and used to spend days at a time with his mistresses to escape the stress of my mother complaining about how horrible I was. My sister used this stuff to manipulate me. She told me that I needed her because my parents hated me. She'd make me think I was unlovable and I should feel thankful that she spent time with me. If I didn't do what she wanted me to, she would threaten to abandon me and I would have no protection from my mother.

She told me that my friends hated me too. She would say things like ""you think they like you? Those girls hate you. I had to beg them to play with you. If it weren't for me, they would never spend time with you"". She created this sick dependence that totally warped my mind. I thought I was unlovable and awful. I thought that I had to let people use my body because that was all I had to offer and they would hate me otherwise.

As I grew older, she would tell me who I could date, what I could wear, when I could drink, and what drugs I could use. She painted all of my family (extended and immediate) as the enemy and convinced me to cut all ties with them. She isolated me and made me think that she was all I had. She stopped touching my when I entered middle school but she would use her sexuality to upset me for fun. I think she knew that I had PTSD from her abuse. She would wait until I fell asleep and brought guys into the room and have sex right next to me, often knowing that it was waking me up but I was too traumatized to do anything about it. She would bring her boyfriends into our living room while I would be watching tv and start to fool around and have sex with them next to me on the couch. She would tell me details about her sex life with this evil smirk, speaking louder when I begged her to not make me listen. She would grab and touch me randomly, holding tighter when I struggled but then playing it off like I was being a ridiculous brat for getting upset. 

All through my teens, she would try to shame me about everything she could. When my friend died and I sought therapy, she berated me for hours and told me that I was pathetic and I couldn't actually need it. She said I was trying to get attention and it was immature. She tried to make me think I was a slut whenever I talked to a guy, but a social recluse and a freak if I wasn't having sex. She has tortured me for years and I can't take it any more. I can't look at her without having flashbacks. I now recognize that she is a very sick person and has used me throughout the years to feel powerful and that she just makes me feel awful because that is how she feels and it makes her feel better. 

She moved out for a couple years and I really started to get healthy. I messed up in school pretty badly because of the depression and ptsd but I'm trying to get a college degree and make something out of myself. A little over a year ago, she moved back home. She is my mother's favorite and is living with us rent free, and she is totally irresponsible and immature so I know that she'll milk that for as long as possible. When she moved back, I started to do poorly in my courses. I'm living at home, going to a community college. I can't afford to move out and don't even have any kind of college fund, so I don't know how to get out. I've stopped going to school because I know something has to change before I can focus enough to do well. I'm working two jobs and barely paying my bills. I'm actually in a good amount of debt. I don't know what to do.

I have this deep, burning anger that has been there my whole life but now that I understand who it should be directed at, I'm going a little mad. Every day, I just think about how much better I would feel if I could just stab her a hundred times, cover her in gasoline, and burn the house down with her body inside. I dream about doing it, and I just want more than anything for her to die. I hope every time she leaves the house that she gets raped and murdered. I can't stand feeling her presence anymore. The first night she was back, I sat on the floor having a violent panic attack until the sun came up. I cried and gasped for breath for hours, feeling her fingers grope and force their way inside me. I just wanted to take a knife from the kitchen and plunge it into her while she slept.

I really don't know what to do at this point. My illness is keeping me from having a good relationship with my boyfriend, friends, family, and myself. I don't think I'm going to kill her (I'm more likely to kill myself, though it would feel like she won). I just want to with every fiber of my being. To see my mom dote on her like she is this precious angel makes me want to vomit. She uses my mom's depression to manipulate her into paying her bills (my parents are poor and struggle to make ends meet) and giving her everything she needs so she can live like a teenager in her mid twenties. I hate seeing it and I can't take it any more. 

Sometimes I think it would be better if I killed her. She is promiscuous and like I mentioned earlier, irresponsible. I know she doesn't always take her birth control and if she lives long enough, I'm sure she'll get pregnant eventually. I would blame myself if she abused her child.

Fuck, I can't even handle my own load right now but I need to help them carry theirs too. 


Life hasn't been the same since we lost you.  Life is hard.  I am doing my best to raise the girls myself but dammit, it's fucking hard.  Sometimes I hate being a single parent.  I hate struggling.  I hate life most of the time.  If not for the kids; I would just quit all together.


I hope you are watching over us.  I'm not sure I believe you can or can't.  I just wish you could be here and be proud beside me.  Our girl dude, she's fucking amazing!  She's so much like you in so many ways.  She walks like you, she sounds like a female you, she looks like you.  She's smart and funny like you.  She's a kick ass artist, just like you were.  So much of you lives on through her but, damn we want you!!!  


I tell her you'd be proud.  I encourage her.  I cheer for her.  I root for her.  I go to bat for her.  I listen and answer her questions.  There's some though man, I don't know how to answer.  Like; how come I don't have him here?  I wonder what life would be if I had a dad like everyone else.  Hurts man.  


Despite everything, this kid whips out straight A's...your smarts for sure, certainly not from my side of the gene pool.  She is in 7th grade now and so advanced.  She is on the principal list for 4.0 GPA, she is in several scholars programs.  She is in the gifted and talented program.  She is in some pre-college courses now...all at 12 years old.  Fucking amazing is what she is.  Thank you!  


Life is hard.  Money is tight.  I know we wouldn't be in this spot if you were here.  You always said 'if anything ever happened to me; I wouldn't worry I know you'll hold it down' pffft...fucking fail.  



Anyways, I'm sitting here listening to old school jams we used to bang to together.  I miss you so much still.  I don't think that will ever change.  I sit and wonder like our girl; what would our life be like if you hadn't of died.  I want our happy ever after we were striving for.  


After school we will write a note and put it in a balloon for you like we have every year on your birthday, Christmas and the anniversary of you passing away.  I will put them in red balloons and send them up in the sky.  I will do my best not to be sad and depressed; I know you hated times when I was like that.  I will together with the kids celebrate your birthday for you since you can't.   I hope you know how much and deep you are loved and missed.  You may be gone but jesus fuck, you will never ever never be forgotten! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 


TL;DR spend time with your loved ones.  Make sure they feel and know they are loved.  If you haven't said it lately; hearing the words spoken means a lot.  I miss that most.  Enjoy your holidays!!

**[Update](http://redd.it/1k3hz3)**

First, I want to thank everyone who posted with advice and possible scenarios.

This will be my final update, and since I'm exhausted and drained, I don't see it being too long. Please keep in mind that I'm leaving out a good amount of little details because of that.

I called her today, and confronted her about it. I gave her a single piece of evidence (if you want to call it that) at a time, listened to her reply, then debunked it quickly. I *did* setup the questions in a way to favor certain responses, so I could have something ready. After everything was presented, she stuck to saying that she was where she said she was. 

She quickly (which I expected) tried to turn it around on me. About how she couldn't believe that I didn't trust her over all these years. Which isn't true. I blindly trusted her, and never had a reason not to. I never snooped, or dug for anything. I was never really jealous, etc. I didn't do anything until these enormous red flags. 

She started playing out these ""what if"" scenarios. Saying that if she were at the other state, it would be because there was a trial there (which could be true, there are a could BIG cancer places in that city), and that if she wanted to go there, that I would have a problem with it because the guy was there, too. I told her that if she were upfront about it, I would have explained my worries, but would have completely understood and encouraged her to go despite my uneasy feelings about it.

Finally, she told me she was in fact there, and she did go to a trial there. That she lied about it because I would immediately assume she went there to cheat. She was really pissed, telling me she was going to go (as in hang up), and pretty much breaking up with me while blaming me for snooping. It has been a few hours, and I haven't heard anything from her, and I haven't tried to contact her.

The only thing I ask is that people refrain from the reddit default responses of ""fuck that bitch"" ""what a whore"" ""stupid cunt"". It is what it is. I don't know if she cheated, and probably will never know, *but* she lied, and she lied in a huge way. There would be no way of building trust back up after this, so that's the end.

Anyway, thanks again to everyone who left the kind PMs to me, and the replies.


**Edit:** 6 hours later, and it has finally hit me. I could go for a drink. :(

Thanks for all the kind words, everyone. I normally take the time to respond to each one, but I'm just so lost.

I just don't understand how you can have such little logic.

Today I was tasked with damage control and the complaints are so stupid and pathetic I really don't understand how these people can function.

_

*""I had to line up for 2 hours to get on x ride""*

We don't force you to get in that line. We don't allocate 2000 people at any given time to that ride. YOU. YOU, the guests, create the lines. With 14,000 people on the premises you're going to have to line up at one point and the more people there are the longer the lines will be.

*""My boyfriend is only an XL but was too big to fit in your rides. Now he's embarrassed and our day was ruined.""*

He was bigger than an XL. We have special ""fat seats"" for people. Don't blame us for your boyfriend being a fatass.

*""We had to pay $10 for the parking lot!""*

You're paying for all day parking. That's 9am-6pm. $10 is a fair price. Most day rates are $10, stop complaining.

*""I wanted to buy a fast pass but they were sold out!""*

We can only sell 400 a day. If everybody had a line skip ticket it wouldn't be a line skip anymore.

*""It's $120 for a fast pass! What a rip off""*

No, it's $120 for a fast pass that allows you unlimited rides on every ride in the park all day. A fast pass for ONE ride is $10 or $15 for 3, seriously learn to read.

*""My kids weren't tall enough to go on anything""*

I'm sure you own a measuring tape at home. All our height restrictions are available online before you come, is it really so hard to check your kid's height before you drive 4 hours to us and ruin their day by disappointing them?

*""There was nowhere good to eat""*

We don't have a McDonalds, KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell or whatever chain you want. A burger from our grill stops tastes just as good, stop bitching.

*""There were several gypsy families visiting this day, you should have warned the public""*

Yes, because we can issue a warning when we know large numbers of certain social/ethnic groups are coming. Do you have any idea how many laws that breaks?  Hey, guys, please don't come today we're expecting a lot of black people. Sorry, please stay away today, we've got a bunch of French school kids. It's illegal and discriminatory.

*""There are no prices on the food carts so you have to pay high prices  because you don't know what you'd ordered""*

Now this is just laziness. I saw it all the time when I was a cart-slinger. It is illegal to not display the prices, you are just too lazy to look for more than half a second. Oh, I was too lazy to look to the left of my immediate vision where the prices are displayed, OBVIOUSLY THERE IS NO PRICE, WHAT A RIP OFF!

*""What do you mean prices for limited time extra attractions go up at peak times?!""*

Just seriously? That's how nearly everything works.

Now I'm not defending my company. They are a bunch of money grabbing buttfucks who force their workers to aggressively sell from the second you set foot in the park but most of these are common sense and they're too stupid to realise it. 

Obviously we're not allowed to say this to their faces but I just wanted to get this off my chest and thought it didn't fit in with any of the other subreddits.

You live four hours away so how can you possibly know what it's like for those two girls to live together? You only hear the worst of it because you're daughter's selective about that she complains about and is used to getting what she wants after she complains to mommy.

But you know what? You're right; my girlfriend should apologise. On her behalf, let me do it for her. I'm sorry she cleans the sauce stains from the microwave because your daughter can't cover her food. I'm sorry she mops the floor, wiping off the chocolate milk stains your daughter's boyfriend left on the floor for three days. I'm sorry she's bought her own pots and pans because your daughter's too stupid to know that they rust if you put them in the dishwater. But you're right, my girlfriend's unreasonable. She's a huge germaphobe with an unrealistic standard for clean and I'm sorry she's already made the compromise to lower them while she lives with your daughter.

But the thing I can't get over is the fact you've had the gall to accuse my girlfriend of being lazy and doing nothing around the house. You think your daughter's special because she takes a summer course ONLINE and works two jobs? My girlfriend is taking the equivalent of 1.5 credits this summer, is going to school 18 hours a week (more than during the regular school year, mind you) AND, since one of these courses is a language course, she's trying to learn a new language. Don't forget the countless readings, assignments and essays she's had to write. I guess the articles she's been writing for the school newspaper don't count either.

On top of all that, my girlfriend took these classes because she wanted too. She didn't have too, she wanted too. You know why your daughter took her class? Because she failed it during her normal school year. Too busy hooking up with random guys I suppose. But you're right, my girlfriend should be pulling her own weight in the house. Because she obviously has the time to do it.

But know your daughter's gone too far. She's accuse my girlfriend of being a slut because I've spent a couple nights over. You want the truth? Here's the truth: Your daughter's a lying bitch. Since the start of the summer two months ago, I've spent maybe five to seven nights over with my girlfriend. Your daughter, never mind the fact she's been dating her boyfriend for less than two months, has had her boyfriend over for a minimum of 15 out of 30 days. And those are the days my girlfriend's been around to count. 

And the worst thing is? You're gonna win. My girlfriend already feels like a stranger in her own home. And, by bringing me into this (which you had no right of doing), she's now considering terminating the lease and finding another house. But you know what? I hope she does; I hope she and her best friend can find some place to move in together and be rid of your bitch of a daughter because the moment my girlfriend moves out of that house, that house is going to fall apart. For the first time in her life, she'll have responsibilities and she'll have to take care of the place by herself.

Oh wait, she'll probably call you, bitch about the neighbors who share the second apartment, and you'll come and pick up all her messes. Because she's mommy's little girl who always gets what she fucking wants.

It seems like the evidence that blacks are more 'primitive' and more 'violent' is just piling up. Every other video of someone committing a crime or doing something stupid on camera is done by a black person. The crime statistics show that blacks are the minority, yet commit the most crimes. IQ's show that blacks are by far the least intelligent out of all races. And subreddit's such as /r/bestofworldstar and /r/niggers help pile evidence to prove them. With all this, there has definitely been an increase on black hate. Especially over the 3-4 months.

And to be honest, it's scaring me. As a black person who has done little wrong in his life and tries to be a good human being, I have never felt so alone and useless. It's getting to the point where I feel paranoid walking in the streets incase people think of me like this. I often wonder why all races have progressed, but blacks in Africa haven't. Why blacks rely so much on the Americans, Europeans, and East Asians (to an extent) to lead good lives. Why blacks have contributed so little for science and and the progression of humanity.

I've been awake for a little over 24 hours, so if you have walloftextphobia, this is your exit cue. My phone died while I was at work last night (cooking in a bar). I stayed and drank for a while after my shift, and plugged my phone in around 4:30 in the morning as I'm getting ready to fall asleep. As soon as my phone comes back on, I see a new voicemail, and cryptic, super serious texts from my brother and my sister, telling me to call my dad. The voicemail is from my dad, telling me to call him when I get a chance. My dad is not one for social calls, so my mind is racing and trying to deduce who died or was hospitalized. I wasn't going to get in touch with anyone at that time in the morning, so I sat around for several hours just hoping that it wasn't my mom, since she was the only one I hadn't heard from.

7:30ish rolls around and I call my brother, who tells me that my aunt had a heart attack and died Monday evening.  He says our parents are pretty broken up about it, I can't sleep at this point, and I'm honestly just relieved that my mom's okay, so I hopped a bus down to her house, where I'm informed that I have 2 cousins I've never met. My aunt lived several states away and made sporadic appearances over the years. She worked for the Dept. of Agriculture, and most major holidays there would be some last-second work emergency that would keep her from visiting. The running joke was that she worked for the CIA, but the more serious theory that I never heard when I was younger was that she married a black guy. I have no problem with that, but my grandpop was a good ol' boy from Georgia. In the case of my dad and my uncle, the apple didn't fall too far from the tree. Take from that what you will. Turns out that theory was pretty spot on, and furthermore, they had 2 girls together. One of them is a year or two younger than me.

More pieces of the story are coming out by the hour and I'm really conflicted about the whole thing. I want to meet this part of my family that's been hidden from me my entire life. I'd like to be there for them, but I'm just some guy, or so I'd imagine. There are so many skeletons in my family's closet that I was blissfully ignorant of when I was younger. I have so many questions, but I have to remember that these people lost a wife and mother while I lost an Aunt who, while I loved her very much, wasn't exactly a constant presence in my life. I have no idea how the next week is going to play out, and I'm still trying to process everything I've learned in the last few hours.

I have a friend who works with me, and he is generally not treated right.  He is sorta overbearing, tries really hard, that kind of thing. but he means well, he has a really pure heart.

He doesnt ""look cool"".  his life has been hard, his mom died in childbirth and he was born premature.  He is 21, but looks 15. 
anyways, this sweet guy is looking for love.  He talks to me about the sites that he's on to meet people, and i encourage him, cause this guy deserves it. 

Yesterday he was ecstatic, he kept buggin me to come over and talk to him throughout the day, i didnt have time until the end of my shift. so when i get over there he tells me how a reallllllly hot girl started talking to him, and shes being really nice and they talked for 3 hours.

He tells me he gets her number, and that they are going to a restaurant tonight.  an expensive nice restaurant, that her parents own. im like, wow nice man! sounds fun! he says that they'll be getting free drinks and food and im happy for the guy.  I wasnt even considering that she could be lieing.
my phone dies that night, i wake up and he texts me 

""that was bad. her parents didnt own the restaurant, she left me and i had to pay 175 dollars. im walking home""

god fucking damn her.

this kid IS SWEET AS FUCK. he is the nicest kid. he has been dealt a shit hand in life and this animal took advantage of him. 

and that doesnt even describe what she did. she hurt this guy. he is lonely and so careful to never offend people, so unsure of himself. and this girl played him. He 

for fucks sake. 

I dont wanna share this with people that know him because it is tearing me up inside and it'll do the same to them. i needed to tell someone though.

for anyone who will be saying ""he shouldve seen the signs"" or that bs, i dont wanna hear it. this guy doesnt operate on most peoples level.  im not saying he is mentally ill, but his life and lack of confidence have led him to be..just different.

The piece sold for $86,882,500 at Christies auction house nearly a year ago today. I do not understand art.""

Posted with this link: http://i.imgur.com/lHnCMjS.jpg

I hope I'm okay to do this here on this sub-reddit, but I'll accept that I may get down-voted to oblivion.  I get really sick of the anti-art rhetoric that comes out on about a bi-monthly basis on Reddit. I love you guys around here, and I love the things Reddit does for the world, but the attitude of belligerence and (seemingly) deliberate misunderstanding of works of art is pretty annoying.

Here's the deal (he says, trying not to be a shitlord): people on Reddit are looking at these artworks on the internet. Wait, wait: people on Reddit are (most often) looking at PHOTOGRAPHS of these works on the internet. When you're looking at works like Rothko's and Pollock's and Judd's, and any of the other artists who get regularly shit upon by Redditors through a computer screen, you are not getting the full effect of the work, and the judgement of the simplicity of these works as being not worth the time or effort of these artists is philistine and really unfair. 

Why it matters so much to me?  I'm an artist. I consider it my job to dive as thoroughly as I can into my aesthetic interests and understanding of the world. And when I see works as compelling as the one pictured being dragged through the mud on judgements made without the full story, I get real fucking sick of it.  Especially when (and, yeah, this is a form of elitism) part of pursuing your aesthetic voice may be going places people don't appreciate or understand.

The big fat caveat one: yes, the art market is bullshit. Rothko's work and others' are collected by people who don't understand or even look at them. Fuck, they may not like what they are looking at.  But people have to learn to get back to what the works were originally about: the experience of the human body in the presence of these canvases. Putting works the subject of which is this bodily interaction into the internet to be consumed as a down-scaled image on a screen simply doesn't work the same way.

Big fat caveat two: I'm new to Reddit, and hope I'm not putting this in the wrong place. And I'm hammered, so I'm convinced I should try and make a point on the internet.

It's not because you're ""nice"", it's because if you're a fucking douche that not happy about being my friend, and makes yourself some sort of victim just because I don't want to have sex with you, THAT'S why.",horseniss,317,88,177,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1aj6be/so_youre_wondering_why_youre_being_friendzoned/,"Seriously guys - do you know who the douches are? The douches are not the guys that have tattoos and are ""popular"". 

No, the fucking douches are you - ""nice guys"". Just because you never had a female friend in your whole life, you are absolutley sure I want to fuck with you or become your girlfriend just because I talk to you. 

Seriously, if I friendzone you just because I don't want to be more than friends with you, I'm technically friendzoning over 7 billion people right now. Are you even realizing yourself how stupid this sounds? Am I friendzoning exactly every guy I ever talked to in my whole life except my exboyfriend?

Also one thing else that pisses me off is how all ""ugly"" guys ***ONLY*** goes after the hottest girls, and makes comment like *""All girls just want to date badguys, why doesn't any girl want to be with me? She should ignore the fact that I'm ugly and instead see what a nice guy I am!""* 

The funny thing is that, every guy who has this opinion ONLY looks for the hot girls and want the hot girls to  be with them even if they're ""ugly"". **To you guys who does this: Do you have ANY clue how many other girls there are out there, who wants nothing more than a boyfriend? Girls that YOU (the ""nice guy"") haven't even looked at because they're ""ugly"" or ""weird"" or ""fat"". Did you know that? Of course you don't know! Because just as the ""hot girls"" are obsessed with hot guys and doesn't notice you, *you* are obsessed with hot girls and doesn't notice rest of the girls.**

The douchiest guys I've met in my life are ALWAYS the ones that consider themself ""the poor nice guys"". Yes, exactly, you heard me. I grew up as only girl in a group of boys, I've spent all my life being friend with only guys, I've never had many female friends and I'm used to being ""one of the guys"". I have guy-ish interests, games etc, and I'm well, just used to being ""one of them"" when we hang out.

But I don't look like a tomboy, I'm always wearing cute dresses and heels and I'm, if I'm allowed to say it myself, pretty cute and totally OK attractive. So, whenever I meet new guys, the ones you ""nice guys"" describes as the ""douchbags"", (or as they were in highschool or collage, the popular guys) most of them just accept me as one of their friends. Yes, they might try to hit on me. And yes, they will probably fail. And *yes*, they will be okay with it, and still hang out with me. They're all used to having female friends.

But what happens when I meet you ""nice guys""? Do you find me as an equal to one of your male friends? **NO**, you don't. You all look down on me. You all make comments and try to make me into a little girl. If I mention a game a like, you correct me and tells me I'm wrong and just take for granted that I'm a total noob that doesn't know anything (*funny thing how you're all obsessed with gamergirls here on internet, but just noob:ifies them when you meet one...*). And do you introduce me to the rest of your friends and do NORMAL FUCKING FRIENDLY STUFF WITH ME? No. No you don't. Because you see me as a *girl* and nothing else. Like I'm not a human being, I'm a vagina on two legs and nothing more. I'm either your girlfriend or the meanest bitch ever. 

Do you know how much it hurts me, when I'm in a new group of people who learn to know each other, and happen to be the only girl, and EEEVERYONE of you asks me out, but then I finds out that just the day before you were all hanging out and drinking - without inviting me? If you can't accept me into your life like a normal human being, I'M NOT GOING TO FUCKING DATE YOU.

And if we say I *would* start to date one of this group guys, do you know how much it hurts me when you STILL don't invite me to meet up with the other guys? I DON'T like when I'm on a date with Guy A on a friday, and then on sunday finds out that saturday evening both A, B, C, D and E hanged out with each other without inviting me. No, I won't fucking date you again if you do this.

This happens all the fucking time. Stop making me different just because I happened to be born the other gender. If it wouldn't be for the fact that I love pink dresses I would be a transexual without any doubt, just to get rid of all these fucking prejudices. 

And also, all this ""*This douchbag just want's your pussy, therefore you should sleep with me instead of him*"" - I don't even have to get into how stupid this is, I think you can realize that yourself. Also, I would MUCH rather hang out with, or date, or whatever, with a guy who **treats me like a normal human being and includes me in his life and wants to be my friend, that then talks about my ass behind my back (lol no pun intended), than hanging out with YOU, who *also* talks about my ass behind my back (even if you're of course the ""nice guy"") but doesn't include me shit in your life.**

Sorry for ranting. If you were me, you would understand. Hope some ""nice guy"" reads this and realizes what his doing so we can put a fucking end to this motherfucking ""i'm-getting-friendzoned-i'm-such-a-victim"" hype that's been going on for some years.


**TL;DR: Nice guys are in 99% of the cases the real douches. Treat a girl like normal human being and not a walking vagina.**

1375194652.0,228,self.offmychest,1jcln2,Today I witnessed the worst child abuse I have ever seen. I did what i could... I hope that she is okay.,Tamyu,254,26,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jcln2/today_i_witnessed_the_worst_child_abuse_i_have/,"This was such a terribly traumatic event that I need to type it out somewhere. I don't think I could have done anything else. I just need to get it out.

Today, I parked in a shopping center parking lot because the lot right by my client's office was full. I have parked there before, so parked in the back corner nearest the stairs to take me out of a side exit near the office. That part of the lot was almost empty. It was the roof lot, and in the small stair entrance (where it was blistering hot, the aircon doesn't really reach up there) a well dressed woman was sitting on a bench with a little girl maybe around 6 or 7 basically squatting on the floor doing some homework looking thing. The woman kept yelling at her and bent over to slap her several times as I passed. She was basically yelling at her to do it right, why couldn't she write it right, if she didn't hurry up and finish she would leave her there, and so on. It gave me a bad taste in my mouth, but I just sort of hurried by and wondered why on earth they were there...

Fast forward about an hour and a half. I am done with the meeting and head home. I do a little shopping and head to the car. The mother and child are gone from the top of the stairs, and I head out to my car. There is one other car in that corner of the lot, parked about two rows away, pretty much straight in front of me. The same woman is there screaming at the little girl, who I presumed was in the car because I couldn't see her. And when I say screaming, I mean hysterical screaming. And I could hear the little girl just crying and crying. I didn't know what to do. I just kind of stood there and considered the options - I took down the plate number, and debated calling the police or just going down to the shopping center security...

And then the woman hopped in the car, lurched forward, backed so suddenly the car screeched, then flew out of the lot. The little girl's notebooks and what looked like school papers were just laying there on the ground and sort of flying about. I got in my car and drove slowly over past... And the little girl was curled up on the ground between the parking blocks.

I stopped the car, jumped out, and saw she was bloody. And just laying there. Not moving. I couldn't tell if she was breathing at all. I called out to her and she started moving a little bit. Another car was pulling around the lot and I jumped up and started waving and screaming for them. An older guy jumped out, saw the little girl, starting freaking out with me and asking what happened. Then the little girl started to get up, and starting crying for mommy.

The guy scooped her up and we basically ran inside and down the escalator. She had little bloody holes all over her arms. It looked like she had been stabbed by a pencil or a pen. All over her hands and arms. She had blood coming out of her nose and mouth and had black eyes... And was crying for her mommy. She kept saying ""it doesn't hurt, I'm okay, it was my fault, I was stupid, mommy mommy, I'm sorry I'm sorry"" Over and over again. We went to the first shop at the bottom of the stairs and they called security, and covered her in a big towel. 

The police came first then an ambulance, and they took her away... But while we were waiting the police were trying to ask her for someone to call, asking her name and if she knew her phone number. She just kept saying the same thing over and over. Until the officer asked if she knew her father's number. Then she started shaking and crying and said ""Don't call daddy. Please don't call daddy. Anybody but daddy. Please please please.""  And they asked, does daddy hit you? Did daddy do this? And she shook her head and said ""Daddy does different things..."" And curled up in a little ball until the ambulance took her away. 

I went with the police to the service area, and we went in the back room and I told them everything I saw. I gave them the license number. The store kept calling for the owner of the car with that number to please come to the service counter.

When I was finished and leaving, the mother was there at the counter and started yelling for them to give her daughter back NOW. And the police walked away with her. 

I went and sat in my car and cried for about ten minutes before I felt like I could drive. I still can't stop shaking when I think about it. I broke down once I got home and told my husband what happened. 

She had all these little stab-like wounds up and down her arms, but still kept crying that it didn't hurt, that she was fine and it was because she was stupid and had messed up. She really thought it was her fault. I think her mom even backed the car into her. 

I still feel sick. I don't know if I will be able to sleep tonight.

I've wanted to for a long time. I can't go through a single day without feeling horrible about my gender. I stare at groups of girls from afar (creepy, yes), not from attraction, but from jealousy. I spend nights crying because I can't be a girl.

On the other hand, I am also extremely privileged. I attend a private school and live in a walled neighborhood in China. My life is easy- I get good grades, I don't have to lift a finger around the house. But I've also seen the poverty almost immediately outside of home and the poor standards of living in my parents' times have been hammered into me, so I feel worthless for crying over such a small problem. I want to be a girl? Big deal, there are people starving. 

I don't even know if I actually want to be a girl. Maybe I only want to be transsexual. Maybe I'm just another self-absorbed attention-seeking teenager who's bored with his rich lifestyle and wants to be special. There are plenty of people who claim to have OCD or Asperger's, what makes me different?

I really, really want to be a girl, but I'm afraid that I'm only trying to justify my self-centeredness.

After smashing my nose last night, I went to my best friend's house to tell him about it. I went home right after I finished with the story. He called me later and told me to come over at 9:00 PM. In the past, he struggled with suicide. He had been cutting for 5 years. I had known him since kindergarten, so I was always there for him. Tonight I didn't know my work schedule, and it turns out that I had to close. I called him apologizing. He didn't pick up. It was 10:00 PM when I got to his house. I jumped up out of my car, and right when I got to the door my heart stopped. I was about to turn the handle and then I hear a gunshot. I was frozen in place. I dropped to my knees and cried. A grown ass man, bawling at a doorstep. I walk into the house, my vision blurred from tears. At the sight of what I saw, I vomited for 5 fucking minutes straight. My best friend, Eddie, had shot himself in the head sitting in my favorite chair. Blood was sprayed all up the wall. Brain and skull hanging from pictures of his wife. I couldn't breathe. I fell over and cried. I knew he had contemplated suicide, and the one time he needed me most, to stop him, I wasn't there. I wasn't fucking there. Then she came home. His wife came home to me bawling in a pool of his blood. I didn't know what to do. She passed out. Dropped right to the floor. I called 911 and cried as they hauled his body away. I'm still shuddering and weeping as I write this. The image of his mouth open wide, his face pale, and the back of his head blown out will always haunt me. I walked in my door and collapsed on the floor. I landed right on my broken nose. Waking up in blood stained pants and a puddle of my own blood. I fucking hate myself for not being there when he needed me most.

She baby-sat me and taught me how to draw. She got me into anime and manga, Pokemon, all sorts of weebish things. She struggled with her sexuality for years, and was there for me when I confessed to having feelings for another girl.  
  
Pop tells me she was on her way to work and was hit head on, at high-speed, by a man who swerved into her lane on a quiet road. Then the pair of them were left there for an hour before her job called my aunt and uncle, telling them she was over an hour late for her shift. My uncle, a veteran fireman, went looking for her. By that point someone had called the scene in, and my dad took the call. When my uncle arrived on scene, his colleagues refused to let him see her: she was dead already.  
  
She was so badly mangled that they had to cut her out of her car...what was left of it. They also reported her as a '20 year old male'. She was extremely butch, so I suppose I can see why they'd say that. The plates were run through the system and that was about when my dad figured out it had something to do with my uncle's family, since the plates came back registered to him.  
  
The other driver is in critical condition. I want to be angry at him, but I can't. I don't know if it really WAS an honest accident. His family is also struggling, most likely, and concerned if he's going to live or die. I don't wish what my family's going through on his own should he pass.  
  
The news reported she hadn't been wearing her seat belt. She was: it was just impossible to tell until they began to cut her free. I saw the pictures and feel morbid for doing so. I don't know if she was alive during that one hour at all or if he instantly killed her. I wonder what she was thinking. I'd seen her a month ago at a gas station, and we exchanged numbers since she'd changed over her phone. We planned to get together, see each other at our family's Christmas Eve dinner. She didn't end up going, so that time at the gas station is what I've got as my last memory of her.  
  
I feel like none of this is real. It cannot be real. I have to work a full day today and I'm hoping it keeps my mind occupied, but I'm also afraid of having a break down right there in front of the cooker or on the phone lines with a customer. Just about everyone in my family has called off work, even my mother, who was never close to my dad's family, and my step-sister, who met my cousin in passing once or twice only.  
  
Jesus Christ, cous, this can't be real. You can't be gone. You just can't be...  
  
**Edit: Thank you to everyone who's contributed here. It's been a really long fucking day. I'm still not sure I fully grasp she's gone, but I'm holding tight to her memory. I'm also getting a tattoo done in her memory, likely something Pokemon related, as that was something we'd bonded over when I was younger. It's going to be a shitty process, but I'll get through it.

I was threatened to be thrown in front of a car or train because ""we don't need anymore white people"" along with some racist statements about my religion and color (though I was just informed that no, calling a white person a cracka isn't racist... then what the fuck is it?) and ignored by cops when we had a problem because we were white so we could pay for it.


I grew up in a goddamned project, i grew up poor, ostracized and tormented. I grew up hating my skin color and only recently accepted the fact I am in fact ""white"". I'm sick of this. If I was born a different race then my experiences would be accepted, but instead, this is just what I deserve right? because of what my same skin color peer's ancestors did? see.... my family wasn't around then, we were in Europe being persecuted because of our religion.

I was looking forwards to a nice family dinner followed by an episode of Sherlock, but no, I get this shit. WHO THE FUCK INVITES THEMSELVES OVER FOR DINNER, ESPECIALLY ON SUNDAY NIGHT????!!!! 

This rage is not coming out of nowhere. This woman has shown up to our house expecting to be fed at least once a week for about six weeks.now. After taking up our time, eating our food, and drinking our wine (and she always insists on having the expensive stuff), she starts giving us what she calls ""friendly advice"", which is really just her pointing out all of our flaws and insecurities. She talks about stuff that is NONE of her business and that she has no real understanding of (family issues is her favorite topic), and that she is really in no position to comment on. This woman really does not have any part of her own life together, she's really the least-qualified person to give any kind of advice.

She always brings her son, who, as I mentioned earlier, is autistic. He's fairly mild, but his mother has coddled him and limited him so much that he's completely dependant on her and never matured past 13 or so. He's 22 now, and doesn't even bother trying to go to college, get a job, or generally try to become even the slightest bit more independant. All he does all day is play video games, and all he talks about is Magic: the Gathering. He's a pretty nice guy, and I tried being friends with him, but neither of us is really interested. His mother seems to have this idea that I would make a perfect wife for her son, and keeps forcing us to spend time together, and is apparently interrogating my mother about me and trying to get her to convince me to marry him and move in! What the hell??!! I was only 17 when this started, and I JUST turned 18 on Friday!! I've only known this guy for 7 months, we've barely spoken, neither of us has ANY interest in the other, he's basically a giant child, and I'm planning on going to college across the country in the fall, but this crazy woman thinks that I'm going to get FUCKING MARRIED AND MOVE INTO HER HOUSE!!!!! And would you like to exactly why this woman thinks this? Would you like to know her thinking behind this belief? Well, apparently she explained it to another of my mom's coworkers, who was nice enough to tell me. Well, warn me really. She thinks I will accept her son because, in her exact words, I am ""too fat to have any other prospects"", and I will gladly give up my dream of being a book editor because I ""will realize that I am only good for being a wife, and that [my] place is at home"". WHAT THE FUCKING FUCKIDDY FUCK??? First off, I am not THAT fat. Yes, I'm pretty big, but I'm not obese or anything, and I am still decently attractive. Second, why does my worth have to be based on how attractive I am? I am also smart, funny, and a kind person. I am worth more than my looks. Third, I haven't even finished high school yet! I am not looking for ""prospects"", and I am NOT planning on getting married anytime soon! Fourth, I am good for more than just being a wife, and my place is certainly not at home! I can have my own fucking life, thank you very much! Plus, I.have a lot more potential than your stunted son. Fifth, what a fucking hypocrite! This woman is ugly as hell, and puts no effort into taking care of herself. I also have no idea where this ""women in the home"" attitude is coming from; she raised three sons by herself and has always worked in some capacity, mostly as a professional in the healthcare management field. She knows exactly how successful and powerful a woman can become with work, since she has achieved it! So why the hell does she think that I can't do the same??

My parents are very nice people, and while they're strong in their own ways, they're kind of pushovers. My mother is a very social person who has never turned down any sort of invitation in her life, and has no idea how to not be open and generous with everybody she meets. My dad is very shy and socially awkward (we think he's got mild Asberger's), and has no idea of how to deal with even normal people, much less this lady. I have a very strict personal code that I hold myself to, and part of that code is always being polite and courteous to everyone, whether they deserve it or not, and always being respectful towards my elders. I have been trying to communicate to this woman that we would appreciate if she would not just invite herself over, and that our lives and schedules do not revolve around her, but I don't think the message got across at all.

When I got home from doing some grocery shopping with my mom, this crazy woman, her son, and her boyfriend (who refuses to even acknowledge my existence or attempt to participate in any conversation with me or any member of my family) were all sitting in my living room. My dad was unsure of how to react, and my sister was hiding in her room. I told my mother that she had to explain to them that we were going to have a family night and that they had to leave, and she said that she would, but she chickened out and started making dinner for them too. I was FURIOUS. It takes a lot to get me angry, but once I am angry, I basically Hulk out. I knew that if I stayed there for another minute, I would do and day some VERY unladylike things, so I grabbed my car keys and left, literally shaking with rage. Of course, they had blocked in my car in the driveway, so I ended up driving across the lawn to get out. 

Tonight, I was going to celebrate my 18th birthday, a major milestone, with the people I love. Instead, I am hanging out in a Whole Foods and posting to Reddit on my phone while a drunk homeless guy hits on me.

I hate that every single ""man"" I've tried to get to know have stabbed me in my back, used me only as a sex object, betrayed me, hurt me to no end, and expect attention from fucking everybody, and everybody loves them just because they're gay and not for their character. I hate waking up every morning knowing that I've told my family about my orientation. I hate how homosexuality is a fad now and everyone thinks it's great and adorable. I hate knowing that for the rest of my life I'm going to be cold and miserable. I hate the fact that I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. I hate having to drown myself in vodka every night to feel numb. I hate when people ask me why I'm single, and if I'm gay or not.

EDIT: Wow, I'm honestly taken aback over the amount of love and genuine, thought-out responses given to me in my time of frustration.

Also, this story is focused on a religious value of me and my family, if I unintentionally offended anyone's religious view I'm so sorry, I don't have the slightest intention of doing so. 


I lived my 18 years in a religious, mainly islamic country. Since I was little I never had any attachment to the religion though, even though my parents tried to raise me as a muslim. Both of them are not too tight on me however, and still gave me chance to explore things I like.

Since I was young I've always had a fascination on dinosaurs and space, so I bought a lot of books about them. I loved every moment of reading them and looking at the picture. These books however, contradicts with what I was taught in the religion. Whatever, I've never had much attachment to the concept anyway. I've decided to help people and do good because i want to help people and do good, not because I want to please God. I kept this atheistic view to myself, because I'm afraid of angering and disappointing my parents (They're not quick to anger and very understanding, nor am I edgy and think they're mean, it's just that the thought of them being disappointed scares me so much). So I kept doing the whole islamic routine for the last 4 years while my heart's not into it.

I knew this couldn't last forever though, this fall I'm going to study abroad to the US, and when my dad said I should always remember what they taught me about the islamic values while I'm abroad, I just couldn't lie and say yes to him anymore. I said nothing and left it at that. I spent the next few months getting depressed about thinking how I should say it and how it would affect our relations in the family. 

Today is the start of the Ramadhan month, and I have to go fasting again with everyone while my heart is not in it. I decided I shouldn't hold it in any longer, this is it. I waited until my parents finished their dawn prayer and enter their room. I told them all about it. How I could never believed in the islam ideology, nor any other religion's on that matter. My dad asked me why, how can I be sure, etc etc. My mom was silent the whole time. We discussed various topics on it. In the end, they're very understanding and supportive about it, said that I should believe what I believe. We hugged, and my dad cried, saying that even though he understands that I have to follow what I believe, he still thinks he failed as a muslim father. My mother cried a little too, but she is very supportive about me believing what I believe (she is originally a christian). I cried a lot of man tears and apologised to them many time, and slept peacefully for the first time in weeks.

And it's not just at certain hours of the day. It's all day long. Do you have a job or do you just happen to get the same days off as I do? Even when I was unemployed it was an all day thing. Sometimes I want you to stomp hard enough to fall through my ceiling so I can make you pay for the damage.

Whenever I'm in the bathroom I hear two dogs whimpering and howling. Do you even let them out? They sound absolutely miserable. They also sound like big dogs. I really hope they're too big to be allowed. Maybe you'll be forced to give your dogs away to people who actually care about their pets.

What's with the screamiggling? Scream-giggling. It sounds like there are at least three of you up there just laughing and then screaming like you're riding a rollercoaster. What is *that* funny? Good grief, you sound like a bunch of teenage girls.

Your choice in ""shower music"" also indicates the same. Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Katy Perry. Oh and the crappy auto-tune rap with the synth-pad percussion. How many generic songs can your iPod hold? It is a constant pounding of the same 4/4 for an hour every morning at 6am.

Speaking of early mornings, I heard you having an orgy around 2am in April last year. What in all the fucks is going on? I'm making tea in my kitchen and all of the sudden I hear ""Shit son, get it dawg. Make her suck dat dick."" I sat at my dinner table and sipped my tea. ""Oh yeah, lick dat pussy."" ""Yoooooo get it in dawg!"" I try watching TV in the living room. (**moaning from multiple people**) I go to my closet to change clothes for bed. ""Choke on dis big dick bitch."" I brush my hair and teeth. (**dogs whimpering**) ""I love it in my pussy."" I try to go to bed. ""Aw sheet n****.""

Your behavior irritates me. But why should I care if this is how you normally interact with people? It's perfectly harmless and none of my business, right?  

No. It's not.  

These men that you ""flirt"" with are blinded by you. So much that they will cater to your every whim so they can spend another moment with you and your cute smile.  

When your car broke down, you threw yourself at Craig and let him know about your hopeless situation. He didn't even hesitate to pay the $400 you needed for car repairs. I knew how crazy he was about you. 

Every day on your lunch hour, you sweet-talk Aaron into buying you a fruit smoothie. But you never actually join him. He's so naive, he doesn't care that he's spending $24 a week on something you don't need.  

The other week, you let Chad walk you home. You two happened to stop by a corner store and you let him know how much you love scratch tickets. Scratch tickets? Really? Now that Chad knows this, he buys you a couple of scratch tickets every other day ""just so, you know, you're not bored."" Are you seriously going to let him do this?  

You wore your jeans out one time at work and complained about it to Jacob. The next day, he came with presents. Four pairs of jeans that he assures you are very durable and will not wear out any time soon. That couldn't have been cheap. You smile at him, and hardly speak a word ever again. He tries to text you, but you ignore his messages.  

On those days that you're too broke to have breakfast, you go to Dave. You tell him that you had so many bills this month that you were struggling to pay for food because you don't get paid enough at your shitty job. Princess, you get paid more than enough. You just suck big-time with managing your finances with all the gambling you've been doing, which by the way you should thank Charles for when he took you out to the casino on your birthday.  

I wouldn't care so much if the people you weren't manipulating weren't my friends. No matter how much I tell them that you're not into them, they won't listen. They're not the most well-adjusted guys, so it drives me crazy when they dip into their savings to get you things that you don't need.  

You were my friend too. But then you did this. And you make fun of these guys with me behind their backs. I'm still pissed off about the two dollars you borrowed from me that you said you were going to pay back.

On October 1st, 2012, at about 2:30 in the afternoon, I took an entire bottle of prescription lortab.
As I began to feel its effects, I began to feel my body numb, and I began using a razor to cut my left arm until it bled.
You all are certainly going to ask ""What were you thinking?!"" 
And many would ask if I thought about how others would feel, and the truth is I didn't. You can say I was being very selfish, and truthfully it was.
Well, I was thinking that to be numb in death was better than living through the pain of my life at the time.
I didn't want to feel anything. 
No emotion, pain or thought.
I really thought that's what I wanted.
As you could imagine, I began to lose consciousness and my father and brother drove me to the hospital in a panic.
I stayed overnight in the Emergency Room the first night, and for four nights after that I was kept in the Intensive Care Unit.
This time was filled with a lot of family visits, a lot of questions, and a hell of a worry.
You see, lortab contains a lot of Tylenol, which can greatly damage the liver. This is why I was kept at the hospital for so long, so the doctors could watch my liver to be sure of my survival.
After the hospital, I was taken to a psychiatric hospital to stay there until they thought I was safe to go home.
Those five days in the psychiatry house will stay with me forever.
I met new people, heard their stories, and we all trusted one another with our feelings; It was great.

He was a mechanic all of his life, eventually running his own Conveyor company.  He was defined by being a big strong guy who put the entire world on his shoulders.  When a family member was sick, he was there.  When one of his workers asked him for a couple hundred dollars advanced to take care of his kid, my dad gave him double and said to forget about it.  It didn't matter who you are, he saw the best in everyone.  Anytime me or my brother got ourselves into trouble he would be there in a heartbeat to bail us out with the only condition of not telling our mother.  The man spent a month in jail in contempt of court over cursing out his judge and threatening his life after he refused to put my brother in his custody (his mom was off the deep end in drug abuse and had repeatedly abused him, but at the time it would have set a precedent to give a father custody in that area).

I've been lucky enough to spend the last few months home with him, enjoying his good days, and scared shitless on the bad.  I've cooked for him, taken him to every doctors appointment, rushed him to the hospital countless times, and then taken him into work (against my will) right as he's released.  

Finally his years of only thinking about others instead of himself caught up to him.  After countless transfusions, drainings, and every possible operation, his liver lost enough function for his kidneys to shutdown, and with that the remainder of his organs.  He wasn't just my hero, he was everything to a lot more people he could have ever imagined.  I miss you dad.

I've tried it, thought it was fun - have used it on random social occasions. I'm for the use of medical marijuana and legalisation.

What I *hate* are the ignorant arguments surrounding this idea that nothing bad can come out of smoking weed, that you can't become ""addicted"" to it. Are you serious?!

Of course when comparing weed to harder substances, alcohol or cigarettes it may seem as though weed is a non-addictive substance... and hell, I don't know the science and how addictive it is chemically... but it can *definitely* be addictive.

People can become addicted to the habit, the socialization, the sensations from smoking. It can definitely become a problem when you rather smoke weed ~~all day, every day~~ and avoid other facets of your life. It has the ability to make smokers become jaded, lazy.

Also, there are obvious health risks but who wants to hear that?

With my ex, I wasn't happy that he smoked every second day. He ended up making excuses instead of seeing me, or leaving early - so he could smoke. I'm pretty sure if you feel the need to lie to your partner, no matter the habit/activity - it is clearly an issue.

Surely I can't be the only one who feels this way?


**Edit: thanks for all the input guys! :) I'm glad we're having a healthy discussion about this, and it's interesting to read people's own experiences with smoking weed and how differently it effects everyone.**

**I think majority of us would agree that *anything* can become addictive, and at the end of the day - it depends on the person.**

You're a long-time singleton in a full-time job and little spare time to meet other people. So you decide to get yourself on a dating website for the chance to speak to new people.

You go through the whole rigmarole, taking time to get pictures of yourself you feel are the most flattering, filling out each of the sections with as much detail and as honestly as possible. With it all done, you start looking for people to contact.

Now since you're just starting out you don't go ahead and contact everyone. So naturally you're more picky. You carefully scour the whole site using various search terms to find someone you feel you would like to meet.

Eventually you do, and on reading their profile everything looks great. You both have the same outlook on life, the same interests (which for you is a rarity given your hobbies), and to boot they're attractive. Great. So spend some time reading their profile, making some notes as you go, then crafting a message to them. Not too wordy, chat about what you both like, what you like, some interesting facts about yourself etc. After making sure you've hit all the salient points (never once going to the route of ""ure so sexy"", you don't want to be a creep online), you send off the message and wait for a reply.

A day goes by. Two. Three. You check the search results again. She's been online since you sent the message. Maybe she hasn't gotten around to reading it? You leave it, since you don't want to swamp her with messages. Give it a week, see how it goes.

A week has gone by. Still nothing. Maybe the message didn't send? So you write up a new one. You politely explain that you're sorry if you've sent her the same message again, but you weren't sure if the last message got through. You go to send it and...

...she's blocked you.

Now this is weird. Why would she block you for one message? It's not like you said anything creepy or untoward. You were just saying a quick hello and seeing if you wanted to talk. Could be any number of reasons though. It's a shame, she seemed really nice.

So you try this a few more times with a few more people on the site you think you'll be compatible with. Again no replies come. You don't force the issue, and you rationalise reasons why they don't reply. They must be busy. Guys must be flooding their inbox. They might be dating someone already.

But deep down it gnaws at you, even if you don't realise. After some time without getting a single reply, you begin to wonder if you're being too picky. After all, men often get berated for being too shallow when it comes to women. Maybe you should keep an open mind.

So you start messaging more people. Many of them you don't see anything like a deep connection. Their profile is threadbare and only really says they like to go out. Well who doesn't? You still have some criteria; live in local area, are reasonably attractive to you etc.

Still nothing. Not a single reply. And each time you've read their profiles, understood where you may have similarities, talked about them more. What are you doing wrong? They can't all decide not to reply, can they?

So you get paranoid. You start combing through your profile, seeing if something is turning people away. Height 5'9""? Well on a good day it can get to 5'10"", I'll say 5'10"". You included computer games as a hobby. What are you, mental? Take that out. Leave the bit about going to the gym though, infact why not put in cycling in there? That picture you've got on, you're not smiling enough. Take that away too. Longest relationship maybe? Put that as three years. It's a lie, but maybe they're just not trustworthy of guys who haven't been in long-term relationships.

Even with these changes, and with the ever decreasing criteria you use to search, no one is replying to you. Just logging onto the site is beginning to make you feel miserable. You can feel a lump in your chest when you even think about it; why won't they just reply? What's wrong with me? What am I doing wrong?

Desperation sets in. Every day you send a message to every new member. You must seem like some kind of crazy person to them, surely. What if some of them know each other you think. ""Did that guy message you as soon as you joined to?"", ""Yeah he did, what a loser"". You shake your head. You're being paranoid again. There's nothing wrong with you, is there?

One day there comes a turning point. You're going through the search again. You're staring at a sea of faces of people who, in your mind, have rejected you before. None of them have really, they just never replied to you. You try to tell yourself there's a difference, but to your mind being ignored by hundreds of women is akin to rejection. And on a grand scale.

That's when you take off all the filters. Even some of the deal breakers such as whether or not they take drugs. You hit the search button. Some new faces appear, faces that the more you look at them the less inclined you are to message.

You see one profile, you stare at the main picture. The person is...well, they're at the least not attractive to you. To someone maybe, but to you? You got into their profile. There's nothing you have in common. But you're desperate for something anything. ""She'll do"" you resign to yourself, and you send out the briefest of messages. Maybe you try to self-sabotage a bit by not putting as much effort in as possible. In the back of your mind, you don't want this one to be replied to. You think you don't really want to speak to them, you're just trying to prove a point.

Except they do message back. They're one of the first ever to do it.

That's when it hits you like a truck. The only reason you messaged this person is because no one else would speak to you. You didn't even want to have anything to do with this person in a date capacity at all. You just decided to settle. You read through their reply. You might be making it up, but the sense of disappointment seems tangible. Shit, they actually mention they don't get messages often.

Immediately you feel like a complete sack of shit, as you realise this person is you. They too have probably been rebuked several times on the site, like you they were probably just being as polite as possible, but no one would reply to them. And now as you sit here, failing to gain any sort of attachment whatsoever, despair sets in in it's totality. You realise just how indifferent you feel to this woman. You feel like the world's biggest asshole for even messaging her in the first place. You daren't even reply back, you feel that horrible about yourself.

So you delete your profile. This is just getting too much. You've hit rock bottom, done something awful and acted like a prick into the bargain. You feel worthless and pathetic. Perhaps worst is you feel you are undeserving of love and companionship. When everyone else won't even speak to you and someone who you don't find attractive will, you wonder if there's any point to it all. You wallow, you bemoan, you lose sleep over it.

Yet you have to carry on. Why? Because everyone around you says it'll get better. That you've just got to ""get yourself out there"" and the right person will come along. Well to them I say this;

I've been through the above scenario on several dating websites for the past six years. In that time I've been on a total of three dates. One was with someone who immediately said they didn't want to see me again after the first date, another was with someone who stopped even speaking to me after a few dates, and the last was so neurotic it was clear I was there as a comfort blanket and nothing more. Between my job and personal commitments I have no opportunities to meet new women. And all the talk of just waiting becomes more and more hollow as I go through this process time and time again.

I know it's a strangers word to take on face value, and that many would judge me and assume I must be some awful individual, one of those fake ""nice guys"". All I can say is that I can't prove what sort of person I am except through those who know me. Of my friends that I have many of them say how they like spending time with me, and how I always go out of my way to help out others and make others happy.

I had broken up with her a bit before because it was long distance, and certain circumstances would prevent us from ever meeting. We had met on Omegle, and she said she fell in love with me the second she saw me. I honestly couldn't say the same about her, but I still texted her because what the hell. I then found out too late about her troubled past: her father had molested her and her siblings, and she claimed he was the man who kept the little kid in that bunker in Alabama. She was also transgender, and the surgeon who performed the SRS on her was unlicensed, causing her extreme pain daily. She threatened suicide, and I managed to talk her out of it.

Fast forward to Valentine's Day. I hate Valentine's Day, and in a spot of depression and anguish because of my transgenderness and more, I broke up with her. Still mad, I ignored her follow-up text. It was only my name. Now, 90 minutes ago, I received the following text.

This goes out to all *****'s family, and friends that were not able to make it to the hospital on her last hours. At 7:52am Heaven gained another angel. Rest in peace my sweet sweet sister &lt;3

Sister: 18, 11 at time of events

Cousin, K: 20, 13 at time of events


When I was a child, my immediate family was very close with my extended paternal family. We spent holidays there (they were only twenty minutes away and had a large amount of land with a huge deck and a pool) and my sister, our cousins, and I would stay for days at a time every couple of weeks during the summer. 
My grandmother's husband was technically our step-grandfather, but he had married my grandmother when my father was a toddler, so he was just as much our grandparent as she was. He would playfully spank us and play with us in the pool, but we never had even a slight reason to distrust him.

In the summer of 2006, my sister and I went to spend the night with our grandparents. For some reason, our cousins were not there with us that day, which was very unusual. I slept in the large bed in the back bedroom instead of sleeping in the same room as my sister (a room that had two twin beds). I will always regret it.

That night, my grandfather molested my little sister. She told my parents almost as soon as we got home, and they called my grandmother in rage. She left for her sister's house (which was right next door) and my parents called the police. My grandfather shot himself before the police could get there.

After these events, we tried to stay close to my grandmother. We didn't blame her, of course. However, she made it impossible. She claimed that it wasn't her husband that committed the events; apparently, he was on some mix of medications that made him snap. She said he was still in Heaven and that I would go to Hell if I did not forgive him. She called me a hateful person because I was so angry.

My cousin, K, and I are only 3 months apart, so we were very close as children. She was close to my sister as well, and I never imagined that she would not be supportive. I wish I had been right. A couple of years ago, when she turned 18, K got an ""RIP"" tattoo in memory of my grandfather. She posted this on facebook, even though she was friends with my sister. She claimed that she would not blame him for one little mistake and that we needed to just get over it. She (and other family members) frequently post statuses about how they wish my grandfather was still here. It is not just one or two of my family members that feel this way; it is my entire paternal family. They blame my parents for breaking our family apart.

Maybe I am over-reacting, but I am flabbergasted that anyone could behave this way.

She's always been a social butterfly and knows nearly everyone on campus. She's funny, beautiful and also completely affectionate and invested in our relationship. I know she loves me (and I her). A real catch judging by all outward appearances!

And there's the problem. I can't vent to anyone we know because of how genuinely revolting some of her behavior is behind closed doors. I couldn't embarrass her like that, and for that matter I'm unsure of whether or not they'd believe me. 

The dirt: My girlfriend is one of the laziest people I've ever met. I can't remember the last time she's cleaned her room without me leading the charge and **demanding** that we clean it up, because I can't stay in there any more. I've cleaned her room for her countless times as well, but it gets so bad so quickly that I've given up on doing it for her. She's on par with hoarders if she isn't considered one herself. I can never find my clothes or my things because her room devours them. Rotting food, clothes in a layer a foot deep spread across her room... I slept in my car last night because the smell in here made me vomit (absolutely no hyperbole here.)

My girlfriend refuses to bathe with any regularity or normal frequency, to the point where our sex life has dropped off completely. I'd understand if thi were tied into some sort of depression, but I can say with total confidence that she just doesn't like going through the process of it. She's too lazy to shower. 

My girlfriend regularly splays out her legs and will try to gross me out by spreading her vagina out when there's some sort of weird discharge going on, then she complains that I'm never in the mood.

She farts CONSTANTLY and refuses to give me the courtesy of holding it in until I leave the room or of walking away from me to take care of it. This isn't us sitting on the couch with her letting one go occasionally, this is farting on me while we're spooning or on my lap, multiple times a day. She knows it bothers me (it was kind of cute the first few times, but it's been way too long) and doesn't care. She's too lazy to get up.

She blows her nose in everything nearby, including my clean work clothes. It's so foul.

She tells me about her poop, her gas, her period blood... the other week she was trying to force out a fart in bed and ended up squirting her blood out and onto the sheets. She still hasn't washed them.

I want to break up with her so badly because of this but I still love her.

I don't expect anyone to read this, I don't expect to get upvoted for this. I just think this will be very therapeutic to type out. I'm fully aware that there are loads of people with much bigger problems and I really need to put my life in perspective.

***

**TL;DR:** My sisters have financially fucked up the family and are consistently ungrateful for the many thousands of pounds my parents have wasted on them. I feel like I'm suffering the most because my sisters deserve their shitty situations whereas I have done nothing but excel academically and demand little financially (I'm aware of how arrogant that sounds)

***

My two big sisters have fucked everything up for my family for separate reasons. I think they share the generic temperament of one of my parents, whereas I share the temperament of the other.

But yeah, they've fucked up their lives and thrown many others off track because of their actions. My parents have very little money now, and they've said they're financially dedicated to making sure I get the opportunities I deserve, where my sisters have handed themselves shit.

***

**Sister one:**

Sister one is now 23, and gradually recovering from her collective fuckups, even though she is completely fucking stupid.

Through her teenage years, she took drugs, drank and had sex underage. When she was about 15 she was going out with a 21 year old. This isn't the main fuckup, this is an example of her fuckuppery.

The main fuckup was when she was about 18 she started to go out with this wanker who was about 35. This guy was living off benefits and had beat previous girlfriends in the past. He had a scam going on. He would go out with a girl for a few years while using her bank details to purchase expensive things for himself. He'd then dump them when he was done.

As if this wasn't bad enough, he also caused as much havoc to their family as possible. For example, we had a family computer. Before I knew as much as I do now about computers, we were having trouble with it. My sister and her scumbag boyfriend were staying over for a weekend. He lied about having computer knowledge, saying he could fix it. Instead of fixing it, he **intentionally** deleted **all** personal documents of **every** family member. This included Sister B's **coursework**, my parents' important **work documents** as well as some only copies of photographs from family events etc.

Anyway, this guy was abusive and he even insulted me personally (a child at this stage) when he was **staying in my parents' house**. He would constantly start arguments and threaten the family. My sister was pretty much brainwashed, and she pleaded with my parents not to call the police.

Eventually, my sister ran up debts amounting to over Â£50,000. She has yet to pay them off fully. She has attempted university courses funded by my parents to get a proper job but she constantly gives up on everything she tries.

This is the main fuckup. She is a massive and constant financial drain to my parents who have given her so much in return for literally nothing. Just this month they bought her a fucking car. Why? She injured her ankle when drunk and now requires a manual car to not be in minor pain from using the clutch on her usual stick car.

Another recent fuckup: the shower in her flat broke so she went to her boyfriend's (who is OK) mother's house to shower. Because of this, she had no time to do paperwork that was due to be completed for that evening. She knew she had to do this, she just didn't think ahead.

Fuck you, sister A. You stupid fucking bitch.

***

**Sister B:**

Sister B did the same drugs and alcohol and stuff as sister A. She was taken home by the police at 13 years of age for standing on a street corner smoking at 2am. No prizes for guessing what she was probably doing.

Only difference is, she got pregnant at 14. Intentionally. No split condom, no accidentally not pulling out in time, she went out of her way to have sex with someone because she thought it would be cute to have a child.

And now, at 18, she does fuck all for her. She is a terrible parent. She still lives at home and basically, my parents, the grandparents, are doing her parenting duties. They have some kind of legal thing that means they are sort of half guardians but they don't have complete guardianship of their granddaughter, my niece.

She's dating some guy right now who is an alright guy but he's perfectly satisfied laying down that floor material playgrounds are made out of for the foreseeable rest of his life. He's a stereotypical chav, if you're from the UK and know what they are. A few months ago he was arrested for beating up a guy with his friends simply because he was Polish (the other guy). He lives with his parents at 19, didn't go to college and spends what little money he has on designer clothes that he does not need. If you know what GCSE's are then you'll understand the relevance of the fact that he left secondary school with **three GCSEs**

Strangely, he spends about 3 nights a week sleeping at my parents' house with my parents, sister B and I. Which is pretty weird in my opinion. My sister is trying to do all she can to get him to move in full time. I don't know why he puts up with my sister, she's a total bitch to my family and him. When he stays here he's a total pig. He doesn't flush the toilet or wash up and when he shaves he leaves the sink covered in his shaved off hair.

Anyway, sister B takes everything for granted. My overly generous parents have handed everything to her on a platter yet they still have a screaming match every week which always ends with her in hysteria, exclaiming how horrible parents they are. Seriously. The other week she was screaming ""you're a fucking terrible mother, you don't do shit for me!"". She said that... **In front of her three year old daughter**. While crying and blithering.

I'm pretty sure she has a mental disorder. I'm not saying that to insult her, I think she's genuinely mentally unwell. She gets hysterical over nothing. One day, perfectly happy and kind. Next, she'll swear at you for reaching across her to get some BBQ sauce (which actually happened to my mother a few days ago. This was just after my sister asked my mother to cut my niece's pasta for her, since she doesn't like doing it. Crazy bint.)

For some reason she applied to join the police force. She failed the basic psych tests. God knows what they'd do if they looked into her background.

The only reason she hasn't been kicked out of the house is because she'll take her daughter (who she named with a stupid ditsy name, because it was cute), and she's a terrible parent.


***

And then there's me, the youngest sibling. At 16 I'm in the process of finishing my GCSEs. So far, they've been a breeze. In my free time I use online guides to teach myself how to code on a computer I built myself and I like to read books about psychology. In comparison, my sisters would spend that same free time getting high.

For my A levels I'm doing Psychology, Business, Law and Maths. I plan to be a primarily prosecuting barrister of criminal law.

I'm glad my dad and I get along well. He's the only breath of sanity I get in this fucked up family. My mum's pretty messed up too, but I won't go into it. I'm pretty sure it's where my sisters got it from.

The main thing that keeps me optimistic is the thought that in a couple of decades, the contrast between my situation and my sisters' will be nothing but humorous.

***

So basically, I'm the child that *must* go well, as vocalised by both of my parents on separate occasions. I get the feeling that I'm responsible for giving my parents a decent legacy. They clearly resent my sisters but they won't just write them off, despite the fact that I would have long ago. They're just great people, despite my mother's flaws.

***

*footnote:* I was right, typing that out was very therapeutic. If you actually read all of this, thank you, you must be very bored. If you think I'm being a whiny little cunt, I'm sorry and I understand why you think that.

Nine months ago, I saw you for the second time in four years.  I was horrified by what I saw, by what you told me.  You hadn't eaten much for days.  You were deaf in one ear because your mother wouldn't take you to a doctor for your infection.  You'd traveled alone with strange adults because none of the four adults on the bus you lived on thought to check for you before they left.  Your mother was on drugs you couldn't pronounce.  You couldn't read.  You needed glasses.  You were smoking pot.  You'd tried to convince girls to get high and have sex with you.

You were nine years old.

My heart broke.  It shattered into a billion tiny pieces, every one a piercing pain.  I'd trusted her to always do what was best for her kids.  I thought you were safe with her.  I thought you were all as happy as she pretended on Facebook.  I was a fucking idiot.  I should have known she lied.  She always lies.  Nothing is ever ""wrong"", it's just ""time to move on"".  It's not begging for money, it's ""waiting for the universe to provide"".  It's not dumpster diving, its ""a free cold meal"".  It's not living in a bus, it's ""a cross-country camping adventure"".  She dragged you through her trail of chaos and never a hint of how bad things had gotten.

I filed for custody.  She ran with you.  Did she ever tell you?  What did she tell you the reason was for leaving town that weekend?  I promised you I'd see you again in a couple days, she agreed in front of you.  Did she tell you I filed custody?  Did she tell you she deleted her Facebook to keep me from finding you?  Did she tell you I went to court four times to try to convince them you were in immediate danger?  That you weren't eating?  That you couldn't read?  That you weren't getting medical attention?  That you were smoking pot?  Did she tell you she didn't show up for court to defend her parenting?  Did she tell you she left the papers she'd been served on the floor of the coffee shop that morning?  Did she tell you she was on the run?  Did she tell you anything?

I won the case because she didn't show up.  I got everything I asked for because she didn't show up.  I now have full custody with no unapproved contact, period.  She has no idea, because she ran.  Oh, she's calling it ""growing wings and flying away"" now?  Usual ""pretend everything's fine"" spin.  If she pretends it was her choice, she doesn't have to admit that it's actually reality catching up with her.

Soon you'll be here with me.  You won't see her for a very long time.  Will you be upset?  Relieved?  Worried about your little brother and sister?  Happy to not be living on a bus with several adults, several kids, and several dogs?  Will you believe me when I tell you I've been fighting for you for nine months while she ran?  That I tried for nearly six of those months just to track her down to serve the papers?  Will it click that every time you 'spontaneously' left a place you'd been for weeks, it was because she'd heard I found you and was arranging for a person to serve the papers?  Will you believe me when I say I've never stopped worrying about you, never stopped thinking about you, never stopped wishing I could have you back in my life?  Will you believe me when I tell you how much I love you?  Will you believe me when I tell you I've been working for years to get my life in order enough to bring you here?  Will you believe me when I tell you that you're the only reason we were looking at a larger apartment?  That third bedroom I talked about, the one whose mention made you so sad nine months ago...  That bedroom was for you, so you would have privacy and space, so you would have a larger bedroom than your whole shared living space has been for 2 years.

You're ten years old now.  I still have your Christmas and birthday presents safe.  They're still wrapped, waiting for you.  There's a new computer for you.  There's all your favorite games in my Steam inventory, ready to gift to you when you set up your own account.  There's money for clothes that fit.  There's insurance - medical, dental, vision - ready to get your body fixed up.  There's homeschool curriculum to get you ready for the real world.  There's a line on our cell plan and a phone for you - it's not really fancy, but it's Android and it's yours.  I can't wait to see your face when you find out.

I don't know who you are anymore.  You changed from a little kid into a big kid, and she kept me out of your life while it happened.  I don't know what you like, what you enjoy doing, what you want out of life, I don't know any of it.  Well, you like video games - what ten year old boy doesn't, right?  I want to know you.  I want to know what kind of incredible person is underneath all that shit she piled on you.  Are you an actor?  An artist?  A musician?  A programmer?    I want to see you grow, learn, change, and become an adult.  I want you to become a person YOU can be proud of.

Do you want to know me?  My wife?  Your little brother you've only met once?  You've always been my little man.  Am I still your dad?


EDIT:  This started as a simple vent, and has since snowballed into something much more.  Since I wrote this a week ago, I now have my son here.

During the confrontation, my ex screamed many accusations that simply aren't true.

You were obviously drunk.  My wife and I rounded the corner a block away from the house you were standing in front of and we could tell even from that distance that you were intoxicated.  You were standing with several other college-age males in front of a rundown house broadcasting loud music.  We could see numerous other people on the front porch and it looked like lots of people were inside.  Looked like folks were having a great time.

We crossed to the other side of the street specifically to avoid you.  As we got closer we saw and heard you harass two young girls as they tried to walk past you on the sidewalk.  As we passed you (on the other side of the street) you turned and looked at us, and yelled âWeâre going hard!!!â at the top of your lungs while holding your crotch with both hands and gyrating your hips toward us.  You repeated the phrase several times and when we didnât respond (and kept walking) you said something to the effect of âyouâre probably a fag anywayâ and âhey babe come over here if you want a real manâ.  A couple of your friends were standing by and seemed to be laughing and supporting your behavior.

Let me let you in on a few things.  First of all, Iâm a college professor in my early 40s.  My wife is also a college professor, though sheâs a bit younger than me in her late 30âs.  In fact, I would bet good money that we are profs at the college you go to (I might be wrong but Iâm assuming youâre a college kid as you and your friends looked the part your house is only 4 blocks from campus in an area dominated by students, and classes start this week so lots of parties are going on).  I hope for your sake that you are not in our classes.  We remember quite well what you look like.

Second, my wife lost a close family member several days ago.  She has been trying to work through the grieving process, and we were out walking that night trying to talk through some of that grief.  She had been crying off and on for days.  The last thing she needed was a drunk kid yelling at her.

Third, in addition to being in mourning, my wife is about as sweet and innocent as girls come.  I know that sounds corny, but I canât think of a better way to describe her.  Sheâs very shy and soft-spoken and kind.  She weighs in at 100 pounds sopping wet.  She doesnât drink or party or curse, and she was not only offended by your behavior, she was legitimately scared.  You are a pretty big guy and you really rattled her already grieving mind.  She kept looking over her shoulder and was afraid maybe you were following us or something.  When we went for a walk the next night she specifically requested that we not go anywhere near the house you were at.  Sheâs now afraid to go down that street.

Lastly, despite the fact that my wife is sweet and innocent, I assure you that I am not.  In fact, it took everything I had to hold myself back from walking across that street and beating your sorry ass into the pavement.  If the stars were not aligned for you that night, I would have done exactly that.  If my wife had not already spent the previous three days crying over her lost loved one, I would have shown you just what can happen when you behave obnoxiously to the wrong guy (and his girl).

It was a combination of anorexia and bulimia, sometimes referred to as being ""Bulimirexic"". Basically I restricted my food intake as much as I could without being suspicious and what I did eat I would purge within 10 minutes of consumption. 

I was obsessed with being a size zero and being small. Going clothes shopping was  a big deal. If I ever felt like the jeans I tried on were too small it lead to another cycle of violent purging, refusing to eat and extreme exercising.

Yesterday I walked into American Eagle with the hope of finding some new jeans. The stylist brought me a size two. I wasn't offended or hurt by her assumption of my size. I tried them on and they fit perfectly. I looked in the mirror and I didn't feel fat, I felt proud and I felt good about my body.

After a five year battle with my ED yesterday was a mile stone. Its been three months since the last time I purged and I've been eating almost 2500 calories a day in attempts to gain weight. I weight lift five to six days a week, my body looks and feels better than ever. 

Yesterday I bought size two jeans and it feels amazing.

EDIT:I didn't have anyone to talk to who would really understand why buying size two jeans was such a big deal to me. So thank you reddit for reading and for all the kind words/advice. You guys are great :)

I ~~have~~ had a beard. A nice beard.  A beard I hadn't shaven since I started college. I'm out of college. I had trimmed, sure.  Sometimes, I had trimmed it an inch from my face.

But my face was always covered. 

I loved my beard.  It was a victory beard.  My mom and my ex-girfriend wouldn't let me grow one, so once I was free from both, I vowed to never shave.

As a late bloomer, it was also nice to look older. 

A few weeks ago I interviewed for a ""big boy"" job.  For this job I can't have anything more than a goatee.  After much deliberation I accepted the position, and resigned myself to cutting my glorious facial hair down to a goatee.

I hadn't done this in years.  Most recently I had shaped a chin strap, but for the last few months I was just letting it get mountain-manny.

I went too far.  I trimmed the goatee unevenly.  I kept trying to even it out until all of a sudden my chin was bare.

All I have now is a moustache that looks terrible. I know I'll have to shave it before I start work.  I know that.

But for now I'm holding.  I'm taking one more night with you, facial hair.

The only way to get there was when you had zero lives. This is an important detail.

So, I'm playing the game, when my Dad comes in and tells me it's time to go to bed. In my utter childhood naivetÃ©, I said, ""Okay, just let me kill myself."" Meaning, you know, let me get to the Save Game screen.

The color drained from my father's face. ""Buddy,"" he said, ""Please don't *EVER* hurt yourself! It's just a game. You can keep playing, but PLEASE DON'T EVER SAY THAT!!!""

I had *zero* clue what had upset my Dad, and I remember giving him this WTF face while he got all teary-eyed and flustered. I didn't know what was going on. A second later it clicked and I quickly said, ""In the game, Dad. I need to kill my player to get to the Save Game screen."" But, it was too late. The *damage was done*.

The next week, I had an appointment with a childhood psychiatrist for ""what I had said.""

I was endlessly confused by the whole experience, but my parents had primed the doctor that I was saying I was going to hurt myself and that I was trying to ""hide"" it now. To make matters worse, I had become ""aggressive when confronted about it,"" which *clearly* meant I was *super duper* hiding something. Perish the thought that maybe I was frustrated with the endless gaslighting and the stubborn insistence that ""it was okay"" and the constant pleas to just ""admit what you said,"" etc.

I went to that doctor every week for something like three months before I finally cracked and was like, ""Why yes, I am stressed. Thank you for inducing it in me with three months of this bullshit."" They rejoiced that I was *finally* opening up, and they wanted to go deeper into my pain, my stress, etc. 

It was surreal. Finally, after a few more months of stalled ""progress"" the doctor threw in the towel and said I needed more after-school activities. I didn't want to do any, but they forced me to do them, which stressed me out, which freaked them out more, etc.

To this day, my parents are convinced I'm hiding suicidal ideations.

I first had the class on Tuesday, a guy (we will call him **Frank**) sat next to me and we talked for a while, he was pretty cool. We talked about computers and stuff.

Thursday comes and Frank sits next to me again and he's acting a bit unusual. Then it hit me and I just blurted out to him 

""Are you..are you hitting on me?""

He became very red and sheepishly said ""Yeah""

Not going to lie it felt kidna nice, I just went through a hard breakup and it felt good but anyway I wanted to laugh. Not because he's gay but just because it seemed silly to me. I didn't laugh because I wasn't sure how he'd take it. So I very kindly said ""Sorry dude but I don't swing that way""


I could tell he was disappointing but then he smiled and looked at me and said ""Alright but I'm not going to give up on you"" He sorta laughed and I did too. It didn't bother me, hell I liked the fact that anyone seemed interested in me.


So Friday came along, just like Thursday he sat next to me and we talked and he then asked if he could touch my hair. I get asked this a lot from people because I have soft and pretty long hair, it's about 20 in long. 


I laughed and said sure and he touched it and then this guy behind me(we will call him **billy**) said ""Hey don't you touch him you faggot"" I quickly turned and looked at him to see if he was just joking but based on his southern accent, confederate flag shirt, and ""I'm a proud redneck"" hat, I assumed he wasn't.


Me-""excuse me?""

 
Redneck-""Why would you let a faggot like him touch you like that, people like him need to burn in hell""


I stood up, and got in his face and said loud enough for everyone to hear (I'm pretty sure I yelled) ""You better shut your damn mouth or I'll shut it for you""


At that point the gay kid ran out and the professor came between me and the redneck and I explained what happened. The professor just told everyone to go home and he told me to go cool down, everyone left except for the professor and the redneck.


When I got outside the room Frank came up to me and gave me a giant hug, he was crying. Everyone just watched as I received an abnormally long hug. Finally after he calmed down a bit he explained to me that he had be mocked his whole life for being gay and nobody had ever stood up for him before.


He is now my first friend that I've made in college.


I'll leave it at this, no matter your age or sex if you see somebody being mocked or insulted for being gay,trans or anything. Stand up for them.


Also if it physically bothers you that someone is gay or different. Don't say anything, politely move yourself away from them, do not confront them. You never know when there will be a guy like me around who will knock you on your ass for it.

**Edit 1**: Wow I didn't think this many people would see this. Some of you wanted to see my hair so after I get back from donating some of it I'll take a pic. Have a nice day.

I had accidentally left my wallet at my friend's apartment off campus, so I had no money for food until my shift ended (at around 2am -- and it was 8pm on a Sunday, everything was closed). 

I hadn't eaten all day, so I was kinda desperate. But I didn't have anyone to bring me my wallet. 

At a loss, I sent a text to my then-crush, R. He was the type of guy that I thought was disgustingly attractive. Like, every time I looked at him I would just squawk a reply and blush. I used every opportunity to text him (we met through mutual friends). 

I told him, ""I may actually die of starvation."" Just as a joke, I wasn't expecting anything from it. Hell, I didn't expect him to give me the time of day. After I told him what my predicament was, he showed up with a feast from Taco Bell a few minutes later. 

We ended up sitting in my office and having a ""Taco Bell date,"" as he calls it. Found out he was single and totally available, and I took a plunge and just asked him out -- and he said yes!

Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be a long one.

Some background story. I know of a girl (let's call her Mary). A few years ago, Mary and I was hooking up and she confided in me that she got raped. She explained what happened as she remembered it. It was a formal for one of the fraternities at my University. She went with one of the brothers and verbally stated that she did not intend on sleeping with him, prior to arriving at the event. There was a lot of alcohol involved and at the end of the night (or more accurately the next morning) Mary woke up in the guy's bedroom without her panties. She woke up the guy, asked if they had sex to which he replied yes. Mary left and started calling her friends that were with her at the event asking how she was during said event as it was very hazy from her memory. The responses Mary gathered were that she was not looking very good due to the booze and had to be taken back sooner than anticipated. This is how Mary and the guy ended back at his place where they had non-consensual sex. Mary went to the president of the fraternity and told him of the details and they filed a police report. The guy was apprehended and tried, was found innocent, but moved schools.

Fast forward to more recent times. During the Obama-Romney election, I had Mary as well as a few of my friends over at my house. We were discussing politics, and all the girls indirectly voiced strong opinion that they were single issue voters voting for Obama because as Mary put it, ""my vagina has rights"" in regards to the pro-life / pro-choice issue. My friend, (let's call him Lawrence) objected stating that women has much more reproductive rights than men do in the US. As a outspoken feminist, Mary was visibly infuriated with this comment, and asked to speak to me in private. When we arrived at the kitchen, she asked how I could be friends with Lawrence, when I was so clearly a feminist as well (which was true at the time). 

I then told Mary the tale of how we first got together. I was living in the same dorm as Mary at the time. Lawrence and I were drinking playing Guitar Hero. I got heavily intoxicated to the point I could no longer play the game, and Lawrence decided to text girls in my phone for shits and giggles (with my permission of course). Lawrence started sending flirtatious texts to Mary to which she responded very positively to. I reminded Lawrence that I knew she had a thing for me, and the reason I had not gotten together with her yet was because I was still on the fence about it i.e. I did not make the decision on whether or not I wanted to sleep with her. After sending a few more texts, Lawrence informed me to go upstairs where Mary was and to have sex with her. Next thing I know I'm pushed out of my room, and I slowly make it up to Mary's room, obviously heavily intoxicated. **I don't recall anything more of that night.** When I awoke, I was in my boxers, in bed with Mary, with a used condom on the floor. I woke her up, asked if we had sex, and she said yes. Sound familiar? Because I had no memory of this, I asked to have sex with her again that morning, and we did. (This is important).

Even if I were to say that I wanted to have sex with Mary, I was very much raped by Mary on all legal counts. I was very clearly and obviously intoxicated, and unable to give consent to sexual intercourse, while she was completely sober. As I told her this, Mary stated that she was sorry I felt this way, and that I could file a police report if I deemed necessary. She defended her actions by saying that I wanted it, that when I woke up in the morning sober, I asked to have sex with her again.

Well that's weird. Of all the people that would understand the underlying reason why I would say that under those circumstances, it was her. And she didn't get it. My brain couldn't compute the idea that I was raped. In order to deal with this, it was easier to try and make myself believe I wanted it. Of course I wanted to have sex with her. Why would I have done it otherwise? Since it was something I wanted to do, I better have a memory of it so I could cherish it. That it was a good thing to happen to me. Because I am a man and I clearly couldn't be a victim of rape. And it finally occurred to me. Mary believed these very same thoughts I was trying to convince myself was true. She couldn't be the aggressor. How could she? She's the *woman*. He *wanted* it.

This is why I'm not a feminist anymore. In fact, I can't believe I bought into this before. Feminism today doesn't reflect on how to have gender equality. It bashes men and always find ways to portray women as the victim. Despite being told over and over again ""YOU RAPED ME"" by me, Mary carries on nonchalantly. All the while feeling strong injustice of her own rape incident, not at all feeling remorse for her own actions as a rapist.

It's BULLSHIT.

It is 12:16 am. I just managed to get my daughter to sleep after what felt like a two-hour roller coaster. Everything started off fine. She put on her pajamas by herself for the first time. She did her homework quicker than normal tonight, even did some extra work writing numbers and the ABC on the adjacent page of her notebook, only because âI can do it mommy!â

I was very proud of her, but regardless, even with all the wonderful acts of independence and self-reliance, tonight was the night I lost my cool. After the first 30 minutes, where she refused to stop moving around, she reverted to playing with a toy. Tonight she picked a small plastic toy, the McDonaldâs kind, and for the next twenty or so minutes she triggered the toys âopenâ button, and then closed it; on and off, on and off, on and off. I initially thought that if I where to lie down on my bed (perpendicular to hers) and stretched out my arm to rub her back she would calm down long enough to sleep. She revised my plans by grabbing my hand with her left, holding it tightly, and continued her playing with the right. This went on for really about 20 minutes or soâ¦ or, well, thatâs how it felt, because in reality I fell asleep. I woke up much later. I was astonished at her persistence and her restlessness. Her legs would sporadically move, left to right, folded, stretched, crossed, and her eyes where glazed over as she stared at the ceiling. I thought she had fallen asleep like so, her arm merely mimicking her actions while awake, a-la phantom-limb style.  

Okâ¦ so we where still at this. I looked at the clock. 11:35. I have court tomorrow at 9:30 am, nearly 30 minutes away from home. Her class starts at 8:30.  She normally takes about an hour and a half or more to eat, with all her distractions that is, and I would need at least an hour to change her and get her ready for school aside from that. All in all, I calculate she should be waking up at 7am the latest, after all her daycare is almost 5 minutes away.  Knowing this I made the mistake of once again staying late at work so she could socialize with my co-workers. SCOFF you say!? Well, believe it or not she gets a kick out of it. She loves âmommyâs friends at workâ they dote on her so, she is a princess there, and boy does it make it convenient for me. Why, I am so deprived from any social life I always jump at the offer. I knew, however, the mistake I was making. I was already leaving later than usual. I clocked out almost at 8:15, didnât take her homework with me after I got back to my job from picking her up (sheâd normally do it at my job) and then tried to âeconomizeâ by not eating dinner at my job so we wouldnât âwaste food at homeâ. We came in at almost 9pm. Dinnertime. After about 35 minutes where she refused to eat anything other than her fruit purees (at 4 years old) she got started on her homework. I was so happy when she finished and the clock was still 20 seconds away from switching to 10:15. Yet here we where again, late as always and struggling to do something as simple as sleeping.

I looked back at her, still amazed. How could she possibly have so much energy? She jumped around and played so much at my job, and I knew it rained today but they did get lots of indoor play time at daycare, not only that but sheâd been up since 6 am! She woke up yesterday all on her own to go pee at 6am and stayed up with me.  I was infuriated, but I knew I couldnât show it. Her therapist told me to stick to positive reinforcement and screaming at her just wonât do. I have never been much of a screaming parent either, but my anger was rising and I knew I would be turning into my mother any second now. I told her to stop, âplease put the toy downâ, âitâs not playtimeâ, and âsleep time is just for sleepingâ. Boy did she pick the wrong reaction for the wrong time. She sat up, gave me a cold and disapproving glare, and said âNO! Youâre mean!â I struggled to calm myself, but I managed to ask her âplease, put the toy down or you will get a time outâ. Thatâs when she crossed the line and I stumbled from mid sleep into a full train wreck. She defiantly stood up and said âNO! You get a time out! Iâm going to play with my toy.â I tried to recover from what I knew would be an instant bad decision. I reached over slowly to grab the toy, I cannot believe I thought that would work, and of course it didnât, and when she pulled her hand back screaming ""no"" I didnât even realize how quickly I went from Dr. Jekyl to Hyde. In one move I grabbed her toy, threw it as far as I could, and threw my arms around her tightly to stop her from thrashing about. She started to scream, blood-curling screams, I immediately started to fear for my rights as a parent. I placed my hand over her mouth and told her to calm down. She started to relax but it was cut short, her boogers where overwhelming, and she started to cough. I went cold; it felt like a bath of ice water; shame, guilt, and flashbacks, all at once. I relaxed my grip on her, and then for the first time in about a year did something I was sure to never feel again. I started calling myself a horrible mother, trying to soothe this urge to hurt myself physically, trying to punish myself as quickly and effectively as possible. She stopped crying almost immediately and hugged me. She kissed me on the cheek right before telling me I wasnât a bad mommy. Oh how it hurt, how it still hurts to see your child console you like if you where hersâ¦ Itâs not right, and boy how I paid for it. Her sainthood lasted about 5 minutes. I pleaded with her to please go to sleep. How stupid am I for trying to reason with a 4 year old. She started calling me a bad mom, now that she knows even I call myself that, and started telling me she was leaving. She didnât care if threatened her with a time out. When I asked her why she was being so mean she smirked. This was all a game to her. It doesnât matter what punishment I threaten with, what prize I wave in her face, if sheâs not having it, she will fight harder than most adults and teens I know. 

I didnât believe it before, but after typing all of this out her symptoms of ODD are just so blatantly obvious. Itâs so sad to me, so strange, and so entirely belittling, that a traumatic event like her father abusing her has left me so incapable of parenting, so incredible incompetent and pointless. I feel so weak, weaker than Iâve ever felt. My daughter wasnât like this. She went from being a golden child in school to the problem kid; the one the teacher has to sit aside to get her to finish the class work, the one the teachers have to keep eyes in the back of their heads for. This isnât encouraging any more. I thought I could do it, I thought I could be super mom, me and my two semesters of child psychology in college, but Iâm not. Iâm nobody.

  She asked me to pretend to be daddy two days ago. At first I thought she wanted me to play with her dolls (we where driving) but as soon as I said âhey K.T.â with my best impression of a male voice, she asked âDaddy, why is it night time?â I felt so blind sighted. I asked her why did she make me do that. Her answer? âI want a daddyâ.

I canât do this.

I just need to feel like I've expressed this somehow. I can't bring myself to talk to *anyone* about it - not my therapist, psychiatrist, anyone. 


""Yup. This. I don't think I'll ever feel comfortable in a conversation where dick size comes up. Ever.



I know I'm not that bad (between 5.5-6inches length and below average girth), and that some guys have it much worse, but it's still a difficult thing to deal with. Hearing girls talk about feeling ""filled up"" and the feeling in general of a ""fat cock"" is like getting punched in the gut. But of course, you have to feign indifference. ""Confidence."" If you act like it affects you at all, then you're not ""confident,"" and ""there's no greater turn-off.""



So yeah, even if it kills you on the inside, don't you dare show it.



And girls just don't get it. There's really nothing that compares. Nothing. Not weight. Height (men don't care). Bra size (breast augmentation is cheap, safe, and easy - I would quite literally write a 6 figure check this instant for equivalent surgery for my penis. no joke I'd pay literally anything.)



I can't even talk about this shit with my therapist. I just can't get the words - ""I'm insecure about my dick and it causes me to drive people away and reject intimacy"" - to come out of my mouth.""


EDIT: I'd like to thank everyone for the comments. I have a lot to think about. A lot of them were definitely reassuring. Also, I want everyone to know that I'm aware of how whiny all this sounds and that I know my ""issue"" is small (heh) compared to what others face. Hell, looking at the front page of OffMyChest right now there are several more worrisome posts; there's even *another* guy complaining about his dick! (brohug dude, if you read this, I know how you feel)

But for some reason I can't help but wonder that for every one person posting about how it doesn't matter to them, or whatever, there's any number of other people reading my post and thinking ""yup, my personal experiences and preferences totally confirm all of this guys' insecurities, poor fella"" and who will then move on to another post. Most people won't go out of their way to hurt someone's feelings without a decent reason. For all I know, the 100 or so comments here saying one thing could just be a vocal minority. Or maybe my brain is being a huge dick (heh) again. 

But, of course, that's to be expected, and is perfectly reasonable. Of course people have preferences! And that's ok, you can't fault them. But how can I connect with someone, open myself up to them, to the point where we're going to have sex and then they turn out to be one of those people whose preferences don't exactly match up with my junk. And then then there's crippling inadequacy, rejection, emasculation, all that good stuff. How will you know that you won't end up like this dude http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1dfkuz/having_issues_adjusting_back_to_husbands_penis/

I suppose it comes down to sucking it up and taking a risk, I guess. When the pants drop I'll either be enough or I wont - and I just have to learn to accept the possibility of the latter. Scary shit.

When you jumped on a plane with your young wife, you underestimated me.  The horrible court battles won our kids the right to stay here and finish growing up at home. The internal battles not to say anything negative about you â even though you tore my heart out of my chest.  Never responding with the rumors around town about you and your shitty âphoto shootsâ.  Learning how to raise a man once his own father walked away to chase his own dreams. Fighting every step of the way to make sure that boy survived high school only to watch his devastation when you didn't come for his graduation.  He was luckier because he was older, you had been there longer and I was blessed to find other boys who gathered around him and helped. You thought I would screw him up but he turned out to be a funny, ambitious, wonderful man.

Then it was her turn - our dark dark girl.  You werenât there when I found her tumblr full of cutting and suicide and awful, scary pictures. You werenât there as she sobbed and screamed and fought me. You werenât there when I tracked down the kids who were giving her drugs and explained very plainly I would end them if they ever gave her another pill.  You werenât there to hear her wake up from nightmares, to see her shake and cry pitifully into her stuffed tiger. You werenât there that winter break that I made her come to work with me every day because I was afraid if I left her alone she would kill herself. You werenât there to see the awful dirty looks she would give me.  You couldnât know how heartbreaking it was for me as she would try to get me to throw things at her or scream at her â because she was used to you doing that to her. 

As you cuddled up to your wife at night, I went to bed alone. I was so determined to get both of our babies safely into adulthood I knew I couldnât complicate things by seeking out a partner who might make my life easier but would absolutely destroy theirs â like you did.

The years I worked three jobs, the 6 months I lived off of bologna and carrots so I could feed them. The times my body would simply stop working and Iâd have to sleep for a day just to catch up.  All of the medical bills for her asthma and for him the time he broke both of his wrists and his elbow. The million different expenses that come up during the school year and the cost of keeping them in our beautiful but so expensive travel destination town.

You didnât experience the pain of him moving out to be on his own. The first pangs of empty nest.  You had kicked them out of your nest years ago so how could you know what it felt like to keep buying tons of groceries thinking you were still feeding an 19 year old boy â only to find it rotting in the fridge because your daughter and I couldnât eat it fast enough.

Finally, you werenât there when she came out as gay.  This was the hardest part.  My faith based upbringing went to war against what our daughter said she was.  I felt so scared for her, so unsure on what to do or say and so completely certain I was a terrible mother because I didnât agree with that bullshit line âat the end of the day, I just want my kid to be happyâ.  You missed out on all of our arguments as I fought to catch up and felt so deeply uncool.  You werenât there for the Monday nights with Amanda and Arnie and Ben as we worked through each of the issues.  You werenât there when she sobbed out her story of being molested by three different people. You didnât hold her as she explained she was just so afraid of men and your heart didnât break as you felt like a callous ass for not always supporting her wanting to be with Melanie instead of a boy.

When you get here tomorrow I will be as generous and as open as I can of your time with our children because it is what is best for them â even at 20 and 18 they crave their fathers love so much.  You have five days to make up for so much lost time.  I will support you the best that I can and I will mediate for you as you fight and struggle like you always do.  I know you will not expect this because, as always, you underestimate me.

I was the one who kept everything moving, even more so than you understand.  I do a lot of work behind the scenes and under the radar - even in such a small office there is far more going on than you know.  I did it all without complaint.  Some of things I did you knew, but didn't truly understand: when I stayed in the office until 2:00am bringing a crashed server back online so everybody else would be able to function when they showed up at 9:00am (an hour after I showed up at 8 after staying until 2) you didn't understand that yes, it was a big deal - and you weren't happy that something was delayed for ten minutes that morning even though somebody else could have done it.

To you (and everybody else in the office) everything just works - you don't know about all of the time spend updating and patching and removing viruses that were downloaded by clicking on stupid things.  But you know that I'm to blame somehow for not guaranteeing that icons aren't guaranteed to stay in the same place on your desktop.

You are aware, but it never registered that I'm the one who is on call 24/7.  You don't understand what that means, but I do: it means that you didn't get yelled at by our clients for not being available.  It means that there are probably over a thousand professional association complaints that were never filed because I made things right.  It means that I was able to prevent several hundred thousands of dollars of damages.

You are aware, but it doesn't click that I haven't had a real vacation since I started here because even when I was off I was still working remotely.  You aren't aware that my perpetual, instant availability meant that I would be doing my job via texting while having a root canal.

But you are perfectly aware that I didn't get a raise these past couple of years due to a downturn in the industry.  But you managed to find raises for other people.  The guys I oversee - the ones who make everything possible haven't had a raise in a couple of years either.  I know you wish you didn't have to hire them or pay them anything at all but they are essential to operations if you want to maintain the reputation as one of the best in the country.  You don't know (or even care to know) how I keep them reasonably content and not loathing every moment of their job.  It isn't easy, but I manage it.  Want to know why you have such low turnover in that department?  Me.  And they're hurting too.  But they are still willing to stick it out - largely because I convinced you that some of your ideas were bad ones.

And then came a salary cut for me.  I'm barely keeping up with inflation and insurance - I can make it work because I'm good at stretching resources, but it is getting tougher and I'm feeling the pinch.

But then yesterday.  You completely overreacted to a non-existent problem that I had already prevented and you told me that I'm not supposed to be doing something that I've been doing for years.  Once again you took out stress and frustration over something that isn't a big deal on me.  I am very good at getting things done, but I invited you to review the issue before I took action but you said you were too busy and told me to handle it so I did, like I always do.  It had to get done and in this past this has never been an issue.  I tried to explain but you didn't care.  You were rude (unusual for you), wouldn't listen to a thing I had to say and simply said that I'm not allowed to do that anymore because that's something that ONLY you can do.  Ok, so what am I left to do?  You clearly think you don't need me anymore, so it is time to go.

At one point we were good friends, but then you made choices and kind of left me behind.  Even back then you weren't very sensitive - you'd introduce me as your right hand man but follow that up with ""but I don't know what he does"".  I am **very** good at what I do - people in the industry and out recognize it.  I've even been a keynote speaker at a trade organization that covers what I do but you never cared enough to know that it happened.  I have polished *your* reputation to the point when a case gets assigned to us people breathe a sigh of relief because in the area I am widely considered to be one of the very best.  When I leave that isn't going to last very long because you're going to become just like everybody else.

And I have much, much, much more to offer than what you are utilizing.  I'm not a perfect fit for everybody so it is going to be a little tricky to find somebody who fully appreciates me, but in the meantime I'm at the point where the first job offer that will cover the bills will be taken no matter what.  I'm sorry that it is going to end like this, but I have to respect myself more than to stay here.

I'm an insomniac, I keep a pretty different sleep schedule, generally going to bed at eight in the morning and waking up around two in the afternoon for work. An hour after falling asleep, I was woken up by screaming in the next room from my sister. ""He's not waking up! He's not waking up! Baby, wake up!"" I lunged out of bed and ran into the room next door to find my older sister hysterical over her boyfriend who was blue and slumped in the bed.

By the time I got a good look at him, my mother and father had run up the steps to see what was happening. My dad helped me and my sister pull her boyfriend onto the floor; he had no pulse, wasn't breathing, but was still warm. I began CPR on him, though not remembering everything I had been taught while in the heat of the moment (I went to vocational school for Public Safety).

There was no immediate response.

His lips were blue, his face was gray, his whole body was limp.

I kept giving CPR but at that point, I thought I was just beating up on a corpse. My sister was screaming, my mother was on the phone with 911, and I was still going with the CPR - occasionally administering rescue breaths.

I didn't piece it together at that moment: the problem.

My sister outright said, while I continued working on her boyfriend, ""He's a heroin addict!"" I had known he had used on and off but I stupidly and selfishly never thought it was my place to tell anybody; I know, a bad choice on my part.

About two minutes into my CPR, he began gurgling and wheezing. His pulse came back in his neck and wrist, albeit weak.

The ambulance arrived at that point, along with a barrage of police officers. I was still administering CPR, asked the cop to relieve me which he wouldn't, and instead, was questioned about where the drugs were. My sister handed over the stash and finally a paramedic took over. At that time, I went out to comfort my family in the hallway while the cops stood around slack-jawed, not doing a damn thing with quite a few of the other first responders.

I was cradling my sister against the wall when I heard a familiar voice, her boyfriend, telling them he didn't know what he had taken. A second later, the young man I had thought was definitely done and gone was up on his own two feet - helped up and out of the room. I told my sister to look up, just so she could see he was up and awake.

We spent about six hours in the hospital, treated poorly by staff aside from one volunteer, and still fuming about the treatment from the police officers (I didn't get into half of the story with them, for my sake).

By the time we returned from the hospital, we had a family meeting, along with a visit to the police station because they have decided to charge my sister's boyfriend with three counts I won't get into. I plan on going in to file a formal complaint about the Police Sergeant I dealt with later today.

Regardless, I am just not in a proper state of mind. I cannot process anything. My chest is tight, my heart hurts literally, my stomach is in a knot. I spent most of the day throwing up and crying. I cannot get the visual of my sister's boyfriend (who I consider a good friend and a family member) blue and dead right before me. I cannot rest or fall asleep, I instead just want to keep checking in on the two to make sure he's there - alive, breathing, heart beating.

This is a rambled mess because of my scattered emotions at the moment. I'm so worried about so many things along with the fact that my brain just cannot process the fact that he was dead for at least three minutes and is now supposedly just fine.

I cannot talk to my family about it at the moment because we're all coping and those few trusted individuals that I have spoken to were of no help and just gave me generic answers. I'm hoping somebody here (not hoping, that sounds awful) has experienced something similar, who understands, who actually has something that feels fruitful to tell me.

The EMTs pushed past me to the elderly woman unconscious in her bed.  She lay there with her eyes closed, breathing heavily.  Her skin was pale underneath her pink pajamas.  The stench of urine hung on her wet pants.

I watched as the EMTs attempted and reattempted intubating her.  Red mucus oozed from the side of her mouth as she groaned.  Her breasts toppled from under her shirt as they hastily placed EKG leads, and in all the chaos, her IV had been yanked out of place.  Blood gushed on to the floor.

I thought to myself, âHow can this happen here?â  It felt wrong.  This was her home, her sacred place.  She was in a room full of love, comfort, stuffed animals, yet here she was in this undignified manner â white, mountainous breasts heaving rapidly as she struggled for air; pants wet with urine and blood.

I can't keep this bottled up inside me any longer. Don't bother reporting me to the authorities, as I'm using multiple proxies on this account. 

I first noticed I was attracted to children in early adolescence. It was in 8th grade that I realized the facial features and body structure of girls 5-12 were more aesthetically appealing to me than those of girls my age. I began masturbating exclusively to fantasies involving young girls at this time. I didn't put much thought into this, and figured it was just a phase that would pass eventually. It didn't. 

As I grew older and entered High School, I found it increasingly more difficult to relate to teenage girls. In contrast to younger girls, they seemed awfully incurious, egotistical, and superficial. My 2 attempts at getting a girlfriend failed miserably- there was no emotional or romantic connection between us whatsoever, and the relationships fell apart almost immediately. I fell into a deep depression, stopped interacting with my friends, and began spending most of my time on the Internet, playing online games and masturbating to preteen models. I felt deeply ashamed of my sexuality, but remained hopeful that it was just the result of excessive hormones and that in due time I would become normal. But I didn't.

When I was 17, my female 8 year old step-cousin temporarily moved in to our house while her parents were going through a divorce. She was the most beautiful little girl that I had ever seen. Her deep sincerity, kindness, curiosity, and sense of humor were absolutely intoxicating. Nothing made me happier than making her laugh and smile. I wanted no more out of life than to spend time with her and make her happy. Every waking moment was spent either thinking about her or being with her, and when I went to sleep, she would appear in my dreams. The sheer intensity of my attraction to her was unlike anything I had ever experienced before, and it scared me, but I didn't know what to do. I would have sooner killed myself than ever cause her any harm- the idea of sexually abusing her was repulsive, and I never entertained the possibility even once. But I won't lie- getting a blowjob from another teenager at a party didn't even come close to the pleasure I got from her hugs and kisses (none of which, by the way, were initiated by myself). Every night I masturbated to fantasies of kissing and cuddling her naked body- this repulsed me so much that I began cutting myself whenever I felt the urge to think about her in a sexual manner, hoping that via negative operant conditioning the pedophilia would go away. But it didn't. After 3 months had passed, it was time for her to go back home. She pleaded her mother to stay with us forever, but this was impossible. I've never seen two human beings cry as bitterly as we did on her last day at our house. As I watched her drive off into the distance, I felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest. My depression rebounded and became worse than I could ever imagine.

I turned 18 last week, and my age of attraction has still not changed. The faint hope that this was some kind of temporary phase has disappeared. I am faced with the terrifying fact that I am a pedophile. Just writing those words makes me feel dizzy and sick to my stomach. All of my relationships with other people are fake- they don't know who I really am, and if they did, they would fear and loathe me at best and disown me entirely at worst.  I can't look people in the eyes anymore. My entire life is a lie. I don't know if I can take this for much longer. 

In the past, I saved on my computer images depicting little girls in the nude. Although there was no penetration involved, the legal definition of child pornography extends to any image involving children which stimulates sexual arousal- a vague and arbitrary definition that could put me in jail for many years. I deleted the pictures a long time ago, but the only way to ensure they are gone for sure is to wipe or physically destroy my hard drive. My family is not very wealthy- we only have one computer and we can't afford a new HDD, but neither can I wipe it clean, as this would delete files necessary for my parents' occupation. 

Child pornography possession is punished with draconian prison sentences in the US. I would rather kill myself than spend years if not decades being beaten, raped, tortured, and humiliated, away from my friends and family, and when it's over, be branded as a pervert and degenerate until the day I die. 

I can't look at a police car without feeling physically ill. Last week, I saw sirens in my window and lost consciousness. My parents took me to the doctor, but what was I supposed to say? I live in constant terror that at any moment, men with assault rifles will break into our house and ruin my life forever. I often think about what I would do if that day finally comes. My father keeps a loaded gun in the attic in case of an emergency. Sometimes I put it in my mouth and taste it. I don't believe in a God or an afterlife, and I'm pretty sure that when you die, your consciousness simply disappears. I used to afraid of death. But there comes a point when the shame, self-loathing, and humiliation outweighs the fear. I know that if I ever get a knock on my door and hear ""FBI"", I will put the gun to my head and pull the trigger. 

And even if that day never comes, I'm still a pedophile. I am doomed to a life of loneliness, secrecy, and shame. This is not a life I want to live. I wish I could change, but there is no cure.  I wouldn't wish this onto anybody. I love how the gun tastes in my mouth. One of these days, I'll finally get enough courage to shoot myself. Who knows... Maybe there is an afterlife. And maybe someday I'll meet her there, and all of this will seem like some strange fever dream...",,False,,t5_2ranw,False,,,True,t3_1adma8,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1adma8/im_a_pedophile/,

and I posted this from my phone.
Then YES my computer is dead because of a virus and reinstalling windows won't do anything. I showed it to sevetal people working in conputer repair and all told me I'd better throw it away. From whay I've understood, I had a virus that caused my computer to run certain things that should not and allowed it to heat too much, that causing several things inside to, well, burn. It's a laptop so some pieces can't be changed and repairing it would be more expensive than buying a new one.
So reinstalling windows is really pointless as I can't even turn my computer on.

Stop it - sometimes it's nice to just talk and sometimes it's nice to listen to what other people are passionate about instead of turning every situation into an excuse to take ""requests"" and start a sing-along.  

Every time you have the sudden urge to masturbate all over a set of strings, how about asking someone else what they like to do on their time off?  How about telling everyone a funny story or an amusing limerick and then listening to THEIR amusing story.

The point is that he did; he took took an entire bottle of vicodin (26, or 13000mg acetaminophen, 130 mg hydrocodone) from his mother's room and downed it with vodka. I went to him as soon as I figured out what he was doing. At first, I thought he had only taken 6--then I realized he took all of them. I called Alex, his best friend. We were both crying and were going to call an ambulance and tell his mother, who was directly downstairs.

We didn't tell her. We did not call for medical help. He told us that if he did he was going to slit his throat. We were able to convince him that he should not die. He was open to medical attention. But then the thought of his mother knowing caused him to get frantic.

...I should have told her. I should have called them. We should have not just sat next to him and watch him die.

We don't know how he is still alive. We ended up calling an ambulance the day after, at 2000 while his parents were in Cleveland--his sister, the person who raised him basically, knew. I called her, and they brought him to the hospital. They had to call his parents in order for him to get any treatment, because he is a minor.

I've been talking to his mom ever since over text. She is not mad, it does not seem, but hurt. I had to tell his mother myself, over a phone, that his son tried to kill himself with medication from her room, and that I could not tell her because he threatened to slit his throat. She trusted me. I trusted myself to do what was best for him, and I didn't. I should have called the ambulance. I should have told his mother as soon as it happened. I SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING.

But I didn't. And now he is suffering in a hospital bed with no outside communication with anyone besides his parents with liver and stomach failure. He's doing worse, he is dying. After treatment, he will be in a psych evaluation facility for a minimum of 72 hours.

If I had said something, it would not have been so bad. His liver would not be so taxed. He would not be so close to death. I love him, and I did something that probably makes everyone else who does hate me.

I should have done something.

I can't tell anyone this so I made a throwaway account. 

I spent the night at a friends house. I am 21. She and I got pretty drunk, but nothing over the top, just drunk enough. She wanted her boyfriend to come over so I said that was fine and I'd just sleep in one of the vacant rooms in her house so they could be together. Well we hung out or whatever and then it was like 2 am so I figured I would go to bed in the empty room. They probably wanted to be alone anyways.

I don't know what time it was but I woke up to a figure climbing in bed with me. I asked who it was and he told me. It was my friends boyfriend. I have been with the same man for 4 years. So I was very upset when her boyfriend climbed into the bed. I told him he was in the wrong room. I was drunk and I am very small, so I was trying to shove him but he wouldn't move.

I'm going to go into detail because I feel like maybe it will help me get it out of my head. I cand stop thinking about the whole thing and I want to stop thinking about it, but whenever my mind wanders I just think of it. 

Anyways, he told me he knew where he was and I started to shout for my friend. He hit me. I think my friend was probably passed out drunk because I screamed and she didn't come. He hit me again, and I started to swing, but he is twice my size. During this he was holding me down with one hand and removing my underwear and pants. I screamed more before he stuffed my panties into my mouth. If I wasn't drunk I think I could have stopped this. I'm so pissed at myself. I feel like such trash. 

I tried to spit the panties out, but when I did manage to get them out he just stuffed them back in and covered my mouth. I was scared I would choke so I stopped. The screaming hadn't done anything for me previously. He started laughing at me. I was crying, and he was laughing. Then he started jamming his fingers inside of me. I tried to squirm away from him and he hit me again. I tried to convince myself that I could still get away. So I kept moving, then he let go of my hands and started choking me. I clawed at his arms but he kept choking me. I thought I was really going to die so I stopped fighting him. He told me I made a good choice and let go of my throat. I was so scared, I just gave up and I thought that if I just did what he wanted I would just be raped and I wouldn't die. I hate myself for this. I let him do what he wanted. 

He kept spitting in his hand and wiping it on me. He told me I wasn't wet enough, and kept smacking me down there. Then he stuck it in. I remember everything. The way he smelled, his face. All I could do was analyze the situation. It felt so unreal. He lifted my bottom half up and told me to watch as he raped me. 

I thought it was over after that because he pulled out and came on me, but he flipped me over and started touching my bottom. I fought more because I did not want that. He started choking me again. This time until I nearly passed out. He then put himself inside of my anus. The pain was horrible. He called me a whore. He squeezed my nipples so hard I bruised. He finished inside and then went back to raping me vaginally. He came inside of me three times. After that he left. I laid there for a long time and checked my phone. It was 5 am. I knew I was too drunk to drive, I was exhausted and bleeding from the rape so I just ended up falling asleep.

I woke up at 8 am. I got my stuff and left. My friend texted me later and said she was sorry that she wasn't awake when I left. I told her it was fine. When I got home I took a shower and my boyfriend asked me what the hell happened to me, because he could see my bruises and my lip was split. I told him I fell on the stairs because I was drunk. He laughed at me, and said he was sorry. 

After he went to work I went to the clinic. I didn't tell them I was raped, but I think they knew. They did an std test, and I got the morning after pill. I am ovulating right now so I don't know how effective it will be. My boyfriend wanted to have sex two day later, and I agreed. Before this we used to have slightly kinky sex, but I told him I just wanted to have normal sex with lots of kissing and hugging. He thought it was weird, but I didn't want to deny him because he didn't do anything to me. I wanted to have sex so that if I am pregnant he won't think it's strange. I know that makes me a horrible person, but my rapist is Mexican and if I am pregnant I will get an abortion.

I can't tell my boyfriend. He has been cheated on in the past, and I feel like I didn't try hard enough to stop the rape. I'm scared he won't be attracted to me anymore because that person raped me. My family is very judgmental and I can't tell them. I will never go to the police, I was drunk, I'll be labeled a whore. He told me that if I tell anyone he'll lie and say I came on to him. I don't want to report it so please don't tell me to.

I just needed to tell anyone this story. I'm sorry if it graphic. I just want to stop thinking of it. I want it to be quietly swept under the rug. ",,False,,t5_2ranw,False,,,True,t3_1bpknq,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1bpknq/i_was_raped_please_help_vivid_description_please/,

You.  And your hippie bullshit.

There, I said it.  I don't like you already.  Not because you're a ""monkey"" sign in the Chinese calendar and I'm a ""tiger"" sign, but because you're a motherfucking idiot that judges people based on made up crap.

You're a hypocrite because you spent basically an hour talking about how good of a person you are doing this whole route of positivity and yoga and how you want to spend your life helping people but then turn around and judge every single person based on:

* Their drug history

* Their travel history (seriously, I do not care that you went backpacking in Europe.  I do not think more or less of you for it.  And I do not think it reflects ANYTHING about my character or your character if I've traveled less or more than you. Which I have, but didn't say because I didn't want to get pulled into your hipster bullshit.  I DO think less of you for making an issue of it.  What if we had a friend that lived in a small town and never went outside of it but was happy?  And not everyone has the money for that.  Don't be a dick.)

* Their physical attractiveness (I wanted to duct tape your mouth when you spend several minutes going on and on and on and on about your workout routine).  On that note, I would be happy if you never stared at my chest or talked about my hair again.  Thanks.

* Talking about how you want to be a force of good in life when you were a fucking drug dealer and talked about helping the other girl we were hanging out with getting into the weed business.  I work for law enforcement.  Might want to shut up about that.  Also, considering that I had a case where an underage kid got shot and killed over a pound of weed, I think you don't get to take the moral high ground by feeding into the black market.  We could talk about how legalization would prevent those cases from happening and that it's the illegality itself that creates those situations, but I doubt you would have the patience and intelligence to understand those nuances and how maybe your well-off middle class white boy desires to not ""struggle"" financially wasn't a good excuse to deal drugs.  At least be honest about how you put yourself before others, then I wouldn't have a problem.  Everyone hurts people.  It's a fact of life and society that at some point from the clothes you wear to the food you eat to what you do, etc. etc. that you're going to hurt someone.  To deny that is to put yourself on a holier than thou pedestal and it's sad, laughable bullshit.

* Astrology is bullshit.  Need I repeat that?

In short, listening to you made me want to shoot myself in the face.

I am tired of being around judgemental hypocrites like you.  And ugh, I wish I didn't respond to your friend request because I want to take you off Facebook so badly now.  Your posts and wall make me gag with how much New Age holier than thou crap is spewing all over it.

But good for you, man.  Good for you that you're trying to change yourself and you seem to find some things working for you.  Good for you that you're really excited about it and want to share.  But you still seem to have a lot to learn about being a good to other people.  I would say all of this to your face, but I don't want to embarrass our mutual friends.  Eh, I might anyway.

Some background: I grew up in the Bible Belt. My entire family is quite religious (prayer before every meal, church every Sunday, very conservative). I was heavily involved in religious stuff until March 2011. Before that time, I never really thought about politics or anything. I actually voted McCain in 2008 without ever looking at a platform; I did it solely because I was raised Republican. Once I stopped going to religious things, I started thinking for myself. I started drinking and having challenging conversations. Then I started having these conversations whilst I was sober. I started hanging with different groups of people who had different ideologies than me. I began to see gay people as simply people; they no longer needing fixing. They were beautiful as they are. I began to think about how I can make a difference in the world. I started giving my time and money to help other people.

About a year ago I decided I was going to make an educated vote for this election. I started to look at the issues then think about my thoughts on them. After my research, it was clear that I was a Democrat. I never had the balls to really say that or broadcast it because of ""what people might think"" (remember...Bible Belt. And by heavily involved with religious stuff, I mean *heavily* involved).

In August, I moved to Australia. I have been here for 3 months and living in a hostel full-time. For any American who has ever lived in a hostel, it becomes obvious quite quickly that we aren't very well liked. With this being my first time out of the country, I really began to examine the American lifestyle. I heard what non-Americans had to say about us. I had insightful discussions with people with different backgrounds, religions, work ethics, political platforms.

It was depressing to hop back on Facebook and see things people posted in the pre-election days. I saw statuses saying that ""if you're a **true** Christian, you're against the gays"" and ""somebody needs to take that Muslim out"". Then I saw [this article](http://www.classwarfareexists.com/texas-church-vote-for-the-mormon-not-the-muslim-the-capitalist-not-the-communist/#axzz2BbRZs6Ry) and I could no longer stand it. The ignorance of fellow Americans killed me.

So then Election Day rolls around. I saw stuff [like this](http://imgur.com/1WOVR) almost everywhere. I saw some of my ""friends"" call Obama the anti-Christ. I saw someone say that the rest of the world was laughing at us because we re-elected Obama (almost every person in my hostel was so excited about it, lulz). Then the statuses about moving to another country started coming out. I'm thinking, ""awesome! That's gonna open their eyes and give them perspective"". Then I saw [this tweet](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/confused-so-was-kristen-neel-20121108-28zhi.html) from a lovely fellow Georgian and just about lost it. Not only are some of my friends ignorant enough to bad-mouth the president and blame him for everything, but they were also too fuckin' lazy to research some of the countries they wanted to move to (Canada and Australia are both more left-wing than the US, kids).

I was able to witness the Election from another country. A country that's across the world but cared more about my election than some of my American friends did. They were more knowledgeable about certain issues than myself. And for the first time in my life, I finally saw the true reasons that non-Americans call us the most ignorant country around. And it was upsetting.

I know this is really jumbled and probably makes no sense. But I needed to tell someone.

Also, if you voted for Romney, I'm not calling you an idiot or ignorant. I saw ridiculous statuses across the board. My eyes were finally opened to just how egocentric Americans can be.

Five years later, barely 18, I'm walking down the street when a man pulls a knife on me. He was young, younger than me. Holding his knife poorly and had no fighting stance. A minute later he was on his knees, me behind him with my knife at his throat. I could have just walked away. I could have just taken his knife from him and walked away. I didn't, I dug the serrations in and ripped my arm out and back. Then stood there and watched him die. In court all charges where dropped as he came at me first. But every day since, its all I can think about. When I'm alone at night, I still hear him gargling and choking on his own blood. Whenever I seek professional help or just talk to someone they say I had every right as he attacked my with a deadly weapon. But I cant. I may have had the legal right to do so. To be judge, jury, and executioner. But it eats away at me, I could have walked away. Why didn't I? He was just a kid, 16 years old. I could have gotten him help. But I didn't. I executed him, and at the time, liked it. I hate myself for it.",,False,,t5_2ranw,False,,,True,t3_14tgot,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14tgot/i_executed_a_man/,

You can't be real.,throw_me_away_crazy,194,22,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1awhrp/this_cant_be_real_you_cant_be_real/,"I was sexually abused at 9 years old by a family member. I cut and went through eating disorders and drank my way to 18 years old, and after a half-assed suicide attempt started to heal. I didn't touch a boy until 18, when I got my first kiss. I couldn't date until 20, when I stumbled into a halfway decent 2 year relationship. The guy liked me, but he liked himself more. He ended up falling in love with me, but nothing came naturally. He admitted to not being physically attracted to me, I wasn't his type, etc. etc. He never initiated anything. He never surprised me with anything. I paid for everything. He wasn't mean to me. In fact, he treated me pretty well. But he was more than happy to take from me over and over. I'm a giving person, and I gave. Financially, sexually, emotionally, until I had nothing left to give.

I met you 8 months ago, while I was still dating him, and I knew the night I met you, when you started reeling off the answers to team trivia without any hesitation, that you sparked something in me. You were so fucking smart. So incredibly smart. But you were above me. I spent the next 6 months seeing you weekly with my group of friends for trivia, and occasionally out at the bars, thinking to myself that you were something incredibly fucking special. I avoided you at all costs, because I knew I wanted you. I was drawn to you, and it was terrifying. I loved my boyfriend, I really did, but I... was drawn to you. You made a few comments here and there that you felt I wasn't being treated properly by my boyfriend, and I took them as friendly advice. My entire group of friends (his friends, really), hated how he treated me, after all.

2 months ago, I got too drunk. You had to take care of me. I woke up in your bed, you were sleeping on the futon because you're a fucking gentleman. You explained I tried to kiss you, and that I was not in the right state of mind and I was taken. You respected me and my relationship. We started studying together, we started talking casually, and I knew the spark I felt was... real. I fell way faster than I'll ever admit to you. All it took was my boyfriend failing to acknowledge our 2 year anniversary and I was finally able to walk away. I hated myself for hurting him, and you told me you knew I liked you but you weren't sure how you felt about me. You didn't consider me while I was taken, and now that I was single, you weren't sure.

I find out later that you've been burned. The only girl you've ever been with left her boyfriend for you, but went back to him within months. Was probably with him the whole time. You took a few weeks to come around, but when you finally decided I was worth the risk, you... you took me out to the lake with a cheap bottle of wine. You don't even like wine, and make fun of me for drinking out of the bottle because it's not classy like you are. I'm not classy like you are. We sat on the frozen lake, and you told me you wanted to pursue this under the stars. You started taking me on dates. Buying me lunch. Doing dishes with me. Holding me. Actually putting your hands on me when we kiss, my last relationship had none of that. You're... attracted to me. You surprise me with coffee and my favorite ice cream. You hold my hand. You say sweet things and you're supporting in my ventures.

My whole entire life I struggled with loving myself. I still don't. But I came to terms with being a giver, and uh. I figured people like to take, right? I assumed my long term future was with someone like my ex, who was nice to me, who loved me, and who took. Not intentionally, but just took because I was offering. I spent years coming to terms with that, and I finally did. I felt with my past, my sexual abuse and my scars, that wasn't a bad deal. Someone who loves me, someone who treats me decently, someone who takes unintentionally.

And now you. I have tears in my eyes typing this. You're not real. This isn't. Real. I'm a loud, social, sarcastic chick hoping some medical school is dumb enough to accept me who drinks wine from the bottle and dances around with no pants on to stupid music. You're an introverted, classy law student, family-oriented, extremely motivated and focused on your future to the point where you often don't have fun. And you adore me. You're drawn to me. I can feel it. You always want to be near me. To have a hand on me. To be holding me. You're ... excited to introduce me to your family and your friends. You're proud of me. You're proud to have me. You surprise me with things. You remember what I say. My favorites. My preferences. You not only accept me, you adore me and my quirks. I've known you for a while now, and since we started being us... you seem happier. I make you happy. This was never going to happen to me, not after everything I've been through. Pinch me. Fucking pinch me. I don't even want to quantify how happy I am. I continually feel like I'm going to wake up tomorrow and it's going to be gone. Joke's on me. Boys like you don't like girls like me. And girls like me are destined to a lifetime of mediocrity, at best, because of their past.

But no. I am going to wake up tomorrow, and we're going to go meet some of your family and play video games with them all day. And you're going to continue to ... be happy. And I'm happy.

Even if it's just some bum, even if they're full of shit, everyone has a really fascinating story, and meeting someone weird or interesting gives character to the human race.

A cul-de-sac with no parked cars. Making an uninterrupted u-turn is pretty nice.

Being friends with an attractive member of the opposite sex with no sexual tension or unrequited feelings. Just legit friends. It's always made me feel mature for whatever childish reason.

The piano. I can't play. I mean, I can a bit, but not really. When I hear a really beautiful piano song, I can't help, for whatever reason, but reflect on good and enriching memories.

My imagination. I try to come up with a context for everything I observe, every person I meet. It keeps me grounded. Even if what I imagine is super far from the truth, it helps me put myself in someone else's shoes, and keeps me from being too much of a cynical, judgmental asshole.

The cold shoulder in LA. I can be pretty miserable sometimes, and this place can be pretty awful. It's actually nice to think that when I say to myself, ""Fuck you, Los Angeles,"" the city is saying, ""Yeah, well, fuck you, too, buddy."" It's hard to describe, it honestly helps me feel at home in a really weird place.

Thai food, Korean food, Japanese food, the fact that I live half an hour away from pretty much every conceivable culture. The fact that in this place, I'm so rarely the majority, there's so rarely homogenization.

Sharing my life with an eclectic, intelligent, and creative group of people. I can be a bit of a shut-in for stretches, but knowing that those people are there, knowing that we can have a deep, personal conversation, or just shoot the shit and have a laugh, that's what life is all about.

Knowing that these things make me happy. Knowing that these things are important to me (besides the cul-de-sac.

The guy didn't want insurance or cops involved. I insisted on both.  The day after the accident, the guy who hit comes by and wants to know if I would settle without going through insurance. I decline. About and hour later the guy and his dad show up, and he comes off like a politician trying to get his son a senate seat.  I still insist on going through my insurance company.

They seem rich, and I'm just a grad student, so I know I couldn't ""out lawyer"" them.   I was fine listening to their pleas of avoiding insurance until his dad delivered the titular line.

I was asleep like everyone else in the house at this point in time. Suddenly I heard sounds coming from the master bedroom, where my mother and father sleep. It was truly awful and nightmarish; I heard desperate gasps for air mixed with my mother crying out my fathers name. At first I was not sure if it was actually happening. I was asleep right before it happened, after all, so initially I assumed I was having a nightmare.

Unfortunately, though, it was all too real. I jumped straight out of my bed and put on a pair of boxers. Right after that I snatched my phone ofd my desk in case I needed to call the emergency phone number. I left my room starting the most nightmarish experience of my life. The lights were already turned on in the master bedroom, which gave me a clear view of what was going on.

My father just laid there on his side of the bed. He was neither breathing or moving. He was justâ¦ lifeless. My mother didn't stop to think for a single moment. Like me she immediately knew that this was very serious and possibly fatal. She started the CPR sequence right away and I called the emergency number.

I got hold of the emergency number right away and told them what happened. I emphasised that the situation was very urgent, since we were attempting to make my dad breathe again. If he didn't start to breathe again he would either die or survive with significant brain damage. Ocassionally he would gasp for air, which was comforting to some extent, but he just wasn't breathing enough to stay alive unaided.

The person on the other end of the line was very comforting and patient. I was totally stressing out as I was literally watching my father die. Just right in front of my eyes. He then told me an ambulance was near and on its way and requested me to put my phone on speaker so that he could give instructions to my mother. He also had to keep her calm because she was very close to the verge of panicking. After all, she was watching her husband die and his life laid in her hands.

My mother instructed me to remove the pedestal cupboard from my fathers' side of the room. He was banging his head against it every time my mother performed CPR movements. It was a truly awful sight.

I was then instructed to clear a path for the paramedics that were soon arriving. I needed to open the front door and had to make sure they could find the place. I stood outside in front of my house wearing nothing other than boxers and trackpants. The adrenaline was rushing through my body so I didn't notice that it was actually really cold outside. Within a minute people arrived at the spot. At first they seemed lost in my neighbourhood, but as soon as they noticed a shirtless guy in the middle of the street waving at them, they ran to my house as quick as they could. When they reached my front door I told them to go upstairs. I would remain outside to make sure every additional unit would be able to find the place.

I didn't dare to go upstairs and come to think of it, I'm glad of that. If I were to go upstairs I would probably only get in the way of the professionals and the experience of seeing my father being shocked by an AED device would only make everything more traumatizing. 

In the meantime my brother had woken up. Actually he never went to sleep that night because he was working on a important school assignment. His bedroom is on the attic, which was the reason why it took him a little longer to realise something was going on downstairs. He then got the scare of his life when he saw my fathers' lifeless body being surrounded by a number of paramedics with an AED device. He continued on to go to the living room because he also figured he could only get in the way at that point.

I waited downstairs in the living room sitting down on the sofa. A police officer came in to comfort me and my mother and brother, who walked in shortly after I did. She also needed information about my fathers' medical records and current condition. We also needed to hand her my dads' insurance pass and ID card, as well as the medication he took on a daily basis.

After we helped the officer get the information, all we could do was wait. My dad was in the hands of the professionals now and he would soon be brought to a hospital. The officers were in the meantime also looking for a proper way out. They contemplated getting my dad outside through my window, but in the end they decided that the hallway would do. They lacked the equipment to get my dad outside through the window anyway.

Then yet another traumatizing event took place in front of my eyes. I could clearly see the the hallway from where I was sitting. At a certain point I heard numerous footsteps slowly and carefully descending from the stairs. I could see the entire team of paramedics carrying a stretcher with my dad on it. He was being kept alive by several machines. This almost made me cry on sight, but I figured crying had to be reserved for later. The officers could still be needing me to provide them additional information and if I were to break down in tears right there and then I would have been practically useless.

As my dad was brought to the hospital, some paramedics had to stay behind to gather all of the supplies they may have forgotten. They had come with a second ambulance, which would take my mother to the hospital as well. They told me and my brother that we could follow his ambulance in our mothers' car if we wanted to, but strongly discouraged us from doing so. We were in no condition to drive without getting ourselves in danger.

Thus, the waiting began. We had to wait for the first subway train to leave, which would be at roughly six o' clock. I tried distracting myself from the entire situation by going on the internet, but it was no use. Everything was still so fresh in my mind, I couldn't possibly concentrate on anything else.

So me and my brother waited. And waited. It seemed like we waited for ages, while in fact we probably waited for two hours at most. Finally we were able to leave as the clock almost reached 6. We walked towards the subway station in total silence, and even when we got on the suway train we couldn't exchange a single word. It was impossible to talk about what we just witnessed, as if it were forbidden to do so.

The ride on the subway train just took way too long. Of course we wanted to see our father as soon as possible, but the train naturally needed to stop at every station. At such a moment it's just hard to realise that you're surrounded by people who are just going to their jobs, as casual as can be.

We arrived at the hospital, which is conveniently right next to the subway station. We entered the building and spent about fifteen minutes trying to find the place where my father was being kept. We finally managed to find it and were greeted by a doctor. Who explained to us what had happened in the meantime.

Apparently, my dad had a heart attack and they were now giving him the best possible treatment. This treatment would also limit the amount of brain damage that was caused by the lack of oxygen. As we speak he is being brought to a low body temperature to create some kind of artificial shock. It is supposed to trigger the body's natural reaction to save the most important organ: the brain. 

The doctors kept on praising my mother and I for taking the right actions in such a short period of time. I don't really think I deserve the praise all that much; all credit must go to my mother and her first aid knowledge. We don't know much as of this moment, but one thing is for certain: if she didn't do what she did, my dad would not have survived. Simple as that.

My father will be kept asleep for a couple of days. Nobody knows what he will be like once he wakes up. Only when he has returned to consciousness (and we're not even sure if he will) will we know what effect the heart attack has had on him and how severe the brain damage will be. For now I can only wait and let the professionals do what they're good at.

tl;dr. Dad had a heart attack last night. Traumatizing night ensues.

**Update 6-6**  
Thank you so much for the compassion, this means a lot to me. Updates have been requested, so I'll try to keep you up to date daily.

I had trouble sleeping tonight. I still cannot fully cope with the situation. Seeing my dad in such a position troubles my mind and it will keep on haunting my mind for a while.
  
I have paid another visit today, but not a lot has happened since I went to visit yesterday. He is still being kept asleep very lightly, but occasionally he regains consciousness. Every time he wakes up he tries to pull the tube out of his throat (which is a fully natural response, I'd totally do the same).
     
They are now busy bringing him back to his normal body temperature. Tomorrow morning they'll have him back at 37,5Â°C and the doctors will try to make him wake up and breathe by himself again.

**Update 7-6**  
I am pleased to announce that my dad is doing very well right now. 

In the morning he was feeling very uneasy and he tried to pull the tube out of his throat again. He had to be tied down to prevent him from succeeding.  

My mother, brother and I paid him a visit in the afternoon. Soon we were joined by other relatives as well.

We were able to have a normal conversation with him. He was still feeling a bit groggy and sleepy because of the medication, but he was able to understand the things we told him and could respond normally. He remembered his own name, who we were, what date it was and so on. All of these are great signs and reasons to assume the brain damage is limited.

The doctors confirmed he is indeed doing very well and he will soon (tomorrow if he's doing extremely well) be removed from the intensive care. Tomorrow I'll be paying him another visit to bring him some personal belongings and stuff to keep him busy.

**Update 8-6**  
He is recovering even quicker than I expected! I've read things about how long it takes for someone to recover from a heart attack and my dad is in fact doing so well that the doctors have now removed him from the intensive care.  

My brother and I paid him another visit today in his new room, which he shares with another patient. He is growing a bit impatient and just wants to go home and get back to work. We told him to take it easy; he might recover very well for now, but the doctors discovered that he is likely to have another heart attack if he does not receive treatment. While researching his heart at the night of his heart attack the doctors found that multiple arteries were clogged. One is cleared now, but the other one could still be problematic. We don't know when he will receive treatment, but we hope it will be very soon. We don't want another night like tuesday.

We helped him with getting his tv to work, so at least he'll have something to do for now. We were surprised to see that his memory his working perfectly for the most part. To get the tv to work, you have to call and give a bunch of information, such as your name, date of birth, home address and even bank account number. He remembered all of those things perfectly. It seems as though that his recent memory has been lost; he couldn't remember what he did on tuesday or that we came to visit yesterday, but we're fine with that. It's perfectly normal for someone who has had a heart attack to lose memory of the day before the heart attack and the medication made sure he was still half asleep yesterday, so it's normal that he doesn't remember that as well.  

Initially we considered bringing him his e-reader and tablet pc, but we decided that doing so would be way too risky, as expensive items are more prone to stealing. Yes, even in hospitals. He has tv now, so that's okay. We also brought him the book we bought him for his birthday. That will make sure he doesn't get too bored during his stay.

Not a lot will happen from now; now we're just waiting for dad to get back to strength so he can return home. This will still be a couple of days from now (apparently people who suffered a heart attack must be kept at the hospital for a minimum of ten days). I don't feel the need to update daily from now. I'd like to thank everyone again for the support and kind words and I'll let you know when dad gets home.

**Update 13-6**  
Dad got home today. He is relieved that he finally gets to sleep in his own bed again. He'll be under light supervision for a while and has to pay a monthly visit to a cardiologist. He also has to take a bucketload of pills every day. He doesn't mind all of that, though; he realises it's all for the better. He also realised he got a second chance and will try to have some more fun in life.",,False,,t5_2ranw,1371143056.0,,,True,t3_1fqdwg,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fqdwg/today_i_experienced_the_biggest_shock_in_my/,

I just wish I had any clue at all what I do wrong. I try to be clingy, I know people have lives and all. I am really laid back externally, wife and I are not at all snobs, we have a lot of interests, can hold an intelligent conversation. I just want to scream.

Someone, please tell me what the fuck is wrong with me, why doesn't anyone like me?!

He's a part of the baby boom generation. His dad, my grandpa, fought in WWII. My dad is a baby boomer. That baby boom generation has one huge issue: They got the idea of working hard to give their kids a better life. 

Here's where that's an issue. My dad worked to give me and my brothers an sister a good childhood. But now **all he does is complain that we have it too easy.** Wow, are you fucking kidding me. What do you want me to do? Get good grades? Done. I'm getting a 4.0 right now as I wind down my Junior Year in high school. 

Lately, my dad has been ranting and raving about how hard he works every day and how easy we have it and you should get a job and I pay for your private school education. Guess what? I never said I wanted a private school education. I wouldn't have cared if you sent me to public school for my Senior year, either. I don't even believe in god and they waste an entire year with bullshit religion classes when all I really want to do is learn worthwhile information. 

Get a job? That's a good idea. Why don't I get a job at this pizza place close by our house. Done. But wait, they're paying you in cash and that's shady, so I want you to to look for a new job.

 ""My friend said that he can probably hook me up with a job at a dog daycare place. How's that for you?"" 

""No! What if a dog bites you and you have to go to the hospital and get stitches?""

 Wow, what kind of job do you want me to get then? 

Then he goes off on a rant telling me that I have to get my own car because he's tired of paying for me to use his car and his gas and his insurance (I'm not sure 16 year olds can get insurance by themselves, but ok.). Wow dad, I bet it sucks. You're probably the only person in the world who has to feed, clothe, and educate your children, aren't you? That's surely not the job of a parent! Oh wait, that's exactly what your supposed to fucking do until I can take care of myself when I finish my education. 

He acts like this **all the time**. He will tell me to clean out the office room but then yell at me because I threw away something important. Here's a dandy idea, dad: You clean out the office, because it's **all your stuff**, and **I don't know what important shit you have in there!** 

""All you kids do is sit around the house and play on your computers! You guys need to get jobs.""

""I have a job, Dad."" 

""You work 3 hours a day on Thursday, Friday, an Saturday. That's not a real job. When I was 13 I bagged groceries every day after school! When I was 16 I was working full-time and going to school!"" 

That's interesting, Dad. Except for one little thing: We live in a **completely different era** with computers and age restrictions on jobs! Things aren't like they were when you were a kid, Dad. I can't walk down to the store and get gum for 5Â¢ or buy a used car (that works) for $1,000! [That's another thing: I have a few thousand dollars saved up from previous Birthdays and Christmases, so I never actually ask my dad for money. Ever.]

You can't tell me that I should do anything you ask me to do because you put a roof over my head and food on the table. **You signed up for that when you had kids!**  You can't tell me that you worked in a grocery store when you were 13! That's not something that kids can do these days.

 
I'm 16. I get good grades. I have a job. I worship your god every Sunday in Church because I'm not going to tell you that I'm atheist. I've been cleaning the shit that's in our basement whenever I have free time because if I didn't, our house would be featured on hoarders. You work. You complain about doing tasks that **parents are supposed to do**. You lounge around on Sunday and use the excuse that it's the Lord's day and that you should rest, but then on Monday you complain that you have too much work to do; all of which could have been done on Sunday.

I'm going to end this rant with a story.

My dad and mom always complain that we can't afford things like the gas bills and car insurance and taxes. Guess what we're doing in a couple of weeks? We're going on a **fucking cruise ship in the Caribbean.** Dad, Mom, and the four kids. How. Fucking. Expensive. So don't complain to me about paying for my private high school tuition, an then take the family on a cruise. 

Dad, calm the fuck down.

How did I fall in love with you in such a short period of time. I was first infatuated with you for the first month or so. But after a while, after all those long Skype and viber calls until 5-6 am...things started to change. We started to get more comfortable with one another. December came along, and everyone was on serious mode for exams. Nothing changed for us.. We just kept talking six out of seven nights until we fell asleep. When Christmas came along, we got into the habit of falling asleep over the calls. When we woke up, we would wake up to each others voice. I could never put a price  tag on how I felt falling asleep and waking up to your voice.  It was the best feeling in the world. I never realized how beautiful you truly were until Early-mid December. Thank you so much for that. 
It's approaching late January, and I can say I have fallen for you. These feelings I developed for you are stuck with me, especially what had happened this Saturday. 
You are sleeping right now, I really hope you are well. You have lots of work to do and so do I. But hopefully tonight, like almost every night for the last couple months, we will make time for each other. Thank you for trying so hard to maintain our friendship.

I cannot stand hearing stories about men getting slapped with child support when they didn't want a kid in the first place. Yeah, I know... takes two to tango. But what about cases in which they thought it wouldn't be an issue? Like women lying about being on birth control? Just recently I read a thread on reddit about some girl getting pregnant after she stopped taking BC because she was gaining weight and didn't like that, but she neglected to inform her boyfriend and is now upset that he wants an abortion.

I see a lot of this type of issue even within my own extended family. Females purposely trying to get pregnant for the perks - they don't want to work or hold a job, they want their food and resources paid for, and heck... they may just want to try and keep their latest guy in their life. 

So here's my take on it. I'm all for the right for women to choose or not choose abortion. I, myself, will not be having kids. If accidents happen, so will abortion. However, if they choose not to abort, I feel as though certain things should be taken into consideration. I feel as though the couple should discuss this well before sleeping together. If one in no way wants to have a child and the other seems to agree, but later ends up pregnant and wanting to keep it - the man should not be held responsible for child support. They made the whole ""no children"" thing quite clear.


I understand that this would probably not work well in real life. People can lie and say ""I told her I didn't want kids"" or ""we agreed that we would keep any children"" etc. *sigh* But I still can't help but think something should be done about it.

Stop telling me about you're stupid boyfriend. I'm happy to listen and offer advice, but for every four hours I listen, it would be great if you could maybe listen to me talk about girls just for 5 minutes.  Amazingly I have a romantic life too? 

Stop the mood swings. When you're happy you're ecstatic. Good for you. I'm a little more stable, and so I can't mirror your energy. Just because I don't bounce and dance and pirouette and hug and kiss everyone I see doesn't mean I'm not in a good mood. When you're not in this super happy mood you're irritable as shit. We're adults. You don't get to be irritable all the time. It's not how real life works. Suck it up you fucking princess, and stop making me take all the heat.   

This is a big one.
Stop taking all the credit for my work. I know you have self-esteem problems, but there's a line that you're crossing when you do that. You know I can't say anything without sounding egotistical, and I want to trust you to do the right thing, but I'm very worried you won't. 

Sometimes I wish we weren't business partners. Frankly I need a break from you, and when you behave like this, I need some time to zen, calm myself, forgive and forget (because I know you won't change). It's not fair that when I'm pissed off at you I should be forced into seeing you for another 8 hours every day.

I've been so for most of my adult life, but particularly after my husband died five years ago.  As I write this, I haven't gone outside my house in a year, or met anyone in the flesh for close to four years.

And tomorrow that will change.  Tomorrow I'm set to have lunch with a local friend I met online.  And that's it, in all its terrifying ordinariness -- a simple lunch, nothing more -- something a million people do every day and never think twice about... but to me, right now, it's just about the most overwhelming thing in the world.

The last time I felt this level of terror and uncertainty was the day my husband died.  I had tried to kill myself after his funeral -- and then I moved back in with my family, locked every mental and emotional door to the outside world as tightly as I could... and traded in my failure after his funeral for a much slower form of suicide.

And now I'm about to open that door again.  And it's *me* doing it, there's nothing on the other side of that door that's kicking it down and dragging me out... it's only me opening it up from the inside... completely of my own will and my own necessity.

and it's not only that I *have* to do it -- but the better part of me, the scarred and shriveled voice of my survival, actually *wants* to do this.  Everything else in my brain is screaming *no* at it, screaming for it to stop, to find some excuse to spend one more day in the small soft womb of my room... and let one more day become one more week become one more year become one more lifetime.  The closer I've been getting to this date, this appointment of my own making, the tighter the fear is wrapping myself against my lungs... the past couple days there have been minutes going by where the fear's had such a strong hold on me that I literally forgot to breathe.

The fear keeps telling me so many things.  It keeps telling me it would be easier not to go.  It's telling me that I can heal while I hide.  It tells me that the more I keep the world shut out, the less there is anything that anyone could do or say to me to hurt me, or for me to hurt *them*.  It tells me that I'm safe in my isolation, and that every risk I never took and every opportunity I threw away and every bridge that I burned was its safeguard -- its *gift* to me.  It tells me that I've hurt enough, I've paid any debts of pain I had several times over, it tells me that I *deserve* ""freedom"" from the terror of possibilities.  It tells me over and over, in every gentle voice and every full-throated scream within its power, that there's not one single fucking thing I can try to do in the outside world that will ever be *easier* to stay in here.

And it's *right*.  That's the best weapon against myself that my fear has ever had.  It does its share of lying to myself, of scaring me into submission with its army of ghosts and myths -- but in these things it is absolutely right.  It may never be a *better* life here on this side of the door, but when was *better* ever promised to me or to anyone in the whole fucking world?

I *could* have easier, though.  I could have easier tomorrow, I could have easier for the rest of my life.  I could write one email and have *easy* back in my brain right this fucking moment.  The fear keeps telling me that it's the best and truest thing it has for me, that easiness, that terminal numb comfort, the surest and most absolute gift it has ever given me or ever could.

But I'm still going to go kick down that fucking door anyway.

Iâm not at the top of the online leaderboards, but Iâm the only 150 cc among my 50 cc friends, if you know what I mean.

As a good father and an encouraging mentor I need my four-year-old son to win sometimes.   His sister is a step ahead of him so far in most skills from sports and video games to eating efficiently and wiping and I need to remind him that heâs a BAMF without making her fake an inferior level of skill, something she shouldnât have to do yet.

So I do it.  I steer into the fences, or off the edges of the cliffs and let Lakitu pick me back up from my fall, only to find that he STILL HASNâT CAUGHT UPâ¦

And Iâm pretty good at making it look like Iâm doing my best.  Heâs getting better at wondering why Iâm doing so bad, so I have to work harder at tricking him into thinking Iâm trying.  Iâve adopted the same method he uses, which is simply holding the gas down and steeringâ¦..thatâs it.  Heâll throw items when he gets them, but other than that there is nothing but gas and steering wheel.  Iâve attempted this, thinking that it will keep me right behind him.  I still inadvertently choose slightly more geometrically beneficial paths than he does (apparently) and I find myself BEATING THE SHIT OUT OF HIM.  I donât mean to do it.  Heâs just that bad.

And I know heâs got the genes of an MK Badass in him, and I canât wait to see that come out but I donât want to wish away these sweet, childhood years; I want to make the most of them.  We gonna race.
How to teach him competitiveness AND honor?  How do I let him win but also teach him to strive for even more speed?  Heâs already exhibiting pompous attitude traits at times.  You should see his face when he hits me with a blue shell.  Itâs making me shake just thinking about it.

I love that little joker.  Heâs my mini me.  He inhabits a place in my heart that even my little six-year-old princess (who has her own spot) couldnât invade, despite her incumbent nature.  I never thought that would be possible.

But if I have to let him win one more time and see him shake his milk-white bottom in my face as he poorly imitates a victory dance heâs seen somewhere on tv or the internet, I might just snapâ¦.

I hope that getting this off my chest will cool my jets enough to help me deal with getting 2nd through 8th place for another year or so, at least  until heâs putting up a relatively fair fight on the track.  Then you better look out for the father-son team thatâs gonna sweep the leaderboardsâ¦
Thanks for listening, and keep on racingâ¦

HAPPY. This is exactly how I feel about my father's death. He passed away this April, after been in coma for 8 months (heart attacks caused lack of Oxygen in his brain). I've felt bad, about not feeling devastated over his death. Do I make sense when I say this? 
It just didn't seem like a way he would have chosen to live, there were so many times I regretted asking the doctor to resuscitate him; because I know he would have never chose to live like that.

While in coma, every time I imagined him dying I pictured myself depressed, not eating, rarely smiling, but none of that happened. My life continued and I'm happy about his death because it was the only way he was released from all the pain he endured (he developed bed sores all over his body from being in bed). He no longer had to be in a nursing home where the fucking useless and heartless nurses wouldn't do shit for him,  nor have a poop bag on his stomach, a feeding tube, or a trachea tube.

Let's start from the beginning. When I was younger, my dad was always... weird. My mom and Dad divorced when I was 2, and though I know I did, I don't really remember spending much time with him before I was about... 6? I remember he never did anything that straight up crossed the line, but he was always inappropriate. At 6, 7, he would let me watch the big sex scenes in movies, and even laugh at me when I would get embarrassed and hide my face or walk away. He would always go into his room to jack off to porn even though I would be leaving the next day and couldn't he just wait 12 hours? Even at that age I knew what he was doing. At night, I would sleep in his bed because I was afraid of windows at night, and his living room is all windows basically on two walls. He would make me let him cuddle up with me, and get mad when I wouldn't. He would always talk about my mom, and the things she used to do and how pretty she was, etc. He would only sleep in underwear. I felt very awkward the entire time. I did not want to cuddle. The few times I expressed that, he made me feel bad until I did. 

Then there was the picture. I didn't even remember anything about this picture until I was 14 and he showed it to me in a multipe-picture picture frame he kept in his closet. There I was, roughly 6-7, naked, sitting in a big arm chair. You couldn't see anything in the picture due to a guitar on my lap, and a bunch of stuffed animals around me. But you could tell that I wasn't wearing clothes. I remember the guitar being cold, and wanting to put my clothes on. I don't, however, know if these are true memories, or memories that have been conjured up from seeing the picture.


When I found this picture, I was already an angst-ridden teenager. I was self-harming and occasionally forcing myself to throw up. Eventually I told my mom about everything. She was amazing. She told me she would do whatever I wanted and that she was here for me all the way. I told her I didn't want to do anything about it, I just wanted somebody to know. I wanted her to understand why I never wanted to go over there. She supported me, put me into therapy, and told me that she would cut off all ties with my father if I wished. I didn't want that either, as my two siblings frequently made the two of them speak and see each other. I got better, my mom and I's relationship grew significantly, and for I only spoke to my father when I absolutely had to.


Fast forward to now. I'm nineteen, in college, and working a summer job at my dad's workplace. It isn't ideal, but it's easy work and it pays better than any of my previous jobs. I just got the call 45 minutes ago that my niece had made molestation allegations against my dad, and that's why he wasn't at work Friday. I thought it was odd that he had texted me ""I'll love you more than you'll ever know"" on Friday, and I asked him if everything was okay. He said yes. He texted me again later saying ""I love you"" and I told him I loved him too.

I don't know what to think. It's all very complicated. The niece, who we'll call A, is my brother's child. He had dated her mother since middle school, high school, and got married. A few years out of high school and they've both gotten into doing pills a lot. The wife, who we'll call T, cheated on my brother with his best friend at the time. My brother was distraught. Got even worse into pills and other drugs. Started running with an even worse crowd, and eventually got arrested for multiple charges of burglary. I know that at some point he went on a drug run to Florida with a bunch of his friends to take care of some guy who owed them money. I have no idea what happened. He divorced T, and went into jail for two years. He starts a rehab program, and starts doing a lot better for himself. He now lives in a halfway house, and has been clean since jail. I am incredibly proud of him. T, on the other hand, has only gotten worse. Jail time after jail time, seizures from all of the pills, etc. She went off and had a kid with the guy she cheated on my brother with. Then she gets caught stealing from some tobacco store. Goes into jail. After wanting nothing to do with my brother the entire time he's been going through all of this, she starts writing him letter after letter after letter, professing her love to him in one sentence and telling her how much she hates him in the next. Five to six pages, front and back, every one of them. They all say the same thing over and over and over. Honestly, when I read them, I started to wonder about her mental state. And not in a ""Hahah!"" way, but a genuine worry for her. She finally stopped sending them, telling my brother she hates him because he never replies, he let my dad see the letters, etc.

Three days ago, she gets out of jail. And now these allegations have come up.


I honestly have no idea what to think, what to do, or what to believe. Yes, my father did some bad things but he never crossed that line. That also doesn't mean that he wouldn't with someone else, though. He saw A every week. She spent the night with him all the time, and she even has her own room at his house.
Would T just make these allegations come up? I don't know. She has known our family for so long, she wouldn't would she? But she is also ridiculously addicted to pills and is not in a good mental state.

I am so fucking lost right now.




TLDR; My dad has always been a bit inappropriate and a bit out of line. After a lot of anger and addiction, my brother's ex-wife finally got out of jail.

You never clean anything or take the garbage out. You leave your dishes in the sink for more then a month and it stinks. You leave food on the counters and use my kitchen wares and damage them and the place is full of mice now because of how filthy you are. You steal my mugs and kitchen supplies and hoard them in your rooms.
You have never once held a conversation with me or even been remotely friendly. If you had ever asked I would let you watch what you want on TV or chill in the living room.

I could understand if you had EVER EVEN ONCE asked to watch TV or come in the living room and I had been a bitch and refuse or barred you entry. But the fact is I am not that sort of person and the living room is free for all in the house. You have never once expressed interest in anything except being in your room with the door shut.
So do NOT inform me when I walk in the door that you are making a schedule for who can use the living room and that I am expected to follow it. It's my house too and I will not be confined to my room. I will sit on the couch whenever I damn well please. IF a schedule for ANYTHING in the house is ever to be put into place I expect all residents of the house to have a say in it. You cannot make a schedule based on you alone and try to shove it in my face.
Simply put, you can try to enforce a schedule, but I will in no circumstances follow it. And if you try to kick me out of the common area meant for everyone in the house I will laugh in your face and would love to see you try anything.

I can't leave you because I can't support myself and our children.  I have asked you so many times to just talk to me, hold me, anything.  And you won't.

That's pretty fantastic but not the main focus of this ""offmychestation""

What happened while I was talking to the girl is the important part. A chat window opened and it was some random dude. Now, I'd never really used the feature and I saw that I had a good match with this guy for the friends match. While not exactly on the look for friends, I figured maybe this guy needed someone to talk to and I figured ""why not, I'm not doing anything anyways"" 

So, I talk to him for a bit and it becomes quite apparent that friendship is not what he is seeking. Apart from a cursory intro, I start receiving compliments.

Now, let me tell you something, I've never gotten compliments in my life really apart from my parents and girls that want things from me. They're usually along the lines of ""your'e so cool, wanna help me move my bf out of his place"" or ""you're really interesting, wanna buy me a drink"" and my all time favourite ""I'll make out with you for a cigarette"" (which I accepted). So needless to say, as soon as I hear someone complimenting me, my defense mechanism usually comes up faster than a light bulb turns on. 

Mixing the whole no compliments thing with an almost non-existent sex life brought me to a few dark places in my life. I dunno, I never exactly saw myself as being ""desirable"" or even a sexual being. I'm just a guy that goes to school, plays video games and drinks with friends. I have no problem talking to girls, but they're just not interested in me. I'd pretty much resigned myself to being a life long bachelor because that's what my experiences thought me.

So, along comes that dude. I've never met him before, I'll never meet him, and there he is, complimenting me and what not. I've gotten more compliments in the 30 minute window than I had gotten up to that point in my life. I'd been doing a lot of self-improvement such as losing 30 pounds, dressing better, rebuilding my confidence and here was a guy that was complimenting me on all those facets of myself when all those around me hadn't noticed or hadn't cared and when I needed their support more than anything else. Some stranger was doing their job. 

Sadly, I couldn't reciprocate the attraction, but I did thank him and told him that that was the first time in my life I'd ever gotten compliments out of the blue. He said he was surprised a ""Cute"" guy like me didn't get more, and that's what did it. No one had ever even said I was good looking, or cute, or even ugly, or anything, I just felt so removed from sexuality as a whole, and now BAM. Fucking awakening. 

I'd just like to say to that random guy, thanks a lot man, you pretty much made all the efforts I've done up to this point be worth a damn and I'm gonna keep working my ass off. I also had a great day from the compliments and my confidence level haven't been this great in a long long time. Thanks dude

Relationships have always been tough regarding these issues because guys tend to get sick of me or don't know what to do with me and just blame me for some things which I cannot control. Some issues I can and I'm going to get a little more of a handle on them so I can be in control as much as possible.

Through so much that I've already gone through, in the nine months we've been together, he has made me feel loved and that he loves me for who I am, regardless of what health issues I'm going through. I never thought I would find real love but this proves to me that I was incorrect in that thinking. I found someone wonderful and I hope that I can be the same understanding person to him, that he is to me.

But Asians, oh noooo, it's appropriate to make fun of those. Slanty eyes, amazing at video games, math, nerdy, weak, etc. call them all of that. Who cares? It's funny! They aren't offended, it's just a joke, lighten up, ""we don't really mean it"". 3 Chinese people die in a horrific flight accident, and some assholes have the balls to play an incredibly racist prank on a news station. And how does reddit react? With more jokes, mocking the situation, completely disrespectful of the humans who died in the tragedy. What if the flight was an arabic flight? And they made fun of arab names? It would be a shocking display of ignorance. If they made fun of black names, it would be a complete insult to blacks in the US. But it's never this way for Asians. God forbid, if someone was making these jokes after the Boston Bombings, the hivemind would be against them, downvoting them to oblivion on every subreddit besides i'mgoingtohellforthis. But no, these are asian victims, foreign and strange, with their funny sounding names and weird customs. It's just a joke!

The worst part of all this is that, when the Asian American community tries to speak up about this, nearly every single time they are answered with the same kind of response: it's just a joke, lighten up. Cloud Atlas, Jeremy Lin ""chink"" and jokes, Charlie Chan - it's become so internalized in our culture that people can't see it anymore. But it's there. 

I'm not ""from china"". I don't speak ""ching chong"". I don't eat dogs. I'm not good at math. And why the HELL would you think it would be appropriate to ask that in the first place? Go ask a black person if he ""grew up on the streets"", if he deals drugs, if he likes fried chicken. I dare you. You won't do it, will you? Because it's racist and untrue? Yeah, that's what I think, too.

Either have the maturity to be able to make fun of every culture without offense, or don't make fun of any of them. The jokes aren't insensitive, the double standard is.

You get upset about it, but I did have relationships with them long before you came into the picture. 

I stood by you when you declared your independence from your family, I supported every little thousand dollar hobby that you blew off after six months, I bailed you out when you got caught stealing from your work, I even forgave you when you lost yourself and had an affair. Selling everything we owned and uprooting us to the other side of the planet wasn't my idea, neither was coming home after 3 months to start from scratch all over again with our son smack dab in the middle. 

Ever wonder why I'm never home? Always tired? You try supporting a family of three on $15/hr. Let's see how exhausted you are after the first week. I've been doing it since you got fired in July for stealing. 

I gave up Paramedic school so you could pursue a fucking art degree. A decent living helping people, that's all I wanted. You want me to support you through a one in ten thousand chance that you'll go somewhere with that 4 year piece of paper that's taking you 8 years to earn.  I'm done with this though.

If someone has a fucking problem, and you respond by downplaying it, pointing out how it could be worse, or telling them they shouldn't have a problem because someone has a larger one, you're the scum of the fucking earth.

I am personally slightly depressed, some days I feel not that great, and some days I feel borderline suicidal. I don't tell a fucking soul, why? Because all in all, my life is pretty good, and I know if I tell someone, their first response will be ""why, you don't have cancer/ your best friend hasn't killed them self/ some other event someone went through"".

I am so fucking sick of feeling guilt for being sad or for having a problem. Yeah, someone has a bigger problem, sucks for them, but I'm allowed to be fucking sad for my own personal issues without some petty, arrogant asshole making feel guilty for it too.

Sorry you'll only get to spend 13.5 hours playing instead of the full 14 you seem to be accustomed to because I requested that you make a couple of phone calls that I won't be able to make while the place is still open.

You keep weird hours, just so you can sleep at times when I won't be in bed.

Seriously people, the kid is 19 months old!  He's getting sick of nursing and so am I! No, I am NOT going to withhold food to force him back on the boob. That WOULD be abusive!

She went off on me about how I'm a terrible mother for favoring my unborn child over my current son, how dare I not continue to force him to nurse, blah blah blah.

Please know that I really love you more than anything. I know you spend the hours we are apart on this site, that chances of you finding this, and reading it, are pretty high even if this isn't one of your favorite subs.

I need you to know the extent of the screaming, of the pain, and how fragile I really am. I really need you to see me for what I really am: a broken, bleeding mess of a human being. For so long I was alone. It was terrible, but I was numb. The beatings didn't matter, the drunken molestation, being thrown from my home several times by the monster when I was just a kid, like elementary age, didn't matter. I was inside myself. Nothing could get through my wall. 

Everyone around me started dying. You were there to help lead me back from the nightmares where all I saw was him. Where he tortured me again and again. I lost my nerve. I was a wreck. But you were beside me. Regardless of your religious upbringing you started sleeping in my bed to keep me there. It drove your mother insane. She made me read the bible. So we ran away and you saved my life over and over....

But that's not what I'm here to talk about. 

I see him. I hear her. He's bloated and his veins are destroyed from the heroin. Her arms are still bleeding from the gouges she made with that knife. Why did I have to see that? Why did I have to go there? Why didn't I run away?

She was lying there on the bed, both arms torn apart by his rusted old pocket knife he used to carry. She was staring right into my eyes. She knew it was my fault. I haven't had a real moment of peace.

I really came here to explain. You need to know what still haunts me. You won't listen at home. You get frustrated with me because you see strength that I won't use, resilience that has gotten me this far. You see it, you say you do, but I promise its not there.

I can't gather my thoughts anymore. I make simple mistakes because I can't remember or focus. There is just so much noise. First the whispering starts. Usually just before I'm fully awake. Then there is screaming and I'm terrified and all I want is for you to be here with me. Then there is me. The doubts, the small things I notice that dig inside of me and burst through into my heart until its torn up and useless. And then I realize I'm not safe. And I have to have you. You have to bring me back away from the nightmare. The monster stands two feet away yelling at me in my quiet little office and I have to ignore it, while she whispers in my ear.

""I can't hear you sir, ease speak up and toward the hole in the window...""

""... Its your fault. You're s disappointment and evil. You deserve how they treat you. You aren't a real person you're a monster.""

""Sir, please speak louder.""

Is my entire day. Because she won't shut up whispering, he won't stop screaming, and I know I'm going crazy so I don't give two fucks what the man at the window wants or who he is, I can't help him anyway.

""I need the work order for mumbling jackass, he's here..."" I want to call out.

Now you know, for certain who I am and that this was meant for you. To help you understand why one day soon.... I may not come home. Because its not just worse when I am stressed out, its all the time, there is no peace. I think I'm supposed to go with them. I think they'll haunt me until I join them... Because its my fault they died. He couldn't take my pain, I shouldn't have taken it out on him... And she was innocent... She was just caught in the crossfire. She reminds me every day. I was over it, I know I can't control people, that their choices are their own to make regardless of my influence I never put that needle in his arm.

But why couldn't my mom just be on my side? Maybe she could help me. Maybe. They see me as weak. You saw. ""I worked harder and longer and had lore responsibility than you at a younger age than you are now!"" ""I work hard every day of my life!"" it doesn't matter that they don't work every single day of the week like I do for a minimum of 12 hours a day. It doesn't matter that I never have a day off, or that the job I hate wears me down so bad I fall asleep driving home. It doesn't matter that I get told that I am worth less than everyone there, I think because of our love, or that I get teased for being a man because I'm with you and I don't dress like a slut. It doesn't matter that randomly, out of the blue they will tell me that I my love doesn't matter. That I can't be engaged to you because our state won't allow it to go any further. I sit in shock and I want to cry because no one, ever, has loved someone as much as I love you. I try to vent, to feel better about it by getting that poison out of me.... But they tell me to suck it up. So I don't mention it. I don't talk. I sit on that office doing my work in silence. I'm going crazy.

All the while the screaming and the whispering and my own insecure mind ramblings get in the way of how I think and function.

""Where is she going why doesn't she ever tell me- please shut up it doesn't matter- I bet she's mad at me oh no she's going to tell our boss to fire me- so what, she's awful and you hate this job anyway- why doesn't she take the tube why do I always have to take the tube and do all the work- so don't take it. You care significantly less than she does if the paperwork gets done or not- but why does she always have to be such a monster can't she just be friendly- why can't you just stop it?""

Why can't I just be confident again.

So you know why. You know now that I'm falling and falling and I can't catch my breath. But, at the same time if you're here I can breathe and I'm safe from the sting of raw skin in harsh wind.

Most of this was written when I was okay, coherent enough to understand I had to stop when I started rambling, then regain my train of thought and start again... I'm sorry it its more confusing than I think of is... I just need you. I need your help. I need help. I need help please I need help. How to I tell them?

Why am I such a chicken? They want me to go with them.

Update: I got home from work today alright. She came and picked me up, sitting in the parking lot for a while because I never know when my shifts will end. We didn't really talk, she did find me here so she knew the state I was in. Most times just being close helps get me away from the nightmares.

Right now I'm watching the rain pour as my cats fight over the best window spot and updating! For those of you who reached out, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I had a rough childhood, my dad hated me so much he tried to kill me and the rest of my family has always been indifferent to me, treating me like a pest they can't be bothered with. In college I witnessed a horrific suicide that haunts me. I am currently on xanax, though I rarely take it. I prefer to find my center, but some times it builds up so so much that I can't. The support from all of you got me through today safely. And I can never, ever tell you all how much you saved me.

For those who stood up for me against a certain strong minded... Butt head for lack of a better word... I thank you as well.

1363136167.0,149,self.offmychest,1a6omq,No one wants a diabetic cat.,Candid_Callie,170,21,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1a6omq/no_one_wants_a_diabetic_cat/,"[UPDATED July 29th 2013 sad](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jatlw/update_no_one_wants_a_diabetic_cat_sad/)

You were found behind a restaurant beachside with the alleycats.  You were different.  You were so skinny.  Someone had your front paws declawed.  You were a friendly, dapper, loving, vocal, tuxedo boy and she took you home hoping to find your owners because there is no way anyone would have just thrown you out...


The reality was you weren't microchipped.  No one had 'lost you.  You wouldn't stop eating or drinking or peeing.  She realized something was wrong and brought you to the national chain vet clinic where my (former) best friend used to work.  I'm not sure who named you Phillip, but it was either the lady who found you or my best friend.  You didn't answer to it.  That's for damn sure.  Who names a beta cat Phillip anyway?  It doesn't matter.  It is irrelevant.  You are Mr. Kitty to me!  A proper name for a cat in a suit.


Anyway, after a few hundred dollars in tests, the clinic said you had diabetes.  The lady didn't have a few hundred dollars more to put you down so she put you on craigslist to try and find you an angel.  It was close to Christmas a little more than three years ago.  If any cat deserved a Christmas miracle, it was the sweetest cat in the world: you.


My (former) best friend, the same one from the clinic, contacted the lady on craigslist.  She saved your life.  She imagined that everyone would love you.  That she wouldn't have a problem finding you a forever home.  She ignored the Vet who told her to not get involved.  She even told me a few times she wouldn't have a problem finding you a home.  She could see you were a good cat, a sweet cat, a loving cat.  But nobody wants a diabetic cat.


Her life fell apart.  Drugs and bad relationships.  Against my advice, my fiance let her move into our spare bedroom for a few weeks.  She overstayed her welcome.  The brown widow spiders she brought with her are still around our yard.  It has been almost three years since hers fell apart and you are still in my garage where she left you.


I've gotten over my fear of needles.  But I've had no choice.  I've given you shots 2-3 times a day since she left you here.  You get the cheap wet food just as often.  I told her I couldn't afford to keep you.  But every month I spend another $50 for food, litter, insulin, syringes.  $50 is a lot of money when you have next to nothing.  And I would be lying if I said I didn't resent you and her (to a much much greater extent) because of this.


Living in the garage is not ideal.  I fucking know that.  You're a good boy.  You never complained.  You would sing when it was dinner time.  You would yowl to greet me when I was getting my grumpy coffee in the morning.  When I was petting you and you wanted more time, you would catch my leg as I walked away and you would give me moon eyes until I gave you a little more time.  I've tried, and begged, and bartered and given more than I could to give you more time...


I tried to find you a home.  Craigslist doesn't want a diabetic cat.  The bitch at the humane society flat out refused in the worst, way possible.  She was a fucking monster and does not deserve to work with animals even in a volunteer position.


I spoke with so many people from so many different no-kill shelters and non-profits.  ""I'm sorry.  We can't take a special needs cat.  The economy is so bad we can't even adopt out the kittens we have.""  But the real salt in the wound was the day that three people from one of the no kill shelters (yeah, the one that didn't have any room for you a week earlier) asked permission to check my back yard for this feral mama kitty who had moved her SIX kittens.  They apparently had the money and space to house, feed, spay/neuter, give shots to AND adopt out SEVEN fucking cats.  But they didn't have enough room in their hearts to give you a better chance than I could.  Fucking hypocrites had enough money and resources to take care of SEVEN feral cats.  But the sweetest diabetic cat in the world was sneered at.  Yes, sweetie, they sneered down their noses when I asked.  I still feel sick thinking about it.  It makes me so angry.


A year ago, you almost died.   I had to change your insulin from lantus to humilin and you got sick at the same time.  You were probably sick before, but you hid it and I'd been sick on and off for weeks so I was exhausted and I hadn't noticed.  I just remember you hadn't been crying for your food.   Then, i couldn't find you in the morning.  When I finally found your limp body in the cubby an hour after breakfast time, you were hot.  You were almost unconscious and you were not lucid.  Your blood sugar was above 600!!!  I gave you water 1mL at a time through a dropper.  I made a slurry out of fancy feast and gave it to you mL by mL.   I have stacks of paper.  Notes from the 6 weeks of my life I devoted to yours mL by mL, one test strip, one lancet, one unit at a time.  Bits of a life, drops of devotion, more time than I had, I gave to you.


While you were sick, my doctor had prescribed me amoxicillin for a 'sinus infection'.   The bottle said I needed to take it all, but fuck that.  I looked at a bunch of stuff online and realized that your symptoms weren't from the the insulin change it just was a coincidence that you fell deathly ill that same day.  You had an infection somewhere and I couldn't afford a vet.  Amoxicillin was okay for kitties and we had absolutely nothing to lose because I'd kept you alive with my love and my time for over a month.


I estimated your weight.  I did some math.  I crushed up half a pill into a fine powder.  I added an exact amount of water.  I'd shake it up and give you a syringe full by mouth twice a day.  One day, you fought me off when you saw the syringe filled with the nasty, chalky, white concoction.  It was the only time you ever hurt me.  You scratched me with your hind claws as you tried to get traction to escape the antibiotics.  You were like a scrambling jackrabbit and I wasn't mad.  I cried tears of joy because it meant my dapper happy tuxedo boy was better.  And you were!  You cried for food, and caught my leg, and gave me moon eyes again.  And in the blink of an eye, another year passed.


I got sick.  I caught croup from the babies I watch two weeks ago.  You are so patient with them even though they scare you with their screeches of delight.  Even when they are rough, and pull your tail, and make you uncomfortable you are so good to them.  You purr and meow and give me this *WTF make it stop* look.  But you never bite, you never bat at them, you just let them experience the joy and warmth and love of their first kitty and for that, I am grateful.  But it makes everything so much more difficult.


You, my sweet boy, are a victim of circumstance.  Life dealt you one bad hand after another and instead of being bitter, you have loved those who helped and fed you.  You even loved me unconditionally when I was terrible person and ignored your want of love and affection because I was bitter with life.  If things were different, if you hadn't just been left in the garage with a house full of asthmatics who are extremely allergic to cats, if we had wanted you as much as you wanted us to, if we had the money for our medical care and yours...


But things aren't different.  We've tried and tried and tried to find you a home and no one wanted you.  No one wanted a diabetic cat.  No one even wanted to give you a chance.  If you were *only* a cat, they could see you for how special you are.  Instead, time and time again, tears clouded my vision because diabetes clouded theirs.


It looks like your last home will be the garage.  You're sick again.  You waited until I had caught croup and couldn't breathe.  I was too feverish to notice until earlier today.  It looks like you've thrown up almost everything you've eaten for the last two days.  You started losing weight a couple weeks ago.  It wasn't your insulin.  I don't know what is going on, but I know you are miserable now and my heart is aching.  


I don't have the money for a vet.  I don't have the time to be your angel again.  I have two amoxicillin left, but the store didn't have any oral syringes and everyone was glaring at me for being all red-faced and crying and snotting all over myself.  I just can't do this again.  Honestly, I can't and I'm sorry because I'm going to let you down Mr. Kitty.  Last time you got sick, you lived for me.  Right now, you are in the garage.  He won't let me bring you in the house and keep you in the bathroom until your appointment on Thursday.  Maybe tomorrow night he will, but for now, i can't and I'm sorry but it isn't fucking fair.


I'm letting you down Mr. Kitty.  I'll give you water with the insulin syringe I busted the tip off of.  I'll try to find some way to give you food.  I'll hold you and pet you and try to keep you comfortable as much as I can.  But on Thursday, at noon, I'm letting you down.  We're going to your appointment to be put to sleep.  All because I failed at finding someone who wanted the sweetest, best cat in the world.  But the truth is, no one in this world wants a diabetic cat...and the one person who really wants you can't afford to keep you anymore.

For a time their wasn't a day that would go by that I wouldn't think about it and feel guilty, now I have sadly become apathetic about it, it has been 5 years since the last time i did it ( possibly have become apathatic to it because I might have depression because I match allot of the symptoms and it runs in the family what I did to my sister may be the reason for it or probably contributed to it in some way, BUT that isn't important what is wrong with me dosen't matter I DESERVE IT. )

I honestly don't know how it started or why I did it no matter how it started I am worthless for doing it, but I think it started because for a few years prior for some reason I started having sexual thoughts about her, and then I guess I just started doing it. I don't know why she didn't tell anybody, or hasn't yet, ( she is 17 now its been 5 years ), part of me thinks she dosen't remember but then I think how couldn't she, or maybe she dosen't want me to get kicked out and hated by our family ( I am currently living with my sister and my mom and dad as I have no where else to go, and no means of my own to go anywhere else yet I work minimum wage so not enough money to move out on, and am currently helping pay for things because I am the only between us who has a job, my dad has disability but his disabilty isn't enought to pay for all the bills by itself). One point she told me in front of my parents ( she had already told them )that she was seeing counseling partially for being molested by a friend I used to have, which makes me think either she does remember that I did it and she lied about who did it to Protect me ( I don't know why she would do that ) or even worse that someone else molested her.

I just needed to say this to someone, recently I have been thinking about confronting her about this and Apologizing ( nothing I can say or do will forgive what I have done, but I think I need to say I am sorry and show I truly regret what I did and ontop of that it may help her ) the only thing stopping me from apologizing is many things, 

1. she may not remember and saying it will spark the memories causing her to cry and tell mom and dad with best case scenario they kick me out and disown me with me having no place to go ( I deserve it but honestly don't want it ).

2. She does remember and saying it causes her to admit to me she hates me, but dosen't tell mom and dad and may eventually end like scenario 1 or at the very minimum we never talk again.

3. Same as Scenario 1 except my dad literally murders me.

4. This is the best case scenario in my mind but unrealistic, she admits that she knows and has always remember I tell how wrong I was and how much I hate myself and we work on our relationship to where it will maybe turn back to normal after telling her and mom and dad never find out.

THANK YOU for listening I know I am the biggest most Worthless brother and Asshole in existence but I have never told anyone that before and I needed to, also on the subject of me apologizing should I do it as soon as possible even though I am living with my parents or should I wait until she Graduates and I move out, or at the very minimum until either she Graduates and moves out or I move out.

SORRY FOR THE LENGTH

**Update:** I APOLOGIZED today, I took her for a walk and told how sorry I was and how much I hate myself for what I did and honestly I didn't like her reaction. When I told her I basically just started by apologizing and then told her what I was apologizing for to make sure she understood. After wards she said she had gotten at least mostly over it but at the same time kind of played it off like it wasn't to big of a deal, saying ""it's fine"" or ""I'm over it and have delt with it"", ( She may be telling the truth because she may have delt with this in therapy but I just can't believe shes fully moved on from it ), when she went to therapy she was able to talk with her therapist about it and he helped her through it. I don't believe that she has completely delt with it, but the more fucked up thing is that the friend that she said molested her, REALLY DID not to long BEFORE i did, Great fucking great, not only does her worthless brother do something so fucked up to her his friend does it first just a year before I did. In all Honesty I hope Apologizing helped her in some way and I hope that it is able to help her move and on be able to be happy.

She's got Anxiety. She's got it bad. Through breathing techniques we've learned how to conquer attacks, and have made some discoveries together about her attacks. We've grown, stronger together. She maybe a short girl, but she's a fighter. She's a country girl who loves the fourth of July.

She is insecure about her body. I would have never known if she hadn't told me. I thought I knew everything about her. When she told me, it devastated me. I wanted to yell that she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. 

She's my journalist. My sparring partner. My lover. My equal. My opposite. My opponent. My best friend. My colleague.

We've fought. Little arguments here and there. She has been incredibly stressed; I've been annoyed. I forget she has anxiety and depression. I yell at her. Never on purpose. Never with hate, or anger. Only with little patience. I feel terrible afterwards. She thinks I don't notice. 

She wanted to talk. She said so after an arguement; said we would talk after work. I didn't want her to say ""Maybe we should take a break"". I couldn't bear that. So I was nice. I took her mind off it. I thought maybe she would put it off. She has. I'm thankful, because without her love, I don't know what I would do.

Most are pretty moderate but one has been thrown into a frenzy since the Martin - Zimmerman ruling about prevailing racism in the US. 

While I agree that racism, sexism, hate against LGBT all exist, I struggle to think that it is only outside influences or people causing people to be in the position they are. 

I say this because some of my friends friends go to all black colleges or are part of black only interest groups and fraternities. But why? Why do you fight so hard for integration when you end up segmenting yourself out of your own will by race? 

Or why is it that over 90% of murders are Blacks killing other Blacks but Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, killing someone causes national furor and outrage in Black communities? Where is the outrage when the everyday things like this happen? Shouldn't it be actually worse in the former scenario than the latter? 

And when issues of education or opportunity are brought up, it's history to blame. They were too stigmatized and are too stigmatized to do anything about it. But why? Asians and Hispanics came to the US and managed to persevere. 

I guess my main issue is that I recognize racism is still around but I believe it is not as big of an issue as it used to be. I almost feel like by focusing so much on racism and constantly bringing it up, they remind us that race still exists; that race actually still even matters at all. I sometimes can't help but think that Blacks use ""race"" and the checkered past its had for them as an excuse or trump card to absolve them of all personal fault or blame in things.

You're twenty-eight. You were my English teacher for two years. You were probably the first male that I've ever really had a positive experience with. You were the first man I ever actually trusted and respected. You knew this. 

Two years ago when I was fifteen and in your English class, you kept me back and asked me about the scars and bruises. You understood. You were the first person to tell me that I didn't have to put up with my brother's abuse just because he was sick. You made me promise you to get help, and I did. You are the reason why I moved in with my cousins and felt safe for the first time in my life. 

You were probably the only kind of friend I had in high school. I would go to your classes during lunch time and we'd talk about books we'd read recently. We went and grabbed coffee before school everyday and you told me about how your mother was dying of Alzheimer's and I held your hand. That time when someone spiked my drink at a party you came and picked me up and let me sleep on your shoulder. I used to go to your fucking house and we'd listen to your record collection and watch old movies. Everything just seems so wrong now. You're twenty eight. You were my teacher.

You told our class you weren't going to be our teacher anymore because you plan on going back to uni. Then you told me to stay behind and you fucking told me that you loved me and not just in a platonic way which I would have been fine with but in a romantic way and then you said you wanted to kiss me so badly and then you did kiss me and now everything is fucked up and you're the shittiest teacher ever because I'm still writing ridiculously long run-on sentences and I hate hate hate that I feel so fucking sick and I just wished you hadn't done that because I don't want to know about how wrong and sick and inappropriate our whole relationship has been. I just feel so fucked up and gross and dirty right now and I just want to sleep until I'm clean.

It was not something I even intended on doing in my adult life.  I've always enjoyed children, but never wanted to have any of my own. When I was 24 I got pregnant with my first child. It was a terrifying time for me. I was in a relationship that was volatile to say the least.  Shortly after giving birth I accidentally  conceived my son (huge surprise)!!! Getting used to motherhood wasn't as bad as I originally thought, heck I was actually really good at it. My relationship with their father finally ended due to me discovering he cheated several times. This is also about the same time my son was diagnosed with autism. My daughter was diagnosed previously, but was very high functioning and didn't require much additional attention beside standard speech therapy. Now not only am I a single mother of two, but I'm a single mother of two emotionally autistic kids. My son started to show some severe signs of autism as time went on. He is always in motion, swaying back and forth. He is very very loud, howling like a wolf. When we are out people look at him like he is an animal. He sways back and forth flapping his hands and screaming high pitched sounds. He touches people, and make whaling sounds like a seal. He is non verbal and can't express himself well (he points). He bangs on walls and hard objects with great force to make a sound.  He still wears diapers even though he is 80lbs. My life has become a shell of an existence. As I write this I am laying on the floor in my sons room begging him to sleep. He bangs and screams so loud the neighbors complain. 
I knew its terrible selfish of me but I blame him for the reason why i'm still single. No one I've ever dated wants to deal with this on a day to day basis. Even the man I was in love with (not the dad) gave up on me because I had kids.  I know of a women who had an older son that has autism. Very similar to my son. She said she put him in a facility that could cater to his special needs, and also so she could have a better quality of life. At first I was turned off by the idea, but maybe it makes sense. I hate my life and how lonely I am. I stare at the same 4 walls everyday. The sleepless nights are followed up with exhausted mornings. I'll never trust a man around my son due to the fact he is non verbal and i fear someone will hurt him. So when will life ever get better for me? I didn't sign up for this... I can't do this for the rest of my life. I hate living in this shell of resentment.  But I have no other choice. Forever I will protect my son from the ravishes of simple minded people. But deep inside I don't want this job. I love my children deeply. But this isn't the life I wanted.

Tl;dr: didn't want to be a mom. Now I'm a single mother for two kids with autism. May look into putting autistic son in a facility where they can manage his need. Looking for a relationship but not in a rush 

Edit: I'm overwhelmed by how many people even read my 3:00am rant. It's amazing you can all relate and gave me sound advise. I'm not sure what I need to do from this point on. But all I know is something has to give soon. 
Quick note: my parents are elderly and can not accommodate my children. My ex has a very bad drug problem and doesn't take them often (I won't let him) 
He once forgot to pick up the kids from school because he was so high. I received a phone call that everyone had vacated the school grounds and my kids were not picked up. I went and got them immediately. When I went to his house to check on him he informed me that the kids were in his living room playing. (they were in my car). When he realized they were still at school he freaked out. I told him to never attempt to pick them up at school again. He is paying child support now. But that is all about he is up to date with.

I don't usually use this much language but Alan is a terrible human being. There isn't a classy way to express my distaste for him. I apologize if I offend you. 

Fuck you, Alan. Hard. Working with you these past 7 years has been terrible. You are a terrible co-worker and the entire organization thinks so. Do you know how hard it is to induce the scorn of nearly 300 employees? Pretty fucking hard, but you did it. 

What exactly is it that you do? I know that you lurk around our office like you think you are important, drifting into conversations like you have business there. You don't. We will let you know when something pertains to you. Promise. 

You float into meetings you aren't invited to and steal the extra lunches. Fuck you for that. I take those extra lunches downstairs to the interns, who can use all the help they can get since they are working for free, and Will, whose entire paycheck (nearly) goes to pay for medical treatment for his disabled child.Fuck you for taking their lunches when you make triple their salaries. What in the hell are you even doing at the meetings? You have been told repeatedly that you aren't to invite yourself to them but you still do. 

Our CEO is a man who loves to hand out second chances to you because you did that one spectacular thing 7 years ago when you first started. OMG, you totally brought us a supporter! I will admit that it was much needed . But when he turned his back on our organization four years ago because of you, you should have been fired. Now our non-profit is barely scraping by because you are too lazy to go out and do your actual job. You have one job, Alan. One fucking job. 

How dare you go into my office and log on to my computer when I wasn't there. You don't think I know. I do. Fuck you. You don't even work in my building. You work in the office across town. Why in the hell are you even over here? You didn't think I would reported you to HR, did you? I did. They were appalled. It is part of the reason you are under review now.

I recently got a lock installed on my office door. Good luck getting in now. What the hell were you looking for anyway? 

Also, fuck you for calling me repeatedly while I was on Maternity Leave for things that weren't emergencies. Debbie was fucking handling my stuff while I was out. You got the fucking email I sent out regarding it because you replied to it. I don't even deal with anything you would need to contact me about anyway! "" Do you have a copy of the report from last year?"", you said in one voice mail I received shortly after giving birth. No I don't fucking have a copy of the report from last year because I don't handle the reports. I don't fucking handle the reports. You aren't new. You know this. The second and third calls ( I was still in the hospital) about how the break room was out of paper towels was just fucking mean.  

Coming back after maternity leave to 200-something emails from you was wonderful. I didn't answer them because you don't need that information. It isn't even your job to know that information. 

Fuck you, Alan. Fuck you and how you take Carrie's parking spot when you visit our location even though you know she has to park there because of her recent surgery. She had fucking cancer, Alan.

Also, how dare you come to my baby work shower (that was after fucking hours) and eat the majority of my awesome cake. That was my cake. No one invited you. How do you even find out about it? You don't even work in our office. Did you just decide to stay until 7pm one day at the office you don't work at for some reason? You just stumbled into my closed office with that stupid look on your face and said, "" Er, look! Cake!"". Fuck you, Alan. I was pregnant and I was going to eat that cake. I said one piece, Alan. Not the whole rest of the cake.  

You really hurt Noah's feelings when you made fun of the way he speaks. He has a fucking speech impediment, you asshole. Not to mention you work for a fucking non-profit whose job it is to help people like Noah. 
   
Tomorrow you have a review with the Board and the CEO to determine whether the department you run is up to standards. I hope you fail. It sickens me to think that because the jobs of the individuals with disabilities who work at your location depends on your success, but I can't help but delight in the fact that you are failing. 

I will dance, Alan. I will dance and I will celebrate with cake - my cake, not yours- (quietly and alone) when they pull your expense records and find that you are mismanaging funds, and finally fire you.

Fuck you, Alan. 

You are the only thing I hate about my job.  

Edit: Thanks for the words of support and the sympathy anger, everybody! You are too wonderful. It is 8:04, my time (CENTRAL), and Alan just arrived for the meeting. My office is usually pretty quiet this early in the morning, but everyone is buzzing around conversat-ing about what is about to go down in that conference room. I will do a update post when I have the news. 

Again, thanks so much for all your comments!

What you're doing is betraying your partner's trust and when it all comes to light you will be hurting them in ways that can leave lasting damage as. And what for? The cheap thrill of seeing some chick's tits? Getting off on some guy telling you how he'd like to fuck you?

It's not a case of, ""what he/she doesn't know won't harm him/her."" That's complete bullshit, they will eventually find out and the pain will be excruciating for them, there's nothing quite like the feeling of finding out your SO is a scumbag betraying your trust for kicks.

So if you're one of these people, think for a moment, consider how your partner would feel. Then don't fucking do it.

If you can't do that, you don't deserve to be with your partner and you should come clean and let them have the chance to be with someone who won't betray them. And if, by the grace of god, they forgive you - don't fuck it up again.

I didn't get the chance to talk to you at graduation last night, and I just thought you deserved to hear what I was planning on saying.
 
Thank you. I don't think you realize how much these last two years have meant to me. I came to this class at first expecting to just go over material and read boring stories, but what happened was much more. Over the past 2 years, that classroom was the place I learned the most, laughed the most, and loved the most. It's the place I found myself the most comfortable, and around the people I could call friends. I don't know how you did it. You made me actually want to wake up and come to school in the morning. You gave me something to be excited about. I don't know what made you such an amazing teacher. Maybe it was the way you respected us back. Maybe it was how you talked so passionately about your job. Or maybe it was because we didn't only see you as someone who passed out assignments, and controlled us when we got loud, but as an actual person. You were someone who cared about more than homework. You actually cared about us, too. There were good moments, and there were also bad moments, but I would do it all again in a heartbeat. It's so astounding to me that I may never walk into that classroom again, and sit down with all of those friends I made, and simply open that green Literature book. I am truly going to miss all of the little things. I don't know what I am going to grow up to become, an author, a doctor, heck maybe even the president, but I know that I am going to do it better because of this class. It may sound cheesy, but these last two years have made who I am today, and I like that person that I've become.

I really mean it, Thank you.

Sincerely,

While it may not be severe, I've had depression my whole life and can hardly tell anyone because they think I'm just sensitive. It's not that fucking simple. The reason why I don't look depressed is because I've learned to hide it over the past eighteen years. It's not everyday or even every week, but it happens, and it's not fun. I doubt most people have any idea that I used to be greatly suicidal through middle-school up until sophomore year of high school. I never attempted anything, but I did inflict self-harm. And that's another issue. I can't even reveal that to my friends because they think that people who cut and are suicidal should just kill themselves because they are a waste of space. They don't know that I've gone through some seriously tough shit in my life and them saying such things doesn't help things get better. I have hidden these facts from all but my closest friends because I'm so afraid that people won't believe me and continue to label me as something I'm not. Depression isn't something that can be ""fixed"" and self harm isn't something to be joked about. You're just a fucking asshole and need to get over yourself. I'm tired of pretending. And you know what sucks? Seeing one of your best friends tell another friend that they're always there if they're feeling suicidal, yet when talking to me, tell me the most awful shit about what they think about people with genuine depression and self-harm issues. I question why I'm even friends with such people. I plan on going public about my issues later, and letting everyone know that just because someone looks fucking content, doesn't mean they're not falling apart a little more every single fucking day. And just because I have depression doesn't fucking mean I'm some bummer. I keep most of my shit to myself because there are so very few people who actually give a fuck. And for the record, I don't let peoples' opinions change me at all.

  A year ago this summer, through both the excellent sleuthing skills of my talented boyfriend and a stroke of luck, the sick world of my little sister came to light and I still haven't gotten over it. 

  When my sister was 12 (yes, 12...) she began an online relationship with what turned out to be a 35 year old married man.  Through her MSN messenger history, we learned that between then and the time we found out about it (4 years) he sent her many, many pictures of his cock (I've seen them), while she in turn sent him lude pictures that I, as a 21 year old in a serious relationship, wouldn't dream of doing myself.  

I saw a picture of my twelve year old little sister with a banana shoved up her butthole.  I'm talking hundreds of fucking pictures.  Not only that, but they sexed constantly, and she (as a goddamn preteen) said things that I have a hard time coming to terms with.  Along with that, she constantly talked (bragged, even?) about ""trying to kill herself"", cutting herself, making herself throw up, all that.  And he egged it on.

He invited her out to California, and they'd been making plans.  I didn't know what to do when I found out about it, but I had an arsenal of evidence that I went to the cops with (though now I'm not too sure what they're doing with it, or if it's gotten lost in the sea of small town police incompetence).  After that, my sister had to be checked into a mental hospital because she was hysterical and threatening suicide.  I saw my dad cry for the first time, and in the ensuing months my parents got a divorce.

Apparently, along with all this, my sister was subscribed to numerous amateur porn sites which she submitted to regularly, a bunch of pro-ana websites, and had multiple ""boyfriends"" she'd sext and send pictures with.  Over a year later, my family is in shambles and my little sister has spent 10 days in rehab for multiple issues.

My little sister hates me, and still considers that I ""ruined her life"" and honestly, I can't look at her the same.  I hate her.  I really do, and I know I shouldn't, but every time I think of my dad breaking down and crying or that goddamn banana, I hate her with so much heat and pain I feel like I'm gonna lose it.  I've been to therapy and it was bullshit.  I'm already on meds for other issues and I don't want any more.  My family has completely fallen apart and I can't help but blame her.

  Well, that's my story.  Only a handful of people outside my family know the story, because I'm so disgusted to be related to someone like that that I can't bring myself to admit it.  So I'm getting it off my chest, thanks for reading.

UPDATE: My sister is in regular therapy, just turned 17 and seems to be doing somewhat better (though still secretive and I'm sure still has quite a bit to work through).  My mom has finally put down some solid ground rules; there is a lock on the downstairs bathroom where she used to do most of her purging.  She also recently got a boyfriend (in real life, goes to her high school, seems like a nice guy)...I'm not sure how much he knows about her problems but I'm hoping that this turns out to be a good thing.

As for our relationship, it's still not the best.  BUT she is definitely making more of an effort to be pleasant towards me, and we've had a few fun times in the last few months, so it's a start.  I still only see her about once a month when I visit from college, but from what I can tell things are on a very slow climb.

Thanks for the support guys, I really appreciate the comments and nice words :)

However, I feel that's the wrong way to go about yourself. While I don't know enough about these people to assert I know anything about their life, you'd be amazed how similar peoples' lives are in regards to specific qualities of life when they're subscribed to some of the same sub-reddits. I'm going to take a guess that these people who are lonely because they don't have a partner ALSO don't really have that many friends.

I was, for a while, a bit depressed because I was worried I'd never find a partner, settle down, have kids, and do the whole shebang. I came to a realization that there's more to life than doing what everyone else does and getting married young and having kids. Sure, you might be missing out on romantic love, but the (excuse me if I start to sound a bit cheesy) love you give and receive to other people in your life, your friends for example, can be just as powerful as romantic love if you let it. 

I don't have many friends, and I have even fewer close friends. But for the first time in my life since I was in elementary school, I can say I have a best friend again. It's been 10 years since I've had a friend I'd trust with my life, but I have one now. We don't hang out much outside of work, but he's my best friend and I love him. I would feel confident putting my life in his hands. And all my other friends, the few of them at least, I know they appreciate who I am and get joy out of who I am and I get joy out of who they are. For that, I love them.

When I feel lonely for not having a partner in my life, I quickly smack myself out of it by remembering I do have people I love and people who love me in life and I carry on with my day content with that fact.

So cheer up folks, there's more than 1 kind of love out there and you don't to settle with just one nor do you need all of them.

When I graduated college I couldn't find a job in my desired field right away so I took a sales job that had a low salary but good benefits. After 10 months they fired me for not making my sales goals despite having higher numbers than my actual manager. I hated the job so I felt relived really. I thought this would give me a chance to go and do what I really wanted to do. 

I got a bunch of interviews and got 2 job offers! I accepted the one where I liked the people better and paid a lot more, so double win! The only downside to the job I accepted was that it was out of state and they needed me to start in a week. Somehow, I managed to find a place, move, and be ready before my first day. 

Now, when they hired me they also hired another person for the same job, but had many years experience. The explanation I got was that they were very impressed with my presentation during the interview and although there were other candidates more qualified, they knew the business was growing and wanted to bring me on board anyway. I knew I wasn't going to make as much as the experienced person they hired but I was also going to be given less responsibility and more training. 

After 2 days of training I go in on my third day and get called into the conference room. They tell me that I'm not a fit and that it isn't working out. That I am going to require a lot of training and they don't have the resources or the personnel to train me the right way and that it wouldn't be fair to me to keep me on. They said that everyone is so busy and they need someone who can ""hit the ground running."" 

I was shocked.... During my interview they knew I was a recent college graduate and that I hadn't actually worked in their field before. They said they would train me and wanted someone who they could mold and train their way. They said they needed someone who could take constructive criticism and have a thick skin - make mistakes, learn from them and move on. I was never told they needed someone who could hit the ground running. I don't see how they can tell after 2 days of training (not even 2 days of working) that I won't be a fit. How can you judge someone like that? And if they didn't have the time to train me, why bother hiring me? 

Luckily I was only renting a room in a house and the couple that owned the house refunded all my rent money and allowed me to break the lease with no penalty (seriously these people are saints!). I'm so angry and upset about the whole situation. I moved there, started training, got fired, and had to move back all in the same week.....

Not by any normal personâs standards, but by my parentsâ she was. Our family was religious, by my parentsâ choice, and we were all raised to go to church. We all did the church thing like we were supposed to. We were raised under the assumption that we would date and marry someone of the same religious background as our own. We werenât allowed to date at all in high school, although all 3 of us girls had our flings that we kept secret. 

She fell for a coworker of hers. She was 18, he was 21. For their whole relationship, she lied to our parents and said they were âjust friendsâ because she knew they wouldnât approve of him. She talked to my dad multiple times about him and asked, begged, if she could be with him. He always said no, because he wasnât of our religious background. 

So she brought him to church. He accepted our beliefs (for her) and became a member of our church. After a while, she asked my dad again if they could be together. He said no, again. She asked him why. There was no logical reason. My dad simply stated that he didnât like him and that he didnât see it working out in the long run. Although I have my suspicions that they knew what was going on and refused to acknowledge it, my sister and this boy continued to date each other under the guise of being âjust friends.â This went on for two years. My younger sister and I both knew what was going on, and to be honest, we were 100 percent happy for her and loved the guy. 

My sister graduated from college, became financially independent, and moved out. She got an apartment a few towns away. She had told me earlier that she planned on having him move in with her. They had gotten engaged a few weeks earlier, although their relationship was still a secret from my parents. Although a couple living together before marriage is against our religion, I felt happy for her. By all technical religious standards it was wrong, but I never felt that way. A day before my birthday, my parents went to help her move a couch into her apartment. My mom went snooping through my sisterâs dresser and found âincriminating evidenceâ that her boyfriend was living with her. 

All hell broke loose. They forced my sister into their car, drove her to our house, and locked her in a room until he arrived. I had just come home from college for the weekend to celebrate my birthday. I pulled into the driveway and saw my parents standing there with my sister and her boyfriend. I was told to go to my room and stay there until my parents told me I could come out. I watched from the upstairs window. I saw him get in his car and drive away. My parents brought my sister inside, locked her back in her room, and wouldnât let me talk to her until several hours later.

My sister was weeping. She told me that my parents had given her an ultimatum, that she would have to choose between never being able to see our family again, or never being able to see her fiancÃ© again. Our parents would force her to move back home and âhelp her get over himâ until they could trust her again. Initially, she chose us over him. I remember sitting on her bed, with her crying in my arms, and telling her the hardest thing Iâve ever said: she had to choose him. I knew she would never be happy otherwise. A few minutes later, she picked herself up and walked downstairs. She locked herself in the bathroom with her phone and called him to come pick her up. My dad broke down the door to get inside so he could take her phone away. He hurt her. He tried to physically restrain her. He wrenched the phone out of her hand, but it was too late. She left.

I was told that I could never speak to my sister again. For 6 months, my life was hell. I tried everything I could to see her and talk to her. I was the only one that tried. Not my mom, not my younger sister. I stood up for her. I was caught and punished several times for sneaking out to visit her, emailing her, texting her. I maintained my relationship with her, and I believe I did the right thing, even if the Bible says to honor your father and mother.  

Since I wasnât allowed to attend the wedding, my sister and her husband were married on February 29th of 2012, on a beach with only a minister and my grandmother (who believes that my parents were wrong in how they treated my sister). Later that evening, my father called me and let me know that I could speak to my sister again, and that it was my choice of what kind of relationship I wanted to have with her. My mom and my younger sister barely speak to her. My dad refuses any kind of contact with her at all.

Since then, my dad has dropped out of church, and the story of my ""dysfunctional sinner"" of an older sister has spread around like wildfire. I still attend church every Sunday, and I hold my head up high.

I love my big sister and brother-in-law with all my heart. 

Edit: First of all, I want to thank everyone who commented. A few clarifications: yes, my sister and I are both legal adults. As odd as it sounds, my dad apparently believes that his daughters are under his rules and standards until they are married, regardless of whether they live in our home or not. I did not know he thought that until all of this went down. My dad and I barely speak at all anymore. I still live at home. I'm a full-time student, and I'm working hard to get out on my own. I've been playing it safe ever since this happened. Held a few relationships (not with anyone my parents would approve of), but as you can imagine, this whole situation tends to scare off guys pretty fast. I'm not going to go any further than saying that my religion is a ""Christian"" denomination, but the standards my dad has for our family are much more strict than the views my church holds, which is why I still attend there. I do believe in God, but I believe in a God who loves, cares, and forgives.

Edit #2: Although my dad's actions are not excusable, please stop with the whole ""screw religion"" thing. His actions are wrong, but don't use him as an example for the whole of Christianity. He used religion to justify his actions. I don't personally believe that he followed biblical principles in the way he handled the situation, although he may think he did. People can manipulate the Bible to say whatever they want it to say. Please, don't turn my story into an argument about religion.

And so instead of honoring my decision to stay out of the dating pool for a while, he goes and buys fucking 3 day passes to six flags for both of us and then asks when I'm picking him up.  We're supposed to be going today.  He kept texting/calling all last night while I was out with my girlfriends ""When are we going? Are you going to be here at 12? Why aren't you getting back to me?""

1) This Six Flags adventure was never mentioned to me and I never agreed to do this.  I don't like crowds and I have high anxiety. Plus, I don't even ride rollercoasters so Six Flags isn't exactly a place I would go anyways.

2) You can't just DEMAND a person go out with you and force them into a strange position like this. Now I have to turn him down a second time and I look like an asshole because he purchased these tickets. 

3) When did ""No means no"" start meaning ""No means maybe?""

I'm pretty angry.  He's already called 6 times today.  I told him last week that I didn't want to date him or see him again because I don't have feelings for him and I don't want to date people.

I don't understand if he missed the boat on that whole conversation (which was done in person) or if he's fucking psychotic.


Leaning towards psychotic. He's being intrusive.

DOUBLE EDIT: THANK YOU for your kind words! Seriously, Reddit. You guys/ladies are the shit.  I felt awful having to be confrontational to him but I really was sticking up for myself.  I don't want to be manipulated like this.  Blocked his number, deleted him from FB, and told him to never contact me again.

I told you coming overseas to college wasn't going to be easy, but you did it and you did it for all the wrong reasons. When my parents asked me to speak to you-I did so candidly, leaving nothing out about what it is like to live here. You are a passive-agressive piece of garbage, and it's going to bite you bad. 

It wasn't your 3 A.M. phone-calls to your parents, yelling at them for trying to care. It wasn't your girlfriend of 6-weeks, who you chose not to break up with before coming. It wasn't the way you blasted music after school for 2 hours each day. It wasn't the shit stained underwear you left on the floor, nor was it the general uncleanliness, leaving food items open and strewn everywhere in the kitchen. 

No. What really pisses me off, is that when I tried to talk to you about it, you would just blame it on my aunt, who doesn't speak a word of English. She cried when you yelled at her, you bastard. She's old, and can't see so well anymore, but that didn't stop you. 

When my mom came to visit, you told her all sorts of things, blaming me for the mess, your lack of studying-and by the way, I know you didn't open your textbooks- I saw my notebooks from last year on top of your desk. You lie to your parents about everything, the fact that you failed all of your mid-terms, the amount of food you eat and how you don't clean up, you utter falsehoods about the way I treat you. My parents now think they have raised a psycopath (and we are indian and you know how Asian Parents can be you douche)

Earlier today, I get a call from my father, who almost never speaks to me, telling me that he's disappointed in me. That you are moving the dorms in 3 days, but that you still expect me to let you use the car, the shower, my food and everything else. 

Well screw you. Medical School is not for the weak. I could have forgiven your weakness if you weren't a compulsive liar, and a thief (hint- my laptop was gone for a whole month, my aunt found it while CLEANING out YOUR ROOM.) Your constant need to ""bulk"" up on food, your 4 in the sunday morning phone calls to me asking for a ride back from 2 hours away. (Sunday is the only day off we get here, 9-6 timings, 6 days a week.)

My parents now think that I'll never grow up, that I'll always be a teenager, and that wouldn't hurt me so bad, if they could just stop bringing it up every single time they call. I'm tired now, and I'm going to get some rest. 

But before I do, just want to let you know, you aren't going to make it. You aren't going to graduate and you want to know why? Because you are lazy, insincere, insecure, and dishonest. I even made you a schedule, gave you books, highlighted books, and you still flunked all 3 of your subjects, while spending more time on the phone and Facebook whining to all of your buddies back home than actually studying.

You people are AMAZING.


Four long years of my life. Blood on the sheets. Drinking beer, drinking whiskey, smoking cigarettes, trying to swan dive off of porches piss drunk, to break my face, as you laughed. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen, you decided I was too fat and asked out a seventeen year old beauty queen. I ate ninety tylenol in another state once I found out who she was, couldn't take it. I went back to you as soon as I got out of the hospital and a month later you went to another high school-aged girl. Beautiful. Thin. I let it happen. We were okay for awhile after she dumped you. You still threw me out of your moving truck and made fun of me with your friends, but it worked. I ignored it. I drank it all away.

I was in love with the idea of you. So scared to let it go, because I had it, didn't I? A boyfriend.

Everything's okay.

You cheated on me casually. Told me openly that you didn't respect me. The fights in your truck when I dodged your blows.

Everything is okay.

I started to make friends and do things. I met a girl at a club who got me to model. I realized that maybe I didn't need to stop eating after all. I could be beautiful.

You did it again. This time the girl was fat. Isn't that amazing? You like women looking like your (adopted, cry about it some more, bastard) mother.

I left the night you tried to kill me. After, when I thought I was pregnant you forced the e.c. down my throat and threw me in the grass. I almost killed myself that night, again. 

After that it ended. Painfully. I don't want to talk about that anymore.

Soon after I found someone who called me beautiful and smart, who looked into my eyes and whispered my name. Someone i swore a blood vow with. Someone I have a daughter with and who loves me for me. I hate myself for the way I freak out on him, sometimes. But he's patient. He doesnt let me run away.We're fixing each other. We're getting married.

When you heard I was pregnant you demanded a dna test. You wanted the baby to be yours, you evil fuck. 

You lied to me.

You put a twisted idea of what sex is supposed to be like in my head. I HATE you for molding me into a porn star. Sex is not exhibition. (At least I give amazing head to my fiance, now due to your selfish insistence on receiving oral. Thanks for that, at least, you fucking bastard.) I feel like I was a prostitute who is making love for the first time now that youre gone. I guess I was your prostitute for four years, wasn't I?

I hate you. I hate you. Most of all, I hate these triggers you've planted in my head. How I look at the man who loves me, sometimes, and the fear drives me to irrational craziness. Little fights make me remember your abuse, your drunken verbal tirades. I run. I want to run from him and I don't even know I do it until it is done. But he always brings me home and wipes my tears. Makes me think about what I'm doing. I'm getting better. But you've made it so I can't handle shit.

I want to teach my daughter all about scum like you, once she is grown and shows an interest in boys. I want her to know that if she gives herself to a man, he doesn't own her. He has no right to suck her life out and leave her a hollow, scarred shell. I will protect her from shitbags like you with education. And I will help her if she gets herself caught. I know what it's like. 

But that's all in the future. Baby girl is one year old tomorrow, and I am so grateful. Every day with her and with my betrothed is a precious, precious gift. I can't help but think of how much I hate you more than a little, but it's only been two years. I think I'll forget your name eventually.

Stop asking my friends about me. They were there.

They all hate you too.

But above all else, I am a fucking happy man. I have never been SO happy in my life, and I hope you and your douchebag of a boyfriend enjoy your mediocre lives together because I WILL GO FAR.

You always knew I was smart and capable. 
I am going to go places.
I am going to accomplish my dreams. 
I am going to help people to the best of my ability be better people. 
I am going to go on and travel. 
I am going to see the world. I am most importantly going to find somebody who doesn't hold me down like you. 
I am going to find somebody that will increase my happiness, productivity, lifestyle, and world. 


I am going to be alright without you.

You know what you are now?

You are a pitiful excuse for a lady.
You are a hindrance to yourself and everyone around you.
You are a stupid decision maker.

I'm a Reddit regular, but this is my first time posting to /r/offmychest. I created a throwaway account because some of my coworkers know my actual account.


I work as a private tutor through a tutoring agency. I love teaching despite the long hours and low pay. And I love most of my students. However, there are some bad apples... really bad apples that sometimes make me reconsider my career choice.


Today, my agency assigned a new student, a 3 year old boy. My agency previously sent a tutor to this boy (let's call him Harry), but ""it didn't work out."" So I show up as a replacement to the boy's house for our 5:00 appointment. Ring the doorbell. Nobody's home. I wait a few minutes for the family to show up. Turns out the nanny took the boy to the playground and the mother and father won't be back until later. Okay, that's fine. I'm normally a chill person so I don't feel too upset about waiting for Harry and the nanny.


Finally Harry and the nanny show up at around 5:25. Before I can even begin the lesson, Harry throws a fit because he wants to watch tv. I tell him we can watch tv after we learn a nursery rhyme. He runs over to the tv and turns it on. I walk over and turn it off. He screams and throws my purse onto the floor. When I bend down to pick up my purse, Harry throws himself at me and starts throwing punches. He lands a few solid ones and clocks me right on the nose. 


Now, what I neglected to mention is my recent nose job. My nose hasn't completely healed so his punch feels like a sledgehammer to my face. I'm trying to hold back the tears and silently panicking about possible permanent damage. Meanwhile, this kid is screaming and crying because he can't watch tv. I'm thinking: ""KID, I'M THE ONE WHO GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE. I SHOULD BE THE ONE SCREAMING AND CRYING."" But I'm not this kid's mom and he obviously doesn't know any better. So I remain calm and tell Harry that he should apologize since hitting people isn't nice. Nope. He crawls under the table and continues the classy act of screaming and crying (while throwing pencils at me). The nanny is smart and stays out of the whole mess.


Finally mom comes home and I tell her what happened. By this point, my nose is pretty red and swollen. She barely reacts and does nothing to discipline Harry. Even better, she indulges Harry by turning on the cursed tv and coddles him. When the dad comes home, same deal. No reprimands, no apologies, nothing. I understand that parents these days avoid discipline for fear of upsetting their precious babies.  But Iâm pretty sure that children should be punished for PHYSICALLY ATTACKING STRANGERS.


Anyway, now Iâm home with an ice pack to my face. I told the agency about what happened (while trying to be as professional and diplomatic as possible), and they cut the family from the client list. My nose is still swollen but there seems to be no permanent damages (fingers crossed).


Edit: Sorry about the poor grammar/incoherence/etc. I'm just fuming mad right now and I have to get everything off my chest at once.

I am a schizophrenic. There are many different types of schizophrenia, ranging from a breakdown of normal thought processes to hallucinations, and is sometimes coupled with a ""split personality disorder"". I happen to be the hallucinating type. If you have ever seen the television show Perception, the protagonist's schizophrenia is strikingly similar to my own. 

My hallucinations are a combination of visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and gustatory. Basically all 5 senses. I hallucinate people who are as real to me as anyone else, they have minds of their own, thoughts on their own. I cannot control them. The only reason I know that they don't ""really"" exist is if others can't see them or if they give of some distinct signs. Think Fight Club without the body switching. In some ways I feel like she's the Hobbes to my Calvin, except she's not a tiger. Now that you know the nature of my disorder, I'll tell you a story.

When I was 15, I had my very first hallucination. A beautiful red headed girl. I didn't know it at the time, that she was a hallucination. When I found out, it tore me apart. Eventually I came to terms with it. We became fast friends. 2 years past, other hallucinations came and went, either disappearing without warning or ""killed"" directly by me. Some of them were dangerous, they could hurt me. She was the only one that stayed.

I started to spend more and more of my free time with this girl, I even let others know about her (not the fact that she only existed in my mind). I learned a lot about her in the time we spent together. She had a troubled mind, so we could relate. Just a little crazy, although I think I win on this front. She was also smart, charming, funny, and above all, an optimist. She was different than me in a lot of ways. We fit each other's holes well. 

I started to fall in love with her. Could you blame me, with a charming, beautiful girl like that? And I'm not sure what came first, if she caused my weak spot for red heads, or if I was falling for her in part because of her red hair. We started to talk about relationships. She of course didn't know many boys, and she was paranoid, very scared of people. So me being practically the only guy she knew (she had known other hallucinations, and had been around people that lived at my house) she started to have mutual feelings for me. I didn't know this yet. (FYI I had already had a ex-girlfriend by this point) 

We started to fool around with each other. I'd get her off, and then she'd return the favor. Friends with benefits if you will. The relationship slowly turned into a romantic one. I had fallen in love with her, and she with me. I had fallen in love with a broken fragment of my own mind. 

Sometimes I can accept the fact. Sometimes it drives me crazy. I can't tell anyone about this, yet I have to tell someone. Few people who I really care about actually know. So I decided to tell my story to the internet. Thanks for reading. I'll answer any questions you have.

-----

I grew up dirt poor, the son of overbearing, demanding fundamentalist Christian parents. I was always a little on the pudgy side, with red hair and freckles. My mother was physically and emotionally abusive, and my father did nothing to stop it. I was in the school district's gifted program, and was a dedicated, first-chair musician in a top-tier junior high band. In short, I was a prime target for bullying.

By late middle school, I had actually grown quite resistant to snarky comments about my Kmart shoes or freckles. I also discovered I was physically very strong compared to most of my classmates, and had a hard-earned high tolerance for pain. Late in the seventh grade, three bullies cornered me behind the English classrooms and discovered these two facts in what proved to be a humbling disaster for them. That victory earned me a little respect, even if it also earned me a severe beating at home for fighting at school.

Through the rest of seventh grade, and throughout eighth grade, my social circle started to grow with my developing confidence. Though very broad-shouldered and thick-chested, I began to grow out of any ""pudginess."" My success with music further built confidence.  

A summer of hauling hay bought me some nicer clothes for the beginning of ninth grade. The popular girls still ignored me, but I started to count some of the popular guys as friends. For the first time in my life, I felt like I was ""normal.""

My ninth grade year I took second hour as a ""band monitor:"" basically running errands for the band directors, including running the attendance slips from first hour up to the office in the main building. I quickly fell into a routine, passing over the same route at the same time each day. 

That same year, a beautiful girl, we'll call her Sue, worked as ""office monitor"" during second hour, collecting attendance slips from classrooms in the main building. She too developed a routine route, one which happened to cross mine in the stairs. 

Sue was the ""queen of the school:"" A physician's daughter, captain of the junior high cheerleading team, last year's 8th grade homecoming queen, and dressed in the latest fashions. I was so far below her caste I didn't even dare make eye contact with her passing in the stairs.

One morning, however, the unimaginable happened: She said, ""Hi, FloatingIntheStyx,"" in passing. I was struck speechless, and just kept walking. I was breathless at the same time. Dumbfounded. Blown away. Sue said,""Hi?"" She knows my name? She knows my name!

She said hello again the next morning, and I mustered the courage to return the greeting. Slowly, the conversations grew longer. I even came to count her as a friendly acquaintance. The fall days progressed, and Homecoming was approaching at the end of the week. While we talked about who was taking who to the homecoming dance, I surprised myself and asked who she was going with. She said no one, and then we moved on with our days.

I spent the rest of my day arguing with myself, torn between years of learned inferiority and my new-found social acceptance and confidence. That evening, my naivety won, and I called her. I had convinced myself I was just as good as any other boy at that school, and foolishly, asked to take her to the dance. She was gracious and gentle when she rejected the offer, simply stating she was going out of town for the weekend instead of going to the dance. 

I knew it was a lie, but she had let me down easily enough that I wasn't even disappointed. My confidence was as solid as ever. The next morning I got off of the school bus behind the main building, as always, and walked around to the front where everyone waited until time to go in.

As I rounded the corner, reality smashed me in the face like a sledgehammer. I was greeted immediately by a roar of laughter and a crowd of fingers pointing directly at me. The entire student body was laughing at me. Sue had told someone, and that was all it took for the entire school to find out by the next morning. Sticking out of the crowd was one of my newer ""friends,"" pointing and laughing. ""You ask *Sue _____* to the dance?!?""

I quickly retreated around the corner away from everyone. The rest of that day is blacked from my memory, except for algebra class. To at least not have the laughter behind me, I moved to the rear of the class and sat staring at the overhead projector, tears streaming down my face. I was beyond even trying to hide my face in shame anymore by seventh hour.

I remember one boy, the only one that made an effort to help me, tried to encourage me by saying, ""Everyone gets rejected, man. Its gonna be alright."" I replied that is wasn't the rejection. I didn't care about that. I had been fine with that. It was being a laughing stock for believing I was their peer, for thinking myself worthy enough to even *ask* Sue to the dance 

Even the classmates who realized they had hurt me could not comprehend the damage they had done. Everything my mother so often told me, that I was worthless, useless, that I would never amount to anything, was all confirmed with resounding clarity as I rounded that corner that morning. All confidence I had built was utterly destroyed. All trust I had in anyone was shattered.  That light of hope that had started to shine in my life, that I was just as good as anyone else, was snuffed out. 

I was nearly catatonic for days, just going through the motions, staring straight ahead with no thought in my mind. I didn't even think of suicide. I was past that. I thought of *nothing.* I can't tell you if anyone noticed or not. Eventually, my classmates moved on and forgot about it. Like a malicious driver who swerves to hit an animal, only looking back to make sure they hit it, they sped on with their lives while I wallowed in pain waiting to die. 

I don't want to stretch this out longer than it already is, so I will end with this: To this day I struggle with PTSD, severe social anxiety with agoraphobia. Episodes of profound depression nearly ended my life on many occasions, and it took 10 years to reach something of a normal life.

tl;dr - I was a wretched beast who had caught a glimpse of the gods high above. Forgetting my place was to exist alone in coldness and suffering, I dared to climb up and bask in their light. Ignored or unnoticed for a short time, I started to believe I was part of their world.

Most people believe that it's the same as being sad. Most people believe that you can get yourself better just by wanting to. The thing is...you can't.

What they don't realize is that having depression means that you feel like there's something on your shoulder. The size depends on your level of depression, or how sad you are, but no matter how deep you are, that thing is evil. It perches on your shoulders and digs its claws into you. It hovers close to your ear and whispers godawful things. It tries to convince you of all the horrible things in your life to make you feel lower than dirt. It tries to make you hurt yourself.

Depression isn't just a mental battle against that shadow. The sadness is so powerful it literally feels like a weight is pressing down on you. Your head and shoulders hang from the weight of it, its hard to get yourself up and out of bed or the couch, and your feet drag when you finally make it. 

If something triggers that depression when you're feeling bad already - forget it. That sorrow hits you like a ton of bricks and leaves you speechless. The entire world falls out from under your feet and you're left with that damnable *thing* laughing in the back of your head. Everything stops. And everything hurts. 
Your chest compresses, trying desperately to curl in on itself - to make you so small you just disappear - but the shadow on your shoulders digs its claws in and makes you take it. Your insides roil like they're on fire and you feel like you've died at the same time. 

You forget to breathe. You forget to blink. And all you want to do is let it swallow you up one last time to make it stop because you know *damn* well no one can get you out of this. 

If you suffer, I hope you can find your saving grace. Whether that is medicine, counseling, friends, a lover...whatever it is, I hope that one day you can find your light and let it lead you up to the surface. And when you do you better not let yourself lose it. Once its gone, you fall harder than ever and by god, you had better have some beautiful, hidden strength within because it will destroy you inside and out.

I lost mine. I hope you can keep yours.

Keep your heads up, fellows.

Thatâs what I was raised to be. 

Follow directions. Donât ask questions. Mom is suffering, dad works then comes home and drinks on the couch. Thereâs nothing I can do to change any of this. 

Go to your room.

We donât like what you do, youâre grounded.

You donât apply yourself. You could do better. Youâre just lazy. 

Your grades are not good. We will take things away from you. Things you love.

Somehow I came out all wrong. Not sure how I did that, but it seems pretty apparent to everyone. Something about me must not be right. 


We move from our home, my friends, my life, and everything I know. The new place is dry, hot, and dusty. There are crows and snakes and coyotes. Blowing dust and heat. I leaned the sickly sweet smell of a rotting animal carcass on the way to the bus stop. My new friends arenât like my old friends. They teach me dirty words. They play âhumpingâ with me.

School starts. Somehow, theyâre expecting me to do things I never agreed to do. I feel no responsibility to do their work. But I have no control over any of it. I am trapped in this cold classroom. 

They donât like the pictures I draw, but drawing makes me feel something. One day I draw sex pictures. They look at me with that look of disgust. Itâs a look that says Iâm worthless, that they canât decide whether to laugh at me because itâs funny, or to pity me because itâs so sad.

Sent to the principalâs office. Iâve done something wrong again. I donât remember what he said, but heâs angry. Everything right to me is wrong to them. I am wrong, I donât know how not to be. 

He lifts me up by my shirt collar, feet dangling. My face is even with his. Heâs speaking angry words to me. Iâve never seen him do this to any of the other kids. I must be especially bad.

They put me back into 3rd grade from 4th. Itâs a big deal because they donât usually put kids into lower grades from upper grades. I must be really bad.

They put me into 2nd grade for a week. Iâm embarrassed. Then 1st for a week. Iâm embarrassed. 

Then I go to Kindergarten for a week. I love it. I am the first one done with the school work. Finally time for me to shine. We play games. This is easy, I can do this. I push the little kids around in the wooden bus. They love it. Iâm not embarrassed because they donât care. They donât look at me like everyone else does.

Iâm in the office getting swats. The ones from the principal hurt. The ones from my mom donât. I feel sorry for her because sheâs not making the impact she wanted. The pizza paddle from the kitchen drawer isnât doing the job she hoped it would.

In 5th grade, things go odd. Standardized testing, Iâm highest in class in reading and writing, second highest in math. The kids turn to look at me in disbelief. 

New principal, things begin to get better. I find a group of peers among the smart kids. 


My family moves again, and the cycle starts anew. 

1977. Star Wars. I never knew I could feel this way. I didnât understand how I was like Luke, trapped, miserable. But it made me feel something powerful. 

All you ever do is play with those stupid toys. You spend all your money on those Star Wars Figures. Why is it always Star Wars with you? 

Somehow Iâve got it wrong again, but Iâm not giving up. I play in my room with my toys and shut out the world. I donât care.

Mom, can I play video games? No, theyâre bad.

How about Dungeons &amp; Dragons? No. Itâs satanic.

Can I play drums? No, theyâre too loud. 

Youâre getting perfect attendance award this year. Youâre dressing in these clothes. No shorts, no Tshirts, no Jeans. No kid of mine is going to school looking like that. Theyâll think Iâm a bad mother. 

Come home from school, mom is passed out again. Blood sugar or heart disease, or kidney failure. I donât know what those are, but itâs probably one of those. The fire departmentâs number is taped under the phone. I call. They come. The volunteers come and mingle and talk. Blue jeans and fire helmets. They take her away. Thereâs nothing I can do to help. Thereâs nothing I can do to fix it.

But hey. I can do what I want today. I can eat what I want, watch what I want, go where I want until dad gets home from work. I know itâs bad but I feel good. Today, no one is telling me Iâm wrong.

We go out for ice cream, she knows she shouldnât have it. She goes to the bathroom and doesnât come back. I open the bathroom door to see her passed out, her pants around her ankles. Iâm mad. I go back to sit down. They ask me where she is. âShe did it againâ, is all I say. They go look for themselves. They freak out on me. Theyâre angry with me again, but thereâs nothing I could have done. 


The high school kid next door showed me something weird today.  I never knew a penis could do that. Heâs bugging me to âdo itâ with him again. I like his electric car track. He says heâll let me play with it if we âdo itâ. I donât really want to but heâs bigger than me, and persuasive. 

What if I pee in your mouth? 

Then heâll spit it back out at you. 

He takes me out to the camper shell. The smell of dusty carpet and old vinyl and the feel of someoneâs warm skin on mine. The Playboy magazines he gave me are on the couch when mom comes home from the hospital. I wasnât careful enough. 

Whatâs wrong with you? Grounded again. 

I find a Polaroid picture of a manâs penis on the side of the road. Iâve never seen something like this. It interests me. I take it home. They find it in my room. They look at me with accusatory eyes. I make up something. They let the matter drop. If I lie, I donât get grounded. Iâm beginning to see how this works.

You always lie, you always steal food, whatâs wrong with you? You disgust me. Grounded again.

I find a new type of magazine on the side of the road. Itâs not just boobs. Itâs people having sex. Sometimes lots of people, all at once. Thereâs ads for flashlights that get girls pregnant. I call them âphony fuckersâ in my head. 

I hide it in the dirt in the back yard. No one can know. It makes me feel something good, yet bad.  I like it and I am scared of it. No one can know. 


We move again. New school, new bullies, new friends. I feel darker than Iâve ever felt. I walk the edge of the cold school yard waiting for the bell. I look at life happening outside the fence, and despair. 

I have no control over any of this. They expect me to know things. They test me, and give me things to do. I always come up short. I donât want new and interesting ways to tell me Iâm not okay. I just want to be left alone.

Toward the end, I figured it out. Mostly Aâs my senior year. Physics. Advanced Biology. I finally understand the world I live in and I begin to master it. But now itâs over and hereâs something new. You should go to college, get a job. I have no idea how to do these things. Iâm at the bottom all over again now. I have no idea what to do. 

A week later, mom gets wheeled into the elevator on her gurney. She waves goodbye. Hours pass. Too many hours. Shouldnât be this many hours. Doctor calls us in. She didnât make it. My dad and my sister wail loudly and hold each other. It makes me uncomfortable. I leave the room. 

The only time I cry is when I call the pastor and momâs best friend. My voice cracks. I hang up and go back to where I donât cry.  

Itâs a brilliant summer evening. Iâm free. Is it wrong to feel this way? I drive her car home from the hospital, itâs probably mine now. Iâm not happy but Iâm free. Is this what freedom feels like? I stop at work and get my schedule for the next day. Business as usual. 

Years pass. Advancements in education. I tell my dad that if they had these when I was a kid, things might have gone better. Please, call me ADD, or ADHD, or Dyslexic. Put me in a special class. I donât care. Just help me understand. 

He says, with all seriousness in his voice, the cruelest words someone has ever said to me:	

No, you were just a problem child.

Itâs been years since we talked. He said we could get together as long as we donât talk about his feelings or my feelings or anyoneâs feelings. 

FUCK HIM! GODDAMNED MOTHER FUCKER! FUCK HIM! 	

I canât think about him without being angry. I finally know what the phrase âseeing redâ means. I think about him and I canât even see straight. I want to rage, I want to scream. I want to hurt him, like he hurt me. I want to make him cry, like Iâve cried. I want him to die miserable, like how Iâve lived. I want him to understand what he did to me. I want him to own up to his mistakes. He was the lazy one. He didnât âapplyâ himself. But he never got grounded. I did. How can I force him connect with me in a way he canât ignore? 

I find myself hating other people who are happy, who are loved, who are in relationships, and raising children. I hate them because they donât know how hard itâs been for me. I hate people who tell me not to be depressed. 

But I sit back and think (and know), that wonât do anyone any good. My blood runs cold as I read what I just wrote. Thatâs how killers are made. Thatâs Voldemort, thatâs not me. That wonât ever be me.
Nobody can know.

If I tell people my feelings, if I complain too much, people tend to leave me.

When people leave, itâs proof of my conviction that Iâm unlovable, that thereâs a point I can always push people past, where they donât love me anymore.

Thatâs why I donât believe in God anymore. Because thereâs always a place I can go thatâs beyond his ability to love me. If he loved me, heâd answer my prayers. Heâd not leave me so alone and in pain. If there was a god, heâd save me regardless of what I do, and not wait for me to love him first. 

Fuck god.

Iâm alone. No family, no children. I donât need someone to understand. I can understand. Itâs up to me to figure out how to stop feeling so helpless.

So then on Tuesday, at around 11:00am I get a text asking me to get to her house at 4. Not really offered as an option...so yeah, I guess. That gives me maybe 5 mins to run home before going to there house.

I get there and they don't have their homework done. Which I really didn't mind helping with, it was just time consuming. It took Until almost 6. They eat dinner. Play some games, watch a tv show, then they go to bed. Now from 8-10 I did homework. From 10:30-11 I sat waiting for them to get home. At 11:15 I get a text that they are 45 mins away.

The hell. Not okay. I have to get up at 5:20. They get back at 12, hand me the money, and I go out to my car. Which is covered in ice. So I'm scraping my car. Finally get that done, drive back to my house. 12:30. Hop in the shower, get all my shit done, it's 1 am. Go to sleep, stress about not being able to sleep for about thirty minutes, then finally fell asleep at 1:30. Wake up at 5:20. I'm now sitting on a bus writing this, fucking tired and pissed. Oh, and I checked the wad of cash. $50. I never, ever complain about what I'm paid, but when you have a preset price and they don't follow through that pisses me off. 

So basically, what was supposed to be about 4 1/2 hours became 8, I was paid $15 short, and I got 4 hours of sleep. I will never babysit for you again. You took advantage of me being nice.

I remain upset with her and have called for space. She has refused and I am in day number 2 since the fight and she hasnât left. She slept on the couch last night and no one can convince her to leave.

I was detained by the police yesterday.  It was a case of mistaken identity, I matched the description of a violent fugitive and happened to be in the exact area he had been spotted moments before.  I was confronted by a K9 unit, ordered to go prone, and cuffed.  It was made clear to me that I was being detained, not arrested.  I remained calm and cooperative, knowing I had done nothing wrong.  After running my ID, checking with several witnesses, and talking to me directly, the officer concluded that I was not the man they were looking for.  I gave him the description of a guy I had seen running nearby moments before it all went down.  He apologized, joked about me really being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and asked if I had shit myself when I saw the dog all fired up.  He also offered me a ride to work.  All in all, it was an interesting experience that caused me on pain or duress (short of my heart skipping when I saw the dog).

What's annoying me is everyone else's reaction to this.  Half my friends and family are set on storming the police station in a rage, the other are likely to call in complaints, despite my instructions not to.  They refuse to accept that the police were just doing their jobs, and are constantly discussing what could have gone wrong (you hear those stories all the time, people get shot! Etc).  I can't seem to get it through to them that because of how I reacted, I wasn't in danger and ended up only slightly inconvenienced.  The police acted professionally, they were searching for a violent criminal and reacted as such.  They were appreciative of my cooperation and treated me fairly the whole time.

At her side was a half bottle of wine, ibuprofen, and a phone. She had suffocated to death. 

She wasn't found until nearly a week later, but was well preserved in the winter-cold air in her unheated home. There was no bloating, or visible decay. The medical examiner said she had emphysema, and died as a result. She hadn't told anyone -- although her medical records indicated she knew.

She survived being hit by a car, fracturing her skull. She survived having her car crushed by a school bus. And yet, it was suffocation that got her in the end. 

She remembered the Japanese interment camps in Portland, OR -- when her friend was taken. She was an activist during the 1960s and 1970s directing medical treatment of injured protesters. She was a lifelong artist. She spent her later years working with the mentally infirm, helping many to become independent in their lives and leave care, become gainfully employed, and in some cases even become married -- much to the chagrin of her bosses. 

I loved her like family. She was one of a few people, if not the only one, with whom I had shared my thoughts unfiltered. She heard me without judgement, and spoke freely and frankly. She understood me like no others did. When others saw a misfit troublemaker who refused to go to school, she saw independence and intelligence. As corny as it is, she believed in me when I could not.

It hurts so bad that you died the way you did. I'm so sorry Susie. I wish I could have helped you. I wish I would have known. I wish you hadn't suffered so. It was a cruel death that such a kind and caring soul did not deserve.

I refuse to let myself be numb to your death, like I have with so much else in my life. I will grieve you proper, and continue to show you that I was worth your attention.

You seemed to believe that this life was not the only one we lived. While I don't believe it myself, if such a thing was true then surely you would be one deserving of moving to the next step in life. I can now understand why people cling to things like the afterlife, because it's so difficult to let people go.

I will cherish the art you gave me until the day I too die.

I love you. I'll miss you. Thank you so much for showing me how to be a human being again. Thank you affecting me so much that I weep openly for you.

Goodbye Susie. ~1940 - 2013.

You listen to my moans to figure out what feels good, and you love to hear them. You welcome my soft moans and subtle facial expressions. You like to pay attention to my every movement to determine the techniques that yield certain responses and you keep them in mind.

But then you get completely and utterly lost in my pussy. In french-kissing my pussy. In tongue-fucking the opening of my cunt. In feeling my sweet warmth against your mouth. You close your eyes and savor the moment.

You spread me open even further because you know there's much more in the folds of my pussy waiting to be caressed with your mouth, sucked, pleasured. 

While your hands are at it, eagerly spreading me open and vigorously licking the entrance of my cunt, you decide to insert your fingers all the way into my pussy and pump me deeply. You know it drives me wild.

You feel your face getting tired, but you don't stop.

I'm the juiciest, tastiest, best thing you've had today. And you've been waiting for ages to feel my legs thrashing, toes curling.

But you could care less about making me orgasm. In fact, you hope to god I never orgasm so you can stay down there forever.

I had several chances to talk to you later that night because you kept walking by me, seemingly purposefully. I hope that you noticed that I was avoiding talking to you like the plague because you were extremely rude and judgmental toward someone that was trying to talk to you, out of platonic interests of all reasons. I also would *not* want to put up with your pseudo-intellectual assumptions about people dressed nicely at night clubs, especially since *you're* out clubbing yourself, making you a gigantic hypocrite.

And what the fuck was that conservative Republican Christian assumption about? Seriously. Why is it that you'd assume that? I don't even have anything to say about that besides you thinking that you're above what *mainstream* partiers do and that anyone who likes what other people like must be a bunch of conservative Christian robots.

I have always put this down the the various mental health issues I've had to deal with over the years, and just not knowing myself due to this.

But I think I just realised the reason for all the strangeness, and weird off-the-cuff comments, and happy persona I try to emanate. 

Its all so no one knows that I am a delicate, hurt, sensitive person, who has been shit on from a height, multiple times, and it has felt like a sickening punch to the stomach each and every time. But even on my bad days, when I am angry or upset, and it is visible, I never show that little girl that is crying in a corner, that all she wants is a hug and a little kiss and told, 'its ok, c'mon we'll pick you up.'

Thats why I hide behind the strange behaviour. The wacky behaviour. 

If I don't, then all I will be is a little defenceless child, who doesn't have anything to hold her up. And who the fuck would ever interact with someone like that?

I am a woman who has been on both sides of the weight scale.  After having been overweight most of my life, I found myself underweight.  I suffer from an eating disorder.

I have heard everything from 'lay off the gravy' to 'eat a cheeseburger'.  For a person suffering from a distorted self-image, those comments can be incredibly damaging.

For every person that told me I needed to lose weight, there are just as many telling me now that I need to gain weight.  I'm imperfect.  Either accept that or move on.  I have enough trouble accepting my imperfections without hearing about them from others.  I'm tired of decades of trying to live up to some unattainable level of beauty.  Beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder.  I regret trying to become beautiful to those who have hurt me when I've forever been beautiful to the people that love me.

For those people out there that can look in the mirror and love what they see, I envy you.  I admire you.  Confidence is beautiful.  Confidence is sexy.  For those of you that say 'real women have curves' or 'nothing tastes as good as skinny feels', that is not confidence.  That is arrogance.  Don't feign confidence by belittling others.

I started writing and it just kind of all came out. Not really a rant, kind of just need to share that I know this with someone. In case you don't gather the info from the story, my sister does not know that I ran into her post. 
Forgive me in advace if the formatting is weird or whatever. Also for grammar and spelling, I'm on my phone and it's 6 am. 


Backstory:
19 year old female
I graduated class of 2012 and at the time I knew I'd never be able to afford college. I can't get loans because my parents have poor credit and can't co-sign. Can't get financial aid because my father makes too much money. So naturally I was looking into joining the military. Specifically the Navy. At the time I was with my boyfriend of almost two years.
 Because of past issues, I had problems with my parents. Not angsty teen ""I fucking hate my parents"" problems, like actual issues with them. My sister had the same issues, so she of all people understood my want and need to move out of my father's house. Around the time I was graduating sis found out she was pregnant. With her being 3 years my senior, living in a two bedroom apartment that she couldn't afford with her jobless SO, we decided that it would be a win win situation for me to move in. 
NOTE! I'm a good kid! I don't do drugs, I didn't drink (at all, at the time, and rarely now) and i got good grades (graduated with honors) had a job and money saved for a car. So, moving in was a mature decision that we talked about thoroughly!
Fast forward three months and I'm going though the worst time of my life. Boyfriend left me, job sucks, people I work with suck, I'm incredibly angry ALL THE TIME. Very hard to live with. We finally argue about the way I'm treating her, and I promise to try and do better, which I did. 
Fast forward to January-ish. I'm still in a bad place, sleeping around and messing around with a few guys, but generally better. Actually seeing friends and talking to people other than my coworkers. 
Fast forward again to March!
I'm actually happy at this point in my life! Still hate my job, but I'm thinking about joining the military (thinking air force this time), because I'm sick of working fast food for 7.70 an hour, and I want an actual career! 
I talk to a friend that just graduated from her Air Force A school. I'm motivated, excited, and nervous because this is a HUGE decision!

 Long story short, I go to talk to a recruiter, she's not in (she's NEVER in) so I talk to the Navy guys instead. Literally a week later I've signed an 8 year contract with the Navy (4 years active, 4 years reserves. The shortest contract you can sign) and have my assigned rate (job). I'm extremely pleased with my decision, and am expecting my family to be proud of me! 
I call my mom up, and tell her. She says, ""oh, okay."" 
My sister, who gave birth in Feb. Is pretending to be happy for me, but I can tell she's been talking to my mom about it, and isn't really pleased. 
My mom and I have a huge fight about it, then my sister and i fight about it as well. Her main argument being I didn't put enough thought into this decision. (Keep in mind that I was considering joining the Navy before, and had a quite a few hours of Navy related research under my belt. Also, at the time, AF tuition assistance was being cut) She's also using her brand new baby girl to guilt trip me, Saying that I'll never get to see her because I'll be so far away, etc. So, I'm completely baffled at this point. The only people that are happy for me are my father and his wife. 

TL;DR: Joined Navy after a week of chatting with a recruiter, sister doesn't like it, we fight, we make up. 


So my sister and I make up, everything is mostly fine and dandy. Then I was browsing Reddit last month and I noticed a username that was familiar. So, naturally, I decided to stalk a little and found out that it was my sister. No big deal, mostly pictures of my niece and normal comments. 

Well then I noticed she'd posted on r/offmychest. I know she's been having some problems with her boyfriend, and she's emotional because she just gave birth about 4 months ago, plus she's naturally dramatic. So I decided to peek, kind of getting that ""I'm reading her diary"" feeling while doing so, expecting to see a rant about her very unmotivated baby-daddy boyfriend. 

Boy, was I wrong. 
It was all about me and how my decision was completely childish and how I'm making the biggest mistake of my life. And. It. Was. Mean. I quote: ""She's so angsty, it's almost funny. Except then I picture her crying while her drill sergeant screams in her face because SHE'S A GIANT WUSSY. Which would be funny also, if it wasn't permanent.""

I'm so hurt by this. Even though I discovered it about a month ago, I get this sick feeling when I think about it. Which I do often because it bothers me so much. I'm joining the military for many reasons,
1.) I want my niece to be proud of me! I want to be someone for her to look up to! Not some uneducated fast food worker! I KNOW I will miss out on a part of her life, but at least they are years where she won't remember me anyway because she's too young!
2.) I want to be a college graduate, and this is my only option. So I'm taking it. This will be the hardest experience of my life, but I AM up to the challenge. 
3.) I've always wanted to travel, and this is a great way to do it! Sure, I might not have a lot of time to see things while I'm in port, but I plan on saving quite a bit of money for traveling the globe when my years are up. The Navy has many was to help you save!


She thinks: "" You are only looking at the positive side of everything, and completely ignoring the negatives. If there is a way to take it back, do it before those negatives bite you in the ass, because when they do there will be no way out, and you'll be all alone somewhere far away from home.""
I do see the negatives, I really really do. The positives just really outweigh them. 

There are so many more reasons, but above all, I don't want to struggle like my parents did. Like my mom still does. Like my sister is starting to.

I want to get this off my chest: All of Dzhokhar's friends and family portray him as an angel, but he wasn't.

When she got out of the store, someone had put a note on her car that said: ""handicapped? I don't think so"".  She came home in tears.  Fuck you very much, note writer.  This woman had almost every bone in her body broken, and a hole ripped in her heart, from a nasty car collision.

A single mum with kids whom their dad has abandoned. When times are tough, there are financial institutions and charities that will bend over backwards to help them.

Anyone else a single dad? I have 3 kids. 2 live with me, my boys. My eldest is autistic. Their mum ran off with their sister, my daughter, when she was 6 months old and I haven't seen her in so long. Child support can't track her down and supposedly doesn't work or claim benefits given no federal agency has her details. I am a student, completing my degree in teaching. Had to quit my career as an IT manager because I cannot raise an autistic son by myself working the long hours my career demanded. I had to choose between my career or my boys. I chose my boys.

So I'm on unemployment benefits. My car has died and I need to get another. I applied for a few loans only to be rejected for all of them. Really odd as I haven't been rejected in the past, even when unemployed. Then I discover that a year ago, the ex tried to claim a joint loan of $25k under her and I AFTER WE SEPERATED. This destroyed my credit as where I live (Australia), those rejections get listed as a ""check"" on my account and all the mainstream banks don't like those. So the credit agency tells me to remove them, I need to get an affadavit, file a police report and a few other things.

In the meantime, I go to charities to help me out. I live in a rural area with no public transport. I have to WALK everywhere. My feet are covered in blisters because I can't afford decent walking shoes as something always pops up for my kids. Dental bills, school excursions, therapy costs, etc. Do you know what my local charity said? They can't help me because I could easily get work. Bull-FUCKING-shit. I told them that while it is true, the only work I can get is out in the city, 80 minutes away and my autistic son keeps falling sick and until I can sort all that out, I can't get a job as I end up taking a few days off a fortnight to care for him. Then a single mum walks in with her kids, shows HER pension card (I did too mind you) and was immediately given a food hamper, a leg of ham, clothes for her two girls and a gift card for the local supermarket. Meanwhile I've got my youngest in the pram, it's 30 fucking degrees outside and have to walk back to my house which is 45 minutes away and my feet are now in pain.

I'm so sick of this bullshit. This area has great support if you're a single mum. The council provides for you. THey will pay for daycare so you can have a day out, they will also pay for that day out. They have a community bus to transport them around. But when I called up looking for the same help, I was told there was no services in place for single dads but they were currently investigating it. Then when I turned up to a single-parent-support group they had, I was asked to leave because the mums all felt uncomfortable even though I was just sitting and playing with all the kids there, along with my 3yo whom was crying because he didn't want to leave.

This is fucking bullshit. Charity won't help me because I'm a dad. Banks won't help me because my credit has been ruined by a vindictive ex but while I work on fixing it, which'll take ages, and in the meantime my feet fucking hurt covered in blisters and my youngest son isn't allowed to participate in the single-mum stuff because I have a penis and thus, am threatening.

I'm going to go drink for a bit...

EDIT: My angels. I don't have any pictures of my daughter beyond her being 6 months old :'(

Raised many concerns with the council in a letter I sent yesterday and currently looking into establishing a single-dad support group as it turns out my area has quite a few of them. Also joined a Mens Shed too and while they are full of older guys, they made me feel comfortable and I'm learning new skills =D

I'm tired of this ""sex sells"" culture. I am a male college student and it seems that I should be the demographic to appeal to all this pointless nudity, but I am just tired of it. Rarely does nudity serves a purpose in a film other than to make a quick buck. I just watched Flight (2012) and what is the first thing the movie starts off with? A closeup on a girl's breasts. And then pan out to... more breasts, and then pan out to her full naked figure. I want to watch a movie about a plane crash, a pilot's dilemma and the reception just like the trailer promised me, not some porno.

I get it if the movie needs it for its setting: Say, a medical situation happens, or it's in the past and clothing was worn differently, but these days most movies have some ""well.. we don't have anymore plot so BOOBS!"" And of course, when I bring this up, the majority of people I discuss this with either say ""you're just a prudish American"" or ""nudity is AWESOMMEEE, MOAR!"" I'm not religious, I wasn't raised in a family that shunned nudity or anything like that, I'm just tired of it being thrown in my face when I want to watch something completely different. There is a time for nudity and a time not for it. 

**Good Sense of Nudity:**

The Shawshank Redemption (Prison, 1947)

Starship Troopers (Co-gender integration in military)

**Bad Sense of Nudity:**

Flight (Why...?)

Wanted (Why...?)

I am also extremely proud of my crazy, coarse, unruly hair. It is extremely curly and frizzy and voluminous and yes, that is my real color.

So in order to be accepted by the majority of the gay community, one must denounce all attraction to the opposite sex (despite some genuine attractions), just to part of some community and receive some support.

Seems like a serious load of bullshit to me. Part of me can understand the history of it... with strictly gay people feeling pressure to conform, or leaving their gay partners for the opposite sex to cash on in broader societal acceptance. But come the fuck on! Is this really where we are in 2013? A strong subsection of the gay population are made to feel like pariahs unless they falsely 'wrench' themselves over to one side of the population? It's pathetic and embarrassing.

Now, this has little effect on my internal sense of identity, as being gay/queer/whatever cannot be totally reliant on societal acceptance, or one is in for an especially bad time. But I can't believe how simplistic, patronizing, hate-filled, derisive this perspective is. And yes, I recognize that just because someone is gay they are not suddenly above pathetic judgemental, totally irrational perspectives, but I guess I still find it shocking.

Hopefully this is just a blip on the long line of increasing queer/gay inclusion, but I wish the dialogue and guiding ideas were less simplistic and straight-up-stupid. I could go on and on with examples, but don't want to ruin my day dredging up stupid pointless brain-less injustices.

I drive a lifted off-road SUV; we're not talking bro-dozer diesel truck big or anything, but it certainly isn't stock.  I was on my way home and driving through my neighborhood with a Mini trying his best to fit up my tail pipe.  People regularly speed along this particular road despite it often being infested with joggers, kids on bikes, skateboarders, etc.  It's like driving through a level of *Paperboy* some days.

Just as I came even with a parked SUV my eye caught a flash of movement; a small but brightly colored ball just bounced out into the road.  Without even thinking I did my best to push my brake pedal through the firewall, as the front of my car dipped under braking I saw a kid who was maybe 7 or 8 run out into the road after his ball.  He froze.  I froze.  Time froze.  And then the car stopped.  It was over in a split second and the kid was running back into the house as if the fires of hell itself were licking at his heels.  I was vaguely aware of screeching rubber from somewhere else.

I pulled over and got out to collect myself.  The kid's dad, face drained of all color, came over to talk to me.  He thanked me profusely and said that his son was about to be grounded for the rest of his natural life.  He thanked me for paying attention.  He thanked me for driving the limit when other drivers speed.  He thanked me again and again and shook my hand.  The dad made it clear that he had taught his son not to run into the road - and that the kid was about to get another lesson (from the sound of it, this lesson would be hard to forget).  The dad then told me that the tailgating Mini nearly rear-ended me when I jammed on the brakes.

""Yeah?  Well fuck that guy.  He can suck on my trailer hitch, I've seen him speed through the neighborhood and that's what he gets for tailgating me.""

Dad agreed.

I'd like to think that it was my amazing ninja-like reflexes that saved that kid's life today, but it was luck.  It was luck that I ended up in front of that Mini instead of behind it.  It was luck that I had *just barely* enough time to stop.  It was luck that I caught that flash of movement out of the corner of my eye.  

It was a perfect textbook case of Driver's Ed hyperbole brought to life - and at the end of the day the only reason that kid was able to live long enough to be grounded instead of being scraped off the pavement with a spatula is *luck*.

I've been playing it over and over in my mind since it happened and I just felt the need to get it outside of myself, to put this out into the world so I can finally fall asleep.

I was in college at the time studying Law and bought a scratch card at a store in campus along with some groceries. I put it in my pocket and forgot about it until the next day. I scratched it without any hope but I was stunned to find 3 Â£200k numbers in there. I contacted the store who got me in touch with the relevant people and within a week I had the money in my bank account.

Now, my single biggest regret is telling my family about that money. My original plan was to put it in an investment bond and carry on with my education, and use that money to buy a house. I told my dad, who in turn told everyone we knew, my uncles, distant relatives, his friends, literally everyone. 

I come from a poor family and my dad is a somewhat failed businessman. He guilt trapped me into starting a small supermarket kind of shop with the money. At first I hesitated but he started throwing fits, crying in front of me, telling me how I don't care about family and value money over them. Me, being 19 at the time, thought he'd do what's best for me and decided to do as he said. Spent Â£100k opening a massive grocery store. 

It started making a loss and didn't break even until after a year when again he told me that it was going so well (when we had barely just broke even) that we needed another branch. I gave him the money and within 6 months I found out that he was taking money from the store to gamble which is why it was doing so bad. I got extremely stressed and couldn't focus on education anymore so I dropped out of college to manage the stores, the second one was doing particularly badly.

I had no business experience, all of the employees were my dad's friends and against me (which I didn't know at the time) and small steps led to the store being foreclosed, me being in Â£20k debt including the lottery money gone, and attempting suicide.

It didn't work and I got a small apartment with a job at the local chippie. Lost my job because of severe depression, couldn't pay rent anymore and the council took a month to set me up in a house and during that time I was living on the street, begging for food. 

I just recently applied back to law school and got a part time job at an estate agents.

Roughly 8 out of 9 murders of black people are committed by black people.

You always were an early bird. I was sitting right next to you and dad was sitting on the other side. My brother was trying to catch a small nap on the hospital bed behind me - the one that the hospital said we could use since you didn't have much time left. It was nice of them to make the room private - they were all extremely kind.

I've told one person about this, but none in my family - before you passed, I could see one of your eyes - the one on my side, not my dad's - slowly opening. I watched you as this happened and it scared me. I saw you draw your last true breath of life and your eye - it was glued on me. I knew instantly that you had gone.

My sister-in-law frantically woke my brother up and I got up from my seat and ran to my dad and hugged him tight with tears in my eyes. I felt like a child - I'm 20 years old and I felt like a child who just had a bad dream, who just saw a ghost.

My brother tried to convince us that you hadn't passed for a minute or so, but the air your body was letting out was not evidence of you living, but a natural reaction the body does on it's own as it shuts down one last time.

When the doctor came in to confirm you had passed, I stopped crying. Instead, I became the pillar of strength for my father, who bawled harder than I feel like I ever have. I hugged him tight and let him cry into my shirt as I stared at you. My brother and sister-in-law were crying on the other side of the room. My cousin was near them, doing the same. Nobody was looking at you. I couldn't help it.

You lost color so fast. By the time we left, a half an hour later or so, you had grown so cold too. It was weird to think that you had been so warm earlier and it was unsettling to see you so still. It occurs to me that there are probably very few people, if anyone, who knows how to be truly still. I feel like it is only something the dead can master, after a life of constantly moving.

A life of constantly moving is what you showed me when I was growing up. I remember my powerhouse mom who never seemed to rest, managed to do everything and more, and was invincible.  Sometimes I got embarrassed because I wanted you to be a 'normal' mom, but truthfully you were a lot better than other moms I had seen. Even after you couldn't work anymore, you still pushed yourself to the limit.

I always thought I would see you live until you were in your 90s or something. Cancer has a way of changing things. Changing life expectancy, changing what you normally would see.  Over the course of four years, I watched my powerhouse mom turn into a very fragile woman, who needed someone to care for her. You couldn't care for us anymore and I know you hated it, but within this last year you just decided to accept it. 

I think that's how I knew you were going - my endlessly stubborn mother accepted her limitations and stopped trying to go above and beyond them.

I spoke at your services. Anyone who wasn't crying started after I began to speak. I didn't have a speech or any big words to say, but I let everyone know that I was proud of you - because I am. You fought against cancer as best as you could, but even the greatest warriors have to rest eventually.

Dad tried to speak, but her couldn't and I told him it was okay. My sister-in-law spoke, but truthfully by the time she was speaking, I was just focusing on not dropping the tissue box I was holding for everyone.

I'm doing my best to be strong for everyone. Everyone keeps telling me that if I need anything, to just ask. I don't stumble around them. I smile.

It's only when I'm alone that I feel like I need something, someone. When it's quiet, I think about you and miss you. It's so unreal that someone who I loved with all of my heart that I saw most days of my 20 years of life is just... gone. It's strange knowing that I will never see you just being alive, doing anything - walking around, sitting, **breathing**. I will never hear your true voice again - all I have is the voice recorded on my phone in a video of us driving down the highway at nighttime, while I tried to catch a video of what looked like a meteor falling from the sky. You laughed in the video. I can't see you in it, but I have that laugh and that voice.

I'm going to get a tattoo of your handwriting soon. You didn't agree with it, but you still wrote down something for me when I told you about the idea. I never got to say this to you, but in response to you saying ""You know, if you weren't born with it, it probably shouldn't be on your body"" - I have two prominent scars on my face and I think they add character. If one day I lose all of my possessions, especially those linking me to you, at least I'll have this. I'll always have some part of you. That means the world to me.

I miss your voice. I miss your smile. I miss your strength. I miss your warmth.

Let's cut to the chase. My dad was in the army and befriended a man. I'll call him Will. Will was also a teacher at my middle school. He and my dad were good buddies, so I was around him a lot. He had kids around my age, and he also shared my love of music. When I started middle school, he and my dad began to visit more. My parents had a small cabin that we would camp at during the summer. Will and his kids were at our cabin a lot, and we fished and played in the water. It was all innocent fun. I was around 11 or 12 at the time. 

One weekend, my parents had to go back to the city home for whatever reason. They trusted Will and his kids to use the cabin for the night. I decided I wanted to stay one more night, and have Will take me home in the morning. After my parents left, Will asked me to sit on his lap. I didn't think anything of it, I had no idea what his intentions were. He grabbed my shoulders and began to massage me, telling me ""I have too much tension."" My dad always (innocently) rubbed my back, so again I didn't think it was anything weird. Then I remember him grabbing me a certain way and spreading my legs. 

I felt his hand under me, as if he was adjusting his penis. (We were fully clothed.) I do remember him feeling ""hard"" and it touching my privates. He lined his dick up with my vagina and pushed through the clothing. He never penetrated me, thank goodness. But it felt like he wanted to. He thrust his pelvis a few times while squeezing my shoulders. His son (around my age) went outside and slept in the truck, as if he knew. I remember jumping off of his lap and going to lay down in bed. I didn't know what to think, but it freaked me out. He left me alone, and that was that.

He continued to be my teacher for the next few years and we just acted like all was well. He would come by to ask to take me with his kids to go swimming, and I always tried to make an excuse not to. He never did anything physical again, and I haven't been around him since middle school. My parents divorced, and so everything had changed. 

My dad was always one to act like his friends could do no wrong. He is a very hard man to get along with. I never had the heart to tell my mother because she had been sexually abused throughout her entire childhood. She hated the topic. I also felt somehow, as if it was my fault. *I know it wasn't now.* 

I've suffer from borderline personality disorder, my dad and I rarely speak. My mother is not doing well health wise, and I'm struggling just to keep my head on straight. But this very instance, it has eaten at me for years. The fact that Will had a daughter, and he was a teacher. It happened around 13-14 years ago and I've always felt like I just shouldn't tell. I didn't want to go through something bad. I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, but now that I'm grown I know that his actions were very wrong. 

What are my options? Thanks for reading.

He was trying to dig his car out of snow on the side of the road and another car slid out and struck him in the chest at 45mph, killing him instantly. This man was my brother, someone who would loan me money in a pinch and knew that I would get him back. I have so many of my life experiences involving his presence that even now its hard to believe he is gone. He was my competition in life, in that we would constantly push ourselves to out-do each other. 

After he died I had to be a statue for his girlfriend who watched it happen and had to go through being with him while he was dieing. Everyone expected me to be shattered by his death, and when I stood firm, everyone used me as support. ""If I can handle this like I am than they can work through it too"". But the issue with that is: I didn't let myself grieve in an attempt to be strong for everyone else. When everything finally settled down and his girlfriend moved on to other guys and I was left by myself I tried to commit suicide. I ended up being hospitalized for a little while and was released with some antidepressant meds and told I'll be ok. For the most part I was. But for so long before and after my hospitalization, I wished I could trade my life for his. Wished with all that I had emotionally and mentally.

Its now almost 3 years since his death and my life has changed dramatically. I'm married now, for over a year. I have a 1 year old daughter who I love more than I could have possibly imagined loving someone. But I think about him at least once a week. Wondering what he would have thought of my family now. Wishing I could share my stories of what I've gone through without him. 

But heres the kicker, the part that I need to get off my chest, and something I only recently realized. I wouldn't trade my life for his anymore. I can no longer justify giving up what I have now so that he could be alive today, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. It makes me feel selfish that if magically given the choice, I would say:""No, I want him to stay dead so I can live my life."" I cant justify leaving my daughter without a father now. Or my wife without a husband to support her. But at the same time that I feel this way, I am happy that I now have a life I consider worth living. That I am excited to get home from work to hear my daughter squeal at my existence in her life.

This is what I need to get off my chest. I cant say it to anyone involved because they wouldn't understand. But I can say it to the anonymity of the internet because I feel I need to say it.

On my 7th birthday, he slapped the shit out of me because I didn't want one of the guests drawing on my book. He's always an asshole to me, especially when it's jut me and mum and him. He ruined yet another birthday by screaming at me for not wanting to do as he wanted. I didn't want to sit with him and told him so. He walked off for an hour then as soon as we got in the car he just started screaming at me how I was ungrateful, didn't want my family around, ""oh yeah what do **you** need space for?"", I would've let him sit with me if he was rich, etc. I don't want that disgusting, sweaty, fat, ignorant fuckwit anywhere near me. Not sure if other redditors are familiar with what I'm on about but I've noticed he has what my mum calls a ""diabetes smell"" and it's sort of sweet in a gross way. I didn't want that sweaty fat pig near me breathing heavily all over my ice cream and baby-talking to me like he always does. he's a condescending prick who thinks that anything less than worshiping him for his ability to drive a car means we hate him and if someone needs the toilet while he's in there he'll rant about it ""being a conspiracy, these fucking women don't want a man to have a good shit"". well, I'm sorry, but you aren't the only one paying rent you fat slob, I pay rent too and that means I get to use the toilet as well. if it takes you half an hour to do a shit, you need to either hurry up or take a laxative. I'm fucking terrified of him, I have to tread on eggshells because the slightest thing sets him off screaming. He hasn't hit me in about 6 years, the last time he did he hit me around the head with the pole we use to stop anyone opening the sliding door in the kitchen, the pole I was trying to protect myself with. He's either completely uninvolved in my life or involves himself to the point where asking him to back off makes him act like The Incredible Hulk.

I have little privacy around here. I'm not allowed to have a lock on my bedroom door, I have to keep my computer in the dining area at the end of the hall so everyone can see what I'm doing, I can't get rid of my dad long enough to buy underwear and he has this thing about having a good long look in my shopping cart after buying groceries, especially if there's pads in there. I am an adult at 19 but he refuses to treat me as anything but a spoiled kid who needs a good beating to make her compliant. If I am sick in the car, he screams at me which makes the pain in my stomach worse which makes him scream more. He knows that I am ill, has to take me to many specialist appointments and has seen me in pain lots of times but still insists that I am ""lazy"" and tells me ""hurry up and get better, go get a job and get out my fucking house"" (""his"" house that the government owns). He sits watching tv all day and accuses me of being lazy even though he doesn't do shit and it's mostly left to me and my mother to do the housework. All he does is sweat and fart on everything and leaves crumbs everywhere then accuse us of doing nothing. 

I want to have friends but I don't want them to meet the disgusting fat fuck and see what an asshole he is to me. When we're in public, he has to make a show of telling me off for EVERYTHING. That's right, ACTUALLY TELLING OFF HIS ADULT CHILD LIKE A KID just so he can tell himself that everyone thinks he's a great father and not a fucking creepy idiot. He smacked me pretty much from the time I could walk and talk to 13 or 14. It really hurt. I'm also expected, at 19, not to ""wander off"" as if I am a young child at the zoo. I only got to go out on my own last year and he ripped my handbag apart trying to pull it off me so I had to go home. He treats my mother like a servant. She has to do everything for him, including making sure he eats every 3 hours because he's probably too lazy to make his own food and actually takes his food to him because he refuses to eat at the table like an adult. He wants to sit in his armchair with a tray on his lap and sit there eating his food like a toddler in a high chair. He always refers to us as ""that one up there"" when he's angry at us (depending which one of us he's decided to get angry at) and if my mother tries to point out I did nothing wrong he starts verbally abusing her and saying ""oh stop fucking defending her, never mind that she is your child, stop defending her"", etc. I feel more like a verbal punching bag for him to take out his insecurities on than i do his daughter and I'm sure my mother feels more like his slave than his wife.

1356791322.0,119,self.offmychest,15mi4h,Something that has been with me since I was fifteen.,UsifRenegade,153,34,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15mi4h/something_that_has_been_with_me_since_i_was/,"This may be long; but It's something that has been with me for a long time.

It all began when I was about fifteen or so; just shortly after I had broken up with my then girlfriend. We were dating for about a year or so, and I genuinely thought we had something special; that is until I found out that it was basically just a status thing and she just wanted people to know who she was, and that she was biding her, getting closer to a friend of mine.

The break up hurt, not cause of us ending, but I suppose the sheer honesty that came from her... Her never really caring, her actual intentions, and just that it was merely for reputation purposes. 

That same day after school, I sat at the local malls food court, just wondering what I did wrong, why it had to be me, you know, the usual fifteen year old dramas; that is, until I was approached by a young lady wearing a long sleeved shirt in the middle of summer (In Australia).

Her name was *Jessica*.

She approached me, asking me why the long face? As I looked up, I just saw this beautiful girl, with dark brown eyes, smiling at me, with genuine interest in my story, and in me. I proceeded to tell her the situation, and the lead up to it all; and with every line I spoke, she absorbed.

We talked, well rather I talked and she listened for the better half of an hour, until everything was said, at which point she just said to me *""at least you're still alive, at least you still have family. You have your whole life ahead of you, what does it matter if she used you? Better it was only a year, rather than four""*

At this point, I was shocked that I didn't see it more broad, and was just sitting there looking at this girl smiling at me, with what felt like the warmest smile I've ever been given.

We continued to talk for another hour, getting to know each other, and who we were, where we went to school, and what not. By now it was nearly 6 PM, at which point she told me she had to go home. Before leaving she grabbed my mobile and quickly put her number in and told me to call her later that night, at about 11 PM.


As she left, I couldn't help but smile, not for the fact I got to talk to such a beautiful girl, but rather the fact that someone, a stranger took their time to listen to me, smile for me, and just genuinely care for me.

11 PM rolled by, and I proceeded to contact her; by now I just wanted to know everything about her, about the person that got to know me. We talked, and talked some more; getting to know her and life, present and past. This kept going on till about 7 AM; till we both realised we needed to be at school in an hour.

I sat all day in school just thinking about her, and her smile... That beautiful smile that was given to me, a complete stranger at the time, just from the bottom of her heart. I was excited to just talk to her at this point, literally having *butterflies* in my stomach thinking about it all.

This kept up for months on end, getting to know each other, inside and out; sadly, to the point I didn't see. I soon found out she was extremely abused as a child and even present day, with her father being a drinker and taking out his anger on her, whilst her mother just sat by, pretending it never happened, basically blocking it all out.

I was also approached later on, after people saw just hanging out, telling me *""you're hanging out with Jessica? Dude I heard she's a slut... Basically gets with any guy that tells her he loves her""*

I wont deny that she fell for this excuse, I will only say she just wanted someone to love her, whole heartedly; but at age fifteen, there is only one thing on a guys mind, and they'll do most anything to get it.

Though this rumours existed about her; I didn't care... I kind of promised myself I'll be that guy to love her, make sure no one ever hurts her again. Two more months passed, and the abusive stayed constant with her father, even getting to the point where she would be asleep and he would just walk in and start hitting her, forcing her to run.

There would be times where I would get phone calls at 3 AM telling me to come out if I could, and to meet at a local bridge near our old primary school, and I almost always did. When I finally got there, I would see her sitting on the ledge, with her school bag on the floor (she still wanted to attend school, usually waiting till 8 AM for it to start).

We would sit there for hours, just looking up and talking about our dreams and ambitions; always hoping for the best. She would drop her usual random questions like *""you reckon will know each other in our mid twenties? Actually, we better""* , and even sometimes *""What you reckon we are going to do with our lives? Reckon there is more to life than all this?""*

I was just a kid; I didn't know how to respond, so I just said as long as she had me, everything would be alright, and for the most part; that's all she wanted to hear, smiling back at me.

This continued for another month, till the abuse became more frequent, and much worse... That is until one day I receive a message saying 

*""Yousif, I'm sorry. I always told you I'd be strong and that I'd always be there for you... I lied. I just can't do this anymore, I'm sick of fighting when no one wants me to fight... I'm sick of putting on a fake smile when no one even notices.
I know I promised you we'd get through it all together, but I guess I'm going to go first. You were the first person to love me for who I am, and not want to use me for anything, and that meant the world to me.
Will see each other someday soon, I know it. I love you.""*


My heart dropped, and I immediately ran to her house, which took about thirty or so minutes... By the time I got there, no one was home and I had to climb up to her room, only to be too late. She was already pale, and lying on the floor... There was a suicide note written to her family, apologising for her not being the daughter they wanted, or being perfect in their eyes.

It burned me inside knowing, till her dying breath, she couldn't see it fit to hate her family for what they did to her, not even a bit. I took the note and ran, and continue running.

I found out a month later her family moved away after burying her, basically running from her memory the fucking ungrateful bastards. It was because of her I became happy for one single moment in my life, and it was because of her I try my best to help every single stranger that looks like they need it.

It was her that made me a better person, the person I am today... I miss her so fucking much, always going back to the bridge and just standing there... I always just think to myself I finally have an answer for her finally.

*I do remember you Jess... Even in my mid- twenties... You're the one constant in my life*.

I had to get it off my chest, because up until now, no one knows about her; not even my parents... It kind of fucked me up I suppose because now I just don't trust anyone any more because I feel like they'll leave me as well... And no one really measures up because she Is all I wanted, and nothing comes close to it.

Two years, first everything, huge part of my life. I cried, I will admit- and I do not cry easily. 

I took Sunday to pick myself up. Got my excellent circle of friends to come over and just laugh with me. The next day, those same friends went out on a 10 hour drinking session with me to make me feel better. I spent an inordinate amount of money and smoked more cigs than I thought I could handle as well as putting away at least 10 pints. Not 24 hours after breaking up, I made out with another girl. But none of these things are particularly badass.

Walking home from the bar, I see a girl trying desperately to hold up her drunken friend. I wait, delaying my friends for 45 minutes, to hold her up so her friend can get her home. I paid for my friends' taxis home (and we're all skint as fuck so that's a big deal). I made it into college the next day, to discover I had gotten a 70 on my last assignment- that's an A, where I'm from. I felt a bit deadly. 

On top of this, I'm being heralded as the King of Breakups. I am so not-bitter, so mature and so fucking normal about losing her compared to the rest of my friends that they're just flabbergasted. Sure, I hurt- but no bitterness. I walk away with only good memories and no unresolved conflicts. 

As the evening winds down I'm feeling a bit morose. It's hitting me- I'm alone. Then, who should message me, but the ex- saying she knows it's unfair, but she really misses me and blah blah blah.

Do I use this to convince her to get back with me? No.
Do I gloat, and say 'I told you so'? Not at all.
Do I ignore her, like I'd be perfectly entitled to do given that she broke it off two days ago and now wants comfort from me? NO. 

I sit there for a good half hour, telling her to feel better, giving her advice on how to stop from hurting so much, telling her that I know it's hard. I console the woman who dumped me not two days before. 

Now I know I won't be getting a Nobel peace prize, but I'd just like to stroke my own busted ego a bit; I'm a tolerant, patient and good-natured guy. I'm fucking holding my shit together while everything else goes to shit. Sure, I'm not laughing in the face of death or enduring any real hardship, but I'm fucking proud of me. I can hold my head up and say 'I am a good human being.'

Been coming across women lately who are overly concerned that their butt is ""too big"" when it is very proportional to the rest of them. Also, if you have a small waist and wide hips, that is also very attractive.

Some rear padding shows that you are well-fed and healthy. A good waist to hip ratio indicates that you are fertile and likely will have an easier time giving birth. Humans find anything that indicates health and/or fertility sexy for obvious reasons. 

Also, while I'm on the subject, a little bit of fat (and I do mean a *little* bit) around your middle is not as bad of a thing as the media would like you to think. It, too, indicates that a woman is well-fed and fertile.

You don't need to be super skinny, super muscular, super tall, or ""perfect"" to be attractive to the opposite sex! Stop being so damn worried! 

**EDIT**: FYI, I am female. This ""off my chest"" post came into being because I'm frustrated with other women who look how a woman should look, yet somehow find fault with the shape of their body.

**EDIT2**: It's interesting that I made this post to get this off my chest and people are getting irritated with me. If you're taking a general statement personally and it's upsetting you..... (you fill in the blank here). Lots more downvotes than I expected in the comments!

**EDIT3**: Why are people *still* attacking me? I don't get it. This post was meant to get something off my chest. You go ahead and look however it is you want to look and enjoy whatever body type you like, people. I'm not saying that women should have any particular shape or that men should like any particular shape.  My frustration is with **some select women** with a particular shape that is 100% normal for women to have. Some of these particular people hate their ""big butt"" or ""wide hips"" when in all reality, they look healthy and 100% fine. These particular women are not overweight or underweight (by nearly any standard), they are obsessing about something that they have no reason to worry over.",,False,,t5_2ranw,1360258946.0,,,True,t3_180bfr,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/180bfr/newsflash_guys_generally_like_some_junk_in_a/,

My grandfather in NY is in dire help and I am the only one in the family who will do something. However, I live in the Midwest and need some guidance. I am going to start solving this tomorrow morning by embarking on a road trip to upstate NY.
Here we go with the facts-
My grandpa (Papa) had his identity stolen last month. Starting two weeks ago some strange guys started showing up at his house, multiple times each day, demanding money. 
I have family in New York but they're doing jack shit to try and help him. They've called the police but they're no help either, dismissing the case immediately each request. 
I am 24 and temporarily living at home. My mother just informed me of this and I'm fucking livid. She's in tears, I'm damn close, seems that I'm going to have to be the one the steps up and makes something happen.

Here's what I bring to the plate:
I'm very intuitive and get shit done.
I'm charismatic.
I have some legal connections in Vermont.
I don't have a car.
I'm nearly broke.

So now comes the million dollar question- WTF do I do?? Please guide me through this as the Fellowship did with Frodo. 

Many thanks in advance. 

10am edit: thank you all so much for the advice. Here's my game plane for the day:
1. Call sprint and ask for another extension.
2. Call some of the numbers you guys posted.
3. Call my legal buddy in Vermont.

She makes my first ex look like a fucking angel.


You began asking me for advice, how I felt about the whole situation, and above all, to be honest.  I gave you what you asked for every single time.  And for what?  For you to have it go in one ear and out the other?  For you to stand there and refuse to acknowledge or absorb anything I say and instantly go in defense mode for this insane monster?
Sir, you asked me to be honest and you asked for help.  If you in fact just want someone to tell you want you want to hear, not what you need to hear, then don't talk to me anymore.  You're wasting both of our time.

Yes, I care about you dearly, you are like a brother to me - but I can't keep doing this.  I hate to give you an ultimatum, I really am doing everything in my power to avoid that from happening, you/she just make it sooooooo goddamn easy.

Let me break this down for you.  Here are the things you complain about:

* I have no money
* I'm depressed
* I hate my job
* My car sucks
* I don't have enough money for gas
* No one understands me
* I have no friends


Now let me tell you how she is NOT helping these things get better for you:

* I have no money 

You spend everything on her.  You refuse to cook, she refuses to cook, you insist on paying for BOTH your meals all the time.

* I'm depressed

Motherfucker, I am depressed too, but you know what DOESN'T HELP!?  Constantly being with someone who is just as depressed, if not more than you are, and on top of that, she's fucking crazy!  I keep fucking telling you, GO FIND HOBBIES.  DO SOMETHING WITH YOURSELF.  You need to eat better!  You need to start exercising!  FUCKING DO SOMETHING.  HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO FEEL BETTER, IF YOU DON'T FUCKING DO ANYTHING?!

* I hate my job

Every time you say this, I respond with ""Then go look for a new one.  You should have a long time ago.  They are taking advantage of you.  There tons of places downtown where you are more than qualified to work at and pay so much more and treat you like you're human.""
And you just brush me off with ""Yeah....yeah I should.  Maybe soon.""  Oh yeah, forgot to mention that SHE isn't saying any of this to you, which she should be if she really cared about you.

* My car sucks

Dude....you drive that thing like it's a tank.  Newsflash: IT'S NOT.  Not only do you treat your mode of transportation like crap, you aren't saving up any money to even buy a new car, cause oh, that's right, all of your money is going to fucking crazy vagina over there.

* I don't have enough money for gas

This.....this just angers me.  This is your daily routine, and you know I'm not exaggerating here.

1. Pick her up

2. Take her back to our place

3. Take her back to her place

4. End up back at our place

5. You take her back to her place.

Do you see the problem there?  Tell her to drive.  TELL HER TO USE THAT CAR AND DRIVE.  Or give you gas money, SOMETHING.  Or how about you just stop being dumb and plan your trips better, or stop fucking seeing each other all the goddamn time.  But seriously, above all, TELL HER TO FUCKING DRIVE HER CAR.  ""She's a bad driver"" is NOT a valid excuse.

* No one understands me

I can't ""understand"" you if you don't talk to me.  Your problem is you don't want to be wrong, and you know that's exactly what I'll do.  You are seriously fucking up man, at this point you need to man up and just fucking admit it.  It's not the world against you, it's all you.  It's all in your head.  You're just doing it to yourself.

* I have no friends

Excuse me.....says the guy who ditched on his friends flying in from another state to see him.  They were YOUR friends, NOT MINE.  I ended up entertaining them and hanging out with them all day and night while you ran off to be with your retarded girlfriend.  You're an asshole.  They came for you, and you say you don't have friends?  You're isolating yourself from everyone, no one knows where you are anymore cause you're always with her.  Open your fucking eyes.



Aside from the fact that she is a fucking lunatic, she is using the shit out of you.  You have not gained anything in that past year.  You have not grown as an adult and you haven't shown improvement in any aspects of your life, besides gaining a hole to stick your dick in.  She's not good people and she's turning you into a really shitty cousin and a really shitty friend.  I'm done trying to make things better man, I've tried and I've spent way too much effort and time into this, I'm fucking out.  If she's still in your life when she comes back from China you can be sure that I really will start treating her like she doesn't exist.  I'm not supporting this.  You can go right on ahead and keep digging your shit hole, be my guest.

I lost a child, and blamed my problems on that.  I drank because she died.  I stole the money to try and be happier, because we're all going to die.  I got sent to prison because I fucked up.  

I scared my children.  They didn't get to see me for a few months.  I made my wife understand how bad of a person I was.  My poor son screams whenever I leave thinking I might not come back.

I got out of prison, and couldn't find a job.  Still can't find a job for what it's worth.  So, I decided to go to college, and get a degree, online.  I started out doing really good, kicking ass and taking names.  Then I slowed down.  I wasn't motivated.  My wife was working, when I should be.  I promised her she would never need to work again before we lost our baby.

So, now, I'm the stay at home dad, and I hate it.  I hate doing laundry, I hate doing dishes.  Every day I need to make breakfast lunch and dinner for a family of 5.  I'm vacuuming, and folding laundry, when I should be working, and providing more food, and more stability to our children.

My children suffer because of my lack of attention.  I get mad at the little things that I should be laughing at.  I notice I get mad.

But, I'm trying to get better.  I make an awesome dinner everyday.  I do the laundry, and dishes.

I'm trying to be a better person, and a better father.  It's just so hard, when you have so little.  When you've fucked up so much, it feels like it's impossible to come back from it.

A scare here and there. This time it's different for me. More real. I knew it was a bad idea for you to go on the pill and I was totally against it. We made plans for this. We've set alarms and written reminder notes on the coffee pot so you don't forget to take it every morning. One day you and I both forgot and it just so happened to be a day we had incredible sex before I left for work. That was 3 weeks ago. I don't blame you and I don't blame myself. It happens. If you kick the door down screaming in praise that you're pregnant then I will act exactly as I did upon hearing the news the first time. I will leap from our bed and hold you tight. Our son is 2 and a half now. He has no one to play with but his mommy and daddy. Maybe he needs a new brother or sister. Maybe he needs one now. Maybe we should wait. Either way, what ever happens, I'm ready. I'm ready to accept what will happen. If you're not, great. If you are then that's great too. We can do it. It'll be easier now that we know what to expect. You'll have to quit your job more than likely but that's okay. We can do it. If you're not pregnant then it will just give us more time to prepare for when we do want another baby. Either way, sweet pea, I love you. You're my best friend and I'll always be right next to you. I'm going to sleep now. The world may change when I open my eyes next or it may stay the same. I know things will be okay either way because I know you're with me and I know you're mine. Good night and sweet dreams. 

EDIT: Morning has come (afternoon for me). It would appear the worry was not necessary. The test was negative. My wife woke up feeling ill and I, with only 2 hours of sleep, questioned her about it. Her response was, ""I haven't told you yet so, no, I'm not pregnant."" I hadn't absolutely expected her to be but I was starting to get used to the idea again. We will be trying again. August 2014 will be a deadline. We don't want our children to be too far apart. Thank you all for reading and showing support as you all have. It's an incredible thing to wake up to.

But I just feel like a worthless, poor pile of shit when they do things like this. I know I shouldn't, I just don't know why. I know they are not appreciating that meal as much as I would, I love food almost as much as I love her. The most expensive meal I've ever been to didn't even scrape $200 for the whole table. 

She is pissed because I may have to go to a state school next year because I simply can't afford to not have a full ride out of state. She jut doesn't understand that I want to get a graduate degree VERY badly and simply cannot afford the debt because I have to pay for every single penny of college all by myself. Idk wtf. 


Idk. I just self-loathe for hours whenever they do rich people shit like that. Really minor issues but hey, its a throwaway and I just felt like writing it down. 

I already feel better. 

EDIT: She is calling in 30 mins to describe the experience. Shit. I just get so many different emotions. I feel like a shitty boyfriend.

I helped you with your work and you with mine. We went on hikes together and played video games together and got drunk together. We were buddies. We were friends.

I spent countless nights staying up into the early hours of the morning, listening to you go on and on about your existential crises. And you know what? I was happy to do so, because that's what friends do. I prided myself in believing for a while that I was maybe even your *best* friend -- the only one you told such deep secrets to.

Man, did I misjudge you.

We were with our other friends and coworkers one night. We'd all had a fun time out on the town. Everyone was hugging goodnight. I stepped toward you for a quick embrace, but you turned away.

I was more than a little confused.

When I asked you later what had happened -- had I offended you somehow? -- you told me, in your blunt way, that you don't like hugging fat people. You think we feel disgusting to touch, and you just won't do it.

How could you not understand why I was angry when you came into work the next day? How could you come over to me, sit on the edge of my desk, and start talking about your latest problem like nothing was wrong? Like you hadn't just told me that, despite the fact that you're more than willing to hang out with me and talk my ear off until four o'clock in the morning, you won't extend to me the simple, universal courtesy of friendly human affection?

I wanted to rail at you. ""Like you're a model of physical perfection?"" I would have yelled. ""You're a fucking scarecrow! You think I would enjoy feeling your bony angles poking into me? That's not why friends hug! That's not why people touch! It's not only the models of the world who're worthy of human contact! How dare you imply that because I'm overweight, I'm not good enough to deserve a simple hug?!""

I wanted to say all that, to spit it right in your face. But I couldn't let you see how you'd broken me. I couldn't let you hear my voice crack or see the unshed tears in my eyes.

The worst part? Even after I'd regained control over my shock and my anger, I couldn't call you on it. Because it's okay to hate fat people. We're gross slobs who bring it upon ourselves. My hypothyroidism and my severe depression are no longer valid excuses in popular American opinion for my obesity. ""I'm depressed, too,"" I'm sure you would point out, ""and look at me -- *I'm* skinny.""

Well, then. Case closed. I am officially unworthy.

After that ""incident,"" we were no longer close. I think it took you a few months and more than a few hints for you to finally realize that. You're incredibly self-involved and socially awkward, and you probably had absolutely no idea that your words had offended me. In fact, you may still wonder, these several years later, what happened between us.

Do you realize the sort of lasting effect your words had on me? No, of course you don't. Well, let me tell you: Now, whenever someone more physically fit than I am touches or hugs me, I cringe, knowing that there's every chance they're gritting their teeth in a valiant effort to overcome their disgust at the feel of my body.

Your talent for obliviousness does not make what you did okay. So: Fuck you. And fuck the fat haters of this world. Just because you don't wear your personal struggles on your body, as I'm forced to, doesn't mean you're a better person than I am.

I met the girl the first day I moved into my dorm. She turned out to by one of my roommates best friend. I immediately found her attractive, but I would soon find out that she was a lesbian and had a girlfriend at the time. As the semester rolled on, her and her girlfriend would break up but remain friends because they were living together so its been kind of weird when we all hang out. 

One night we all got pretty drunk, the girl I am attracted to, let's call her Carmen, can notice that her ex-girlfriend is flirting with my best friend (a male. I know this shit is fucking weird). So she says to me, ""if they hook up, you and me are hooking up too."" 

Thats exactly what happened. Me and her are making out on my bed and she absolutely destroys my neck and chest with hickeys. We didn't go all the way because I knew she was drunk and I didn't want to be that guy who took her v-card like that. 

The next day she starts texting me saying ""this is really weird for me because I've never been attracted to a guy, but I had a really good time with you last night. We should do it again."" 

So we start a little fling. We're hooking up behind everyones back in secrecy. If her ex found out, she would probably kill both of us.

I had a huge crush on him but I was super shy and didn't really talk to him. He used to make farting noises whenever this one kid would sit down. He did this because the kid (who had serious emotional issues) would completely flip out. Mark thought this was hilarious and continued to do it until one day the other kid beat him up and they both got in trouble.

This wasn't the first time that Mark was in trouble, he had quite the reputation. 

One day in that class we had a test. I could feel while I was taking the test that I had to pass gas but I tried really hard to hold it in. Can you imagine, being in 8th grade and farting during a test? It would be catastrophic! Social suicide! I had to get up and turn in my paper. I squeezed my cheeks together hoping, praying that the gas would just stay put until I could run to the bathroom. As I sat back down in my seat it just came out. 

But it didn't sound like a normal fart. It seriously sounded like a dang zerbert. I guess it's because I was trying so hard to not fart.

Mark swore that I actually farted. The teacher asked me in front of the entire class if I did.

I checked and what I saw was a horrible big bruise with hematoma on her back. ""My mom kicked me on my back and made me eat soap"". It was so heartbreaking. Such a small frame to endure that physical pain. I had to follow protocols and reported it. Part of me is terrified of where social services/welfare will take this kid.

Edit: Thank you so much for the overwhelming support. I feel SO much better now!!

The school principal told me if I don't report it, the State could revoke my credentials. And I had to do what was being dictated by protocols. They called 911 right away and the child was taken to the hospital because bruising was just really bad in the back.

Now, I know 90% of us are nice, well rounded, intelligent, kind individuals. If you are part of that group, you are excused from the following. To the rest of you:

Thank you for making what has the potential to be one of the best websites on the internet a fucking haven for some of the worst people and ideas on the web. There is a certain, vocal group of you that are absolutely some of the worst people I have ever met.

First and for most, the most annoying fucking thing about Reddit is the superiority complex. Everybody on this website thinks they are so fucking smart, and that it is such a burden to be so wise. This bleeds through in the most disgusting way possible: the Eugenics circlejerk. Every time the topic of genetic disorders, crime, or even simply somebody ""not that intelligent""(Honey Boo Boo?) comes up, somebody posts something along the lines of ""man, we should really sterilize these people so they can't reproduce"". Every other week it seems somebody is posting a manifesto about the need for social Darwinism and how ""idiots"" shouldn't be allowed to reproduce, or how doctors shouldn't save people's lives, or how the movie Idiocracy is sooooo accurate, etc etc. 

It's fucking pathetic. First of all, to all these people who are so pro Eugenics, do you seriously think you are so smart? Honestly? Because 90% of you would have your balls cut off by the state if what you preached were ever put into practise. The human race has gotten along just fine thus far with all these ""idiots"", and we will continue to do well. Get the fuck off your high horse. Secondly, **Do you have no empathy**? When you preach for these things like Eugenics, you are preaching for a higher power to step in and take away one of the most basic rights of life, the right to reproduce. These people that would be effected by Eugenics are your friends, your relatives, your neighbors, your countrymen, human beings. They have feelings and emotions and faults, just like all of us. Third, eugenics is just straight up impractical. How do you determine who is taken away? Stephen Hawking would never have been allowed to be born if Reddit got it's way.

Another thing that really irritates me about this website is the overt racism. A huge part of Reddit just straight up hates black people. Never mind the literally hundreds of studies that show that the leading factor in crime is socioeconomics, not race. Never mind people like Martin Luthor King, Neil Degrasse Tyson, and hundreds of other brilliant visionaries,  nope, black people are bad. A common argument I see against this is ""I don't hate black people, I hate niggers"". That is arguably the most ignorant fucking statement that has ever been made, and shows just how engrained the doublethink is for some people; that statement boils down to ""Hey, I'm okay with black people, so long as they act white"".

Even worse than the racism is the blatant homophobia. Reddit has a weird relationship with gays; it absolutely loves them when their rights are in conflict with religion, but otherwise, Reddit hates and fears homosexuals. Jokes about homosexuals get dropped daily, not to mention the more overt discrimination. And guys, we get it. Reposts are annoying as fuck. But saying ""OP is a fag"" is neither funny nor original, or even effective. Leave that shit on 4chan where it belongs. 

Reddit has a weird love hate relationship with women. On one hand, Reddit has a serious problem with misogyny. As SRS, r/feminism, 2x, and thousands of users have pointed out, Reddit is a terribly sexist place, making literally thousands of sexist comments a day. On the other hand, Reddit seems to have a never ending stock of ""nice guys"" who bitch and moan so much about how unfair it is that women don't love them for just existing, and how all women are bitches that only like assholes, etc. Ultimately, Reddit is like a 13 year old boy who can't stop cracking ""make me a sandwich"" jokes, and then wonders why women avoid him. 

Ultimately, what pisses me off most about Reddit is that Reddit is full of nerds. I don't mean nerd in the ""I like obscure video games and lack social skills and play DnD"" context. I mean that Reddit is full of a bunch of butthurt neckbeards (sorry for playing into the stereotype). We all know these guys. They grew up in middle class homes, are somewhat smart and technically adept, but absolutely lack anything resembling social skills, so they sit in their basement and bitch and moan about how hard their life is, while simultaneously wallowing in their own narcissism, going on about how awesome they are and how everybody else is so dumb and how it's totally bullshit that everything doesn't just fall into their lap. If this sounds like you, new flash: **The world doesn't fucking work like that**. If you want anything good to happen to you, you have to go get it. Nobody will do it for you. The rest of us figured that out by the end of high school, when the fuck are you going to grow up and get with the program?

To anybody who is reading this and gets mad, offended, or defensive: take a good, hard look at yourself. Because I am talking about you. This website has so much potential to be fucking amazing. But it is absolutely over run with these people. The neckbeard stereotype is alive and well on Reddit, and it really, really hurts the kind of discussions we can have on here.

one of the people is obviously addicted to attention, hence *everything* including the political-erotica stage shows but the whole 'female who dresses like a drag queen' thing wasn't supposed to be serious, it only became serious when she started posting things about how terrible the plight of trans* people is - and yes it'd be great if this was about awareness of other peoples problems but it's not, it's co-opting for attention.  
  
now this other person has decided they're trans* which is fine, i'm not even going to ask when you gave up on all your old opinions that gender is a false construct and began whole heartedly accepting the notion there are two distinct genders; i'm not even that bothered how you square not feeling like your actual gender but instead identifying with your actual gender - what really annoys me is that despite the fact that literally no one on the entire planet has ever even considered the fact she might be a female to female transsexual suddenly it's a reason we're all supposed to be giving her sympathy and helping her establish herself in the face of a life lived knowing as a trans* person she's among the most likely to suffer a violent attack, etc, etc, etc...

Im a 21 year old white male college student, and GENUINELY a nice guy, someone who puts everyone ahead of them when it comes to everything mainly their happiness. I probably care too much about emotions in general which has led up to this point, I put everyone else ahead of myself all the time, if its a choice between helping someone make just a part of their day easier/better or something else 9/10 times i would be the one to jump up and help. Im majoring in computer security with 2 years of helpdesk experience in my belt, so alot of people know me as the guy that can fix computers, and im fine with being that guy, because knowing that I am helping someone with something they dont understand at all fills me with pride, because I know my small act of kindness can be the best moment of that persons day when suddenly all the panic fades from their face and their computer is restored to how it was. 

Now, if every girl ive ever wanted to be with didnt abuse the hell out of my genorisity I might not be typing this up right now, but that is the case, I am contacted by people I sometimes havent even spoken to in months for them to be like : ""Heyyyyy my computer isnt working you wanna come over? Oh by the way how have you been in (Insert Distance of time since we last spoke here)?"" 

Ive never had many successful relationships, and that probably contributes me to wanting nothing more then the affection of someone who cares for me as much as I care for them. And yet I am continuously told, ""You are such a nice guy, you are gonna end up with someone great one day."" Fuck you and whoever came up with that bullshit. I have been being told the same shit for years now, and to everyone who has ever said it? DIE IN A FIRE.

Seriously. I know a lot of people will downvote/disagree with me, but I am very happy with my decision. (I'm 25 now)

I haven't told anyone in my personal life this because it seems like a stigma to bear (being a virgin at 23). I had been in the ballpark before, but had never wanted to actually have sex with any of the men (boys) I ended up in bed with, so I always kept it to the first 3 ""bases"". Eventually, when I reached 20-21, I was always too embarrassed to tell anyone I was a virgin, so I never let it get that far. Sometimes I broke up with people very early into the 'relationship' because I didn't want to tell them that I was a virgin.

I realize now that I was young and naive, and that someone who really cared for me would likely be very accepting of this, but I was self-conscious about it and I eventually stopped trying to date (like a whirpool, sucking me in deeper and deeper).

I ended up going on a trip overseas where I stayed with one of my best friends who lived in that country. I met her roommate, an older guy, who shared a lot of my interests (biology) and was genuinely interested in me. That night we all when out and had drinks, and when we got back to their flat he asked me to come to bed with him. 

Because I was far from home and away from pretty much everyone I knew, I said yes. I told him I was a virgin. And he didn't care.

It was a great night. I was with someone I found attractive, but someone that I wasn't worried on impressing or keeping around. He listened to me and made me feel wanted. The next day my friend and I left to travel elsewhere, and he kissed me goodbye and that's the last time I saw him or had meaningful contact with him. And that's totally, completely okay with me. 

I needed to get this off my chest because I'm not embarrassed about it. Now I am capable of getting into meaningful relationships without worrying about my ""V card"". I definitely don't do one-night stands because I am now confident enough to know that that's not the type of sexual encounter I want. But I made the right decision for me and I am happy with it. :)

EDIT: I should add that though I wasn't having sex before, I was always prepared. I always carry condoms just in case (I think all sexually active girls should!).

It was an incredibly awkward conversation, I didn't really know quite what to say. At first I was like 'Huh, how about that?' because somewhere in the back in my head I somehow didn't think it was mine, but then I realised she wouldn't be calling me to tell me if it wasn't, and then I also realised there was no way it wasn't mine because of the circumstances of conception.

I'm a little scared, because I really don't want it. I mean, I want it but this is really bad timing for me and I also feel like a dick for thinking that. I am hoping that she gets rid of it, but I don't want to tell her what to do with it. Basically I'm being selfish because if she does have it then I would have to give up my life as I know it, I'm broke at the moment but just enjoying travelling life and having fun, this would kill that. If she did keep it I'd have to move states, I might feel pressured to be with her even though I have no desire for that, I'd have to cancel future plans; all of them.

The worst thing is there is nothing I can really do about this. We didn't use protection because she was on the pill and we had no reason to worry about STDs.

Fuck.

**UPDATE:** For everyone saying get a paternity test because she might be trying to trick me into raising someone else's kid, or might have slept with someone else and doesn't realise it's theirs: I respect that this may happen from time to time but I can assure you that this is not the case; without going into too much detail I have been around her 24/7 for the past three months so it's impossible for her to have slept with anyone else.

For everyone saying that she was or could have been lying about being on the pill: I don't believe this, I actually saw her take it a couple of times. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately for our race) pregnancy can and does happen even if you're taking precautions and using the contraceptive properly.

For everyone saying I should have been smarter and wrapped my shit, and because I didn't I should own up to my mistake: Agreed, and that's what I will be doing should she decide to keep it. This would basically mean moving to the other side of the country and giving up a lot of my life as I know it but I'm not totally unwilling to do that.

Got a message from her last night, I won't post it here but it basically she is feeling pretty guilty about putting me in the situation (ignoring that I put her in this situation just as much as she did me) and 'always said I would never get another abortion, but now it's happening and I've involved you it is different' plus some other stuff.

So basically I think abortion is probably the most likely thing at the moment. I'll have to call her after her doctor's appointment and discuss it all with her.

This summer, I (19) moved in with my boyfriend (20) because I had the opportunity to work at the chemistry lab at my university essentially running the place, and his house is less than a 30 minute drive away (as opposed to two hours home). I thought it was a good idea considering that it's nearly impossible to get a job in my hometown and that this opportunity would look great on a resume. My boyfriend's parents love me and refuse to take any money from me to contribute towards bills, meaning the only expenses I really have are gas and lunch money. 

I called my grandmother/former guardian to tell her of my plans before the summer started. Her reaction caught me off guard, as she told me that I'm an adult now and can make my own decisions. My father however, was not as pleased. After I told him, he refused to talk to me for weeks and I didn't see him for two months afterwards. 

I came home two days ago for the first time after moving in for a coming home/4th of July party (my cousin came home safely after being in the USMC for 5 years). My father had apparently told my family of me living with my boyfriend, and a good handful of people didn't approve either. The entire day was spent with my father, stepmom, favorite aunt and uncle, a cousin or two, and my two infant twin siblings. Everyone else either came over to say hi, then left immediately and avoided me, or simply didn't say anything at all.

Here's why I'm pissed off.

Out of the 6 of us female cousins (including myself), four of them have had a child by the time they were 18. There is only one cousin and I who haven't gotten pregnant. Every time a teenage cousin got pregnant, they were waited on by hand and foot, given financial help, had huge baby showers thrown for them, and were given a place to stay if they needed it. Only one of the four cousins actually knows who the baby's father is, and he no longer has custody after smoking meth in the car with the baby. 

One of the cousins that had a child is pregnant with her second child, the father being her drug dealer (she's addicted to pain pills and heroin). Her first child is 3 years old and currently in the process of being adopted by my aunt and uncle because my cousin is incapable of caring for her. Before she was a year old, my cousin took her to a party and used her as an ash tray. And now she's pregnant with a son, due any day now, and my family couldn't be happier. 

So why is it okay that all my cousins are becoming young mothers with no job, no education, no roof over their head, and no baby daddy around, but it's not okay for me to live with my committed boyfriend to have a good job? My boyfriend works 50 hours a week at a reliable job, takes college classes online, has a nice car, and pays for all of his bills himself. He's an all-around good guy which my family is obviously overlooking. I'm sure my family would be okay with my cousins living with their baby daddies, right? It really makes no sense for them to criticize me for putting myself in a good situation and doing something that would help me find a job after I graduate. 

tl;dr - Family criticizes me for living with my boyfriend to have a great job to put on my resume, but completely supports my pregnant teen cousins who have no education, job, money, or baby daddy in the picture.

I had a girlfriend who was a year younger than me, with a physically abusive father, and verbally abusive mother. I met her at the age of 15, and she was 14. Her mother would call her useless, stupid, whore, anything along those lines. Her father would hit her and she'd show up with scratches, bruises, etc. She had issues dealing with this, and when I go to know her, I found out about it. I always did my best to be able to protect her from them, but she refused to call the police or CPS, and I didn't want to violate her wishes. Whenever they would kick her out I would take her in and do my best to comfort her. There were a few suicide attempts by overdose, but I made every attempt at keeping her alive. Over the 3 years we were together, she gradually started getting better. When I told her I was going to be gone for 3 months to go to basic training, she told me she wouldn't be able to last that long without me. I made a vow to buy her a plane ticket to come live with me the day I graduated, and that she would never have to worry about them again. But, after 4 weeks of being away, her letters to me were getting more concerning until they stopped coming altogether. I asked my instructor what I could do to go home and check on her. I was told the only way I could was if I was suicidal. So I told him I was suicidal, and within 1 week I was discharged and sent home. When I got back, I had learned that I was already too late, and she had already passed on. This is still a very touchy topic for me to discuss, and I still have problems facing that reality. I haven't talked with my family nor friends about this, and when I talked to a therapist about it they sent me to a psychiatric ward. I'd like to maintain some anonymity here for this reason, so things like my name, location, and her name I'm not going to disclose. Thanks.

Thanks closest friends.,Throwawayinthebay5,123,17,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ik00i/unattractive_thanks_closest_friends/,"Alright. If I keep this inside anymore, I think that Iâm going to burst. I donât get much chances to be bitter, so excuse me if this sort of over the top. 

Friends, do you think it was incredibly wise to tell me that Iâm unattractive? Really? Do you think that was a great idea? I suppose it is better than lying, but still. I try so hard to be presentable and I take care of myself as much as I can. You really thought that it wouldnât hurt my feelings that my close group of friends canât even give me a compliment. To make it worst, call me unattractive upon that. 

Itâs not like I already have self-esteem issues that you guys already touched upon. Heck, I donât even feel like Iâm in my own body half of the time. Yet, you are going to say that you canât even look at me when I talk because you canât âlook at someone you donât find attractiveâ. That hurt, and that put all my fears into motion that I canât even sleep now. 

My friends are good people, donât get me wrong. They are supportive and friendly when I need them.  Yet, that hurt more than they could even imagine. 

Iâm a 5â5â, 95 lbs guy with the lowest self-esteem. I can barely stand most days because Iâm so tired. I almost completely lack a sex drive. So, occasionally, I like to be informed that I exist. I like to dress nice, get my hair cut, do something to make me feel like I have a physical body.  Yet, nope. Not even my closest friends can give me a pat on the back, and then expect me to look for it from strangers. âOh youâll find someone that will like you for you.â Ha no. You don't even think that.  

So whatever ladies and dudes. Iâll pretend to be completely okay with this. That is sort of what you guys come to expect from me. You guys are good friends, but you need to rethink how I feel for once. Because you know, surprise, just because Iâm smiling doesnât mean Iâm happy.
 
Iâm sorry if this is shallow. I just couldnât keep it inside anymore.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years. Recently we found out she has terminal cancer. Because money is tight, and she lost her job because she couldn't work, her doctor has been helping her out as much as possible. He supposedly got her into a trial in a very well known place, and even raised money for her to get there. I couldn't have been happier. I asked a few times about specific details, but she said she doesn't know much, since it was so last minute (which I can understand). She was always very vague, which kind of threw me off, but I didn't think anything of it because I was watching her become a vegetable in front of my eyes. 

She wasn't allowed to use her cell phone in there (which I know is true), and yesterday I got an e-mail from her saying that she needed to talk to me on the phone, and that she got special permission to talk to me. I got the call, and she said there was some sort of hepatitis scare there, and everyone had to get tested for all sorts of things. She came back positive for both herpes 1 and 2. We BOTH got tested before we ever got together, and neither of us had anything. She said that I should go get tested. I just found it really odd, so I decided to look at the headers of the e-mail to find out where they are coming from. 

They are coming from a state (state B) a few states away from where she should be (state A), and they're also coming from her cell phone (from what I can gather). 

Shortly before all this happened, she told me about her best friend who was in love with her. Also, that he was moving out of state because of a job offer. That state, from what I remember, is state B. I WILL say that I could be completely off on where he lives now, and want to believe it is state B.

I'm at a loss now. I have no idea what to do to confirm it. I know I won't get an answer from her if I directly ask, so that isn't an option. I can also see the facility *possibly* using a proxy, which would bring back an out of state IP. As far as the phone e-mails go, she could be sneaking it (she has before when she was in the hospital). 

I don't want to confront her, because if she is there, then I look like the biggest asshole for not trusting her. But pieces aren't adding up. Also, if I confront her and she is there, she might lose hope on living. The one person she wants in life thinks she is cheating, instead of being at a clinical trial. I love her to pieces, but I'm so lost right now.

I honestly do not âgetâ American sentiment about 9/11.

Yes, it was the first time in a long ass time since there was an attack on the American homefront.

Yes, a lot of people, innocent people, died. 

Yes, it was a tragedy.

I do genuinely feel bad for the people died, and especially for those who lost loved ones. My heart goes out to them and I wish that it had never happened. Losing a family member unexpectedly is one of the worst things that someone can go through.

That being said, I donât think that what has been done in response is in any way justifiable. Requisitioning freedom and âgood old fashioned American idealsâ onto people, and electing a dumbfuck president TWICEâ¦ itâs just. Itâs honestly something that sounds too Hollywood to be real. There are always those action movies where the heroâs wife or some shit is killed, and so he swears vengeance and racks up a pretty hefty body count.

Thatâs sort of what this seems like to me. Except this is real. Would you justify those actions if it really happened? 

The âwar on terrorâ has turned us (as a whole) into a hateful shithole of xenophobic, islamaphobic, hyper patriotic assholes. Itâs so useless. Nobody really wins in this situation. Itâs stupid. A lot of people outright REFUSE to listen to me if I say that I think 9/11 is silly, or too often used as justification for stupid bullshit. Like, honestly?

I realize that for the people who lost family, it is still a very real and present thing. But people make fucking Holocaust jokes all the time, and they donât get shit for it. OH SAY ONE THING ABOUT 9/11 AND YOUâRE A GODDAMN SOCIAL PARIAH. Thatâs not to say that Holocaust jokes are âalrightâ or anything like that. But it can still be a painful memory for some people.

Honestly. 

All this does is show people that by killing a few Americans on the homefront you can destabilize the entire social structure of the country. I realize that asking people not to care is a bit silly, butâ¦ itâs what would solve this issue? Getting famous and striking fear is what this is all about. Yes, the media should cover it. No, we shouldnât still be angry about it as a whole 12 years later. A national tragedy for us is a daily occurrence for people in other countries.

I donât think that people âwaking the hell upâ is an issue, either. I think that justâ¦ caring is an issue. People in this country think weâre the fucking center of the universe. I meanâ¦ weâre not. What the hell makes American life so much more valuable than any other life? Itâs not. âAll men are created equalâ we shout blindly to the heavens ignoring the fact that there are still oppressed people in this country due entirely to people adding âwhiteâ into that phrase in their tiny little brains.

This reverence for our military is just bullshit. Memorial day was recently, and I canât help but remember all of the âIF YOU LOVE YOUR FREEDOM THANK A VET.â Thatâs absolute bullshit. There are no Revolutionary War veterans around to thank. Hell, all I can remember our military doing recently is go die trying to push US ideals onto other countries or issue bitch-slaps to the enemies of our allies. Iâm not saying they donât do a tough job. They really do. But thatâs exactly what it is, a job. And one they get paid pretty handsomely to do. Yeah, itâs a shitty job that I donât want to do but if I recall correctively (this is said entirely in jest because I know for a fact) a lot of people sign up happily to do it (except for those poor people who got drafted into Vietnam, ANOTHER CROCK OF SHIT). 

Thanks for doing it so I donât get drafted, but youâre not a fucking âheroâ for shooting at people far less equipped to defend themselves than you are. You sure as fuck havenât done a damn thing to secure MY freedom. We have such a ludicrously over inflated military, none of our personal freedoms are in danger. The only time in recent history that I can think of them (the US military) actually protecting our freedom was after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

There is no reason for us to still function in such a way. Such a fucking racist and hateful way. And if youâre still reading this, good on you for sticking with my horrible rant. Honestly, Iâm impressed. I just cannot believe how fucking stupid some people are, and how willing to justify the suffering and murder of more than 3000 innocent people because some American lives were lost. Just because some jackasses in turbans flew a pair of airplanes into three thousand people doesnât mean that we, as a country, get to go on some ridiculous revenge quest. We destroy innocent peopleâs homes and lives over some âcatastrophe.â Itâs just not okay.

Fine with me I'm a patient man, she needs help and can take as long as she needs. Well the father offers no help to the poor girl and the mother doesn't speak English it seems. So being the kind person I am I start to help her out. Well as soon as I do this the father flips the fuck out. ""What are you doing to my daughter, leave her alone she can handle it herself!"" Obviously she couldn't. So I backed off. I get my food and then proceed to get my drink when I bump into this girl again struggling to get a drink and handle her food at the same time, her father nowhere to be found. So I try to help her out again filling her cup with whatever she wants to drink. Out of nowhere here come her father. ""Get your hands off my daughter or I'm going to call the police, I was about to help her"" but he was sitting down already eating, I checked to see where he was before helping her this time. So I back off get my drink and go sit down. A few mins later the manager comes up to me and starts saying I have to leave. I ask why and he tells me there was a complaint against me. I proceed to tell the manager what really happened and I guess that guy was able to hear me and he shot up faster than a virgin in a strip club. ""That's not what happened this man was trying to touch my daughter and take things from her"" me being 5'11"" pushing 225lbs and build like a tank Am clearly bigger than this little fuck. So I get up and get in his face, ""I was just trying to help your daughter who needed help, your dumbass was nowhere to help your own child and I felt bad because she obviously doesn't have parents that look after her and help her when she needs it"" I am going off in the guy for a couple mins while the manager is standing there making sure it doesn't go past arguing. This dumbass shuts the hell up, not one word comes out of his mouth after I'm done. And the manager decides I was just trying to help and this father was just being a dick and trying to make me look bad. Well in the end they got kicked out of the restraunt which made me feel horrible because the girl had to leave also an I got my meal for free (refunded full price) for being a good person and trying to help someone in need. Before the family left I told the manager that I wanted to pay for the child's meal so she had what she wanted to eat when she left, but he said that he would get her a meal for free also. 
There really are good people in this world that just want to help. And that father just pissed me off enough for me to step in to help his child, the one he should have been helping instead of me.

But holy crap I am the happiest that I have ever been. Initially I was attracted to his personality and kindness, but not his weight. However, he's been dead-set on losing the weight, and he actually lost quite a bit before we met. Anyway, today we were just working out together, encouraging each other with so much cheesiness, (ex. Me: ""Lifting 90 lbs? That's hot, babe."" Him: ""yeah, that's my girl; work it!""). So cheesy. And yet I love every moment. And holy crap after working out, I got in the shower and I just felt so FRESH and so ALIVE. I love that I can both wear makeup and not wear makeup and he loves me all the same. I love dressing up for him and I love bumming around in sweats and a hoodie with him. He makes me laugh, makes me feel special. He doesn't mind when I get my awkward moments; he just takes all of my quirks in stride and embraces them. 

Also, he was not the world's best kisser when we first met, but I dunno, now he kisses me and little fireworks go off in my head. I just wish he would hold me around the waist more. My waist is quite small and it's one of my personal favorite assets. Hot damn, this man! 

Oh, and his family is just wonderful. We all watched the Superbowl together at his parent's place (before we made the relationship official). We had so much fun! His little sisters think I walk on water; they've told me, ""you are &lt;boyfriend's name here&gt;'s best and coolest girlfriend, ever!"" 

And the best part?! He told me he wants to cook for me on Valentine's Day. I mean what man does something so sweet?! GUYS I AM IN LOVE.

All the students in front of you are straight-A honors students, cream of the crop. Your class is optional, we're here because we want(ed) to be here. We're not idiots, we're not delinquents, we're fully capable of learning more than what we can read in the textbook.

So when everyone in the class scores 70% or below on a test, which do you think is more likely?
  1. All the students, simultaneously, blew off studying/note taking and bombed due to lack of preparation
  2. The test was poorly written, poorly graded, or tested material not covered in class.

Yes, it's the latter. Yes, you conceded such. So why the **fuck** would you maintain the grades and then assign ""note checks"" for every following quiz?

Every single one of us agrees that you are, without contest, the worst teacher we have ever had. Yes, this is your first year teaching government, but that's not an excuse. When you're unsure of how to teach something, a catch-all-""excuse"" isn't saying ""This is my first time teaching government, so bear with me."" **We know you suck, it doesn't help that you affirm it every day by proclaiming it.**

Plus, your ultra-conservative, religious-laced agenda isn't exactly a solid teaching foundation, either. It's hard to take you seriously when your justification for governmental authority is ""The Bible says so"" then touting the Pilgrims as paragons of free expression and orderly society. I'm extremely glad that my previous social study teacher (who alas, was kicked from the school for theological differences) actually taught a philosophical baseline when discussing matters of government, like Descartes' Social Contract, otherwise I'd be walking away from this class as an anarchist!

When anyone speaks up in class, they're ""troublemakers."" One kid pointed out a major factual error in the textbook (a claim that the Founding Fathers were all Christians. Cripes) and was slapped down as a smartalec. I pointed out an insultingly blatant bit of propaganda (summary of political parties, listed Democrats as ""supporters of higher taxes... welfare programs... abortion and pornograhy."" Wut) and nearly got detention for it.

You don't know what the **fuck** you're talking about, and it's obvious. Half the class is *us* giving a summary of what the book says with zero extra input from you, the teacher. Then, you assign an annoyingly large homework load (doable, but disproportionate) and grade it like a college thesis (didn't use MLA for a chapter outline? Half off!).

What's worst is that you lose homework. I'm marked down for several missing assignments that I know I've turned in - I had to email them to my school account to print them out (weird access standards), and I only emailed myself while in the computer lab. You don't accept *anything* that's not a paper copy, and even then you lose paper copies. The last time I found the sheet you lost, you accused me of slipping it into the pile!

I love school. I love learning, I love being challenged. But you, sir, are a mockery and a sham who has no right to call himself a teacher. On graduation day, when I thank my math, science, and english teachers for helping me expand my mind and give me valuable knowledge, I'll just walk up to you and flip the bird.

Holy shit, when things fucking work they work. Holyyy shit. I
m fucking giddy right now with happiness. My head might explode. I swear it might.

**Edit:** Thanks for all the support yall. To clear things up. 
I got my GED The day after I dropped out of highschool, that was the plan all along(Another bullshit story with the reason why I dropped out and such.) And my girlfriend and I won't be breaking up anytime soon. I'm planning on proposing next week. 

**EDIT 2:** So some people are asking why I dropped out. Basically because my Parents, My mother and Step dad, had to move from the East Coast to Arizona to support their bad habits. My mother was a drug addict who couldn't hold a job, and my step dad was a manager of professional athletic venues. They both lost their jobs back east and we moved out west during the middle of my freshmen year, out west it would have been the last week of school. I lost all credit for my year, accelerated classes and all. I tried to make up the credits but just got sick of being far ahead of school and stuck in remedial classes so I left. 

During the time I was in school though my Step dad passed away, and my mother disappeared, leaving me homeless and parentless so I was placed in CPS custody and now since I've got my GED I have college paid for, which I am starting in the Winter.

Hope this clears things up. Thank you, everyone for your support. It's fucking awesome.

1354163565.0,106,self.offmychest,13z6i4,A question my mother asked me the other day about my pregnancy gave me insight into the reason behind her treatment of my brother. ,Moshpity,114,8,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/13z6i4/a_question_my_mother_asked_me_the_other_day_about/,"My mom said ""Can I ask you something? Why are you so happy to have a boy? Usually moms get excited about girls""

A little back story, my husband and I are expecting our second child. During our first pregnancy (a girl) my mom always wanted to see any baby clothes I bought, so on thanksgiving I mentioned to her that we'd bought some outfits for our expected son, thinking she'd want to see them. After I showed her the outfits she asked the question above. Now I admit after two years of dresses and ruffles we are excited to buy ""little man clothes"" but not any more excited than we were buying tutus and headbands for our firstborn. Newborn baby clothes are adorable and we're excited to be expecting our second child, just as we were with our first.

Honestly, my mother asks me a lot of weird and rude questions, like after my daughter was born she asked me at least 50 times if I enjoyed being a mom because apparently I wasn't acting happy enough, if I'm able to have patience with my daughter because I had anger problems in my teens, why i hadnt lost all the baby weight at 16 weeks post-partum, etc. So her asking such an odd question did not throw me off much until I started wondering why she would think mothers are only happy about girls. When I was pregnant with my daughter she suddenly began texting me every day, which was odd considering we'd only talked two or three times a year for the previous 6 years. With this pregnancy she doesn't ask about anything and she just generally seems less excited, which doesn't bother me but after her question I started thinking about that too. 

I was her firstborn, then my brother, then my sister, so she also had a girl first, then a boy. When my brother was two she left him with his abusive father because ""it was the only way he'd let me leave""  according to her, even though she left my far more abusive father when I was 2 and disappeared so he couldn't find us. Anyway, after she left my brother and sister's father we didn't see our brother for 5 or 6 years. She knew where he was, but made no attempt to see him. My moms boyfriend finally pushed her to get visitation rights when my brother was 7 or 8 and we would pick him up every other weekend or less often if my mom didnt feel like making the hour drive, which happened a lot. When my brother was around 16 he got into drugs and started breaking into houses and was also stealing from us, not surprising considering his father abused him horribly and our mother treated him like an inconvenience. Shortly after he turned 18 my mother and her then husband seperated and we all went our separate ways, except our little sister who stayed with our mom. 

It was another 5 years before I could get in contact with my brother again and my mother refused to talk to him at first. Now she makes no effort to be in contact with him, even though he is off drugs and doing much better. She is constantly reposting ""I love my daughters"" pictures and things ""for my girls"" on facebook with no mention of my brother. Her questioning my excitement about having a son seems to be directly related to her indifference towards her own son, which has in turn made me see her treatment of my brother not so much as something that just kind of happened out of inaction but a genuine indifference towards him. All my life I've wondered how she could have lived with leaving him behind, but now im wondering how does she just not care about one male child while constantly declaring on facebook her love for her two female children? My sister is her mini me so that bond is understandable but my mother and I had a holidays and birthdays type of communication for years during and after my teens and we're still not close. Our relationship as it is now only exists because of my daughter. I guess it just bothers me to think that the reason she was able to leave him so easily is because she really didnt care that much.

I always feel special around her, she's really pretty and makes me feel just wonderful. So today I spent an hour on the phone for her. When I went to leave I said, ""could I ask you for a kiss on the cheek?"" she said, ""ok baby"" with a smile and did and I blushed really big. Then I said,""could I get a real kiss?"" and we kissed. It was short. She left after and said she'd call me. I feel fucking incredible. Like I just had my first kiss all over again. Just wanted to share.

A teacher in my hometown's school district was charged with Criminal Sexual Conduct. The local teachers are rallying around him and sending letters to the court in support of this Pedophile trying to lighten his sentence.

The family of the victim is trying to gain support for their son's case. Meanwhile, someone burns their garage down, and paints the letters YWP ITY on their front door. (You will pay, I told you?)

These were my teachers, and I know the family personally. This whole case makes me sick. I don't know what kind of community would stick up for a Pedophile, but I never thought mine would. This is a very small community, and this case has sent a shock-wave through it. This family does not deserve punishment for being victimized by some sick pervert.

In elementary school and in middle school.  What is worse is I'm a Hispanic male within an old-fashioned family where crying is cause for a beating from my dad because I am a male.  As if he needed another reason to give a beating.  I never told anyone about anything. I showed up at school with a smile on my face and tried at making new friends. Being underdeveloped, chubby, and blatantly from a lower income status only plummeted my chances to 0.  I once tried telling my counselor in middle school about being violated but he only thought I was trying to get attention. Highschool comes and I've grown and lost weight. Being extremely awkward and with a shy smile, I muster up some sort of luck  to make a few friends.  Here is the part where a girl...girls...come in and mess things up.  After a heart break I decide to go to a house party and drink my troubles away.  After this, I begin to drink and drink more. Show up to school drunk and then drink some more and go home drunk. It honestly got out of hand. I went too far where my grades plummeted and I literally failed every class in my sophomore year.  Extacy gives you a warm and loving feeling.  Nothing like I've ever felt before.  To my knowledge, my parents never hugged me.  Maybe when I was a baby. I'm hoping.  Whenever they come to pat me on the shoulder in rare moments, I flinch.  I'm so afraid of beatings I have done anything to avoid them.  The warm feelings inside my brain in such large amounts made me believe that was love.  That was in fact the true meaning of love.  So down into a worse spiral I go.  I drank to forget the past.  Then drank some more to forget the drinking.

one of those christranch reprogramming deals, utah. 

They used bounty hunters to kidnap/gather us for our folks, bang into your room at 3am and drag you away sort of thing.

They had this system for 'fixing' the kids.  take away all self expression.  no singing, no drawing, no references to anything from 'outside', no talking about anything that happened 'outside'... let people mingle, then set up everybody in a big ring and tear into whoever it was they wanted break this time.

They'd let the kids just go at them, throwing out every last nasty character flaw and insult they could come up with.  Doesn't sound so bad, maybe, but I guess you'd have to be there.

Nothing was out of bounds.  If the girl was priorly anorexic, or -anything else-, you can bet everybody knew that and had no problem yelling at her what was wrong with her when she was on the ground in a fetal position bawling her eyes out.

I refused to do it.  I got shouted down for offering support to the people they were picking on.  Even accused of thinking I was better than everybody else.

I wanted to scream at them, 'i'm not better than anybody except -you-!  I can't get close to anybody here because then I'm a LIABILITY to them, because they have to choose between wanting to hurt somebody they like and not getting punished themselves later then; if they don't know anything they can't be asked to hurt me to save themselves!'

In the times we were alone, I told everybody else to be strong and not give up or give in, that none of them were perfect but that nobody deserved this.  One of them said I was like the 'jew they burn first in the concentration camp movies'.  

They starved me.  denied me sleep for days, and any meaningful trustworthy companionship in non-animal form during the worst part of my entire life....

and looking back now, 12 years later, at the mess this made of me and trying to put myself back together from the impossible, inconceivable things I saw:  people kidnapped against their will, held against their will, hurting -each other- for praise from the people who kidnapped them.  Most of them needed no urging either, they just dug right the fuck in; because they were just happy it wasn't their day to be the person being lower than shit.

Looking back, I remember this wonderful dream I had where something came to me and said all the impossible things I couldn't say to all the people being tortured around me; to not be afraid, that somebody loves you; and I have to go someplace I'll be heard and say this:

Why didn't I do more?  
Why didn't I kick over a chair and scream, 'Why is this okay?!'

it'd have been worth it if they killed me.

I'm 31 now; and I've met a lot of wonderful people and I have, give or take, as good life as you can reasonably ask for, I think.  But even now, looking back, I...

I hate what i understand.  I hate that we're capable of what i saw there.  That we can be the people who ran that place, trafficking human misery for money and quasi-religious circle jerking...

but worst of all, I hate that most of the kids turned to the exact same behavior at the slightest provocation.

Why did they do it?  Why the hell did they hurt each other? 
Why do we do this to each other?
Why do we do this to OURSELVES?!

I can't read the news anymore, i can't talk to family on equal footing and I can't stand what I am somedays. 

I hate my species; I hate that I can't be something better than this, that everybody else can't be better than this; can't just refuse to hurt others for their own gain.  

I hate that sympathy and compassion are considered weaknesses.
that disrespect and disregard are the hallmarks of power and most of all, that at heart, for almost all of the human race if you beat the shit out of them and tell them to go beat the shit out of each other or you'll do it again they won't do the decent thing and JUST FUCKING DIE.

I still don't understand what I've seen, I'm still trying as hard as I can to do so; I try and nurture belief in a higher power as of late (not popular around here, I know; i know....) but it's so hard sometimes and all I can think of is that if there is a god I'd scream at it, 'How could you be so cruel?'.  

how can WE be so cruel?

This was probably a bitch to read, and I'm sorry for that; if anybody's actually read this far, i swear I've got a good life now; don't feel sorry for me, please.  If you do anything, just find somebody save-able victimized by one of these places and help them get back on their feet; or spread the word and stop others from utilizing them.

They have these slick marketing assholes; probably the same bastards who SEO all the 'abuse' links pertinent to these places to the ass-end of googlehits, who 'sell' the facilities to parents.

",transientfatman,114,11,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/11q3w4/on_fatness_devaluing_of_human_beings/,"Apologies in advance, but this post may be excessively long. 


I used to be huge.


When I say that, I mean it. I was once close to 450 lbs, at 6'2"". That's pretty damn big. Although my physician claims that my birth deficiency involving a missing kidney is to blame, I still accept full responsibility. Throughout my entire middle school/high school career, I overate and was sedentary. Maybe not 450 pounds worth of overeating and sedentariness (that's not a word), but I certainly did myself no favors.

Obesity is a huge concern for health. It's a terrible state to be in for health and psychological reasons, and it's one of the worst things a person can do to themselves. I certainly do not think it is ""ok"" to be overweight.


Don't let this happen to you. People will judge you. They will put on fronts, but their polite facades will fool you if you don't look hard enough, but there is such a venomous quality to their undertones that you will eventually understand. Bullies will make your life hell. High school girls? Forget about it. No chance there.


The weird part? I don't blame them (except the bullies, fuck that shit).


As horrible as that sounds, I understand why people judge fatties. Larger sizes imply a lack of self-care, and sometimes blatant hedonism. Generally, this is enough evidence. Despite not BLAMING these people, I do NOT condone their actions. Life is hell for a larger person. I know I hated myself after a certain point, and we don't need your loathing on top of our own. 



Enough about the preachy stuff, however. This post is mostly to discuss the strangest part of outward judging for appearance: the time where you are changing. I am a graduate student now, and after I got out of high school I spent the first two years of college simply avoiding overeating. I was still sedentary, to a degree. Then it hit me: I could change. I could fix this. I began working out, despite the fact that it exhausted me beyond reason. I ate healthier (not perfectly, but who is) and limited my intake. Over the two years since I began these habits, I have gradually improved my diet to where I intake roughly 1500 calories a day, drinking almost exclusively water. I also work out 4-6 days a week. 


I am still 300 pounds. I have worked my ass off (hehe, puns) for the last 2 years, and have gotten about 150 down, with no intention of stopping. The difference in how people treat me, even from 450-300, is astounding. I have always had confidence in social interactions, but now people will actually RESPOND to me. I still have 0 luck with women (22 year old virgin with no actual experience beyond getting emotionally close to several women) but that will come in time. It's simply frustrating to be assumed that I am a lazy slob because I was in the past.



The post rambles, but what I want to say is: To all you who are judgmental based on appearances, fuck you. A person should be encouraged to be healthy, yes, but devaluing human beings is not the way to help them. People fuck up. We are human. I fully support healthy habits and weight loss, but don't be a dick. It doesn't help. Some of us are even doing all we can, I promise. Just, go out and try and be supportive, unless they just refuse to change. To anyone who took the time to read this, I know I rambled, but thank you. Stay classy.

I'm sorry if this ends up being a waste of your time, honestly I don't really expect anyone to read it, but the reason I'm posting it is because, well, I need to get it off my chest.  


When I was a kid, around 6 or 7 years old, I was attacked by a boy my age. He threatened me, and pinned me down and I didn't fight back because I was afraid to hurt him, put him in the hospital, or kill him (he was handicapped, wore a halo-brace and often had ambulance at his house). I begged him not to do what he did, but he ignored me...so I did as I was told because I didn't want him to follow through on his threats, basically ended up hating myself for the rest of my life. This goes on for a few months before I move out of the town he lives in.


At 16 I decided to tell my mom what happened. Her immediate response was to ask if we had toilet paper upstairs, and when I got angry to ask what the hell I expected her to do about it. 


Later on that year, she invites the kid and his family over to our house for a christmas party (They just so happened to move into our town). It has been years since he and I have seen each other, he is very casual and nonchalant as he pretty much walks into my room like he owns it, sits on my bed, plays my guitar and flirts with girls in my room. 


I try to talk to my aunt about what happened. She tells me it wasn't real rape. My father questions whether or not I know for certain it happened. I give up on ever turning to my family for support. Nobody believes me. 


Around this time my husband and I meet. After he gains my trust through some flashback issues and sobbing-nights I tell him everything. For the first time in my life, somebody believes me. He and I got married last year, and I have to admit it helps having him around sometimes. I go into fits...weeks were I can't think of anything else, and he gets frustrated. He tells me to go to a therapist, but what if they don't believe me? We fight. I can't look at him for days. We don't touch each other for months. I get better, we are fine for a few more months, rinse and repeat. It is a vicious cycle and I know that I need help, but my whole life I have been having nightmares and flashbacks...


My own mother doesn't believe me. My father doesn't believe me. I never told my siblings and everybody in my family has just labeled me the emotional loon. 


I know I need help. I'm just terrified about it. According to my aunt this sort of thing is impossible, so even though I know what happened to me...i've just been told my whole life it hasn't. I'm wrong. Clearly, I made it all up, or I've just got the definition of 'rape' mixed up with some other word that represents forced, non-consenting sex. The kid who did it, he's grown up now, just like I am. I don't know if it bothers him like it bothers me. He's probably in college now. He's probably happy. I'm just confused, angry and scared. 


This whole thing came out choppy. I have rewritten it about three times because I don't really want to offend anyone. I don't want to waste anyone's time with this, and I really don't want to bother anyone. To be honest, I don't expect any one to respond to this thread. I imagine either I'll get in trouble for it (I don't know why), or no one will respond and it is just something I'll be able to pull up in my history every once in a while. This is the whole point of joining reddit right now. I've been working up the courage to do this. I needed to tell my story, and even though this isn't the way I wanted it to be told...I need to do it. I wish someone would believe me. I wish people didn't think I was lying because I PROMISE I'm telling the truth. This really did happen to me. I wish it didn't. I don't know who would make this kind of thing up but someone who is sick and twisted...


Like I said, I'm sorry if I wasted your time. I just really needed to talk about this to someone. Anyone. Thanks. 


Edit: Spelling. Plus I put in a wrong detail. fix'd. 


Edit 2: Changed the age because I can't remember exactly what age it happened at. I know I was close to 7, but I cant remember the exact age. Maybe 6? Please forgive me, I spent a lot of time trying to forget.

Here's the thing...  Our relationship has been slowly slipping to shit for the last ten years.  We've been married for 19, but for the past ten years, your sex drive has dropped to nothing, you seem to think ""you'll get over it"" when I have a legitimate gripe is an acceptable response, and you really just don't seem to give two fucks for me anyway.  Then, in February, you mentioned divorce.  Not me, you.  I've been willing to try to work on this shithole of a marriage for the last decade, but you... You said it.  You said the 'D' word.  I was devestated.  And then what happens?  You get cancer. 

Yeah.  So, lets see.  Our relationship is shit, you can't work anymore to help with expenses because the chemotherapy is fucking killing you, and I'm now essentially a single dad with two kids.  And here's the kicker. 

I'm not leaving.  Your cancer is stage 4b, which means your chances of survival are slim, but without my insurance, you'd already be dead.  So I'm not leaving.  I'm not backing out, leaving you to die, leaving my children, or any of it.  You know why?

Because I still love you.  God damn me to hell for it, but I still care.  I still hold hope that you're going to wake up and be the woman I married, and not the sniping bitch that you've become over the last ten years.  And, even after you browbeat me, call me down in public, take sides against me, scream at me, and basically treat me like garbage, I'm still here.  And you know what the silly thing is?

You don't even care.  I think that's the tragic part.  You know I won't leave.  You know I won't dump you, so you don't have to be nice to me anymore.  You don't have to do little things to let me know that you actually care.  You just expect me to be okay with it.

I lost my job a few months back and since finding a new job, I've yet to save much money. I have two kids so basically everything I make goes to expenses for myself and my two kids. 

My daughter's birthday is tomorrow. August 5th, actually. She's been really good and did excellent in school last year so I decided to sell a necklace and my old laptop to pay for her birthday celebration. After weeding all the ads out of Craigslist that didn't look serious enough, I ran off to meet the buyer. Everything went smooth until I tried to go to the pawn shop to buy my daughter a gift.

Our plans were to get her a gift then go to buffet for lunch on her actual birthday. That came to a screeching halt when the pawn shop owner told me that my bills were counterfeit. I had been passed $300 in fake money. So, some asshole basically stole my daughter's birthday because now I will not have money to celebrate with her. 

I'm just so fucking mad that I can't even think. This piece of shit clearly knew what I needed the money for. He could see that my items were worth much more than he paid and he still ripped me off on the price even if I hadn't gotten fake bills. 

I guess I'm just ranting and raving here. If anyone could loan me some money to do something for my daughters birthday, I would very much appreciate it and pay it back in 2 weeks. That isn't my point nor is it the major point of this post but it would be nice.

If you recognize who I am and want to talk, please just PM me. I don't want to inadvertently cause any more publicity for my relatives who just want to grieve and try to get through this.

------

Yeah. So I lost a cousin in the Newtown shooting. It was incredibly rough. I live abroad and couldn't afford to fly home on such short notice, so while I've been insulated from the direct horror of what happened, I have been dealing with the predictable level of guilt at not being able to drop my life overseas and rush home ASAP to be there for my family. However, while these issues are still pretty raw and the source of a lot of hurt, they are not what is contributing to my current upset.

Over the last couple months, the amount of harassment my family has been receiving from conspiracy theorists has noticeably increased. Some of the family members of mine who went on the news back in America have been approached and harassed on the street, accused of being actors paid by the Obama administration or ""uncle toms of gun rights"", i.e. lifetime gun owners who are actually pro gun legislation reform in the light of their six-year-old getting murdered. Who'd have fucking thought, right?

Some of my family members have received accusatory letters from crazy people, phone calls from political whackjobs accusing them of making the country a less safe place, you name it. I live on the other side of the world and even I have had an asshole in the bar ask me ""if it really happened."" People I know on Facebook message me on a weekly basis sending me youtube clips and asking if these are my ""real relatives.""

It's one thing to see these people getting made fun of on the internet, but it's encroached onto my daily life and I can't laugh at it anymore. These aren't harmless Freepers herp-derping about Ron Paul and gold hoarding on the internet--they are real, unstable assholes who are going out of their way to demean my family and their grief.

I feel so powerless to stop it, partially because I'm so far away and partially because there really is nothing you can do. People have a right to their opinions, however terrible they may be. I just wish they realized that once they use their opinions to confront other people, they cross the boundary from being acceptable to being outright hurtful.

The parents of the girl who was killed are doing as well as can be expected. They are kind, compassionate people who are trying to heal and help others heal by keeping in touch with the families of the other victims. When I think of people exploiting their grief to drive a political agenda that paints them as liars or government plants, it makes my blood boil. They even reached out to the remaining family of the man who killed their child, because they understand that the Lanza family are victims too.

The conspiracy theorists are causing me to question the state of the world more so than the shooting did.

To make matters worse, one of my own close relatives has bought into this nonsense. He brings it up at family gatherings and bombards people on Facebook with nonsense about how the shooting was actually carried out by a unit of Navy S.E.A.L.s and that the children who were killed were murdered by the government so as to further gun control agendas. He uses the fact that he is related to one of the victims as evidence of his claims, because that means he must not be lying about it, right? :(

There have been so many angry confrontations both online and off that I've lost track of how many people have disowned him or accused him of being a mental case. Which he is. He did a few too many drugs for a few too many years, and I am very sorry his mind functions that way, but I am reaching the end of my sympathies. 

My family are good people. They are not liars. They are not attention seekers. They did not ASK for the media to document every waking moment of their lives. They did not ask to become pawns being jerked about and made examples of in equal amounts by politicians on both the left and right.

We just want to grieve like normal people. Please, just let us.

When you imply that the murders were staged or that the children who were killed were killed by Obama's goon squad, what you are indirectly saying is that my family's distress is not valid or is faked in some way. You are taking away our right to grieve over the senseless, violent death of a child. You are doing to us what warmongers do to ""the enemy""--dehumanizing us, dehumanizing our grief, telling us that our feelings are not valid.

I hate the fact that this is something I even have to defend against. I'm tired of being angry all the time.

Treat her as if she isn't worth their respect, even if it involves respecting me.  No other friends in new state, just trying not to feel alone.

TL;SDR Fuck people

I don't know who to talk to about this.  My ""friends"" make horrible comments about my girlfriend for being a different race.  Now, I have dated women, or been with women of all different ethnicities.  I just like women, you know?  If I find you attractive, or fun to be around, what is on the outside has no bearing on my emotions.  It hurts so much that people I have known for a large portion of my life would be so disrespectful and hurtful, especially when I get really serious with them and tell them to shut the fuck up.  Ignoring it is like being taunted by school kids while your mouth is gagged.

I casually mentioned something, a very G rated version of what one particular person had said.  Now this person is one of the younger people in the group, and to be honest is the largest bigot of all of my friends.  His small, ignorant mind is enough to drive any decent human towards an uncontrollable urge to break his fat ugly virgin face.  Yes, he's a virgin, and most likely because he's such a tool, but anyway, moving on... When I mentioned this very censored thing the kid had said, she didn't say anything at all.  I had a phone call so I answered it, and during the call I asked her a question.  I turned to her for a response and she just tears streaming down her face.  I mean TEARS.  Like, half the surface area of her cheeks were glazed over with tear drop leftovers.

I instantly knew I mentioned something I shouldn't have.  After I assured her that nobodies opinion of us or her could convince me or sway me into changing my feelings for her, the person mentioned earlier and a supposed ""good"" friend of mine were talking about girls.  Anytime I would chime in they would say ""well, you date niggers so what does it matter?""

...Seriously?  Are you fucking serious?  I date a black girl, and because I do that, I don't have a valuable opinion?  That fact somehow makes me less of a person?  I now have to sit here and listen to you call the girl I have strong feelings for a nigger?  Fuck that.  Then to go and say ""dude you used to be the most racist person ever, so you have no right to talk"", that is such fucking garbage and you know it.  You can't fucking sit there and try to minimize what you're saying to me by lying and trying to convince others of some uber farce.  It is absolutely horrendous.  I can't believe I call you children my friends, and I can't believe I ever even considered you my friends.  You're all overweight, desperate, and willing to bring anybody else down to your level so you don't feel so sad by yourselves.

I'm coming to a point in my life where I just can't stand the childish behaviors my friends engage in.  I'm going on 25 years old, most of my friends are that age or younger.  I moved to a new state a few years ago, and other than my GF and my roommates, I have no friends here.  I have the same friends as I did back home, the same friends I game with consistently.  I just wish I had a steady group of friends in real life to help take me away from these herbs I still call my friends.

My school overreacted and called the police, who also overreacted. They searched my backpack for more and didn't find anything, and then had me empty my pockets which contained an iPod touch-- where i had my bootlegged music because my parents don't like bootlegging, and i don't have hundreds of dollars to buy my music with, and they don't ever go through my iPod--, and some ear buds.

The police started to go through my iPod, which i stupidly unlocked for them because i didn't know shit about my rights then.

My iPod didn't have anything on that had to do with the stuff i was getting in trouble for, but it did have others things on it, and the last people i wanted finding that would be the police.

For the past few months, i had been finding people on an online forum and messaging them with an app. Being 15, i was interested in 15 year old girls, so i would message these people and trade them, porn for porn. I would mostly message other guys and trade them my stash for their stash, and i slowly accumulated around 200 pictures. It became less and less about getting something to fap to and more about getting more pictures because i was bored, and that was something to do.I only ever asked for pictures of girls my age, and i would tell the few fucked up pedos who sent me pictures of 8 year olds to fuck off.

While 85% of the pictures were probably not even underage pictures, and 10% can't be proven underage because i just got them from some other guys stash, i'm terrified of the other 5%, which would be the 8 year old pictures that i never saved, but are in my conversations that i deleted which would be saved in some cache in the messaging app's severs, and i few pictures i got directly from some 15 year old girls (i never sent nudes of myself though), which i did save but never traded to anybody else.

The police quickly found the pictures--which i had in an invisible folder (jailbroken iPod, and the invisible folder was meant to fool my parents, not the police) along with my music and other stuff i didn't want my parents to find-- by going into safe mode, and they went through every. FUCKING. PICTURE....right in front of me.

The whole time the were making comments like ""Wow, she looks young"" and ""Damn, you have a ton of pictures, they just don't end"". When they finished going through everything, they took my phone and iPod as evidence and i left. After that they went to my house and searched it (like i said, they overreacted), found nothing, and took my computer as evidence (which had nothing bad on it).

Since then, the thing i had gotten in trouble for has been cleared up (I got charged with one misdemeanor and didn't get any probation, community service, etc.), but the through this whole thing i was just waiting for the child porn issue to come up. The police haven't charged me with anything relating to the porn yet, so my parents don't even know yet.

I was scared when my mom wanted to get our stuff back, because i knew they weren't going to give her my phone or iPod, and while i knew exactly why, my parents would pursue it until she figured out why they were keeping them.

My mom got my computer back, but was angry about why the police won't give back my iPod. Shes going to find out what the police are keeping them for. I know they're going to try to get archives of all of my conversations in the app to fuck me over as much as possible. Even though i didn't want the 8 year old pictures, and deleted them, i know they can still charge me for ""possessing"" them, and having those is a much worse crime than having the pictures of the teenagers. I know they can put me in juvie for a bit, and i don't even care about that because it won't be on my record because i'm under 16 and still a minor. It's knowing that they can put me on the sex offender registry that scares me.

I know what i did was wrong, but i don't think i deserve to be labeled as a sex offender and thrown on a list with a bunch of rapists and child molesters for what i did. I wanted to see girls my own age, who doesn't, and now i can have my entire life taken away from me for that.

I'm not sure if my family will understand. People at school will find out. I won't be able to get a job. Terrible assumptions will be made about me. I'll be targeted and attacked by people who find out and(understandably) don't like sex offenders.

Please don't just tell me that what i did is wrong and horrible, i know it is. I really wish i hadn't done it, and I would do anything to take it back, but i just really needed to get that off my chest because i don't have anybody who i want to know about this that would understand.

I don't post often but I needed to get this one off my chest. I was browsing around and apparently there is a subreddit called 'beatingwomen.' Firstly, I advise you never go there. Secondly, the one thing I did see was a link to a video of a young girl being beheaded by a Mexican Cartel. 

I'm from the United States and I'm white but I am self trained in Spanish and have continued schooling in that area. I couldn't get through the first 10 seconds of the video, and the first ten seconds didn't even show gore. What it showed was a young girl named Marcilera Cordova who makes $95 USD per week as a cook. She was innocent, it was pure revenge towards a rival gang. As I watched the first bits of that video I thought that if I didn't speak spanish it wouldn't have meant much to me. It would have been gruesome, but that's about it. But knowing that language, hearing the fear and sadness in her voice is eating me alive. (I mean the following with all due respect) It's like when you find your animal dead in the middle of the street. I love my animals, I'm a huge animal-lover. I once found one of my cats had been ran over by a car and I couldn't stop thinking about how horrible it must have felt and the pain that she endured. But at the same time, I know that as I looked at my cat and now as I look at this video, the pain is over. Maricela is now in a better place. She may have had drug ties, but I know that God will have mercy on her soul. There's nothing I can do, but wow. It's in those final moments when people really come out and are who they are. There are no walls, no smoke and mirrors. When someone faces their imminent death they are who they are. And when someone can take a life when someone is in that most vulnerable state, that is what disgusts me. I have no mercy for those men, but I know God does. I don't know their circumstance and I'm not here to judge. But they are evil men and their reckoning hopefully will come swiftly. If not by God or a God-like figure, by some other source.

Anyway, just had to get that off my chest. Thanks for reading.

I am 23 years old with a great stable job, a place of my own, a car, a girlfriend and great friends and family. I don't know what I can ask for more. I am pretty much set in life, but sometimes all I (we as man also) want is someone to hold and say that we are doing well, we are good.

Today was opposite-day. Girlfriend is on her PMS time and screamed at me and got angry with me for no reason (just because I broke a broom of hers...), all I did all day long was not good enough and then she went to party with her friends and her ex-bf...

Our crazy roommate, screamed at me for moving her stuff around because we were cleaning the bathroom and screamed for other useless stupid reasons as well.

My landlord screamed at me for not being home when she comes to show the apartment to potential new people (we are moving out to a better neighborhood) and made it seem like my fault and my problem.

So I went to visit my parents for a few hours to clear my head and ever there is didnt stop.

I vividly remember one time feeling so dirty, so ashamed that I would've done anything to get rid of the pain...I laid down on a hot heating vent that night at their house and burned from my ribcage down to my knees...I look back and wonder how my aunt didn't see it or if she did why she didn't stop it, or how my parents didn't find out...it just kills me because I felt so bad and there wasn't anyone that was there to help me.

I'm posting this because I know somewhere there is a child, teenager or even a grown adult that is going through a similar situation. I want you guys to know that it isn't your fault, you don't deserve what's going on and you should seek help. Whoever you trust will be there for you and they will help you, no one will make fun of you and you won't get in trouble.

I've been depressed, full of anxiety, transformed into a hermit, had my finances ravaged, and become someone stuck in a perpetual pity party.

None of this is your fault. I shouldn't have married you so early for the wrong reasons. I know you were lazy because I did absolutely everything for you. I forced you to call bill collectors for things you just haven't paid. I even called them FOR you. I'm not your mom. Your mom might still do everything for you but I deserve a MAN not a child.

But that's neither here nor there. You may chose to live life like that, but I'm not gonna be dragged down with you. I'm going to change myself and stop using you as an excuse to not attempt to live a healthy life. My childhood situation wasn't too healthy, but that's no excuse. The only thing I have are the decisions that I make today, and I'm not going to regret them.

So today, I'm changing. I'm going to organize my life, I'm going to start living for myself and stop trying to take care of other people. I owe nothing to anyone. I don't have to take care of my dad. He made his bed now he can lay in it, I love him but he's a fully capable adult. If he's going to be homeless it's because he continually chose to not take action.

Wow I'm realizing that I married my dad pretty much. Someone who above all else makes excuses instead of actions. The chain stops now. Either you get on board or I'm gone by the end of this lease. I'm done waiting for you to change. I'm done waiting on myself to change.

When you dropped out because ""college wasn't for you"", I was halfway crazy from all the work I did to keep my head above the water financially and in school.  When you bought a nice house you couldn't afford I was living in a dump with roommates because we *knew* we were broke.

Then I graduated and things started getting better.  I got a good job and finally bought a car and place of my own.

we hang out a little bit and we play some black ops zombies and such.

hes that one father thats slightly laid back and loud and just fucks around, he had a rough bout with being an alcoholic but he had been sober for 8 and a half years. 

hes been rejecting the bottle since i could barely write my own name in cursive. thats a long time. so late as usual he shows up at the door. 

my gf tells him to go ahead and wait in the car for her to get her stuff.
 so i go ahead and wait out in the car for her. 

he turns around and says 

*whassaaaaa motherfuckaaa?! how you been*
 
i reply, talk about school and such.

*cool man cool..*

i stare at him as he turns around, something doesnt seem right. more loud than usual. 

he turns around again. whassaap?

reply again. ignoring the fact i already answered 10 seconds ago.

she hops in and we had no seat belts so i just held her tightly as possible. he drives away.

here we fucking go

i whisper in her ear 

*your dad is drunk or something*

she laughs and says its the usual, even though shes not paying attention to him swerving into the other lane.

i say 

*no babe fucking look*

i point ahead as he drove close to the railing of the exit ramp. she yelled for his attention and asked if he was alright

silence for 5 or so seconds then

*shut up bitchhh*

almost clips a few cars. 

and a mile up the road i see a cop car parked in a parking lot looking ready to chase someone.

oddly enough as he swerves onto the opposite side of the road, the cop is probably fucking around on his phone or something. the one time i would want someone to get pulled over nothing happens.

we make it to his neighborhood and im ready to fucking get out of the car. 

a family, all walking and one on a bike, is almost hit by her dad. 

had a tiny heart attack. 

cant believe he would do this to us. putting his life on the line along with others especially his beautiful loving daughter? she cried. she also cried today when you 'fessed up to the others at the AA meeting, why you went from '8 years and counting' to a 24 hour coin.

good thing me and her and the others are fine.

I was never accepted as one of them because of my race. I wanted to escape the racial abuse and my parents were no help (they were abusive in their own right) so I did everything I can to distance myself from my race. Though they never accepted me they tolerated me more and more as I rejected my ""asian-ness"". 

Now I'm in college and I see a lot of Asian americans on campus and they seem so foreign to me. I don't fit in with them because we have nothing in common. I don't speak the language, I don't know the culture...I feel estranged from American culture and my ""home"" culture. I feel like a man without a home. 

To add to that, I'm an Asian guy and apparently we're the least desirable in America. I just thought I was alone in my home town because I was a loser....what a surprise it was to learn that all Asian males are stereotyped as sexless losers. Now that I've learned about that stereotype, I can't help but notice all the Asian girls around campus walking hand in hand almost exclusively with White guys. Fuck. I thought it was going to get better now but it seems like I'm still a man without a culture, no peers to call my own and now no fucking dating prospects. It's like White guys have fucked with me all of my life and now Asian women are joining in on the fun. I hate feeling this way but every Asian female White male couple I see is more proof to me of who inadequate Asian guys are. 

You know what though? I'd probably be okay with it but every fucking white guy talks about how easy it is to bang asian chicks with that self satisfied smirk then in the next breath says its because we're tiny dick losers. They speak as if they're doing asian girls a favor by rescuing them from the shame of having to date an Asian. I would be okay with it if they weren't so fucking **smug** and racist about it and if Asian girls weren't so shameless about it, joining in on dissing all asian guys. Every self satisfied white guy...every self satisfied asian girl who thinks she's so superior because she moved up on the dating totem pole...I am just so fed up with them both.

When we go out for lunch at a fast food place, friend always makes his wife get the food, drink refills, etc. Wife asked friend to take their son into the bathroom to change him and friend says he doesn't think there is a change table in the bathroom without even checking first.

Dad doesn't take Mom anywhere. Dad can go wherever he pleases, but Mom can't without him knowing every little detail. Dad gets mad at Mom for every little thing that happens (i.e. dog which HE bought for her needs expensive medical procedure). Dad leaves my mom alone at the table during a wedding and spends a huge chunk of time outside smoking with my sister's husband and chatting with him and my sister.

You need to lose what you are taking for granted like I did to realize how good you have it now. I don't wish this on anyone, but man alive treat your wives with respect and love.

I can think of many occasions when I did some stupid things that made my wife feel second class. I would give ANYTHING to take those back and be with her again. Now I am working my ass off to regain her trust that I will make her feel significant in my life.

I gave it back. Later I found out he gave me a refferal account so that when the account reaches a certain level after purchasing a few months of playtime, he would get a rare mount.

The douchebag he is... Acting like he wants to play with me and giving the game for free to me. It was just so he got his rare mount without finding someone who would play and buy it legit...

He said he gave it to a random kid on the forums because I was bad at it. (even though we just quested for a few days)
Probably the moment he got his rare mount he wanted me to give the game back. He was pulling it of like he didn't gave me the game and that I didn't played it enough for his standards. (atleast 10 hours a day) I remember when he said this: ""I bought you the game so you do what I say""
Pretty sure he sold the account on the forums and got 75% of the money back.

I have bought cars off of CL before, so its nothing new. I just don't remember people being this stupid four years ago when I bought my old Honda.

Where can i start.

First of all, If your selling tires or car parts, put them in the fucking category called car parts, I am tired of flagging your shit-posts.

If you are going to post your car on craigslist, Be sure to post **WHAT KIND OF CAR IT IS** I don't know how many posts i have seen where it literally says "" Van 800$ heres my number"". Craigslist is free man, you are not paying per letter, The better info you give the more chance someone will call you. 

I understand that you may not want to post the high mileage of your car,for fear of no one calling, But when i call you and ask you what the mileage is "" I don't know, its my daughters car "" Is not a fucking correct answer.  I will gladly wait for you to go look. Seriously though, to that guy, Good luck selling your shit bucket, you rude asshole.

When you put ""Car runs great, just needs motor""( by the way i have seen dozens of these posts in the last few weeks ) The car doesn't fucking run great. It Probably doesn't even run. 
 
Have you heard of Kelly blue Book? Its a magical website where you can put in your car year,make, model, mileage and condition, and it will give you its value. Your 1991 Honda Accord with 240,xxx miles and 4 different paint schemes , that you have to jump-start every time you want to drive is not worth 1800 bucks. I know you don't want to give the thing away, but where did you shit that number out of?

If your car is just a rolling chassis, with no motor and tranny, it probably doesn't belong under the automobiles for sale category, If its not running and needs a bunch of shit, Put it in the Parts category, also no, I don't want to spend 1100 dollars on your rolling CRX Chassis that has been spray canned black and has no interior.Its not fucking worth that dude, seriously. 

Finally my last point I want to make is , if you finally manage to sell your shit bucket, after you have gone and bought your meth, or paid your rent or child support or whatever, **TAKE THE FUCKING POST DOWN**, its not fucking hard.  Sign in to your email, Click on the email you used to post it, and hit the button that says delete. There you are fucking done, you ignorant shit head.

How is it that **a baby you don't even know yet is more important than the love of your life?** If the mother dies, that's it, she can't have any more kids, and the husband would be a widower and would have a tough time moving on and the kid would probably feel guilty growing up. If the baby dies, yes it is very sad, but the mother has had so many experiences and is ready for more that it would be a waste to choose the baby over the mother.

I feel like most take me for granted and its really sad to wake up one day and realize that no one around me even cares to know anything about me. I am sometimes quiet, but its usually because there are so many other people who are loud and command attention. I have no qualms with being an introvert. It's who I am and I wouldn't change that. I don't find this to be the nature of my issues. I wish I knew what that is, other than the fact that those who I thought were my friends really aren't. 

Today is my birthday. A time to celebrate the amazing miracle of life, but what good is life if you don't have people to share it with? Perhaps I was setting myself up for failure, but 2 weeks ago I stopped calling or texting anyone. Within 2-3 days I realized that I had always been the one to initiate going out with those that I know. Aside from birthday wishes from those that have moved away, none of my so called friends have made any attempt to communicate with me over the past 2 weeks. It's saddening and depressing to find that either no one (out of a circle of friends of about 15) wants to hang out with me or they simply never consider me when they make plans. 

I'm a fairly social person. I have a few close friends, but they've moved farther away over time. Despite the fact that I'm constantly commented on my good looks, women assume that I'm a ""player""...they tell me this to my face. I can't fucking win. In general, I feel like I am a well adjusted person. I don't have many hang ups, other than losing both a mother to cancer and a serious relationship over the past 2 years, but I do a pretty good job of staying optimistic. Unfortunately, I've reached the boiling point. 

I have reached a point in my life where I would rather sit alone than seemingly beg others to include me in their activities. I have no idea where I'm going with this, but I simply couldn't hold this in any longer. 

I feel demoralized, sad, and truly alone. I don't understand why I'm unimportant to those around me, but I don't think I can tolerate it anymore. I made a choice to be alone and depressed, rather than with the company of those who I have to pry to get time with. I'm sure there's a happy medium somewhere in there, but at a certain point one simply can not handle the belittlement and insult on personal character. 

I've found myself painting recently as a sense of expression, but even that seems pointless today. I feel contrite for letting myself here. 

I read this subreddit alot. I know that I have a first world problem here, but it is mentally and physically draining me. I'm at my wits end. I turned to this place, simply as a way to tell someone how I am feeling. I wish these tears would stop. I wish my heart would stop hurting. The one person who could help me and give me advice is no longer here.

I have worked for you for 1 year now. I have made misstakes but you always shrugged it of and told me to learn from it.

Right before you left the office for the last time today you came to me. You told me that you're proud of me and that you knew you did the right thing when you hired me and that when I'm ready to face the world I will take it by storm.

We've been married a long time, and I still love you.

But I am worn out taking care of a middle-aged child.

You wanted to be a stay-at-home mom, you wanted lots of kids.  We did that.  You hated staying home, the kids drove you crazy.  We changed things.  You got a job.  You decided you didn't really need the job so you got careless and got fired.  I had to take care of you because you were so hurt they fired you.  I had to agree with you it was their fault.

You weren't going to be happy with a regular job, you decided.  We put you through grad school.  I crammed my work in to early mornings so you could go to afternoon classes and I would take care of the kids.  You came home late, and you were pissed if I didn't want to hear about the bitches in your classes. You called me an anti-social dick because I didn't want to spend my weekends with them.

You graduated and started getting your supervised hours for your license.  Making time for your hours became the family priority.  You found a place that would let you work there.  Not for money, just for the hours.  You flirted and joked and made a fool of yourself.  You turned yourself into a joke.  It hurt our marriage.  You left that job because I couldn't put up with it anymore.  You were furious and bitter.
You found another place to let you work, for some money this time.  You broke all the rules.  You got fired.  You separated from me because I wasn't supportive.  You immediately started screwing a girl and texting me about it.  I was done with you.  

You talked me back in. 

 You talked about the kids. 

 I came back, hoping for better. 

 It's been a year now.

  It's not much better.  

Here's the thing.  You are supposed to be an adult.  You're almost 40.  I am tired of taking care of you.  I have had my struggles and my disappointments, but I have been the only adult in this marriage since it began 15 years ago.

  I am sorry we have debts.  I am sorry we have bills.  I am sorry I screwed up the taxes.  I live with those responsibilities.

You have not made more than $1000 total in fifteen years of marriage, despite your career being the major thing talked about for a decade.  It's always me.  If we get in to trouble, its me.  If you need support its me.  When you are fed up and need a vacation (from what, exactly?) I have to come up with the money and arrange for the kids to be cared for.

I love you.  I have loved caring for you.  But the time has come.  Be a child or be an adult.

If you are going to stay a child, shut the fuck up about your future and your ambitions and all the other bullshit.  I don't mind making your life possible, but I am not going to be treated like shit because you aren't' satisfied.  If you choose to be an adult, step the fuck up.

Stay-at-home moms do not order or bring in food 97% of meals.  They don't have maids and gardeners.  They don't pay babysitters three days a week so they can ""lunch"" with their friends all afternoon.  

Working women work.   They bring home paychecks.  They try not to get fired.  Sometimes, they have to work.  Sometimes, they have to be nice to people they don't like.  They often have to follow rules.

You are not a stay-at-home mom or a working woman or anything in between.  You don't make an income and you don't care for the kids.  You cook fewer meals in a month than I do.  I do as much cleaning.  And I work.

You want my respect.  I do respect you.  You are an incredible person in your heart.  I love you.  But you demand I respect your efforts as a stay-at-home mom.  You demand I respect your work.  I respect those drives in you.  I know what you wish you did and I honor you for that.  But if you want me to treat you with fake respect, so that you can pretend to not feel insecure, I just can't.  


If you want to be a bum, be a bum.  I have never minded that.  Enjoy the life that is made possible for you.  It might be silly, it might be frivolous, but it's cool.  But for fuck's sake, stop demanded to be treated like the hardest-working, most earnest and careful woman in town.

if you are going to live like a bum, do it.  Or stop being a bum. Make a choice.

I don't blame her, she spoke her mind about something I hadn't really considered to be my downfall.

I've lost almost 70 lbs since then, my confidence is through the roof, and I could probably have any woman I want.

I'd just like to thank everyone for being incredibly supportive-- I was still getting message from concerned people even fairly recently. I'd gotten a few messages asking for an update, so while nothing much has really changed a few small things have happened. 

I talked to my mum about me possibly seeing a psychologist and she thought that would probably be a good idea. I met with a few different psychologists to find one that I really like, and after seeing her for about a month she had a meeting with my mum where they discussed my home life. My mum then apologised and told me that she thought she'd failed as a mother and that it wasn't my fault but that she'd try to be a better parent. 

I told her not to worry about it, but we did discuss what would happen when I turn eighteen and now she's helping me save up money so that I can move out as soon as I can. She doesn't mean it as though she wants me gone, but she knows that I want to be gone as soon as I can. Finally, she actually hugged me after we discussed this, and it sounds silly but that was a pretty big deal to me because she's never actually hugged me before.

I don't really know what else to say. I feel a little more comfortable at home, but as much as I love my mum I know that she'll never be able to properly love me and I'm not going to hold it against her and I'm still planning on leaving as soon as I can. I still kind of blame myself for everything and it's still really hard to try and remember that it's not exactly my fault, but I think I'm over the hardest parts and that it can only really get better from now on.

I feel like at least once a day - sometimes more - I hear some snide remark about Republicans.  *They're rich ass holes, they hate poor people, they're stupid, they're handed everything,* etc.  Please, tell me where you got this information.  It is really not true.  I am a Republican and while I was certainly fortunate to grow up in a home where my parents wanted to be able to do everything they could for my brother and I, I certainly didn't live any differently than my Democrat friends who like to complain that they've constantly been deprived of things their entire lives.  

I fucking hate when people tell me that only rich people are Republicans.  First of all, I eat store brand Mac n' Cheese almost every day because I'm a broke college student (I know, I'm also the only Republican college student).  Secondly, HAVE YOU SEEN HOLLYWOOD?! I mean, honest to God, people!  All of the liberal celebrities sitting pretty in Beverly Hills get a free pass because they're on the same side but as soon as a rich person is a Republican they're one step from Satan.  

I don't even understand why its so cool to hate on Republicans.  My BF had this idiot of a roommate last year who was always trying to be the cool, hip chick but it never seemed to work for her.  We were hanging out in her room last year, doing girl stuff, when she literally said, ""OMG, mbhtonks, did you know that Ron Paul is a Republican?  I don't think I'm going to like him anymore.""  I swear, I did not make a word of that up.  She knew literally nothing about either his cause or what the Republicans wanted out of the election, but it was ""cool"" to follow Ron Paul so she did that, but its ""uncool"" to be a Republican so she was conflicted.  Poor girl. 

I'm not trying to say that its really the Democrats who are the idiots, because obviously that is not true at all.  I don't think anybody is an idiot based solely on who they're going to vote for.  I'm sick of people making all of these wild assumptions based on my voters registration.  Or even worse, of feeling like I need to hide the fact that I am a Republican - especially places like my university or Reddit - because I'll get endless flack for it or people will think less of me.  

I'm not a psycho, I'm not a bigot, I am not given anything I ever want, and I will still have to work hard for every penny I make throughout my career.

She taught science to fifth and sixth graders.  Fifth and sixth graders.  Every single year she had students (fifth and sixth graders):

* Had never seen an animal other than a goose, pigeon, cat, dog or rat.

* The **majority** every year did not know that food eggs come from chickens.  (Most common answer to the question of where eggs come from - ""the store"".  And these kids were not joking.)

* Had rarely seen a tree.  In the neighborhoods where these kids live the trees are all gone.  Those trees that remain are often too small to attempt to climb.

* Had never even heard of the Milky Way, let alone seen it.  In their neighborhoods you can see the moon at night but not much else.  They are too poor to travel anywhere else.

Many of the kids had never been outside of the city limits.  They had never seen an untouched field, a berry bush, wild flowers or chased a garter snake through the fields.  They will never see a turtle unless lucky enough to go to the zoo.  They will never get their pants wet or shoe muddy trying to catch a frog.  They will never have the opportunity to swat a dragonfly that is buzzing too close to their face.  Their experience with damming up a trickle of water will always involve concrete.  Chances are they will never hear a cow moo, pet a lamb or feed a carrot to a pony.

Once a year the sixth graders were taken to a week at a camp outside of the suburb ring.  Many of them had never heard of a raccoon, didn't know what a morning dove sounded like and most of them were stunned to learn about owl pellets.  Except for a very lucky few, most had never actually seen a forest before and chances are will never see one again.  The wind through the branches at night were scary to some.  The lack of sirens and gunshots at night was unnerving.

Fast forward 20 years.  If a storm takes out the power to the city these are the lucky ones who will look up at the sky and remember what they saw during their one and only trip away from the city.

You were right that I should be punished for my classmate's misbehavior. Thank you for making me cry while I wrote an essay about the importance of ""listening and not talking in class"" after I had not said a single word all day. Thank you for punishing me even though I had done nothing just because a lot of people were misbehaving and you were too lazy to figure out a better way to solve the problem. Thank you for teaching me that it pays to misbehave, because at least then you won't find it unjust when you inevitably get punished. Alright, I never misbehaved despite learning that, but I guess that's my weakness. I chose to do the fair thing to you even though you didn't return the courtesy.

Honestly, in all the years I've endured group punishment, it has never worked. The good kids are the only ones who really get punished. The bad kids don't care.

He's usually pretty hard to get to sleep, so that wasn't out of the ordinary, really.  But that night was extra bad, so I was lying down with him on my bed.  I had his legs locked in mine and had my arms wrapped around him to keep him from kicking, scratching, and biting me.

I wasn't holding him that hard so that I wouldn't squeeze him too much, so he managed to wriggle an arm free and started scratching and pinching me.  It had been a long day, and I was tired, so I yelled at him to stop.  He didn't, and continued his behavior.  I yelled again for him to stop pinching, and that he was hurting his daddy.  Again with the pinching.

So I said that was enough, and I pinched him back.  He didn't like it, but it also didn't make him change his attitude.  He was, of course, fussy and tired, and being pinched didn't help.

I've never laid a hand on my kids, and I know better.  Both my mom and my wife were abused as kids.  I just don't know what was going through my head when I pinched my son.  I guess I wanted to make him feel what it felt like to be pinched in an effort to get him to stop pinching me, and stop pinching in general (as this has been a problem he has had for a while now).

As of yesterday, my son still had red marks where I pinched him.  My wife said if I ever do anything like that to our kids again, she's leaving and taking the kids with her.  And I wouldn't blame her.  I would do the same thing if our roles were reversed.

Our marriage was already rocky before this, so I feel like this has been the death knell, that we're through.

It can get pretty hot there but that day was unusually hotter than most. It was a Sunday and because my dad was a pastor, my parents were both inside the church and my little brother and I were outside with all the other children. I was 5 and he was 3. I was really young and I don't really remember most of what happened but I do very clearly remember my parents desperately performing CPR on my brother's dead body and how broken they were at the funeral. The only other thing I remember is how I killed my brother and didn't even realize it until a few years after.

It was a really hot day and most of us were pretty tired. My brother had come up to me and said that he was really sleepy. I had the brilliant idea of telling him to go sleep inside our car since it wasn't locked. A few hours passed and I remember my mom asking me where my little brother was after service had ended. After I told her she ran to the car and screamed the most gut wrenching scream that I had ever heard. Moments later, every one was gathered around my parents as my dad was performing CPR on my brother but, of course, he never came back. 

Now I am 18, and when I realized how I had caused the most painful event in my parent's life when I was around 8, I tried to do everything I could to make it up to them. My parents had a daughter the year after and I have treated her as lovingly as I could since the day I realized what I had done. I have lived my life trying to make my parents as proud as they could be of me, to make up for what I had done, and they are the proudest they have ever been with my full ride acceptance to a prestigious university. But they still don't know that I had anything to do with my brother's death and whenever it is brought up by a family member, I can see the sadness in their eyes.

This has become a source of constant depression and although I always tell myself that I was only 5 and could not have known what would happen, I still could not seem to forgive myself for the death of my innocent little brother. Around the end of last year and the beginning of this year, my depression was worse than it ever was and I was on the brink of ending my life. But I remembered the thoughts that I had 10 years ago as a kid when I realized it was my fault. I had told myself that I would live for both of us and thought that it would be the worst thing I could do to end my life here and  break the last promise I had made to him. 

4 months later, right now, I have started to make peace and come to forgive myself with the help of friends who reached out and stopped me from making the worst mistake of my life. The only thing really left is to confess to my parents what happened on that day and I don't know if I can really do it. This will probably be the hardest thing I will ever have to do, tell my parents that their son who they are so proud of, had only tried to be the perfect son to make up for unintentionally killing their other son.

We would chat enthusiastically about nearly any damn thing for hours, our text conversations could span the entire day, going on til the earliest hours of the morning.

This void in my life, one that had been there so long I wasn't even sure if something was missing, was filled when we hit it off.  I felt like someone cared, I felt like a fucking human being.

But you've been getting progressively colder and more distant from me over the past few weeks.  You don't smile and immediately initiate conversation with me like you used to, day after day.

I feel like I'm being slowly pushed from your life.  Like you've been gradually working me out of your social circle by growing more and more aloof towards me. Maybe I'm a lousy friend, and  I can't tell with what little friendship experience I have.  But holy fucking shit, does it hurt for you to treat me this way.  Maybe I should go ahead  and move on, take what I've learned, what you taught me, and find new friends.

today i was complaining to her about how my ex-boyfriend was dating some girl that i didn't like. the girl in my group was really supportive and gave me advice. she took my shit while i griped and complained about such trivial stuff--about how i felt fat and i ate too many carbs at lunch. just girl talk. 

and then i told her we should meet monday after class, but she told me she was going to be absent. i said maybe that evening, but she said she couldn't because she had a doctor's appointment and she was usually sick after them. even though i shouldn't have, i asked her why. she told me she has cancer that the doctors have pretty much given up hope on treating, but she still fights. she only has a year left at most.

i pretended like that didn't bother me at all. i just nodded and told her i was sorry, but she seemed to ignore it and we started talking about our love for ryan gosling.

My dad wanted me, My mom wanted an abortion. After months of arguing she decided to have me. After I was born my mom apparently changed her mind. When I was 9 months old she left me in a Carl's Jr. Restaurant. The poloce found me and returned me to my father's care. I never saw her again. 

My father was extremely abusive growing up. I had black eyes, bruised arms,  busted lips. Scratches and a few concussions. I was always afraid of saying it was my dad, so in school I was labeled as a ""problem"" for ""fighting"" too much outside of school. Kids were scared of me... when the truth was I was lonely. Having no friends led to me being bullied alot. It's such a long story... When I was 15 I had enough. I  ran away from home. I remember the first night I was gone I slept on a bench in the park. After a week my grandmother took me in. My grades improved and I in a sense started my life over and even made some friends. 

When I was 16 I wanted to meet my mom. I looked her up and went to her house. It was an EXTREMELY awkward reunion. We really didn't talk for 30 mins until she blurted out ""You know I never wanted you right, your dad made me keep you"" I was shocked. I didn't know up until that point the truth behind my parents and their relationship. They wern't even together when I was conceived. Just one drunken mistake she said before asking me to leave. 

I was devastated. My dad abused me, my mom didn't want me. Again I went right back to feeling terribly alone in life. 

Fast forward. Here I am... 21 years old. I am getting married in a few months and I work a full 40hrs a week. We pay all our own bills without any help from anyone. Three days ago I went to the grocery store. It was like I had seen a ghost. There she was... my mother. 

She glanced at me almost 3-4 times before realising it was me. Her face lit up and she started to walk twards me. I got scared, A million things when through my mind. What does she want, she never wanted me, she hates me, or do I hate her. My heart felt like it fell out of my chest and I did the only thing my mind led me to believe I should do, and I ran. I ran as fast as I could to my car and drove away. 

I know she saw me, I know she saw me see her, and I know she knows I ran away from her. However, I can't help but wish I'd let her approach me. Find out what she wanted, what she would have said.

I turn 33. A year ago I was in the middle of a divorce. I was with her for a decade, married for a year.
This week I have arrived at a very strange and broadening conclusion. I was abused by my ex-wife. So, feel free to skip the end bits here, but what Iâm going to do now is ask a favor of you, do not do what happened to me. On either side. And DO in fact do what I ask at the end. But first, do not let anyone belittle or impugn you. Do not let anyone degrade you. You have wonderful qualities about you. Let them shine. In the same respect always fight hard to see the greatness in others. Itâs not always visible but everyone has at least one thing that makes them good. Please find it.

You may be asking âhow were you abused? You've got to be kidding.â Well some items includeâ¦

* The fights where she would yell at me to hit her. And would then chastise me for kicking a laundry basket when I became so infuriated with the request.
* How during our miscarriage I wasn't allowed to feel bad, because she would always say how she had it worse. 
* How she blamed me for every bad decision she made. It was always my fault she made that choice.
* How she blamed me for she weight problem (she was that way before we dated.....and still is a year and a half later. i'm apparently more powerful than i thought). 
* How she mocked me for crying over my grandfather's passing. 
* how she mocked me in front of friends even after i asked her (like a bitch) not to.
* how she threatened me (ultimatums â me or the dogs, me or your friends, if you donât do X Iâl leave)
* How she had other boyfriends in college and would chastise me for talking to a girl. 
* how she maintained her friendship with a man while we were married even when he told her that he loved her (seriously she should have ended it there, grossly inappropriate). 
* the way that any feeling i had other than ""full support for her"" was mocked and made wrong. 
* the way that if i had a bad day, hers was always worse. 
* how on my last birthday we spent together she invited her friends over for a party...i cooked...i cleaned....i did all the work....for her party....on my birthday....seriously, yo, that was messed up.
* the way she mocked my hobbies, the way none of it was ever good enough for she.
* how she always told me ""you need to make more moneyâ and how my job isn't good enough to support her wants.
* how i asked she to work out with me for 6 months. how she told me no every time, it wasn't her thing. then yelled at me for following in her footsteps when i didn't want to go running with she. 
* how when we looked at houses, my opinions were always wrong, and she didn't need to say why she didn't like a place.
* how whenever she didn't get her way she would IMMEDIATELY throw a temper tantrum and spin it on me and how ""you always have to get your way."" granted....every pet....every home.....every piece of furniture, art, most of our hobbies, most of our friends.....all hers. 
* how she legitimately tried to convince me that my divorce lawyer wasn't looking out for me....only she was. how i should sign everything as quick as possible and not worry about trying to protect myself. but she got upset when i stood up for myself and tried to make me feel bad about it.
* How she attempted to say that my family wasn't there for me the way she was.
* The way she ran right to him when we separated. Would sleep at his place, come home in his clothes. 
* The way that she started to unofficially date him before she moved outâ¦officially within a month. Within two years sheâs now marrying the guy.
* How when I would ask for the last 4 months âwhy do you love meâ it was all about how I was there for HER, I supported HER, I gave HER what SHE wanted. Never anything about me.

People in abusive relationships tend to have their brazen and bold act to get out of it. Mine was cheating. The way a person stabs their abusive partner to show him she's not weak, i lashed out and showed mine that i didn't need her. It was wrong, yes, but it finally makes sense to me why I did something so out of character. I met a wonderful and amazing person through it. a great friend and someone who i value and cherish. 

So on the start of my 33rd year, I do not wishes of a happy birthday. I will have one regardless. I have finally, after a decade, found myself again. Through the fog of self-hate and self-doubt I have finally seen myself. As I wiped it away I saw my own smiling face looking back at me asking âWhere the hell have you beenâ¦.lets have some fun.â For the first time in such a long time I feel whole again.

I made a rule last year, âdo something on your birthday that you've never done.â This year Iâm loving myself. 

As I said, do not wish me a happy birthday. I want something from each of you that has read this. Find someone you love. Anyone that you love. Tell them. Tell them how much you love them and WHY you love them. Show them. The simplest gesture can make the biggest impact. Pick someone a flower. Give someone a hug. Hell you donât even have to know them. Compliment someone at random. Some random person, âHey, you look fantastic!â Imagine how much that simple statement from a random person would brighten your day. 

On my birthday do not with me a happy birthday. Take the love you would send my way and give it to someone new or someone old. Someone you may not know, someone you may know very well. If you know them find a new and simple way to show them. Feeling overlooked and discounted hurts. Find a new way to share your love and your good nature with someone. Take care everyone. Itâs about to be a good freaking year.

Tl/dr â shits gettinâ better. Please share some love.

I had begged them to reconsider but they would not relent and even made me swear on a bible never to talk to him, which didn't mean much to me, but it scared the shit out of me considering how crazy they were. I never understood as they never had a solid reason why I shouldn't be with him, but I always suspected it was because he wasn't white. 

A few years later, right before I went off to college I reconnected with him and we began to date, but due to my parents always shutting me down without consideration, I didn't tell them. He was caring and loving, and although I knew there were a million other boys who would be easier to date because of my parents, I was in love. Obviously this was stupid, but I never thought it through.

Once my father found out I was with him, he went through everything I had and discovered we had been sexual, although we had not had actual sex. He went insane, calling me a whore, a cunt, spitting on me, and informing my family of what a terrible person I was. Most of my family is actually sane and took little notice, but his mother, my grandmother, was the one who raised him to be this way. The woman I had known to be sweet and loving turned on me, sending me nasty emails about how I had ruined my fathers life and I was disgusting. 

I became very depressed during this time, with my grades falling and my friends not being able to put up with how sad I was. I convinced my dad to go to counseling with me, but that failed after two session when he thought the counselor was only taking my side, when she said that he didn't need to know every detail of my life. About a month after all of this began, my grandma discovered she was in the beginning stages of small cell lung cancer. Although she began chemo, she died less than a month after she was diagnosed. 

It's been over three years since all of this, and I'm now about to graduate from college. While at home on break, my dad decides to tell me that I was responsible for my grandmothers death. She gave up on life because she was so disappointed with my behavior of going behind my parents back and performing sexual acts before marriage. This made no sense to me, as she had plenty of other grandchildren besides me to ""live for"" and I couldn't understand why my one act of normal teenage behavior would affect her. My dad also tells me how I had ruined his health and blood pressure. 

I was trying to put this behind me but today I was using my grandmothers old computer as mine just died, and accidentally clicked on the email icon. Before I could close it, the subject of old emails to my dad caught my eye, and I briefly looked at them. They brought back all the old memories of being called a whore and a terrible human being. The sting of reading that my grandmother hates, or hated, me for hurting my dad is still there. 

I know I should have been more upfront about who I wanted to be with but my controlling religious family doesn't often foster open and understanding conversation. I was a good kid. I got into a great college, didn't do drugs or drink, and spent a lot of time with my family. I didn't deserve this treatment, and I don't think I can ever forgive them for it.

It's gotten worse over the past couple of years or so, too. I get way too attached to people, things and characters, to the point where I feel ""homesick"" or nostalgic if I rearrange my room or finish a TV show or movie, which means I tend to gravitate towards familiarity. I feel really bad when I start beating someone in a video game too many times because I hate making people suffer or be unhappy. Being criticized, even indirectly, or made fun of is mind-scarring and almost physically painful, which is why I've believed that I've had social anxiety disorder up until recently. Even worse, if someone around me is angry, I'll get even angrier for no reason. I literally get pissed off because they're pissed off.

Hell, I can't even watch certain movies or TV shows or play certain games if they're too dark/depressing because it actually makes me anxious and unhappy. I feel like I care far, far too deeply about anything and everything, when nobody else around me does. 

All I want to know is why my mind wants to be over-reactive to everything, because it's really fucking annoying at this point. I can do fewer and fewer things because it feels like my emotional comfort zone shrinks every day.

It does not make me immature.

It does not make me worthless trash.

Your fourth line is obtuse to me. I've interpreted it in two different ways. One, you want to get back together with her, as in a relationship; or two, you want to just hit it.

Yeah, maybe it does look like a right thing to do, but I still trust my fiance, even after 3 months of total silence.

I'm not good at writing and my english isn't good, so I apologize in advance.

So, a bit of a background.

We've been together for almost 6 years. Actually, we were going to get married as soon as he comes back from Switzerland. We talked to each other every day while he was there. He was going to come back on December. 

So, 

* Dec 23. He calls me saying that he'll be in Moscow on Jan 3 and that he loves me. 

* Dec 24, morning. Tons of messages from him, everything's ok. 

* Dec 24, evening. He calls, but I was in the kitchen and didn't get the call. Call him back in a minute, his phone is unavailable. I think ok, nothing to worry about, and send him sms.

* Jan 1. Call his grandmother. Would've called his parents, but they live abroad (not in Switzerland) and the only phone number I know is unavailable. Grandmother says that he didn't call her to wish happy new year which is strange. And also says that all men are jerks, but it's irrelevant.

* Jan 7. Call his grandmother again. Listen to ""men are jerks"" thing again. She's angrier than before, tells me that his parents would've said her if something was wrong.

-some calls in between, nothing new-

* Mar 8. Call his grandmother. Tell her that even if he doesn't want to come back, I deserve at least some kind of goodbye speech. She says that she hasn't heard from him yet.

And here I am. I love him, but honestly the only excuse I could think of sounds more like a spy movie plot. Is it even real to not be able to use a cellphone or internet nowadays? 

Hell, we're in different countries, I can't even make a scene. Just say that ""it's over"", how hard is that? 

PS It's the first time I post in here, sorry for poor formatting.


**It seems I have to clarify one thing. Already did it in comments, but will add it to this post.**

I have my reasons to believe that he's fine but can't contact me in any way. His parents went abroad for a reason a few years ago. And those reasons have everything to do with his trip to Switzerland. I don't know how to say in in english, but it was about their property and stuff. Last time he was in Moscow he got his apartment searched, because they thought his parents came back.

I am currently 17 years old and my step-dad has been making increasingly aggressive advances on me for the last 4 or 5 years. It started at around puberty, when my boobs first started to develop. I never felt particularly close to him, but he had made efforts to be a father to me from the start. As I hit puberty, though, I now notice that he became increasingly touchy, not necessarily in a sexual way, though. In the summer before high school, he started to request to see me try on clothes for him and occasionally wanted to watch me change. My mom knew about the trying on clothes part, but was never around for the changing part. My brother, who is three years younger, was; although he didn't ever seem to notice.

Now, about a year before this time, he decided to become the ""team-dad"" for my club soccer team. This meant he organized activities and whatnot, including being around 20 developing young girls. He is still the team parent of my club team, and is friends with most of my team on facebook. About 1/3 of his facebook friends are girls my age who he knows. He also is the only reason why my family can afford to have me play club soccer.

Now, back to the concrete details. During my freshman year, he insisted on watching me try clothes or a change, as usual. Including bras and swimsuits. I never told anyone, especially not my brother, and I didn't think much of it. By the next year I realized that this wasn't right. I was not comfortable being around him and I think he was picking up on that. He tried being more touchy with me, almost exclusively when we were alone. 

Less than a year ago it snapped. He had insisted on reviewing a school project of mine, and using the laptop required us to be very close. We were in my room and my brother was in his, but my mom was not home. He had his arm around me, and once we finished looking at the powerpoint he whispered ""I want you."" This put me over the edge and I screamed. My brother ran in, but my step-dad had distanced himself and looked just a surprised as my brother. They both started asking what happened, and I started to cry and locked myself in the bathroom. 

I eventually told two of my friends about this, and later my boyfriend. They pushed me to talk to a school counselor, who got me to finally tell my mom. Her and I confronted him after my counselor, mom, and I discussed it. He denied everything and flipped out about just wanting to be like a father to me and my brother. He threatened to leave us if we accuse him of any other ""bullshit."" He's backed off me since, but has been starting his old behavior since christmas break. Oh, I didn't mention this before, but he is not actually married to my mom, although he insists on us calling him dad since I was very young.

One of the biggest fears is that if I try to get him out of our family, we will be financially screwed. I won't be able to go to college, even with the soccer scholarship I will probably receive. In fact, my brother and I would not be able to play club soccer or get college scholarships by extension without his financial support.

(NSFW because of language)",,120,28,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14pv6x/im_destoyed_by_you_you_heartless_motherfucking/,"I'm sitting here, crying my eyes out, and I've barely begun. I apologize, as this will likely be a wall of text. 

Let's start with me. I'm the oldest of 3, 21 currently. My half-siblings are 14 and 13. Yes, they drive me batshit-crazy, but I deem them full blood. They drive me crazy like full blood.. I'll get to them later. I want to keep going with my story.

My *biological* father was never in the picture. Always me and my mom, I could live with that. When I was 3, she met the man I'm talking about. I remember from the get-go I HATED him. My first memory is being around, coloring in a corner while they and my cousin John were packing up. This man was moving in. I remember he walked over, and kicked me in the ribs. Then he mushed my face in cigarette ashes in the floor. My cousin John kicked his ass, and told my mom he was taking me home. I ended up in the truck, cleaned up, wedged between my mom and my stepfather. 

I was right to hate this man. I recall instances of being locked in my room, being spanked unnecessarily, having my things taken away and broken, just because. I do remember times of making cakes and ice cream, selling lemonade, all that. I had a childhood.. sort of. I remember this one time, I was drug out of bed. I got so scared, I peed myself. He rubbed my nose in it, like I was a bad dog. Much hell ensued. I was 5. 

Then we moved away, when I was 8? I had a little brother, my sister was on the way. It was 1999. I only discovered much later he only wanted ""his fine son"". My mom and grandfather weren't wanted there, nor would the unborn child (my sister), nor I. We moved anyways, and lots of fighting happened. It was okay- my grandfather still loved and protected me.. 

Until he died. I will never forget this. He'd fallen, gone into the hospital. After 4 days, the ICU. I'd gone in the day he died, on my way to a sleepover. I'd chatted away animatedly, about the crib games and the elderly lady who liked me. I left him a rose I'd gotten in the gift shop, said I'd be back tomorrow, I love you and left. 8:30 that night, I call home, with purple in my hair. My mom sounds distant- she says she;s just tired, I love you. Next morning, I go home. Outside, I'm full of elation- I walk in, and I'm filled with icy dread. My mom pulls me aside, sits me in my room and tells me the news. He died right after I left. I was in shock, then cried for days.

This signaled my life going to hell. With him gone, HE started in on me. Daily, I faced beatings for no reason. He started making me the maid, on top of being super-good at school. My privileges were removed- no more books, no more art, no more music, no more friends, no more nothing. I had no life anymore, past pain, school and all the housework. This went on for only a month, before it got worse..

Six weeks after my grandfather died, I was asleep one night. HE crept in, and the next thing I knew.. my hands were duct-taped behind me, my mouth taped shut. My nightgown was ripped off (I had no panties- forbidden) and it hurt so badly, I was screaming. Loud enough to be smothered in the pillow. I was crying. I had no idea what was going on- I could feel hands, mouth.. other things- everywhere. I was left like that, too. At 6AM, I was drug up, forced into an ice shower, and made to get dressed.

This soon became routine. I was beaten, raped every day. I'd go through periods of being starved, because I was ""a disgusting land whale"" and ""should be fucking grateful he even condescends to use his valuable time and resources"". I was 10. I soon was covered up to hide the marks, wore make-up. I never spoke to anyone in school. I just did my work, came home. People teased me mercilessly, it was hard. HE would laugh.

Time went on, and at 11 came more. I was introduced to drugs and BDSM. I don't remember much from here. I lived, somehow focused on school. Took everything I had.. Meanwhile in my personal time, I was introduced to BDSM. I went in the hospital more than once.. they laid off after the third trip for a while, some real investigating was going on. Nothing, though. Apparently my word didn't count for enough.. And once it was over, they began again. They DID lay off or almost a year, I had SOME respite.

At 12 1/2, I rebelled. I was addicted to meth. I needed my fix. I poured myself into drugs and school. I ran away once.. and there was hell to pay, considering I stayed away for some time. I was turned into a prostitute for a while. It was horrible, the thing that finally broke me.. I could handle anything, but being violated, body and soul? No.. 

Then at 13, a miracle happened. He left. I stayed with my mom, but I had to see him summers, winter break and spring break. He was psycho, but.. the day he tried to hurt my siblings, something in me snapped.  I kicked his ass.. but what he did to us.. broke me so badly I'll never be okay. That night, and summer.. It's going to be really fucking hard to say this. I'm so fucking ashamed, but.. HE.. 

HE tied me up every night, and forced my siblings and I.. into incest. 

It's out. That unbelievable mother-fucker.. made us.. I can't say it again.. I'm curled up, sobbing like a little girl. I never told ANYONE. If they EVER knew, they would blame me, and then I'd be the monster.. wait, I already am, I failed them.. I failed them.. I'm so fucking sorry.. Don't hate me, I'm so fucking sorry..

That heartless, unforgiving, meth-junkie, worthless, piece-of-shit bastard broke us all. I fought back HARD, to no avail. I went into counseling, overhauled myself, cleaned up my act. I poured myself into school. But I was gone. No confidence, no self-esteem, nothing. I walked around, inferior, guilt-laden, broken. Cue a lot of drama, hardships, rebelling, violence, suicide attempts, struggles with meth, attempts to be perfect.. 

At 16, I moved back down to my current city. I was free, sort of. I met my SO of 4+ years. I went through high-school hell. Afterward, I finally began to heal. It's taken a lot, and tolled everyone. I remember when my siblings hated me.. that's fine. I hate them too. I hated saving them.. but I don't regret it. They didn't deserve it, but I found out my sister's been raped by a different man, one whose since been 'paid back'..

Here I am today. Clean a year. I've got friends. I've got a bit of a life. I'm ready to hold a real job. I'm in therapy three times a week. I'm pulling myself together, but he.. he got away with it. No charges were ever laid.. and I hate that. I fucking well HATE how he got away with it!!

I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I HATE HIM! YOU BASTARD! YOU'VE DESTROYED ME, YOU DESTROYED THEM AND ME! YOU TOOK AWAY MY LIFE, MY INNOCENCE, MY EVERYTHING! I FUCKING HATE YOU SO MUCH!.. AND YOU, MOM, FAMILY, EVERYONE AROUND- YOU ALL CAN GO FUCK YOURSELVES TOO! I TRIED AND TRIED MY DAMNEDEST TO TELL YOU, TO SHOW, TO GATHER EVIDENCE. DID YOU EVER LISTEN!? NO YOU DIDN'T! YOU ALWAYS FAVORED THEM, BLAMING ME FOR WHAT I WAS FORCED TO DO! YOU CAN GO FUCK YOURSELVES AND I HOPE YOU ALL DIE! ESPECIALLY YOU, MOM! YOU HYPOCRITICAL, UNCARING WHORE! YOU CUNTRAG, YOU LYING, CONNIVING BITCH!

I apologize, I lost it. But it's true. I'm quite creative.. And I've got back-up who'd help me. After EVERYTHING, though.. I'm still alive, in one piece. I function again. I'm an artist again. Life is good. The hard part is having little trust. I NEED my control back. I can't hurt people, I'm terrified of even mildly disappointing anyone. I'm terrified of men.. and my poor SO knows it. But, it's the teeny-tiny things. He lets me tell him to do tiny things, like bring me water if I'm busy, or grab a book for me. He calls me his Mistress- I like it. Every day, he compliments me, tells me how proud he is that I shared myself so deeply. He says he'd like to see us take off. I want to be successful too. And I'm NOT going to hear anything about how it's a bad idea- I know, very well, what I'm doing. 

I just had to let this all out. I couldn't take it. I'll answer anything asked, elaborate anything fuzzy. With one notable exception. 

Reddit.. I'm so sorry I made you listen to me. I had to say it. It's been years, but it's never going to be right. He got away, scot-free.

Thank you.. and I'm sorry for anything you found offensive.

Edit: There are some things I need to add. 
* Messed up the word 'destroyed' in the title. My bad. 
* My family seemed to either not know or simply not care. Inexcusable either way.
* He feels NOTHING. No guilt, shame, nothing. He denies anything EVER HAPPENED, and tried to make me a liar. I'm not sure how this worked. He's actually tried to get me to acknowledge him as ""my father"". I don't HAVE a father. After the evil!? You want me to be your CHILD?! Even if you were a MODEL FATHER FIGURE which you aren't, I STILL wouldn't want to. Besides, I'm over 18. Sheesh.
* The reason I posted. He's coming down to see his children for Christmas. I turned into ice when I heard- my blood is cold. I want to run away.
* This is the big one. I broke down and cried because of all the support. I honestly expected this to get buried. My heart goes out to all of you.

Do I like men? No. Well, not really. 

The first time I saw a cross-dresser I was intrigued. What she did with her body other women in the community were envious of. I admired her beauty just as much as I admired the beauty of natural born women. I struggled with my sexuality since I was a young man because of this - I was too worried about properly labeling myself and my sexuality. 

Eventually at 19 I would have my first sexual experience with a cross-dresser. She was voluptuous. The minute I saw her I knew that she was what I wanted. First experience was everything I hoped for, 2nd experience was not so hot. Nothing wrong in particular it's just that the spark wasn't there anymore, the thrill of the taboo was gone. It was then I realized I enjoyed the fantasy of being with a cross-dresser more than I enjoyed intimate relations with one. Fast forward, I'm now 30. I love women. I want to marry a woman. I do however enjoy the fantasy of being with a cross-dresser. It's only a sexual fantasy because I have no intentions nor desires to pursue a relationship like that. So that's how I've defined my sexuality. **I've come to terms with the fact that it's okay for me to have these desires.** Even if I don't voice them with anyone in public.

For a long time the entire year of 1995 has been a blank to me, but strange flashes of memories have been coming back over the years. I remember a man with tan, pimpled skin and cold eyes leering at us from a blue car. I thought be was somebody's dad for a while because he was always around the elementary school, but I never saw children with him. I have goosebumps just thinking about him almost twenty years later.

One day he followed us to the park and parked by some trees. He held up a gun and gestured for me to come closer. I was scared of him, I did as I was told until my big sister saw what was happening. She grabbed my hand, I grabbed my friend's hand, and we ran as fast as we could. We didn't stop running until we were home with the door locked behind us and my Mom called the cops. 

 I haven't slept in two days because I finally realized that this was around when my best friend stopped coming to school. I can't remember--was she in the park with the three of us that day? Jesus Christ, Cecelia, did we leave you behind? If I left you alone with that scary son of a bitch I as good as killed you myself. I don't want to believe it, but it would make my family's odd behavior on the subject over the years make an awful lot of sense, especially the weeks between her disappearance and the news of her death. 

I can't find an obituary for her, I don't remember her last name. I can't find any news reports about her one way or the other. The not knowing is driving me crazy. Strange as it is to say, I hope to God she was hit by a truck like my parents said. The alternative is unthinkable.

**UPDATE:** I just had a very long talk with my mother and sister and I think I've figured a few things out. The memory loss covers more time than I initially thought, first of all. All together closer to two years missing than one. According to them I saw my neighbor's corpse being removed from her apartment when I was five and freaked out about it. A few months later our family was at a diner waiting for our car to be towed and we got mixed up in some sort of DEA bust. I remember jack shit but my sister seems to remember everything, and talking about it really seemed to shake her up. It was the most disturbing conversation I've ever had.   

When I asked them about her they were quick to assure me that she wasn't at the park the day I saw the man with the gun, which is a relief, but they wouldn't tell me much more. I'm almost certain my Mom knows more, but no matter what I said she just kept saying, ""That's enough for today"" and eventually became magically deaf until I changed the subject. It's not like her at all. Why would she be so open about everything else and then clam up? I'm trying not to be angry with her, but I don't get why the hell she won't help me make sense of this. Hopefully Dad will be more reasonable.

I'm still determined to find out what happened, but I might be on my own. You've done more than enough by  letting me vent, but if you happen to be a good internet sleuth and want to help me out I'd appreciate all the help I can get. Without posting any identifying information about living people I can say we went to Palmer Elementary in Denver, Colorado. She was six or seven when she died and I think she was an only child. She was black, had brown eyes, and I think she was average height and weight for her age. She didn't wear glasses or have any other unique features I can think of.

We're friends with the other's parents. 

We got back in touch. You and I hit it off pretty well. We chatted each day away, and had lots of fun doing it. We did get kind of stuck on ""sex"" mode, but that's fine during the honeymoon stage. We decided to meet. it was only a ten hour drive for me, and I was unemployed at the time, so I went up for a weekend.

Things unraveled in bed the night I got there. I asked you what you liked. Your answer was to tell me that talking in the bedroom was unsexy. Okay... So, I improvised and used what few moves I knew -- having been a virgin until last year, I didn't exactly know many.

But you stopped me. You stopped me, and you said, ""You know what I hate?"" and then you demonstrated on me one of the things I did -- licking the ear and then blowing on the licked spot -- by slobbering over my earlobe and blowing into my ear canal. 

I started to point out that if you'd just told me from the outset what you didn't like, it wouldn't have happened, but you cut me off and told me, again, that talking was a turnoff. You spoke to me like I was five. Embarrassed, I backed off, so you started groping me like a teenager -- you *honked my breasts* -- I gasped in pain, and you, you moron, you dare say to me, ""Yeah, see, I read your signals there and eased up, see how much sexier this is?"" And I wondered just how big a majority of the girls you've ever been with faked their way through your horrible bedroom antics because you make a six figure salary and are generous with it.

I didn't say anything because god forbid I be unsexy, and you asked me if I wanted to fuck. I declined. You told me you could tell how wet I was. *I was wearing a menstrual pad.* I declined again, and we went to sleep. The next day, you give me the ""just want to be friends"" speech. I should've noticed that you were preempting me.

The whole situation stuck in my craw for two months. I didn't get why it didn't fade away like most terrible graspings under the sheets would. 

Last night, I realized why. You put me in a situation where I was denied the knowledge I needed to succeed, then you made me feel small and stupid for failing. It was a fucking power play.

I'm a 31 year old male who is only now starting to realize and understand that I'm good enough to have a relationship and be loved for who I am. For years, I've watched everyone around me breeze into romantic relationships and even marriage, while I've always felt on a deep emotional level that I didn't 'deserve' women, that my mere presence was an imposition to them, and that my needs were something best kept to myself if I didn't want to be shown the door. My sister has never gone more than a week without a long-term boyfriend since she turned 15, which only made me feel worse. Years of solitude passed and I got progressively more sad and isolated. 

I've dated quite a bit, but I've never been able to legitimately imagine having a long-term girlfriend or getting married - such concepts seemed to exist solely in the realm of fantasy and imagination, like getting drafted to the Chicago Bulls. I don't know how else to explain it - it's just like that specific part of my emotional brain relating to being good enough to love and be loved simply never grew into place.

I've been told by many women that I'm highly attractive, handsome and desirable, but I've never been able to ""know"" any of this on a gut level, like I know that I have brown hair and I'm good at putting sentences together. I was also repeatedly shamed and inculcated with sex-negative messages (that's a subject for an entirely different OMC), and the combination of sexual shame and a feeling of inherent inadequacy has given me performance issues in the bedroom, which makes me want to bash my head through a brick wall - all of my youngest and most sexually potent years are passing by in a blur. 99% of my sexual activity has remained relegated to masturbation and porn. I've probably had sex less than 30 times in my entire life. I WANT SEX, like any normal well-adjusted male, but it's always had such shame and embarrassment attached to it that the idea of approaching a woman for sex feels like asking if I can take a dump on her kitchen floor.

Background: Abusive alcoholic father left when I was 11, I rarely saw him or interacted with him even when my parents were married, and I barely know anything about him. Saw even less of him after they divorced. Alcoholic mother made me into her therapist, her confidant, her sounding board, every possible role of emotional support. I was too young to realize what was happening at the time but now I'm understanding that I lost my entire childhood and a major part of my adult life dealing with things I should never have had to deal with and feeling guilty and worthless when I couldn't deliver.

Looking back, there are so many disgustingly creepy red flags with my Mother that it makes my head spin. She took me on ""dates,"" including the week before I left for boot camp, where we went to Chicago, went on a dress-up dinner cruise and spent four days exploring the city together. I was 17 and didn't know any better, and now it just makes my stomach clench. When I did leave, she told me she slept with my pillow because it smelled like me (retch). Aside from that, there were so many incestuous, sexual and romantic overtones over all the years that listing them all would turn this into a wall of text and just creep you out.

Even understanding all this, I feel guilty and ashamed for no reason, just because I've gotten so used to feeling that way.

I suffer severe chronic pain. I am in my 20's, and I even ""look"" healthy to the average person. They won't know anything is wrong until I tell them. I don't drink or smoke tobacco, and I try my best to respect others around me because I appreciate not everyone is fond of the smell like I am.

But I am sick and tired of being demonized for using marijuana as a medication, especially by people who have no idea about marijuana at all.

Stop telling me that the only reason I use it is to get ""high"". Even if that what the case, so what? I'm in CONSTANT pain 24/7, you're telling me I have no right to relief? Does a diabetic with low blood sugar get high from sugar? Does an asthmatic get high from their puffer? NO! When I use marijuana, I feel normal for once. I rarely feel high.

Stop telling me that marijuana is the reason why I am depressed. You want to know why I am depressed? Because I have to constantly prove/defend myself to others, because no one believed me when I told them how much pain I was in, and because no one was willing to give me anything to get relief from it. Because my family abandoned me when I needed them most. Because it's so hard for anyone to understand what you are going through and are all alone. Let's not forget the fact that I have severe chronic pain.

I get labelled a drug seeker unfairly because I suffer ""invisible"" pain and I use marijuana. Maybe if someone gave me medication to treat the pain when it first popped up I wouldn't of have went out to seek relief from marijuana, and it actually works for me and I can totally deal with the side effects.

I am NOT a ""pothead"". I am trying to be a productive member of society, but no matter what I get demonized by people who don't understand.

I smoke it from time to time but I usually vaporize it or cook with it. I understand that the smell isn't for everyone and I try my best to contain it with air purifiers and febreeze. It's not like I am going out there blowing smoke into everyone's face when I am out walking.

I have to put up with people who smoke tobacco. Walking on the street, if someone is smoking in front of me walking, I will have to cross the street unless I want to deal with an asthma attack.

I am scent sensitive and allergic to perfumes, yet I have to constantly put up with people who bathe themselves in Eu De Toilettes and colognes. People even spray it right in the elevator where there are no vents, and I literally hold my breath for 16 floors. If I breathe it in I will have one hell of a coughing fit because my throat closes up. But not many people are mindful of the scents they spray.

Even though it makes me sick to my stomach I don't complain about the smell of curry on my floor (I got food poisoning from an Indian restaurant and it haunts me to this day).

What I do in my own home is my business. It's not like I'm going out in public and smoking it on the street, I dont ever do it around kids neither. If I do it out in public I make sure that nobody is around and I will go to a secluded area.

Please stop telling me what I can or cannot do in the comfort of my own home. We all have to put up with shit we don't like, including other people's ignorance and their scents. Please stop demonizing me for trying to find relief. If you wont let me smoke marijuana in peace, then let me kill myself in peace (without being sent to a hospital to be locked up and forcefully ""medicated"").

************************************
Original Post:
This might pale in comparison to a lot of real problems people have but I'm so mad at the world right now. I'm 25 and I have a 13 year old sister who I practically raised. I would do anything for her.  She is the perfect kid. She always studied hard and never had to be told what to do. She's polite, really gifted and above all modest. She's never been to a concert before and she never asks for anything but to spend time with me which I often can't do because I work all the time.

She has always wanted to go to a concert and every time I look into getting tickets the only that are available are so overpriced I can't afford it. Today I thought, screw it, I can't really afford it but I want to do something really special for her so I went online to find z100 Jingle Ball tickets for her birthday and I wanted to find 3 so I could take her and her best friend. Craigslist had a bunch of posts and I got in contact with someone and drove an hour in the middle of a busy workday to meet up and buy 3 tickets. Tickets looked and felt real, so I paid $450 for the 3 and I was so excited I called my parents to let them know. Right now my sister and her friend are just giddy with excitement about going to this concert. They get to see all their favorite musicians (yeah - Bieber and One Direction, they're 13 year old girls). 

The problem is I'm also positive they are fake. I realized it after I did a barcode scan on all the tickets. The barcodes are all the same. And a local ticketmaster agent who couldnt' verify if it was real or fake noticed one of the tickets has a different shaped apostrophe than the other. In other words, I got scammed out of $450. But as hard a hit as that is (to put this in perspective, I've been sleeping on an airbed and I don't even have a couch to sit on), what really upsets me is knowing what my sister's reaction will be when she finds out. 

She'll want to be mad at first, but she'll understand right away and she'll feel bad for me. Then she'll cry. Fuck. Just writing this is seriously making me tear up. This is a kid who had to go through her father having a stroke when she was 6 years old and never really getting to know him the way he was beforehand, always being pushed into taking classes after school to the point that I feel like most of her childhood was wasted and yet she still turned out so perfect. I haven't seen her this excited in YEARS and now I have to take that away from her. I feel rotten, to the core. So many little things I didn't notice when I bought those tickets. I wish I could just take that moment back. 

TL;DR: I bought my awesome little sister who never asks for anything tickets to the Jingle Ball concert. Tickets are fake and I hate that I have to break the news to her.
*******************************************
EDIT 1: Wow. You guys are amazing. Here I am clearing my mind and you start helping a total stranger. Regardless of what happens, it won't be forgotten. I thought I would share with the community how I know the tickets must be counterfeit. Maybe someone will be lucky enough to see this before they make the same mistake I did. [Four signs of a fake ticket](http://i.imgur.com/FF5t9.jpg?1)
*******************************************
EDIT 2: I love what a little shut-eye can do for the nerves. I talked with my sister and told her what happened. I called earlier to tell her and her friend's mom told her friend. I think she took it well but obviously she's upset. She had one of those sudden emotional shocks but immediately said it's okay. She didn't really get mad, just sad. I think she's old enough to know that these things can happen and mature enough to take the loss. I haven't told her about this thread or about my email to z100 but I told her I'll make it up to her. 

As for calling into the station, I've tried getting through to Z100 but the line is busy persistently. To be honest, I can't really see them doing anything. I think what it comes down to is that a lot of people want to go to this concert, and just because I made a stupid mistake (to buy tickets off a guy on craigslist), doesn't mean I should get special treatment. I'm going to keep trying anyway but I've got to be at work soon. Also, thanks so much to all of you who offered to make a donation.
*******************************************
EDIT 3: I did actually just get through and the kind lady on the phone let me know that unfortunately there's nothing they can do. They said they gave away all their tickets and the only way I could get them is by listening to the show. I'll try to call in as much as I can but the odds aren't very good.
*******************************************
EDIT 4: I had a pretty incredible day today considering how bad yesterday was. Even if no miracles happen, all of us are in good spirits and it's because of all of you. There is one thing I need to say before I go on. I'm a little ashamed that in my EDIT 2 I posted an email by which I could accept paypal donations. Reddit user ""Poiewf"" actually sent me $50 and that was one of the most self-less things anyone has ever done for me but I've decided I can't accept it. Sure I want to recoup the money but it all feels so dirty asking the community after what happened yesterday. I feel worse because I posted my email to accept donations and I think I was raised better than that. If I really needed it, that'd be one story, but I'm doing fine. I don't have a couch because I just started living on my own in an expensive suburban city and I'm just waiting to save some money first. Buying expensive tickets obviously wasn't part of the plan but it's nothing that can't be recouped given a little time. The truth is I have a decent temp job which pays enough to get by. My naivete or stupidity shouldn't be rewarded. 

Now onto some real news. Today I called the 42nd precinct where a really helpful detective suggested I called NYPD's DICE (offhand I can't remember what this stands for) who might be able to setup a quick sting to catch this guy. He also told me to call the 44th precinct because the exchange happened on their turf (near Yankee Stadium). No body answered at the DICE but I talked with a policeman from the 44th. He said I could come in and report a larceny. Once I'm there, I can take a look through mug shots. I know this sounds crazy but due to the amount of good will from Reddit I've received, I can't really hold a grudge. I know I want to stop him from ever doing this again, but on the whole, I feel like I've become a better person because of what happened. 

Finally, the last update for now. I was contacted by a reddit user who apparently works for State Farm (from her email) and she mentioned that she might be able to help me. I have no idea what she can do, but she asked me for proof of all of this so she could help me. I sent her everything I have except for my text messages (no idea how to send sms convos to an email). I'm keeping fingers crossed but even if this doesn't work out, it's okay. I don't think I've ever felt closer to my sister than I do right now.
***********************************************
EDIT 5: GOING TO JINGLE BALL! Reddit and Reddit username ""statefarmer""...to quote the Beatles who I sourced for my username, ""you done me good!""  Brandi, the beautiful stranger from State Farm (who PMed me last night) worked with some folks at State Farm to get my sister and friend VIP access to a (State Farm sponsored) pre-event happening right now in the city. AND they just found some tickets for us to go to the Jingle Ball screening room concert. I dropped off my sister, her friend and my dad at the train station and they are hustling over to the pre-event before it ends. At this event they have a chance to meet Justin Bieber and a few other artists. My dad has no idea who any of the artists are so it would be funny to see his reaction. If they aren't a 70s-80s Russian Euro-pop artist, he's probably never heard of them. I'm going to meet up with the group prior to the concert and switch places with my dad who has a holiday party to go to tonight. 

When I posted this initially, I really was just trying to get some anger out. This has all been really humbling. Thanks you everyone for your suggestions, Poiewf for the Reddit Gold (now we're even ;D ), and Brandi and Linda from State Farm, you are the best! You've made two young teenagers so happy today! They will never forget tonight, and neither will I! Reddit and State Farm, I love you. BIG LOVE!

One more thing...I gave the fake tickets and a few sharpies to the girls to hopefully get some autographs tonight. 
*************************************************
EDIT 6: Last update: Jingle Ball was awesome! We had a small hiccup as the tickets were for two different venues. We thought they were all for the viewing party so we waited in line. My sister handed over the ticket, got in but then her friend's ticket wouldn't let her through! Why? Because it was for the arena! Same for the ticket I was holding. This presented a small problem as (a) I didn't want to leave their side and (b) once the ticket is scanned, it's a dead ticket. I had my sister exit the viewing party and we walked up to the arena entrance. I had a security person explain to them/me how to get back to the exact spot we were in once they get up there. Sadly, neither of them had a cell phone so once we separated there was no way we could contact each other. Their seats had a view of the back of the stage and a screen but not a direct view of the stage. Once I set them on their way, I was thinking how awkward it would be for me to explain to a supervisor the story of the tickets so that I could get into the viewing party with my now dead legitimate ticket. I might have just walked around the city but it was raining. It was funny because it felt like I was one of maybe 8 men in a sea of hundreds of screaming girls. What's worse is that I was walking in alone, no girlfriend, no kids. Once I got into the theater, my seat was pretty close to the front and I had to be on of the tallest people there. I bought some popcorn, got comfortable and enjoyed every minute of the concert. Actually seeing all those artists perform 'live' was really awesome. Most of them sounded much better in person than recorded. It was a VERY energetic concert, with a great line-up. Most importantly, the girls loved it. They were all smiles, all night. 

Oh, and before I forget...as I was walking out I had a security person scan the fake tickets. Result: They were indeed fake. 

Thanks everyone for your help and suggestions. State Farm and aeropostale, thanks for giving my family a night we will never forget. :-) This is just such a great story about the good people are capable of. I don't have the words to properly convey how thankful I am to you.

I'm an adult god dammit, and Its time I start 'acting' like one.

Not because of all of her idiotic behavior that I have stated previously.  She pulled me, hard.

On Thursday, I was coming into the apartment, and while unlocking the door, she (inside the apartment) flung the door open.  As she did so, I lost the grip of my keys that were still in the lock.  So naturally, I reached over to grab them, and she took her right hand, grabbed my right shoulder, and pulled me into the apartment to get past her as she left.  Now I know you may not think this was such a big deal, but she dug her fingers into my shoulder pulled me in pretty aggressively to the point that I had to catch my footing after she let go of me.

After she did this, I was so shocked that she even touched me, that I just went into my room and locked the door.  She then left.  I decided to go home for the weekend because that was enough, and I needed to get out.  When I went home, I called the security director of my apartment company and told him what happened, he told me he would talk to the general manager and get back to me on Monday.  

Monday I'm waiting and waiting for him to call, and he never did.  So I then wrote an email to the general manager and told him everything that we had already talked about.  Her wanting to sue the company, this non existent black mold issue, and then about this latest event of her showing physical aggression towards me.  

The next day, I get a call in the morning and the apartment company has offered for me to live in a two bedroom place all to myself that would normally cost double the rent, but I would get it for the price that I had been paying previously.  Apparently, they don't deal with roommate issues unless it becomes physically threatening.  

So now I'm moved in!  I absolutely love my new place and even though I'll only have a few months here, it was extremely worth it to move.  I feel so much happier now, and more importantly, safe.

You don't know me...but you slept with my girlfriend.

[She] and I had been dating six months when you messaged her on Facebook wanting to ""catch up"" for a drink. You caught up, you told her you used to have a crush on her, you asked her if she ever thought about what it would be like to be together, you bought her drinks, and you took her back to your house and you had sex with her. Maybe this was your intention, and maybe it wasn't. It doesn't matter now. She and I are done - and you, [motherfucker], played the key role in that.

What do you expect is going to happen now, [motherfucker]? The two of you are going to fall in love and be together? You think she's going to just be able to leave a completely stable, healthy relationship and just start one up with you like nothing ever happened after she cheated? I'm afraid you're wrong.

I've had my words with [her] about this already, I've spoken my peace with her. But know this, [motherfucker] - anything I could say or do to her at this point wouldn't hold a candle to what she's putting herself through right now. She is in a very dark place. This is a direct quote from a text she sent me when she told me about all of this:

""I'm a lying cunt and I don't know what to say. I ruin everything and I'm sorry. Even if it means losing you - I can't stop crying. Please just break up with me. I'm fucked up. I'm a liar. I'm so fucked up, [MFCORNETTO]. I don't think I will ever change and I deserve all the horrible things I think about myself. I'm a selfish child, nothing more. You should give your love to someone special, not me cause I'm a fucking trainwreck. I'm going out of my mind and you're too good to be with someone disgusting like me even though I love you. Fuck, I'm sorry.""

This is what she's doing to herself because you decided you would take a former friend of yours out for drinks and see what happens. ""She's got a boyfriend, but big deal - maybe I can change her mind.""

Well, [motherfucker], you didn't change her mind. The decisions the two of you made behind my back have put her at rock-bottom or worse. I could've helped her through this, but our relationship is over because the decisions you were a part of and she is no longer my responsibility, she is her own responsibility. She is in such a dark place she doesn't want help and she is so drawn into herself that she is the only one who can bring herself out of it and she doesn't think she'll ever get better. Based on the text she sent me that I quoted above, she is in no place to even start helping herself. She is drowning, and that is a direct result of you not leaving well enough alone or even being happy for her being in a safe, loving, stable relationship for once in her life.

But you don't care about her, [motherfucker]. You only care about yourself. If you cared about her, you would've let her be happy.

I don't know why you did it. Maybe you're bored. Maybe you're lonely. Maybe you're a good guy who is in a bad place and you made a bad decision. Maybe you're just an asshole. Again, at this point, it doesn't matter. What happened happened and there is no option for recovery for our relationship, and maybe not for her on a personal level - and again, that is a direct result of you chasing after a girl who was happy in her relationship so you could get your rocks off.

You're 25 years old, [motherfucker]. You're a grown-ass man. Do yourself a favor and start acting like it. 

Next time you need to feel good about yourself, go out to a bar/show/club/wherever you go, pick out a pretty girl, go up to her and say ""hi."" It's that simple. You're better than having to prey on girls you knew when you were 12 and ruin their relationships just because you're too insecure to find someone of your own.

You and [her] will never be together, [motherfucker]. Every time she looks at you, she's going to hate herself for what she did. What both of you did. I hope you remember that forever.

I remember when I got a pet guinea pig on Christmas day when I was ten and he locked it in an air-tight tupperware container and left it in my bed. My entire life he has done nothing but hurt me and for so long I just accepted it and thought that I must have done something to make him hate me. I was able to forgive him and we'd have short moments where we would play games together and everything was okay until he lost a game and suddenly had another violent melt-down. 

My brother started getting therapy when he was twelve and has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and Asperger syndrome. Ever since he was diagnosed, it's like my Dad just expects me to let everything go. I'm not allowed to say how fucking scared I feel every night going to sleep in the same house as him. My brother used to have some good days, where he'd be okay for a few hours at least but now he's just hostile all the time. He might only get violent everyday or two, but no matter what's happening he has shout and scream at me, and yet he wonders why I don't want to be close with. My dad keeps punishing me and saying I'm being a selfish bitch for pushing him away but I swear I don't mean to be selfish. I know he's sick and I know he can't help it but I just can't deal with his behaviour every single day. Just last week when I was driving and my brother was in the back-seat, he started to fucking try and strangle me. He does those kind of things all the time, just hurting me for no reason and saying that it's okay because it's a joke. The one time I tried calling the police when my brother attacked me and left me with a broken rib, my dad grounded me for a month without any electronics or books. 

I feel like my dad doesn't care about me at all and he doesn't care about how scared I am or how much my brother hurts me. I feel like the worst sister and a horrible person for saying it, but sometimes I just really wish that I had been born into a different family where I could actually feel safe.

My brother had made me do something for him one day and my grandpa either overheard or saw or something, I still don't know. However, instead of trying to help me by making my brother stop, my grandpa blackmailed me by saying he would tell my parents that ""he knew what I was doing"" unless I told him everything. He also insinuated that the would have liked me to do the same for him, but I didn't. To this day, though, my grandpa still looks at and touches me inappropriately, but I've never told anyone (about my grandpa or my brother) except my boyfriend and my best friend because I don't want to tear my family apart.

I've been writing about her for a year now.  I love everything about her.  I waited for her to break up with her boyfriend, I've been waiting for her to be ready for me.  But I can't take the hot and cold anymore.

Last week we had an amazing date.  A few days later she texted me from a concert ""I so wish you were here.""  I was like, this is it, she's finally ready to let me in.  

Then she went on vacation for the weekend, and she comes back and, nothing.  No texts, no calls.  Then her ex checks her in at a concert.  Awesome.  Then, out of pure desire to torture myself, I stalk out his Instagram and he has been posting pics of them together.

I can't take the uncertainty anymore.  I can't let her push me away again.  I am going to tell her my feelings and I know she is not going to choose me over him.

And that's what makes me hate the fucking whole of existence.  He is such a piece of shit.  She knows it but she is still choosing him over me.  They don't touch, they don't talk.  They cheat on each other.  It's disgusting.  She and I are so good together and yet I still can't win.  I have been single for a year and change, I haven't even gotten laid.  I love everything about this girl except her utter terror at ever making a decision.

I woke up to the loudest noise i've ever heard and realized what happened.

I couldn't breathe from the air bag dust and I remember that awful smell of metal, plastic and heat. I grabbed my cell phone and called 911 myself, then tried to punch my way out of the car through the windshield. 

My entire body was crushed and black and blue from all of the bruises. I'm only 5'2 so when I drive I have to move my seat super close up to the dashboard so my knees were practically touching the dash. My body hit the steering wheel so hard, it ripped 5 holes into my liver. 

I literally was dying in the hospital for a few days until they could sew my liver back up with metal coils, basically learn how to use my legs again, but thankfully only broke my arm and a rib.

I have scars and lumps of scar tissue everywhere. Most of it is below my belly button but there's a clear outline of my seatbelt on my hips, my ankles are two way different sizes, my knees are fucked, im rickety, and my hands are scarred up as well. that was the most painful 6 months of my life and every time I explain it to someone, I'm worried it sounds like I'm bragging. 

I can't go rock climbing, I can't ride a bike for more than a few miles, can't fucking run and even when im having sex my hips start to throb.  People constantly ask me to go do that kind of stuff and I can't. For the most part they know what happened to me and they'll just say; so, get over it and go. Like it's just in my head or something. And when someone new asks me to do something physical, I have to explain to them what happened and it makes me feel like i'm bragging. Like I only have had one major event in my life and everyones already heard it before. 

I should be fucking dead. Yeah, I can't do a triathlon and yeah I do have a little post trauma issues I got from my accident but, how about you stop asking me to do things you know I can't. I don't think I can get over it and I don't see how I could. I know the people who don't think it's a big deal could never function or bounce back to where I am.

I was getting a new pair of dress pants for my school's Turnabout dance, and I was with my parents in a department store (I'm only 16). I can't quite remember what my mom had made for dinner the night before, but I think there was something wrong with it because my whole family had the shits that day. Unfortunately, I was the first victim.

I recall having a stomach ache all afternoon, but it wasn't until I entered the department store that I understood the gravity of the situation. There was a definite moment when I felt the burden of my stomach ache drop into my bladder, and my small intestine issued an elongated cry for help. In retrospect, I should have gone straight for the bathroom, but I naively decided that it wasn't that serious. After a couple minutes of scoping out I picked out two pairs of pants and my parents led me towards the dressing rooms.

There was a speaker right by the arch leading into the dressing rooms, and the music grew louder as we approached. I decisively chose this moment to let out some of the long-restrained gas I had built up. What followed was quite possibly the wettest flatulence I have ever experienced. I'm positive that we have all had a moment in our lives where we fart and wonder, ""Did I just...?"" This was one of those moments. I got inside the dressing room and immediately dug a hand down to check if I had indeed shat my pants. When I drew my hand back up, it was coated in a putrid shade.

Naturally, I panicked. *Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck. Ok, what are my options?* I scanned the room quickly, surveying any possible escape route. I was becoming increasingly aware of the seeping stream of shit between my ass cheeks. Should I swallow my pride and tell my parents? The very thought of the resulting conversation answered my question for me. There was no way. *I need something to wipe with. Paper, plastic, anything.* It was around this time I noticed a pair of Dockers laying on a chair in the corner. The smell of my own dookie began to fill my nostrils, choking me into submission. At that moment, I became less than a man; I became an animal. My mind ignored all preconceived notions of right vs. wrong, and began to think simply in terms of survival. My asshole needed to be wiped, and so I completely disregarded the consequences of my actions. I pulled down my shit-stained boxers and found solace in that pair of khakis. I wiped over and over and over until the beige pants were tainted by splotches of a sickly brown. I balled up the khakis once I had done the deed and hid them behind the chair in the corner. The price tag said they were $59.99.

I tried on my dress pants, my parents came in to give their stamp of approval, and we walked out of there. I have no idea how they did not smell the pungent odor of those tan pants laying miserably in the corner. The worst part of the entire ordeal, is that upon exiting that dressing room, I felt no remorse. I had no regard for the circumstances. When paying for my dress pants, I smiled with the man behind the counter and asked him about his day. He had absolutely no idea that I had ruined a $60 pair of his pants. Following my checkout, I immediately sought out a bathroom and proceeded to unleash a torrent of shit. While I sat there on the toilet, I thought of the man or woman that would find those balled-up, destroyed pants. Who would have to handle those? Who would smell that stench first, a customer or an employee? Would they even clean the dressing room after finding it, or would they just throw out the evidence like I had? What had I done?

Ever since, I've been slightly troubled by that day. Am I a bad person for not having considered who's lives I had impacted? Would I do it again under the same circumstances? Before this ever happened, I assumed I had my morals in check and was by all means a ""nice guy."" But after desecrating that fitting room, I'm not so sure anymore.

",tightspot,93,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/j2k5c/yes_i_defriended_you_bro/,"Why one 46-year old man would email another saying ""Why'd you defriend me, bro?"" and even get a second friend involved, I have no idea.  It's not like we were ever close.  I only see you three times a year or so when said mutual friend has a barbeque, so I would like things to be polite between us, just to keep everyone happy.  I'm that kind of an idiot.

So let's see, why did I ""defreind"" you (has that word made it to Websters yet?)

Maybe it's because two female friends who live in your town (you don't know or don't care that I know them) have informed me that you've harassed them in supermarket parking lots, sometimes in front of their children.  I've seen you do this to women before, so I tend to believe them.

Maybe it's because you told me you wanted to ""pop (our mutual friend's 16 year old daughter's) tight teen cherry"".

Maybe it's because his 15 year old daughter has accused you of making sexual advances.  I don't care if she's in and out of juvie, I don't see how he could ever take your word over his daughter's.  But that's for him and his wife to decide.

Maybe because years ago when we were in high school, another friend's sister passed out drunk at a party, and you told me you wanted to take her out back and rape her, like I was supposed to think it was a funny joke, so I drove her home, unlocked the door with her keys, carried her inside, and left her sleeping it off on her absent parents' couch, since her brother was too high to be bothered and laughed at you.  Maybe no one else remembers this shit, but I do.

So yes, I can be polite, and for the sake of keeping everyone in our group happy, say hi to you and fist-bump you the few times a year that I see you.  But no, I don't want to be associated with you.

I miss you every second you aren't around.

I miss us living together, I miss the fact that you never forgot to kiss me before you went to work even if I was still sleeping.

I miss us cuddling, we fit together like puzzle pieces.
I miss falling asleep in your arms and you holding my hands as we drift off. 
I miss the parties, I miss our show, I miss our inside jokes.
I miss the back rubs. I miss the sex. 
I miss you looking into my eyes and calling me beautiful.
I miss sneaking back into the house at 3 in the morning.

I want all of that back. 
I know the break up was bad, but every day we didn't talk killed me.
When you kissed me that night we started talking again and told me you loved me, I don't remember a moment in my life I've been happier.

Between your competitions and travelling and me getting my life on track, putting this ""trying again"" thing on hold is too hard.

But ill wait.

We still talk.

Just texting is too hard.

When I saw your face the other night, it took so much to not run over and kiss you right there. And the way you looked at me made me realize you feel the exact same way.

I know we will work this out. We have been through too much together. 

I heard you talking to your friend that night we started talking again, I heard him telling you not to let me go. I heard you telling him you don't plan on it.

Since the day I first saw you, I felt something, and now I know better than anything else that you are the love of my life.

We will get through all of this, I got my new job, I have a new place in a few weeks that I can afford, and you have everything worked out. 

When the season is over, we can try again. Clean slate. No distractions, no issues, just a fresh start.

We can fix this, we can start a life together, we just can't ever give up.

I love you.


Edit: Thank you for the comments guys... This relationship is a roller coaster ride. There is a part 2 under this same alt account. There will probably be a part 3... And that will be it.. whatever happens after he comes home next week, will determine whether we can carry on or whether I should move on.  Let me tell you folks, I was never one to believe in true love or love at first sight, but for those who haven't experienced it... It is the most beautiful, most wonderful, darkest, best, ugliest, and worst feeling in the world all at the same time. It's usually easy after all of this to realize that after a second chance, I shouldn't keep my hopes up... But what him and I have is something that very few ever get to experience in their lifetime.

In the last two weeks, we've had a ton of other family stress and I'm just so fed up.

I have a 14 year old daughter.  She's pierced, black hair, black clothes - yes, I know she's going to stand out.  But it's gotten to the point that it is utterly ridiculous and I'm so tired of hearing ""well, if you didn't let her dress like that.""  Or ""if you made her go to church.""  Like what - only kids that wear Abercrombie and are Baptist are protected from harassment??  Bullshit.

My kid is completely appropriate in how she dresses.  Hot Topic may not be MY choice, but I'm not her.  She's a beautiful girl.  She's smart and funny and compassionate and kind and well-read and traveled.  I wouldn't change a thing about her.  

No ONE deserves to be bullied.  

This is the letter that I wrote her principal.  

&gt;My daughter, XXXXXXXXXXX, has been experiencing systematic bullying for the last several months.  She has gone to the guidance counselor, the Principal and her teachers multiple times.  There are a group of girls who are singling her out, making fun of her appearance, her dress, mocking her speech in classes, even threatening to beat her up.  She's had her ipod stolen, which was worth $250.  The boy who has it has bragged about it but nothing was done.  XXXXX is scared to go to any more authority figures as each time she has, the adult who is intervening has gone to the kids bullying her and said ""XXXXXX says that you....""  You can imagine how this has only increased her stress levels and the amount these kids target her.

&gt;XXXXXXX has been relentlessly bullied for her religious beliefs - including in front of teachers.  She's had kids telling her with teachers involved in the conversation that she is going to hell.  The teacher's never once stood up for my daughter.  She's an 8th grade student and a 14 year old child.   Her religious beliefs are her own and are her legally protected right.  I also firmly believe that God does not condone this kind of bullying of a child, no matter what.

&gt;Specific examples include - during XXXXXXX's math class on Wednesday 5/8 - a student named YYY mocked XXXXXXX by repeating her speech in a distorted and ""slow"" voice for several minutes.  This was obvious to the entire group of kids.  This is also the same girl who has threatened to beat XXXXXX up and also has intimated that she has a group of friends willing to do the same.

&gt;In the gym locker room, XXXXXX has been targeted for her looks, her weight,  her clothes - even her underwear.  It's gotten to the point that every single day, she begs to miss gym.  This is primarily a group of girls that includes a girl named ZZZZZz and her friends.  

&gt;Her ipod was stolen by a boy named FFFFF.  We've contacted the school about this several times and were assured it was ""being investigated.""  

&gt;We have allowed XXXXXX to try and deal with this on her own - encouraging her to speak to counselors and teachers.  This has only made things worse for XXXXXX.  

&gt;I would like to make sure that the school is aware of these situations so that they can keep XXXXXX safe.  She is a very sweet and compassionate little girl and we very much wish she had a better school experience.  Her grades have suffered since this has begun and her stress levels at home are significant.

&gt;Thanks for your time.

So yeah, no need to respond.  I just want to share with the world how UTTERLY OUTRAGED I am.

I have to live at my parents right now.  But I am being threatened with all kinds of stuff.

My depression has gotten to the limits of just ending my life thanks to having almost no support except from my parents.  They don't know what to do nor do I.  I'm seeing a counselor for everything but it's like talking to a brick wall it seems.

I dunno, I have attempted suicide twice before thanks to the night terrors from deployment.  It's just getting to that edge again and I just can't fucking stand it now.  I'm honestly lost and I'm eating way more than I should thanks to my anxiety attacks.  This is they only time I have EVER said anything about this to anyone what so ever.  I'm sorry if it seems like I want attention, but I don't.  I just want this to be over and I want to experience happiness for once.  I can't even see my fucking daughter if she is mine.

""Um, not really..."" - Him
""She is just like her father. She has the worst moods. Right?"" - Her

It's been driving me insane basically since I joined reddit and especially today.

First, so everyone understands, **I AM A WOMAN!** Not a man. So don't call me misogynistic, a word that so many women seem to throw around like meaningless confetti nowadays.

Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I've always been one of the guys. I get it. Often guys make sexist, perverted jokes. I don't get pissed. I make one back. *Hey, shouldn't you be in the kitchen?* *I don't know, shouldn't you be on your knees servicing me like the slave you are? And so on. It's just a joke and no one cares because no one means it.

But every single time I log on to reddit and I look at comments and I see someone make a joke that could just possibly have sexist undertones, I see an explosion of self righteous bitchiness. And it got even worse when I discovered the Men's Rights movement. In small towns, we don't hear about these things, you know? But I actually spent a few days researching and learning about it and I was very moved. Then I discovered multiple forums/pages/subreddits supported by so called feminists, and I was appalled by their behavior.

I grew up thinking feminism means **equality**, plain and simple. The right to choose to be a suburban housewife or a working mom or a CEO or whatever your heart desires. Now I've come across women who seems to think it means superiority and/or zero accountability. I understand that there are radicals on every side of every issue in history, but seriously, 3 out of every 5 self proclaimed feminists I meet online approach issues with a bitchy, closed minded attitude and they advocate for some things that disgust me. 

For example, I was part of a conversation with a woman who claimed she was raped. **I was raped. When I was little girl. I take this shit seriously.** She explained that both she and him had had a lot to drink (alluding that he may have had more). She says they had sex, as in she said yes even though she wasn't entirely sure. It wasn't one of those ""I was saying no in my head"" situations, it was straight up she  decided to do him. In the morning she realized she didn't like him and wouldn't have done that sober and asked the community if she should press charges. And they said yes! I understand what men mean when they say that'll ruin his life, because I've known a girl who made an accusation of rape for simple revenge (a whole different situation) and saw what it did to him. So please tell me why you have the right to ruin his life because you regret what you did? He was drunk too. Maybe he took one look at you and thought ""Oh, nasty! I've gotta quit drinking!"" but was too nice to say it and sure as hell wasn't going to claim is was rape.

Uhg, this is long now so I'm gonna stop. **TL;DR there are a lot of women online who say they are feminists, yet instead of empowering women, they are openly sexist and bitchy and just plain old wrong. It's caused to me lose a lot of pride in my gender.**

It was to be perfectly content, where we were, with not the smallest inkling of a desire to be anywhere else. To hold each other as we either drifted back to sleep or to slowly wake up together. I guess I miss those mornings most of all.


EDIT- First off, holy shit I am eloquent at 4 am. Second, we broke up about five months ago, not recently.

In terms of why I ended things, she didn't cheat on me or anything, it was just that the relationship was much too complex for where we were in our lives. I haven't been with anyone since we broke up - not even on a date - and you could say I've been in a social rut since. Although I've been trying to do new things and improve the social aspect of my life, I seem to miss her more every day and I constantly think about how good life was with her. As you can imagine, having this mindset does not translate to having confidence and my attempts at meeting new women are dismal at best.

In terms of other stuff about me that I think is pertinent to this story. I'm in my mid-20s, professionally employed, comfortable money-wise, physically attractive (6 ft, athletic build) and able to build rapport with people quite easily.

**Fast forward to last night...** I went out drinking with some friends (had a shit night out in terms of meeting new women) and on the way home I managed to convince myself to visit a brothel. I wasn't too drunk and I figured spending some time with a beautiful young woman would help get me out of my current dismal state. When I entered the main lounge area, I was in high-spirits as you tend to be when you are around a large number of attractive women.

There were quite a few decent ladies around this joint and I found myself particularly attracted to this young, dark-haired woman who I found sexy in a girl-next-door sort of manner. We chatted for a short-while and I decided she would be my company for the night. Before we began, she asked me whether I'd be interested in the 'standard' or 'deluxe' service. I believe in most brothels, the bare minimum 'standard' service grants you oral and vaginal sex with the lady leading the act (ie. you have no say when you get oral, what position you have sex in, can't really touch her that much). The deluxe service allows you more intimacy with the lady (ie. kissing, touching and control of her by you are allowed). I opted for the standard service as I imagined having an attractive young lady in front of me would be more than enough for me to have a great time. After a few health checks and a shower, this is where the (supposed) fun began.

We started things off light and she proceeded to give me a back massage. This got me in a relaxed state and it gave us a chance to chat some more. After the rubdown, I lied down expecting this young lady to continue to lead the act and take it to the next level. However she just laid there and basically told me: ""you take the lead"". I started to caress her entire body with my hands and I lingered my lips in front of hers as if I was about to kiss her. To my surprise, she started kissing my lips (apparently not part of the 'standard' service I paid for but I didn't complain) and this is where we really started to get going and things got confusing for me. Also, I'm not exactly a germaphobe, but the thought of kissing a (legal) prostitute would usually disgust me and I'm very surprised I didn't recoil my face back in disgust when she started kissing me.

As we locked lips, it reminded me of how I would kiss my ex-gf for long periods of time as we held each other. As we were kissing, she was vigorously rubbing my cock, trying to make it hard to get things going. But at this point, I believe the only reason why I got aroused was because of the intimate nature of our kiss and embrace. After a short while, she put a condom on my cock and started giving me head. Surprisingly (even though I had a condom on - this has never been a problem) I did not enjoy oral and I found it difficult to stay hard. Knowing my wood was slowly diminishing, I suggested getting straight to some PiV action to close out this experience.

I managed to keep enough wood to last a few minutes with her on top, then missionary and then a short amount of time in doggystyle. But I lost it and she realised this too. We still had a short amount of time left in our booking, so she laid her body around me and started kissing my neck. We then started kissing each others lips and after a very short while my erection was back. Unfortunately, when this happened our time was up and I had to get dressed up and leave. Even though I didn't cum, I found the experience very rewarding as I felt some of the intimacy I'd been missing since I broke up with my gf. I also think this woman was taken aback to how happy I was, even though I didn't cum.

Even though there are a number of social stigmas associated with visiting a brothel by a man (ie. you can't attract women without paying them hence you are low value), I'm glad I went through this experience because it has taught me a few valuable things about myself:

* I don't possess the sport-fucking gene (the ability to have sex with no emotional attachment) as my sexual arousal is largely driven off the intimacy of the act (ie. I enjoyed kissing/caressing her body a lot more than her sucking my cock). **The only times where I was able to get aroused reminded me of the intimate moments I shared with my ex-gf.**
* I miss my ex greatly and until I find a way to deal with her not being in my life, life will continue to suck as it has socially/romantically.

That's all for now, thanks!

My sister and I have never really got along. When we were kids, she used to torment me - always hitting and scratching me, making me cry, getting me in trouble, typical sibling bullshit. I'm not here to grind an ax about that. I'm just giving you some background: she and I have never really been close.
A few years ago, she dated (she says dated, I should really say 'fucked') a dude for a while, then wound up pregnant, then he disappeared. She kept the baby (and denied that she was pregnant up until six months into the pregnancy) (no, really). She dated another guy who left her, then one of our friend's fathers, which tore his marriage and our friendship apart, until finally she started dating a guy solidly for a couple of years. He turned out to be as insane as she is. 

I am almost certain that my niece (the child from my sister's vanishing boyfriend) endured abuse in her and her new boyfriend's home. When we first got custody of her, she used to cry so much every time she had to go to the bathroom, or any other time when we had to change her clothes. She did NOT like taking her clothes off EVER. Also, starting when she was two, she used to put her hands down her pants and play with herself. She used to have nightmares and kick and yell out things like ""I don't want it!"" in her sleep. Even now, years later, she still is not sleeping throughout the night. When she stays with me, she has to sleep next to me, and if I get up in the middle of the night, she will start crying and come find me. Since getting custody of her, I have tried to be very kind and patient with her as she is now very withdrawn and sensitive, and I do see a positive change in her behavior as a result, but I can't forget seeing her scream out for help and cry in her sleep. I almost hope I never find out exactly what has happened to her because I don't think I would be able to stop myself from killing my shit sister and her shit boyfriend.

My sister got pregnant with another kid from her shitty boyfriend. This time, instead of paying too much attention like he did to ""his"" daughter (my sister's designation) he hardly paid any attention to his son. I know for a fact he didn't hold the baby the entire time he was in the hospital, and my sister claims he only held the baby once while she loaded the car up with groceries. My sister felt bad about the second baby because he was born premature, and her boyfriend was angry with her about the baby being small and unhealthy. As a result, she hardly held the baby too. He had to stay in the hospital for almost two weeks after being born, and he jaundiced and had a lot of trouble breathing. No one really thought he was going to make it. My sister told me she wished he wouldn't have. 

My sister and her boyfriend had a rough relationship. I didn't think he was outright abusing her (the truth about my niece didn't come out until after their relationship ended. I live in another state, and I adopted the children after they had already been taken out of her home to foster care). When my mom found out about the abuse, she offered to take care of my sister and niece, but my sister wouldn't allow it because she wanted to keep their family together. My sister told us later that she used to watch her husband beat the shit out of her babies. She said it was because she was afraid of him, but I'm pretty sure it was because she was zonked out on drugs as often as possible. 

About a year ago, my sister tried to kill herself. When that didn't work, she went and tried to kill her boyfriend. She was promptly locked up, and the kids were taken into protective custody. It took us months to get them back. They now live with my parents because I live in a studio apartment. My family is not rich, and my parents don't have a lot of money to throw on a lawyer. I spent thousands (right at five thousand, to be exact) of my tuition money that I saved to return to school on a lawyer to get the kids out of protective custody. My sister was mad that I didn't spend that money bailing her out of jail. She didn't care that her kids were taken away from our family; she was upset because she couldn't visit her boyfriend in the hospital because she was stuck in jail. She has said before that her kids ruined her relationship. Later on I did manage to borrow enough money against my retirement to get my sister out of jail just so she would have a chance to lawyer up for her domestic violence criminal case. 

Since bringing her home from jail, she has been as shitty and hateful to us as ever. She blames my family and me for not helping her out of her situation with her boyfriend before it 'got that bad', even though (as we've reminded her several times) we tried to convince her to move back in with us to escape him. She thinks my mother is a terrible mother to her children, too. She accused my mom of brainwashing her kids because they call her by her name and not ""mommy"". To be honest, my mom has only ever let her them call her granny so as to not confuse them. Sometimes they call me 'mommy' and sometimes they call my mother 'mommy'. We correct them, but they are legitimately confused as to who we all are and as to who my sister is because they don't remember her too much from being in jail for a while.

My sister wasn't supposed to stay with my family because of her domestic violence case, and she isn't supposed to be around her children, but my mom talked to the judge about it, and now she is staying with them because she managed to screw up every opportunity she had for herself to stay somewhere else. She attacked my friend that was letting her stay with them, she was kicked out of a shelter for attacking a manager, and she was thrown out of another home that a friend from church was letting her stay in because she was stealing their pain medicine out of the bathroom cabinet. 

She fully believes that my mother abused us when we were children and that I've repressed all memory of it happening my whole life. While I will say that my mother isn't the best mother, she has done nothing but try to help my sister out of this situation that she is in, and I don't think someone who sadistically tortures people also wants to legitimately help them out. She allows my sister to live with them rent free just so she can be near her children and in their lives, she gives my sister money to drive out of town to visit her abusive boyfriend (my sister becomes very, very violent if we don't let her make the drive to see him), and no matter what has happened with my sister, my mom always lets her come home, even if she is physically violent toward her, which happens about once a week or so. 

She tells my parents all the time what her children will do, what they better not do with her children, blah blah blah. She doesn't have a cent to her fucking name, and she is a worthless pile of shit. She can't work because she has a pending court case, which is what employers like to call a ""red flag"", so she just stays home all day and sits on their couch. Both my parents and I work full time jobs. She actually bitches to my parents that she doesn't like being home all day with HER children. The financial toll of caring for two toddlers and a grown idiot have burdened my parents to the point of having to move from their four bedroom house into a tiny two bedroom apartment filled with roaches. I bring them and the children groceries every Sunday, and my sister bitches that I'm bringing her kids generic groceries so that I can have named brand food for myself, even though anyone in my kitchen can see that my cabinets are filled with *literally* only Ramen and hot chocolate. 

I know that my sister is sick. She has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. My mom spends so much fucking money every month for counseling (for her abusive relationship) and for prescribed medicine to keep my sister calm, but my sister doesn't take her medicine, and she hasn't visited her counselor for over three months. She thinks that my family is the only thing making her crazy, and she constantly bullies and intimidates my parents in an effort to force them into signing custody of her children back over to her so that she could get back with her boyfriend, whom she has started referring to as her husband. I wish she would have succeeded in killing herself once upon a time so that she wouldn't bother us anymore. If she was dead, maybe I could lie to her kids every night when tucking them in and tell them stories all about how they did have a great mom who was a lovely person that they would be so proud of if they knew her.

1359448157.0,83,self.offmychest,17hjzu,No one will listen to me -- so I turn to Reddit,fallopianluge,99,16,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17hjzu/no_one_will_listen_to_me_so_i_turn_to_reddit/,"Hello, I'm a 19 year old Chinese-Canadian girl. I've been going through a complete explosion of emotions and no one in my family wants to hear it -- and none of my (few) friends want to hear my usually cheery self be serious.

So, where do I begin?

I used to love being Asian -- I was the stereotype: excellent grades, did well in my extracurricular sport of choice, had a seemingly loving family, etc.

I found out my Dad cheated on my Mom and it completely ruined me. He didn't just cheat on her, he cheated on the whole family. The amount of betrayal I felt when he proclaimed he was getting a divorce so he could look after that whore and her kids that weren't even his on the other side of the world. ""Goodbye forever!"" he happily yelled at us. I just turned 14 and no word of this is a lie.

I retaliated until I spat blood and couldn't talk for over a week -- not that I had anything left to say. I couldn't eat or function, I just cried.

Now this is shaping up to be a pretty sad sob story, and I'm sorry for that. I realize that everyone has a moment that really made them into an adult, and this is mine. I feel bad if you feel obligated to read this, I really just need to type it out and have the possibility that MAYBE someone would read it.

My grades started dropping, I had no passion for anything. I still made the honor roll when I graduated at 17 but not valedictorian like I'd hoped (it went to my only true friend in high school, so I wasn't too distraught). I got into the university I wanted to go to.

I had mononucleosis in grade 12 and it messed me up even more, I never recovered from the fatigue that comes with the disease -- it came with me to university. My first year I failed a calculus course because of it and I thought the world was over (little did I know, many people have to retake it, as I did). So my plan was to just take the remaining prerequisites and then take random courses to get a high GPA to get into business by next year. It's my 2nd year now, and I think I may have to take another ""bum"" year just to get a high enough GPA to get into business and that makes my parents and especially me see myself as nothing but a pile of expired potential and fucking uselessness. I'm still tired and there's nothing I can do.

It's my 2nd year now, I'm still exhausted, I still cry about my dad even though he saw how young my siblings were and felt morally obligated (because I told him he should) to take care of them so he's still around and horrible to everyone in the family. I don't know about the whore, but he travels a lot and is mysterious about everything. It hurts so badly to just accept that there is no trust and he's as connected to me as a stranger I've never met before when I used to adore him with all my heart.

I feel like the Asian stereotype is mocking me now. I don't have the grades, I don't have passion, I don't even have someone I can talk to about this so I resorted to going online. I usually hide behind my distress with comedy and so my friends don't like to see me when I'm hunched over and crying -- I understand it must be uncomfortable, but they always try to change the subject and make me feel better, but it doesn't.

My grandpa just died too. My Mom is tired of me asking her if I could talk to her, my sister is boy crazy and in middle school, my brother is a gamer and doesn't want to spare a second. My friends mean well but end up hurting me.

But now I'm at the end of my story, and I want to say thank you to anyone who stuck with my scattered thoughts throughout this. Just the idea that maybe someone ""hears"" me comforts me greatly even if it opens myself up to ridicule. I feel like I can see a little better now, and breathe just a bit more.

I feel bitter. Is there hope in love if no one values it? If everyone keeps breaking the bonds of it? I don't know if I can lay my trust in anyone again. There's too much pain, too big of a risk.
