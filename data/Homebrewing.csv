The pic was of a fellow proud homebrewer sitting in his garage looking over at his boil kettle, fire underneath, and him holding his reason for the night's brew session in the foreground, a Blue Moon. 

For my comment I want to apologize.  Sometimes saying what first comes to mind isn't the right thing to do, in fact, it was wrong and I apologize. He soon posted his recipe which contained a couple extracts, some orange peel, [enter clone recipe here].  

He replied to my post as he was in the process of deleting the whole thing. He was pissed and confused by all the hate, and I am ashamed to say, rightfully so.  

I wanted to start this thread in hopes of discussing this often unspoken topic.  Education and encouragement should be one of our priorities on this sub and not hateful negativity to an aspiring fellow home brewer.

EDIT: Started thread not knowing it hadn't been deleted. OP had -9 votes minutes after initially posting and thread disappeared off Alien Blue ""New"" and thought he had deleted.

I have seen a lot of “How can I make Cider” or “How to xyz my cider” or “my cider tastes like butthole” posts lately and I've been planning on doing one big post as a frame of reference and to try to finally get some concise answers or at least vague advice for people who make cider or are planning to. 


The term ""cider"" is very ambiguous. I see arguments sparking here often of what a “cider” actually is. However, that argument is irrelevant to the process of making something that is actually good to drink.  


I will attempt to divide this into more simple and concise categories and discuss techniques and strategies for each. First I will make notes on things that are important for any recipe.

These notes are made on research, but mostly, personal experience. I'm sorry for the wordiness, **I will try to highlight the most important points for those of you (i.e. everyone) skimming**.  


Please give me a few minutes to double-check formatting, this has been a long process.

- - - - - - - - - - -
Firstly:

There are some things that go for every type of cider you can make:

1) **Do not boil your ingredients**. Do don't unless some particular ingredient that is not fruit requires boiling for extraction. If you boil your juice/fruit/must you will get something that tastes so bad your garbage disposal will spit it back up. 

2) There are three things that are absolutely and completely an ingredient in every recipe.  **Good Juice, good yeast and patience.** Honestly, if you can use fresh-pressed apple juice from good apples, do. It will completely make the difference between a typical cider and an incredible drink. However, I make great cider all of the time without spending out the ass on fresh-apple juice. 

-If you are using cheap mott's type juice, try to put at least part of your juice as fresh pressed or at least use some pasteurized fresh fruit. It will make a huge difference. And try to avoid the 100% Vitamin C ones, but completely avoid  with potassium sorbate. 

3) In these recipes, **I highly (9/10 times) recommend adding actual fruit matter to your ciders. Especially when using particularly aggressive yeasts.** It will not only improve the ""fresh-cider"" type flavor, but it's good for yeast food.  Fresh is always best, but frozen works great too. Freezing ruptures the cell walls and helps make it easier for more sugars to be processed by the yeast. What about bacteria? See pasteurization method below. 

- - - - - - - -
Another note on fruit additions

**Primary**

**If you add a few pounds of fruit in primary, you're going to start with a beautiful colored concoction.  It's going to ferment out completely and you won't be able to tell.** I've seen cider start red with raspberries and completely lose all the color in two weeks. 

However, **it's good for your yeast. It also adds character to the nose and adds a body to build your secondary fruit addition upon**.

 I always add fruit at both primary in secondary (if I add fruit).

**Secondary**

**If you want to maintain the color and flavor of your chosen fruit, add it at secondary**. Use the mash method shown below and add it when you're within a few points of your targeted final gravity. 

- - - - - - - - - -

Pasteurization:

There are a few methods of pasteurization. Frozen fruit is usually pasteurized before it's frozen, and I've yet to have problems simply dropping it in without treating it. However, you will get much more color, quicker fermentation and more flavor if you blend and ""mash"" the fruit.  This also applies to frozen fruit.  I have had *wonderful* results with the method shown below. This method was given to me by user Biobrewer, so please send karma or puppies his way:

*I literally mash up the fruit really well (usually a few pulses in the blender is good), and add just a little water, enough to make it fluid enough for heat to transfer (doesn't take much since there is usually a fair amount of fruit juices). I then heat up to 110 F with some pectin enzyme for 30 minutes, then pasteurize for 4-5 minutes at around 170 F. Lastly, I cool by submersion of the pot in an ice bath, sanitize the outside, and funnel the fruit mush into the fermentor and rack the beer on top.* 

- - - - - - - - - -


Okay, so you've skimmed down to this far and you're thinking ""when the hell is he going to talk about actually making cider"".  Well now we can get down to business. I will go over Apfelweins, Graffs and Typical Ciders.




1)** Apfelwein / Apple Wine **

*This category is strictly regarding wines that are fermented with a strain of yeast typical to wines such as Montrachet, Coate des Blanc, Champagne etc.  A really, really good apfelwein is arguably much more complex, generally drier and usually a higher %ABV beverage than other ciders.* 

Strategies In Making your Wine:


-**Do not use Montrachet or Red Wine yeast.** I commonly see Red Star Montrachet yeast suggested as I believe it is in Edwort's Apfelwein recipe. I also commonly see people who use this yeast say their cider tastes like, well, ass.  Don't confuse poor choice of yeast with poor yeast, Montrachet is a great yeast, but it is a Red Wine yeast. Your cider typically should not resemble the thickness, spicyness or richness of a red wine.  Note: Yes, you *can* use Montrachet, but more often than not you are looking at a minimum of 9 months from pitch to glass before it tastes decent and usually it still doesn't. (although we all have preferences that are different). White wine, champagne, and hybrid yeasts are much more fitting.

-Firstly, I am in an area where I really only see Lalvin and Red Star strains. I have used both and it seems that Lalvin is a common brand on this sub. In my opinion, Lalvin creates superior dry yeast. I highly recommend them all. To simplify the difference for those who can't really choose (or don't care), it really comes down to how sweet, green or dry you want your wine. **My favorite is 1116(K1V).  A white/champagne hybrid that requires little to no-sweetening for a refreshing flavor in even a young wine (5 months pitch to glass minimum).  If you are on the fence about your apfelwein yeast, use 1116** A little tart, a little sweet, a little dry. 

-Following in favorite would be 1122. To me, it seems on the verge of a white/vino verde type yeast. 

-D47 is fine, but it seems to me it needs a bit more age than the 11 series and is more prone to getting that young-wine-sour-ey flavor. It usually will age out fine.

-**I often steer people away from Champagne yeast because if you're just grabbing regular ol' juice off the store shelf and pitch Red Star Champagne or Lalvin 1118 (Champagne) you're going to end up with something that tastes like fizzy soda water.** Not much flavor and very, very dry. It is, however, very possible to create a good cider like this but if you do, and you want it to pop but still have lots of flavor, use fresh juice, and lots of fruit matter to your primary (i.e. apples,  blueberries, blackberries..whatever).




2)**  Malted Cider **

*This type of cider is typically known as a Graff it is a partially malted and usually lightly hopped cider.  As someone who eats beer for three meals a day, I have the authority to say that this is a beer-drinker's cider.  Graff's are wonderful. They give the type of body to a cider most beer drinkers need. It's not wine-ey and it's not too fruity. It's balanced.*

Making your Graff

First Off, **Cider is popular among gluten-free drinkers. If you add malt to your cider, warn others that may be gluten-intolerant.**


-**If you will search “Graff Recipe” you will find a HBT talk thread that will create a dry, mildly sweet and absolutely enjoyable cider. I recommend you start with this recipe if you are curious.** I am am willing to post personal favorite recipes or suggestions, but I'm not going to copy-paste a recipe that is easily searchable and who's author deserves more credit than I.

-On that note, the torrified wheat isn't necessary for head retention. For a base I usually just steep pilsner, white wheat and cyrstal 20 or 60.  I get incredible head retention. 

-**Yeast will contribute nearly the entire character of your cider.** This isn't news for most of you.  Think it through, it will define your drink. The typical S04 will make a dry, slightly tart flavor that is totally enjoyable. I recommend most ale yeasts but I encourage you to experiment. To those unfamiliar with lots of yeast, do a little research or simply start with typical yeasts. WLP001,002,013 are always good places to start. I have done a graff with Saison yeast and it was like nothing I've ever had. Almost more cirtus-ey than apple-ey. But it was a hit on New Years.  I would, however, avoid yeasts that are notorious for generating lots of isoamyl acetate. To me, those banana flavors just clash with the apple. You may have a different opinion. 

-**The guidelines posted in the typical Graff Recipe call for a specific amount of hops and say “if you want to change the hops, use less, not more”.  For all intents and purposes, I will stick to this advice.** If you just want a typical dry cider, the suggested .5oz Cascade boiled for 30 minutes with your malt is perfect. For those of you mildly experienced, you'll probably realize this hop addition is essentially to lightly enhance existing bitterness without creating an overt, or arguably existent at all, aroma. This is correct. I'm never to positive because I'm always adding fruit which makes measuring OG a bit more of a pain, but I think you're aiming for about 7-14 IBU's in five gallons. So if you want to experiment, go for it, but this is really about IBU's, so don't just totally interchange Columbus, Saaz or Cascade without running a calculation. 


3) ** Typical Ciders **

*This is just a typical cider made with no malt and ale yeast. My favorite commercial example would be Harpoon. I believe their cider is probably the best commercial top-fermented cider. I love looking at the back of the bottle... Ingredients: Fermented Apple Juice. There are no secrets with this drink except that they're actually getting fresh juice from an orchard a few miles away from their production, keeping the temperatures maintained and using an ale yeast similar (read identical) to their typical ales.*

-There isn't too much to say here because the process is pretty straightforward. Get your juice or make your must, drop your yeast in. Take gravity readings and bottle.

- - - - - - - - - 

Some questions you may have:

**Do I need to make a starter?**

-*Sigh*. Listen, you don't have to make a starter. You also don't have to tie your shoes, but your day is going to be more difficult if you keep tripping over your laces. Use regular extra-light LME. Yes, you can get away with pitching just a vial or smack pack. Your cider will turn out fine. Making starters is just a good habit to be in.

-Disregard this if you are using dry yeast, and yes, one packet is enough.

**Does temperature matter?**

-Of course it does. If temperatures are an issue for you, choose a yeast appropriate for your range. Focus on esters you want to avoid or create. As a rule of thumb, you can't go wrong around 65F. 


**What if I want to add something to my cider?**

-Then do it, I'm not your mother. I don't really care because you're probably not going to give me any of it anyway. Just search. Someone has added that ingredient and I'm sure wrote about it in detail previously on this sub, HBT, etc. Don't get ambitious. You can always add more, you can't really add less.  


**How long until I can drink it?** 

-How patient are you? For wine yeasts, I usually recommend a **minimum** of 1 month primary and 2 months secondary. Then another 3-8 months in a bottle.  Even with ale-oriented ciders, I usually need a bit of age on my ciders and they will improve with a few extra weeks in a fermenter, especially if you're going to just drop it in a keg and drink it in a week.

-You have to remember that fruit is fairly lazily fermenting, especially if added in secondary. So account for that and give the appropriate time needed, especially if your drink is destined for bottles.

-For ales, give it at least three weeks to secondary, or just five weeks in a primary. Or longer. If I'm not in a hurry I do 1 month primary, 1 month secondary. Why do I secondary? Because I do. Don't argue with me about it. If you don't like it, don't do it. I also am usually adding extra juice or fruit to secondary so it's nicer to siphon-on than dump-in.  


**I want to have a sweet, carbonated cider, but I don't want to backsweeten with lactose or splenda, what do I do?**

It depends on whether you bottle or keg


**If you keg. It's easy. You can kill your yeast and add whatever you want.** I usually drink a few glasses back and then add a half gallon of juice to the 4ish gallons remaining. Do you need to add sorbate? I get away with not doing it by keeping everything cold enough, especially when you add new juice.  If your keg is going to get warm, add the sorbate. I haven't had problems with off-flavors. But make sure you add enough. Aggressive yeasts can maintain plenty of activity if the concentration of sorbate isn't high enough.

-Original Sin is a very unique cider created by fermenting with champagne yeast, killing it with sorbate before it ferments out entirely and lightly carbonated. Give it a try if you can get your hands on it. It's got quite an interesting mouthfeel and I actually enjoy it.

**If you bottle, it's more tricky, but not impossible**. 

-When using wine yeast. Primary in one jug. Let it ferment out. Then split it in half between two secondary fermenters half-filled with fresh, non-fermented juice. You will retain much more sweetness this way. And hey dude, now you have twice the cider! It's like magic that gets you drunk. 

-When using ale-yeast, the process is essentially the same. But don't entirely split your batch. Just leave a gallon out at primary and add it in secondary.

Ok, *deep breath* I think I covered most of what I want to. I apologize for the wordiness but it's easier for me to type all of this out now and just copy paste it from my history when people ask questions in five days because this inevitably end up buried. 

I encourage you to ask and answer questions. I also encourage you to disagree with me. We all have opinions and this write up is much more from experience and not laboratory science. Technically I'm a scientist, *but not that kind of scientist*.

The community has blossomed into one of the best resources for homebrewing we’ve seen on the internet. Heck, we even enjoy the “how’s my tap handle, and label posts”.

Currently we have anywhere from 25,000 to 50,000 unique page views a day, and sometimes the mod mail is overloaded. Some of you out there with lost posts know what I’m talking about. Being a moderator has been taxing as we all have day jobs, and a real life to live.

Around the time of the last competition when we were looking for awesome sponsors, we were contacted by a rather larger brewery. This brewery, offered some amazing prizes and some ideas. It appears they have quite the social networking department. At first we declined working with them as of their reputation.

Fast forward to now. Giving that we all have lives, and our own beer to brew, the moderators have decided to work with this brewery. We have now associated r/Hombrewing with Budweiser or for you technical folks, InBev. From this day on, we the current mods, will take a back seat to r/Homebrewing and BrewerMod will now handle the day to day. BrewerMod, is from Budweiser’s social network department.

We believe, with the tools and connections BrewerMod within Budweiser we can take this community to the next level. We are currently set up our next AMA with the assistant brewer of Shock Top from Ft. Collins next Thursday April 11th. BrewerMod has also arraigned some amazing prizes for this year’s r/homebrewing competition. With that, feel free to ask any questions and I give the keys to BrewerMod.

OH NO IT'S INFECTED, OH THE HUMANITY!

No. If you sanitized as you're supposed to, what you're looking at is probably a nice, healthy krausen produced by your yeast that is the surefire sign of a healthy Saccharomyces, or brewer's yeast, colony and active fermentation. It could look like any of these:

[exhibit A](http://i.imgur.com/HsGwS)  
[exhibit B](http://i.imgur.com/Bddje)

or after it's fallen some, it could look sort of nasty, like this:

[exhibit C](http://i.imgur.com/alloH)



All of this is normal. Your krausen could be darker or lighter depending on your beer. Your krausen will fall back into the beer more or less depending on the strain you're using, and then you'll know you're well on your way to delicious, delicious homebrew.

the following are infections:

[lactobacillius](http://i.imgur.com/XZoWA.jpg)  
[brettomyces, lacto, &amp; sacc](http://i.imgur.com/FHk9H.jpg)  

that last one is an *intentional* infection for a Flanders Red. But it still goes to show how completely different an infection looks compared to a healthy krausen. 

now go forth, relax, don't worry, and have a home brew! If you sanitized and pitched your yeast, you're not going to be seeing any infections 99% of the time, since a healthy yeast colony will block out anything else that's trying to eat your beer. Every fermentation is different, of course, but by and large, fluffy foamy scummy thing is good!

That being said, I noticed on all Brewer's Best kit recipe sheets they say hops are highly toxic to dogs, so I should know better than to turn my back for even a second. Last night my dog helped me brew(OrangeWit!) and snuck the spent hops out of the garbage. Between finding a bunch of info both credible and not so credible and also talking with the vet I wanted to give you guys a rundown of what I found out about hop-doggycide.


* ingesting hops can trigger malignant hyperthermia in some breeds, especially greyhounds and bulldogs -- although it isn't really *toxic* it just activates the condition.  

* the two main timeframes to be aware of if your dog eats hops: under 10 minutes you can induce vomiting with hydrogen peroxide but dogs are quick digesters so after 10 minutes it's in there. 3-6 hours after eating is the critical time to watch for signs of hyperthermia. If after 8-10 hours nothing is wrong the dog is most likely safe.  

* symptoms of hyperthermia: sets in very quick once it starts! excessive panting; temperature increase of 104+ going up by a degree or two every five minutes: over 108 is a death sentence; hyperactivity combined with muscle stiffness.  

* most of the info on the interwebs about hopsecuting your dog comes from a limited study done 15 years ago - fact is there just isn't a lot of empirical evidence yet but enough people have lost their pets to hops that it's worth being careful.  

* there's a lot of conflicting info out there so be careful. ie: some say pellets are fine but leaf is bad(my vet called bs on this); spent brewed hops are not as harmful as raw(vet said could be true but most dogs leave raw alone and go after wort soaked for the flavor).  

* if you compost your hops, this is where a lot of dogs get access to them.  

* if you have this happen and want to dig up info on the net, pet websites tend to have rehashed versions of the same story about 8 greyhounds in Illinois - better off checking homebrew forums. This is where the 'real-life' experiences are being posted.  

It's been 12 hours now since 'the incident' and my beer is bubbling and my dog seems fine.

After coming home from a relentlessly shitty day at work I decide to have a few quiets just to relax a bit. Because I've not yet got my kegerator parts sorted I'm using my temp controlled freezer as both a home for my kegs and a fermentation chamber for lagering.

I pop open the freezer, glass in hand, thinking I'll have a nice cold glass of the Schneiderweisse Unser Aventenis clone I recently kegged. Instead, what I am faced with is a freezer about three inches deep in dark wheat beer. Somehow the gas line has blown off and every last drop of beer has found it's way out of the keg (I had it on a serious lean to fit everything in there)

I'm gutted and start to take carboys out so I can start cleaning when SLIP! My Vienna lager, covered in sticky beer, slips from my hand and breaks on the concrete floor.

I'm pretty much in tears by now, two whole batches wasted. After about an hour cleaning I sit down to have on of my Leffe Radieuse clones, recently bottled using in some glass Coopers bottles I had bought second hand online. They were full off scum when I picked them up but I spent days with them full of chlorine rinse, scrubbing with a bottle brush and sanitizing. Pour one glass - black bits floating in what is (probably only for another week or two) the best beer I've ever made.

My brewing heart is officially broken.


**UPDATE**

What an awesome response!

Last night was a low point in my brewing career. I can't adequately explain the soul destroying anguish I went through opening up my freezer to find 19 litres of sweet banana/clove smelling wheat beer looking up at me, nor the hours that followed where I lost another 40 odd litres.

Suffice to say, yesterday could have been the breaking of me were it not for the fantastic responses here on the forum. Cheers guys, massively appreciated.

So instead of just throwing everything in the bin and wiping my hands of this whole thing, I've decided that this weekend is going to be the one when I turn my brewing around for the better.

I'll be churning out three of my favourites - beers that I've loved and have been winners with everyone I've given them to: Fresh Squeezed IPA, a Yeastie Boys Pot Kettle Black clone and Jamil's Bohemian Pilsner.

As DeSanti has so eloquently put it ""You shall brew victory, my friend.""

Yes, I shall, and it begins now. Thanks again everyone, into it!",,False,self,t5_2qj8u,1366148783.0,,,True,t3_1cgbld,http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1cgbld/my_worst_beer_day_to_date/,

I will improve my sparging when I finally have more than one pot and I can circulate my wort. I will probably even get a false bottom in my mash device of choice. 

But right now, today? I have my dunkel aging (a lazy mans decoction anybody?), two hard ciders (bottling one next week), and I'll have four batches worth of California lager yeast available for future batches (stout and marzen plus whatever my buddy wants to make). I have almost all the pieces to keep three beers on tap at all time and enough kegs to have one on deck at all times. I have dedicated brewing buddies, a fun online forum where I even had the top post one time. 

I don't plan on competing any time soon (might try and become a certified beer judge though) and I don't pretend like I'm the king of beer or the best thing that ever happened to home brewing.

My fiancé is painfully recovering from full thickness burns stretching across his chest, stomach, and back.  We had just finished setting up the new rig (Blichmann top tier) and he was stoked.  We planned to get through 7 beers that weekend.  He *should* have gotten the big ladder from the storage unit, but he was just so excited.  

He was checking temp on the hot liquor tank but since he was just using a small step-stool, he had to lean in close.  His shirt caught fire.  Luckily we were brewing next to the spigot outside, and I was able to hose him down, but unfortunately not fast enough to prevent him from injury.

If you set up your brewery right and follow a few simple steps each time you brew, your odds of getting burned are very low. Avoiding burns while homebrewing involves using common sense. It’s likely that none of the following will surprise you, but since the consequences of forgetting these preventive measures can be severe, it’s worth reviewing them.

* **Wear proper attire when brewing**

I plan to purchase a flame-retardant apron for my betrothed before he's able to brew again.  For under $30, you can find a variety on Amazon.  Search for ""Welding Apron"".   
You should wear rubber boots if you brew in large-enough volumes that a spill could get deeper than the soles of your shoes. For 5-gallon batches of beer, boots would be overkill, but for homebrewers making 10-gallon batches it's worth considering. 
Further, hot metal looks just like cold metal so don’t touch any metal surface that has recently been heated. Use a pot-holder or heat-resistant gloves. 

* **Take care when lighting the burners**

Make sure your fire-starter works when lighting propane burners. Don’t wait until the gas is on to find out the lighter is stubborn. If you don’t get the burner to go within 5 seconds or so, shut off the gas, wait a minute, and try again.

* **Avoid tripping hazards**

Set up your brewery so you won’t have to step over or duck under anything connected to a heat source or a container of hot liquid. Typically, there’s a lot of piping and tubing involved in homebrewing. If you get snagged on any of it and tip something over on yourself, you’ll have to worry about disentangling yourself in addition to potentially getting burned. 

* **If you can stand it, brew with a buddy**

I know a lot of brewers enjoy doing so alone, but if you know someone familiar with the hobby (or you can teach someone willing to learn), it's best to have another pair of eyes &amp; hands to help.  Or at least someone to hang out with you in case the worst happens.  If I weren't around when my plighted set ablaze, it would likely have been much worse.  Which leads me to...

* **Always have a clear path to a cold water source**

If you do get burned, you will need to have access to cold water quickly. Make sure your path to a cold water source is uncluttered so you don’t have to step over or duck under anything, as it’s hard to maintain a long string of expletives when navigating an obstacle course.  If your cold water source is a sink, keep it clear of dirty brewing equipment so you can quickly douse a flame or cool a burned area.  Stop, drop and roll didn't work for my better half (but that shouldn't stop you from trying this method) and it wasn't until after what seemed like forever that I put two and two together and rushed to the hose.  

* **Whenever possible, use gravity or a pump to move hot water or wort**

Carrying large volumes of hot water or wort is dangerous. You should never carry any container of hot water that is too heavy to easily manage. If possible, transfer hot liquids by gravity or pumps. A three-tiered system with propane burners for each vessel ensures that you won’t need to lug hot liquids around. Gravity will do that for you. Alternately, high-temperature pumps can be used to move water or wort between vessels. It’s easier and safer to bring your wort chiller to your wort than to bring your wort to your chiller. And always make sure your valves are closed before you start filling or moving a kettle. 

* **Use common sense**

Pay attention to what you're doing.  
Have a fire extinguisher handy.  
Only use propane in well-ventilated areas.  
Install a carbon monoxide detector.  
Don't put hot liquid into glass carboys.  
Make sure your hands aren't wet when moving those carboys.  
Don't brew naked.  
Limit your alcohol consumption until after the brew is finished.  
Keep a first aid kit handy.

Since subscribing to this subreddit I have been constantly impressed by the encouragement and general goodwill shown by all contributors.

In particular, there is no snobbery, sarcasm or negativity.  All brewers are treated equally, whether they are first time kit brewers, experienced all grain brewers, wine brewers, whatever.  

For some reason I thought that not being all all grain beer brewer could be sneered upon by others who are.  But not so.  All brewers are treated with respect and questions are answered constructively and expertly, with not a hint of condescension.

This is the best online community I have been part of.  Compared to the IT forums I frequent as part of my job, which are often littered with obnoxious know-it-alls, this place is a breath of fresh air and I love reading and learning on here.

So, cheers to you all!!!

AMA!,Injun,259,39,239,http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/t3otl/iama_real_pro_brewer_who_has_proof_and_everything/,"First, here's proof! [http://imgur.com/X5SI8](http://imgur.com/X5SI8) (I was trying to mimic my driver's licence picture. It was a pretty bad day.)

I was going to hijack that other AMA because the OP never showed but I think this avoids confusion.

I still do my own homebrewing in a way. We have a 10 gallon small batch system that we invite local homebrewers to brew on and we put the beer  on tap in the tap room. We provide all of the ingredients while they provide the ideas. I also brew on the system all the time.

We also host Big Brew every year. This year we're shooting for 200 gallons!

Additionally our brewery has a barrel aging program and we convinced the owner of the brewery to buy an extra chardonnay barrel for the homebrew club to fill with whatever we want! 10 of us are each going to brew 5 gallons of the same Tripel recipe and age it!

These are just the things I'm doing that are specific to homebrewing, but Ask Me Anything! I know everything about production brewery operations and a little of the business. 

We'll also be entering Pro-Am at GABF this year with a beer I collaborated on with a fellow homebrewer.

My instructions will include where to buy your equipment and supplies (hardware store, online, LBHS) for the best value and what to do with it so you can make your first batch of beer. Anyone else looking for something like that? I'd be happy to share them for a little feedback. 

EDIT:
This Groupon Deal is a better deal than the DIY because it includes ingredients. Didn't do the math yet, but ballpark DIY costs low $50s. [Affliate Link](http://www.groupon.com//raf/UserReferral_rp/121015/10r1act/lk/uu4308956), [Non Affiliate Link](http://www.groupon.com/deals/midwest-hydroponic-and-homebrewing-supplies-llc). I called and confirmed they will honor the groupon when you place the order over the phone and you pay shipping. Didn't ask if they'll do international (someone want to find out for us?)

In the meantime, I'll try to publish DIY instructions ~~tomorrow~~ by the end of the week (currently slammed at work)... If you're curious, my instructions are cheaper than most starter kits because Lowe's now sells [cheap food grade plastic buckets](http://www.lowes.com/ProductDisplay?partNumber=356492-1152-50640&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10151&amp;productId=3694238&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;cmRelshp=req&amp;rel=nofollow&amp;cId=PDIO1) which used to be hard to find inexpensively. Downside is they're 5 gallons vs most kit's 6.5 gallons... but this might not matter if you're just getting started on your first couple batches. Because it is much easier stomaching 30 bottles of ""only ok"" homebrew vs 48 if your first batch doesn't turn out perfect.

I sent them $800 to build a stainless brewing bench back in September.  They said it would take a while, which I was okay with at the time, since I was building a house.  January comes around and I got the run around until they basically stopped communicating with me altogether.  I've tried to get paypal to help but they say it's past 45 days, which is sort of the nature of the product.  When disputing with paypal, brewers equipment said they were resolving it, which they've not done.  

At this point I'd like my money back, but I'm probably going to have to take them to small claims.  I'd just like to warn the homebrewing community of this company.  Some people have had success, but it's kind of like russian roulette at this point.

1333117989.0,180,self.Homebrewing,rky9h,The Federal licensing process,PKLKickballer,226,46,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/rky9h/the_federal_licensing_process/,"I mentioned in another post that I just got my Federal commercial brewing license.  Someone mentioned that I should outline the process, so here goes!  I worked with some partners on this, so I wasn't always directly involved with some small steps the process, but as president and majority owner, I know most of what went on.  This is also for a brewery in Rhode Island, and may vary in other states.

**Part 1 - Start a business**

The context of the application (Brewer's Notice) is that you already have an existing business.

1. Register as an LLC or Corporation.  My brewery registered as an LLC, which involved a trip to my city hall, $50 and filling out a form.  You then get registered with the state automatically.  At this point you will need to decide if you want to be taxed as a partnership or corporation.

2. Get an Employer Identification Number (EIN).  I believe this is done through the IRS, but a partner/our accountant handled this.

3. Write up a set of bylaws and an operating agreement.  These are very similar and we rolled them into one document.  If you do it that way, you will have to make a note of it in your application package.  These rules will describe the company, how it is owned, how voting is done, how ownership is transferred, and plenty more.  You can download boilerplate documents online, but should spend a good amount of time making them specific to your business.  In my case we have five co-owners and this was the hardest part of the process.  We had to figure out how to divide ownership and what a given type of contribution is worth in that regard.

4. Hold a meeting, with recorded minutes, where you nominate and elect your officers (president, secretary and treasurer).

4. Open a business checking account.  Not much to say here, but you will need one for the application.

5. Obtain a space.  In theory, you don't technically *need* to have one, but you'll have to answer a lot of specific questions about your brewery and I can't imagine being able to do so without the thing actually existing.

6. Get an insurance policy.  This is a good idea in general since you will have valuable equipment and potential liability.  In addition though, you will need to obtain some bonds, and most insurance companies will only issue these to existing clients.  I was able to start a policy and apply for bonds on the same day.

Okay, you are now in the business of doing nothing!  Now it's time for

**Part 2 - Build your application package**

1. Visit [TTB.gov](http://www.ttb.gov) to read up on what you want to do, and to download the assorted forms.

2. The main form to be filled out is the Brewer's Notice.  This is the actual application.  There is plenty more to do, but that is all considered addition documentation.  The notice asks for basic contact information, the address of the brewery (see, you already need to have the place obtained!), what type of business you are, the amount of beer you expect to produce (there are a few wide ranges) and a list of company officials.

3. Fill out ""Personnel Questionnaires"".  These are a basic background check on all members of your company.  You'll be asked about contact information, SSN, place of birth, parent's names, if you've ever been arrested, citizenship, past addresses, past employers, references and a bank reference for each member of the company.

4. Fill out the Environmental Information form.  Here you make your best guesses as to how much of any chemical you'll use, how much energy you'll use, and what waste products you will create.  I made a somewhat educated guess, but wasn't really asked about it in the phone interview.

5. Fill out the Water Quality Considerations form.  Again, best guesses and not a lot of scrutiny.

6. Fill out the Signing Authority form... this is the members who will be allowed to sign documents on behalf of the company.  This form (and possibly others) requires either a corporate seal or the minutes from a meeting that show the election of officers (remember that from part 1?)

7. In addition to all of those forms, you will need to include a bunch of other documents and paperwork.  This includes your Articles of Incorporation (created when you created the business and available at the Sec of State), the bylaws you created, a diagram of your brewery, photo ID (photocopy) of the person filing, minutes of the meeting to elect officers, brewer's bond in duplicate (provided by insurance agent), bank statements from the business account, lease agreement (needs to specifically state that brewing is allowed on premises), Certificate of Zoning Compliance (available from your city hall), legal description of the property (available at city hall).

8. You'll need to create a security statement.  This details entries and exits, security, alarms, hours of operation, etc.  They don't require a high level of security, but just want to know what you have.  They said it was in case they need to raid... not sure if that was a joke!

9. Create a Trade Name Statement.  This can be one sentence stating the name you'll be selling beer under.  It's probably the same as your business name, but I suppose it could be different (eg Boston Brewing Co. uses the trade name Sam Adams).

10. If you have your bylaws and operating agreement rolled into one document, create a document titled ""Operating Agreement"" and note that this is defined in the included bylaws.

11. Create a statement with the names of the banks members have used to contribute any funds to the company.

Once you have all of this stuff, bundle it up and ship it off to the TTB.  If you left anything out, you'll get it back quite quickly with a list of corrections and missing information.  If you don't hear back, call in and schedule a phone interview.  They are actually very helpful and totally on your side.  In my interview, they simply went through a few corrections, all of which I was able to do verbally over the phone.  I received a call less than a week later letting me know that it was approved and an email was to be sent out immediately, followed by original copies of the documentation in the mail.

A few tips:

 - To get things moving more quickly, start off with just one owner, at least on paper.  Our longest waits were for everyone to finish some form or another.  Some of these were for the brewery application itself, and others were required for the bond application(s).  Get licensed, then do the paperwork to add people in as owners/members.

 - Include people who know something about business and business law.  I am fortunate to have a friend who manages a restaurant chain and one who is a corporate accountant.  They helped me make much more informed decisions throughout the process. 

 - Take your time on the bylaws/operating agreement.  We really had to do some creative thinking to work out a way to allocate ownership and to allow that to change as time went on.  When we wrote it up, we had a head brewer who had great recipes but nothing material to contribute and a friend with no relevant skills, but a chunk of cash to invest in exchange for partial ownership.  We came up with a way for things like that to be valued fairly.  After a lot of negotiating and some briefly strained friendships, the finished document has held up and already provided guidance for changes that have been made.

Head on over to [reddithomebrewing.com](http://reddithomebrewing.com/) to signup as a participant. Bookmark this post -- all updates will be added to this announcement as time goes on.

--musashiXXX

**EDIT #1** The contest will feature the following style categories:

* BJCP 10A. American Pale Ale
* BJCP 16C. Saison
* BJCP 7B. California Common
* BJCP 19. Barleywine
* BJCP 5. Bock

**If you plan on participating in the APA (BJCP 10A. American Pale Ale) category...**

This is the first year we're having an ""international"" competition: the APA category (BJCP 10A. American Pale Ale) is going to be judged by our Canadian judge: [KFBass](http://reddit.com/user/KFBass). This means that you shouldn't enter unless you:

* live in Canada
* do not live in Canada but you are able/willing to ship to Canada

The rest of the categories will be judged in the U.S. so you shouldn't enter these categories unless you:

* live in the U.S.
* do not live in the U.S. but are able/willing to ship to the U.S.

**Remember:** It is illegal to ship alcoholic beverages in many countries via the postal service. You will have to use a private carrier such as (but not limited to) FedEx, UPS, and/or DHL


**EDIT #2** Tentatively, the cutoff for signups is October 15 (6 months from today). Unless you have a good alibi your entries _must_ be postmarked by that date in order to qualify.

**EDIT #3** Submissions must be in the form of two (2) bottles, at least 12oz each (we're not going to complain if you send two 22oz bottles). We ask for two in case something happens to one of them; it's pretty rare to have two bottle bombs in the same package and/or to have both become uncapped in transit.

**EDIT #4** Three judges have been confirmed:

* [mjap52](http://www.reddit.com/user/Mjap52) - Saison
* Denny Conn - Bock
* [KFBass](http://www.reddit.com/user/KFBass) - APA (Canada)

**EDIT #5** Final list of judges:

* [mjap52](http://www.reddit.com/user/Mjap52) - Saison
* Denny Conn - Bock
* [KFBass](http://www.reddit.com/user/KFBass) - APA (Canada)
* [Endlesswinter77](http://www.reddit.com/user/endlesswinter77) - Barleywine
* [cockold](http://www.reddit.com/user/cockold) - California Common

It appears that most of us here at r/homebrewing have been brewing for quite some time and are pretty serious about it. I see a lot of passion and pride in each posting of a new brew. Perhaps we can come together to bring our BEST recipes to the table for a Reddit Homebrew Book. I realize there is a recipe section/thread but I would bet that if we take a few weeks and really work together on this we could come up with an amazing resource.

Here are some initial thoughts on how this might go:

* take some time to discuss and come to a consensus on the process.
* set a time frame for submitting your favorite ""best-of-the-best"" recipe
* structure the book so as to cater to both beginner and advanced skill level. Perhaps we break it up into two sections: All Grain &amp; Extract/Partial Mash
* Set a limit for each beer style, (perhaps 5?). Ex: 5 IPA, 5 Pale. 5 Stout etc..
* Create a standardized template for each recipe to ensure consistency (and to make it pretty). I know there are many templates out there for homebrew recipes.
* Once all submissions have been made a panel of ""editors"" (perhaps the Mods) Will analyze the recipes for accuracy/correctness and the book will be published. We can publish a nice PDF, or if there is enough interest maybe there will be an option for a hard copy.

Thoughts?

**Update** This is exciting to see so much interest. It appears we need a consensus for the recipe format. BeerXML is popular but there is still a question of how to display it on a page in the book (layout). [This](http://www.brew-monkey.com/recipes/html/caplager.htm) kind of layout may work

It looks like it may be best method of submission may be via an external website. I have the means to get a simple site up and running to get us started.

I don't see the 2011 winners having a recipe posted. Its possible that not everyone will be willing to share their recipe. We may just need to ping the winners of the last contest to see if they would be willing to share.

**Update 2** There is quite a bit of interest to expand this beyond a simple PDF. Perhaps we can start with compiling some great recipes for a Vol. 1 book and morph that into a website as needed.

I wasn't planning to order quite yet - I won't be brewing again for another three weeks - but free is free.

The only issue was that AHS happened to be out of German pilsner.  I'm brewing an Oktoberfest, so this was a bummer.  I figured that I would sub in Belgian pils... but it was also out of stock.

In addition, both caramunich and carapils were also out of stock.

We're talking about almost half of my grain bill being unavailable.  I would have to add in extra stuff to still qualify for free shipping, and I wouldn't have everything that I needed, anyway.

So, last night, I sent them an email.  Explained what had happened.  Asked if there was any way that I could make the order now and just have them hold it until everything was in stock.  After all, I'd hate to miss the free shipping deal.

They responded to me this morning with an apology.  They mentioned that their sales were up enough to throw off their ordering schedule, and while that was a nice problem to have, it was frustrating for their customers.  They had placed some rush orders for grain, but it would be a week or so before those were in.

They told me that they couldn't take an online order for items that were out of stock, but they did include a coupon code in the email for $6.99 off - in other words, for free shipping.

(x-post from r/firewater),RandyMarshCT,250,80,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1gstxy/petition_to_legalize_home_distilling_please_help/,"Hello everyone. I apologize for posting a somewhat unrelated topic, but my love for home brewing has progressed over the years to include small-scale artisan distilling. Many in our home distilling community want to be able to practice our hobby openly and legally. We want to teach others and learn more and take our craft where the home brewing craft has gone since it was legalized in 1978.



This is a link to a petition to legalize home distilling. I didn't start the petition, but I'm trying to help get signatures because it's a cause I deeply believe in. I understand that some people have reservations about signing a petition due to activities they participate in. If you are nervous about signing then do the next best thing: get someone you know who doesn't participate in questionable activities to sign it. Someone who has nothing to hide. I signed it and I got 10 other people to. If everyone would do this we could get 10,000 signatures no problem. Just imagine being able to go to a function where people who build stills and sell distilling equipment could meet with home distillers and try spirits and compare designs and recipes. Where you could have contests and enter your spirits for tastings and see how they hold up to everyone else's. Wouldn't that be totally awesome?!? This needs to be the next step. Please consider signing this petition and please consider asking anyone else you know that might be willing to sign it as well. Thank you in advance for your help!

1330751149.0,168,self.Homebrewing,qfjwb,"By request, a quick look at the time dependence of sanitization techniques.",klenow,198,30,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/qfjwb/by_request_a_quick_look_at_the_time_dependence_of/,"Earlier this week, KineticSolution asked /r/askscience a [question](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/qbswl/sanitation_question_for_you_microbiologists_here/), so I figured what the hell. I'm a scientist and an avid homebrewer. I work with tissue culture and pathogens, so sanitization is very near and dear to my heart both professionally and as a hobbyist. 

So I tried to answer the age-old question: How long does it take to sanitize my stuff? This quick experiment has some serious limitations, however, and I will review them at the end. But first, what I did.

I grew up some *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (a common bacterium found just about everywhere) overnight in LB. LB is a standard growth medium for bacteria; it comes in liquid (broth) and solid (agar) forms. I took some of this culutre and contaminated some things:

First, some glass coverslips. I put 200uL (microliters) of the culture on each of 8 coverslips. I then put them in a warm room to dry.

I also took some plastic culture tubes and filled them with 2 mL clean LB broth each and put 200uL of the overnight culture into each (1:10 dilution). I put these in the warm room to grow for 6 hours. At the end, I had a bunch of contaminated [stuff](http://i.imgur.com/fhuTs.jpg).

I then treated each slide or tube. For the slides, I made a bath of 0.5% phosphoric acid (my StarSan analog) or 5% bleach (v/v) and put 8 different coverslips into it. 

1 - just dunked in 0.5% phosphoric acid

2 - submerged for 1 minute in 0.5% phosphoric acid

3 - submerged for 5 minutes in 0.5% phosphoric acid

4 - submerged for 10 minutes in 0.5% phosphoric acid

5 - just dunked in 5% bleach

6 - submerged for 1 minute in 5% bleach

7 - submerged for 10 minutes in 5% bleach

8 - nothing

I then took all 8 coverslips and rinsed them with 10mL of tap water. I placed each one on an LB-agar plate, contaminated side down, and let them sit for 1 hour. I then removed the coverslip and put the plates in the warm room to grow overnight.

Then I treated the tubes. First, I poured out the culture from each tube. Then I treated them:

1 - just fill, then dump out 0.5% phosphoric acid

2 - Fill with 0.5% phosphoric acid, leave for 1 minute, then pour out.

3 - Fill with 0.5% phosphoric acid, leave for 5 minutes, then pour out.

4 - Fill with 0.5% phosphoric acid, leave for 10 minutes, then pour out.

5 - just fill, then dump out 5% bleach

6 - Fill with 5% bleach, leave for 1 minute, then pour out.

7 - Fill with 5% bleach, leave for 10 minutes, then pour out.

8 - rinse with 5x volumes of tap water

The phosphoric acid tubes got no further treatment. Bleach tubes were each rinsed with 5 volumes of tap water. This was actually very interesting...the phosphoric acid was so dilute I didn't expect it to do much, but as soon as I put the coverslips in the solution, the dried on bugs got ripped apart. The slides looked clean after treatment.

I then put 2mL of sterile media in each tube and put them in the warm room overnight to grow.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/bVXyW.jpg) is a bit of an idea of what we're talking about here.

The results were not as exciting as I had hoped. The only [plate](http://i.imgur.com/2eIMD.jpg) that grew anything was #8; the one that just got rinsed off with water. The rest were just as blank as the right side of that plate, so I didn't take pictures. But this is good; the water rinse was my control, so getting colonies there means the assay works...it's not terribly sensitive, but it works.

[Tubes](http://i.imgur.com/XPspM.jpg) were a little better. Two grew stuff. As expected, the one that was only rinsed with water grew quite well. The one that got a quick StarSan-simulant rinse also grew stuff, but one minute in it cleaned the tube quite well. This tells us two things : One, remnants of StarSan left in a tube will not inibit growth. Second, one minute is enough to kill common bacteria.

Now....the limitations. First, this is only bacteria, and it's a lab strain; lab strains are generally considered ""weaker"" than environmental strains, but in this study what they lack in quality they make up in quantity. These tubes would have had ~200,000,000+ bacteria in each of them. *Pseudomonas* is a pretty good model for your general bugs you'll find around the home. It's relatively hardy (even the lab strain is relatively hardy), it's damn near everywhere, and it's kind of the jack-of-all-trades bug. But this is not testing for activity against molds. Other stuff, too, but most importantly molds. 

Second, my StarSan analog is NOT complete StarSan. It's just the phosphoric acid part. The surfactant that's in there will also have some pretty serious effects on the bugs, and amplify the acivity of the phosporic acid. The good thing about this is that my StarSan-like stuff is weaker than real StarSan; if mine cleans in 1 minute, you can be damn sure the real stuff does.

So, in conclusion, it seems that a 1 minute incubation with StarSan is sufficient to clean your gear. It's possible that a quick rinse would do it...but I'd stick with a minute. 

That's it. I'm sure there are other caveats, etc. Please bear in mind this is not difinitive, it's little more than screwing around, but hey...it's fun to screw around.

Let's convince them to help out homebrewers!,auralvance,177,19,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/fmgkd/jack_daniel_distillery_looking_for_ideas_on_what/,"A few weeks back I received a letter from the warehouse supervisor at JD looking for fresh ideas on what to do with the huge amount of used barrels they accumulate throughout the year. The barrels are only used once to mature the whiskey and then they are either recycled or destroyed. Being a homebrewer, the first thing that came to mind was ""How do I get one?!""

I've since written an email back and suggested they start a website and/or program to offer them up to homebrewers and any other interested parties who are willing to cover whatever handling costs there are. They could even chop them up into chips to make for easy shipping and additions to fermenters, rather than actually ageing in the full barrel (I'm assuming they're large).

Anyway, I thought some other reddit homebrewers might be interested and would like to drop them a line.

Contact Phil Whitaker (phil_whitaker@tennesseesquires.com) with any ideas.

Edit: Also, I forgot to mention they're also looking for ideas on what to do with the barrel's metal bands if anyone can think of something.",,False,self,t5_2qj8u,True,,,True,t3_fmgkd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/fmgkd/jack_daniel_distillery_looking_for_ideas_on_what/,

5 gal Indian Summer Apple Cider
1.67 lbs White Sage Honey
1.67 lbs Crystal Light Brown Sugar
5 tsp. Yeast Nutrient
2.5 tsp. Yeast Energizer
White Labs 775 English Cider Yeast
OG: 13.5 brix/1.054 sg

The trick with store bought apple juice is that it has to be unpreserved in order to ferment. As long as the ingredient list doesn't say Sodium Benzoate or Potassium Sorbate (or some other preservative) you're good to go. 

I made a simple syrup out of the sugar and honey by boiling it in a small amount of water for about 5 minutes to sterilize it. Other than that, I just poured everything in the carboy, pitched the yeast and called it a day.

* All yeast strains are not created equal. Some are vigorous and some will look like they are doing nothing at all. When in doubt, take a reading.
* Sanitizing everything is very important, but the beer will be fine if you forget something.
* It takes a lot to actually ruin a beer. Chances are yours will turn out fine. Maybe even great.
* Don't give up on a beer if it doesn't impress you at bottling. Give it a couple of weeks. You will be surprised.

I went on craigslist and somebody had 500 empty amber bottles (for homebrewing) for FREE! I went to pick up 200 of them the next day from a nice house.  

An older couple answered the door and led us to the basement.  The person I had emailed (a female) was not home.  She was the older couple's daughter-in-law.  Well after we loaded up a few boxes of bottles, we figured out from our conversation with the older couple that their son had just recently died... And this was all of his homebrew stuff.  He had like 15 kegs, multiple CO2 bottles, kettles, wine making stuff, and a ton of stuff I had never seen before.  Anyway, on the way out of the house on our trips to the car, we noticed the funeral flowers all over the house...

So I get home and I'm unloading/organizing the bottles and I come across three full bottles.  It says something ""----- ale"" on top, but I don't remember what it says.  All of the bottles are dusty as hell and must have been in there awhile.  

I'm kind of curious to try the beer, but I almost feel bad or weird drinking it.  What should I do?

I can post pictures of the bottles later if there is any interest.

UPDATE: Thanks for all of the comments!  I just took all of your advice and emailed his wife and offered to send his wife and parents a bottle if they would like it.  I'll keep you updated.  I hope it will cheer her up.  I'll also post a picture when I get home.  I think I'm going to stick the other bottle in the fridge when I get home and try it tonight.

UPDATE 2: Leaving work now (1615 EST)... Will post a picture of the bottles when I get home and put one in the fridge!

UPDATE 3:Sorry it took me so long.  I had to go to Costco and cook dinner.  Here are 2 pics of the beers.  He named it ""Nostradamus Ale""  http://imgur.com/a/rGN8g

Sadly i work early. Leave more specific job related questions, I can ask them at work tmrw and get back to you when I get in.

Here we go. First a glossary. *HLT* is Hot liquor Tank. *CLT* is cold liquor tank. *MLT* is mash/lauter tun. *WP* is whirlpool. *HE* heat exchanger. *AV* aging vessel, *FV* fermenting vessel. *BBT* brite beer tank. I am making the assumption i dont have to explain common brewing terms like mash or sparge. Also, im Canadian. SO we deal in Hectoliters, Celsius, and KGs.

*ME!* I'm 24, male, been homebrewing for about 2 years now. I got the job as a ""brewery assistant"" through applying online. I did not study anything to do with brewing, chemistry, biology, or engineering in college. In fact I studied Jazz Bass performance so you can imagine how useful that is. My brewmaster must've seen something special in me or took pity, either way I'll take it.

The brewery does 20HL batches 2x a day. It's a team of 4 people plus the brewmaster not counting forktruck drivers or warehouse people. Sometimes we can push out 3 brews a day if we have one guy start early and one guy stay later. Another thing, we also make and pasteurize wort for homebrew and brew on premise type situations. Since most people will never do that in their careers i'll leave the details of that out.

The day breaks down to two types of people. Assistants, and Brewer. It's a very small team so everyone eventually is trained to work the brewhouse.

I'll start with Assistants. Get into work, first thing anybody does is turn on lights and unlock doors. If the brewer isnt in you setup and turn on the various control panels and fittings so when they get in then can just deliver water and go. After that you replenish the footbaths with iodine solution and close/pressurize any tanks that have been purging with co2 overnight. Then it splits off. One guy runs the filter and one guy does various tasks. 

before starting the filter confirm it was sanitized, if it wasnt, sanitize it! Setting up the filter requires layering different grades of Diatomaceous earth over a screen to create a filter bed. This takes about an hour. ONce that is all setup, we pressurize a tank to 15psi, punch out the yeast at the bottom. Sometimes we collect said yeast in a bucket for future use, sometimes not depends on the brew and generation. once all that is done and hooked up to the filter you dose DE powder inline with the incomming beer which helps disperse it through the filter bed. Downstream whatever DE is leftover in the now brite beer is caught in a 5 micron trap filter (which by observing the pressure differential you can determine if the trap needs changing). usually by the time the filter run has started it is time for the first digout. 

Digging out the mashtun is dome semi manually. We turn on the mash rakes, and let the grain fall out the door into a big bucket which I and another dude usually lift into a dumpster about waist high. Proper lifting technique is essential as these buckets can weight anywhere between 40-100lbs. We scrape out whatever we can with a handheld rake, and use a high pressure hose to spray out most of the rest. Usually then its break time! 

After break, I observe the level of DE left in the filter dosing tank, and how much beer has been filtered and make judgement call to weigh out more powders as needed. IF I dont need to, now is a really good time to clean up the powder area, and clean out my buckets or maybe assist the other guy in sanitizing some tanks/perform some maintenance. 

Once the filter run is done (usually a HL every 1-2min x40HL = before lunch) you throw it into a loop, and shut the filter down. CO2 is used to push any remaining product out and into the tank. The tank I just came from is then vented, sprayed down and rinsed for 30mins with cold water to flush out any remaining co2. The cooling is turned off and the tank is connected to a pump to start caustic cycle. The flow pathway is this: tank outlet&gt;pump inlet&gt;pump outlet&gt;tank sprayball arm&gt;tank outlet. once the tank is heated sufficiently by flushing hot water through it, caustic is added and looped through the tank for x amount of minutes. it's then rinsed, rinsed again by hand and disconnected from the pump to setup for the next tank. Usually during this time the second digout will have happened.

Then the filter needs cleaning, which is done with a big hose, then again detailed with a smaller hose and back flushed. if you have time right then, you can start refilling the filter and sanitizing it.

During this whole time a second guy is running aorund performing various maintenence tasks (like detail cleaning the bottling line, swapping out valves in tanks etc..) or santizing tanks. This takes a fair bit of balancing and variability. a lot of communication goes on to ensure everyone knows what everyone else is doing, digouts are done on time etc.... THe second man is also responsible to dump the specialty grains for the brewer and weigh out the next brews grains. This is essential as the brewhouse takes precedence.

I almost forgot to mention getting inside the mash tun. Once a day, one person has to get inside and clean out by hand the mash tun. It's kind of a shitty job because you get soaking wet, but everyone has to do it so its a necessary evil.

near the end of the day, all the parts that have touched product are put into a bucket of caustic, rinsed, then put into a bucket of sanitizer. All parts are put away, hoses are walked out, then wrapped and hung back up. Basically our tankhouse looks the same when we start every day. We have one of the cleanest breweries ive ever seen, and it is through very frequent communication that we accomplish everything and wrap it all back up nicely by the end of the day.

*Brewer*

The brewer has a completely different day then the tankhouse people. They get in, make sure we are brewing that day, and setup the mash tun to receive hot water from the HLT. ALso very important to recirculate the HLT so that the reading on the probe is accurate. Once the foundation water is delivered, the mash in begins. As stated usually the tankhouse guys will dump the specialty grains. Our grain mill is located directly one floor above the mash tun. 2row is delivered from a silo via auger to the mill, and the tankhouse guys mix specialty grains (down to the kilo) buy hand into the mill. 

We mash for 15mins (I know...15 mins seems redic). After that it's sparge time. we fly sparge for 70mins (also redic). During the 1st bit of the sparge we use graivty, then after that it's a bit of a balancing act between the rate you deliver the sparge water, and the rate the lauter pump draws off the liquid. During all this, the whirlpool is being sanitized, hops are being weighed out, salt additions are weighed out, brewbrite finings are hydrated etc..

Once the liquid in the kettle reaches the volume needed we bring it to a boil and we all know about that I hope. While this boil is started, now is time to fit in a break. After break, hopefully the assistants have done the digout, and you are ready to begin all over again! Somebody dumps specialty grains, the silo and auger do their thing and away we go.

since we have a 3 vessel brewery (MLT, kettle, WP) you generally have to wait for the 1st boil to finish and transfer to the WP before you can start running off the second sparge. This means the second mash usually lasts about 40 mins. Transferring the 1st brew to the WP takes about 20mins. After the transfer is done, you spray out the Kettle, then begin the sparge of the 2nd mash.

we WP for 20mins, then begin the coolout. This involves pumping cold water from the CLT through the HE against the hot wort. It's a bit of a balancing act, since we need to coolout at an appropriate temp to not kill yeast, while still allowing for the now hot water coming out of the HE to be at an appropriate temp to sparge with (every drop counts). this is a fun time of the day involving alot of attention to pump speeds and temps. Always stressful.

after that it's a pretty easy day. lather rinse repeat on the brewing. ONce all the liquids are transfered and cooled out its just cleanup. spray out and Caustic the kettle, caustic and sanitize WP and HE. Clean all your parts, put everything away. then call it a day!

I left out alot of details because every brewhouse is different. Also the spelling and grammatical errors can go suck it. I'm just trying to convey a sense of what a day is like for a brewer. Our brewhouse is very manual, and labour intensive. Kind of a worst case scenario. But a very solid foundation. Also many of the details I may have missed are because they are either second nature now, or I forgot regular people dont know these things as obvious.

Im sure this is going to start a storm, but questions anyone????

A simple definition of brewing is the infusion, boiling and fermentation of various ingredients to make beer.  Central to this definition is that the liquid be boiled; and at least for me boiling the wort is what makes me most feel like a brewer.  But what exactly is the purpose of boiling and why is it necessary?  Boiling accomplishes four main objectives;  development of a color and flavor,  reduction of proteins, sanitization and isomerization of alpha acids.  Lets look at each of these objectives in turn.


**Color and Flavor**

Boiling your wort produces flavor and color compounds through the maillard reaction.  The maillard reaction is the same chemical reaction responsible for the browning of toast and is similar to caramelization.  Caramelization is the reaction that takes place when sugars are exposed to temperatures in excess of 350°F.  The temperature in the boil will not rise much above 212° and as such caramelization can not occur.  What does occur is the maillard reaction that occurs between sugars and amino acids and it can occur at  temperatures achievable in boiling wort.  Maillard compounds can produce a range of flavors, from caramel like to toast.  It is the same reaction that produces colors and flavors in malt during kilning.  Extended boiling times can result in darkening of the wort and the production of malt and caramel type flavors.  In some styles such as Scottish ales, long boil times are used to develop characteristic flavors.


**Reduction of Proteins**

Temperatures reached during boiling cause proteins found in the wort  to denature and then coagulate into larger clumps that can then settle out of the wort.  This makes boiling an effective way to remove proteins that could ultimately cause chill haze in the beer.   You can visually observe this process as the wort first comes to a boil and foam begins to build on top of the wort.  If the pot is too small, or if the reaction is not controlled this can result in a boil over.


**Sanitization**

 From my prior article on working with extracts, I put forth the the proposition that extracts need only be boiled for 15 minutes as the extracts have already been put through a full boil during extract production and therefore have already developed color and flavor compounds, and achieved protein reduction.  (This is not to say that you can't do an extended boil to build flavor and color into the beer.) Therefore your only need to boil the wort in order to sanitize it.  Boiling can be an effective form of sanitization as long as the boil is maintained for at least 15 minutes. Sanitation is not the same as sterilization, which is the reduction of all microorganisms, but a 15 minute minute boil will give you a sufficient level of sanitization so that your choice of yeast is not out competed by wild yeast and bacteria.


**Isomerization of Alpha Acids**

While not the only contributor, hops are a primary contributor of bitterness to beer.  The bittering potential of hops is generally measured by their alpha acid content, with a higher alpha acid measurement indicating more potential bitterness.  Alpha acids are not soluble in water, and in order to extract the bitterness in a form that will dissolve into your beer it is necessary to boil them.  But there is a trade off, as the more volatile compounds responsible for flavor and aroma  will be driven off while boiling. Boiling causes the alpha acids to undergo isomerization, a change in chemical structure producing iso-apha acids that are soluble in water.  The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness that will be extracted  from the hops.  This is why bittering hops are traditionally added at the beginning of the boil.

Go read John Palmer's [Crash Course In Brewing](http://www.howtobrew.com/section1/chapter1.html). It's 5 short pages that walks you through the entire homebrewing process. Also read through the [Glossary](http://www.howtobrew.com/glossary.html) to get a feel for some common terms.

**Sounds good. What equipment do I need?**

Here's what I would recommend:  

 - [6.5 gallon fermenting bucket w/lid](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/6-5-gallon-fermenting-bucket.html) or [6 gallon better bottle](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/better-bottle-plain-6-gallon.html) or [6 gallon carboy](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/6-gallon-glass-carboy.html)  
 - [Thermometer](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/large-dial-thermometer-9-probe.html)  
 - [6.5 gallon bottling bucket](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/brewing-equipment/fermenting-equipment/6-5-gallon-bottling-bucket.html) (read jnish's comment below on how to ferment and bottle in the same carboy/bucket) w/ [spigot](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/bottling-spigot-for-bottling-bucket.html)  
 - [Airlock](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/three-piece-airlock.html)  
 - [Hydrometer](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/thermohydrometer.html)  
 - [Tubing](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/3-8-clear-hi-temp-tubing.html)  
 - [Bottling wand](http://www.homebrewit.com/aisle/p/4861)  
 - [Capper](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/red-baron-emily-capper.html)  
 - [Wine Thief](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/3-piece-thief-plastic.html)
 - About 50 Bottles and [60 caps](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/plain-gold-caps-144-ct.html)
 - Sanitizing solution ([StarSan](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/star-san.html), Iodophor, Bleach)  
 - Large Pot (called a kettle) - 8-10 gallon stainless would be ideal for full boils. I wouldn't pay money for anything smaller than a 20 qt (5-gallon) for partial boils. Aluminum or enamel-coated will work as well. 
 - [Extract recipe kit](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/irish-red-ale.html) including extract, hops, (possibly steeping grains), yeast and priming sugar.  

**That's a lot of stuff. Where should I get it?**

The cheapest way to get everything but the wine thief, sanitizer, kettle and bottles is to stay tuned to r/Homebrewing and wait for [this Groupon](http://www.groupon.com/deals/midwest-homebrewing-akron?sd=false&amp;utm_campaign=UserReferral_dp&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=uu23114927) to come back around. If you don't feel like waiting then you can pay full price for a kit from any of a number of online retailers (check the [Homebrewing Resources](http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/g5dle/homebrewing_resources/) link in the sidebar) or from your local homebrew supply store.

**What about a Mr. Beer kit?**

I wouldn't pay money for one, but if you got one as a present you *can* make a delicious beer with it.

**Any tips to simplify my first beer?**

 - I'd recommend an ale for your first beer as they're typically less work.  
 - Oktoberfest is a delicious beer, however, it is NOT an ale.  
 - Before you start *anything*, set all your stuff out, and take 60 seconds to do a ""dry run"" where you mentally go through every step of the brewing process.  
 - 1 gallon of diluted StarSan is plenty to sanitize everything. If you use distilled water, you can store and reuse that same batch at bottling time.  
 - TAKE AN INITIAL HYDROMETER READING.  
 - I'd use dry yeast for your first beer. Dry yeast is idiot proof: take it out of the fridge (an hour before you need it), tear it open, and sprinkle directly onto your cooled, aerated wort.  
 - Skip secondary fermentation. It's not necessary for a basic ale and skipping it will not affect the quality of your beer in any way. Instead, r/Homebrewing recommends leaving the beer in the primary fermenter for two weeks (one week for fermentation and a second week for conditioning).  
 - Cut a short piece of hose and connect your bottling wand directly to the spigot for one-handed bottling. [Like this](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/gallery/data/1/best954.jpg).

The quickest way to determine what kind of plastic something is made of is by looking at its [recycle code](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Plastic-recyc-01.svg) if it has one.  The breakdown is below:

**RC 1 - polyethylene terepthalate (PET)**

Most commonly seen as plastic coke bottles, this is a form of polyester.  It has high heat resistance and is an excellent oxygen and moisture barrier, making it excellent for homebrewing.  One thing to watch out for, though, is that at high temperatures or sunlight exposure, it can degrade and release potential harmful products like phthalates and heavy metal catalysts.

*tl;dr:  Good properties for homebrewing, but keep out of sunlight and don't pour extremely hot wort into it.  Do not use if it is discolored (yellowed)*


**RC 2 and 4 - high and low density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE)**

Extremely common plastic.  High density (RC 2) is what is used in plastic bottle caps and hardhats.  Low density (RC 4) is what milk jugs are made of.  From a chemical point of view, this is the simplest plastic possible.  This is good because it is pretty much completely inert in your body and poses no health threats.  The downside is that it has limited heat resistance.  RC 4 begins to deform at around 85C (below water's boiling point) and RC 2 begins to deform around 110C (above the boiling point, but I'd still be careful).

*tl;dr:  Excellent from a health point of view, but poor temperature resistance.  Choose RC 2 when possible and do not pour boiling hot wort into it.*


**RC 3 - polyvinyl chloride (PVC)**

This is most commonly seen as PVC pipe, but is used for a wide variety of things.  There are a number of different forms and some are better for homebrewing than others.  As a general guide, the more rigid the plastic is, the safer it is for homebrewing.  In order to make them more flexible, chemicals are added which can leach into your beer and potentially cause problems.  There is still a large amount of debate about the safety of PVC.

*tl;dr: While a useful plastic, there are many forms that can be hard to tell apart.  It may be best to avoid using PVC unless you are confident that the form you have is safe.*


**RC 5 - Polypropylene (PP)**

Very similar in structure to polyethylene, PP is most familiar to homebrewers as the hard plastic used in a flip top bottle. It is also used as the lid for tic-tacs and is the material used in those large plastic barrels.  PP is very chemically inert and does not pose a significant health concern.  It has slightly better heat resistance than polyethylene, but should be kept out of sunlight as this can cause it to degrade.


*tl;dr:  Safe and useful.  Slightly higher melting point than polyethylene.  Keep out of sunlight.*

**RC 6 - Polystyrene (PS)**

Polystyrene is used in a wide variety of places.  It is used to make styrofoam as well as in take-away food containers and plastic flower pots.  It is relatively brittle at room temperature , but begins to get soft at 100C (water's boiling point) and can release styrene monomer when heated.  Styrene monomer has been linked to cancer, but the FDA has approved the use of PS for food packaging claiming that the styrene is at low enough levels to not cause concern.  Personally, I would be uncomfortable heating polystyrene, but you can take whatever risks you would like.

*tl;dr: Brittle at room temperature, melty at boiling temperature, releases cancerous chemical.  Probably best to avoid for homebrewers.*


**RC - 7 Other (most commonly polycarbonate)**

RC-7 is the catch-all for other plastics and tells pretty much nothing about the chemical structure.  The most common plastic seen with RC-7 is polycarbonate (hard nalgene bottles/baby bottles).  This was the plastic that caused the whole BPA scare.  It's generally fine for room temperature liquids, but I would not put hot liquids into it.  That said, I think BPA has been blown out of proportion.

*tl;dr:  This code tells you little.  Generally best to avoid the unknown.*

This is far from an exhaustive guide, but hopefully it will help people be a little bit more confident in their plastic choices.  Please let me know if there are any more specific questions and I will do my best to answer.",,False,self,t5_2qj8u,False,,beginner,True,t3_14u2ge,http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/14u2ge/a_homebrewers_guide_to_plastics/,

Apparently I had stowed it away for a few months of aging and then completely forgot about it.  Popped a bottle open mentally prepared for whatever foulness might come spewing out, but well, it smelled delicious so I poured into a pint glass and took a swig.  After a half-decade of mostly unintentional aging, it's officially the best beer I've made.  The sharper roasted flavors and hop bitterness have become incredibly smooth, it's gained complexity and picked up a touch of that dark-fruit flavor that can only be achieved by the oxidation reactions during long-term aging.

I'm the first to admit it can be really difficult to hold on to a good batch longer than a few weeks, but I just wanted to remind everyone how much your darker and higher gravity brews can significantly improve with bottle conditioning 6-12 months and beyond.  Put away some bottles in a closet and keep coming back to it to see how it ages over a year or two.  You will really thank yourself.

But there are some of us that chose to ignore practicality and chase the dream of starting a brewery. 

Ever since my first batch a couple of years ago, I started planning opening my own brewery. Right away I saw the the challenge ahead and have been working non stop since. It's not just the making beer that draws me to it, but the building of a brand, and being in control. I enrolled in the Siebel Institute this past winter and when I felt my business plan was ready enough started a [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ovalbrewing/the-oval-brewing-company-the-best-damn-beer-in-the). 

The campaign is going great so far, we are a little over halfway through and over 2/3 of the way to our goal. We thought Redditors may want to help, so we came up with a special Reddit Kickstarter reward. 

http://vimeo.com/37571657

[This page](http://ovalbrewing.com/kickstarter-reddit-rewards/) goes into more detail, with an explainer video.

One of the cool things about Kickstarter is it can track where backers originate from… and we thought it would be a great idea to keep track of and thank Reddit backers in a special way. If the total pledges originating from Reddit are $10,000 or over, we will brew and can a beer created by Reddit! You will still get the awesome rewards as non-redditor backers, but you will get the opportunity to help crowd-source one of our first beers.

Another poster suggested that the yeast die during digestion and he gets them even with kegged homebrew so I knew there must be a more scientific explanation.  I did some digging and found [this little bugger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligosaccharide) that is present in our homebrews.

Notice that it is present in green veggies (surprise) as well as maltodextrins or cellodextrins, resulting from the microbial breakdown of larger polysaccharides such as starch or cellulose. BINGO.  

On a good note, they can only be partially digested by humans but act as fuel for the bacteria that keep our intestines healthy.  Just one more reason why homebrew can help keep you healthy!

TL;DR  Homebrew contains an oligosaccharide, which is a saccharide polymer that is only partially digestible and keeps our intestines healthy but makes some of us fart.",,False,self,t5_2qj8u,False,,intermediate,True,t3_sthe8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/sthe8/til_why_i_get_beer_farts/,

When you get started most recipes kits make 5 gallons of beer. **The DIY buckets can only accommodate 4 gallon batches.** But to simplify your first batch of homebrew (and every other batch for that matter) I recommend making two fermenters and putting 4 gallons in one fermenter as the recipe instructs and experimenting with the remaining wort (wort is unfermented beer) in the second fermenter. 

One nice part of getting into Homebrew DIY is you can start with a small investment and can make purchases over the several weeks you your first batch is fermenting.:


**DIY HOMEBREW FERMENTER &amp; SANITIZER INSTRUCTIONS** 

What you will need (LHBS=Local Homebrew Shop):

1.	Power Drill
2.	½” Spade Bit
3.	Permanent Marker
4.	1 Food Grade Plastic Bucket (Available at Lowe’s)
5.	1 Food Grade Plastic Lid (Available at Lowe’s)
6.	1 x Rubber Grommet - 1 x 5/8”OD x 5/16”ID
7.	2.5 feet - clear vinyl tubing (3/8” OD x 1/4""ID) or an airlock (@LHBS)
10.	Thermometer (@LHBS)
11.	Hydrometer (@LHBS, recommended by not required)

Fermenter Assembly Instructions

1.	Remove lid’s safety band.
2.	Place lid on bucket.
3.	Using 1/2” Spade Bit Drill near the center of the lid.
4.	Insert 5/8”OD x 5/16”ID Rubber Grommet into hole.
5.	Fill and Mark Bucket at 1 Gallon Increments (1 gallon = 16 cups) with your permanent marker.
6.	Insert either 3/8” OD x 1/4""ID clear vinyl tubing blow off tube or airlock into lid’s grommet.
7. Make Sanitizing Solution

**MAKE A SANITIZING SOLUTION**

The first step to making good beer is to have proper sanitizing habits. Before your beer is fully fermented it is susceptible to bacteria that can impact the flavor of your beer or even ruin your batch. Mix a Sanitizing Solution in the spray bottle and it keep handy for anything that will touch your wort or beer.  

What you will need (LHBS=Local Homebrew Shop):

1. 32 oz Spray Bottle
2.	Sanitizer (LHBS)

Sanitizer Instructions

1.	Fill Spray Bottle with 32 oz 
2.	Fill Spray Bottle with ¼ oz Sanitizer and shake
3.	Done!  

Once your fermenter and sanitizer is complete you can use it to make beer. **Do not fill your 5 gallon buckets past the four gallon mark**. You will need to leave about 1 gallon of room during fermentation [(Read Your Palmer)](http://www.howtobrew.com/section1/chapter8-2-2.html). 
Do not overfill your fermenter (the result may be an explosive mess). As I recommended earlier, consider making two fermenters. Use one to follow you recipes instructions, and the other to experiment. Do whatever interests you to experiment. Maybe add corn sugar or pitch different yeast. You could even try to learn how easy or hard it is to get the experimental batch infected and throw an apple core in there.

Assuming you have access to a 5 gallon pot or kettle, the costs (not including ingredients) to get started is about $29. I recommend purchasing a Hydrometer so you can calculate ABV and learn more about the brewing process but if money is short you don’t need it to make beer.

**DIY BOTTLING BUCKET INSTRUCTIONS**

What you will need (LHBS=Local Homebrew Shop):

1.	Electric Drill
2.	5/8” Spade Bit
3. 1 x 5 gallon Food Grade Plastic Buckets (Available at Lowe’s)
4. 1 x Rubber Grommet - 1x 13/16 OD X 1/2”ID
5. 1 x Lead Free Brass Hose Barb - 3/8 ID x 1/4MIP
6. 1 x Lead Free Brass Pipe Bushing - 3/8MIP x 1/4FIP
7. 2 #4 Hose Clamps
3.	50 x Bottle Caps (LHBS)
4.	1 x Bottle Capper (LHBS)
5.	PBW or OxyClean Free (LHBS or Dollar Store)
6. 1 x bottling wand (LHBS)
6.	3/4 cup Corn Sugar (LHBS or Grocery Store)
7.	40 x Bottles (LHBS or collect)

Bottling Bucket Assembly Instructions

1.	If you are concerned about lead in the brass fittings – treat them. [Read Your Palmer](http://www.howtobrew.com/appendices/appendixB.html)
2.	Measure and Mark 1 inch from bottom of bucket
3.	Using 5/8” spade bit drill hole centered at 1 inch mark
4.	Insert  13/16 OD X 1/2”ID rubber grommet into hole
5.	Screw the Brass Hose Barb into the hole from the outside 
6.	Screw the Brass Pipe Bushing onto the Barb from inside the bucket (optional but recommended)
7.	Make sure seal is tight (Add water and check for leaks)
8.	Connect one end of on-toxic pvc tubing to the barb
9.	Use a hose clamp to secure the tighten tubing on the barb (optional but recommended) 
10.	Connect other end of hose to bottling wand.
11.	Use a hose clamp to secure the tighten tubing on the barb (optional but recommended)


**Transfer from Fermenter to Bottling Bucket**

What you will need:

1. 4 feet food grade 3/8"" tubing (LHBS)
2. Fermenter
3. Bottling Bucket

Racking Instructions

1. Sanitize everything that will touch the wort
2. Place Fermenter on elevated surface to the Bottling Bucket (I put the fermenter on the counter and have the bottling bucket on the floor.
3. Using tube, siphon contents of fermenter into the bottling bucket. [Palmer's ""How to Siphon""](http://www.howtobrew.com/section1/chapter1-2.html)

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

*Cleaner – This is serious stuff so wear gloves while working with it. Use it to clean your kettle, fermenter and remove beer labels. Five Star’s PBW is the best. You can use Chlorine Free “OxyClean” type products (like this one I got for $1 at the Dollar Tree) but I’ve noticed the cheap stuff doesn’t work as well, can be scented, and takes a lot of rinsing or it will leave spots –if you can afford it buy PBW. 
 
*Hydrometer – You’ll use the hydrometer to measure the OG, or Original Gravity, before you add your yeast. When your beer is finished fermenting you’ll be able to calculate the ABV after using the hydrometer to record the FG, or Final Gravity.

Since they couldn't get beer or wine, they decided to brew their own. The penalty at the time was hand amputation, but as foreigners they'd only be deported. 

When I asked ""what type of yeast did you use?"", my Dad replied Fleischman's bread yeast. Then I asked ""what type of hops did you use?"". He then said, ""Shut up. We just wanted to get drunk."".

When I began brewing, I had a batch I was worried about. He gave me his version of RDWHAHB. He said ""Son, yeast has been making beer for thousands of years. Leave it alone, it knows what it's doing."" Good advice.

Here's the recipes:
