1362474302.0,70,self.abletonlive,19p5og,"Live 9 launches today, I strongly urge you not to buy it (yet)",trappar,132,62,187,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/19p5og/live_9_launches_today_i_strongly_urge_you_not_to/,"First, before I say anything else I want to say this: I have nothing against Ableton, Live, or anyone who uses it. I'm fairly sure I'll get a lot of hate for making this post (or at least get downvoted to oblivion), but I don't care.. it needs to be said.

With Live 8, Ableton established a precedent for launching products that were not ready. Now with Live 9 they are forming a pattern. You may be ready for Live 9 but it is not ready for you. There are still TONS of bugs, and I'm not talking about little insignificant things - I will give examples later. I'm sure in time they will iron out the bugs and it will be just as stable as Live 8 is, but right now it's just not ready for launch.

It's not hard to imagine reasons why Ableton might ship an incomplete product. They've been hyping it for a while, they want to bring on as many new customers before Bitwig launches this summer, they need money, etc... Regardless of their reasoning, it's unacceptable for them to ship a broken product. By buying Live 9 right now, you'd be sending Ableton the message that it's okay for them to do this.

So if standing up for good business practices isn't enough to convince you, here's some examples of what you'll get with Live 9:

* A new smart snap feature that takes the place of ""snap to grid"". You can not disable this feature, and it makes editing MIDI a nightmare.
* A new browser that will break many user's workflow.
* Strangely shaped and inconsistent automation curves.
* Group lanes can't be collapsed like they were in Live 8 without closing the group itself.
* Not all M4L devices function in Live 9 64-bit.
* Many users are reporting that the Live 9 indexer eats up CPU.
* Many reports of ""near constant crashing.""
* Recorded samples may be deleted after being saved.
* BPM missing from MIDI clips
* No more quick envelope buttons in clip view for pitch bend, volume, and pan.
* Joining midi clips in arrangement view may make seemingly random alterations to your notes
* Many 3rd party MIDI remote scripts are broken. Most notably all Maschine scripts I'm aware of are unusable. The NI developer who does the official one was quoted as saying that due to the lack of documentation and many changes to the LOM + Python API, it is very slow going developing an update.
* No more FF1 mode on the compressor for sidechaining or transient shaping.

That's just a very small snapshot. There are literally hundreds of other small bugs that are too specific to really talk about. Things like that the new mono sequencer won't play notes if you freeze/flatten a track.

Not only that, but Ableton did **not** develop any of the following popularly requested features:

* Dual monitor support.
* Delay compensation for automation.
* Bounce clip to audio.
* Ability to type automation values.
* Automation snap-to-grid
* Nested grouping
* Improved MIDI spec
* Multitake comping
* Retina/HiDPI support
* Support for 32-bit plugins in 64-bit Live
* etc.. etc.. etc..

TL;DR: Ableton Live 9 is shipping with many bugs. I do not support their decision to release it before it's ready, and you shouldn't either. We all know and love Live 8, so stick with that until Live 9 is actually ready.

Edits: revised wording/punctuation + added to example sections.

Edit: Okay so people in here seem to be overwhelmingly arguing points inconsequential to my actual argument so I obviously wasn't clear enough.

**This is not about the existing features, missing features, how good Live 8 or 9 is, how often you will run in to bugs.** Those are the main arguments I'm seeing, and all are irrelevant to this post. This is a moral/business ethics issue.

All software has bugs. Usually bugs are fixed as they are found. The problem with this launch is that that there is a massive list of known/acknowledged/reproducible bugs, and they decided to launch before addressing them. The beta testers did a really good job of finding bugs, and Ableton communicated multiple times that it was collecting that information, building a list, prioritizing, etc... They are launching without addressing a large majority of the reported problems. Also, they are launching without letting their users know that this is even an issue. Beta testers asked again and again to see a list of known bugs to help us more efficiently find problems (so we wouldn't waste our time reporting duplicate bugs) but Ableton has refused to show that list. Doesn't that come off as a bit shady?

I made an analogy below, I know it's not great but whatever... What if someone made a car, but as the car was finishing with its design they found that there were numerous issues with it. Sometimes the locks wouldn't unlock if it was too hot, the windshield wipers scraped gouges in the windshield, airbags wouldn't deploy if a collision was too hard, the engine wasn't well mounted to the car and could become loose, etc... But the company was on a deadline so they decided to start selling the car anyways with the agreement that if any issue happened you could have it fixed for free at a service center.

1375457513.0,40,self.abletonlive,1jkhif,Ill.Gates tells How To Approach Music Making with Ableton Live,darlingpinky,53,13,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/1jkhif/illgates_tells_how_to_approach_music_making_with/,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVQ8c19unnM

This video has helped me more than any other advice I have ever received in my 3 years of learning and producing music using Ableton Live. Psychological Organization - it's a very important and often overlooked piece of the puzzle. Ill.Gates tells how so many people try to make up for their lack of organization by buying equipment they won't need (I myself am guilty of this), buying more VSTs than they could ever utilize, buying more gear, buy more more more. 

He lays it down very plainly. Until you have your head right, until you have some organization as to how you are approaching your music making, none of the gear that you buy, none of the awesome VSTs you have will add to your arsenal. It's like going to war with tons of guns but no strategy. Organization and approach, to me, are the number one thing that people lack, and no one can teach you that but yourself. You need to figure out the elements you want in your music. You need to look at your approach as reproducible and abstractable, so you can come up with a singular approach to music making. This will advance your production much faster than starting each piece without knowing what direction to take. You will also enjoy it a lot more because you are not distracted by what I call ""meta-issues"" - things that just come in the way of the issues you are really trying to deal with - things such as layering, audio issues, workflow management etc. What you really want to deal with is sound design and song flow, not configuration and workflow issues. He also tells us how to split our time between sound design and song creation. It's very important to differentiate between the two, because if you get into sound design while working on the flow of a song, you will no doubt take a very long to complete a song, which sometimes kills the motivation to complete it at all.

Anyways, just watch it, it will change the way you look at music making. This video is part of a series that you have to buy, but this first one is free. I wish I could afford the entire series, but alas. Hope this helps you guys as much as it has helped me. 

P.S.: His music is very reminiscent of Bassnectar (who he has worked with). Those of you who like Bassnectar may be interested in checking out his album ill.Methodology. I hope this doesn't come off as I'm adveritising for him or anything, it's just some music I enjoy and his advice has helped me tremendously in music making and in other aspects of my life.

My cheap DJ setup

Materials: 

	Ableton Live 8

Korg [NanoKontrol](http://www.amazon.com/Korg-nanoKONTROL-USB-Controller-
White/dp/B001H2P294/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1322396404&amp;amp;sr=8-1) ($40)

Behringer [UCA-202](http://www.amazon.com/Behringer-UCA202-Audio-
Interface/dp/B000KW2YEI/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1322396456&amp;amp;sr=1-1) ($27)

Step 1: Creating a custom audio interface using the UCA-202 and your laptop's integrated sound card (I only 
know how to do this for Mac, so any Windows users that know how to do something similar please contribute!) - You'll have RCA outs for your main mix to whatever system you're plugging into, and use your laptop's headphone jack for cueing.

	Plug in the USB cable of the UCA-202 to your laptop.

	For Mac users, go to Applications - Utilities - Audio MIDI setup.app

	Click the + icon on the lower left hand corner. This should create a new Aggregate Device.

	Check the boxes next to 'USB Audio Codec' and 'Built-in Output'

	Rename the aggregate device to whatever.

FOR WINDOWS:
First off download/install asio4all, you'll probably need to restart. Open Ableton Live, go to Preferences, then the Audio tab. Set Driver Type to Asio, then audio device to asio4all (should say asio4allv2 or something). Click 'Hardware Setup' and the asio4all control panel should open. On the left you should see your computers primary sound driver, and your 2 channel soundcard. If not, try clicking the wrench button. Click the power buttons on the side to turn them both on. Now it sets up your outputs in the order listed there, so if your computers default driver is first outputs 1&amp;2 will be your laptop's headphone jack, and 3&amp;4 will be the sound card. This means in Ableton your main output might need to be 3&amp;4. Close the asio4all control panel, still in Ableton's preferences, click 'Output Config' and enable everything.


Step 2: Setting up cueing from your custom audio interface

	Open Ableton. 

Open [this project file](http://www.mediafire.com/?34okvbs4gcbdbts)

	Open Prefereces -&gt; Audio

	For ""Audio Output Device"" choose your custom audio interface.

	Click on ""Output config""

	Enable everything. Close preferences.

	In Session View, in the I-O tab (Lower right hand corner, In-Out section), set master out to 3/4 and cue to 
1/2

	Close the I-O tab to maximize screen real estate.


Step 3: Setting up your Korg NanoKontrol

	Connect your Korg NanoKontrol via USB

Download the [Template](http://www.mediafire.com/?uy57m4v5yq6c153)

	Open the Korg Kontrol Editor (I think it comes in a cd with the nanoKontrol)

	File -&gt; Open -&gt; Template

	Then Communication -&gt; Write Scene Set

	Close Korg Kontrol Editor

Step 4: Putting it all together

Download [this PDF](http://www.mediafire.com/?85z6m1958w65mzt) and refer to it for the following controls:

	1. Deck A Autofilter High Cut (activate effect with button below knob)

	2. Deck A Autofilter Low Cut (activate effect with button below knob)

	3. Deck A EQ Low 

	4. Deck A EQ Mid

	5. Deck A EQ High

	6. Deck A PingPong Delay Send

Something I've always found fascinating is the effort many producers put into their kick drums. Yesterday I spent roughly 2 hours making a kick within an instrument rack, using 6 different samples each with a different part of the spectrum and individual compression. I set the decay to a macro control to modulate the tail, and routed them through an audio effect rack for further compression, saturation, EQ and Mono.

What amazed me here is just how phenomenal this kick sounds in comparison to, say, a Vengeance kick sample straight out of the box. You get an incredible amount of mileage out of your kick if you're willing to dive in and develop the ear for each tone and timbre of your kick; learn to weed out any offensive frequencies, compress accordingly, and generally you can create something fully unique and your own, that's 100x better than just a sample. On top of that, you can individually add effects to different parts of the spectrum; I'm playing with a bit of reverb on the high click of my kick to give a 'big room' feel, while adding a haas delay via Filter Delay on the mid/high range so the kick sounds wider, while still having a mono bass/sub.

Anyway, I'm curious what each of you do to your kicks to make them your own, and what you look for in your samples/effects/EQ'ing to make them really stand out.

Been bedrooming for 3+ years now, turning more into an ""engineer"" than a producer or dj, but learning so many tricks/experience in all the roles.

Had my first time playing live tonight. Used an APC40, and an iPad running TouchAble. Two tracks/decks with my custom ""DJ Dank Effects"" rack, which includes some common dj effects on both tracks, like beat repeats, hi/low passes, fade2grey, automatic volume 1/4 note dips, etc.

Used the APC as a backup to the TouchAble just in case shit crashed, and took the iPad into the crowd to dance and get other fellow dj's to play with the beat repeat while it was in my hands, it was an awesome way to spice things up. People didn't believe it at first, but I made sure to show visual/audio relationship of what was going on. Highly recommend the app if you have an iPad.

Had a ball just wanted to share, hope you all enjoy the story or at least get some inspiration to share or get out there and crush it on ya owns.

1366207286.0,27,self.abletonlive,1cj64c,Using Push's step sequencer with external VSTs and drum machines,darlingpinky,32,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/1cj64c/using_pushs_step_sequencer_with_external_vsts_and/,"I recently got the Ableton Push, and was disappointed to find out that it only supports step-sequencing with Live's internal Drum Rack, not external drum racks or VSTs since those are loaded as instruments in Live and not as drum racks. And the step-sequencer only shows up when a track with a Drum Rack placed directly onto the track is selected. After googling for about 4 hours, I finally found a pretty awesome solution.

**The solution is to use a modified version of the Push script**, which enables two features I had originally thought the Push already had (but turns out it doesn't). The first feature is that the Push can now detect drum racks that are nested inside an instrument rack on a track. This allows you to do something like [this](http://imgur.com/OYtAWGi) and step-sequence with an external VST (Battery 3, in this instance). Be aware that the drum rack is only in the instrument rack to make the Push bring up the step-sequencer when the track is selected. Other than that, there is no purpose for the drum rack. Below the drum rack chain, there is a chain for Battery 3 in which I have loaded up NI's Battery 3 VST. The trick that makes this work is that all incoming MIDI notes are directed into both chains and the Battery 3 VST will play any notes that are being sequenced or incoming from a MIDI clip. 

The second feature this modified script enables is velocity sensitivity in the step-sequencer. In the original Push script, when you hit a step in the sequencer, it will always record the velocity as 100. With the modified script, it will actually record the velocity with which you strike the step. This enables some truly expressive control over the step-sequencer. I can't believe they didn't originally have this feature in the step-sequencer.

[Here is the link](https://www.box.com/s/lxpem3jnnqgl0in742sn) for the Control Surface script to make this work. I originally found it in [this post](https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=191287)  in the Ableton Live forums. The installation instructions are included in the download, but basically just replace Push's remote script with the downloaded scripts. Check the included .pdf for more details.

Anyways, I'm sure I'm not the only one who's been wanting to use Push as a step-sequencer for things other than the drum rack, and now, thanks to this modified script, we can. All credit goes to the editor of this script. Thanks!

**EDIT**: Once you drag a drum rack inside an instrument rack, you will have to deselect the track (select another track) and reselect it for the step-sequencer to show up on the Push.",,False,self,t5_2rbt4,1366211547.0,,,True,t3_1cj64c,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/1cj64c/using_pushs_step_sequencer_with_external_vsts_and/,

It's wonderful to see so many users of the same software coming together to share knowledge, techniques, and help each other use this extremely powerful program in more creative and expressive ways.

But --
-- 
Often I go on this subreddit and see some novice level questions. Let me get this straight, there is nothing wrong with a lack of knowledge and a will to seek it. But many times these questions can be answered in a much more clear and explanatory way by simply **reading the manual**.

I know how that sounds. ""Thanks, mom! *tacka tacka tacka ableton noodling tacka tacka tacka"". But hear me out on this one. 

Lately I haven't been paying attention in class because honestly Film History and Business Ethics are pretty fucking boring. So to fill in the time I've been reading articles about synthesis techniques, tutorials on broad creation of certain EDM genres, and many, **many** manuals. I have a folder on my desktop dedicated just to software manuals. I've been pretty good with NI's Massive for a while, but after reading the manual my workflow became significantly faster. Not to mention it was just generally interesting to me to know more about the intricacies of the software.

Live's manual is a doozy, I know. I haven't even read it all. Nor am I purposely trying to just schedule a day to sit down with the manual and read for 4 straight hours. What I do do (*tee hee*) is open it up whenever I've got a little bit of free time and I'm not feeling particularly inspired to create. It helps. It really does. My workflow is faster, I can do things I couldn't do before, things I previously thought were complex are now simple using tools of the software I didn't know how to use before.

**TL;DR** Please read your manuals. It will benefit you greatly. And it's not even boring. Personally I enjoy reading them.

**EDIT**: If you don't have the manual and don't want to waste your time looking around sketchy websites to find it, PM me and I'll point you in the right direction.",,False,self,t5_2rbt4,1352413383.0,,,True,t3_12vl5b,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/12vl5b/a_thought_on_this_sub_and_how_to_improve_your/,

Like the title says, Ive been using Live for about 10 months now and am at the point where I need to expand tonally and break out of just using the Live instruments and effects (powerful as they are...). I have Suite, so have all the instruments, and I also have a copy of MASSIVE that i havent really used for much more than sub-bass (I know its incredibly powerful and definitely plan to get into it soon).

I really have no idea where to start. What do I even need? I make electronic type music. Hiphop, reggae, and pretty much anything else with lots of bass and good rhythms. Some effects plug ins would be great. Compressors, delays, etc...

Also, if anyone has any advice on mixing songs, please let me know! This is also part of the reason why my tracks thus far are suffering tonally and sounding flat. I know enough to bounce everything out from MIDI to WAV and then mix further from there, but am at a loss for ways to make a heavy sub bass without blowing up the entire song or having my synths sound bright and powerful but not cheesy.

I want it to be enjoyable, but painfully uncomfortable. My target audience is very familiar with internet culture.

**Ideas from last year:**

-In Lil' John's ""Get Low,"" loop ""skeet skeet skeet"" indefinitely.
-Regardless of the song, slowly bump up the tempo over the course of several measures and then drop it abruptly.
-Over time, make everything devolve into ""The Macarena"" or ""Who Let The Dogs Out"" only to switch back to something else a few measures later.
-Wear and utilize tear-off pants with an otherwise dapper outfit.
-Find an obnoxious sound bite (I used the ""YOOOOOOUUUUU!"" from Soulja Boy's ""Crank That"") and consistently play it where it doesn't belong.
-Incorporate any well-known internet meme/song/sound bite known to mankind (They tend to go apeshit over this).

I'll work with any genre of music. What would you want to see at an Awkward Dance Party?",,False,self,t5_2rbt4,False,,,True,t3_v5ndx,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/v5ndx/awkward_dance_party_musicediting_suggestions/,

However, the version of Live that I have is the one that only came with simpler and impulse (no operator or any other VSTs). I'd really like a synth VST to supplement my production, whether its free or paid. I'd like to stay under a budget of roughly 150-200$ if I do buy something.

I've used Massive on my old laptop (my friend installed it for me, but after migrating to a new laptop I can only use the demo version) and while it seems cool, it seems pretty rough, and I'd like something that catered towards more ambient noises, though I'll check out any recommendations anyone might have.

I'm messing around with Ableton Live for over a year now, and it's big fun to come up with beats / melodies and to turn ideas into sounds. I got used to Ableton's built-in plugins and some VSTs, I spent days reading about music theory and I just listen to music a LOT since I'm also part of a group of DJs (playing Techno) and I'm generally very open to other genres.

I love starting the program and messing around, building scenes, loops and instruments. I love this creative process of coming up with sounds that suite each other and play well together. Then I end up with like 16 bars of a track.

But as soon as I have this ""scene"" and I want to start arranging stuff, it feels like all creativity is gone.
Then I either end up with tracks that are 1-2 minutes long or the whole project gets buried in the depths of my hard disc. 

No matter how I approach things. Whether I work in Session View or Arrangement View only, whether I build some scenes in Session View and try to work on with it in Arrangement View, I'm having an incredibly hard time continuing my work.

Searching for advice on track arrangement or watching others do it, didn't help me yet. I can't seem to find ""my"" way of continuing the work and it feels awful to bury my ideas in such an unfinished state... And yes, I've tried following the ""just finish it, no matter how much you like it"" advice, but I ended up with extremely repetitive tracks.

So, my question to you guys is: How do you arrange? Do you have any advice on how to start? I appreciate it! :)

And sorry for my writing, I'm not a native speaker.

This class will be an introduction to the program Ableton Live. I hope to teach some analog musicians a deeper understanding of the musical possibilities within live, as well as to teach those already familiar with Live a few new tricks. I think this class will be taught via tinychat, to allow questions/answers as well as a step by step walkthrough.

**12 Week Course**

The first class will be Thurs. July 1st @ 9pm EST

A big issue for me is that I can't seem to find samples that sound good together (specifically hi-hats). 

So how do you guys do it? Do you use specific drum machines and stick to that? Pitch up/down and duplicate the same hi-hats? Or just spend hours browsing different hits until you find a decent sounding one?

Here are some examples to the shuffle I'm referring to:

IE: Nesting. 

When I play my own tracks, I want to be able to play certain parts live, or jam out if the crowd is feeling a certain track. I can load up individual tracks and play them that way, but there will still be a lag when I open up a new track in a new window, and there really isn't an easy way to beatmatch two currently open .als files in multiple windows.

I realize I could do this by loading up all of the individual instruments and clips into the same master file and switch between them, but that seems cumbersome and ultimately confusing. 

Is there a way to jump back and forth between song files, or load up multiple .als files into one master track so I can edit/play them individually, and not have lags in the overall performance?

Ableton will still be able to access them, but your folders will look cleaner. I'm writing this for Windows. One last note - if your folder options are set to show all hidden files/folders, this obviously won't do anything. I also assume no responsibility if you break something.

EDIT: I know this method works in Linux, but a quick google tells me that OS X doesn't support hidden file types. I'll tinker with it later today and post my findings here.
______________________________
**To hide .asd files in a directory:**

* 
Open the command prompt as an administrator. Navigate to the parent folder of your music library. For example, I'll use C:\Newer Music.

* 
Enter the following command at the prompt. It should look like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/uGwjz.png)

        attrib +h *.asd /s


**To revert changes:**

* 
Again, open an elevated prompt and navigate to your library.
* 
Enter the following command to restore default.

        attrib -h *.asd /s

You just group your sounds into four drum racks and drop each drum rack onto a different quadrant of the grid. 


[Download Link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iy9acjoovzs5yln/64%20Pad%20Drum%20Rack.adg)


In addition, I've added a macro to change the bank of each rack (note that bank 3 is the default bank). To insert a drum rack, you just drag it into the device portion of the chain you want it in: Upper Right is Quadrant I, Upper Left is QII, Lower Left is QIII, and Lower Right is QIV, as in a Cartesian Plane.


**IMPORTANT: You cannot use this preset with Push in the default Scale!!!** You must switch the mode to Sequential Up. To do this, press ""Scales"" on the Push, then hold shift. You will see several mode options; select the second-to-last one, which says ""Sequent^"". Then, back in the Scales menu, select ""Chromatic"". Keep it in the key of C, or enable Fixed mode. These steps ensure that all notes on the drum racks will be playable, and that no notes will be repeated. Unfortunately, you won't be able to use Push's step sequencer, as this is considered an instrument rack.


I've also included a macro which disables velocity sensitivity so you can play the Push like a Launchpad. I prefer this when playing samples other than drums, such as instruments, FX and vocals. If you want, you can insert an instrument that isn't a drum rack into one of the slots, but it will stay in C Chromatic unless you add the Scale MIDI Effect.


Have fun, and please feel free to share anything you make with this, or any better way of enabling ""Launchpad Mode"", as this is really just a cheap replacement for a proper Max Device considering I'm using Live 9 Standard :P  Cheers!",,False,self,t5_2rbt4,False,,,True,t3_1jbs96,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/1jbs96/my_64_pad_drum_rack_preset_for_push_users/,

1366729314.0,15,self.abletonlive,1cxsxe,Comprehensive list of Live 9's new features,RTHM,17,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/1cxsxe/comprehensive_list_of_live_9s_new_features/,"Last weekend I was invited to give a clinic on Live 9 and the new Push controller at SAE - Nashville, TN. In preparation for this, I looked everywhere to find a comprehensive list of these features (Ableton.com, forums, YouTube, etc.) with not much luck. So, I went through everything I could get my hands on and compiled what I believe to be a complete new features list for Live 9. I thought you guys might be able to use or add to it:

**Updated Browser:**

•	Two pane

•	Categories - Program sorts sounds/clips/plugins/etc. automatically from within the Libraries

•	Places - Some default (i.e. Packs, Current Project, etc.) but also allows you to create your own shortcuts to directory locations which are now unlimited

•	All built-in devices (i.e. synth patches, Ableton packs, etc.) have short previews now. Unfortunately does not work for 3rd party plugins like VSTs or M4L devices.

•	Search function now indexes in the background when other tasks aren’t being performed. It also tries to index everything at one time. This keeps the search times much lower after it has been used for a bit.

•	New enabled/disabled columns within the content browser pane:

•	Place – Location within browser of file or pack

•	Rank - Program ranks the most commonly used folders and files



**Arrange Mode Interface:**

•	Added pre-roll option to metronome button. Helpful for recording.

•	Global groove value % has been added back to the top control bar. This only becomes visible once a groove value has been applied.

•	Quantization Menu has moved to left

•	Overdub button “OVR” has been replaced with “+”. Same functionality

•	Added “Automation Arm” button allowing for the recording of manual parameter changes to both arrangement and session mode clips.

•	Replaced back to arrangement button with “Re-Enable Automation”. This performs exactly the same way except it only returns automation and not audio.

o	Back to arrangement audio is now done per track using new arrows that appear

o	Back to arrangement button is still available within Session Mode in lower right corner



•	Draw mode switch (B) is now on the right side of the screen

•	Arrange Mode and Clip view now have phrase shading. Time signatures adjusts the shading appropriately. Very helpful for maintaining phrasing in arrangement.

•	“Save as default audio track” - Right-click context menu



**Audio to MIDI:**

•	Convert harmony to MIDI – Takes an audio clip and converts to sustained MIDI notes and polyphonic chords. This is especially good for full track or multiple instrument extraction. It analyzes and creates a new MIDI track with instrument rack containing a piano which can then be mapped to anything.

•	Convert melody to MIDI – Designed more for monophonic note extraction taking the dominant notes and laying them over a MIDI clip. This is great for baselines. It analyzes and creates a new MIDI track with an instrument rack. Auto loads a rack containing an Analog synth that can blend between synth and piano.

•	Convert drums to MIDI – Analyzes and creates new MIDI track with drum rack. Auto maps sound to default 606 percussion sounds attempting to match the audio.

•	This not only recognizes the sounds and pitches but also the velocity of the MIDI notes.



**MIDI clip controls:**

•	Easy transpose by min/max notes

•	:2/*2 – Half/Double tempo. This works the same as audio clips have had previously

•	Rev – Reverses the rhythmic pattern of the clip or selection

•	Inv – Inverts the notes within the clip or selection keeping the hi/lo values

•	Legato – Lengthens all of the notes to the beginning of the next note played

VST support – Live now offers a 64 bit version. However, this version will not support VSTs that only run in 32 bit mode. Although I have not tested, I understand that the inverse is also true. This is a pretty big issue for some users using many VSTs. However, there is really no need for anyone to install the 64 bit version as its only advantage is that it can use more than 4GB of memory (processor usage or sound rendering is not affected!). Most projects will not need this much memory allocated.

(2x the price that a new purchaser would pay)

I called Ableton support today and explained my situation, and the guy I spoke with said that Ableton is currently trying to attract new users, people who have never purchased Live before.  Hence the $450 bargain

He said that there is an upcoming campaign from Ableton, which should start when/after Live 9 is released, that will offer a discounted upgrade price to Live 9 for current Live 8 owners.  

Also, if you own Suite 8 and purchase Live 9 standard, all of your suite features will carry over.  (With M4L included in Suite 9, I would definitely want Suite 9 though.)

Anyways, if you are a current Live 8 owner, you should call Ableton support and ask about this.  I'd be interested to hear what different sales reps have to say.

Need some assistance before the next one.,andifall,16,4,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/1b6mrk/mad_click_problems_destroyed_our_gig_need_some/,"Played a gig a couple of days ago with Ableton and it all went quite wrong. We've performed a few times, but most of the time it works, even in practise.

Here's the thing. I trigger samples on my laptop using my iPad and sing live. All of the sound is going through my audio interface (Mackie Onyx 820i) I have a click coming out of the headphone port of my Macbook by setting up an aggregate device. 

Every now and then, (usually when we start the set, not usually in the middle) the click, for some reason is out. It's not on the beat - slightly out. Usually, it's not that big of a deal because I just stop all samples and it sorts itself out. Not this time, however - the click this time was out at the beginning (I had to restart Live in the middle of a gig) - it corrected itself, but then during a loud track, the click once again went out. On stage we couldn't hear too much because the drums were so loud, but offstage it sounded like utter garbage as the drummer was drumming to a different click . . . 

Obviously we have to get this sorted as we have another gig next week. 

Is this a processing issue? I have a 2009 (I believe) macbook pro with 2.8ghz, 8gb RAM, SSD HardDrive. 

Could this be an issue with the new interface I just bought? The Mackie? 

It's also worth mentioning that I changed the sound of the click in Live's settings - i.e. replaced the samples, as the click is too high in pitch and the drummer wanted the click to be lower. This was how it was for the gig, but I have used these samples before and it has been fine. Also, I have just put the original samples back in there place and it is STILL not working and going out of time.

I can't find anything about this on the web, so any help would be so SO helpful.

Secondly, I've got a desktop and laptop. I'd like to be able to go back and forth between the two, working on the same projects and with the same program, with all the same features. Is this possible, and what would it entail?

Also, if anyone could recommend a tutorial that goes into the more technical aspects of ableton (hardware, sound, how to not embarrass yourself by not understanding what the computer is doing), I'd appreciate it. I imagine showing up to perform and having tech-savvy audience members murmuring ""why would he do that like that? doesn't he know all you have to do is blah blah blah.""

Full disclosure, I am an Ableton noob. However, I don't need handholding, just a starting point. I certainly would be happy with just a link to a tutorial as well, but I just don't know what I'd Google for.

Anyway, as far as I can tell, they employ on damn near every song a certain... vocal effect. It isn't on the main vocals, but instead sounds like a synthesizer doing an 'ooo' or 'aaa' sound. HOWEVER, I don't think it is any kind of synth. 

It sounds like it is snippets of the singer's voice, moved up or down a few octaves, with some kind of chromatic sounding effect (could be just from the changing of the octave) and then kind of... chopped up.

[The beginning of this song is a great example of what I mean.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgKk8Eqyzkk)

[And here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjC-hznTwMA)

A few other characteristics that make me think there is more going on... it sounds as if it produces some consonant sounds (de de de de do, eee ooo).

So this is the first tutorial in a series I want to do where I go through a whole bunch of topics concerning Electro House (or similar) production techniques. I've been producing with Live for years and have finally gotten some tracks signed and I felt like, since I've learned so much from the online community, I'm hoping to maybe help out anybody looking to get a better sound with Live. 

If you want to check out my Electro House-ish duo, Zulu Company, you can hear some of our stuff [here](http://soundcloud.com/zulucompanymusic) and our Facebook page [here](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Zulu-Company/116138360795).   

I realize this first video is long, I wanted to adress a bunch of basic funtions for anybody who is just starting out.  My future videos will be much shorter and more focused on a particular sound (example: Zedd bass in Massive tutorial).  I would also love to get some requests if anybody wants to make a particular sound that I can help them with, feel free to message me!

In the comments you'll find a download for the Live Pack with all the samples in the tutorial, as well as the final bounced samples for anybody who's not using Live and just wants to try out the samples for their own track.

Anyway, I've been searching around but can't seem to quite understand the pull workflow with DJing with live. Basically, I've broken my huge knowledge gap into a few questions

* **Warping** - I understand tracks need to be warped to keep them in time with the metronome / BPM of the session, how is Live a good choice for DJing when you want to play something on the fly? Does warping not take long when you get used to it?
* **Advantages** - I've always imagined live sets as more remixing things on the fly, though apart from setting pre-que points, loops and having a lot of 'virtual decks' how does Live really stand out as opposed to 'traditional DJing'
* **Effects / EQ (APC40)** - Without remapping the APC40, how do you use the EQ and a filter effect at the same time? I keep having to jump between 'Send A, Send B'
* **Free time** - With traditional DJing, between mixing you get a bit of 'free time' while figuring out what to play next and before beatmixing the next track in. What do you do within this 'free time' do be creative, but not going over kill on effects?
* **Set up** - How do you guys set up your arrangement view? I'm more so looking for personal preferences here, I know how the arrangement view works, just want to know how you use it to take full advantage.
* **Looping and Queueing (APC40)** - Without having to grab my mouse, can I set loops and cue points on the fly with the APC40?

Sorry for the overload of questions, I've done heaps of tutorials and I know HOW live works, but not in a personal and optimised way.

The core of it uses the concept of ill.Gate's ""128s"". 

I have 8 drum cells; 2 kicks, a snare, 2 claps, a closed hat, an open hat, and a crash. Each cell is a Sampler loaded with around 100 samples a piece, each corresponding to a macro for the sample selector. 

Each cell is grouped into a chain for its part, for three chains- Kick, Snare/Clap, and Hats. The chains will have EQ Eights on them; for the kick chain, I'm rolling off frequencies around 100Hz as well as the high end, snare chain I'm rolling off a little under 200, and hat's are high passed in the EQ as well.

At this point, I wanted to see what you guys thought about this, what should be added next or what should be changed that's been done.

[This is what it sounds like.](http://drop.io/griwcmf)

1) start new session with 3 audio tracks and 1 return track. setup track routing as follows:

* 1 Audio: Audio From - No Input, Monitor In, Audio To - 2-Audio
* 2 Audio: Audio From - No Input, Monitor In, Audio To - 3-Audio
* 3 Audio: Audio From - No Input, Monitor Auto, Audio To - Master, Record Armed
* A Return/A Utility: Audio To - 1-Audio

**EDIT:** zap-rowsdower has pointed out that Live does not allow monitoring of tracks with neither an input set or an output being routed to it. so setting No Input before Monitor In won't work. set the Audio To for all 3 tracks first, then Monitor, then Audio From. that should be easiest.

An alternative routing pattern such as the following will work:

* 1 Audio: Audio From - A-Return/A-Utility, Monitor In, Audio To - Sends Only
* 2 Audio: Audio From - 1-Audio, Monitor In, Audio To - Sends Only
* 3 Audio: Audio From - 2-Audio, Monitor In, Audio To - Master
* A Return/A Utility: Audio To - Sends Only

routing 1 to 2 and 2 from 1 doubles gain, and since the signal is already super hot we don't want to do that.

**END EDIT**

2) drop a Utility on the Return track with DC filter on, and put a Saturator on track 2 so we don't blow our speakers. go ahead and turn on the Saturator's DC filter as well.  

3) get some noise started with either a sample on track 1 or some crackle from the Vinyl Distortion effect.

4) turn up Send A on track 1 to get some feedback going. 

5) drop effects into track 1 and tweak your heart out. use EQ8 to boost the low end for lots of rumblies.

other really fun effects include

* Grain Delay
* Frequency Shifter
* Redux
* Resonators
* Erosion
* etc.

and now you know the only thing i know how to do with Live that isn't common knowledge.

I want to start (slowly) hacking my way through these and put together a proper useful library. Got a number of questions and/or talking points for the subreddit with the theme: **How do you go about putting together your sample library?**

* How do you decide which samples to keep and which to ditch i.e. on a sample CD of 100 hi-hats, how do you determine which ones make the cut?
* Do you like to keep processed effected samples or would you rather get the original ""dry"" samples so you can tweak them yourself?
* Do you collect a huge list of samples (organized your way) and call on them when you need, or do you pre-build kits/templates/racks and reach for those when the time comes?
* Do you build a library specifically for an album/project? Example: This is going to be an electrorock album, so build a library (or mini-library) specifically designed with that in mind.
* Have you seen a collection of samples and skipped right past it knowing you'll never use it? Ever regretted that move?
* How do you name and organize your sample/preset library and its contents?

1340378768.0,11,self.abletonlive,vfsw5,Auto arm selected track : HOWTO!,hard-drive-ghost,12,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/vfsw5/auto_arm_selected_track_howto/,"I've been looking to do this for a while so now that I found out how (thanks to Garamasala and nativeKONTROL), I thought I'd share it here (apologies for the writing: english is not my main language). It looks a bit long, but it's quite easy and once it's done it's a relief to not have to think about arming tracks.

I ran into [LPC-Live](http://www.nativekontrol.com/LPC-Live.html) for the Launchpad a few months ago and thought it was amazing. But I didn't notice **TrackDefs** then (you don't need a specific controller).



*TrackDefs is a configurable MIDI remote script for Live 8.1.3 or later that allows you to define default settings to use for inserted Tracks. Unlike other remote scripts, this one actually doesn’t work with a particular MIDI controller. Instead, it changes default behaviors in Live that apply when you’re using any MIDI controller, or a QWERTY or a mouse.*


Here is a step by step tutorial for setting the Auto Arm Selected Track feature, I'll paste instructions from nativeKONTROL. 


First go to [this page](http://beatwise.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=production&amp;action=display&amp;thread=709) and grab the current free version of TrackDefs. *The folder named ‘TrackDefs’ needs to be placed in Live’s MIDI Remote Script directory. Please close Live before transferring this folder.*

*On Windows, this directory is located in: Program Files\Ableton\Live 8.x.x\Resources.*

*On OS X, to get to this directory: 1. Go to Applications, find Live.app, right-click and select Show Package Contents. 2. The directory is located in: Contents\App-Resources.*

*In Ableton the following settings will be found in Preferences on the MIDI/Sync tab.*
*Select TrackDefs as a Control Surface.*
*Leave the Input and Output set to None.*

Then you’ll need to go modify the file named TrackDefsUserConfig.py, which you’ll find in the TrackDefs folder. *You can modify this file with any text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit). The file itself includes instructions on how to modify the file along with descriptions of all the included options.*

Look for ""EXCLUSIVE_ARM_ON_SELECT = 0"" and simply replace 0 by 1. That's it! *DO NOT change any of the spacing in this file. DO NOT change the name of this file or its file extension. When done making your changes, just save the file. After saving this file, you will need to close/restart Live for your changes to take effect.*

Check the few **other settings** in the TrackDefsUserConfig.py file and check **LPC-Live**, for real! There's a huge amount of intelligent work there!



Note: 
If you are using Live 8.3:

*On Windows with 8.3, the new default location for Live’s MIDI Remote Scripts directory is: C:\ProgramData\Ableton\Live 8\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts (Windows Vista and 7) C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Ableton\Live 8\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts (Windows XP)*

*On OSX with 8.3, the new name for Live’s app is Ableton Live 8.app, so you need to locate this app, right-click on it and select Show Package Contents. Within the package, the MIDI Remote Scripts directory is where it has always been: Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts*

any tips or suggestions on how i can do this?

EDIT: Thanks for all of the helpful suggestions, guys!

What I've found is first of all, I needed to upgrade to Live Suite in order to take advantage of Operator (I had purchased Analog separate). Analog doesn't really make the sounds I want without excessive amounts of tweaking and layering. Operator seems to allow more freedom in creating completely warped and spacey sounds without digging too deep.

Also, I like the idea of spending an entire session just creating patches, and saving them for later use. Of course, when you have a melody in mind maybe you should just rough out the basic idea and return to it afterwards to tweak and perfect the sound.

 Anyway, I am building a multi-purpose FX rack and am having a hard time putting together combinations of FX that sound somewhat natural while still being noticeable enough to make a difference.  I was thinking transitions, builds, etc.  I was wondering if anyone would want to discuss some of your favorite combinations of FX to use for either DJing or for production (if you don't mind sharing secrets). 

I'll start.  For the rack I mentioned above, I have the obvious hi and lo-pass filters.  Additionally, it has a beat repeat macro, a crush/fade-out effect with a lo-pass filter going high to low combined with a reverb and a bitcrusher.  Lastly, it has a Chorus and Phaser combo that spaces everything out and makes it sound swirly.  I'm thinking about how to implement a good effected delay with perhaps some grain delay or distortion (I already have a send with a simple delay on it and a reverb send).  Anyone care to add to this?

So until lately I've been very much an analog person. The convenience of having pristine drum samples at the touch of a keyboard is just too hard to resist, at least for the type of music I'm currently making. 



I've picked up a few sample packs of drums and have a question about the high hat. The packs all seem to follow a similar pattern; they have samples for hitting a closed hat, hitting an open hat, and closing a hat with the foot pedal.


What I can't understand is the open hat. The samples are long so the sound gradually rolls off. What's the ideal practice to take the open hat sample and mix it with the foot pedal? I'm trying to simulate the open hat's noise stopping similar to when a drummer hits the foot pedal.

It seems like the samples are made to be edited this way because of how much room there is in the sample. This seems like such a simple question I feel kinda stupid for asking it.

I’m beginning to use Ableton Live 8, and there are a couple particular effects I’m interested in learning, but don’t know how to describe them. I’m a complete beginner. 

The first is that slat type of pattern used in lots of psytrance, the only way I know how to describe the sound is by saying it sounds like venetian blinds. [Here’s a clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuZNLKTUlsY) from a song that uses the technique, the effect begins at right at the beginning and is very pronounced.  

The second is the effect that makes music sound like it’s moving around your head, where it plays with the stereo features and moves from one ear to another. 

The third effect I’d like to learn is used in psytrance a lot too, the effect where it sounds like the notes are being stretched and compressed… Don’t know how to describe it, but it almost sounds like the tone is being fed through a funnel. [Here’s an example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCZ4RPpsdlY), also begins right off the bat.

But... I don't want to use Logic, I want to use Ableton.

If you use Live's Session View for performance, improvising, etc. you may know that you can apply automation of effects and plugins directly in the clip using the clips envelope. While the envelope is linked to the clip (the default) the automation will be constrained by the length of the clip.  But when you unlink the envelope you remove those constraints allowing you to extend the length of the automation beyond the length of the clip.  A 1/16th note sample can be transformed over several bars for instance.  This is a really great way to add movement and variety to a short sample and works with anything that can be automated.

1327145813.0,11,self.abletonlive,oq4p7,looking for feedback on my custom controller design for ableton live,ultra242,13,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/oq4p7/looking_for_feedback_on_my_custom_controller/,"[http://www.sub-version.net/diy/mblive/trigger/images/full_view.gif](http://www.sub-version.net/diy/mblive/trigger/images/full_view.gif)

i've been working on a design for a custom ableton live control surface. the idea is to have a compact clip controller that automatically integrates itself with ableton live.

i know my own needs for this, but i want to make this device in a kit-ready format so that others can buy the circuit boards and parts and build this relatively painlessly. i'm looking for feedback on the controls, to see what needs i may be able to cover for other people. i'm not looking for feedback on the size (if you don't need a small clip controller, it's not for you) or the general format of the box.

the platform is MIDIbox. some of you may have heard of it. this particular box is using 32 bit microcontroller and the entire system is USB powered. the code for the MIDIbox is written by myself in C, and it communicates via MIDI (not in the usual way of using MIDI, i've written a system that allows much more detailed communication) with a python script (LiveAPI) i've written to run in ableton live. to use it, you simply load the script like any other control surface. the usb drivers are already on your computer.

once the script is loaded, everything maps automatically. there is not a single MIDI map or any other setup necessary. this box is part of a larger system i am working on, which will include a tracks controller (vol/pan/eq/etc), and a universal box with a graphical lcd that will be used to automatically adapt to the device you're using (i.e. after an initial setup, the box can ""follow"" what instrument you've selected, adapt it's knobs/switches accordingly, and put the parameter names on the lcd). so keep in mind that universal functionality in this box isn't necessary. i just want to control clips in a manner that is useful both live an in the studio. step sequencing and other functions are also planned in the future.


the interface:

the interface has 64 tactile buttons and and 59 3 color leds (green, red, orange).

the main section has buttons that trigger a 5 (scene) x 8 (track) grid of clips. the leds above each button give feedback based on what's going on in live. red if a clip exists but is not playing, green if a clip is playing, flashing green if a clip is about to be triggered, and orange if a clip is playing or looping (these might change).

the 5 buttons (vertical) to the right launch scenes.

the 8 buttons across the bottom stop the playing clip on the track, and the bottom-right button stops all clips.

the left side has play/stop controls, record mode toggle, overdub toggle, and each has led feedback to show the state.

the bottom left are the bank buttons. the script puts the famous red box around the clips on live's interface, and the bank buttons will move the red box accordingly, and of course the led indicators on the clip grid will change as well.

prev is a preview button. if you ""get lost"" on the button grid, holding preview and pressing a clip button will put the red box around only that clip so you can see which clip you would be triggering with that button. using preview with the stop button will highlight that track, and a scene button will only highlight that scene.

sel is a select button. holding select and pressing a clip button will activate that clip and make live show clip detail at the bottom. using select with a stop button will activate the track and show device view. select and scene will activate that scene, and while holding select, a scene button will toggle between clip detail and track view (i haven't yet finalized how this function will work, but it's an idea).

the alt button will allow many other parameters to be changed at once. the first row of clip leds will now show which tracks are muted, and allow you to toggle mute for them. second row is for solo. the third and fourth row will allow you to nudge the clip forward and backward. the stop buttons at the bottom will let you toggle arm for the track, and the leds will indicate which are armed for recording. the scene buttons will change the entire mode of the box for future applications.

finally, holding the loop button will change the clip leds to show you which clips are set to loop, and let you toggle loop for that clip.


the case:

the case is aluminum and is sold in several colors, as well as bare aluminum so you can paint it yourself. the holes must be machine cut because accuracy is extremely important, but i will offer a file that builders can send to a company with the case to have it done. the text graphics can be etched by the company, or other options such as lasertrans can be used. the overall size of the case is quite small: 7.38"" x 4.70"" x 1.30"" (188mm x 119.5mm x 33mm). i'm estimating that the cost to build will be around $150 - 200. i realize that something like a novation launchpad can be bought for the same price, but money is not a reason to DIY.

finally, this is not an advertisement or any kind of offer to sell the kit. i don't even have a finished prototype yet. however, i do have a working circuit board prototype for a previous iteration of this design with 95% working firmware. i'm just looking to get feedback on the overall functionality.

thanks!

I have a few chains of audio going on here, pretty nifty

*1. Mic &gt; Duet 2 &gt; Ableton (looper) &gt; Duet 2 (Out 3) &gt; Eventide Pitchfactor &gt; Stereo Radial DI*

(all the while a max for live patch written to interact with Ableton's 'Looper' is controlled by the bottom row of buttons on the Keith McMillen Soft Step midi controller on the floor, the top row controls the guitar Pitchfactor's presets)


2. *Guitar &gt; tuner &gt; Eventide Pitchfactor &gt; amp*

USB Motu Microlite MIDI router receives program changes from ableton midi clips, sends them to the Pitchfactor midi in's and tells each Pitchfactor pedal which preset to jump to, within ableton these clips are mapped to various APC 40 buttons. Fun times.

3. *Ableton play back tracks &gt; Duet 2 (Out 1/2) &gt; Radial Stereo DI #2*

It sounds pretty great through a big system, trying to think of ways to improve it all, but this is the most compact variant. The best part is really the fact sound guy's only job here is to plug in 4 XLR's into my Stereo DI's. Nice to have them and not rely on the club's shit. That way, I don't have to constantly be fixing my levels in ableton. Ready. TO. PLAY.

All of this fits on a Pedal Train 2, or whichever those big guys are, straight into the robust hardcase. Happy.
Good.

For those who don't know AutoHotkey is basically an application that alows you to create your own hotkeys for any program you want. It's based on a pretty advanced scripting language which means you can make some crazy stuff with it.

I'm only learing but here's what I've come up with so far:

    #ifwinactive, ahk_class Afx:00400000:0:00000000:01900015:00000000
    
    MButton::
    Send {Ctrl Down}
    Send {Alt Down}
    Send {LButton Down}
    return
    MButton Up::
    Send {Ctrl Up}
    Send {Alt Up}
    Send {LButton Up}
    return
    
    xbutton1::numpadadd
    return
    xbutton2::numpadsub
    return

    VKC0::+Tab
    return
    

It's very basic but it works. The script does three things:

* Makes it so that I can use middle mouse button as a touchscreen-type-navigation-scroll-thing (instead of Live's default ctrl-alt hotkey). Much more comfortable instead of using scroll wheel and time ruller in my opinion;
* Mirrors the hotkeys for zooming in and out on extra buttons on my mouse;
* Mirrors the hotkey for switching betwen the bottom instrument/effects view and clip contents view on tilda key.

So feel free to share the scripts that you are using.",,False,self,t5_2rbt4,False,,,True,t3_1649oa,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/1649oa/how_about_some_autohotkey_scripts/,

So I joined a band and they want me to play keys live. Cool, but how the hell do I switch patches without fumbling a bunch of sweaty mouseclicks? 

At first I thought it made sense to assign Track Arm Record to each voice, but I soon realized that, for whatever reason, LIVE does not permit MIDI calls for this button. 

The answer is Chain Selection. 

Fig.1 http://i.imgur.com/VyoD4.png
From the above image, you can see that you create a MIDI track, then add an instrument rack to it. Boom. 

Fig. 2 http://i.imgur.com/px9Mr.png
Here You can see the names of some of the songs from our live sets. For 'Darkness' you'll see two instances; each of these is in fact an instrument rack with the reFX Nexus loaded, with different patch assigns for each rack.

Create an instrument rack for each patch you want access to during a live session. Now the little doo-hickeys called Zones (dark blue bars) are the MIDI ranges captured by the chain selector. First, right click in the ruler area, turn on chain selector filters, now assign a block of MIDI channels to each rack instance (in this example I've assigned 0-9; 10-19; 20-29, etc.). Now right click the ruler again and assign to a macro (in my case I assigned macro 1).

Now MIDI map Macro 1 to a potentiometer on your control surface (tweedly knob or slider). Boom. Done.

Now as you slide or twist the dial, your presets will pull up without any interaction with the computer.",,False,self,t5_2rbt4,True,,,True,t3_itxr5,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/itxr5/til_how_to_setup_patch_switching_in_a_live_live/,

Longtime lurker and Ableton Live user, here. I've recently purchased an AKAI MPD32 controller and I've been having some trouble utilizing it to it's full potential in Ableton Live 9.

I've been through a bunch of tutorials. blogs, forums, etc and I can't seem to find anything really helpful.

I was wondering if any other MPD32 users can provide tips or advice on how they utilize the MPD as well as general workflow suggestions. 

Additionally, I'd really love to know how to configure the midi sync so that the Note Repeat feature works as intended. No one seems to have the answer for that.

I'd really appreciate any advice or feedback anyone can provide! 

Edit: [Discovered the nativeKONTROL MPDRx template which looks cool too. ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjT7O5uFR8w&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Edit #2: Found another possible fix for dealing with the Note Repeat syncing issue.

-On the MPD32, set midi to EXTERNAL (The default setting is internal and needs to be reset each time the unit powers up) 

-Tap the note repeat button and then hit edit on mpd. Change the swing to 50. It is set as 58 on default 

-In Ableton's preferences, go to the midi window MPD output and hit the dropdown arrow. You need to alter the delay sync otherwise it works like two audio files that are in ttempo but not together.  It helps to have a midi track of a 1 bar recording, hold down a sound coming out of drum rack, set MPD to 1/4 and adjust the delay untill you can see that the notes get laid down exactly on the right spot when recording.

Most clubs have a DJ booth, but usually they have their own gear, and I'm not interrested in placing my laptop + controller on top of their gear for various reasons. The only place I've played so far with the APC40 so far, I had to use a small table which was way too low and uncomfortable.

I would need a setup that can get the controller to a decent height, and support both the controller and my laptop.
I've been looking around for good solutions, and so far [this](http://imgur.com/a/FKU60) caught my eye. I don't use a keyboard so it seems a tad overkill, though I really like the idea of stand that doesn't need any table and can just be placed anywhere.

I've got it arranged exactly how I'd like it, and am now ready for the mixing and mastering stage.

I kind of mix roughly as I go, but I've heard its best to treat mixing as a separate process. I've read a ton of tutorials on the theory of mixing, but so far haven't found anything Ableton specific. I'm curious to see what other people are doing, and how they set up the effects, automation and controller mapping to make the mixing and mastering process quick and efficient. Here are a few questions I have:

-Is it better to ""start from scratch"" (i.e. take all the existing EQs and compressors off and re-add them as needed) or can I build off of my existing rough mix?

-Tips for mixing drums within a drum rack?

-Do I REALLY need to bounce every track to audio and mix that (i.e. take out all the VST's)? I've seen several tutorials mention this but it seems more trouble than its worth.

-Tips for what effects to put on the master track?

-(this may be dumb/obvious but...) If I have synth that's playing solo for a few bars, then gets joined by other instruments, do I need to increase the volume during the solo part and decrease it when instruments join? Basically, do I need to manually fill in the space left by the other instruments (by increasing the volume) or is this sort of automatic? 

-Best way to record volume automation - do I record myself ""riding the faders"" a lot, or just find a good level for each track and have it stay the same level the whole song? I have an MPK49 keyboard with 8 faders that are auto-assigned to the first 8 tracks, is there a way to make these switch over quickly to control tracks 9-16 or 17-24?

I got my start using computers and software so I feel at home using a DAW.  Started looping stuff in Soundforge / Cooledit / Acid and some sequencing with Making Waves.  Moved on to Cubase and stuck with that for pretty much all my work to this point.  I've tried other DAWs like Sonar, Reaper, Logic, and even SAW if your remember that one.  I've been using Ableton on an off through various versions and there are some things that I really love about it.  I love how flexible Live is and how fast a can get ideas down (kind of).  Mostly I love not having to worry about a dongle.  So I'm trying to make the move to Live and before I drop the money on Live or Suite 9 I've got to get my workflow issues under control.

I use a lot of VSTi's since I don't have a ton of hardware.  I also do a lot of sample based drums (chops / loops / etc).  The problem is I want to use live to basically record the first portion of my idea with out a grid / click / warp or whatever.  Then I want the get the tempo to match that.  This would help a good deal in my workflow.  I have a few different midi controllers but nothing mapped out which I think would help too.  Currently I have M-audio Axiom 49 (original version) and Akai MPD 32 (really wish I got the 36). I have two other smaller controllers for portable use Korg Nanopad 2 and a Akai LPK25.

TLDR; Need help with workflow.  Things like recording without a click and then syncing tempo to recording.

...what have I done?

I've used Logic... I'm produced tracks in Logic and mixed my vocals over instrumentals in Logic, etc... but recently(by recently I mean, almost 2 years), I've been getting into the EDM type stuff and I want to start using Ableton to produce EDM music on my Mac and use either Ableton or some other DJ software to perform and create mixes. Here are my issues:

* I'm brand new to Ableton. I know it's a solid choice for producing electronic music. And besides that, I know little to nothing else about it. I've been playing with it, but all I can seem to get is 3 different MIDI tracks set up looping 4 bars over and over again. Then I don't know what to do &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
* I have no MIDI keyboard. I'm using the musical keyboard (yay).
* I also have Sylenth1 (it makes funny noises). Thinking of getting Maschine...and Battery 3.
* I've been looking into MIDI controllers... the APC40 appeals to me but it looks like the learning curve would be from here to the moon for me right now. Any other options? At some point or another, I want to DJ and from what I'm hearing and seeing, the APC40 will let you DJ with it, but like I said, it looks slight complicated...in terms of DJing..
*The most experience I've had is on partycloud.fm (I've actually ""DJ'd"" at a hookah lounge on my laptop with that site, and had no complaints :D). I've never used a controllers for DJ-ing, or producing.

Low budget MIDI controllers - where to start, what to get?
Low budget DJ equipment - What I should know, what do you recommend?
Ableton Live?!?! - I don't know what patches are or side chaining is or have a full grasp on all the terms I should know. I'm not looking for something in particular (so I can't just search...Ableton Live How To...), I just want to know it all from start to finish, but in the simplest terms possible, and explaining things along the way instead of assuming I know every term associated with the software and it's capabilities.

Thoughts anyone? Any ideas of really cool uses for this thing? Or ideas that spring to mind now that you know that this exists?

I work at Best Buy and get a decent discount on desktop towers.

From what I've read I think 8GB of RAM is plenty.  It has 4 USB 3.0 ports which I've also heard is a must have for a good Ableton rig.  

Would this be a good purchase for what I'm trying to do or are there things I'm overlooking?

And so did I. I was searching for a warm sound, and the Grand Piano Mellow could do the job. Yet even in preview mode I didn't like the tuning of it. I've already had a midi information with different volume and velocity levels to sound more ""true"", so I placed this patch on it and... it was a disaster. The notes from 2 and 3 octave do not just match with 4 and 5 (the more the difference, the more dramatic effect is). My ears are bleeding. I've replaced it with GP Solo, because GP Equal Bright Solo made it better but not that much better.
The most out-of-tune note is G4, it just can not match B1 and D2. If you put a reverb on top of that all, you will notice it even more.

So now I'm listening to the Giant (from NI Komplete 9) and really thinking of upgrading (Currently owning Komplete 8), because I love the sound and the tuning. I love Alicia Keys even more talking about the sound.

So I just warn you - most of the Grand Pianos are slightly (1/8 - 1/16) detuned, with the Solo being the most comfortable to listen, others just do not fit. But the Solo piano is way too straightforward and has a simple pop sound, nothing special about it, I just don't like it that much so I could use it.

1. CMD drag to a Drum Rack pad now creates an instrument rack where in Live 8 it created a chain/multi rack. I have no idea how to create a chain in a drum pad now so layering drums is such a hassle :'(


2. Clicking anywhere on an automation line while my pencil is OFF will still create a point...wtf? fo reels dogg? my pencil is OFF come on now.


3. Clicking and dragging an automation point will drag my whole fucking automation line instead of just that one point. Let's say im on my Auto Filters freq and my automation point is at 15khz and my next point is at 12khz. If I want to move my 15k point ANYWHERE it will drag the 12k along with it. I'm like ""NAH BITCH JUST DRAG THE ONE FUCKING POINT I'VE SELECTED, MY GOSH""

4. Why is the browser so fucking stupid? Like really, browsing is the last fucking thing it does because I have to designate a root folder for fucking everything. Live 8 literally let me browse, this doesn't. I got like 80gbs of beat related shit dogg, I can't live like this. 


5. What happened to ALL the cool Audio Effect Rack presets from Live 8? There was a shit load in 8 and there's like four in Live 9. I really liked fooling with pre-made racks.

6. Lastly, WHY DOES IT ALWAYS OPEN UP BLANK SETS THAT LOOK GOOFY AS FUCK?? My returns take up half my screen and my vol sliders are so long. I know I can just drag them all, but it's a fucking chore to do it EVERYTIME. I'll open up my returns when I want them to return Ableton, thanks. 


that's really it. 1, 2, and 3 are the things that REALLY bother me though. Like they literally fuck up my day.

I have done this in the past, and it wasn't so much of a headache, because it was very sporadic, only a song or two.  Now it's practically every song with different functions in each. 
 
I have two controllers, a little Oxygen8 and an Alesis ControlPad to trigger samples, notes, and sequences (both connect via usb).  

I also run some sequences and midi instruments in the session view and keep a click going to keep myself in time. 

Our keyboard player also sometimes uses my machine to play on board instruments.  He connects through my Presonus Firestudio (with acceptable latency, but it could be way better.)

I run into a Mackie PA system through said firestudio, using the outputs number 3 and 4 for the main output.

I Monitor certain sequences and sounds through the cue out, which is assigned to outputs 1 and 2 this goes to headphones and also carries the click.

If the keyboard player is running through my gear (only two songs now) I divert the master channel routing through output seven, (so I can include the sends) which goes to his amp.

Now, I have ""Live"" sets for each song, so they will already be routed when they are open, but I would love to have a more ""Master setup"" with the all songs included so it would take less time between songs, but there are so many variables, I don’t know how to get this done.   

Any suggestions to make this easier, and to get faster transitions?

Gives me a headache just reading it back.  :0

I am playing live instruments with a band, over tracks triggered in Live. I've got all this figured out.

The thing I need help with is that we are projecting backdrops behind us during the show. The backdrops change with each song because there is one song per scene (it's a theatrical production). 

Some songs however require a backdrop change **during the song**. So here's the catch. I've got my hands full with a million other things and it would be fabulous if I could automate the image changes somehow to be sync'd with the music. As in, press play, the image crossfades to the next image. Then 2 minutes into the same song it crossfades to the next image/video clip or whatever.

Is the best way to do this by using Max MSP? I'm finding image control tricks for Live, but this is a bit different from triggering an image with a button. It's more like assembling a clip that triggers audio, images and video in a timed sequence. Any way to do this?

",shiitake,8,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/1ajrex/new_to_ableton_and_trying_to_figure_out_the_best/,"This is for a 3-piece band that consists of several synths and a few drum machines (Korg Electribe, Akai MPC1000). Currently I'm using my Alesis Micron as the master midi clock and we're splitting the signal to everyone else with a 1-to-4 midi splitter. 

I'm a longtime user of Reason and Sonar so I'm familiar with working with DAWs but neither of those options are really great for playing live. My goal is to use Ableton with a Novation Launchpad to trigger several samples.

Here's where I'm kind of stuck and could use some feedback:

1. Since our songs' BPMs vary I've got a single live set configured with a single scene for each of our songs. The problem is moving between the scenes so that the BPMs take effect. The only way I can see to do this is to start playing each scene which starts playing all of the samples. 

2. Setting up Ableton to be a slave for the midi sync clock seems extremely buggy. I'm using a USB midi cable but every time I change the tempo on my Micron it seems to just get disconnected.  We're using the Micron as the master clock because it sends the midi clock without having to send a start/stop. This is preferable since a lot of our songs don't start with the drums.

I got an Allen &amp; Heath Xone:K2 MIDI controller last week and realised that Ableton does not recognise MIDI release commands as a separate signal and that the main ways to do this involve Bome's MIDI Translator (expensive), Max for Live (expensive), by buying a special template from Ill Gates (expensive) or somehow using MIDIPipe (Free but undocumented x complicated) and I wanted a way to do this natively inside of Ableton without third party software.


I spent all day researching on the internet to find that this was a well requested feature and entirely without response from the community.

Everyone called me crazy but I knew in my heart that it could be done.

In the end I managed to refine the method down to a single dummy clip.


&gt;Now you can easily Hold down a midi note to turn on your effect and let go of the note to turn it back off!

So, without further tl;dr I present you with the free PunchFX rack

http://www.everydayswag.org/ableton/PunchFX.zip


The trick was to forget all about MIDI release recognition and focus on the Input signal.


I've done it by having a dummy clip with launch quantization of 1/32 with repeat mode on and loop off.
The first half of the clip sends CC 'on' signal and the second half sends CC 'off' to the beat repeat.
It's constantly being launched before getting to the second half so the beat repeat only knows on until you let go of the clip and it plays out to the end.
The really great thing about this method is that because it uses CC to modify the values so you can assign another MIDI note to the same parameters as the dummy clips and have two separate controls for the same effect.
I've got it set up so that the dummy clips change the beat divisions as well as a knob for MAXIMUM control!



Hope this helps everyone a little bit :D

Ableton has always been used for production for me... Anyhow I had to move and my CDJs were packed away so I decided to try and make a mix on Ableton. It turned out good and I LOVED being able to edit tracks and have precise controls over everything (http://soundcloud.com/opulent/the-chronicles-of-bounce if you want to listen) but the warping sounded truly awful! The worst part was that I was only speeding up or slowing down by a few BPM!

I tried changing the warping algorhythms and I had the best luck with complex or complex pro usually, but even still switch between the different modes each one would bring out some aspect of the song while hiding another. Some tracks seemed to lose details, other tracks seemed to lose perceived volume while still hitting the same levels on the meter, or even worse start clipping! My CDJ's can warp the speed of songs pretty dramatically while keeping the pitch intact using the pitch lock without any loss in quality, so why can't ableton? Am I stupid or missing something??",,False,self,t5_2rbt4,False,,,True,t3_p9md9,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/p9md9/why_does_djing_warping_songs_sound_so_awful_in/,

Coming from a ProTools background I'm really liking the more DAW-like workflow.

But one thing I can't seem to find a good solution for is looping... Seems there are 3 main ways to go about it in live which all have pretty major drawbacks:

   

**Native clip looping**

* can only control loops on the currently active clip.
* no way to double/half the loop length with midi controls.
* loops are stored to the clip so next time you launch the clip it'll jump into the previously set loop without any warning.
* overwrites any loop already set on a clip (can't loop a section of a bigger loop and then jump back into the saved loop like you can with traktor cue points for instance).

**The looper device**

* seems great at first but after dividing the loop in half you can't increase it again; it forgets about the 2nd half of the loop.
* the song keeps playing in the background so when deactivating the loop you don't know where the song will be.

**Beat repeat device**

* allows you to half/double the loop but max loop length is only one bar.
* same as above... The song keeps playing in the background. 

Am I missing something that would help me achieve what I'm after? I know a lot of people are using live for DJing so surely there's a better solution out there.

Appreciate any words of wisdom. Thanks!

I have been using simpler mostly and have run into some problems.  First, I insert a audio file into it and adjust the looping to my liking. Then I make a clip and add a note on C2.  So it plays the note, but if I add a note higher than C2, the sample will play faster, and if I add a note lower than C2, it will play slower.  is there a way to make higher notes that play the sample at the same speed?

Also, if I have an audio file and I crop a bunch of samples out of it, for example in the song whip my hair by willow smith, I cropped out:

I whip my hair back and forth
Just whip it
whip it real good

But the way i play these is by making separate simpler tracks for all of these audio samples.  Is there a way I can map these samples to a drum rack or something so I can play them all on one clip?  Otherwise, my live set is getting littered with simpler tracks.

Before I do though, I just want to say that I had some music theory in my head from like...middle school.  I never did anything with it other than make some silly music to entertain myself in Garage Band.  Other than that, I've no clue.  I got Ableton as a gift (which I asked for) knowing that I was going into this with no clue and would probably wind up shelving it. 

However, after mere hours with Ableton I've found that it is pretty simple to use and brushing up on theory through Youtube along with some basic Ableton tutorials has completely obliterated my video gaming ""habit"".  I sit here and watch tutorials and make the most simplistic drum beats and ""remixes"" of songs already released in multitrack format where ""remixing"" is really just goofing around as everything syncs and anything I've created, a monkey could create.  But I have great fun and get a ton of enjoyment from this.

Anyway... warping may just be that much further ahead than I need to be, but I see everyone who uses Ableton doing it for a variety of reasons.  Chopping samples?  Warp first.  Trying to lay an a capella on top of a drum beat?  Warp first.

So I am guessing that warping somehow helps with syncing things.

Or something...

See the problem is that I have watched so many tutorials on warping that the technical aspects of it are pretty well stamped into my brain.  Keyboard shortcuts and the layout of the interface in Ableton and so forth.

But... I just don't understand what warping IS.  

It seems obvious to me that there is some part of basic music theory that I am forgetting or something because again, everyone is using warp and Ableton seems to be really popular mostly because of the warping feature.

There's also EQ and reverb automations that I'd really like to have available. 

Its a bummer if I'm not overlooking something because Battery seems to be a really nice drum synth so far.

**Edit:** Thought of another issue I was having. The length of my midi notes does not apply to the length of the sample being cued. Say I have a cowbell sample from Battery and I want to do a short short long pattern. Normally with a drum rack I could make the first two notes 32nd notes in length to get just the very beginning attack of the sample and make the last note an 8th note for the full decay. Battery just plays all it's samples at full length regardless of the length of the midi note controlling it.

**Edit 2:** I found a solution to automation. If you open Battery click the sample you want and in the Cell tab change the Channel send under the volume slider to one of the numbers. Now create an audio track change the extension to Battery and then from the sub menu under extension choose your corresponding send channel. Go nuts with automation and effects.

I do this by dragging the file in, warping it/figuring out the key, then re-naming it and dragging the .alc from session view into a crate folder in my browser window. 

I'd like to think I understand warping pretty well, as i've got ~350 done so far - and most of the time it's pretty straight forward and easy - but sometimes I'll be trying to warp something and it's impossible to get it on beat without putting a warp marker ever 4 bars. 

This only really happens on older songs from the 60s/70s/80s/ that I can tell used live drums. to give you an example I just warped this Slave tune (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhR1JCwQMg4) and had to use 12 warp markers to get it kind of on beat. Even then, after getting the first 32 bar section together, the beat just kept falling off the mark after just a few bars. I understand that because the drums are recorded theres a groove and not everything needs to be completely quantized, but it's going way too far before or after the beat to be just that. 

anyway just looking for some tips on on what I could be doing better or differently, and maybe an explanation on why this is happening. Is having my tune cut up with different segments ranging from 110-116BPM on complex pro the only way to go?

At home, in the studio, everything sounds great.  We even practiced live at home to the beats and all sounded exactly like we wanted.

However, I just wasn't happy with how my beats ended up sounding in the monitors on stage.  This was a venue that has a great sound system too so I can't just blindly blame that.  They just sounded a little thin, stale and inconsistant.

I am guessing the answer lies in master eq and compression...but I just can't seem to find the right balance.  I was just wondering if anybody had any specific tips or tricks on what is needed to transition from the studio to a live setting.

I guess what is plaguing me is the fact that I can't just go by ear because in my studio...it sounds like I want it to sound.

Also the keys on the MiniMoog were nicer feeling than my midi controller. So, I just wanna ask /r/abletonlive, what do you think about hardware synths vs their software emulator counterparts?

As of right now I just load each plugin in a MIDI track and switch through them via my keyboard (for different patches in the songs) but I'm not sure if there is a more organized way to set things up.

I also want to know how I would connect my laptop to the PA system of each venue? Would I need a USB/firewire box? If so would it send stereo signals (for panning loops and such)?

I couldn't really find a hip hop/rap producing forum or anything so I am posting this here as I would like to use Ableton.

I have always really been into music and lately have really been into rap/hip hop beats. I never seriously considered trying to make anything of my own for whatever reason. Luckily I got over that and I am ready to take the big step but I need to sort some stuff out and I hope you can help!

First of all where should I start exactly? It seems that tutorials like Tom Cosm's are more directed at electro house and other electronic genres and not so much rap/hip hop, so is there a decent tutorial that is more directed at what I want to learn? It is also hard to find anything that is structured for some reason. I just come across a lot of different tutorials that are over tons of different topics. Its hard for me to follow these videos without understanding the basics of Ableton and music making in general.

So lets say I start and I am really enjoying myself and decide to get some equipment. What should I get? I looked up a list and it mentioned things that most producers use like a keyboard, mpc, computer, record player, phono preamp, and a bunch of other stuff. 
What gear is priority? I guess it would be the record player/phono preamp and a ton of vinyl, then the mpc or keyboard.

Speaking of vinyl is sampling from vinyl better than if I were to sample from mp3s? I know better is super super subjective but it seems like vinyl samples are a little more forward and powerful sounding, or maybe I am just hearing things. However, it seems that digging is a really popular thing for producers. Going out and buying random vinyl and coming across something amazing to sample from that no one else has sounds exciting. Also I feel like I get a little overwhelmed with the unlimited mp3 thing. Its hard to get a lot of different songs in bulk (whereas i could just buy a bunch of vinyl at a garage sale or something and get a good assortment) and if I forced myself to work with what vinyl I bought I would probably get more done, its hard to sit at my computer and force myself to work with my music collection when it is so easy to go online and try to find something better. Also I feel like finding the record and sampling it myself might give me more of a feeling of accomplishment personally. And I would have a bunch of vinyl which would be cool.

What about music theory? What do I need to learn? What can I learn from?

Thanks!

Right the only VST's I have are the one's that come with Pro Tools and Addictive Drums.  I really need to get some new ones, but want to get the most bang for my buck.  I do some sampling, but I mainly like to do everything with virtual instruments and drum machines.  Will Suite be able to cover all that?  I don't want to get it and then find that it doesn't offer as much as it seems.

I know this is possible through workarounds such as printing audio from Live and then importing into the other DAW, but you can't change a print after the fact, and many of us don't have the CPU and RAM power to be using the ReWire protocol, which is a workaround itself.

Suffice to say, my mind is blown.  Things that used to take me serious time and meticulous editing (lining up vocals, making loops, etc) are done automatically.  

To give you an idea, if I wanted to get two audio files lined up in Reason, I would:

* Use tap-tempo or an analyzer to find the BPMs of the original tracks
* Change the tempo and cut what I needed in Audacity
* If it was a beat, throw it into Recycle to create a loop file.  If it was a vocal, I'd have to import it is a sample into NNXT
* Hope to god they lined up
* Inevitably have to redo all of that when they didn't line up the first time
* Sometimes just give up because I lose patience after a while

But in Live it just...does all that.  Like, it's just done.  Sorry if my thoughts sound fragmented, but I'm seriously blown away.

Anyway, I already know a bit about what I'm doing, and most tutorials that I find start at the very *very* basics (i.e. what different waveforms are, how synthesizers work, etc).  I'm already past that.

Not that thats bad, I learned a lot from these type of videos.

Currently, I have each song in my band's set assigned to a single MIDI channel. This includes one Instrument Rack where I can split up the various sounds across the octaves of the MIDI controller. I then assign certain samples and loops that are sitting in various clip slots to keys on the keyboard, or buttons that are also using that single MIDI channel. Some of these samples need to be quantized to the metronome, which I send to the drummer so that the loops can be in sync with the drums. As far as I know, this means I can't use the sampler or the drum rack to trigger these samples, they need to be assigned to clip slots.

The problem I'm running in to is that now we have a hell of a lot more than 16 songs, so I need to be able to swap in and out songs and assign them to different MIDI channels. Doing so with the Instrument Rack is easy, but as far as I know, this means I'd have to manually reassign every sample clip to the new MIDI channel.

I'm wondering if there is an easy way to take a group of Clip Slots and keep the MIDI assignments, but just change the channel that is assigned to them? I realize this is a rare case, so I'm not keeping my hopes up. :}

And the issue here is when I go to open the file in AL9 it defaults to a temporary 'unauthorized' copy where i can't save or export because the AL9 standard doesn't come with the Sampler. Of course it goes back to 'authorized' when i restart ableton
Now I don't particularly want to flat out buy the sampler just so I can have my project back because I just spent $300 on AL9.... So can anyone give me a how to fix this without doing anything illegal?


**Edit** Okay what appears to have worked is opening the project in live, exporting the track and deleting the instrument, then Re-authorizing ableton, thanks everyone!",,False,self,t5_2rbt4,1363229498.0,,,True,t3_1a7cs0,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/1a7cs0/opening_ableton_live_8_suite_save_in_ableton_live/,

1362693559.0,4,self.abletonlive,19vdwk,Step Sequencer using Launchpad and padKontrol,darlingpinky,6,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/19vdwk/step_sequencer_using_launchpad_and_padkontrol/,"I posted this in the Ableton Live forums but got no response. Hoping this subreddit will have someone that could help me out. Here's the original text of the post:

&gt;Anyone know of a way to create a step-sequencer using a Launchpad to select the note and padKontrol to enter the steps for the selected note? I recently purchased a padKontrol and have already had a Launchpad. On the Launchpad, I've been running LPC-Live (nativeKontrol - http://www.nativekontrol.com/LPC-Live.html) which provides capability to step sequence, BUT only on the Launchpad itself. It doesn't provide capability to extend the sequencer to another device. I've seen that nativeKontrol also has a preset for the padKontrol called pKC, but that also only provides capability to step sequence only on the padKontrol. 
&gt;
&gt;Ideally, I would like to step-sequence like the following scenario:
&gt;
&gt;1. On the Launchpad, I would select the note to sequence using one of the 64 grid buttons.
&gt;2. The ""steps"" would be shown on the padKontrol. Each of the 16 pads would be a step.
&gt;3. The current step marker would move from top left to bottom right of the pad matrix for each iteration of the loop.
&gt;4. When I hit a pad, that particular step would be enabled for the selected note with the velocity that I hit it with. 
&gt;
&gt;So this sounds simple enough, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to do it. I'm okay with custom scripts or just some technique that extends Live's functionality. Really anything. If anyone has any input, it'll be greatly appreciated. If my explanation was unclear, please post back and I will try to clarify by either posting a video or going into more detail.",,False,self,t5_2rbt4,1362944611.0,,,True,t3_19vdwk,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/19vdwk/step_sequencer_using_launchpad_and_padkontrol/,

Specifically, I just bought a Novation Impulse 49 (fantastic keyboard btw) and I don't know how I would do the following:

- Select a track, have a countdown over one bars and then be able to play a short part/loop that would be made into a clip.
- Switch to a different instrument (from the keyboard) and record another part that would be recorded to a clip as well, although obviously under the new instrument.
- Continue recording parts for different instruments, but also record different parts for instruments I have already recorded something for, so I have variations instead the same melodies and lines over and over again.

Also, I can't seem to figure out the looper for the life of me. How does messing with quantization within the looper change when the loop ends, do you just set it to 1 bar so the length is correct? How do you know what tempo to play at without the metronome, can you have it play a click just for the first couple bars you play then not the rest?

Any help would be awesome, I really want to jump into messing with sounds and different ideas but until I know how to do these things it's really hard to do. Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2rbt4,False,,,True,t3_19sg3t,http://www.reddit.com/r/abletonlive/comments/19sg3t/problems_using_ableton_live/,

My problem is the kind of midi message I get doing this. I guess the loopers multipurpose-button needs fast on-off message?
