Kessel has exercised his Boston demons, our young stars are coming out and showing that they can play these tough situations, Reimer is proving not only to be a #1 but one of the leagues top goalies, and this is valuable experience for all of our young team.

I don't think anyone would have expected us to push Boston to game 7, espesially after that heart breaking OT loss in game 4 which was ours to lose and the domination by Boston in Game 1.  Who knows what happens tonight. Either way I'm so proud and happy for this team and super excited for the future of this organization :')

Win or lose tonight, we showed that we didn't just squeak into the playoffs to be manhandled. This isn't just a flash in the pan. Our young, inexperienced playoff team has gone toe-to-toe with the 2011 Stanley Cup Champs and are one win away from eliminating them.

im bored and heading to my buddies house in ottawa for the game but i decide to longboard downtown for a bit. when i get there i ride four stations past the one i was supposed to originally be at on my longboard cause it was nice but chilly. since it was cold I put my leafs jersey on.
At univerdity of ottawa there is 60 leafs fans in jerseys across the transit way. they invite me over and say they have an extra ticket fr 60 bucks. I say im poor. They all chip in five bucks and buy me the ticket. Leafs win 4 0 in a blowout game and I was at the center of it. Tried for a month to buy a ticket to this game with no luck.
A bunch of the people on that bus offered me beers and treated me like an old friend. Today was a good day.

EDIT: to be fair it was a sens fan who sold the ticket. He was a ggg.

This kids always going on about what the leafs need to change to get better, who needs to get called up from the Marlies, etc.

 Carlyle's summer place is just down the road from where all of my family lives, and we're all familiar with Randy, being in a very rural area, so my uncle asked if he could bring his grandson to Randy's to have a chat.

Randy agreed and earlier this week the two went over to Randy's for a visit. The kid was a little shy at first, but eventually got to talking strategy. He disagreed with Randy changing the side Phaneuf played on, among a few other issues, but afterwords he felt satisfied with Randy's reasoning.

 The kid brought with him a poster of Randy in his playing years, which was signed, and a small hockey photo of himself. He was extremely excited to hear that Randy would keep the picture above his work desk. He also received a Leafs t-shirt from Randy.

Since January, when I first heard the motto of the Randy Carlyle’s Maple Leafs, I thought it an interesting choice. Certainly it’s inspiring, powerful, and an awesome reference for history nerds such as myself. But I had never been able to decide if it was appropriate for this young squad, with both inexperience and a bright future. 


Until now, that is. Until we go into Game 5, down 3 games to 1 against the Bruins after the most heartbreaking loss I’ve seen in nearly a decade.


Burn the boats.


It means don’t think about the future. It means there is no future. Staring elimination in the face, there is nothing past the game at hand. There is no “if we win this game” or “lose this one.” The Leafs, who have spent all season looking ahead, looking forward to the playoffs, have to for the first time look downward.

They cannot look at the almost insurmountable climb they face to win the series, they can’t think about Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. They can’t think about after the game, or overtime, or even the next period. Every shift, every play, has to occupy 100% of the thoughts of the Toronto Maple Leafs players.


Burn the boats.


It means leave absolutely nothing behind, nothing for later. It means giving everything you have on every shift, every check, every pass, every shot. It means if we get a lead we play as if we’re down by a goal. It means taking it to the Bruins like every shift is the last one, because if we don’t, ironically, that will be true. Come game time on Friday, there is no Game 6, no Game 7, no games beyond this one. No boats.

He was only 8 or 9 years old at the time but he can still recall the intensity of Foster Hewitt's play-by-play and has said that TV never truly captures that feeling.

In 1952, my Grandpa was the first person on the block to purchase a TV so that he and my Dad and the neighbourhood kids could watch HNIC.  They watched games together almost every Saturday throughout the 50s until my Dad married my Mom and moved across town in the 60s (interestingly, their honeymoon featured a Leafs-Wings game with Gordie Howe at Maple Leaf Gardens!).

My Dad rarely speaks of the post-expansion era aside from the occasional comment on Sittler and Salming and ""the Ballard era"" goes unmentioned in his house to this day.... Can't blame him for that.  

My Grandpa died in 1979 and I was born three years later.  I was indoctrinated into Leaf Nation during my youth and I was about 10 years old when the Gilmour trade happened and my Dad and I were glued to the TV for those gut-wrenching playoff runs in the early-mid 90s.  Those were the days, weren't they?

Fastforward 20-odd years to today - and I'm 30, married to my beautiful wife, and living across the country from my parents.  My Dad and I spoke on the phone today and he said that after watching interviews with both Lupul and Kadri on HNIC this week, the fire in their eyes took him back to watching the Leaf legends of his youth.  He made a point to say that he's only seen that fire a handful of times in Leafs players over the past few decades and specifically recalled the memory of the Clark and Gilmour days of 1993.  He sounded excited about hockey again and the passion he saw in those guys' eyes had him excited about the Leafs for the first time in years - something I'm sure we can all commiserate with.

I think that conversation really reinforced for me that hockey is more than a sport, more than a game.  Even in years like this one where greed and economics took away from our national pastime, it's hard to stay mad at the NHL.  

As far as the Leafs go, the phrase 'the passion that unites us all' has really hit home for me after speaking with my Dad today.  I don't get to see my parents all that often now since we moved across the country and my Dad has recently had some health problems, including a recent surgery and another one upcoming shortly.  So on Easter weekend my wife and I are feeling a little homesick and I'm sitting here quietly reflecting on that call with my Dad and the fact that the Leafs have been such a big part of my family for so many years - and over three generations.  It's a passion that united my Grandpa and my Dad, and my Dad and me.  Rest assured I'll keep the tradition alive if I'm lucky enough to have a family of my own one day.

I'm going to the game tonight, sitting in reds, gonna scream go leafs go all night and lose my voice. Anyone else going?

We can clinch if we win tonight and Winnipeg doesn't win (they can still get 1 point and we clinch cause of ROW).

I predict Kessel will step back up since he has the most career goals versus Islanders over any other team and we all fell asleep in Washington.

4-2 Leafs, Kessel, Lupul, Kessel, Kulemin (empty net) is my prediction, what are your thoughts?

Things changed quickly for me when I watched Kadri take it to Victor Hedman in February -- I've never seen someone that (relatively) small handle Hedman like that. After that night, I found myself occasionally peeking in on Leafs games, then eventually watching them. By the time Yzerman let Boucher go, I was barely following TB anymore.

I sat quietly on this reddit because I wanted to be respectful to a fan base that I knew was simply better than mine. I expected, especially around the playoffs, to see a bit of vitriol for all of us who'd glommed on just when things were going well, but instead, I found [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/1dcjcf/weve_hit_5000_leaf_fans_here_welcome_to_our_new/). I lurked the whole rest of the season and all through this series.

Needless to say, I can't ever go back. I have never been as emotionally involved in a series in my whole life, including when the Bolts took the Cup. All along the way, I was absolutely stunned by the passion Leafs Nation puts out despite the recent history, to say nothing of the amazing job done by this year's team. I haven't been this broken up by a postseason loss since [my college team lost to Wisconsin in 3 OT at the NCAA regionals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib_rpKdAjac).

Even though I came in on the bandwagon, I won't be leaving anytime soon. I just felt like someone needed to let you all know that this season won you new fans, and some of us don't leave just because the fair weather has ended.

Now that it's the off-season, I need to brush up on my Leafs history. Do you fine folks have any suggestions? I want to go into next season primed and ready, but I don't even know where to begin, given the storied history this team has. Where do you send people who need to know more about the Leafs?

Oh, and *Go Leafs Go!*

I think Bozak is a way better player than he gets credit for as well; he is a pretty complete player. He makes unbelievable passes and is the guy I trust most to score on a breakaway. Combine that with faceoffs, penalty kill, good defensive awareness, I really do think he's a pretty outstanding player. So I'm not sure why he takes as much flack as he does.

Hopefully others see this because I'm not convinced many of you criticizing Phaneuf understand what happened out there.

Phaneuf went for the hit.  Whether it was a bad hit or not depends on your outlook.  He went for the hit because it was going to create a turnover with Kessel in the vicinity -- Phaneuf made a very calculated choice there; and it might have paid off.  When you got Kessel out there, you take chances; Kessel can make scoring chances appear out of nowhere.

Unfortunately, Horton moved just enough that he managed to chip the puck out and take the hit on the knee.  Horton basically sacrificed his knee, body, whatever... to make that play.  That's guts.  That's playoffs hockey for you.

Phaneuf knew that Kessel had the speed to catch the passing option and that the trailer wasn't going to catch up.  

O'Bryne gifted a shooting lane to Krejci.  And you know... O'Bryne's has to be one of the slowest defensemen in the NHL.  He didn't even pressure Krejci to MAKE a pass.  What the fuck, Ryan?  At least do something.  

Conclusion: Phaneuf made a calculated choice and it could have gone either way.  I like the risk and the decision making behind the hit.  I hate the result.  I still love Phaneuf.  

Just to illustrate Phaneuf's value: The Bergeron line has four points collectively.  Four. Fucking. Points.  Wow.   That's incredible work by Phaneuf and Gunnarsson.",,False,self,t5_2r8hf,1368112799.0,,11,True,t3_1e06nv,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/1e06nv/in_defense_of_phaneuf/,

To all of you cunts that keep saying ""oh don't worry, they tried their hardest"" or ""I'm proud of them, nobody thought they could win"" or any other bullshit like that: FUCK THAT, AND FUCK YOU.

What made the Bruins deserve that cup more than the Leafs? Sure, Bruins had more experience, but we adapted quickly, and we learned how the playoffs work. So fuck your experience bullshit. 

Despite the results, we played better in every single game except 1 and 3. We are a faster, and our physicality was not far behind theirs. Don't give me that bullshit saying that Boston is the better team.

Also, Boston is a bunch of fuckin' goons. Who the fuck decides to put the whistles away during the playoffs? I'm pretty sure the same rules still apply in the playoffs. JVR gets and elbow in the face with a bloody/broken nose and no one even hesitates. Of course Boston is gonna dominate physically when they don't call shit. 

Speaking of not calling shit. Marchand. That dirty cunt has been provoking and being a shit-head all game and nothing happens. We win a fucking face-off and he threw a water bottle in the ice. I sincerely hope that fucker gets what's coming to him. 

They only reason Boston won is Rask. That guy has been standing on his head to save shots. Boston has been missing the net all over - not to take away from Reimer. He's played exceptional. 

Basically what I'm trying to say is, Don't give me that shit saying ""We're surprised they even came this far"". If you watched the fucking Leafs you'd notice that we DESERVED to be in the playoffs. We didn't squeak by, or win a fucking lottery. We won games throughout the season and we earned a spot here. 

Rant Over. It's an unorganized mess, but I'm done.

&gt;The Vancouver Canucks made one final pitch around 2:45 Eastern, 15 minutes prior to the 3 o'clock Eastern trade deadline, and the Toronto Maple Leafs declined.

&gt;So, it came relatively close, with Scrivens involved at one point, multiple draft picks, but not close enough for the Toronto Maple Leafs to bite.

He just reported this on TSN.

Mike Gillis has no idea what he's doing.  He wants someone to take Lu's contract *and* give back a roster player and ""multiple"" picks?  Guy's nuts.

I'm one of those guys who thinks the Leafs should get Luongo, but after hearing this, I want Reimer and Scrivens to become the best goalies in the league.

The platinums/golds were half empty, there was no GO LEAFS GO chants when they needed it and all I heard at the end was olay olay. This was a Montreal Toronto game are you kidding me.

I actually tried to get tickets to this game and got scuffed after the asshole says he will sell the tickets to me. Literally was oh I can't meet you at 12 but I can meet you at 2 and then no response, nothing at all, no sorry,  then post is gone of the site I was reaching him through. That was a reasonable deal and the only one I was going to make (240 for greens). I'm happy I didn't buy them but also wanted to point out the cheapest greens you could buy after that were at least 300 bucks. Everyone says oh its a great rivalry and it is but you aren't selling the fucking tickets because you are charging too much and the only people buying them right now are habs fans.


I'm getting sick and tired of it. Nothings probably going to happen but they need to start forcing season ticket holders to fill their seats that's just ridiculous. Stop selling them online to asshole scalpers trying to make 300% profit.

They could cover whatever they like such as history, expectations, etc. And than the sub-reddit discusses their expectations on the player. What does everyone think?

Edit: due to overwhelming support for the idea, we will do that idea. I'll post a sign up sheet on Thursday noon eastern. I'll do a list of 40 with 23 roster players, 5 prospects of the authors choice, 5 AHL players that can make the jump and 7 great maple leads of the authors choice. I'll update the thread tomorrow just because I won't have Internet for a bit. 

Edit 2: The list will be posted tomorrow. And you can sign up by commenting on the thread. It will be a first comment, will get the player. Also please be courteous to other fans and not sign up for ALL the fan favorites.

**Gustavasson vs. New Jersey Devils**

*Stats 4 GA, 0.875 Sv%, 32 Shots against, OTL*



**First Goal:** Sykora gets a beauty feed, takes a shot point blank on Gus. Gus is square to the shooter and explodes off the post to make the initial save. Is down into the butterfly, and in true Allaire style the rebound comes out right in front of him. Leans on his right pad quickly to explode full stretch to try and make a desperation save, obviously he wasn't successful. The quickness and agility it takes to get full stretch though is pretty impressive, and as I said earlier goes to his leg strength. Not a ton I can criticize him for, maybe could of been calmer and slid across rather than go full stretch but play developed too quickly. 


**Second Goal:** Where to start.. Gus as I said earlier naturally has a very wide stance. To compare next time you see him set in the net notice his skates are nearly or are up against each post, watch other goalies and you'll see its a unique stance though very Swedish. He simply can't get his pads down and into a closed butterfly quick enough. His stick is angled out, mostly due to the fact that hes incredibly tall, but in that sort of situation you have to get that with your stick if you can't get into the butterfly quick enough. He was never set or ready for that shot, angle wasn't great and was a bit turned to the side. Has to either get his stick there (choke up on the stick a bit), or be more prepared. Lapse of concentration, thats a shot you have to stop. Also pay attention to his knee pads and the addition (+1,2 etc) of his goalie pads, the + number is how tall the pads are after the knee cradle. Gus and all goalies under Allaire's tutelage normally play with a large number to seal up the five hole. Gus never goes into a butterfly to use that on this play, rather he attempts to squeeze his pads together. Not sure if he isn't comfortable in the style, or what hes thinking to be honest.


**Third Goal:** Very similar to the second goal  but Gus is set and ready for this shot. He tracked the puck across to Poni, but he gets beat through the five hole. Squeezing your pads together like that is done to make sure the puck stays under you and you don't let out a rebound, hes thinking about the rebound before he makes that save it seems. The + number after the knee cradle also means that when you dip into the butterfly with the pads together to squeezing the puck between your legs theres a gap that appears in your five hole. Its difficult to explain but try to visualize the two pads together in a butterfly because of the addition on top of the cradle, know theres a gap of however many inches the pad goes above the cradle between the knees, now try to squeeze the puck to prevent a rebound under you and you rotate your pads and theres a gap. Either way this goal like the second is all on him, stop you need to make.


**Fourth Goal:** Gus comes across to make a good save after pushing off aggressively to get the angle on the original shot. Then on a harmless shot from the point, which appears to be going wide it hits him under his glove arm and he tips it into the net. This has a lot to do with his style and mentality, hes over active, and moved too much on this simple play. He came across trying to make this save and wasn't fully tracking the puck, mental mistake and very poor goal to let in. Also see his position after the goal and you'll see the five hole in the butterfly hes in.


**Notes:** Reimer will start next game, this wasn't a great game for Gus or his confidence. Gus couldn't maintain consistency from period to period, and I think it had everything to do with the style of shot. He was able to make some impressive breakaway saves, and was out to challenge shooters aggressively, but on simple shots we see his struggles to adapt to Allaire's style. This game is a perfect example of him caught between the different styles hes trying to play, and some possible issues with his equipment. Your equipment has to suit your style exactly, and as long as he isn't sure about the style hes going to play it'll be a struggle.

**Other Notes:** Brodeur's new pads seem to be doing great for him, you'll see he added some inches above the cradle and to the width, but neither are league maximum. He is a dying breed, values mobility over size and as he ages and loses some of that agility his game has suffered. The fact he rarely adapts but had made a pad change is a big sign for him, showing he is finnally willing to adapt to the new challenges of the league. His style when he went to make saves is still as interesting as you'll find, playing a very hybrid style. Goes down into the butterfly but often only raised one pad and his torso to make a save. Movement with his hips/torso are amazing as always. His pads and legs swivel while his torso remains perfectly still and independently square to the shooter. The leaf Defense still is weak behind the net, and Gus struggles to play the puck making for an awkward situation where defenseman don't seem sure what to do, on the other side we have Marty who may be the best puck playing goalie ever. 

Hope you guys enjoyed it, I'll do my best to answer any question you have.  


Added Quotes from James Mirtle
&gt; Jonas Gustavsson: “Of course it doesn’t feel good right now. Every time we lose a game, I don’t feel good about it. But obviously when it happens like that, you know you could have done better. That’s what’s going to be in my head maybe tonight. But it's a new day tomorrow. I can't really think about that. That's going to happen to better goalies than me.”

&gt; Ron Wilson: ""I don't know [who plays in goal next]. It's a hard place to play goal, period. We've got to find a way to get them settled down and try to find a way of getting them some confidence. They've got to get to the top of the crease and go from there.""

&gt; Wilson on his advice for Gustavsson: ""Work hard in practice. You've got to work hard in practice and correct your mistakes. You've got to be focused going in, not thinking bad things are going to happen, and nail your style down. Be aggressive. If you're going to make mistakes, don't make passive mistakes."" 

After listening to Audio of Gus on Poni goal he says he was in between pushing to the right and got caught in between. He discusses about fighting for ice time and is okay with the fact he isn't guaranteed back to back starts, agrees he has to prove he deserves each start. Wilson's advice about his style in practice is pretty interesting. Gus has to pick what he wants to do and go one way or the other, seems to be the same in practice.

**History**

Born September 23, 1983 in Fort Saskatchewan, AB, CAN.  Lupul began his career in the WHL on the Medicine Hat Tigers in 2000 and played with them until 2003. In 2002-2003 he competed in the World Junior Championship with team Canada where they finished in 2nd place to Russia. Lupul played in 6 games during the championship scoring 2 goals and getting 1 assist. In the 2002 NHL Entry Draft, Lupul was the Anaheim Duck’s first choice, placing him seventh overall in the draft. During his first year with the Ducks, 2003-2004, he played 75 games getting a total of 34 points in the season. Lupul also played for the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks in the AHL for 3 games that season, along with playing a total of 65 in the AHL in the 2004-2005 season. Lupul then went on to play for the Ducks in the NHL again (2005-2006) along with the Oilers for one season (2006-2007), the Flyers for two seasons(2007-2009), then back to the Ducks for 2 more seasons(2009-2011). 

On February 9, 2011, Lupul was traded to the greatest NHL team. He was traded, along with Jake Gardiner and a conditional 2013 draft pick, to the Leafs for Francois Beauchemin. Lupul has since stayed with the Leafs, playing left wing usually alongside Nazem Kadri. Next year I predict for him to be playing alongside Kadri on center with Clarkson on right wing, giving the Leafs a very powerful, heavy hitting second line. Before the lockout delay of the 2012-2013 season, Lupul, along with Clarke MacArthur, was named an alternate captain of the Leafs. He played for the Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg in the KHL during the 2012 NHL lockout. In the 2012-2013 season for the Leafs, Lupul fractured his right forearm when hit by a slap shot from teammate Dion Phaneuf. He missed 25 games during the shortened season.  Returning on March 16, he scored on his first shift of the game and once again during the second period. Lupul played for a total of 16 games during 2013 finishing with 18 points and a +8 record. On January 20, 2013, he signed a 5 year contract extension worth US$26.25 million dollars with the Leafs.

**Offseason**

Not much news has come up of Joffrey Lupul during the 2013 offseason. Lupul did participate in ESPN’s [Body Issue](http://espn.go.com/espn/photos/gallery/_/id/9428872/image/39/joffrey-lupul-2013-body-issue-bodies-want-espn-magazine).  

**Expectations**

Lupul (in my expectations) will be playing alongside Nazem Kadri and David Clarkson on the Leafs second line. Kadri and Lupul had great chemistry during the 2013 season and I expect this to continue into the next season. This second line will prove (hopefully) to be a very successful line that will make the Leafs stand out as a more dominant, hard hitting team.  Hopefully his line, with the new Clarkson addition, will be a vital part of this team and help the Leafs to plant a playoff position. Leaf fans have very high hopes that Lupul will avoid injury this next season and play a full 82 games. I expect for him to be a point-per-game player putting up 20-30 goals and 40-50 assists. Lupul’s strong gameplay and great leadership make him a vital player to the Leafs chances of victory in next season and many seasons to come.

**Additional Comments**

Lupul is my favorite player followed closely by Kadri. I love to see these two playing together on the same line, but I am aware that many people are predicting for them to be split up next year. I surely do hope they stay together as I think they play great together and they will only improve as Kadri grows as a player and as Lupul gets more veteran experience.

 I am currently living in Dallas, Texas but I was born in Toronto and have always been a die-hard Leafs fan.

I apologize for the inevitable grammar mistakes that I make. 
I sure as hell hope the Leafs can pull through a great season and even have more playoff success than they did last year.

We gave them one hell of a run for their money but ultimately, Boston came through and persevered (Like a dagger in the heart). The media here expects too much from our boys but nonetheless, we did a hell of a good job.

Here is what to do in this situation:

1.**Don't hide, face the loss with pride** (Remember when everyone was like ""BOSTON IN 4""?)

2.**How good was our team, eh?** (Reimer, Kessel, Lupul, JVR- spectacular!)

3.**Remember, we made the playoffs!** (Would you rather we not make the playoffs at all?)

4.**We blew a 4-1 lead** (this is the hardest to get over-bring out the best ice cream)

5.**Don't be an asshole**- there are MANY die-hard Leaf fans that may not take this loss to heart so don't be all  ""AWW, WE BLEW IT!!"" (Some people will be seriously depressed about this)

6.**Be a good sport** -If you see a Boston fan that follows step 4, make conversation and congratulate them!(keep it classy Toronto, don't be a *Vancouver*)

7.**Stay optimistic and be humble**-We all know giving up the lead was heart-breaking, we all know that we should've cleared the puck, we all know BLAH BLAH BLAH. (Admit that we done goofed but remember that there is always next year)


 The Toronto Maple Leafs have exceeded my expectations this season. I've been with this team through thick and thin because this is what happens when you are a part of Leafs Nation. This series was a sneak preview of the magic in the years to come. 

The boats have been burned but Boston manage to steal the treasure. If we have to swim, we'll swim to get what we deserve because Leafs Nation has got passion...

***The passion that unties us all.***


EDIT: Don't get me wrong, you can be mad, but keep the arson to the bare minimum (one Boston pizza and an office building MAX)

Lupul has been often talked about as a leader on the team and during games (more recently) he's been getting the team going when they really need it. He's shown that he wants to stay at the club signing that 5 year deal. If Lupul contines to play near the level he is playing now I think that he would be our perfect captain. The only problem I see is Phaneuf is obviously the captain now and demoting him wouldn't exactly be ideal.

Rather than be blantant like Marchand or shaw, Bolland was very subtle about his slashes.  His nickname is ""The Rat"" after all.  **end Edit** Unfortunately Dave Bolland had an absolutely terrible year.   

In his prime, Dave Bolland was the man.  The best checking center in the NHL for 2 or 3 years, shutting down the Joe Thronton and Sedin lines in the 2010 playoffs perfectly.  He could also chip in some decent secondary scoring with his best season being 2008-2009 where he had 47 points.  Under Joel Quenneville, he was always sent out against the opposing team's best lines and had terrible offensive zone start numbers (think around 38%) but always fared pretty well, despite the odds against him.   

Unfortunately this year, Dave Bollamd was hot garbage.  Despite playing with the leading point scorer in the western conference, Bolland, himself, only managed 14 points in 35 games.  His corsi numbers were terrible as his relative corsi was a -23.3 (again, this happened while playing with Patrick Kane for most of the year and also receiving fairly favorable zone starts with 49.6% coming in the offensive zone, although his QoC was not an easy .072).  His faceoffs have never been good and this year was no different as he only won 46%.    

On the PK, he saw his ice time lessened due to the improvement of Marcus Kruger and the emergence of Brandon Saad and was one of the worst penalty killing forwards on the team as his GAon/60 was 5.96, second worst among forwards.  Not to mention the fact that his cap hit is a not insignificant 3.375 and his injury history is far from pristine.  Frankly, there was a reason he was replaced by Michael Handzus and was relegated to playing with Michael Frolik and Marcus Kruger.   

I really like Dave Bolland and wish him success (especially since he is not in the same conference) but I just thought you would like to hear how he actually was this season.",,False,self,t5_2r8hf,1372717555.0,,,True,t3_1hgew0,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/1hgew0/dave_bolland_from_a_hawks_fan/,

1368250053.0,44,self.leafs,1e469x,How The Leafs Could Beat Boston,caesarfecit,46,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/1e469x/how_the_leafs_could_beat_boston/,"Was Game 5 the best game the Leafs have played this series? No, in my opinion Game 4 deserves this honor. Just think, if the Leafs had scored in OT, it'd be 3-2 Leafs right now. But anyway...

I watched Game 5 pretty closely, and I think I noticed a couple things about Boston's playing style and their weaknesses that were to some extent exposed in Game 5:

- Boston's D is slow. In general, Boston is not a team built for speed. The Krejci/Lucic/Horton line has shown some bursts of speed but the team as a whole isn't, particularly their defensemen. So what does Boston do? They play their defense back, and backcheck hard. A lot of times, it seems like they're playing the trap, but they're not. This is why the Leafs have so much trouble in Boston's end, especially on the initial rush, they can't get behind their D without a turnover or a stretch pass.

- They use hitting and the turnover game to control tempo. The Bruins aren't a speed team, nor a skill team - they're a pure positional play and hitting team. This utilizes their biggest assets - their experience and size. What do the Leafs have? Youth and aggressiveness. The Bruins create turnovers by closing passing lanes, forcing plays with checks. The Leafs demonstrated that they can play this game too tonight, possibly even better, by simply out-skating the Bruins. And with one of the youngest teams in the NHL, why not... you have the legs. 

- Rask is a superb goalie, but I think he has a weakness. Both goals tonight, he could see it coming the whole way, had support to cut off passes, and still got beat. Why? Because he may be able to track the puck like a hawk and has a fast glove, but he's easy to catch out of position. Whether its because he cheats positionally too much or he's slow, I'm not sure, but they're not gonna beat Rask with quick shots, rebound-hunting, or screens. Especially given Boston's strong play in front of their net. They can beat Rask, if they force him to move. 

So what does this mean for Game 6 and maybe Game 7? They can beat Boston if they can beat them at the very things their game is meant to stop: catching them out of position or playing sloppy. They don't have the skill or speed to compensate for either. The soft ice at TD Garden played totally in the Leaf's favor as it hurt the Bruins more than the Leafs in the acceleration department, and created a lot of broken plays that gave the Leafs open ice to exploit. Furthermore, the Leafs proved tonight that they can hold off the Bruins **for an entire period, with the series on the line**. 

So here's my armchair advice for the Leafs:

- Be opportunistic with your hitting. You'll never pound Boston, especially Chara into submission, but taking a player or two out of the play with minimal tempo lost to you could be useful... why u ask?...

- Use the stretch pass. If the Leafs should have one objective next game, it should be to traverse the neutral zone as quickly as possible. Make them skate, try and get behind their D, keep them from forming up 4 men up or 4 men back.

- Use quicker acceleration to keep winning the turnover game. Boston doesn't react quickly to broken plays, in fact many times only a minor miracle by Rask or good positional play saves them. Keep it up.

- Make Rask move. Stop throwing the puck at his chest, you're not gonna get the big juicy rebound. Instead make him move around. If you can keep the puck out of Boston's hands, and force Rask to stay on his toes, you have a better chance of catching him out of position. As noted above, either due to slowness or positionally cheating (probably the latter), he's vulnerable to this. 

Anyway, there's my thoughts...go Leafs go!",,False,self,t5_2r8hf,False,,,True,t3_1e469x,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/1e469x/how_the_leafs_could_beat_boston/,

**History**

Nazem Kadri, aka Lebanon’s Sweetheart due to his Lebanese heritage, was born in London, Ontario. The Kitchener Rangers drafted Kadri with the 18th overall pick in 2006 OHL draft. With the Rangers, he won an OHL Championship and earned a berth to the Memorial Cup, all in his second season in the OHL. The following season, he was traded to his hometown team, the London Knights. In the 2009 NHL draft, the greatest NHL team decided to draft this beauty with 7th overall pick. 


He nearly made the team out of his first NHL training camp, but Ron Wilson decided it was “best” for him to return to the OHL, even though he was the best player in camp. This decision would later prove to be very valuable to the team. Nazem Kadri made the 2010 World Junior roster. The team made it to the finals, but due to poor sightlines from where I was seated in the Credit Union arena in Saskatoon, I can’t tell you who won the game (Oddly enough my memory is also foggy from game 7, so let’s keep it that way). He finished the tournament with 3 goals and 5 assists. He was a major player in Canada’s late comeback by setting Eberle up with a minute and a half left in regulation. He finished the game with two apples. 

Ron Wilson was never a big fan of Kadri. In the 2010-2011 season, Ron Wilson said that “Kadri was running out of time to prove himself”. So Kadri was sent to the AHL to develop under the great mind of Dallas Eakins. Eakins help develop Kadri’s two-way play.

In a lock-out shortened season, Kadri made magic happen all year long. He finally cracked the roster under Randy Carlyle. Kadri started off playing sheltered 3rd line minutes, and he thrived in this situation. As the season progressed, his role with the team expanded and he began to play more minutes. Although Joffrey Lupul played only a handful of games this season, the two demonstrated great chemistry that they can hopefully build off for next season.

thanks to /u/penguintophat for the table

**Offseason**


Once Nonis signs Kadri to a bridge contract a-la Matt Duchene (2years 3-3.5 million), I expect big things from Kadri. Kadri is determined to become a #1C as demonstrated by his offseason training. This year, he is working out under team supervision. He is focusing on improving his stride and his conditioning. These improvements should hopefully help him play more minutes next season. Also if Kadri can improve his F/O% from a paltry 44% it should help our possession numbers and make him a bigger threat.

**Expectations**

Based on the current projected roster for next season, Kadri should play alongside Lupul and the newly acquired David Clackson. I project a slight regression in his point percentage from last seasons. My expectations are 20 goals and 40 assists. The point totals can be much higher if Lupul (knock on the rainforest) can stay healthy for a full 82 games or Kadri is promoted to the top line. Although it would be nice for Kessel and Kadri to play together, I do not believe it would benefit the team since we would be putting all our top offensive players on one line. This would allow the opposite teams to focus their top shutdown unit to focus on one line instead of two. 


Down the line, I hope Kadri can become our future #1Center. He is a feisty player who can score and shows up to win when the games on the line. This can happen if he improves his work on the dot and his skating. This kid can play, and hopefully he helps end the drought in Toronto, because we are thirsty for a drink from Lord Stanley’s Cup.

He was cruising along the beach in the Pope mobile when there was a frantic commotion just off shore. 
A helpless man, wearing a Montreal Canadiens jersey, was struggling frantically to free himself from the jaws of a 25-foot shark. 

As the Pope watched, horrified, a speedboat came racing up with three men wearing Toronto Maple Leafs jerseys aboard. One quickly fired a harpoon into the shark's side. The other two reached out and pulled the bleeding, semiconscious Canadiens fan from the water. Then using baseball bats, the three heroes in blue and white beat the shark to death and hauled it into the boat also. 

Immediately the Pope shouted and summoned them to the beach. 
""I give you my blessing for your brave actions,"" he told them. I heard that there was some bitter hatred between Leafs and Canadiens' fans, but now I have seen with my own eyes that this is not the truth."" 

As the Pope drove off, the harpooner asked his buddies ""Who was that?"" 

""It was the Pope, "" one replied. ""He is in direct contact with God and has access to all of God's wisdom.""

**History**
	
Orr was an enforcer prospect who went undrafted out of major junior, where he played for the Swift Current Broncos and the Kamloops Blazers over the course of five seasons. He began his pro career with the Providence Bruins, who believe it or not are the AHL affiliate to the Boston Bruins. He spent two full seasons in Providence before playing his first career NHL game with the Bruins in 03-04. After one more season in the AHL he played 20 games with the Bruins before being traded to the Rangers, for whom he played 15 games for. It was in New York that Orr found his permanent roster spot, playing on Broadway for three full seasons before signing a four year contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs in July of 2009. Orr made an immediate impact for the Leafs, playing all 82 games of the 09-10 season for them, with 23 fights in that time. Concussion problems and a lack of skating ability hampered Orr's 10-11 and 11-12 seasons, culminating in his being sent down the AHL in 2012. Orr rebounded in the lockout shortened 2013 season however, having 13 fights and arguably being the fighter to beat in the NHL for the season, on hockeyfights.com he was voted both fighter of the year and comeback fighter of the year, the former of which he also won in his first season in Toronto.

**Style**

As an enforcer Orr earns his paycheck mainly with his fists rather than his stick, fighting on a regular basis, almost always early in games and against opposing teams' heavyweights. As a fighter he is known for having an iron jaw, and being one of the hardest punchers in the league. This is not only because of his years of practise, as Orr reportedly has a raised knuckle deformity which makes his punches feel much harder. He was a part of the top fighting rivalry of the 09-10 season, throughout which Orr and Ottawa Senator Matt Carkner fought four times, with Orr earning a 3-1 record, as well as a knockout on Carkner during their third fight of the season. Orr's main weaknesses are his lack of hockey IQ and his skating ability, these often lead to bad decisions with the puck and many turnovers.

**Offseason News**

Orr' had his contract extended going into the 13-14 season, where he hopes to return to his early season form and be a solid contributor on the fourth line. Because of the incriminating photos he and Frazer McLaren have of Randy Carlyle, consider it unlikely that he isn't an every night player for the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Gardiner is a great player, don't get me wrong. Great breakout passes, great offensive mind set, but seriously he is a D-man and he is average defensively at best. Since he has been called back, I haven't seen him play one outstanding defensive game, or even offensive for that matter. My point is, before everyone becomes a critic of the game and on coaching decisions, realize that coaches/experts know a lot more than Gardiners agent or beer league hockey fans. I really hope he steps his game up, and I do have faith. 

edit: I'm not trying to say Gardiner is bad, or won't get better. We have all seen what he can do. Just saying, all factors considered...I'd like to think he could be playing better than he is right now at this point in his development. The best players are confident and adaptable. From watching him play in more recent games, he seems timid, and aggressive at the wrong times.

When my girlfriend and I showed up early for game 6, the bar looked pretty full and the sign out front said ""Sorry Leafs fans, we're full!"" and we disappointedly started walking elsewhere. Before we made it a block away, a man on the corner put his call on hold and asked if we were coming from the Regal Beagle. When we explained to him that it was full, he told us he couldn't bear to see Leafs fans miss out on the game and personally led us in and let us borrow some seats with him at his table before helping us find more permanent seats elsewhere in the bar where we met another awesome Leafs fan. 

The atmosphere inside the bar was phenomenal with plenty of chanting and high-fiving, and everyone was very welcoming.

A big thank you to Jay for helping us catch a Leafs game at the best Leafs bar in Vancouver, to Jeff for sharing his table with my girlfriend and I for the whole game, and to the wonderful Leafs fans in Vancouver for such awesome hospitality.

#### Game Notes
* [NHL.com preview](http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2011020739)
* Phil Kessel, Joffrey Lupul, and Dion Phaneuf return from the All Star Game, as well as Evgeni Malkin, James Neal, and Kris Letang from the Penguins.
* Evgeni Malkin leads the league in points, with 58 coming into tonight's game.
* Marc-Andre Fleury is expected to get the start tonight for the Penguins, with Gustavsson for the Leafs.
* The Leafs' stats have passed some round-number milestones, some good and some bad: they now allow fewer than 3 goals per game on average; their PP is now below 20%; are their PK has reached 75%
* The Leafs have not allowed a goal while shorthanded in 11 games; that streak started after allowing power play goals in 6 straight games
* Toronto snapped their four-game road losing streak against the Islanders last Tuesday.
* Toronto has won 3 of their last 4 games, and is tied for 7th in the standings with Florida and New Jersey
* Last time these two teams met, Phil Kessel tallied twice as the Leafs beat the Pens 4-3.",,False,self,t5_2r8hf,True,,27,True,t3_p4ryz,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/p4ryz/game_thread_leafs_at_penguins_january_31_700_tsn/,

#### Game Notes
* [NHL.com preview](http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2011020340)
* This is the first game between the two teams since the trade that sent Beauchemin to the Ducks for Lupul, Gardiner, and a fourth-round draft pick
* Ex-Leafs on the Ducks include Beauchemin, Hagman, and Blake (who's out with a wrist injury)
* After a 4-1-0 start, the Ducks have gone 2-11-4
* The Ducks are 14th in the West, mostly because they're 29th in the league in scoring ... they're also 29th in the league in goals against at home, allowing 3.27/game
* Selanne, Perry, and Getzlaf lead the Ducks in points, but also in penalty minutes
* *Update*: It appears Grabovski is likely to play in place of Steckel ... Gunnarsson is a game time decision and Aulie is ready to go if necessary",,False,self,t5_2r8hf,True,,16,True,t3_mr9ft,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/mr9ft/game_thread_leafs_at_ducks_november_27_900pm_sn/,

How does saying we should strip him of the 'C' or trade him in the off season get us any closer to beating the Bruins on Friday night?

Why don't we blame Reimer for not cutting the angle better? O'byrne for basically rendering himself useless on the play? We should also blame Frattin for ""only"" hitting the post earlier in the game. At the very least, we should be having this discussion in the off season, not before the most important game in the last 10 years!

We can't act like this. It starts in social media, then goes mainstream, and then you have journalists (who are only doing their job) shoving cameras and microphones in Dion's face asking him how he feels about all his so-called fans calling for his head. All this does is put added pressure on our boys and lowers the appeal of Toronto for any pending UFA's.

That victory went better than I could imagine. I thought that if the Leafs were to win, it would be Reimer stealing the games and us getting dominated all night but somehow managing to win. But that's not what happened. Sure, Reimer was absolutely amazing. Lupul and JVR were great. Gardiner gave us those much needed outlet passes. But there were so many surprises too:

1) I've been pretty hard on Carlyle, and one of my worries was that he didn't have a plan to beat the Bruins other than doing the same crap we've been doing all year. Well, he proved me wrong, and I have to give him credit for that. The lineup changes were focused on the breakout pass and making the team faster, and it worked. And he had a great plan to get Kessel away from Chara, and that resulted in the much needed Kessel goal. Now on home ice that will only get easier, and my expectations are raised.

2) Phil Kessel scores an even strength goal. Hallelujah! This guy always impresses me with his speed.

3) The substitutes. Where do I start? Frattin gave an injection of energy into the lineup. He seemed to be all over the ice trying to hit people and fighting for the puck. Hamilton made significant impact through checks and that sweet through his legs pass to Kadri, who then converted it to Kessel for the game winning goal. Gardiner, though not having a perfect game, improved our zone breakouts greatly.

4) The domination of the Grabbo-Kule-JVR line. They looked amazing all night, they were the 3 best players in game 1 (argument can be made for Komarov), and that JVR goal was unbelievable. They were keeping sustained pressure, which I previously thought was not possible for us. Also, as my friend claims, Grabbo seems to have mutant healing factor. I can't get over how great this line was.

Now I don't want to close on a bad note, but I feel there is one more issue to address: Mark Fraser. That guy is so awful I just have no words. He seems to be covering nobody, his chips along the boards are weak and transparent, and he causes turnover after turnover. I can only hope he gets suspended for his fight at the end of the game and then Carlyle can see how much better then lineup can be without him.

Anyway, my main point is: I'm filled with more hope than ever. This game wasn't just a win, it demostrated a strategy and _method_ for winning that I feel is repeatable. We didn't luck out this win, it was won with great strategy and great play! _GO LEAFS GO_!",,False,self,t5_2r8hf,False,,93,True,t3_1dq8qw,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/1dq8qw/impressive_game_2_win_carlyle_shows_some_signs_of/,

#### Game Notes

* The Bruins have had three days off since their last game Saturday ... after tonight, both teams will have two days off before the rematch in Boston
* Both teams scored four goals in a row in comeback wins in their last games
* On November 5, these teams' last match-up, Toronto had an 11-point lead over Boston ... that lead is now 1 thanks to Boston's 11-0-1 record in November
* Gunnarsson is expected to return from his hand injury
* Colborne, Boston's 1st-round pick in 2008, will skate against the Bruins for the first time since being traded as part of the Kaberle deal
* The Bruins have six players with 30+ penalty minutes ... the Leafs have just one (Brown)
* Boston leads the league in team plus/minus with a +24 (Toronto is +2)

",BlueWhite81,34,5,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/1b1irk/bozaks_value_trade_resign_haircut/,"Listening in to the Toronto radio stations the last couple days, following the likes of Siegal, Dreger and such - most are reporting that the ""Bozak camp"" are looking at, or north of 4M, on a multi year deal on the upcoming contract this summer. 

Now I see Bozak as a serviceable forward, and a decent centre, and don't mind him one bit on this team, BUT he has greatly benefited from a roster handicap of a first line centre absence, and thus inflated his actual value that everyone can clearly see. 
Ideally he would be the perfect 3rd line centre, which is where he would be on most contending teams, so at that slot he is not worth the contract he is expecting as rumoured.   It would be just silly, considering all the other pieces that still need to be signed and obtained. 

I would be fairly disappointed if Bozak is on the team next season as the first line centre, *and* being paid as one.  That's just unacceptable.    I understand the UFA market is bare, with possibly only Weiss, and Ribero available, and it's not exactly an easy trade to pull off - but something has to be done to avoid this from happening.

With that being said, what should be done?  If Bozak asks for what is rumored, Leafs don't bite, and he walks away - that just puts more pressure on this team.   

On the other hand, with the deadline approaching do the Leafs get creative, create a lucrative package around Bozak to get another team to bite? ... although with the slight possibility of team chemistry disturbance with the playoffs just a bend away, on the final stretch. 

TL;DR.   Bozak (rumoured) asking price high, not legitimate first line centre, trade him, or bite the bullet; risk a loss or overpayment.

We have an easy end to the season and the games I can see us dropping are tonight against the Blackhawks, March 19th at Boston, 24th of March against the Rangers (would have played for 2nd consecutive night) at least one of the games against the Flyers, March 11th at the Capitals (another back to back game), and probably playing at home against the Penguins on March 7th

Sorry for my ADD with the dates

I realize this is a stretch and i'm probably being a bit delusional but we don't have any west coast games left and our final opponents apart from the ones above that I listed are 

Habs (x2), Panthers, Lightning (x2), Sens, Islanders, Devils, Hurricanes, Sabres (x2)

That being said I can see us dropping the Panthers game.. they've fucked us all year

Win or lose, some of our Leafs had stellar/really good seasons. We should never forget this year's roster of scrappy little bastards.

#1. Nazem Kadri - Not so far after all. Finishes with 44pts, and provided us with smiles and heroics various times.

#2. Joffrey Lupul - Considering he was gone for most of this shortened season, his numbers are scary good. Great player who has filled the void of a ""leader"" for our guys.

#3. Phil Kessel - Slow start, but ended up #8 in the league in points. Started playing a more developed, two-way game, and is becoming more valuable than he was when we traded for him.

#4. James Reimer - Only times he slipped was when the team completely left him to carry the entire game. That said, on most occasions, Reims has shown us flashes of brilliance, and flashes of Eddie and Curtis. Love his attitude and his respect for the game.

#5. Physicality - McLaren/Orr/Fraser/Komarov and friends. Putting the piss and vinegar back in the game.

I have simply edited and added some bits to improve it, as he was really rushed to write it. And then posting it. So here you go!

**Biography**

Jay helped changed the Maple Leafs from a “Merican” team that Don Cherry hated in the Burke era to a “Good Ole Canadian team” since this player is born in Kingston, Ontario. He was born on March 2nd, 1983, and is currently 30 years old. He played his junior hockey for the Brampton Battalions. During his four seasons he put up some pretty solid numbers. He even made the World Junior squad helping our beloved red Maple Leaf earn the silver medal twice (2002, 2003). The St.Louis Blues drafted Jay in the second round in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, #57 overall. He played seven and a half years in the Blues organization until he was traded to the Colorado Avalanche. Once his contract was over with the Avs, Brian Burke made one of the most underrated free agent signings by bringing in this beauty to our team. Unfortunately his contract is up at the end of the year, so hopefully Nonis does the right move and re-signs Jay to a great contract.

Since Jay isn’t likely to be a big offensive contributor for the Leafs, I decided I would like to outline his impact on the team. He is the type of 3rd/4th liner who can put up somewhere between 20-36 points. But he is arguably the Leafs best defensive forward. His presence improved our pk from a 77.3% (bottom 5 in the league) to a 
87.9% which was 2nd best in the league. McClement led the league in TOI on the PK. He brought in a new attitude to the team and even wore the A when the Leafs were hit by the injury bug. He finished the year with a solid 51.7 FO% and was often taking all the tough defensive zone face-offs with Flozak.

He is a player that I believe Randy Carlyle went directly to Burke and said ""this is a player we need to sign"", and Carlyle has used him effectively on the 3rd/4th lines. His physicality and defensive prowess make him exactly the kind of player Randy Carlyle needs to have success (think Sami Pahlsson on his cup winning team).

**Expectations**

I expect him to usurp Tyler Bozak’s first line center role and put up 40 goals with 30 assists helping Kessel win both the Art Ross and Rocket Richard. 

I kid, I kid. He should continue the trend of putting up between 20-36 points. Hopefully he can play with some other players than the Blue Bombers (Orr and McLaren) but I expect him to center the 4th line while Bolland centers the 3rd. Alternately, McClement could center the 3rd line with Bolland on the wing, having Joe Colborne as the 4th line center.

Jay, Kulemin, Bolland and Bozak should hopefully keep our PK in the top 5. He should keep up his solid numbers on the dot. If McClement plays like last season, he will continue to be a fan favorite. Hopefully he finally gets recognition for the Selke.

**History**

Clarkson was born on March 31st in Mimico, Ontario, a small community within Toronto. Growing up, he played both ice hockey and ball hockey (wearing number 71 in ball hockey; one of the reasons he will wear number 71 as a Leaf), and was a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs and, in particular, Wendel Clark. Clarkson developed into a promising young talent by the time he was eligible for junior hockey. After a solid season with the Port Hope Clippers of the OPJHL, Clarkson made the transition into the OHL with the Belleville Bulls for the 2001-02 season. However, Clarkson only saw 22 games at the OHL level that year with a modest point total of 9, before returning to the OPJHL level with the Aurora Tigers. His 47 point in 37 games with the Tigers helped him to jump back up to the OHL the following year. After 3 games with Belleville, Clarkson was sent to the Kitchener Rangers where he began to elevate his game to another level. His 3 seasons with the Rangers saw him achieve point totals of 28 in 2002-03, 39 in 2003-04, and for the first time in his junior career, above a point-per-game pace of 54 points in 2004-05 (astonishingly done in 31 games). 

Despite being undrafted, this final season made Clarkson a touted free agent, and signed with the New Jersey Devils in August of 2005. Clarkson saw a couple of seasons playing with the Devils' affiliates at the AHL level: the Albany River Rats and the Lowell Devils. After a successful end-season stint with the New Jersey Devils in the 2006-07 season, Clarkson was able to make the Devils team the following year. By this time, he had already established himself as the type of player that New Jersey fans loved: a high level of aggression, toughness, fighting and checking, combined with his speed and offensive capabilities. He was consistently near the top of the league in terms of penalty minutes, whilst still contributing offensively. His 6 seasons with the Devils saw his point-per-game totals continuously improve (aside from a slump in the 2010-11 season) despite being on a heavily defensive team. Clarkson's contract ended after the shortened 2012-13 season, and became an unrestricted free agent. On July 5th, 2013, Clarkson signed a 7-year, $36.75M contract, with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

**Offseason**

David Clarkson was considered the top free agent available after the 2012-13 season. He eventually signed with the Maple Leafs for a 7-year, $36.75M contract. Clarkson has cited reasons for signing with Toronto including Toronto being his hometown and his favourite team growing up, as well as wanting to play for a team he considers to be on the upswing. Several comparisons have been made between himself and former Maple Leaf Wendel Clark, who Clarkson said he is going to try and emulate during his tenure as a Leaf.

**Expectations**

It is the popular belief that Clarkson will play on the Leafs' second line along with Joffrey Lupul and Nazem Kadri. As /u/proffesor_b14 mentioned in his post yesterday, this will round out Toronto's second line as being an offensively talented trio with unrelenting aggression and grit. It is expected that Clarkson will bring his tough and powerful game along with his willingness to fight to further encompass the identity that Nonis and Carlyle are trying to adopt with this team. It is my personal expectation that Clarkson's offensive game will reach new heights with a more offensively-minded team and highly talented linemates. I would like to see Clarkson hit 20-30 goals and 50 points in his first season as a Leaf.

Big thank you to /u/JustLeafingAround for providing the template that I used for my write-up, it probably would have taken seven times longer had I not used it. As far as the upcoming season goes, I'm beyond excited to see what this new Leafs roster can accomplish. I realize some of the offseason moves have polarized fans, but despite cap space troubles I genuinely feel as though our team has improved over last year. I'm super excited to see how Clarkson in particular will perform on this team, given that he seems very excited and rejuvenated playing hockey in his hometown. Only 5 more weeks until the preseason and starts, and by then hopefully we have our remaining RFAs locked up. Until then...

**GO LEAFS GO!!!**

However, I haven't heard anyone yet talk about the fact that for his career so far he's been on the Devils. The Devils are one of the worst producers offensively annually so it wouldn't be a surprise that he doesn't have high point totals because the team doesn't score. What they did do though is shut teams down and play a very defensive style of hockey. Something that we need badly. 

So I think that two things will happen with David Clarkson this season, he's going to produce a lot more than his past seasons because he will have much better linemates on a more offensively talented team and he will help make our team much better defensively. 

Everyone seems to forget that we were top 6 in scoring last year, we don't need more help scoring. It's not like our point totals last year were from people like Grabovski and Frattin. Our offensive core is still intact, and we upgraded our defensive core substantially with Bolland and Clarkson. 

I believe Clarkson makes this team much better and this team will make Clarkson much better.",,False,self,t5_2r8hf,False,,84,True,t3_1hxni6,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/1hxni6/thoughts_on_david_clarkson/,

The /r/hockey subreddit has decided to start a [series](http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/1hkh47/update_offseason_discussion_thread_2/) inspired by the other sports subreddits, including /r/nfl. Starting July 14, a team a day will make a posting on /r/hockey about their NHL team. It will be a rundown of stats, history etc. The whole purpose of this is to show the other hockey fans what our team is all about, it's history, current stats and the previous seasons' efforts! Also, this is a great way to show new hockey fans what our team has to offer, and increase the love of the Maple Leaf to other hockey fans! 

With mod approval, I have permission to write the official Leaf post that will be on /r/hockey on August 4, but I will definitely need help from everyone on the Leafs subreddit! I have set up a poll here to gather some data. Here are some of the things I need people to vote on: 

**OFFICIAL POLL CAN BE FOUND HERE** : [Click here for the poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OZ1YEPRlNgiLPPnv5U1i83zUp0b2L7mzlkKD1pUClOo/viewform)

**Notable Players** (5 spots): This category is suggesting the five greatest players to don the blue and white over history. 

**Current Top Players**: (5 spots) Who are the five greatest current Leafs? 

**Rivals!** (4 spots + 1 Honorable Mention): Probably one of the toughest, maybe easiest to others. Who are our rivals? Which teams do the Leafs loathe in the NHL? 

These are the categories that I will need some input in and votes, so please spread the word about this poll! **I will offiicially close the poll on July 31 to allow maximum answers, so please answer before then!** Please use the link provided above so we can see what the general consensus is among us! Some things you can put in the comments below: 

- What were some highs? Lows? 
- What were some key moments of the draft? Did the Leafs fill needed roles? 
- What were the impact of trades?  Please refer back to the original post created on /r/hockey for the template and the questions they want answered! 

Leaf fans, this is going to be a great way to show /r/hockey just what the buzz and hype Leafs Nation is all about, so let's get excited! 

If there are any questions, concerns, comments or ways to improve this, please let me know. This is a collective effort among all of us! Stay tuned for some updates! 

EDIT: Link fix!

This season I have found myself becoming more and more a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs. It's odd actually because I've been an Ohio based Dallas Stars fan all my life. 

I just can't help but take to your great roster and amazing fan base, I wanted to be apart of it!

Was wondering if anyone could give me a solid rundown on how the team looks over the next 5 years? You guys have really good talent all around but I'm wondering what things am I missing?

Some players that I really enjoy watching are Lupul, Grabovski, Kessel,van Riemsdyk, Reimer (of course), and Phaneuf. I'm on the fence a bit with Bozak and Kadri. I really like Bozak but lately have seen a lot of hate towards the guy. Is he not the center I think he is?

They dropped the ball hard in the third period of game seven against the Bruins. No excuses. They took the foot off the gas and ""gave"" the Bruins the opportunity to take the game.  

I learned some things though and these are those things:

1. Grabovski has no quit button. He fought hard all the way. They better keep him. 

2. Reimer is legit. He started late in hockey but that guy steals games and he has shown he can do it consistently.

3. Lupul is an elite talent that had some injuries early on. He is elite. He is as good as people thought he could be.

4. Phaneuf is human. He is good. he is a hard worker. He is skilled. He gets burned from time to time.

5. Gardiner is the future for the Leafs defense. He has speed awareness and skill to make things happen in multiple situations.

6. Kadri is a solid 30-40 goal a year guy. He has skill and heart. I was aware he was skilled. I was impressed at how much heart that guy has.

The game started at 8am here, it's now 11pm, so I haven't slept yet. I'm really hoping sleep can take some of the pain away. 

Used to be a diehard fan, but haven't really followed them for the five or so years I've been here. There aren't any games on TV, and they're all on in the early morning, which doesn't work for streams, and of course nobody here cares about hockey. Plus I knew the Leafs were still terrible, so there was no real motivation to get into them. This year I knew they were doing a bit better, and started following some news online. Considered signing up for NHL Gamecentre, which gives live streaming and timeshift to watch games whenever you want. $50 for the season, though, and I didn't know when I'd actually have time to watch games, with a four year-old son, working 60 hours a week, etc.   
But then the Leafs were in the playoffs. Check the NHL site: gamecentre is only $20 for the entire playoffs. Sign up-cool, I'll avoid seeing the results during the day, come home and watch the games, skipping through commercials and stuff. Well, I did that for game one. Watching the CBC feed brought back all kinds of warm memories, and seeing how the Leafs played made me think that I hadn't missed anything. I could not watch a Leaf game for decades, and they'd still be the mistake-prone, wasteful team they've been since 1994. 

But then I had a day off for game two. My son and I got up and watched his first NHL game. And screamed and shook our apartment complex. It was an awesome, but bizarre, feeling. At that point I only knew the names of a handful of players, knew close to nothing of their careers up until that point, but I somehow felt devoted to them. I wanted so badly to fly back home for Game 3. Not to be at the ACC, but to be at Maple Leaf Square, or a bar, or really just in the city to feel the vibe. 

I started listening to TSN Radio during my packed train commutes and lunch breaks. I read all the players' bios. And I gave up on trying to watch the games after the fact. I scheduled meetings during game times (8-11ish am), shut myself in a conference room, and chewed my nails off. After game four I felt so bad for them; they had played so well, but I knew 3-1 was too much to ask for. 

After that, I've been on the same ride as everyone else, except that while it was easier for me to get away from it and focus on other things, there was nobody to talk to about it. Without being there, it somehow became just the Leafs and me. Whatever happened, I was going to be okay with it. I forced myself not to get too excited, but just couldn't believe it would end. Even going into OT, I thought somehow it would be okay. 

I think I'm going through the same dilemma as a lot of fans: I don't know whether to be proud of the comeback, or embarrassed/angry about the choke. What I can say for sure, though: I am a fan again. 

Next year I will be with them from the start, and they will do better than they did this year. And one day they will win it all.",,False,self,t5_2r8hf,False,,,True,t3_1ebbm2,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/1ebbm2/nobody_else_to_talk_to_have_to_vent_to_you_guys/,

1367536528.0,26,self.leafs,1dl13f,How to beat the Bruins!? Suggestions for lineup changes? Here's my take.,midnightstrike,33,7,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/1dl13f/how_to_beat_the_bruins_suggestions_for_lineup/,"Honestly I feel as if Carlyle needs to get this ""beat the Bruins with toughness"" out of his head: It ain't happening. Don't get bullied around, but there is no way in hell the Leafs are intimidating the Bruins in any way. Take notes from the Habs, those shitheads regularily score 4+ goals against them. How? Speed, speed, speed. Nice crisp exit passes, use your speed, to either carry it over the line, or dump and retrieve. As much as I love Orr, Mclaren and Fraser, two of them need to be benched (that would be you Mclaren and Fraser). Use gardiner's speed from the back end join the rush occasionally. My lines would be

* Lupul-bozak-kessel
* JVR-Kadri-Mac
* Komarov-Grabo-Kulemin (Shutdown line)
* Colborne/Hamilton-McClement-Orr

* Phaneuf-Gunnar
* Liles-O'Bryne
* Gardiner-Franson

Theres enough toughness in there Randy, the Leafs aren't going to take shit from the Bruins anymore, this is a mentally physical team now imo. We aren't going to beat the Bruins at their game, and we have to take advantage of the fact that we can out skate them while not being totally dominated physically. 

Also shoot the fucking puck! You are not going to win a game with 3 odd shots in a period! Possess the shit out of the puck, if you are on the ice for more than 1 minute in you own end you are doing something wrong (Kostka wtf man 2 shifts longer than 2 minutes in your own end??).

I understand a lot of this was playoff ""jitters"" or whatever you call it, but you cannot lose game 2. Losing it would mean game 3 is a must win, at home, for the first time in 9 years. You do not need that pressure.

And finally play with your hearts on your sleeves. Sacrifice your body! Not saying there wasn't effort there, but its the playoffs, effort needs to be ramped up even higher.

Yes, we get it, the Leafs haven't been successful for years, and believe it or not, we are most definitely aware that our team last won the Stanley Cup in 1967 (better than most teams can say anyway). 

Case in point: the current post about the mall Santa being fired. Yes, it is a funny story, but when every. single. comment is the same ""lolz but they do!"" it gets old real fast. It's honestly gotten to the point where I barely if ever go in the trash talk threads anymore. I know it's supposed to be a trash talk thread and not taken seriously, but at least put some thought into it instead of the same ""LOL LAFFS SUCK 67"" comments that are farted out by everyone (ironically including Columbus fans).

I left HfBoards because the childishness and anti-Leafs crap was unbearable, and /r/hockey is becoming the same thing.

#### Game Notes
* [NHL.com preview](http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2011020723)
* In last night's game, the Leafs with the least ice time was MacArthur
* Montoya is expected to start tonight for the Islanders
* 7 Islanders played more than 20 minutes compared to just 3 Leafs
* The Leafs' stats have passed some round-number milestones, some good and some bad: they now allow fewer than 3 goals per game on average; their PP is now below 20%; are their PK has reached 75%
* The Leafs have not allowed a goal while shorthanded in 10 games; that streak started after allowing power play goals in 6 straight games
* The Islanders have not allowed a goal while shorthanded in 6 games, and have only allowed one in their last 14 games ... they're also 3rd in the league in fewest times shorthanded
* Toronto is on a four-game road losing streak
* In games after being shut out, the Islanders are 4-1-2
* The first goal of the game dictates the outcome for the Islanders: when scoring first, they're 15-3-3; when trailing first, they're 4-19-3 (the Leafs are 16-8-1 and 8-11-4 in those situations respectively)
* Moulson leads the Islanders with +10; next is Tavares at +2",,False,self,t5_2r8hf,True,,16,True,t3_ov4hz,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/ov4hz/game_thread_leafs_at_islanders_january_24_700_tsn/,

#### Game Threads
Is there anything you'd like to see in game thread self-posts that isn't currently there? Note that I need to balance the utility of the included stats and info with how long it takes to pull together.  
[Here's the last game thread for reference.](http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/mv4tx/game_thread_leafs_vs_bruins_november_30_700pm_tsn/)

#### Redditquette
Please upvote comments that add to the discussion and downvote comments that don't. Don't vote based on allegiance (e.g. downvoting other teams' fans' comments) or on opinion (e.g. when you disagree with someone saying ""Luke Schenn had an awful game""). Reddit works best when a variety of viewpoints can be discussed.

#### Submitting your own Content
We're lucky to have a few authors and other content creators active on /r/leafs. However, remember that reddit works best when redditors participate actively in the community by commenting on and submitting articles from a wide variety of sources. You can submit your own content as long as you meet these guidelines, i.e. you:

* Submit only quality content that you think other redditors will find interesting
* Submit links from sites other than your own as well
* Comment on submissions other than your own 

#### URL Shorteners
Please don't use URL shorteners (e.g. bit.ly) in comments or submissions. They usually get caught in the spam filter.

#### Reminders
I've seen a couple of comments asking about these, so I thought these links would be helpful reminders. Both are on the sidebar for more permanent reference.

Matt Finn is 19 years old defenceman hailing from Etobicoke (a suburb of Toronto), Ontario, and was a huge Leafs fan growing up. Leading up to the 2010 OHL priority draft, Finn put up 22 goals and 67 points in 79 games for the AAA Toronto Marlboros in the GTHL and was selected 12th overall by the Guelph Storm. He has averaged over 0.75 points-per-game in his both of his two most recent OHL seasons, has been an on and off-ice leader since his rookie year, and is the Storm’s current captain. He won also won a gold medal for Canada at the 2011 U-17 World Hockey Challenge. The Leafs drafted “Finner” from the Guelph Storm in 2012 with the 35th overall pick, a second round selection.
Matt Finn’s post-draft season did not treat him too well, as an illness and injury forced him to only play 41 regular season games and miss all five playoff games. He first contracted a serious case of mono which forced him to sit out for six weeks, and then, after only five games back, was hit knee-on-knee by Sabres prospect Justin Kea (shown below), ending his season. He is also cousins with former Leaf Carlo Colaiacovo and childhood friends with the Leafs’ 2012 6th round choice and Eerie Otters captain, Connor Brown.

 | **OHL Totals** | 162 | 24 | 76 | 100 | 105 | -11 


**Offseason**

After recovering from his knee injury, Finn is now playing with the best players under the age of 20 that Canada has to offer at the World Junior exhibition games in Lake Placid. Other Leafs prospects joining him there are Morgan Reilly, Frederik Gauthier, and Ryan Rupert. He has been impressive on defence and has one goal so far. 

**Expectations**

Finn is not expected to play for the Leafs for a few years at least, which means he will most likely play another season with, and captain, the Guelph Storm. Let’s hope he stays injury/illness free this year and does not end up like his cousin Colaiacovo.

**Additional Comments**

Hopefully my formatting isn't terrible, I rarely post anything, especially with tables included. A roommate of mine went to high school with Finn and we have seen him play games in Guelph so let's hope he makes the Leafs, the team he grew up cheering for, in the not-to-distant future.

Why is a no-comment a story, especially from a guy who's done what, one post-game interview ever? 

I get why the media wants to talk to him, it's a storyline, albeit one that's been beaten to death, with the only difference being it's the playoffs this time. But it's the Toronto media, of course they're going to run the Kessel vs. Boston story. What I don't get is why they seem surprised enough that he didn't talk to them to all run stories about it.

[But more importantly, why are the Leafs not telling reporters to get the fuck off their star player's lawn and acting like his decision not to talk to the media is a problem now?](http://sports.nationalpost.com/2013/04/29/kessels-disappearing-act-starts-early/)

It seems like the team is really hanging him out to dry during what is probably a nightmare scenario for him, and not really the best way to handle a player you need to overcome his Boston demons right now.

EDIT - Big reason I ask is last season during the Leafs collapse I was watching a Leafs game online (one of those raw feeds, that doesn't cut to commercials, it just cuts to the camera guy testing out equipment, and occasionally the announcers would have some off air conversation) and it was right after Leafs blew another game. Joe Bowen was announcing it, and right after he did his ""Thank you and good night"", the raw feed cut to him leaning over his announcer box, both hands on the rail, and just shaking his head. Someone off mic says something to him, and he responds ""Yeah but at least you'll have a job in April"". Pretty sad seeing him so dejected, so it would be really cool to hear his reaction of the Leafs success.

-
- [Garret Sparks](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=130562) (7TH ROUND, 190TH OVERALL, 2011 - Guelph, OHL) Has gotten better each season since his draft year. Finished the year tied for the OHL lead in wins (36) and shutouts (7) after playing in a league leading 60 games. Sparks was also selected as part of the gold medal winning team USA at the world juniors but never played in a game. 

- [Mark Owuya](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=107130) (FREE AGENT SIGNING, 2011 - Toronto, AHL) After a strong AHL debut last season going 11-5-1 with a .929 sv% Owuya has regressed this year going 4-4-1 with an .883 sv% and hasn't started a game in over a month.

- [Jussi Rynnas](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=94172) (FREE AGENT SIGNING, 2010 - Toronto, AHL) The 6'5"" Fin who many had compared to Pekka Rhinne a few years ago has never quite found his groove in North America. He's been ok at best playing 20-30 games the last 3 years and posting a sv% around the .910 mark in each of them. He, like Owuya, has been supplanted by minor league vet [Drew MacIntyre](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=49899) who has played great for the Marlies the past month.

Defencemen
-
- [Morgan Rielly](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=130695) (1ST ROUND, 5TH OVERALL, 2012 - Moose Jaw, WHL/Toronto, AHL) Rielly had a strong start to his WHL season playing at a point-per-game pace leading up to his selection for Canada's 2013 world junior team. Reilly was solid, if unspectacular, posting 3 points in 6 games for the eventual 4th place team. He finished the year 5th in WHL defencemen scoring with 54 points in 60 games. He has played 3 games for the Marlies since Moose Jaw missed the playoffs posting 1 goal. 

- [Jesse Blacker](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=106794) (2ND ROUND, 58TH OVERALL, 2009 - Toronto, AHL) His second professional season has seen a statistical regression from last year with just 10 points in 53 games (down from 16 in 58 last season). As a two-way defenceman, Blacker has yet to really find his offensive game in the AHL but has been a solid, physical defender. He recently earned his first NHL call-up but will likely sit out for now as the 7th man.

- [Matt Finn](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=130587) (2ND ROUND, 35TH OVERALL, 2012 - Guelph, OHL) It's been an up and down season for the captain of the Guelph Storm as he missed 6 weeks with mononucleosis then suffered a knee sprain in his fifth game back and will be out for the start of the playoffs. Despite the missed games, Finn put up a solid 31 points in 41 games (a similar pace to last season) and will hope for a healthier year next season.

- [Stuart Percy](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=122896) (1ST ROUND, 25TH OVERALL, 2011 - Mississauga, OHL) Drafted as a leader and 2-way defender, Percy has augmented his offensive game to a much higher level since his draft year. After an injury plagued 2011-12 year, Percy has rebounded for a solid 45 point campaign, good for 11th in OHL defencemen scoring while captaining a weak Mississauga team. 

Other top defensive prospects include:

- [Juraj Mikus](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=105421)

#### Game Notes
* [NHL.com preview](http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2011020771)
* While the Senators are ahead of the Leafs in the standings by 3 points, the Leafs have played 3 fewer games and actually have a better point percentage
* Ottawa has won the last three matchups this season, but has lost its last five overall
* Anderson is starting his 17th straight game and has played in 49 games this season to lead all goalies ... Ottawa is 28th in goals against/game
* 5 of the Leafs' 15 fights this season have come against the Senators ... 3 of those involved Konopka, who leads the league with 16 fights
* Four Senators (including Konopka) have more penalty minutes than the 56 that Leaf leader Phaneuf has
* Kessel and Lupul are both pointless in their last three games
* Ottawa is 27th in the league in first period goals for, but tied for first in third period scoring",,False,self,t5_2r8hf,False,,16,True,t3_paywu,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/paywu/game_thread_leafs_at_senators_february_4_700_cbc/,

#### Game Notes
* [NHL.com preview](http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2011020482)
* [As expected](http://redd.it/nidid), Connolly will centre the top line between Kessel and Lupul, the MacArthur-Grabovski-Kulemin line is reunited, and Bozak drops to the third line
* The Kings' last game was an 8-2 loss to Detroit ... despite the score, three players (Penner, Williams, and Stoll) were +2 in the game
* Kings interim coach Stevens is 1-2-0 ... this will likely be his last game as Darryl Sutter prepares to take over
* LA is last in the league in goals per game (Leafs are 7th) but are 15th in shots per game (Leafs are 22nd)
* The Kings have just 12 first period goals this season, by far the fewest in the league (Leafs have 27)
* Los Angeles hasn't scored more than two goals in any of their past 11 games
* Toronto is 2-0-1 vs. the Pacific Division this year ... LA is 0-3-0 vs. Northeast Division teams
* Without Mike Richards in the lineup, no qualifying players on the Kings are shooting better than 11% ... the Leafs have seven players with a shooting percentage of 14% or better
* Both teams are predominantly North American, with just three European skaters each
* Quick is tied for tops in the league with four shutouts ... the Leafs have just one shutout this season

* [Tonight's the induction ceremony](http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=567572&amp;amp;navid=DL|TOR|home) for new Hall-of-Famers Doug Gilmour, Ed Belfour, Joe Nieuwendyk, and Mark Howe  ... look for puck drop to be ~7:25
* Steckel leads the league (by far) in home faceoff proficiency at 68.4% ... he takes 30% of the Leafs' faceoffs overall
* Senators defenceman Karlsson is last in the league in shooting % (min. 1 shot/game) with just 1 goal on 60 shots
* Konopka and Neil are ranked 1 and 2 in the league in penalty minutes ... not coincidentally, Konopka is tied for the most fights with 6
* The Senators are one of just four teams that allow more goals per game than the Leafs
* Ottawa is on game 2 of a 6-game road trip that will take them through four Canadian cities

#### Game Notes
* [NHL.com preview](http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2011021069)
* Carlyle will decide at game time whether to dress Franson or Rosehill
* Reimer gets the start; he's 3-0 in his career at Scotiabank Place
* Bishop is expected to get his sixth straight start for the Sens
* Ottawa has allowed more goals than any other team in a playoff position
* Karlsson leads all NHL defencemen with 71 points, which is 24 more than the next highest scorer ... Phaneuf leads the Leafs' D with 40 points
* Phaneuf and Karlsson are 9th and 10th in the league in average ice time
* Spezza is averaging over a point a game for the first time since 2007-08
* Despite leading the Northeast Divison, the Sens are just 9-9-3 against division rivals ... they're 21-7-5 against the rest of the East
* Ottawa is a third-period team: they've scored the most third period goals and are tied for third with 7 wins when trailing after two periods",,False,self,t5_2r8hf,False,,16,True,t3_r18jl,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/r18jl/game_thread_leafs_at_senators_march_17_700_cbc/,

Burke says he builds his teams from the net out. We are 26th or worse in GA/game. Three and a half years into the rebuild, you'd think we would at minimum have a solid goaltending tandem and some defensive awareness.  
Burke is on record as saying his teams play run-and-gun because it's entertaining and he's in competition for the fans' entertainment dollar.  But he doesn't have the goalie to play run-and-gun and none of his defence are good enough for that style either. Respectfully, Mr. Burke, do you know what's REALLY entertaining? Winning hockey games.  
I don't understand how Burke--a player's GM if there ever was one--can be best friends with a coach who seems to hate most of his players. I don't understand how Wilson still has a job.

#### Game Notes
* [Full preview from NHL.com](http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2011020002)  
* Toronto finished the preseason 4-4-0 while Montreal finished 2-6-0
* The Leafs will be wearing their new third jerseys for the first time ... they were 11-15-6 in those jerseys against the Habs from 1967 to 1970  
* Newly acquired David Steckel will likely centre Colby Armstrong and Philippe Dupuis on the third line
* Players making their Leafs regular season debut include Steckel, Dupuis, Lombardi, Liles, Franson, and Gardiner",,False,self,t5_2r8hf,True,,16,True,t3_l2wje,http://www.reddit.com/r/leafs/comments/l2wje/game_thread_leafs_vs_canadiens/,moderator

My opinion is that JVR is not a good play maker and that's why Kessel is struggling. Their goals are usually solo efforts and there's no real chemistry between the two. JVR would be a better bet on the checking line and Lupul 100% has to play on the first line with Kessel, there's no doubt in my mind.

Been a pleasure watching this sub the past year or so, and being a member for longer. This is definitely one of the most passionate collection of subs around, and one of the top subs among NHL hockey team subs on reddit! Great work! 

We love the great discussion, we love the new and original content, but a quick reminder of some things that we don't approve of here:

* Hateful speech, discriminatory comments, racist, homophobic, sexist remarks.  - We will remove all comments and posts like this. If you see anything like this, please **report** them to the mods and we'll address.

* BlogSPAM. - A lot of you write pieces on the team you love. That's very admirable and it's what any fan who loves and follows the team should do. However, this subreddit is not free promotion for your blog, and if you're posting content that isn't sourced, original (facilitates discussion) or simply just a link to your blog, it will be removed. Again, it's really easy to track the links to blogs by user account and by post frequency. 

* Ticket re-selling. This is a difficult topic to address, because this team is very inaccessible live and getting a pair of tickets can be quite tricky. Still, for the time being, we're not going to allow classified-style posts on tickets for sale. If you have tickets for sale, please use the for-sale subreddit, kijiji, craigslist, ebay or whatever to sell your tickets. Or heck, direct message another user if you want to buy or sell and they've indicated a need for either.

The rest of the submission guidelines can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/leafs

Please help yourselves!

Now, since we're slated to start hockey in the next 2 weeks, one last reminder:
