This will be no easy task, but you shall be greater because of it. 

I'm challenging you to BE John Marston.

Boot up a new game. Turn the music off, so the only sounds you'll hear is the wilderness bearing upon you and the occasional bouts of gunfire. Turn off the subtitles. You're going to have to use those ears of yours.  And finally, (and this will create the most challenging environment) turn off the waypoint and mini map. To become John Marston, you'll have to rely on your sense of direction (and maybe the occasional glance at your map) and your eyesight to spot plants in the wilderness.

My parents are very *""meh""* towards gaming in general despite my attempts to get them to play some of the latest releases.  
   
  
Sat down and loaded the game up. Dad walks in during the intro and asks what I am doing. *""New Game""*, I say in passing as he takes a seat. Normally he would sit for 5 minutes, get bored, and then either kick me out or head to the back room TV. But he is really into westerns and I could see him getting interested.  
   
  
Watch the whole opening sequence, getting shot by some moron in a fort and then getting picked up by bonnie and taken back to the farm. Don't bother with the missions, want to free roam a bit. Wander up to a horse and hop on (WANTED) pops up ... the fuck?! Suddenly I am being chased down by the law and I have no idea what I am doing, spam X and my horse bucks me off. Dad laughing at me but I could tell he was enjoying himself. Posse arrests me and takes me to jail. I am super impressed with the visuals, and the passage of time while sitting in the cell.  
   
  
Get released -&gt; don't have enough money to pay off fines so have to go kill some guy. Ride out into the desert and track down my target, furious shoot out occurs. Shoot weapons out of guys hands and shoot them in the legs so they can't run away, just generally having fun. The animations on character hit are incredible, the way the enemies die and react to hit locations. This was the moment I really felt myself getting hooked. Kill the target and search him, cool.  
   
  
Heading back to town and a guy calls out from the side of the road. Dad demands I stop to see what he wants. His wagon crashed and 2 convicts escaped, he needs them captured or killed. Don't know how to capture so kill it is. Ride them down. So much fun ... shooting them as I ride over them. Dude pays me. Money! Horay. Hand my bounty in at town and get more cash. Head to saloon, have a few shots and wander into poker room. Bust out in about 4 hands, and then shoot up everyone in the room. Everyone runs from the saloon and the Law surrounds it, another awesome shootout occurs. Get shot and killed ....  
   
  
Dad laughs at me and then realises he has been watching me play a game for a about 2 hours. Asks me how to setup the PS3 so he can *""maybe""* have a go later ... . Show him how. Feels good =D.  
   
  
Thankyou Rockstar.

Edit: After reading the comments below it seems that people dislike Jack for 3 primary reasons.

1. He isn't John and you played the game as John - This is a fair enough argument but shouldn't lead to people really disliking him

2. He is whiny/spoilt - I would like you to consider what type of father John is when you think this. From everything I heard in the game John is a terrible father, sure at the end he is trying to be a good father but what does a couple days or weeks amount to 16 years. Think about how despite Johns like of hunting he hasn't ever taken Jack out despite years of Jack being old enough, he was constantly running with Dutch's gang when Jack was a kid and to Jack his father leaving again would have felt like yet another abandonment and it isn't as if he was ever actually told what happened seeing as he how has to ask and they never actually answered the questions. So in summary maybe you should be blaming John for being a bad father for 16 years instead of Jack.

So many ways to play it, so many things to do, endless entertainment, and the scenery *never* gets boring. Each sunrise is breath taking, each gaze over a canyon and river just makes me stop and stare at it for a few minutes. I'm just past the part in the game where some bandit's burn Bonnie's barn, and I have so much to learn and I haven't figured much out.

One thing I'd like to see though is a food and water mod. I would so much like to have to get water and food to survive, and sleep. Maybe I'm playing on easy mode, but I wish there were an option to put in hardcore and have to hunt and eat or you starve, and also gather water to drink so I don't dehydrate. 

Would anybody else like this? It would sort of be like DayZ.

**TL:DR, I wish there was a food/water meter so I had to hunt/cook food and gather/drink water.**

edit: if you guys don't mind, I'd like to ask a few questions too. What is Dead Eye and how does it work? After I lasso, and then tame/break a new horse, how can I make it mine so I don't have to ride my old one? How do I travel across the rivers? All the bridges are down and water apparently kills you.

-You can jump off a building onto your horse.

-Dead bodies appear as an X on your minimap.

-If you crouch by a hogtied victim, lock on, and attack with your knife, you will slit their throat.

-Lasso something and while holding LT press RT to yank toward you.

-Pushing X when your horse isn't moving makes it rear up.

-There's no bandana animation if you're on your horse or your weapon is drawn.

-You can shoot certain windows. Also, if you go into cover by them and aim they break. Most of these windows can be vaulted through them by pressing X.

-Poker players have tells.

-Trains stop if you kill the engineer.

-Camera gets rain, dirt, and blood on it.

-You can put a waypoint on your map, setup camp, and fast travel.

-Pushing Y while in cover by a closed door opens it.

♦Drinking around ten drinks (two dollars each) will get you drunk. Bumping into people while drunk is a almost certain way to get challenged to a duel. 

♦Tired of Poker? Early on (supposedly) the only other place to try other card/dice games is Thieves Landing. Thieves Landing boasts Blackjack and Liars dice. 

♦Throwing knives *can* be used in Dead Eye. 

♦Short on the money? Liars dice is a great way to make money. At Thieves landing (if you win) you get $20 for each person eliminated for a fairly easy game. 

♦Trouble locating a tailor for an outfit? Open up the outfit menu and press X (for the Xbox, I don't know the corresponding button on the PS3) to ""Track"". Example: ""Buy from tailor in thieves landing"" will place a marker on thieves landing. 

♦You can swap weapons in the same category by pressing Left or Right on the D-Pad while highlighting the weapon with the weapon wheel. 

♦While being bad is fun, its not smart early on. Having few guns, low ammo, hardly any cash and having a $6,000 bounty with every lawman trying to gun you down does not make it easy. 

♦The Lasso is badass. Throwing it at people is fun. But even merely aiming it at someone, let alone tossing it, is slightly criminal and warrants a bounty. (Aiming goes towards robbery, tying up is assault or something along the lines of that) 

♦You DONT need to buy guns. Seriously. You can, I know I do, but you dont need to. Dead eye alone makes even the weakest guns powerful. Knowing this saves you A LOT of money. 

♦Out of ammo? The lasso is a great way to get some easy ammo. Toss it around someone and walk backwards, pulling them towards you. You can then let go of the lasso, and stab them on their way up, killing them and getting their ammo from their body.

♦Looking for a stealthy way to kill? Target someone with a knife and come up behind. Attack and you will perform a throat slit.

♦You can only get the ""Dastardly"" achievement if the train is going at full speed. Putting the woman in front of a stopped train and waiting for it to move will not net you the gamerscore.

I swear it was an accident. He broke my fall and I broke his back. Poor Harold.

After Harold came Terrance. Terrance was blonde, beautiful, and blazingly fast, a mighty steed that had accompanied me on many missions and hunting trips. It was my personal desire to keep him throughout the game in order to unlock the achievement. Plus he was fast and didn’t mind too much when I accidentally shot him in the ass a few times while chasing wolves. All around a good horse.
I was in Pike’s Basin last night killing and looting, when I decided to hoof it on foot for awhile to grab all the money and ammo scattered across the valley floor.  With my pockets bulging I whistled for Terrance and noticed the handy blue horse head dot appear on the map. I looked behind me and didn’t see him, even though he was maybe a few hundred yards back. Then I looked up and spotted him. Perched high on the edge of the cliff overlooking the valley he whinnied at me. I smiled to myself and thought there’s my fine mount! My smile turned to horror as I saw him make a move towards the edge of the cliff. “Terrance no! Don’t do it!”. A truly loyal friend, Terrance burst from the cliff soaring through the air like a cow without wings and came crashing to the valley floor in a crumpled heap of horse. I ran over to him and cursed his stupidity, but didn’t have the stomach to skin him.

After awhile I acquired my third horse, Sir Hoofington the 3rd. He was a nice milk chocolate horse not as fast as Terrance, but fast enough to keep up with a train. I found this out when I saw a train and thought “I wonder if you can jump onto the train from the horse”. I had tried this once before with bad results. I caught up to the steam engine and after finally getting my speed and distance just right with the train I noticed the ‘x’ button appear with the caption ‘jump to train’. SWEET! Right as my thumb moved over to press ‘x’ a fucking cougar comes out of nowhere and chomps Sir Hoofington in the rear, killing him and throwing me on the ground. Damn cougars! The train and the cougar both got away and I stood on the train tracks alone. Awesome.

Now I’m onto my fourth horse, Moonshine. He’s dark in color with a huge white ass that looks like he’s always mooning you. I don’t know if he’s any good yet, but with an ass like that he’s probably slow and stupid.

Hey, I think it's pretty well accepted that Red Dead Redemption has a very well crafted story, as well as well developed characters. One of the better examples of story in a video game (particularly the ending). But I don't often see much discussion of the story beyond people saying it was great, or emotional, or surprising. 

So I thought I'd start a discussion here. What do people think of the story, the characters, the setting? What are your thoughts on the themes and motifs? What do you think are the themes and motifs?

It's been a year or so since I've played it, but I remember the most distinct theme as how **although you can become a better person and do good deeds, the good doesn't erase the bad, and you can't be redeemed or magically absolved of your past sins**. Essentially that redemption is impossible-although, you can certainly become a better person and do good acts that might even *outweigh* the bad acts, they don't just magically erase them.

That's built up through the whole game, and culminates in the ending which displays it brilliantly. John seems to have ""redeemed"" himself by killing the gang, like the government wanted, but they killed him anyway because they still considered him dangerous. He was still one of the gang. Although he did everything he wanted, he couldn't erase his past as well. It's even more tragic when Jack, although he had the chance to be a good person entirely, became a bitter and jaded man, eventually an outlaw and a killer himself.


I think those long horseback conversations developed a lot of the themes of the game. I know the Mexico arc revolved around one, but I can't understand it as well as the no redemption theme. Maybe how power is inherently corrupt? The futility of war, of rebellion? Not sure.

( no spoilers) ",mikedog87,26,10,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/16iet2/just_started_playing_my_second_time_around_this/,"Hy guys,

Well my Xbox got hacked when I was at 97% on rdr. Ended up selling my Xbox. Long story short just bought one solely for this game.

For some reason thought my saves would be attached to my GT. but no.

Just hit Mexico on my second time through and found this sub.

Thought I would post some tips for the newbs out there, feel free to add things.


1. You get the lasso after a couple missions with Bonnie. 

2. Buy the bandana when u get to thieve landing. Helps to put it on when you wanna mess shit up and not lose honor or fame.

3. The horse Bonnie gives you is one of the fastest in the game. There are 3 in singleplayer. ( not including war horse) try not lose it. If you do don't waste $1500 on it. Either go catch one at warthington ranch or wait till it's 750 when your honor is much higher.

4. Use dead eye. It's awesome. Press r3 to activate and just head shot alot :) 

5. When u kill anything (animal or person) If there is skinning or loot it will show up as an X on your map.

6. For people doing the challenge. You can kill things with a knife while your riding :)

7. If you stop your horse right on too of the dead animal and get off. Keep tapping to skin as your getting off the horse. It will skip the skinning cutscenes and saves alot of time. ( helping when there are cougars aroun)

8.  Don't play undead nightmare till you have finished the story line, trust me.

9. Don't kill alot of people early on. Wait till you get the bandana. A $1000 bounty seems fun to get but hard to play when you are constantly being targeted by every bounty hunter in the region.

10. I kill almost every animal I see and it takes just seconds to quickly skin it when you do the trick I mentioned earlier. I have never had a problem with money and always have $500+ 

11. Don't buy guns or ammo. You always pick up enough. Even if u want that buffalo rifle. Keep playing eventually someone will drop one. And always free ammo in your safe house in the chest. Just keep saving and it respawns.

12. I only just learnt this after failing a race 5 times with a shit horse. ( apples regen your horses stamina) use them. 

13. Tabacco and whiskey regen your dead eye. Use them. 

14. You get the tomahawk in manzatina general store. If you have the legends and killers DLC.

15. Careful when you see strangers, some will aid you, others will ask for a ride and steal your horse. (Courtesy of themightymatador)

All I got for now, thought this answers some common questions I have seen. If you have anymore ask away and I wil reply when I can. If you already know all this, good. Up vote so others can see. If you have anything you want me to add just reply.

1274880974.0,18,self.reddeadredemption,c8a82,Tips for playing Liars dice like a pro. ,,20,2,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/c8a82/tips_for_playing_liars_dice_like_a_pro/,"Liars dice is a tricky game and I have noticed many RedDedditors have had troubles with it, being a self-proclaimed Liars Dice champ (I did get the ""No Dice"" Achievement.) I want to share some advice. 

The first and biggest tip I can share with you is do not, I repeat, DO NOT bet as low as you safely can. It may seem to be common sense to do this but its the worst thing you can possibly do. If you bid as low as you can, then so can they. If you bid high, go right out of the gate saying ""Three four's"" then they have to go four and five which makes it incredibly risky and almost certainly they will be wrong. 

Second, if you followed the first bit of advice and somehow it does come back to you and you have to make an incredibly risky bid,that most likely isn't true. don't.These AI will call you out. You have two options at this point. Calling the last bid as a bluff or calling it ""Spot-on"". Calling it spot on is the riskiest thing you can do in Liars Dice (but its better than accepting your fate at the hands of a completely bullshit bid). But if you succesfully do it (I have done it twice) its incredibly rewarding. Declaring a bid spot-on means that it is on the dot accurate. If someone say's ""Four three's"" and I declare it spot on, it has to be exactly four three's. If I am right and it is spot on, everyone except me loses a die. But if I am wrong, then I am the only one to lose a die. 

Third, some say its possible to use the disadvantages of the AI to your own advantage. The AI will (almost always) call out a bid of dice that they dont have. If I say ""two one's"". If they don't have any ones, even though its as low as two, they will call it out. Using this logic its possible to ""trick"" AI with a few dice to call out a legit bid. 

Fourth, Bidding is about speed. You have to be quick on the call. You do not want them to get the first bid, because if they do, it means you have to make the riskier bid. 

Fifth, Don't play with just one person. Play with two. When you see one person you think ""Oh, its just one guy, that means there's one less person to beat"" but that's exactly what makes it tougher. There is one less person. Five less dice on the field. The more dice, the easier it is. When its just two its highly possible to get caught in the hole were you have to make a risky bid, but with two other people this rarely happens as they tend to call out each other very frequently. You can safely watch as they wittle each other down, then you come up and (metaphorically) curb stomp them.

Red Dead Redemption has always been one of my favorite games both in terms of single player and multiplayer. But it's heart lies with it's community.
As a member of the Rockstar forums, A year ago I created a Red Dead version of the typical Infection game with it's own set of rules and submitted that to the forums. There was quite a big interest, but before we could arrange our first game unfortunately the forums were taken down to be tweaked. Hence we missed our chance to get the game started.

We're a year later now and after finding out some friends I made from other games were also into RDR, I decided to check the forums again and submit the same game mode once more. So far we've got 8 people for Xbox and nobody for PS3.
I thought Reddit might be a good spot to leave the link to the forums, aside from game modes there's tons of other stuff related to Red Dead. Events, competitions or just shenanigans, it can be found there.

Either way, thank you for reading and hopefully see you soon!

I loaded up RDR last night knowing I'd only really have the chance to play an hour at most. Knowing that, I did as little as possible. The introduction scenes take you across some of the most beautiful vistas in the game. Should I have tagged that a spoiler? I don't think it's a spoiler, I think it's just another reason this game is awesome. The world really feels huge. When you can look out over a vast plain and know that yes, you can go over there and it's not just a backdrop it's a really awesome feeling. 

People will disagree (it's what they do, right?) but in my opinion the entire world feels very alive. The same encounters do happen, but they're still varied enough that it feels right. There wouldn't be just one dick trying to steal your horse in the old west, right? 

The random events are great. I've heard the suicide talked about a few times now, and I came upon it today. Even after reading about it, I still sat there on my horse and just watched, unsure of what to do. Could I save him? What if I pulled out my rope and tried to tie him up? What if I went into dead eye and tried to shoot the gun out of his hand? It was too late. I watched as a man blew his brains out and fell dead across what I can only assume was his lover. I'll never really know. 

I know I'm not very far in, and I know that after I play a few more hours I'll probably have more praise to heap on this game. It's not without it's flaws, I've had texture pop in issues a bunch of times, mostly the terrain texture fails to switch from low to high resolution instantly sometimes, but it's an amazing game, everyone should check it out.

EDITS: Already! I got in a fight with the night watch dog at one point. I tried to tie it up and it started to bite me. I beat it for a little bit and it wimpered and ran off. I went to go about my business and a minute or two later the dog came back and started biting my ass. I shot the dog and skinned it. The fine I had to pay for killing the dog was about equal to what I got for selling the dogs parts. 

I came upon some guys assaulting a lone man, and I shot all but one of them. I tied him up and tossed him on the back of my horse. For the better part of an hour I rode around unsure of what to do with this criminal. I wanted to look for somewhere to turn him in, but I couldn't find anyone. I eventually left him tied up in the desert. I have not gone back to check on him, but I'm really hoping to find his corpse or half eaten body there later. 

EDITS2: I killed the doctor. I was in Armadillo minding my own business, waiting for the shops to open. I heard screams. I was concerned, and as I followed the sound a woman shouted for help. She was being kidnapped. I ran toward the sounds as fast as I could, and came upon a man running with a tied up woman over his shoulder. I shot him in the leg, and he dropped the woman. I hog tied him and stuck him on the back of the horse and cut the woman free. I couldn't decide what to do with the kidnapper. I took him out into the desert and shot him once between the eyes. The back of his head ended up on a nearby rock. The doctors office hasn't opened in three days now.

In terms of the last mission to kill Edgar Ross and avenge the death of your father, I cannot bring myself to put an end to his wife, but I will freely kill his brother each and every time.

I fully recognize that Phillip Ross is innocent of any crime.  That said, I also know that he would likely swear revenge upon me for what I am preparing to do to his brother.  Leaving Phillip Ross alive, while preferable from a karma standpoint, just seems like a bad idea.

I realize John would look unfavorably upon this act, but it's something that -- given the circumstances -- I feel has to be done.  I did it humanely.  One bullet in the chest, and another in the head.  I do not believe Jack has become a monster, having grown up with a much sounder sense of morality than his father and mother, so I do not roleplay him as one.

I loved the way it roped you in with the prologue and those first few missions involving Bonnie. 

By the end, I was thoroughly invested in John's odyssey.

I think a shortcoming in some RPGs is giving a complete blank of a protagonist for the player to fill. In this game, John was a character. I filled his shoes for a while. And even though I could still decide how he acted on a whole, he still had a defined persona. It arguably made for a more immersing experience. It made things matter in the context of the story. And the past played such an important role in it.

There was something so appealing about a man simply (if sometimes gruffly) trying to get his family back only to get caught up in a succession of other people's preoccupations. From rescuing a ranch owner's daughter, to getting involved in local politics and lawlessness, to winning a revolution, to ending an insurgency of outlaws against a dying time of the wild west, and completing a long string of side missions -- all with an undercurrent of unsettled scores -- it seemed John would never see Abigail and Jack again.

Then, he does. Which was so perfectly captured [in his ride back home](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ9iflvCwok).

And throughout all this, the landscape and setting were so captivating. Everything dynamic and static came together so perfectly.

The missions you do with Abigail, Jack, and Uncle, I genuinely thought, made for a wonderful epilogue to the game. The bonding, the characterization, it all added to the experience, and I was enjoying the supposed denouement. But how wrong I was.

Before the final series of missions, I had made sure to complete all challenges, acquire all uniforms (almost), and finish all the stranger side missions. I like to explore and do everything along the way. Even despite the urgency of the main plot, I never felt like I was rushed or lazy. It felt natural. Even when I stopped seemingly every couple miles to rescue someone from a plight, it felt like it fit with the milieu and added to John's character. Despite his objections, he would always help, at least in my play-through thus far (which lead to interesting consequences down the line).

So at the end when he got a visit from 'old friends,' I got confused, thinking it was some old gang connections that had come back for him, hearing about Dutch's death. When I saw I was shooting soldiers, I felt a growing dread. I was mad John had been betrayed, but it was never a sense of vulnerability. I had spent the game being invincible. This was no time to second guess John.

Then he walks out of the barn to the firing squad. That scene was perfect. Not seeing just how many soldiers there are right until the last second, the futility of the Dead Eye and the lack of choice in how it went down made for such a pressurized moment. The compromise between interaction and story was amazing throughout the game (and it culminated in this instance). And then that was it. John was on the ground. It was over.

I came back around as Jack. There was still the last scrap of the army uniform to buy from the Blacksmith tailor. I headed over there and saw a little question mark. Wondering how I'd missed a side mission, I started playing it. Pretty soon, I was recounting John's steps across the landscape. I was about to find John's murderer.

Then, the shootout between Jack and Edgar Ross was such a great finale. Like all prior duels, I developed a feeling of mercy. Surely, this man didn't deserve to die. He was rotten but he only did what he believed was right. He was cold but he wasn't necessarily evil. The game had done such a wonderful job of setting up the inanity of violence and shades of grey in the world; it seemed I had come all this way through the characters' journey and discovered that bloodshed would only spur more bloodshed.

I got shot and died.

I sat there, feeling disappointed, as the last save loaded. I tried again. This time, I quickly realized that disarming would not work, and aimed for a lethal shot. Edgar sank like a rock in the river.

That was when I realized, what I had experienced had been John's journey. But John was dead. And this was his son. He had none of the experience, nor the guidance, to know what I knew of their world. And Edgar was not a man to be reasoned with. I had expected a schmaltzy, enlightened ending but it would have robbed me of the better one that the game provided.

As I got the achievement ""Nature or Nurture"" I laughed, because right before I had blown Edgar's skull off, I had stopped an execution by some bandits on the side of the road. And in the end, shortly after, I hit 100% completion. But nothing could prepare me for the sense of purposelessness in Jack when there was nothing left to do in a vast, changing landscape after revenge had been claimed.",,False,self,t5_2rn7o,False,,,True,t3_1gi81s,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1gi81s/some_thoughts_or_a_summary_with_reflection_long/,

I've played before and absolutely love Red Dead, and now that I'm slowly working my way somewhere in my videos. I'm always looking to improve how I should go about them.

Instead of just going about and doing the storyline in Red Dead, can you guys offer any advice what you'd like to see in a solo lets play for this game? Anything that could go about giving it a more of a spark too.

It was made by Rockstar San Diego, How fucking difficult can it be to find Mexicans in the US? Even easier in California!

There's words being completely mispronounced, ""dirt poor"" peasants who have a higher level of speech than most educated people I know, and that breaks it completely. Would it be too much to ask to hire someone to translate the dialogue to how normal people talk while still retaining the same message? This is reflected on things like some guy dueling with you or being carried for bounty, and in an incredible display of hatred, he calls you ""baboso"". That's what a god damn 6 year old says as an insult.

Other than that, the game would've been perfect. I guess I won't be going to Mexico too much just because of this. It's too sad because the voice acting for the Americans was pretty good.

A couple of weeks ago me and my friend Darren came online for the first time in months. The free roam was so fresh and we were in a near full lobby. I recently had a heated debate with another friend of mine, Dylan, about the fact that he was getting paid by his own Dad to cut his garden, I thought this was a disgrace but he just kept replying ' You mad bro?'. Anyways after clearing out a few gang hideouts, I notice he come's online. Still a bit angry over the arguement, I don't invite him to the party. But i notice he's is playing Red Dead, something that he rarely does, (He's a COD fan). As I thought, he quickly joined our lobby and starting riding in our direction. 

As I was just about to invite him to the posse, something popped into my mind. I will make him pay for taking his fathers money. Me and Darren quickly stocked up on ammunition and equipped our Double-action Revolvers. Night was falling over Hennigan's Stead. Dylan was quickly approaching, even though he was only a level 3 on a donkey. Me and Darren, me being Marshal Johnson with an American Standerdbred, and Darren being John Marston with a Hungarian Half-bred. We stopped in thee middle of the road that Dylan was taking. Dylan came into sight, his character, an ugly, fat Mexican Rebel on a smoky grey donkey. Dylan began to slow down until he came to a stop about 15 metres away from us. He dismounted his stead and stood staring at us, as if he was asking to be accepted into our posse. A mintues passed that seemed like an hour, he was still staring but we stared right back. Finally, he began a slow jog towards us, as if he was  allowed into the gang. He wasn't. Me and Darren simultaneously drew our revolvers and riddled him with lead. He dash boarded.

This time, however, was different. The first time, I finished him off rather quickly with a shotgun; the second time, I opted for throwing knives; and this time, I figured I'd show some cajones &amp; use just my knife.

When Lobo had his first go at me, I slashed him a good few times. He ran and came back, and for his second go at me, I slashed him a few more times. Then something unexpected happened: He started limping away and whimpering like a beat up, scared dog. ""Oh no you don't,"" I said aloud ""I know you've got more fight in ya."" So I ran around to the front of him to confront him head on. Nothing. He was utterly defeated, and just kept limping past me, likely in the hopes that I'd leave him be.

But something in me wasn't clicking right. I waited a few moments. Any sane person would feel sad and stop. I felt sad and I wanted to stop--Maybe leave and come back when he had his strength back up, but RDR is a game and games have goals. My desire to complete a task overcome my need to be humane and I slashed him again, killing him when he was little more than a helpless heap of defeat.

I know it's just a game, but GOD! what kind of game allows for that scenario? It's almost as bad as the Skyrim mod for killing children, something would never consider even watching a video of. Games have always tried to fulfill fantasies and the desire to do things we can't otherwise do via virtual reality, but that presupposes that something we can't do, we WANT to do. I've never once wanted to kill a wolf, let alone any other animal. Fantasy animals that are always within the sphere of evil, yes, but normal animals, no. Everyone has a fantasy to experience the wild west and in a great capacity, RDR fulfills that. As far as this scenario goes, though, I don't know whose fantasy has been fulfilled, but it's definitely not mine. The old westerns were about heroes, and while John Marston is a hero to a degree, RDR can be downright cynical at times.",,False,self,t5_2rn7o,1340679530.0,,,True,t3_vlxou,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/vlxou/r_ive_done_something_despicable_and_its_left_a/,

I ride up next to the train and jump on, then make my way to the passenger car.

In the midst of fiddling around trying to get it to work, I accidentally pistol-whip the guy I’m aiming at, and he collapses. The other passengers freak out and try to exit the train car. As one of them runs past, I try to rob her, but she’s become a witness to my pistol-whipping, and so my Y button has changed to the Bribe action. So she runs past and I stuff a bunch of money into her pocket. By the time I understand what’s happened, the train has stopped and everyone has evacuated. I slink off in embarrassment.

When I became Jack the first thing I did was ride into black water to have a game of high stakes poker to celebrate what I thought was the end game but as I rode in I saw a ? and decided what the hell.

I then realise, after speaking to the agent that this was going to be Jacks revenge mission.

  So I ride out to the farm I was directed to, it was storming and as I rode up to the little house by the lake I see and old woman sitting. I ask her about Edgar Ross's location and am informed that he is out hunting. I tip my hat and call my horse, I stop, then pullout my high powered pistol, the one given to my father by Agent Ross. This isn’t the books I read as a child, this is cold, I am now my father as he used to be. I point it at Edger's wife and pull the trigger, the little old lady slumps in her chair the back of her head blown out onto the side panelling of the little white house. I burn the house down as thunder rolls in the distance.

  I ride fast, the rain beating the ground around me, I don’t look back. As I cross the bridge into Mexico doubt makes me waver, what am I doing? Am I really going to do this? I see a camp fire in the distance but the man standing beside it is not Ross. I get off my horse as I get close and tell him I have a message for Ross. The man, Ross's brother, tells me he is down the river a way, hunting duck. Anger broods in me, not one more living thing will die by Edger’s hand. Without thinking I pull my pistol, time slows; I unload a full clip into Ross's brother’s body before he even touches the hilt of his gun. Blood pools around his limp corpse, the rain dilutes it. Lightning cracks near by and I see my refection in the blood, I see my fathers face.

  Its not far to my final destination, there he is and old man shooting ducks in the rain. I confront him, he lies about my father’s honour, I let him draw first. He falls, I don’t remember pulling the trigger, the gun is smoking in my hand. I turn and walk away, I don’t know how my father would feel about what I just did, then I realise I don’t care.

So anyways, Today I was playing Red Dead and was making a stop at the MacFarlane ranch for a quick game of poker, on my way out on the bridge near Bonnie's house I see a NPC named Clinton Ledbetter wanting a duel. Rather than duel him I push him off the bridge, causing him to fall several feet and hurt himself. In drunken rage he pulls out a gun and starts shooting. Immediately after I notice the symbols for law enforcement on my radar, but I don't see the red circle, nor does it say I'm wanted. Puzzled I wait to see what the law enforcement has to say. They run right past me and start shooting someone off screen. I turn around just in time to see Clinton Ledbetter getting torn apart by the Sheriff's Revolver. After Clinton is killed, the symbols disappear off my map. 

TL;DR NPC's can get a wanted rating and will be attacked by law enforcement.

I stopped playing FR because people would just mauser-spawn me, and started playing shootout and bag games because of the golden guns and i have a few questions.

1-How much time it takes to be good at this game? The games just feel unbalanced, because it was released some time ago and it's like ""pros, pros everywhere"". Some times i end up giving up and go spawn mauser or shotgun at them. 

2-I'm not a fucktard, i don't try to shoot people at the torso, but i most of the time i simply don't headshot. I aim at their head, and there's no headshot. most of the time it happens with repeaters/rifles at mid/far range. Is this a bug?

3-Leading to a similar question, should i have waited until i am actually good at the game to get the golden guns, and THEN become legend?

The Red Dead wiki has a subsection of posses, so I figured I'd go ahead and try to form one.  The name had to be something iconic, so I went with our beloved mammalian overlord.  I also threw up a little google site to host some information.  I'm still working on it, but I think it's a good beginning.

The only real rule is to have a microphone so we can communicate when we're stomping on fools.  The Tumbleweed rule I thought of as a sort of metagame.  Every gang needs a hideout, right?  I thought it would be interesting to have a base of operations in any particular free roam, to protect at all costs.  I envisioned a posse of 9 holding off the other players roaming around on the map.  Though maybe El Presidio or Fort Mercer would be a better locations.  Maybe even that one Mexican town with the gattling gun mounted to the roof of a house.  Just a spitball idea.

Also, I don't have a PS3, so if anyone wants to head that front, go for it.


Anyway, this can be fun.  If you'd like to join, just post the following information and I'll add you:

The worst part of the game?  My goddamn brainless fucking horse.  Every single time, every single mission, my horse is fighting against me.  Here's a list of the stupid shit my brainless goddamn horse does to infuriate me.

 * Walk away as soon as I get off.  Never mind that all I'm doing is skinning an animal or looting a corpse.  No, I have to call out over or go running after you every time.

 * Staying too close to me.  No, you stupid horse.  I'm trying to kill these people, now is not a good time to walk in front of me.

 * Running away from me.  You came when I called you, that's good.  However, running in front of me staying just barely out of reach is not good.  This happens about every 3 minutes.  I think my horse does it on purpose.

 * Standing on the railroad tracks.  Every time I stop near the tracks, the horse stands there.  I had to go save it a few times.

 * Disappearing.  If you get off your horse and try to skin an animal in rough terrain, your horse will disappear.

 * Get lost in a very simple obstacle.  It's just a fence, it shouldn't take 2 minutes for you to go around it.

 * Not come when I call.  Sometimes you just don't show up.  I just stormed a cabin the woods and killed about 20 bad guys, tied this guy up and I'm slowly waddling away, whistling.  That whistling means ""come here"" not ""be a stupid fucking horse and _not_ come here.""

Is everyone else's horse so...  stupid?

I started in Mexico but eventually gave up and went to complete New Austin and West Elizabeth.  
  
The problem I ran into in Mexico was that once I got down to 6 of 8 bounties completed, it stopped registering the missions on my stats and just keeps repeating the same one over and over (it tallies them under *Bounties Alive/Dead* but not under *Bounty hunter - Neuva Paradiso*). Hendidura Grande is the one it's stuck on and the only other one I need to do after that is Laguna Barrego. I've brought the bounty back both dead and alive and I've done so many Mexican bounty missions that I've finished all of the named characters so it has gone into the ""?"" ones instead.  
  
I'm at 96.4% and aside from this, all I need to do is get the rare weapons at the various gunsmiths, discover two or three more areas and buy one more property.  
  
I discovered [this](http://socialclub.rockstargames.com/games/rdr/checklist.html) just last night; pretty cool of R\* I must say. Too bad none of the supposed links do anything though -- would have loved to click each of the missions to find the gold medal requirements.  
  
Anyway, I've come across plenty of glitches which do somewhat tarnish what is a wonderful game, but this especially sucks because it's actually preventing me from reaching 100%. I've tried starting at both Chuparosa and Escalera. I thought El Presidio was an option too but no posters seem to be appearing there. I have tried resetting my PS3 (well, it froze so I was forced to) but it made no difference. has anyone else experienced the bounty problem?  
  
---  
  
**e:** Completed it! I know this thread (and sub) is dead but I found this out through Googling so this could easily help others in the same way in the future.  
  
I did most of my bounty missions by getting close enough to make all the red markers appear on my mini-map, but then standing at a distance and using my sniper to pick each enemy off. Turns out this strategy is what was making the game not register the mission as a Nuevo Paraiso bounty (even though it did count it in the total bounties dead/alive tally).  
 
All I had to do then was get the US Marshal outfit so I now have 100%. :)  
  
---  
  
**What do you think of currency in R\* games?**  
  
While I love R\* and the games they produce, the one main criticism I have with their games in general is currency. Money is always extremely easy to collect yet almost useless. The only time I spent any money in RDR was when I had to as part of a mission or a requirement for 100%.  
  
I played the game as a good guy so whenever a mission gave me the option of handing over some money or keeping it, I always paid. Obviously I've done all the hunter/survivalist/sharpshooter missions and I skin (almost) every single thing I kill -- the only time I don't skin is when I'm trying to get somewhere and a pack or wolves jump me, for example. So you can imagine how much provisions I have stacked up and I still haven't sold a single item yet. At the same time, I rarely bother looting dead bodies. While I've won a little bit on games, it's nothing worth talking about.  
  
So, despite spending money on everything necessary for 100%, yet not selling anything I've collected, nor looting much, I still stand here with $5.645.  
  
My stats show the following:  
  
Snake oil used - 2  
Moonshine used - 5  
Chewing tobacco used - 2  
Medicine used - 1  
Bait used - 2  
Horse pills used - 3  
  
I recall using moonshine once or twice, but I can safely say the rest of that stuff was used accidentally through trying to use the campsite too quickly. I can't remember whether any missions force you to buy anything, but I know I never bought any consumables myself other than horse deeds, yet I currently own 5 x Apple; 3 x Medicine; 4 x Bait; 2 x Vittles; 2 x Tonic; 1 x Snake Oil; 1 x Moonshine and 1 x Horse Pills.  
  
So, once I've sold all my provisions and consumables I am going to have a lot of useless money. I guess my point is that R\* should make things more relevant instead of just throwing a load of stuff in simply as optional extras. *Make* me play poker to earn enough to buy that weapon which I *really do* need. They also either need to forget about property or make it essential to us. It's alright in GTA because you can only save at a property, and in Vice City/San Andreas properties came with perks. But this game allows you to save *anywhere* at *any point* -- if not via campsite, then by selecting a horse deed. Not only that, but it auto-saves after *every* little task you complete. Furthermore, I seemed to notice that if you die in (or near?) a town, when it reloads your game, you remain at the safe-house in that town rather than whichever safe-house you last saved at (as is the case in GTA). All of those things makes extra property even more useless than the currency -- especially when most of them are in the middle of nowhere in places which missions don't even require you to go to. I even get the impression R\* know this themselves, which is why they made it a requirement to purchase every property, although it doesn't explain the point of rentable properties lol. The same thing applies to weapons; I completed the story without ever having to purchase a weapon but then to get 100%, I'm forced to purchase a collection of rare weapons.  
  
The only other trivial thing I would criticise is the Bandana. It makes sense for it protect your honour, but if you leave it on until you lose your wanted level, it doesn't make sense for you to still have a bounty once you take it off. Despite all that stuff and the numerous glitches, as well as the classic R\* combat controls (&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;) the game itself was pretty awesome. I loved the soundtrack and some of the features of the game were very innovative. I do kind of wish it had ended when John died though (or rather, I wish he hadn't died at all!).

I loved the tongue-in-cheek humor of their first few games such as Lazlow's radio banter and ""gruppe sechs"" armored cars. But then I played GTA4 and was blown away by how they scaled this back, made it more mature, and then melded into a plausible simulation of a life of crime in NYC.

The narrative was fleshed out in a much better manner than the previous games and more importantly, felt original. It wasn't a rip-off of Scarface or an homage to NWA (back when ice cube was cool). Granted, this was plagued by constant distractions which both further increased the illusion of a city functioning all around the player and hampered the ""what I want when I want"" gameplay we had all grown accustomed to.

..And then came Red Dead Redemption. From the beginning of the game, I felt indebted to Bonnie for saving John. I appreciated being shown how to aim and ride a horse, even though I more-or-less already knew how. I ran through a hail of bullets, chugging medicine, to save her! I *gasp* cared about the characters! I hated the government men, I sympathized with my old gang!

I got home and I thought John was in a dream or something! Holy shit, I get to spend time with my wife &amp; son (I was so sure they were dead)!? This happy ending to John's tale left me with this foreboding feeling... Are gangsters going to pop out of the bushes and kill my son in revenge? Will we see a black plume of smoke coming from Beecher's Hope on the way back?

So yesterday, around 9:30ish, I had a posse together and it was massive. We just decided to go to Gaptooth Breach for the heck of it, and of course we did the hideout really quickly because our posse was so huge. And of course at the end of that hideout you get the stagecoach, right?

We all piled in and started heading off, not knowing exactly where to go yet but we were chatting and thinking of good places. As we were on the road leaving the hideout, one guy from another posse (green) approaches us and the guys in the stagecoach pulled their guns on him, ready to defend the coach if need be.

Well, the green guy felt threatened, I suppose, and hit us with a stick of dynamite, killing us all and destroying the stagecoach... (these guys proceeded to follow us around the map on their Zebra Donkeys, invincible because they'd hacked so we couldn't shoot them, and scream into their mics about how WE TRIED TO KILL THEM AND THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT)

we switch sessions

it's maybe 10:30.

One of my gang lieutenants gets the idea to go to El Presidio, because cannons. So we head there and we're just screwing around getting bounties, killing policemen, etc.. until another posse shows up. They're an straw yellow-green. We start shooting it out and everything's fine until their posse begins to vote to kick one of our posse members for playing ""casual."" (His targeting mode wasn't Expert and he'd just picked up the game again after a month or so.)

We all leave the area so they won't bother us and they'll leave poor Normal Targeting Mode alone. Why not go to Gaptooth Breach again, we say, and try to get the coach?

We go back, and as we're doing the hideout the straw yellow posse appears. ""We just want the stagecoach,"" their leader says. ""You guys can have the XP, we just want the coach.""

""Why?"" say I.

""To be dicks."" so i play along, go ahead, take it, etc. and naturally they don't. They then tell us that we can have it. So reluctantly we take it. And they start ganging us and following us around the map. Sound familiar?

Switch sessions.

We do it again and one of our posse members uses the Explosive Rifle a bit too close. Stagecoach = gone.

We do it again and a randomer comes across as we're pushing the cart and they shoot the horses. Stagecoach = gone.

We do it again, and someone does something either deliberately or accidentally. I'd asked everyone not to use dynamite near it, but boom goes the dynamite. Stagecoach = gone.

We finally get the darn thing and head off to Mexico... the trouble is, it's glitching. There's like 2 people in the passenger seat, guys keep getting glitched out onto the road and then back again. The horses die spontaneously. Stagecoach = gone.

at this point i realized that I probably wasn't meant to play the game today or something. So, long story short, our posse headed up to Tanner's Span and had a giant fistfight on the bridge, then we all went to hunt bears with our fists. (This was maybe 1:30-2:00 AM.)

good times. 

and if you ever want that freakin' stagecoach, I would advise not telling anyone that's not in your posse.

My question is this: is there really anything more to the gameplay of UN besides running around saving towns and doing a few missions that involve shooting hordes and hordes of zombies, or does the game change it up a little? 

Don't get me wrong, saving towns and shooting zombies is a great concept especially for this game, but I don't really see myself dedicating enough time to Undead Nightmare to complete it if there isn't a little more variety introduced. 

I'm going to be buying the GOTY finally (but mostly for the new Hardcore mode). Just wondering what everyone thought of it, and if you had any information that could help me decide on whether or not I'll give UN another go.

The challenge is that you have to kill 5 undead in 1 Dead Eye meter.
On the Wiki, it says the easiest way is to apply Phosphorous Coating to your ammo, then go into Dead Eye and quickly kill 5 undead with head shots. 

I just did that, in fact I killed like 8 of them before Phosphorous wore off, and they all were laying dead in a blue flame. The thing is, that every time I fire a shot, it exits Dead Eye, and I have to activate it again. Is it not working because I'm exiting Dead Eye with each shot? And if so, is there a way to keep Dead Eye activated while I fire multiple rounds?

I've already tried the method using Undead Bait, Fire Bottles, and then either a stick of Dynamite or the Explosive Rifle, but I can never get it the Dynamite or the Explosive Rifle to kill 5 undead at the same time. 

This is really frustrating. Any help would be appreciated!

So as the title says, a week ago I came to the subreddit looking for advice on what to do differently towards a Let's Play on RDR and I got some amazing responses from you guys and I'm officially looking forward to bring you guys the videos.

Originally, I was only going to be doing the storyline, as it's something I usually try to do with more open world games, but I figured from what you guys have said I'm going to have more fun with it and do a lot more on the side.

I really am excited to actually play with the mindset of more a classic villain in these times, so shooting up saloons, kidnapping women and leaving men in the middle of the desert sound like a pretty fun idea for the character.

I also plan to have small multiplayer breaks in the series too where I just do a game or two over on Xbox Live with some shenanigans (Though I'm pretty bad at multiplayer, still absolute fun when it comes to fisti-cuffs!) and release small clips here and there for that to take a break from the norm. 

I'm still trying to get everything down and right, and I'm not sure how I should be doing the first episode too, I guess it's one of the episodes you need to push through! Oh well, should be fun!

But once again, thanks for all the advice, I really do appreciate it. I love making videos like this and immersing myself in the characters, so if you guys are interested, I'll probably be releasing them later sometime this week.

And as an added bonus, my artist did the artwork for it already, and looks absolutely amazing. c:

I've been playing Friendly Free Roam solidly for about a week now and with the recent triple XP event I've managed to get close to my third Legend.  
  
Free Roam can be great fun if you have one or two people to regularly posse up with and hideouts are pretty easy sources of XP once you get a good rhythm going within the team. Great. Now, the thing I can't bring myself to knuckle down to, no matter how hard I try, are Gang Matches. I've done most of the Free Roam challenges so I decided that tonight I would go for as many Weapon challenges as I could. However the whole experience just makes me hate my favourite game.  
  
Hell, there is more bullshit to be seen in Gang Matches than there is in *Call of Duty*. Most of the stand-offs at the beginning have an uneven amount of players, so the winner of that is pretty much determined before you even start. Then in the match itself, I probably spend 90% of my time just trying to find a decent weapon and a Dead Eye pick-up.  
  
It's not that I'm bad; in fact, I often play pretty well, it's just often so hard to kill somebody that when I do, it feels more like luck than skill. I don't see why you can't just spawn with *some* Dead Eye because it's almost impossible to kill without it. As soon as you've fired your first shot, anyone with a better weapon and/or Dead Eye will just cream you.  
  
Then there's the spawn system itself. Once a good player has a powerful weapon, all they have to do is creep around the circumference of the map and they'll be able to pick everyone off as soon as they spawn -- I often spawn right next to people who are doing this. On a match I played before, there was a cannon located on the roof of a building in the middle, and the rest of the map was mostly just open space. A guy was up there repeatedly firing the cannon at us over and over as soon as we re-spawned; meanwhile his team-mates were running around collecting bags. It was pretty much impossible to get out of this cycle but eventually I managed to pick him off with no less than about 6 rifle rounds while he was busy going for my team-mate.  
  
From my experience so far, you either play against bad players and win, or you play against good players and get absolutely demolished. There's no in-between. I've even started sending posse requests to all the high level players during the intermissions. 
  
RDR single player is the best game I've ever played. I have no idea how anybody can get anything done in Normal and Expert Free Roam, considering the amount of fuck heads there are even in Friendly -- nevertheless, Free Roam is a nice extension to the game. Gang Matches just ruin all of this.",,False,self,t5_2rn7o,False,,,True,t3_jxmby,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/jxmby/does_anybody_actually_enjoy_multiplayer/,

I just got around to completing the last missions in Cochinay and returning to that one important place. However, I discovered you can't change outfits after that point and the Rancher Outfit becomes the default for John until... well, the end of John's portion of the game. 

I have desperately wanted to get the US Marshal outfit recently; with this outfit I would have all 17 (16 without Rancher) for John. But because you can't change outfits, this is a big issue for me. Yes, I could always do it as Jack but a big part of getting the Marshal outfit was being able to wear it as John. That was always one of my goals in this game -- being able to see John in every outfit before I was forced to play as Jack. (I know you can't wear the Army outfit as John.. so technically it's 15 outfits.)

Luckily (*very* luckily) for me, I had a previous save. My precious last save was right before the beginning of ""And You Will Know the Truth,"" which as we all know leads directly into the next mission with the Dutch confrontation whether you want it to or not.

**So.**

My saves will go a bit like this...

* Save #1 will be the precious one that I'm glad I still have -- the one before the last Agent Ross missions. That will be the one that'll still allow me to adventure and roam the countryside as John. I'll complete the US Marshal outfit prereqs on this one, save it in Save 1, then continue and redo the Ross missions to proceed to a new save...


* Save #2 will be John at the ranch, after the Agent Ross missions. Naturally I will continue using this save in the storyline until ""The Last Enemy That Shall Be Destroyed,"" at which point I'll cease doing the story missions and - you guessed it - run around as rancher John.


* and lastly Save #3 will be... Jack. There's a reason why I haven't finished this game in the year 2013. You guessed it -- I love playing as John. But I have to play as Jack for 100% completion, and this is how I'll do it. 

Never before have I had such a structured plan for a game's saves. But I think this game merits it, don't you?

^and ^i'm ^really ^glad ^i ^still ^have ^that ^first ^save ^because ^when ^i ^was ^riding ^home ^after ^cochinay ^and ^Compass ^was ^playing ^I ^turned ^off ^the ^map ^for ^more ^immersion ^and ^it ^was ^a ^really ^beautiful ^moment ^until ^my ^horse ^got ^stuck ^in ^some ^rocks, ^killed ^by ^wolves, ^and ^the ^song ^was ^abruptly ^cut ^off. ^grr. ^i'll ^be ^eager ^to ^replay ^it.",,False,self,t5_2rn7o,1371767022.0,,titlebox,True,t3_1gr9ez,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1gr9ez/rolling_saves_and_why_they_rule_in_this_game/,

I believe that the ending was appropriate, in case youre one of the people who didnt see the actual ending, Im talking about where Jack gets revenge. 

My idea for a sequel (its very general, nothing hugely specific):
Its couple years after the events in in Red Dead, Jack is struggling to maintain the ranch. He makes a few close friends, like buddys, maybe some people from McFarlane's ranch, and an older Bonnie would be involved too. Jack also has a lady friend (girlfriend, wife, whatever) who is iffy on the relationship and the ranch. 

The main conflict would be that the ranch needs money, cattle, pretty much everything. It has almost nothing. Jack needs (whatever amount of money) to keep the ranch going and has to go out and do the typical outlaw deeds like his father John did. The government will take his land and sell it (or tear it down) if he fails.

Since this is in the future kind of, there would access to some cars, but horses are of course the main source of travel. Maybe a plane.

Jack also has an internal conflict because he realizes that he is heading down a similar road that his dad went down. His lady friend trys to tell him this throughout the game, but his main goal is to keep and maintain the ranch. 

I cant think of many people that can transfer over into the sequel, maybe a rich Seth losing his money, or the snail oil salesman (his name escapes me) can be involved. The only one I can see clearly would be Bonnie, her father dies and she becomes the head of her ranch. She offers to help Jack with his ranch, in return he helps her with her ranch. There can a scene where she is shot and its all epic and emotional where she tells Jack that he is just like his dad.

General idea. I have some smaller ideas, but I dont wanna make this any longer than it already is.",,False,self,t5_2rn7o,False,,,True,t3_1gmtoq,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1gmtoq/idea_for_rdr_sequel/,

If not: **Spoilers below from the start**.
  
---  
  
I currently have my game paused during my first mission playing as Jack Marston (John's son) and I'm riding with his mother back to their farm where John has just been killed.  
  
At this point, the first thing that occurred to me is that I've now lost my whole inventory. I still have my cash, but all my items and weapons are gone.  
  
The reason I decided to pause the game and make a post on reddit is because I need to know something before it auto-saves and it's too late: Should I reload my game and sell all my items before redoing this mission, or will I get all of John's items once I return? I don't want to go back yet just in case it auto-saves as soon as I arrive.  
  
Also: As soon as the cut-scene ends where John opens the barn doors to face all the officers and bounty-hunters outside, you regain control (now, I'm not sure whether I did this or if the game did it itself) but I was instantly in dead-eye with a revolver. As I was concentrating too much on selecting a weapon and wasn't expecting dead-eye to show up (in the cut-scene John isn't holding any weapons so I thought he was giving himself up), I only managed to mark one guy. However, I'm sure if I redid this mission I'd be able to mark at least a considerable amount -- if not all of them. I'm just wondering if anyone knows whether this is possible or if there are any other details surrounding this scene?  
  
**TL;DR**  
1. When John dies, do you lose all his items?  
2. In the very last scene just before John is shot dead, can you kill a considerable amount of the soldiers?
  
---
 
Just to throw my two cents in; I'm disappointed with the direction the story is going now. I'll be honest and admit that I already knew that John dies at some point, but I didn't know anything more than that -- or that you played as any other character.  
  
[This article](http://reflectiongamer.wordpress.com/2010/06/06/red-dead-redemptions-ending-was-a-joke/) sums up my sentiments to a tee. It refers to the sense of accomplishment felt once you finally kill Dutch and the cool music that plays (albeit extremely brief in my case, not sure if it was supposed to be longer like the Mexico one?). It also mentions how that is like an ending to the story in itself and that from there on in, every ""story mission"" is just filler leading up to a bit of a lame ""twist"". I must say I completely agree. I do enjoy the rancher and cowboy missions, but still, it's all a bit pointless when a few missions later your whole life gets fucked up. I was actually expecting something similar to *San Andreas* where even after the story is complete, you must work to maintain control of your hood -- i.e. you would be alerted to rustlers and would have to protect your herd. This would make even more sense playing as Jack, as John even had a conversation with him about growing up and maintaining *'the best ranch in the whole of West Elizabeth'*. Instead, you just commit suicide and lose everything only to embark on another revenge mission (so I gather).  
  
Of course, I still have a considerable amount of the further story to complete (I'm currently ~80%), but a revenge mission played as the son will surely seem rather repetitive when up to now the whole game has pretty much been a revenge mission played as the father.  
  
Whatever happens, this is one of the best games I have ever played and I think it is extremely underrated. It saddens me that this sub seems almost dead, although if *GTA IV* is anything to go by, R\*'s multiplayer could be to blame. Then again, I **still** have the multiplayer waiting for me to get stuck into once I've completed the single player.

The first bear I got a OHK on, I wasn't sure about so I just kept on looking. Since then, I am 100% certain I've had at least three OHKs on bears -- shotgun to the face from about 8 feet away.  
  
I couldn't help  noticing that each time I got one, the challenge meter wasn't filling up. Even though I should have now completed the challenge, the meter is *still* empty. After the third, I continued to get one or two more OHKs; I even tried the Throwing knife, but still nothing.  
  
My other challenges have partial completion and coincidently, after the third definite OHK, I unlocked the trophy *Bearly Legal - Kill and skin 18 grizzly bears* -- so I know they are registering as bear kills.  
  
Anybody got any clues as to what's going on?

Usual story I finally bought my own copy of RDR after using my roommates all this time, now that I no longer live with him.

Unfortunately my new game is freezing **constantly** if I was to start a new game I would only be able to get up to ""New friends, old enemies"" before a freeze would happen, (or sometimes before that point)

If I load my ""old"" save games with a 100% story completion it will freeze after a few minutes of gameplay in much the same fashion.

Here is what I have done:

1.  Decided to delete all my old saves and hdd files, start over again new (still freezes)
2.  Update the game via xbox live (still freezes)
3.  delete the Xbox 360 HDD cashe and play the orginal version (still freezes)
4.  Reinstall updates (still freezes)

Now I did check online and on Rockstars page they say to contact Xbox 360 customer support (oh joy of joys) They basically told me to do the above steps, then try on a friends xbox (that I don't have)

Is it possible for the Disc itself to be faulty?  Will going back to the store and swapping over the disc fix my problem? Xbox wants 180 dollars from me for a out of warranty service with no guarantee they can fix a problem for one game.

Can you guys help me out?

For the cougar, go hijack a wagon. Any wagon will do. Drive that thing right up into cougarville, and serve those motherfuckers some serious lead from your improvised tank. 

For the $5000 bounty, go to Rethskeller Fork (top left of the map). Get on top of the southern adobe building (not the barn). You can do this by going to one of the window covers that is propped up on the back or side, and pressing your jump button to climb onto it.

Then, once on top, go to the wall facing the east gateway, and kill something (the dog works). The lawmen will just keep piling in through that gate, allowing you to fuck their world over. Do this alone or with a friend. A friend makes it slightly easier since you *will* run out of ammo and have to go around gathering up all the weapons they leave when you shoot them in the face.

**edit** Hmm, I suppose I shouldn't say I totally owned a challenge if I died 30 times doing it.... but still. Kill those cougars. I hate them so much.

To make sure you're doing it right, just use the wall for cover, and pop up a shoot once or twice, then go back down.

Okay, I bought Red Dead Redemption when it came out, but never got through it all and sold it.
Just bought the GOTY Edition for 30 bucks.

There's a certain mission: Wild Horses, Tamed Passion.

What. The. Fuck.

There HAS to be a certain way to tame the horses, and I've literally had to restrain myself, with difficulty, from snapping the disc in half.
It is THE most frustrating thing I've ever encountered in a video game.

Does ANYONE know how to get through it?

My tactics are holding down on the left thumbstick, and shifting it to the left or right depending on which position the horse is pulling. (for example: if it's pulling left, I pull right.)

This may have been posted before, but i highly doubt it, because it's pretty random.

So anyway, to the point; this only really works on the blackwater graveyard map, what you do is get on to the very top of the blue house to the south-east-ish of the graveyard, walk near the edge, get your fists out and start punching towards the edge of the roof with a clear vertical drop to the ground, as you punch you will move forward, you have to try and fall off the edge while punching so that as you fall you fall as if you were standing (so you don't fall as a ragdoll). Then when you respawn you will have the knife instead of the torch.

Definitely one of the better zombie games I've played, but I feel it can be too easy and at times the tension doesn't build up enough. 

For example, once you clear the towns, the towns are completely void of zombies. But it says it's clear but zombies might still be around. Where? In the outskirts, yeah, but nowhere else in the town. It just takes away from tension that could've been there. For example, you clear the town and you go exploring for ammo. It would've been cool if there were still random single zombies scattered around, hanging in a room of the hotel or in an alley. It would keep you on your toes cause you still don't know where they are. As is, you just walk around like nothing is going on. 

I know zombies can't climb ladders, but there should be something to make taking a town more difficult. If you get on top of a building, which is relatively easy, then you have that town cleared no problem.

**Limited customization.**  

* I love the sandbox feel, but why can't I choose what hat/shirt/jacket/pants/boots combo I want to wear? 
  
* Why can't I put a horse snuggie on to make him super awesome? 

* Why can't I dip my shotgun in silver and call it sweet and sassy? 

* Why not let me build my own weapon combinations for different effects (ala borderlands?) 

* Why can't I buy a house and hang my animal heads I hunted or change what furniture I have? 

* Why can I have a pet dog, cougar, etc..?  
  


**Can't have sex with hookers.**  

* I get I'm a family man, but if I'm playing as pure evil does it really matter?  
* The next game should let you have sex with everyone and everything! LOL  


I'm loving this game a lot, but I think the game wants to give you a sense of freedom, but in reality it's all about the story.

""Shiola"" by Murder by Death


I steal a look between the blinds

I unwind 

she sleeps in comfort in my arms

She is plain but she is mine

Our child is silent but awake

I run my hands through his hair

I teach him manners and how to stick up 

For himself when things get bad


I tell him son never through the first punch

And If you must fight, make it clean

SHIOLA, SHIOLA, will all be forgiven?

SHIOLA, SHIOLA, Am I strong enough to start again alone?

The taste of home is filling up my mouth

Is it wrong to love a family of ghosts

Her door is open the windows are all up

She says ""come inside""



I live alone more or less

I summon, child and happiness

Build them up from the dirt and clay

I have to believe that all will be forgiven

SHIOLA, SHIOLA, will all be forgiven?

SHIOLA, SHIOLA, am I strong enough to start again alone?

SHIOLA, SHIOLA, my heart is overflowing

SHIOLA, SHIOLA, with love and anger coiled into one

They take and take

But never get their fill

I try and try

But fail against my will

I wait and wait for that hand to sweep me up

And take me down that road",,False,self,t5_2rn7o,False,,,True,t3_1ezvlz,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1ezvlz/i_would_like_to_share_with_you_a_song_that/,

Make ur own character and chose to be on the north or south side in the civil war (along with better characters and features). Also if rockstar is able to make it like skyrim u should be able to hav a family but no nude scenery.

If rockstar cant make it like skyrim i think they should make a better story (dont get me wrong rdr's story was GREAT) and they should incllude a much bigger map amd more terrotories. I also think that the story should go along with rdr or just completely different.

An other theory is to set the time around the 1840s when mexico and the US were fighting for Texas. There should be slaves that u can choose to raise or free from plantations (slaves would be white and black). 

But in every. Theory u should be able to: hang ppl, whip ppl, fishing, boating, maybe swimming, train robbing, real store &amp; bank robbing like stealing from the cash register, get jobs like a sheriff-miner-ect., if u get in a fist fight u SHOULD DEFFINITLY BE ABLE TO KNOCK SUMONE OUT LONG ENOUGH SO THRE CAN ACTUALLY BE A WINNER (and if u get sumone knocked out u should be able to keep pounding their face so tey can possibly die), farming, NO sexual interaction (becuz that can ruin the chance of a kid or teen with stricter parents not to be able to get this game, digging, and a few other ideas that in sure rockstar will take care of, and oh...

The end parts of the game honestly evoke an emotional response from me because of the relationship I never really had with my dad.

He decided to cheat on my mom and decided that his new family with my ""stepmom"" was far more important, but I digress.

John finally gets to be with his family, gets to show Jack how to hunt and herd cattle and such other things. But knowing what is to come is really fucking saddening and infuriating to me.
John and his family are finally together for only about 3 damn days and what happens? John gets fucking murdered by those lying, perverse, conniving sons-of-bitches. You don't even have a chance. You and Uncle are taken on by an army of a hundred and Uncle dies. This should be no big deal, right? I mean, John has decimated waves of outlaws and Mexican army members by himself so this should be the end of it and John can go back to his family. HELL NO!

Okay, this should be the part where you just take a stick of dynamite and blow these bastards to smithereens. Nope, you get to take out 1-3 of them with a pistol, instead. Jack and Abigail go back to see John had been shot about umpteen times and he's just gone in a pool of blood.

So about 2 or 3 years ago, I borrowed RDR from a friend and thought it was lame. I had always liked GTA, and saw that RDR was also by Rockstar so I was kind of disappointed. Anyway, gave it back and didn't think anything of it. Fast forward a couple years, sometime in August last year, I borrowed it again, from a different friend, and I really got into it. Alright so fast forward again, like a week later, I'm at a mall and I see a Gamestop so I go in, I'm browsing and low and behold I see ""Red Dead Redemption: Game of the Year Edition"" for only $30! Obviously I got it, and I played it until just before you go to Mexico. Then, I don't remember exactly what happened I think I just got bored with it and started playing some other game, but I totally forgot about it. Well my birthday was this weekend, and I ordered Crysis 3 &amp; Dishonored from Amazon. Needless to say, the anticipation was killing me. I was bored with most of my other games, and was looking for something to hold me over until I could get my hands on my pretties! Then I remembered I hadn't beat RDR yet. JACKPOT! So now I am really close to beating it, I'm back with my family on our ranch, and unfortunately my dickhead friend ruined the ending for me. *SPOILER* he said something about John getting shot and dying, and then you playing is Jack in free roam *END OF SPOILER*. I just beat the mission where you have to kill all the crows on the silo for your wife, and now I'm scared to finish the game. And now I'm typing this, scared and depressed. Any advice?

P.S. AND I'm still waiting for Crysis 3 and Dishonored!

How did you guys end the quest?

Not realizing the whole time the quest saved the game as soon as I finished it. But then I admitted to her that had she not been in the room I would have put the poor Sasquatch out of his misery.

What I suggest, or at least would be a great way to continue his story would be an Animated movie, or series based around Jack Marston, and perhaps on a hunt based around his Fathers killers, and perhaps leading to the Governor whom the two Marshall's spoke of who wanted Dutch and the others dead to begin with...

A great way to begin the whole thing would be Jack riding up to Ross telling him he had a message, then the duel... A good way to start the movie/series..

* I joined as a loner and stared a posse with 3 randoms and did the usual stronghold missions.

Suddenly 2 of our guys got sniped, we then realised that the 8 other players were all converging on El Presidio trying to take us out - they were completely surrounding us. It was like a mission from story mode - we were trying our hardest not to let them overthrow the fort and eventually after much death they gave up.

* After the fort we decided we needed to teach these upstarts a lesson so our posse roamed the land hunting these other 8 guys - we were all around Armadillo slaughtering them. I then noticed they were all running away and on the minimap the lack of colour in the players 'dots' - only 2: white (us) and blue? I checked the map and saw the other 8 guys had gotten sick of us harassing them and formed a posse of their own! - All 8 of them were tightly packed in a nearby settlement 1 minute from Armadillo - it's like they were planning something. We ""Circled the Wagons"" and got ready - they attacked full force; blazing into town in a fully packed horse and carriage throwing dynamite out all windows.

It really seemed drawn out. The first half was great, you wanted to get into the fort, it featured a quintessential western town, loads of sherriff missions and also ranch type missions and you know, general western fun. Also, Nigel West Dickens is pretty hilarious.

Come the second half you're under the arm of De Santa. All the mexicans are the same jubilous type and they seriously could have replaced all their dialogue with ARRIBA! REVOLUTION! and I would have cared as much. Landon Rickets was a godsend, being even more hardened and grizzled than Marston and offering interesting dialogue. I'm slugging through it now but only in small doses as I have better games to play...

And the DLC. EUGH, utter rubbish. I have only ever quit a game out of sheer disrespect for the game twice. The first time was in(and this is going to destroy all my credibility) The Elder Scrolls Morrowing and the second, 30 min into Undead Nightmare. I'd been treated to an overly long cutscene explaining nothing and instead taking one of my favourite characters and turning him into a joke by ripping apart his established personality, making him an idiot and putting him into skintight pajamas. Read: Losing faith in character design for this DLC.

After realising I have to galantly ride away from my home I arrive at a big huge, empty, pointless, lonely and stale town. I really mean empty and I know that the zombie invasion has culled the numbers of the town but srsly that town is cavernous.. full of nothing it takes 3 seconds to cross the damn street... Read: Lost faith in the level design of the rest of the DLC.

I meet characters who are stupid and mean nothing to me, add nothing to the plot and are generally boring as all hell. Read: Faith in interesting characters takes a nosedive.

I then go and clear out a graveyard which mediates between boring and frustrating and then slightly engaging and fun before reverting to bland and clunky again. Read: Heavily lost faith in gunplay.

I return to town now looking for any saving grace before I am told that the previous fighting and cleansing I have done, is actually temporary... what? I need to do it AGAIN? *Eject disk, reject the notion of snapping the disk, send message to friend about wanting to return the game*

And I have to say...the ending was a massive let down for me.

It's like Niko Bellic fucking off back to Russia/Serbia/Balkan/whatever and leaving you to play as Roman or Kate (depending on how you chose to deal with a certain in game mission ending).

I liked John! He was the perfect, if not cliched, character for the game. Being Jack for the rest of the game in my eyes, SUCKS. I understand John was a killer but the whole Redemption thing in the title would allude one to assume he was turned around for the better and would therefore be allowed to live in peace. No does he shite. And the Honour system, what's the point in having it at all and maxing it out either way if there's no endgame effect? 

Honestly, the decision to play as Jack should not have been forced upon the player, playing the game in a certain way should influence the ending as one would imagine that if your Honour was 3/4's full on the Negative side or more, you can guarantee you'd be dying at the end as you had committed more crime and the likes. Whereas doing all the honourable shit like hog tying thieves instead of killing them and rescuing the Working Girls from being murdered etc is rendered redundant at the end as it means nothing ultimately. 

I honestly love this game and really really enjoyed playing through it and experiencing that savage world. But killing John off without so much as giving us any sort of power to change it, really makes me angry. I actually threw my pad down in disgust and turned it off when I realised what had happened, it just made no sense. It seemed like all that time and effort in getting into the character and watching him in cutscenes etc just made me think, fuck I may as well have been playing a Flashback game and he was dead all along, that would of suited better and would have EASILY been explained via creative direction of plot and timeline narration.

(Though it was incredibly satisfying to kill Ross and his family. I semi-auto shotgunned his wife on the porch and same for his brother both pretty much point blank...felt good to get justice granted but that wasn't enough to make me like Jack as much as his flea bitten scarred mother fucking bad ass of a dad).

The game stopped working a few days later, would always refuse to load or glitch and end up with me stuck in the ground or something. I then returned it.

I recently remembered how awesome the game is, and bought it again, completely forgetting about the fact that it stopped working on my PS3. Continued having the same glitches.

I tried deleting the game data and reinstalling, and it didn't work, so I tried more stuff which also didn't work.

I then completely restored the PS3, *losing two years of data* including movies, music, and all my savegames except for the three which I absolutely couldn't lose, and copied to my flash drive.

After setting everything up again, signing into PSN, updating the game, it said there was a problem with my game data and had to reinstall. Not a great start.

Then it refused to get past the loading screen.

So I restored again, and this time I changed nothing that wasn't absolutely necessary for gameplay (e.g., I set up HDMI output). I didn't even set it up to connect to the network, or restore the gamesaves from my flash drive.

The game still refused to move past the loading screen. It's now running on a system which should operationally be 100% identical to one which is new from the box, and the opening cutscene is missing a lot of dialogue, and it won't let me actually play the game.

This means that Rockstar has done such a shitty job at maintaining the game that it's not even compatible with the latest version of the PS3 firmware.

This is fucking impossible, but I really don't see any other explanation for the fact that I'm not riding a horse around and shooting outlaws right now.

So, seriously, what's going on?",,False,self,t5_2rn7o,False,,,True,t3_pf780,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/pf780/apparently_ps3_is_no_longer_a_platform_which/,

So now I'm in Normal mode and I'm trying to get the 10 assists Trophy but everyone is fucking shit. I've been tagging along with other people to gang hideouts and playing as terribly as I can but there comes a point where I'm forced to kill the enemies myself, otherwise we're simply going to die.  
  
There were a few moments where I was sure I was going to get an assist, but it turned out the enemy had already healed before he was finally killed. On a couple of other occasions I even shot them twice (with a pause in between) and I *still* didn't get the assist.  
  
I've been doing it with Normal aiming, but I may try out Expert so that I can manually sweep over all the enemies rather than being automatically locked on to the ones nearest me.  
  
Oh yeah, if anyone is on PS3, I'd love to play some games with you. I'm actually going to be going for the team game Trophy soon and I've got plenty of challenges to go for too, so that would be cool. :)

Then get in close and take out the gun of your choice, personally I'm a fan of the sawed-off shotgun. After this, lock on and shoot them as if you were doing a close-range execution. Instead of shooting them in the gut, J. Marston will lower the barrel to the middle of their face and completely implode their cranium.

The game sort of just gives you this huge bomb of an ending and then just leaves you there lol. I'm so impressed yet still confused that I'm just going to turn my xbox off for now and see what anyone here has to say about it.

He has no reason to lie to me, but here are the messages he sent me on PS3 in one passage. ""Just got hacked. A group of 3 guys asked me to join their posse. They were the highest rank so I joined so I wouldn't have to worry about them fucking with me. The did there own thing at first. Then I went to the Pleasance House near Armadillo. That's when they all spawned in front of me side by side. All 3 of them. They were all creepy looking zombies might I add. I got on my horse to leave, and go back to the Sheriff's office in Armadillo, because I was role playing as a detective. I didn't manage to get very far, because I turned to look at the posse leader immediately after mounting my horse. When we made eye contact, my horse began whinying, and my screen began to get red as if someone was shooting at me. I couldn't move. A few seconds later, my hourse dropped dead, and you could blood (I kid you not) spurting out of his neck. My character started flailing as he rolled down the hill, my screen getting darker, and darker. Just as I neared death indicated by the red on my screen. The game froze. The thing was though, I could hear the wind blowing, and crickets chirping. Mind you that the screen froze just as I was about to die, so that's the seen that I was left with. I figured that the freeze was temporary, and that I would just resume rolling down the hill, slowly recovering from this unseen danger. WAS I FUCKING WRONG......Like five seconds later, my screen just goes black, so I'm just like ""what the fuck just happened?"" Right as I said that, my screen flashed this close up of Poe Bol the zombie's face, and this creepy ass carnival music. That's when I cut my PS3 off. Hence me being offline for like 20 minutes...Fucking creepiest thing that has ever happened to me. See, this is why you should play RDR with me."" That was all from a friend I know in real life, and he has no reason to make up some silly story and spend half an hour typing it in little bits in PSN messages. I've only played RDR Undead Nightmare, and it's been forever, so I don't know if Poe Bol is an actual character in the game, or not. Me and him always play RDR multiplayer together, and this was one of the few times I've turned down playing, to play something else. I want to know if this is a hack, or not, and if it is, if anyone else has ever experienced this. Thanks for reading, and I hope someone can give me some answers, because neither one of us know what it could have been. We both have no clue, but we do know that it was a hack, because we used to do something similar in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.",,False,self,t5_2rn7o,False,,,True,t3_1i7kjt,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1i7kjt/friend_claims_to_be_hacked_i_have_a_question_this/,
