For five days, each participant got possession of the map and was allowed to build anything they dreamed of on their section of land. Now, the building has been finished and after a bit of tweaking and playtesting, we proudly present RedditLand to you!

Here are downloads for the save files of the maps. To open them in your copy of RCT2, just copy the saved game file and paste it into the RCT2 saved games folder. 

NOTES: Due to playtesting, the open versions of both parks have a few very minor changes to them so as to fix any major flaws (for instance, guests leaving the park getting stuck because there was no easy path directly to the exit). However, the closed versions stay as close to the originals as possible.

[PR Text](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/classic-sim-game-transport-tycoon-pulling-in-to-mobile-platforms-this-year-215511701.html)

Choice quotes and my thoughts:

&gt;the original classic is poised to return, painstakingly revised for touch screen devices, and retaining every element of what made the original such a prestigious and enduring piece of entertainment.

&gt;Transport Tycoon for mobile platforms has been designed and directed by legendary game designer Chris Sawyer, the original creator of Transport Tycoon, Transport Tycoon Deluxe, and Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 &amp; 2. Veteran developers Origin8 have recreated and restored Sawyer's original simulation code, resulting in the deepest, richest simulation game yet seen on mobile.

&gt;Chris wants TYCOON lovers across the world to enjoy the experience of playing the game on an iPhone, iPad, and Android.

Although they say it will work on iPhone, like many games, it's probably much better on a larger screen.

Remember all the times I said nobody would port RCT to Android because it's in assembly and it's too expensive to port to Android? Well, somebody did it with Transport Tycoon - which is assembly code from the same person. Also, RCT started as a modification to TTD - they might share some code to this day.

Jacqui Lyons is/was with Marjcq Ltd., the agency that helps Chris Sawyer manage licensing the RCT games. I'm guessing some other names listed are also from Marjacq, but their site is down right now so I can't tell. It isn't a surprise to see someone seeking legal advice etc. from a familiar source.

If I had to guess, I'd say that any big decisions (new content or graphics and so on) are approved by Chris Sawyer. I'm also guessing that the isometric style is going to remain with the game. I'd say all-new graphics for the whole game isn't going to happen, but depending on how this port/remake is set up, it may be a necessity to have less aliasing or whatever. I'm also guessing that Chris is available to answer questions about his original source code, but is not responsible for porting the game. That seems to be Origin8's job.

&gt;In 2010, Chris had the opportunity of reverting the MicroProse license and decided that this would be the perfect time to re-design and master his classic game for mobiles and tablets

It seems that the idea behind doing *something* with Transport Tycoon is 3 years old - but the port itself might be younger.

So the only reason this didn't happen sooner is because Chris didn't have the license to Transport Tycoon? That probably includes the game code and everything. This is different from the case with RCT. [To reiterate](http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1ez8ex/i_contacted_chris_sawyers_agency_marjacq/):

&gt;Chris Sayer owns all rights including registered trademarks in the name and copyright in content. Atari has an exclusive licence from Chris Sawyer. Atari (and its successors to the licence) are the only people entitled to make new games or approve their development (in accordance with that licence). Marjacq manages Chris Sawyer's rights.

For us to see an RCT mobile port, a few things probably need to happen.

* Transport Tycoon is successfully ported to mobile
* Chris successfully negotiates a contract for a tablet RCT game

I don't know if Chris is down for the 3.4 million dollars Atari is asking for the game, though. He made 30 million or so from RCT but that's a lot of money.

Before any of you complain that this is only a mobile game, keep in mind that it's iOS and Android. That means it's coming from some kind of common programming language. It'd be fairly simple to port it again to PC. And on top of that, you don't know what this port entails. It might be better to just use OpenTTD if this is Transport Tycoon + optimized for touch interface.

LONDON, July 15, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Chris Sawyer's 31X Ltd and Origin8 Technologies Ltd are proud to announce that a revitalized version of the gaming classic Transport Tycoon will be arriving on iOS and Android platforms in late 2013.

(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130715/NE47054LOGO )

Upon its original release in 1994, Transport Tycoon was heralded as the new standard in management simulation games, remaining a high watermark in the genre almost two decades later. Now, years after making the ""Tycoon"" appellation a recognized shorthand for real time empire building games, the original classic is poised to return, painstakingly revised for touch screen devices, and retaining every element of what made the original such a prestigious and enduring piece of entertainment.

Transport Tycoon for mobile platforms has been designed and directed by legendary game designer Chris Sawyer, the original creator of Transport Tycoon, Transport Tycoon Deluxe, and Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 &amp; 2. Veteran developers Origin8 have recreated and restored Sawyer's original simulation code, resulting in the deepest, richest simulation game yet seen on mobile.

Praise for the original Transport Tycoon (PC) included:

""Buy it. Classic games like this don't come around often."" 91% - PC Gamer

""A pioneer of the business simulation genre."" - Giant Bomb

A teaser trailer can be found at: http://www.TransportTycoon.com and updates surrounding the new game can be found by liking the game Facebook.com/tycoonsim or  following @tycoonsim on Twitter.

About 31X
31X Ltd was formed by Chris Sawyer in 2010 to develop TRANSPORT TYCOON for the new generation of social and mobile platforms. Chris also developed ROLLERCOASTER TYCOON, released through Hasbro Interactive early in 1999, followed by two add-on packs Added Attractions and Corkscrew Follies in late 1999 and Loopy Landscapes in September 2000. ROLLERCOASTER TYCOON 2 soon followed and was released through Infogrames Interactive in 2002. The ROLLERCOASTER TYCOON series remains the largest selling PC only game.

Chris Sawyer is 31X's CEO, Creator and Executive Producer. He is joined by Jacqui Lyons, Executive Producer, John Hurlbut, Executive Producer, Hetal Bhuva, Producer and Guy Herbert, Legal Consultant. Chris Sawyer entered the games industry in 1983, writing games in Z80 machine code on the Memotech MTX home computer, and then the Amstrad CPC series home computer. From 1988 to 1993, Chris worked on PC conversions of Amiga games and was involved in many well-known projects, including Virus (1989), Campaign (1992), Birds of Prey (1992), Dino Dini's Goal (1993), and Frontier Elite 2 (1993).

Since 1993, Chris has been developing his own original games on the PC. In 2010, Chris had the opportunity of reverting the MicroProse license and decided that this would be the perfect time to re-design and master his classic game for mobiles and tablets so that it could be enjoyed both by its huge number of fans and a new generation of players. Chris wants TYCOON lovers across the world to enjoy the experience of playing the game on an iPhone, iPad, and Android.

Custom stations can do many things for your coaster - 1) increase excitement, 2) increase realism, and 3) it's just fun to build!

So I've compiled a quick guide to creating your own custom station. This is just a beginners' guide - feel free to add on to it to suit your own tastes. And if you have any suggestions, sound them out in the comments!



----


[Step One](http://i.imgur.com/aNgFP.png) - here we have a basic station (for the Steel Roller Coaster). 


[Step Two](http://i.imgur.com/bIy5V.png) - The first thing we want to do is lay down a perimeter of walls around our designated footprint. Here, it's 5 squares by 5 squares.


[Step Three](http://i.imgur.com/QeJGy.png) - The next thing you should do is lay down your base - in this case, the black floor. We've decided we're going for an open station, so we're using open balcony supports as walls.


[Step Four](http://i.imgur.com/GW7Zo.png) - Let's continue the walls around the coaster platform itself, so if it were built in real life it would be able to support the roof.


[Step Five](http://i.imgur.com/9cqSQ.png) - Here we've started a basic, sloping roof. The roof I'm using is a piece of custom scenery. It's labeled 'Spanish roof tile' if anyone was interested.


[Step Six](http://i.imgur.com/YikG1.png) - To lay the foundation for our continuing roof, I've added a perimeter of walls so they can support the next layer of roofing.


[Step Seven](http://i.imgur.com/tkkHc.png) - The top layer of roofing is now up. I staggered the roofline a little bit to make it look more interesting, and filled in the gap with a layer of black parapet.

[Step Eight](http://i.imgur.com/7JGD8.png) - Top it off with a simple roof (I went with the default base block) and you're done!

[Step Nine](http://i.imgur.com/iYN1M.png) - I decided to jazz it up a little bit with another parapet on the highest point of the station.


And that's pretty much it - simple, quick, and easy to make and looks wonderful paired with any setting. You can tweak with the general design and make it fit into whatever scenery is around.

Finally, some examples of how versatile this simple station is:

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/VzQYy.png)'s a design made up to look like a waterfront factory for a boat ride.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/7B3s9.png), I replaced the roof with a broad arch that lets in oodles of sunlight and gives off a sense of openness.

It's almost unrecognizable, but [this station](http://i.imgur.com/ifhTK.png) uses the same general design as the walkthrough above.

Definitely foliage, maybe ride design or park layout or something. Maybe architecture someday. We'll burn that when we get to it. But if you need a break from the sweat you're pouring into your May entry, maybe you'll enjoy reading.

There are three basic classifications to the kind of landscaping you will do, and each one has its purpose. I'm not including the ""Pick mountain tool and have a fit"" theory, as that's not visually interesting or realistic. Really your only excuse for that is in water, as you only want the land underneath the water to not be completely devoid of detail. Otherwise, no one is going to scrutinize what you've put under the water unless it's for a ride (objects, tunnels, structures, etc.).

&gt;**First school: Mounds**


Why might you want to use this? Break up those huge, flat expanses. It's okay to not have towering mountains in your park, few real-life examples do. This is a very slow transitional style. If you have no other height variation in your park, you will want to work this in somehow. Even just for a section. It will do wonders. It's also good for big stretches between path that you just want to fill with a small ride or trees. The height variation just makes the expanse a little more interesting when looking at a completed park.

You would start with something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/cHDEV.jpg), VERY rough and very blocky. Not a ton of height variation, and nothing too hasty. You can use this ""style"" for any number of levels, but this is a reasonable average. You just tweak all the edges, something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Y3DJU.jpg). Adjust shape and size according to your needs. Avoid symmetrical shapes, especially when you want a natural look.

This is the simplest way to vary your land, but going piece-by-piece can take a while. Thankfully, it's pretty difficult to mess up, so it works out as a nice middle ground between the next two. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/kvpG5.jpg)'s and example of mounds in practice. Note the slight uphill movement from right to left across the screen.

&gt;**Second school: Levels**


Arguably the most time-consuming, but the hardest to get ""wrong"", in my opinion. You'll want to use something like this if you have big leaps in height, as on mountains, cliffsides, or possibly around rides where you want the terrain to play a role in the theme.

Start with, again, a very rough setup, but with very defined levels. How much you want to flatten each of these is up to both personal preference and just how large you want this landmass to be. Since mine is just an example, it's [not too big](http://i.imgur.com/i8JsR.jpg). From there, de-exaggerate the levels. Textures will play a big roll in this style of landscaping, so bleed your surroundings in carefully. I like to keep the rock sections barren so they stick out, and I feel it makes a more realistic look overall. But you can have foliage bleed over onto rocks - RCT isn't perfect. I tried to make it a little taller overall, but mine is not [very exaggerated](http://i.imgur.com/rRYVv.jpg). The textures make most of the point.

Here's an [in-practice example](http://i.imgur.com/3nKIl.jpg) of this kind of landscaping.

&gt;**Third school: Chaos**


This is a pretty old-school style, and a lot of fantastic LL parks (and even early RCT2 parks) relied on it entirely for the dead and/or foresty sections of map. It can be the most fun to do, but it also gets tiring, and you can get it wrong very, very easily, which will just make it look sloppy. I tend to use this for rocks and dirt to create ""spikes"" of land that will create many different levels in a very small space to keep the foliage you place on top of it looking varied and interesting.

Now, it's important to remember that, while this should look *random*, you should never abandon order completely. Maintain levels, and don't transition between them too rapidly. If you want huge height differences, use ""Levels"" up there. If you want to mix (say, chaotic at the bottom and a leveled style rising out of it to create a clearing in the middle/above a heavily forested section) go for it - the styles aren't mutually exclusive. Maintain the idea of levels in a broken-up way. You want different heights in the land without just having a bunch of flat, raise one square, flat, raise one square... etc. So we'll start with something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/tIAb8.jpg). Blocky, rough, just like the others. Then, start pulling corners and slowly abandoning the shape. Try to keep ""patterns"" from emerging. Avoid [bowls](http://i.imgur.com/elYnu.jpg) and [pyramids](http://i.imgur.com/3yKFH.jpg). The main purpose for this is, this landscaping style is intended to be covered completely with foliage, and all four trees on these (and probably surrounding) tiles will be the same height. Avoid too many tiles facing the exact same direction clumped together as well, as it will look sloppy. I didn't finish this example quite to the degree of the others, but I think [it gets the point across](http://i.imgur.com/uYwco.jpg).

All that's left is to [texture and cover it](http://i.imgur.com/qhP1g.jpg). I like to use different (but complimentary) land textures on this style of land. It's like an extra dimension to the foliage, since you can see bits of the land texture blended in behind the cracks in the trees.

So there you have it. Experiment, see what works, what fits the different situations you are creating in your parks, and what you enjoy creating. I'll be happy to answer any and all questions. It's been a long time since I wrote a guide for anything RCT, and I may be overlooking something.

Start by referencing real-life versions of the style you want to do. [The RollerCoaster DataBase](http://rcdb.com/) is a fantastic resource, and it helps to know a specific example (either a real-life ride or the company name, as you can search by either).


For instance, some good examples of popular coaster types are:

- [Nitro](http://i.imgur.com/dtjPU.jpg) (B&amp;M hyper coaster)(8~9 cars per train, 4 riders per car)

- [Goliath](http://i.imgur.com/dlsFE.jpg) (Giovanola hyper coaster)(5 cars per train, 6 riders per car)

- [Expedition GeForce](http://i.imgur.com/9QRTr.jpg) (Intamin hypercoaster)(6~7 cars per train, 4 riders per car)

- [Hydra](http://i.imgur.com/r9EXS.jpg) (B&amp;M floorless)(6~8 [usually 8] cars per train, 4 riders per car)

- [Apocalypse](http://i.imgur.com/aJpJx.jpg) (GCI wooden)(10~12 cars per train, 2 riders per car)

- [Comet](http://i.imgur.com/AK7pr.jpg)(PTC wooden)(4 cars per train, 6 riders per car)

- [Ghostrider](http://i.imgur.com/LdcmW.jpg)(CCI wooden)(6~7 cars per train, 4 riders per car)

- [Air](http://i.imgur.com/OEyNp.jpg) (B&amp;M flying)(7~8 cars per train, 4 riders per car)

*NOTE: To get eight cars on a flyer you HAVE to hack it with 4/8cars per Trainer. Also, the train length of flyers is a little exaggerated in-game, so you have a fair amount of leeway.*

Since you will probably want to incorporate block brakes, you should be sure to test your station to make sure it is as absolutely short as it can be whilst maintaining your desired train length. Using the above train lengths as guides, we can see this varies quite widely in the game:

- [B&amp;M 9-car hyper](http://i.imgur.com/Trsv7.jpg)

- [Giovanola 5-car hyper](http://i.imgur.com/O7UpY.jpg)

- [Intamin 8-car hyper](http://i.imgur.com/BDymL.jpg)

- [GCI 11-car wooden](http://i.imgur.com/CoUPK.jpg)

- [PTC 4-car wooden](http://i.imgur.com/Hw5b6.jpg)

- [CCI 6-car wooden](http://i.imgur.com/PUKoi.jpg)

- [B&amp;M 8-car flyer](http://i.imgur.com/I6X12.jpg)

Note the grid lengths of the segments.

Also note that the shorter the train, the lower the force disparity between front and back cars - but RCT does not care about this, except for velocity/momentum. G-Forces are taken from the front car. Train speed will be affected by train length - it's best to test with different lengths to see how your layout flows with each.


&gt;**2. Setting up the coaster, and block brakes**

I will cover brakes and the different other features that affect them in a later part of this tutorial, for now, we're focusing on the tiny space around the station.

When using block brakes, to conserve space, the first segment *behind* the station should **always** be a block brake. No need for spaces.

Very few roller coasters have a chain lift directly out of the station. Some notable examples are [Millennium Force](http://i.imgur.com/nmN3e.jpg) at Cedar Point and [Viper](http://i.imgur.com/3heKp.jpg) at Six Flags Magic Mountain; however, I could provide practically endless examples of rides with pre-lift sections.

[Here's Nitro again, being awesome](http://i.imgur.com/skH5r.jpg).

Examples are less important here. Just build your station 2~5 units off the ground and construct some kind of pre-lift section. It can be a drop, a turn, an inversion, or simply an s-bend, or any combination thereof.

&gt;**2.1 Lifts**

I've looked through a lot of rides, and one thing seems pretty universal. If a steel coaster has a pre-lift section, it has a brake run the length of one train immediately before the lift. See [Bizarro](http://i.imgur.com/x06Zf.jpg). Wooden coasters, however, do not. See [Timberhawk](http://i.imgur.com/wW1UJ.jpg) and [Mean Streak](http://i.imgur.com/gjlvt.jpg). Bare this in mind.

Keep your lifts realistic. That means not only straight (unless, as always, you have a VERY good reason to do otherwise, in which case use [this](http://i.imgur.com/ZHZRV.jpg) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/BZC9T.jpg) inclined method, depending on the length of your trains), but of reasonable height. Any woodie over 170ft is pushing it, especially considering the taller your lift hill becomes, the less realistic RCT's method of handling steep drops becomes.

Another thing to keep in mind is lift speeds; have a reason for what you set. Do not just leave it at 5mph because you are lazy. The taller a lift hill, the faster the lift should be. That does NOT mean hack a 20mph lift onto your 100ft woodie. I'mma smack you if I see that. But 6mph on a 220ft Intamin giga coaster is just as ridiculous.

&gt;**2.2 Cable lift hills**

Cable lift hills are rare but, thankfully, included in the game, yet they are only possible on Intamin incline track. You cannot have a pre-lift of any kind (including brakes) when using a cable lift hill. Now, I see people make steep lift hills when they use cable lifts quite often. I encourage you to look at the shaping of any lift hill, cable-powered or not, and reconsider doing so unless you have a strong reason for doing so. ""It looks cool"" doesn't count.

To create a cable lift hill, simply [build inclined track](http://i.imgur.com/hdA7H.jpg) (with or without ""chain lift"" selected - it doesn't matter) to *n*-1 units of your desired lift height. Then, insert a cable lift hill element from the drop-down menu. When you test the ride for the first time, [the cable track will fill itself in](http://i.imgur.com/pVHtl.jpg).

&gt;**2.3 Launches**

Very common, but not easy to do in RCTLL/RCT2. The easiest way is to build a (non-inclined, unlike the special element on certain B&amp;M track types) launch is hacking a ride's lift speed with 4/8cars per Trainer. Note that acceleration on lift hills is constant, so to achieve higher speeds you will need a longer launch track. Also note that crossing the lift track will play the lift sound unless you merge to another track type and have the chain lift there. I'll explain merging in a later part of this tutorial. To adjust lift speed, simply open the Rides -&gt; Edit Ride Stats dialog box, scroll down to your ride, enter the desired lift speed, and hit Apply or OK.

Familiarize yourself with how launch tracks are employed in real life.

- [Top Thrill Dragster](http://i.imgur.com/3WSlu.jpg)

- [Rita Queen of Speed](http://i.imgur.com/qtkiD.jpg)

- [Formula Rossa](http://i.imgur.com/lrD8U.jpg)

- [Mr. Freeze](http://i.imgur.com/vksVD.jpg)

- [Xcelerator](http://i.imgur.com/QcqNF.jpg)

If you wish for a launched train to return to the station backwards on a track with a hacked lift launch, note that the train must be travelling fast enough to break past the chain lift a second time, as it will accelerate the train in the same direction always (now *opposite* the train's direction of travel).

Whether you ""stage"" before your launch is up to you. This would include a full or near-full stop on a brake run before launching (outside the station). Some rides, ([like Maverick](http://cache.rcdb.com/j81ep522qm3fi000q0le5l.jpg)) have it - many ([like Speed](http://i.imgur.com/qsyCr.jpg)) do not. I think in most situations it is atmospheric to slow a train before its launch, a la [California Screamin'](http://i.imgur.com/aCyWR.jpg), but I understand that it is not the most common way to handle a launch.

[Etc]",jwilphl,68,2,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1j542v/if_rct4_was_ever_made_would_you_prefer_an/,"As a discussion point, would you prefer an ""eventual"" RCT4 to be more like 1 &amp; 2, utilizing the isometric viewpoint and traditional RTS-type graphics, or would you prefer them to improve upon the 3D foundation laid in RCT3 with something more realistic like NoLimits?

I ask because it seems people are split on the issue, and there are some rumors that Chris Sawyer may end up re-purchasing the RCT license from Atari (although I find it unlikely).  But if he did, I imagine he would go back to the isometric roots and simply improve upon it.

I'm torn, personally.  I've played a lot more RCT1/2 than 3, but with all the custom work, RCT3 really became a much better product and in many ways more realistic.  Plus there are good things there, like the peep differentiation and grouping and of course being able to explore your creations from a 1st-person level--and permanent zero-clearances.  You also have to think 3D is the new standard.

Ultimately I'd probably prefer the modernized RTS/isometric view with really crisp details, better construction tools, and more business aspects to park management (e.g. operating hotels and restaurants on property).",etc,False,,t5_2rzsl,False,,,True,t3_1j542v,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1j542v/if_rct4_was_ever_made_would_you_prefer_an/,

I've been playing this game since I was a kid. It was the first real computer game I played (I think I played like Frogger and a few other dumb games).  It was super challenging at first... I remember for a while I would borrow as much money as I could just to make Mischief, the big wooden roller coaster.

Then I realized the money aspect of the game, and it became much more appealing to me to play the scenarios and actually work my way through the entire game.  I did this a few times on my parent's computer, and when I got my own, the first thing I did was install roller coaster tycoon.

When I was playing the game as a kid, I could find some strategies online or whatever, as I got older at least and the internet was actually a thing. But mostly it was figuring out on my own how to make the most money.  I found strategies that worked the best, like avoiding food courts, and making the perfect length queue lines, and where to place rides in the park.

I've noticed now, after discovering this subreddit, that I seem to play the game differently from many people here.  I play for the scenarios.  I have rct2 and played that as a kid as well, but I never enjoyed it nearly as much.  Even after downloading the original rct scenarios, part of the joy was beating one so you could unlock another.  This aspect was gone in rct2 and made it much less rewarding to finish a scenario.

I never ever messed around with scenery.  I would put down a few things if I could, like some water scenery or mine scenery if i was building a mine coaster. Maybe I'd add some fences and flowers and trees to make it look nice.  But that was it.  I wouldn't make these elaborate structures and stuff like I see on here.

It just seems like a very different play style.  Most people who post here aren't bragging about what their final park value was upon completing a scenario, or how much money they made over x amount of years.  People show off the incredible amount of scenery they've added to make the perfect coaster.

I think it's really cool.  It's just different.  But I don't think I could ever play the game like that.  I reinstalled rct2 recently and I can't stand it.  It's too.... easy.  The challenge is still there, but if you want to make a scenario where money isn't an issue, you can do that and suddenly there is no challenge.  Sure you can create other challenges for yourself, as I imagine many of you do.

This is so long and I'm sorry for making you read it all if you didnt like it. But these are just my thoughts that I felt like throwing out there.

Anyone else here still play the business side of things?",Multi,False,,t5_2rzsl,False,mul,,True,t3_18buak,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/18buak/how_i_feel_rct_has_changed/,

---

As I understand it:

* Atari owns the rights to the name ""RollerCoaster Tycoon"". If a new game were to be made, this would be done by contacting Atari.

* Chris Sawyer owns the graphics, sound, and program code used in the games ""RollerCoaster Tycoon 1"" and ""RollerCoaster Tycoon 2"".

* Marjacq manages the games on behalf of Chris Sawyer.

Is this accurate?

---

I got this in response:

&gt;No. Chris Sayer owns *all* rights including registered trademarks in the name and copyright in content. Atari has an exclusive licence from Chris Sawyer. Atari (and its successors to the licence) are the only people entitled to make new games or approve their development (in accordance with that licence). Marjacq manages Chris Sawyer's rights.

---

What does this mean?

* Chris Sawyer owns the games RCT1 and RCT2.

* Chris Sawyer owns the name RollerCoaster Tycoon (the trademark)

* Atari licenses the trademark for ""RollerCoaster Tycoon"" from Chris Sawyer.

* The **only** company licensed to sell the games RCT1, RCT2, or RCT3 is Atari. Proof: [Atari is the publisher on GOG.com](http://www.gog.com/gamecard/rollercoaster_tycoon_2) and elsewhere. I can't find anywhere that doesn't list Atari as the publisher. I.e., only Atari can sell RCT1, RCT2, or RCT3.

---

My speculation:

* Atari holds an exclusive license to sell RCT1, RCT2, RCT3. Even if you asked Chris Sawyer for a license to his trademark and game code, you would have to talk to Atari. The contract doesn't allow for any other company to make RCT games.

* Atari / Frontier Developments owns the copyright to the game code, graphics, music etc. for RCT3.

* The auction (starting bid $3.5 million) will be for the rights to this contract. Thus, the new owner could:

 * License the games to GOG, Steam, Amazon, etc.
 * Create new games in the RCT franchise (maybe with a fee to Chris Sawyer for each new game?)

* Chris Sawyer may want to buy back the rights for his game. He could probably afford it.",Etc.,False,,t5_2rzsl,False,etc,,True,t3_1ez8ex,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1ez8ex/i_contacted_chris_sawyers_agency_marjacq/,

So I think It works out to more like 5 or 6 years it was played on and off. But this was one of my very first parks that I started 10 years ago. I now have flattened all of the dunes, I have completely ripped the park down and rebuilt it at least 3 times, I currently have $2.3 million, and I'm in my 104th year. 

In all honesty, I don't know if this is impressive in the least. My coasters aren't nearly as great as the ones posted here. But I figured I would post it here and see if there would be any interest.

But back to the topic. I usually make the exit a bit of a longer path with a ""no entry"" sign at the end of it to keep people from wandering back up the exit area.  I then stick a balloon stall right at the exit and change the color to match the coaster.  I find it nice to be able to see people wandering my parks with different colored balloons that they can only get by going on a certain coaster.  I even sometimes do it when I have themed areas to easily see how the traffic flows through the park.

Note: I deliberately left out RCT2-only track elements so users of both games can take advantage of this guide. Banked curving drops add to excitement, but they're not in the original game, hence why I didn't include them here.

------

This is a guide to creating an exciting roller coaster - the main goal of the game. This post *only* covers the basics; feel free to add on to this guide in the comments below.

------

Step One - [Here](http://i.imgur.com/0jfCU.png) we have a basic Steel Roller Coaster platform. Make the platform as long as you can (if you're using RCT1) - the added capacity is worth the extra space.

Step Two - [Bigger isn't always better!](http://i.imgur.com/MA2J5.png) If you build too tall, then you will have trouble creating additional elements. In general, try to keep the height to double-digits (for RCT2) and below 20 (for RCT1).

Step Three - [A curving drop](http://i.imgur.com/k9Q7B.png) is generally more exciting than a straight one.

Step Four - [Inversions](http://i.imgur.com/SsC6V.png) add to your excitement rating, but only when taken at a reasonable speed. Since the Steel Roller Coaster includes an inversion, let's add one!

Step Five - Guests love [airtime](http://i.imgur.com/kEsxF.png), or ""Negative-G"". Along with inversions, make sure the hills are taken at a reasonable speed - otherwise the negative-g will skyrocket and your intensity rating will shoot through the roof.

Step Six - [Twisty bits](http://i.imgur.com/o1HLl.png) add to excitement but also adds to your nausea rating, which you want to keep as low as possible. To do this, make sure it is taken at a reasonable speed (yet again).

Step Seven - [Helices](http://i.imgur.com/ldjgb.png) can be valuable, but only when - you got it - taken at a reasonable speed. If they're taken too fast, not only will the nausea rating skyrocket, but your positive G rating as well. Unlike negative G, it's advisable to always aim for a lower positive G rating.

Uh-oh. Those curves at the tail end of the helix do not look good. As a general rule, stay away from the smallest curves unless your train is traveling somewhat slow. Let's fix this.

Step Eight - A [wider radius curve](http://i.imgur.com/55Gvu.png) will bring down the positive G rating, as well as intensity and nausea.

Step Nine - An [on-ride photo section](http://i.imgur.com/pBt1I.png) boosts excitement, and also provides a new stream of revenue.

Step Ten - It's time to start returning to the station. [Wide curves!](http://i.imgur.com/IugaP.png)

Step Eleven - Don't forget [the brakes](http://i.imgur.com/lAwgU.png). In RCT1, it's crucial to have a couple of units of brakes - set to 13 or 9 MPH - to avoid a disastrous crash in case of a ***station brakes failure*** (insert ominous thunderclap). In RCT2, where block brakes were introduced, this becomes a smaller problem.

Step Twelve - Place [the entrance](http://i.imgur.com/MNdVg.png) about midway between the train about to be loaded. This cuts down on loading time and increases efficiency.



It's pretty much done - [let's test](http://i.imgur.com/sXU1a.png) and see how it works!

[The stats:](http://i.imgur.com/Jtvev.png) 5.69 excitement (high), 6.56 intensity (high), and 2.98 nausea (medium).

Very respectable for a roller coaster that (literally) took five minutes to finish! Also, this is a pretty short coaster - as a general rule of thumb, longer coaster = higher excitement. Ideally, the excitement should be higher than the intensity, which should be higher than nausea (E&gt;I&gt;N). 

But we're not finished - there are several ways in which we can crank up the excitement just a little bit. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/sLQiD.png), we've added some paths crossing over the coaster, as well as some trees close to the track.

Now, the excitement rating is up to 5.83. There are other ways to increase the excitement; underground sections, track over water, and interaction with more scenery can all help boost the excitement rating.

It's been fun, but I was quickly reminded of one of my little pet peeves of the game... the constant FLUSH... FLUSH... FLUSH... of the toilets. In a busy park, I find it can be quite distracting and annoying, and overpowers the other sound effects. But maybe it's just me.

In any case, I decided to spend a little time (when I should have been working) poking around and trying to find a way to shut them up once and for all. I finally figured it out, and just in case there's anyone else out there who's sick of all the flushing, I thought I'd share it. It's just a drop-in replacement for the built-in sound effects file.

**[RCT2 Toilet Silencer](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/55308909/RCT_Toilet_Silencer.zip)**

I'm running the original RCT2; I have no idea what will happen if you try to install this over one of the add-on packs. If you do try it, be sure to back up the original file first.

-----

For those who prefer to do things themselves, or if there's some other sound you'd like to mute (barfing, perhaps?), or for the merely curious, here's a little step-by-step **(you don't have to do any of this crap if you download the above file)**:

1. You will need a hex editor, and some level of comfort with editing binary files. If you don't know what ""hex"" means, don't even bother reading the rest of this.
2. The sound effects are in {RCT installation dir}/Data/css1.dat. Make a backup copy of this file, then open the original in your hex editor.
3. Read over [this page describing the format of css1.dat](http://www.strategyplanet.com/rctuk/tid/css1dat.html). It's actually for RCT1, but the file format doesn't appear to have changed... although some new sounds may have been added. It's a little unclear on the page, but the ""DataSize"" dword and the wav header struct are repeated for each sound effect.
4. On the list in the above page, find the sound you want to shut up. For example, the toilet flush is the 37th sound on the list, so we want the 37th dword in the OffsetList. This is located at offset 4 * 37 = 148 in the file.
5. The 4 bytes starting at byte 148 (or whatever you calculated for your least favourite sound) give the offset to the actual sound data. For the toilet, it's ""20 C4 31 00"". Depending on how your hex editor works, you may need to convert this to big-endian hex (31C420) or decimal (3261472) to jump to the appropriate offset.
6. The 4 bytes starting at the offset you found in step 5 contain the length of the sound data for the particular effect you want to kill. Before you change anything, take a look ahead at the *following* bytes and make sure they represent the standard(ish) wav header format described in the document. That is, starting at your offset + 4, you should see ""01 00 01 00 22 56 00 00 44 AC 00 00 02 00 10 00"".
7. If you're good and confident that you've found the right place, change the 4 bytes representing the DataSize to zero (""00 00 00 00""). Now when the game goes to play that sound, it will see its data length as zero, and not load anything. Ah, the sweet sound of silence!

1374965903.0,46,self.rct,1j6pi7,Guide to Realistic River Rapids.,inthemanual,49,3,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1j6pi7/guide_to_realistic_river_rapids/,"[Step 1:](http://i.imgur.com/ceoe8L6.png)
Start with a rapids ride with two stations: Station 1 below ground, and with a full circuit, and Station 2 above ground where you want guests to board. Station 1's length determines how many boats the ride can hold, so be sure to adjust that accordingly. Also make sure that Station 1's loop has at least 1 straight flat piece. 

[Step 2:](http://i.imgur.com/oQHOpUd.png)
build the station of the type of guide track that you want leading up to a straight piece in the Station 1 loop, BUT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. Delete any of the rapids track that gets in your way, and rebuild it later with Zero Clearances. Then build a single flat straight piece where the rapids track straight piece was, and start a climb to the surface. Now you can build the rapids track back where it was after applying ZC. The overlapping straight piece will cause the boats to change track, and in order to do that, the rapids track has to be built last. 

[Step 3:](http://i.imgur.com/sFDKWqx.png) 
Build your station. Most Rapids stations are round, and to do that, follow what I did, by using 2 3x3 turns followed by a 2 unit station. The 3x3 turns allow you to fit the 2x2 and 4x4 wooden platforms around the track. You **do not** need to add entrances and exits to the guide track. Keep in mind during this step that the boats will be 5ft/1.5m/1u above ground level, which will be where water will be raised to later.

[Step 4:](http://i.imgur.com/LDs0ZXc.png) 
Build almost all of the circuit for the guide track. The longer this is, the safer this hack will be. This is because you will have to mend the gap while the boats are moving on the track and if they approach the end, they can crash. 

[Step 5:](http://i.imgur.com/BWiQvxd.png)
Open the rapids ride. The boats will leave the station like normal, go towards the guide track, and after they've crossed the shared tile, they will switch directions and go along the guide track. [You can mend the gap as soon as every boat has passed by any part you'd be constructing on.](http://i.imgur.com/6G57PMS.png)

[Step 6:](http://i.imgur.com/yReqStc.png)
Make it look pretty. Add waterfalls, rapids, and lifts to make it as much alike a real rapids ride as you can. Also be sure to use the Geewhzz hack to make the above ground rapids station invisible. Theme the station how you wish, and add foliage and other decorations to add to the scene (not pictured).

The objective is to get 2000 guests, but that isn't the whole idea of this challenge, it would be cool if everyone could post some screenshots so we can all check out the different ways people decide to expand and grow this park.

No cheats or trainers were used, and all rides and scenery were built using my own money that I earned (I didn't hack in any money). I also used all vanilla rides and scenery (which may seem odd on this subreddit since most here use custom objects), so if you download it, know that this is as much as I could do with the base game. I am waiting until I get bored with the vanilla game until I start experimenting with custom objects. And the buildings and scenery are not supposed to be realistic; you can take a look at the urban area to see that. It looks like a fun and fantastical park to me, even if it is unrealistic. But I've rambled on too much here. Enjoy :)

Anyway, this is probably my best park, at least among the standard scenarios. It's from the Evergreen Gardens scenario on RCT1, with no cheats/trainers used.

Some highlights:

--3,200+ guests

--101 rides &amp; attractions

--11 Rollercoasters with at least a 7.24 excitement rating

And perhaps my best creation: Black and White - Dueling Steel Coasters with 9.42 / 9.21 excitement ratings

Let me know what you think! If there's any interest I'd certainly make it available for download.

It even still has my [old terrible rollercoaster](http://rctexchange.atari.com/exchange/rct1/item?id=17727) that I used to put in all of my parks back in 2003.

I don't know if it is still maintained, but it is obviously still here. It doesn't receive many uploads anymore, but perhaps sending some traffic its way will raise a few eyebrows from Atari?

Even so, it is still a great place to find ride designs for those of you who have been looking for a ride exchange website. And since I couldn't find one while searching the subreddit, or in the subreddit description, I feel the need to point it out to you guys. Have fun.

[http://rctexchange.atari.com/](http://rctexchange.atari.com/exchange/)

I am downloading all of the rides from the website and am uploading them to Mediafire. Most of the RCT1 rides are anywhere between 30 bytes to a couple kilobytes, but there are 24k+ of them. RCT2 even more. Below are the download links. Compressing them helped tremendously. They may seem small, but once you unzip them... well RCT1 is over 100mB uncompressed

Well, a bench is a save file, created by a player, for the purpose of collecting multiple custom scenery objects, as well as custom rides into one park, so that you would not have to load them in yourself. Benches also act as a sort of ""sandbox"" as most of them come with blank landscapes, for you to build your own creation. Benches are particularly helpful when you want a blank canvas with lots of good scenery and rides to work with!

**TLDR:** A workbench is blank canvas with big collections of custom objects, helpful for building parks.

So, where can you find these ""workbenches""? THe best place to find some are in the New Element Exchange, found [here.](http://www.nedesigns.com/forum/50/custom-scenery-exchange/)Some ones I recommend are the 2012 one by Louis!, or if you can find it, the Xtreme97 bench. Anyways, thought this could be helpful to some. Happy building :)

I have a cousin with severe autism.  His favorite game (really the only game he plays) is Roller Coaster Tycoon.  He has all 3 games and all the expansions and plays them every single day.

I found out today that he has been hung up on a [screenshot of a Disney castle](http://i.imgur.com/jpgGDWt.jpg) for YEARS.  He has been asking his parents to play with this park for years.  They assumed it was an expansion that was impossible to find or whose production was halted by Disney so my cousin was just out of luck.  

Well, today is my cousin's 18th birthday and he asked his dad for this park again.  My uncle asked me if I could look into it and I stumbled accross [this site](https://sites.google.com/site/ohiolandshark/).  The owner of the site says that his parks have been lost forever, but if anyone happened to download it or has some form of park with a castle like the one that my cousin has been obsessing over for years and you could somehow get it to me you'd make his birthday one to remember.

Thanks for reading.

As such, my examples will be a little less useful, since they a) have no context and b) consist of elements that I personally favor. There are a lot of trees in the game I don't like, but depending on the situation, they're perfectly usable (ex: Monkey-Puzzle Tree).

&gt;**The Palette**


Either before you even touch a section, or after all the rides and buildings are done, you need to think about how you want the foliage to look. Your assortment of trees should carry the surrounding buildings, rides, landscaping, themes, and play it all back tenfold. Palm trees should not cover ski resorts, and magnolia trees should never be used anywhere ever. Ever.

... Okay, that's a little unfair. See above. But the point stands. The challenge in this step comes from picking not just one tree that looks good and makes your point/ties the theme together, but finding *many* that all do that job *as well* as look good together. This should be an absolute minimum of four different full-tile trees, and an absolute maximum of seven, to prevent it looking too repetitive or too messy. Ideally you should add one quarter-tile tree to vary the size just a little more - what you choose should depend on the others, and you shouldn't start placing it until the full tile trees are placed and you're good with their positions, for reasons I'll explain later.

Here are some examples of palettes I threw together:

- [1](http://i.imgur.com/uztDQ.jpg)

- [2](http://i.imgur.com/3i7t8.jpg)

- [3](http://i.imgur.com/dJEQa.jpg)

- [4](http://i.imgur.com/GVwXW.jpg)

- [5](http://i.imgur.com/esVS8.jpg)

- [6](http://i.imgur.com/5FslW.jpg)

- [7](http://i.imgur.com/cGuhb.jpg)

Note how even the ground texture plays a role in the feel of the foliage, owing to the colors involved. If some of these look familiar, it's probably because I've used them before in some screenshot I showed here. As I said, I use what I like, and palettes that work for you will probably include trees I didn't use at all. What's important to keep in mind is the colors. You must strike a balance between randomness and monotone in color, where you vary it just enough to make it interesting, but keep a set, predominant shade to give the overall look cohesiveness. Further accents can come from flowers, although I generally use those to carry colored details from buildings across forested areas, to tie the look of the wilderness back into the structures I've made. That sounds complicated, but it's just a guess-and-check game to see what works, playing with the colors of the flowers versus the colors on your buildings.

&gt;**Sizes**


You can break down the trees into one of three subsets: short, average, and tall (I know - complicated, right?). It's important to include trees from at least two of these groups for the same reason you don't want too much of one color. Varied land heights beneath the trees will help break up the skyline, but especially for short trees, landscaping is not very easily hidden and thus creating a natural look becomes a problem. Aim for 1-3-1 or 2-3-1 or something similar (for short - average - tall) for a good, solid approach. The more you master the concept, the more you can break the ""rules"" and experiment.

[This is a small handful of trees from the base set](http://i.imgur.com/dvodF.jpg). You can see just how big the height differential can be, and there are a bunch that I didn't get. The jungle set trees are average to tall, while the creepy set trees tend to be short to average. The differences are all really relative to the other trees in the set, so it's not like you have to say ""Okay. I have a tall Cedar of Lebanon and a short Palm Tree. Now I have to make them work"". Focus on colors first. Sometimes even the [color of surrounding rides can fill in for those](http://i.imgur.com/NNJtm.jpg) you're leaving out of the palette for contextual reasons.

&gt;**Underbrush**


This is where you hammer the point home. It also is least important to ""get right"", but is perhaps the most time consuming. Generally, you want to clump your foliage together. If you're going to make a forest, it should be dense, but in amusement parks, usually you will have small patches of trees interspersed amongst the rides, shops, and path. The underbrush beneath them should creep out and cover the ground around in a feathering effect. Which objects you pick for your underbrush are almost entirely personal preference. You have the seven shrubs/bushes from the base set, the six from the jungle set, and three ornamental trees from the base set to work with (I'm not counting the stupid squirrel and ball and pyramid or whatever, I'm talking about the three semi-natural-looking quarter-tile tree objects at the top of the window). Pick three to five, depending on what you think fits, turn on zero-clearance, and go to town.

This is why you should want until this point to place any quarter-tile trees - when in zero-clearance mode, it's usually beneficial to just turn off scenery and place your shrubs on all the tiles where your trees are. I personally use ground texture codes so I know not to build inside a building or on spaces reserved/already being used for other purposes. If you place a shrub on top of a quarter-tile tree by accident, it's not the end of the world, but it can look bad, and you might as well do everything you can to maximize the attractiveness of what you're creating. [You should get a nice, full look](http://i.imgur.com/6aUcy.jpg) for areas where foliage should look thick. [In more sparse areas, more sparse underbrush is appropriate](http://i.imgur.com/IMWjd.jpg). [Sometimes it's best to just emulate the colors of the trees](http://i.imgur.com/IXSVE.jpg). It's all up to you. Take care also to not carelessly place shrubs under ride supports. The supports, especially on wooden coasters, can draw attention to itself and look sloppy. Again, easy to avoid.

&gt;**CSO Foliage**


The thing about most CSO benches nowadays is they have a custom set of trees created to save space in the ""small objects"" tab, freeing it up for other things like architecture blocks and supports. These custom trees have become colorable, and open up a ton of new arrangement possibilities, as you can have nearly any shade with nearly any kind of tree. Certain colors will look better with certain kinds of trees, but modifying the [color of the trunks](http://i.imgur.com/gLzlH.jpg) specifically can help darken or lighten an overall color scheme. Sometimes [the changes are subtle and confined to just one or two types of tree](http://i.imgur.com/lfRyB.jpg). It's up to you. Take the same basic principles of size, color, and whatnot, and add the dimension of custom color. [Even the bushes and smaller stuff can be colorable](http://i.imgur.com/yjOLo.jpg), which means you can repeat the same object more times without it looking like crap.

And, you can always just fall back and use the original colors. Sometimes it takes some fiddling to reach the original shade, but I'm quite certain it's possible for all of them. Just takes a little more time.",Multi,False,,t5_2rzsl,True,mul,,True,t3_te07k,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/te07k/valdairs_guide_to_stuff_part_2_foliage/,

&gt;**3. Heights**

The pacing of a ride is EXTREMELY important, and good pacing does not mean going fast all the time, even for your big E-ticket stuff. Good pacing results from a pleasant mix of speeds, alternating between exciting and relaxing parts (relative of course). A good pre-lift plays into this quite easily, hopefully showing off the scenery while moving just a bit faster than the journey up the lift hill will be. There are technical reasons for these pre-lifts (such as how disengaging from the station works), but RCT doesn't care about them.

It's important to note that good pacing does **NOT** result from a bunch of chain lifts and brakes. That is a cheap way of controlling speed, it shows no skill (on the contrary, it displays a lack of it), and it is boring to watch. Good pacing is achieved through managing element heights properly. Gravity and friction is all you need. If you want to build something like [Beast](http://i.imgur.com/H8KMZ.jpg), go for it - just understand *why* Beast is the way it is, and make it have a purpose. Also, keep it rare. If everyone tries to do the ""exceptions"" to the rules, it really ruins it.

Usually a good rule to go by is the unofficial law of fours - on average, it's a good idea to have each hill four units lower than the previous (same goes for elements). However, due to friction acting for a longer time over larger segments, it's a good idea to make the first hills following the lift or launch 6~8 units (30~40ft) lower than the lift itself, shortening the gap to about per as you approach the MCBR (or just halfway through the ride, if you don't have an MCBR), and continuing down as the ride ends, where you can usually have several hills of very similar height to finish the ride off.

&gt;**3.1 Air time**

Air time plays a large role in the pacing of your design. Carefully balancing speed and the shape of your hills to produce ideal negative vertical G-forces is huge. On coaster styles with the large steep-to-level piece, you can create a low, but fast hill with more sustained air time. More pointed hills will produce more pointed spikes in negative vertical G's.

It's worth noting that, in the choice between normal and large hill crests/valleys, you can use the ""normal"" method to get three units (15ft) lower than a large piece, with the same number of steep hill segments - [like so](http://i.imgur.com/mYRDD.jpg).

If you're going to mix the two methods on the same whole, the wide pitch change should always be at the BOTTOM of the hill - if it's at the top with a ""normal"" transition at the bottom, [it will just look horribly lopsided](http://i.imgur.com/RSQfU.jpg). Also, the spike in forces you are creating makes no sense to have, as it is so avoidable.

&gt;**3.2 MCBRs**

MCBR stands for Mid-Course Brake Run, and it usually contains the division between the two main blocks on a standard coaster. Whether or not you incorporate one should depend on the size of your ride.

The longer your ride is, the more likely it is you will need an MCBR. Even launched coasters can use them; the subsequent train will just hold at the station or previous block brake instead of the top of the lift until the MCBR block is cleared.

Your MCBR should be about the length of a train. If a train has to stop here, the back should not be stuck hanging over an edge, in a turn, or in the middle of an inversion. Including a catwalk and steps is something you should consider, but how you execute it is something you have to experiment with on your own (probably with CSO - NCSO RCT2 does not really have anything that works, and in RCTLL this is generally accomplished with trackitecture). Note that the block brake will try to slow the train to 4mph. You can circumvent this by having a train approach above a certain speed, [and having no (acting) brakes before it](http://i.imgur.com/vqrev.jpg). The train will slow, but not as much. That said, your train **MUST** still be able to clear the latter half of the track from 4mph, in case it does break down and the train is stopped here. Going by the law of fours immediately after an MCBR is a good idea.

You can also have an MCBR that is not a block brake, and if your ride is long enough (and you aren't using block sections), it should. Not only is it realistic, it can act as speed control. A stretch of 22mph brakes acting on a train entering a 30+ is just enough to make sure shorter elements of the latter half of the ride are not taken at too high of speeds. Guests will speed up the trains, and the further into the course the train gets, the greater the disparity between tested and actual speeds/forces becomes.

&gt;**3.3 Order of elements and inversions**

How you manage your major inversions affects speed just as much as how you manage your hills. Again, some real-life examples will do more than my explications can. See:

- [Scream!](http://i.imgur.com/QsyGt.jpg)

- [Great American Scream Machine](http://i.imgur.com/DCqNp.jpg)

- [Batman: The Ride](http://i.imgur.com/cvlTw.jpg)

- [Nemesis](http://i.imgur.com/1yxob.jpg)

- [Stormrunner](http://i.imgur.com/fn1WX.jpg)

On rides with elements like large loops and vertical track + quarter loops, the taller elements should always come first, and diminish into the smaller ones as the train loses speed. If you wanted to have a large vertical loop -&gt; dive loop/immleman -&gt; cobra roll setup, however, you should note that this will create four equal-height inversions. So unless you want that first loop to be way too forceful, or the cobra roll far too slow, you've got to make some modifications. If the starting height of the cobra roll is 0ft (6 units), the top would be 85ft (22 units), so we'll use that as our ""minimum"". The previous elements should be higher.

So we want our dive loop to be 95~100ft (24~25 units), and our vertical loop to be 105~110ft (26~27 units). Play with different values to find a pace you like. This can be accomplished by not having as large of a first drop (not all the way to flat land), or by having inclined track up several feet/units to raise the base of the element.

Dive loops/immlemans can be accomplished one of three ways (only two in RCTLL):

- [Vertical track](http://i.imgur.com/SBBpi.jpg)

- [Steep track + barrel roll](http://i.imgur.com/GJdhR.jpg)

- [Steep track + corkscrew](http://i.imgur.com/A0zei.jpg)

*Note: Creating the vertical twist version of the dive loop or immleman is much higher than the other two, and you should adjust the heights of your other elements accordingly. You can also bury the entry/exit if you need to. Just remember to always keep the speed of the train in your mind. Eventually you will develop an intuition for about how fast the train will be going at any given point in your layout.*

The shaping of your elements does matter. The realistic reasons for this are complex, but in general you should follow these rules unless you have a specific contextual reason to break them, such as fitting in path, buildings, or other rides. But try to give the roller coaster precedence.

Bolliger &amp; Mabillard have done just about every element in the book somewhere (with notable exceptions such as the Norwegian Loop, but that's for you to explore), so their executions are good reference for why elements are the way they are, and what we as designers should try to emulate.

- [Cobra roll](http://i.imgur.com/QSATv.jpg): Almost always V-shaped. In RCT this is accomplished via two mirrored large half-loops linked by two half-cokscrews, with one or more straight segments added between for realistic spacing. See [this example](http://i.imgur.com/bbDt8.jpg). This is one of those times that the shaping can, if necessary, be flexed a little to accommodate something else.

- [Immleman/Dive loop](http://i.imgur.com/f5zfp.jpg): Same element, reverse direction. Kraken's dive loop is a perfect example of how and why B&amp;M uses them (I wish I could have found a better picture, but I think it still gets the point across). The train can change direction at high speed, resulting in a practically nonexistent footprint. But you can see the roll never *quite* hits 180° upside-down. You will see this everywhere, even on inverts and other coaster manufacturers' rides. You accomplish this look in RCT with the barrel roll or corkscrew (see previous examples) rotating the same direction as the large half-loop. Right-twisting barrel roll = right large half-loop. Left-twisting corkscrew = left large half-loop. It's small effort for good visual payoff.

- [Corkscrews and barrel rolls/zero-G rolls](http://i.imgur.com/JDjKr.jpg): We don't have much control over our rolls, but it's still important to not be careless about them. Rolls should complete their turns, not go 0-180-0 (in the case of barrel rolls) or double back (in the case of corkscrews). In very specific and rare cases, a corkscrew has doubled back on itself in a real design (see [Drachen Fire](http://i.imgur.com/2OB1m.jpg), now sadly defunct), but again, this is one of those you want to have a VERY good reason for so it does not become overused.

As a final note, because it is something I have seen rather often: barrel rolls should not be at the bottom of hills, particularly high speed ones. Not only does this not exist in real life, it makes no sense to put something so forceful at a point where the train would be moving its fastest. This includes immediately following larger inversions like loops and even corkscrews. It goes back to the height of hills - treat barrel rolls as a part of hill crests, and plan the speed around them accordingly. Your would-be riders will thank you for it.",Multi,False,,t5_2rzsl,False,mul,,True,t3_u57ie,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/u57ie/valdairs_guide_to_stuff_part_3_roller_coaster/,

So we can post screenshots and comment on the development of each others parks and get ideas for our own :D


I decided to make my own scenario for this, it is a small map so it shouldn't take long to fill out, meaning you don't have to devote a huge amount of time to this. Difficulty isn't too hard, just enough money to have a natural growth in your park, which makes it more enjoyable in my experience. Research is set up so you get the bigger rollercoaster rides later on, meaning your park can have more natural progression.

So if anybody wants to play, then download and join us (2 friends of mine started on this just now). There aren't any rules (if there is something nagging that you don't like, feel free to load it up in scenario editor and chagne whatever you like!) and this isn't really a competition, so don't worry if you aren't a brilliant coaster/scenery designer, this is just about seeing how each person decides to populate their park.

[2],64fanatic,34,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1h93gx/more_exact_recreations_of_rct1_scenarios_for_rct2/,"A a nice heads up, there is a much better RCT1 scenarios pack made by a fellow on /vr/:

http://www.mediafire.com/download/3cw47sd2wt3hues/ExactRCT1Recreations.zip

""This pack of scenarios is an attempt to remake all of the scenarios from RCT1 for RCT2 as accurately as possible, right down to the research order and staff uniform colors, and without using any Wacky Worlds, Time Twister, or custom scenery. Other users such as dakinle and RCTScenarioLover did a good job making their own while including some RCT2 extras into the mix, but I felt that this took away the good old ""feel"" of the original scenarios and decided to redo the build menus and research trees as exact as possible to the originals (with some exceptions, listed in the details in the readme), courtesy of rcthelp's Reaserch Trees on RCT Station. I think that this maintains the nostalgic feel and, for some scenarios, the challenge. All parks were re-categorized so that the Original RCTs are under Beginner, Corkscrew Follies under Challenging, and Loopy Landscapes under Expert. Rainbow Valley isn't exactly a beginner park, but it best resembles RCT1's categorization.""

About a year ago I posted a [guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/t2dui/the_quick_easy_guide_to_creating_an_exciting/) to building a basic, exciting roller coaster that guests will actually ride. I felt that the guide was lacking in some respects, plus it was somewhat outdated, so here's a brand-spanking-new edition!

--------------

**Note:** this is a *very basic* guide to building a roller coaster for the purpose of beating a scenario. If you're looking for a building guide covering the more advanced options -- including hacking, use of trainers, and more obscure roller coaster types -- the [sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/wiki/index) provides a wealth of information.

Let's get started!

-----------------------

1. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/5UUDUuo.jpg) we have a basic twister roller coaster. It's very versatile and easy to build, so let's use this one! Keep in mind the size of the train when building a station platform. Some roller coasters will have very 'large' cars with relatively small capacity, so in that case, it's advisable to build long stations. For our coaster, though, the train packs a lot of capacity into a smaller size thanks to its four-across seating, so we'll be fine with a smaller one.

2. [Generally speaking,](http://i.imgur.com/xBowXhx.jpg) it's a bad idea to build *too* tall just as much as it is a problem to build too short. A too-tall roller coaster will create speeds that are hard to deal with and you'll encounter problems with pacing and proper speed required for negotiating elements. ~100 feet is pretty much the sweet spot.

3. [A curving drop](http://i.imgur.com/N8bHp3s.jpg) gets higher excitement ratings than a straight drop, as a rule of thumb. Don't forget to bank, though! Unbanked drops - especially at higher speeds - will generate uncomfortable amounts of lateral G.

4. [Some roller coasters](http://i.imgur.com/L0GnaoN.jpg) have a special element (that you can access from the drop-down menu) which gives you a wider-radius pull-out. It's very helpful in this situation, since the train is going very fast and pulling out of the drop too rapidly will lead to higher positive Gs.

5. [Loops are fun,](http://i.imgur.com/8IIMldC.jpg) so let's add one ... but wait. Notice the height markers: the top of the loop is nearly equal to the highest point on the coaster. This tells me the train might not make it over; better to play it safe.

6. [We'll need to burn some speed](http://i.imgur.com/LJkK3Ua.jpg) before we can use the smaller loops, so let's add some hills. Airtime hills provide negative Gs -- otherwise known as 'butterflies in your stomach' -- and add excitement. Don't take them too fast though, since *too* much negative G can also be a bad thing.

7. [Burning some more speed.](http://i.imgur.com/BHUV9uu.jpg) Remember to bank the curves, as usual. It's also a good idea -- although not a hard and fast rule -- to have each of your hills shorter than the one preceding it. This ensures that the train will have enough momentum to finish the circuit.

8. [Now we can go wild!](http://i.imgur.com/BrLUDk7.jpg) The twister coaster comes with a veritable laundry list of special elements. Feel free to experiment, although moderation is, as usual, the key. Too much elements in too small a space, or taken at a too-high speed, will result in a very intense and nauseating coaster. 

9. [Block brakes,](http://i.imgur.com/X5GLRZ7.jpg) in real life, allow more than one train to operate on the same track and prevent accidents by sensing where a train is. If a train gets stuck, the block brakes spring into action, holding the next train safely at the brakes to prevent a collision. In Roller Coaster Tycoon, you can disable block brakes by going into a roller coaster's settings tab. If you choose to do so, the length of the station will dictate how many trains can run on the circuit at one time.

 Important: the remainder of the circuit following the block brakes *must not go above the height of the brakes!* Since trains can potentially come to a full halt, it must have enough energy coming out of the brakes to go through the rest of the track.

10. [Following the blocks,](http://i.imgur.com/SIdknPj.jpg) now's a good time to throw in not-so-tall elements like the corkscrew or the barrel roll, which can -- and should -- be executed with less speed than other, more demanding elements. 

11. [A helix](http://i.imgur.com/AftCDW3.jpg) adds ride duration, provides lateral Gs, and is a good way to burn some speed (when going upwards). Be careful though, since high speeds can be absolute killer for helices (and turns in general).

 Sorry, the photo got screwed up a little here...

12. [An on-ride photo section and a bunny hill](http://i.imgur.com/GoPZFws.jpg) also contribute to our excitement rating, and it's time to head back to the station. 

13. [A set of blocks right before the station](http://i.imgur.com/PsAPuU8.jpg) is a good idea, since a train coming into the station will stop just before the station, providing a steady flow of new riders.

14. [Let's test](http://i.imgur.com/rwSGJjB.jpg) and see if it works! Note the train sitting on the block brake in the corner, ready to leave once the next train clears its block section.

15. [The ratings](http://i.imgur.com/2XR7Rn6.jpg) -- not bad! Ideally, the excitement should be higher than the intensity, which should be higher than the nausea (E &gt; I &gt; N). But this will do for now. 

 We're not done, though -- we can push that excitement rating up just a smidgen higher.

16. [And here's how!](http://i.imgur.com/fws5A8X.jpg) Trees, water, path interaction, and custom architecture surround your coaster can boost your E rating by a few points. 

 Give your coaster a wicked cool name and a coat of paint, and you're off and away.

""Catalyst"" is a coaster that occupies the entire sandbox. It's post-apocalyptic themed and zigzags through city ruins, dead forests, and armies of machine invaders. I am very proud of this one, especially with the post-production towards the end. I used several support and ride add-on packs that were found on the late [vodhin.org](http://www.vodhin.org) website.

""Snow Queen"" takes place at a secret military cosmonaut-training base in Siberia, mainly above the central tower (5 towers total, connected by monorail). There's another coaster behind the towers, though it's not as nice as Catalyst. I used some of the custom fireworks from the vPyro Pack 12, as well as some of the built-in ones that I had modified myself. I also made all the lasers.

I personally designed the structures and landscapes in both videos using mostly in-game content.

When you go fast you get pushed back into the seat, when you're going fast on a corner you get thrown to the side, and when you go over a hill you feel lighter. That's cause you are acting against the force of gravity - G-Forces are being produced. 1 G = Earth's gravity. G-Forces are at the heart of intensity and nausea ratings. There are two types: lateral Gs and vertical Gs. (a third, linear, is not taken into account in RCT and is the affect of acceleration (for an example look at kingda ka)). Lateral Gs are from fast corners or any spec. elements that involve turns like corkscrews. Vertical Gs are from peaks, valleys, and elements that involve height changes like loops. The key to making coasters that are survivable are mitigating these G-forces. The key to making coasters that are profitable are harnessing these G-forces.

Lateral Gs are the harshest kind, guests absolutely hate lats above 2 or below 2. (don't have figures right now) Any turn will generate them. They're exacerbated through unbanked turns, fast turns, and tight turns. Make your turns banked in almost every situation, make them fast enough to generate some Gs but not too fast, and make them wide. Never do radius 2 turns unless it's right before or after a lift or under 15 mph. Likewise, always do banked diagonal turns with spacing above 60 mph. Spacing: putting a straight piece in between wide diagonal turns.

Vertical Gs are misunderstood. You absolutely want negative Gs as they make you float. The best coasters in the world have extended periods of ""airtime"" and airtime is what gives most* coasters excitement. Negative Gs are generated at peaks, but too sharp a peak (steep-medium-flat-medium-steep in one movement, no spacing) can make guests jerk out too violently. Positive Vertical Gs are made from the bottom of hills. Never ever ever go straight from steep or vertical to medium to flat. Your peeps will be crushed and your ratings will skyrocket (except for excitement). You have to space it out with some medium slope pieces or use the long steep-flat piece in RCT2.

After you do this, your ratings will improve. Then you can go to excitement. Fossil covers this well on his site. Read through his coaster pack pages and his articles. He'll teach you everything.

And finally, something of note: RCT rides are meant to be based off real rides. The ride files themselves are named after manufacturers and models. Go to www.rcdb.com/ and educate yourself.

Hey everyone,

Below are the team assignments and schedule for everyone signed up for the Redditland cooperative parks. We had a total of 49 slots filled, with 45 individual participants. It's a great turnout, and I'm really happy with the response. I hope you guys are as excited to get working on this as I am!

On some of the parks, there will be specific items I ask that you obtain (if you don't already have them). These will help the park sharing process, and in some cases they are the only way you'll be able to open the park.

The benches are all ready (except for the RCT3 ones, but they're quick to make), and will be divided into islands for each individual participant over the course of the next three days. Benches will initially be distributed publicly, so everyone can see their territory and begin planning on their own, should they so choose.

Without further adieu, here are the teams and schedules!

[Here's an example](http://i.imgur.com/hHv3oaw.png)

The middle circle acts as a trigger for the outside rides.  The speed at which each ride is activated can be shortened or lengthened by extending or shortening the amount of track between each station on the trigger track.  Changing the speed of the launch helps too.  This will only work if the ""block section launch"" option is chosen, along with there being the alternating exit/entrances at each station.

I noticed that I was a bit short of my guest goal, and Oct Year 2 was coming up, so I started ramping up my advertising. Decreased park tickets to $0, put a no-entry sign in front of the park exit, the works.

I hope I'm not the only one who has noticed this.

Here's some examples:

* For one, much of the added stuff looks hideous when compared to the usual scenery in the game. Take for example [these palm trees](http://i.imgur.com/LDZ0U.png); the one on the left is the standard palm tree as seen throughout the first and second game, the one on the right is an exclusive item found in the American Themeing in Wacky Worlds. The standard palm has a rather narrow color palette; all the tones are very Earthy and the contrast between them is minimal. All and all this works because the whole game's art design is set like this. However when looking at the tree on the right, the palms have these screeching neon green tones to them, and all and all the sprite is less complex than the standard palm's sprite, despite it being bigger.

* Everything looks like it was made out of plastic. The first picture was a good example of this, but you can see it even more when looking at [these cacti](http://i.imgur.com/0sxYf.png). Again because of the exaggerated color scheme used in the WW/TT themes, the exclusive cactus stands out like a plastic lawn ornament, while the standard cactus is very subtle with its colors and blends well with whatever's around it.

* A lot of the stuff is HUGE. Take [these similar statues](http://i.imgur.com/CnYTP.png) for example. The regular horseback rider is only slightly taller than the guests sprites, so it's size compared to them looks entirely plausible. However the big Washington Statue from the American themeing is monstrous with the base being twice as large and the height nearly three times as tall. Rather than blending in with the area around it something of this scale looks entirely out of place. You can also see this and another example of the bad color palette in [these pine trees](http://i.imgur.com/6dvwr.png).

* Another issue is some of the scenery just doesn't have any versatility. Take [these craters](http://i.imgur.com/3btajh.png) as an example. With the one on the left (found in the martian themeing group), you can use it for a lot of different purposes. Put some of the fire jets from the mechanical themeing inside it and you have an erupting volcano. Run a vertical drop coaster down through the center of it and you have a badass transition to an underground track. However, with the crater on the right from the future themeing, all you can do with it is use it as a set piece. In all respects it's just like a great big useless rock that really doesnt look good with anything around it.

I suppose this is just me offering up my take on why the scenarios in RCT2 don't work very well. Of course there's the poor park design in some, but for me a real hindrance is a park that just does not look pretty. Some of the added themes were good (such as the Alcatraz island map, one of my favorites in the game entirely), but with most of the maps it just seems that Simon Foster either gave up or the spritework got put in the hands of someone else.

[The Backside](http://i.imgur.com/kazQLGD.png) of the Wooden Coaster.  In the empty area, I'm going to figure out how to add some more flats over there, with maybe a few more food/shop stalls.

Hope you all enjoy.  I have the next few days off so I'm hoping to finish up a lot of my park, and focusing on some more details.

I'm going to probably re-work my entry way and my tram stations because the entry way just seems to boring to me, and the tram stations take up far to much space.   I also am debating on if the Mountain is enough of a center piece or not.  I might try my hand and making a big resort hotel in the last open corner of my park, or I might black that corner out.

It was my life. While all my other friends were playing Command &amp; Conquer, I was designing coasters. Who could pass that up? Playing it has provided some of the best memories of my childhood.

I had played the demo way before that from some obscure CD my Aunt had given me. It's still something I remember vividly, scrolling through the list of all these games when I saw ""Rollercoaster Tycoon"", and it just jumped out at me. Probably because I had seen my cousin play Transport Tycoon, and I wondered if it were similar.

I was blown away by it. I played the demo scenarios (Forest Frontiers, Diamond Heights and... Evergreen Gardens, I think) for hours on end. At least 30 times for each scenario until I got the game for myself. It was the first game I ever owned. I remember I got to pick it out for my 10th birthday way back in 1999. My parents wouldn't let me play it until my birthday, so I stayed up until midnight just to install it and get a glimpse of all the new content not in the demo.

Yeah, I was hooked. For the following year or two, I put hours and hours in every week. After that I dropped off, but I still got in a few hours here and there. Not to toot my own horn, but I became fucking good at it. I mean, I knew how to build coasters just right the first time, with only a minor edit here and there. Beating even the difficult scenarios became easy... so I went looking for more.

I was pretty active on a lot of RCT sites back in the day, both official and fansites. Downloaded a much as I could and kept playing. I'm sure I've got some of that obscure shit on floppy disks somewhere. I definitely remember having all of those extra park designs only available through download, especially the complete set of RCT-to-RCT2 scenario conversions.

RCT2 was much the same. Although it lacked some of the appeal of the first game (I liked the restriction - helped me innovate), the new options and design types were rather liberating. Probably the peak of my RCT-career was when I designed a triple-stacked 8-wide air-powered coaster set (that's 24 coasters). Their launch speeds were all synced up so every coaster all reached their respective peak at exactly the same time. I think it was featured on TycoonPlanet.com back in the day.

Reading this subreddit makes me feel bad I hawked off my original CDs, boxes and manuals (including expansions). I can see how valued it is now, but who knew at the time, right? I held onto that stuff for many years, long after I stopped actively playing the game. I was pretty sentimental about the game.

Anyway... if anything, the length of this post is testament to just how much this game means to me! ",Meta,False,,t5_2rzsl,False,met,,True,t3_19rysz,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/19rysz/just_stumbled_across_this_place_oh_the_memories/,

Also, if there's some macro-option that just fixes every broken (insert scenery item here) in the park, I'd love to know about that too. My last few parks have really suffered because I just said screw it and didn't build any benches or garbage cans or breakable scenery because these mofos can't be trusted and I don't have the money to be employing 100 friggin security guards to protect my $3 trash cans and $5 benches.

1343273278.0,28,self.rct,x658a,Reddit Park Update: OFFICIAL PROJECT RULES,keytarin,29,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/x658a/reddit_park_update_official_project_rules/,"This update is to give everyone participating an outline of the rules and guidelines for our project park. These rules can be subject to change, but for now this is how this project will run.

**Overview:** Reddit Land is a community project for /r/rct for members to collaborate and build a theme park together. This project will be administered by myself and Valdair. For the project we will be splitting the participants into two groups, and there will be two active versions of the same map, similar to this map. Half of the participants will be assigned to one, the other half to the other, and Valdair and I will moderate and distribute one map each. Each participant will receive a turn to edit their own plot of land, after which we will distribute it to the next person. Once everyone receives a turn, we can send the map back to any participant who requests further edits, and once all is done we will release the final maps.

**Project Rules:**

* Each participant will be in ownership of the map for five days, during which they may build their section of the park. At the end of this time period, or if the player finishes their section before their time limit ends, they must private message the save game file back to the moderator.

* The save game file will be distributed via private message. Once your turn arrives you will receive a message from myself or Valdair (depending on what group you are assigned to) containing a link to download the save game file over [Mediafire](http://www.mediafire.com/). To install you simply paste the file into your saved games folder for RCT2 (typically it's a variation of C://Program Files &gt; Atari &gt; Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 &gt; Saved Games). The file should be available under the 'load saved game' menu option in the game. For turning in your completed section, you simply upload the saved game to mediafire, then PM the link back to either Valdair or myself.

* **If the player fails to message the save file back to the moderator within 24 hours after their deadline passing, their turn will be voided and the next participant will receive the last save file prior to the voided participant.**

* If a player runs out of time to edit their property, they are free to request further time. Requested time is given to the player after every contestant has had their initial turn. Requested time may not be used to extend the deadline of their initial turn.

* Trainers are not required but are allowed.

* Custom scenery imports, DIMports, and any other modifications to the park object data (scenery, ride types, etc) are forbidden.

**In-game Rules:**

* This project will take place in Roller Coaster Tycoon 2.

* Each player is assigned a plot of land that is in their control. The land plots are divided from each other by a river system, and links from one plot to the next are made from pre-built bridges.

* Players are free to choose to develop and build on their land however they see fit, as long as there is access to the bridges provided to span the divider rivers.

* Players are not allowed to construct, modify, delete, or tamper with any other participant's land, rides, scenery, etc. Players are not allowed to edit the land in a way that would heavily alter the rivers dividing the park. Players may not delete the pre-made bridges or create new bridges linking two different land plots. Any violation is subject to disqualification for the offending player.

* Players are allowed to build over the rivers dividing their land from others, **AS LONG AS** a support column does NOT make contact with the ground of a neighbor's land plot, like [here](http://i.imgur.com/XeD4J.png).

* The park as a whole is to remain CLOSED for the duration of the project. Opening the park to guests during player editing is not allowed. Only at the end of all construction from every participant will the park be opened and put up for public sharing. This rule is to allow the park to be play-tested after construction is done. If the park is open while someone is working on it, if a problem comes up in another player's land (ride crashes, etc) it would be the responsibility of the person currently editing it to fix it. Therefore if the park remains closed during construction, everyone can build without taking care of other player's land.

* All staff must have assigned patrol areas. There will be no free-roaming staff members in the park. General rule of thumb for mechanics is one mechanic per two/three rides, large attractions can have an exclusive mechanic.
The player should provide sufficient facilities (food/drink stalls, restrooms, etc) for their land.

* Duplicate ride types are allowed, however it is discouraged (instead of building the park's third wooden coaster, why not try a Bobsled or a shuttle loop corkscrew?)

* Above all, make your land so that if it were a park by itself it would be functional. All the basic strategies of the game apply.",,False,,t5_2rzsl,1343275081.0,,,True,t3_x658a,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/x658a/reddit_park_update_official_project_rules/,

* Please respect it if people don't want advice or critique, if you REALLY need to, ask the person first.

1343094342.0,26,self.rct,x1sj9,An idea: A massive collaboration park by us members of r/RCT,keytarin,28,2,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/x1sj9/an_idea_a_massive_collaboration_park_by_us/,"After reading [this post by Alex_English](http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/x07jw/would_anyone_be_interested_in_making_a_park_with/), it gave me an idea of a sort of project: A Reddit Park put together by us. It would be a big task for us but if we can coordinate this enough we could have a really cool park that all of us put together.

Some ideas on how we can do this:

* We take a big empty sandbox park and divide it up into chunks, and each one of us gets one chunk to fill up on our own.

* We make a list of who would do what; create a run-down of which order everyone's contributions will be added, and pass the save file from one to the next.

This would take a heck-of-a lot of coordination between us in order to keep the park up to date and make sure we aren't editing stuff at the same time, but I think it would be possible.

This is just an idea I had. Any of you guys have feelings over it? Whether or not it can be done? How would we go about doing it? Should we do it?

**Edit**: Well it seems like we do have interest in this idea, so maybe in the next few days we can figure out how we will organize this. Some points I think we should definitely discuss:

* **Will this project take place in it's own subreddit?** Updates on this project could potentially spam RCT's main sub so should we keep this off in it's own sub so as everything is easy to find and organize between us?

* **How will the park be divided among us?** Will the land be cut into regular grids or would each section be sort of 'freeform'; the barriers being the natural landscape around them such as canyons, mountains, rivers, etc. Also how would plots be distributed among participants; would it be given out randomly, would it be first-come-first-serve, or would the map be pre-made to cater to different players' requests (for me I love building out-and-back style coasters so I'd prefer a lengthy but narrow plot versus a generally round/square-shaped plot).

* **How will this be moderated?** Because of how saved files work in RCT, we would all need to take turns building one at a time. How would the master park be distributed? Who would be in charge? How much say can moderators have? Would there be time limits for each player or would once one's finished with their additions they pass it on to the next?

* **What would the rules be?** Do players have to stick precisely to their defined land, or would they have a bit of leeway overlapping into others' territories? Would trainers be allowed? Would custom scenery be allowed or would it be limited to the default provided by the game?

This is what I can think of right now. Feel free to bring up any other major points I missed. The more organized we get this the better and more awesome our creation will be.

Hey guys,

So I got the park benches done earlier than I expected, which is probably great news for you all, haha! Everyone, feel free to explore the bench for the park you're on. Those starting each park, you're free to start working now!

---

**Rules**

* Parks for Loopy Landscapes and RCT2 should change hands via PM or private subreddits. When you are finished, you should send the park file to both the next person on the schedule *and* me.

* RCT3 parks should change hands in whatever way the group decides on (I recommend google drive). You must notify everyone in your team, as well as myself, every time an update is made and shared. This notification can be as simple as a screenshot, or as complex as the full park file. Periodically, I'll ask for a backup copy from whoever is working on the park. I expect you to comply.

* From this point on, unless something makes the bench unusable, they're set in stone. Please don't ask me to change land or scenery objects, because I won't. Work with what you have available. 

* That said, **If anything major is wrong with any of the benches, let me know ASAP.**

* I've made a ""Redditland"" flair for everyone to use as a spoiler tag. You're free to post any content from these parks that you want, but some users would like to be surprised by the ending. If content is from your Redditland, use the new flair instead of whatever game it's from.

* Respect other people's land and creations. Don't delete anything you didn't make. Don't build where you aren't designated, unless you get permission from the player whose land it is. Note: The [3] benches don't have land designations, so you can build wherever you want. You still need to respect other people's creations, though.

* Trading land is allowed, though I ask that you keep it to a minimum. I don't need to approve it or anything, it just needs to be settled between you and the person you want to trade with. However, trading land will not change your spot in the schedule.

* Merging territories is also allowed, as long as you agree with whoever you're merging with.

* You **MUST** submit the park to the next user on time. If you're even a day late, I will send them my most recent backed up copy to work off of, which will likely not include your work. If this is cause for concern, feel free to update me more frequently than required, so the next person in line can have something from you.

I'll be keeping backups of all the parks. I'll be keeping the original bench, and backups of every time it changes hands. If something goes wrong, I don't want everyone's work to go to waste.

I think that's it here. Let me know if I'm missing anything.

---

**Tips**

Download the benches now. Get familiar with what each bench includes and omits. Know the land that you have to work with. Start planning what you want to do.

Saving track designs and structures is a good way to maximize your limited time with each park.

Communicate frequently with your teammates. If you want to, say, have your coaster interact with a previous player's log flume, you shouldn't hesitate to ask. I've even had someone ask me if he and another player could be paired together so that they could do this.

Some of you have created private subreddits. That's a great idea. Keep up with it, and I think it could be an invaluable tool for your teams. If your team doesn't have one, feel free to make one and add it to the [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/wiki/redditland2013).

No one has asked, but I don't think a lot of people around here actually even know what it *is*, so we have to start somewhere.

&gt;**Concept**

So, imagine you want to recreate something like Son of Beast, or perhaps an Intamin strata coaster. The tracks for the train types associated with those rides simply don't possess the proper track elements to allow you to build that way. Well, there's a way around that. Any of you who opened Castello dal Mare and watched Velocità di Volo might have noticed this. It's quite a simple process, and it's the gateway to a lot of cool stuff that can be done in RCTLL and RCT2, so I think you guys should know. Disclaimer: You're gonna need 8cars. You guys having issues with Wine... well, I think you're SOL. Another disclaimer: it is a VERY VERY VERY GOOD IDEA to save before you start this, because even if you do everything right there's still a chance the game gets angry and error traps you. No one likes being access violated, and if you save before doing anything risky it's not going to piss you off and cost you a keyboard/monitor.

&gt;**Tools**

I prefer 8cars v1.302 for this, as 1.32 has some bugs, and should really only be used for invisible tracks and hacked chain lifts (and a few other features that it was specifically created to perform).

&gt;**The Process**

We're going to use an example track, our station (the ride we want accessible) in red, the track we want to use for the merge in blue. It's a good idea to name both rides (anything will do, so long as it isn't the default) before you start to make them easier to find in 8cars. The pieces being merged must be PRECISELY the same piece, facing the same direction. If you merge backwards pieces, you're going to get an error trapper when a train travels over it.

So starting with the simplest of things, [here's what you want it to look like](http://i.imgur.com/8p6Md.jpg). Note that the STARTING track is on top initially, and mimics the piece beneath it exactly. When going back to the starting track, the reverse happens. This holds true for any number of merges. The track the train is on must be merged on top of the track it is going to (you can merge any number of times, although the more variables you introduce the more likely you are to error trap yourself - error trappers make the dancing panda sad).

Once you have that built, you must paint the track to be merged. This is not optional. You can use any of the alternate color schemes, but to keep it simple we're going to use #1, and [I've made them both white so they stand out](http://i.imgur.com/aJeiT.jpg). You can color them however you wish, just make sure the pieces are painted.

Now you tab out to 8cars per Trainer, and go to Rides -&gt; Edit Ride Stats. Use the drop-down to find your main track (this is why you want it named, it will appear on the right - if it's the default name that will be blank), and [do all these things](http://i.imgur.com/hrf1x.jpg). Raise/Lower must be checked, and you must select the alternative color scheme you used on the track to be merged. In addition, the height of the track is important. In RCT2, 1 unit = 5ft, so keep that in mind. Since each track was only 10ft over the other, we use -2 for both - hit OK or Apply and it should lower. The operating mode I will go over in a bit. [You need to do basically the same thing for the other track](http://i.imgur.com/8xXTH.jpg), then hit OK/Apply and go back to the game. [Your track should look something like this](http://i.imgur.com/PMs2k.jpg). If the track did not lower, make sure to check that a) it is painted properly, and b) you checked Raise/Lower in the Rides Menu.

If you test the ride, [the train glides right over it](http://i.imgur.com/Kaqlp.jpg)... [and right back onto the original track](http://i.imgur.com/USdlV.jpg). The ride will get its stats as normal. To those who actually care about the stats, no, merging does not give any kind of boost or detriment, it counts the path of the train all the same.

&gt;**A More Complex Example**

Good design rarely, if ever, employs any straight track whatsoever, so how to do this stuff on a real layout? Well, let's say you want to get the wide steep-to-flat pieces on an Arrow looping style track (corkscrew coaster) - normally this is impossible, but with some simple trickery it's extremely easy. [Here's an example I've set up](http://i.imgur.com/5KKge.jpg) - note the height differences due to the clearances of the respective track pieces. -2 will not work in this case, and you have to look at the actual height difference. 105 - 75 = 30ft, which means 6 units. 100 - 85 = 15ft, which means 3 units. Heading back to the 8cars Rides Menu, [this is how you would modify the main track](http://i.imgur.com/uBA5F.jpg). The dummy track is modified in the same manner as before, just with -3 for raise/lower. I circled the operating mode here again for an important reason. If you leave the ride on Continuous Circuit mode, you won't be able to run it, as RCT will think the track is incomplete. Block Sectioned mode will not work either, nor will Powered Launch Block Section. Powered Launch will, however, as will Boat Hire. I prefer Boat Hire because the train departs the station at a normal speed, and you can have several trains on the circuit, as opposed to just one with Powered Launch Mode. If we apply both modifications, back in game we see [our train crosses the element with ease](http://i.imgur.com/pIgVL.jpg).

&gt;**Another Thing**

Another cool thing this raising/lowering business lets us do is realistic catwalks. [Construct an Arrow 4D (multidimensional) coaster lift over your ride's](http://i.imgur.com/FmFUJ.jpg), and then in 8cars, do the same thing as before, [except with ""Main"" selected as the color scheme, and the height modification applied](http://i.imgur.com/IvlZj.jpg). Back in game, [this is what we get](http://i.imgur.com/3o9rw.jpg).

This will work with just about any track to any other track - HOWEVER, please note that the roller coasters are sprite-based. The trains will not animate for an element they are not designed for. Thanks to zrowny for [a lovely example of just such a case](http://i.imgur.com/715lr.png). Notable examples are vertical track for giga coaster trains, and barrel rolls or corkscrews for vertical coaster trains. Best case, the trains look a little funny going through the element, worst case you error trap yourself. However, cars like the corkscrew trains can go through B&amp;M/steel twister large elements with no issue, and they can go vertical as well. The same goes for flying trains (both types). Exercise caution, but don't be afraid to experiment. Also, I strongly advise against merging on diagonals, and erasing track down to a diagonal (to build a dummy track, perhaps) can error trap you.

&gt;**Reverse Merging**

Note that, if a train travels backwards over a standard merge, as detailed above, the train will either crash, or you'll get an error trapper (probably the former - I know from experience &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; ).

I wanted to use a really simple example for this, as it's not applicable in most all situations. But the only thing you have to do is accommodate the merge both forward and backward, [like so](http://i.imgur.com/3gkTD.jpg). Since this is already a powered launch coaster that only needs a single train, no operating mode changes need to be made, you just have to lower the tracks.

I know lots of people already do this, but I figured it could be discussed here as a way to bounce ideas back and forth.

One of the most handy scenery items in my book is [this angled support](http://i.imgur.com/1mgif.png). using this with your coasters, [especially your wooden ones](http://i.imgur.com/5pdOsh.png), can really make the coaster. However, these pieces can also be used quite well on steel coasters too, particularly the more 'height and speed' focused rides like [giga coasters](http://i.imgur.com/NaOS7h.png).

One ride that I built that I think these support structures really pull off well on is [this out-and-back woodie, Tappan Zee](http://i.imgur.com/uI0uJ.jpg) (and if any of you guys live in New England, USA and have ever been up or down the Jersey turnpike, yes I named it after that bridge). If you look at the coaster [without the scenery added on](http://i.imgur.com/CLP8ch.png), it looks very drab and the taller sections look really off being that the supports are just straight up and down. However [once you put on some of those angled supports](http://i.imgur.com/MHlkwh.png), it looks much more appealing. Also one thing that I like to do is run tracks underneath these supports, as with the block brakes section in the picture prior. Sometimes you can get these odd angles from these supports, and here I like to add on little structures, such as [this maintenance/lookout shed](http://i.imgur.com/Burj0h.png).

So this is some of the stuff I like to do with dressing up my coasters. You guys have any input as well as your own techniques for this?",,False,,t5_2rzsl,False,,,True,t3_u4v8c,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/u4v8c/spicing_up_the_structuressupports_on_your_coasters/,

What I'm not entirely pleased with is the station...

Hey /r/rct! I mentioned this idea [a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1ho7bd/idea_scenario_sunday_feature_a_fanfavorite/) and figured I'd get the ball rolling as soon as possible. This event, until further changes, will work like so:

*  Every week, a scenario will be selected for completion by the next week. The selection process is through discussion (not so sure how we can determine that just yet but we'll figure it out).
* You guys will tackle the scenario in whatever way you see fit, as usual. After the one week, you get to show it off.
* Trainers can be used, this is not a contest. You can play for the challenge or for pure creativity. As long as you **mention if you used a trainer**.
* The goal here is discussion. Share strategies, ask for help, comment on progress, or compare total number of deaths! Hopefully that's not too many.
* This is for fun, no real rules and no judging for points. Of course, if you like what you see, go ahead and upvote.
* **Some parks used will be from an older game**, in which case, if you only own RCT2, there is a [database full of RCT1 scenario recreations in RCT2](http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1h93gx/more_exact_recreations_of_rct1_scenarios_for_rct2/). RCT3 players most likely won't be left out either, [thanks to this site](http://mikeworleymusic.com/rct3/).

**EDIT: I need to make a small change to the way this works. Everyone can share Dinky Park NEXT WEEK, allowing for the post's Title to announce the *next* park, instead of the current one, so no one misses out on what is discussed as the next park. So, to reiterate, ignore todays post for now. It'll serve as the announcement for Dinky Park, which we'll awkwardly rediscuss NEXT WEEK. The post of next week will include the new scenario for the following week.** Questions?

I think I mentioned everything, so we'll go ahead and begin todays showcase, **Dinky Park**.

[2],inthemanual,24,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1gp4nc/remember_that_post_about_getting_swan_cars_onto/,"I figured it out, and thought I'd share. It comes with a catch: the splash boat track has to be at an odd height. This means using MoM to lower the track by 1 unit after it's built. This is because if you don't the swans go through the track rather than on it.

First, build the track you want the swans to follow using Splash Boat (or whatever track you want). Test it and save it. 

Next, change the land type under the track to ice or one of the grid colors. Remove the station. If you want a visible boarding platform build it LATER with scenery or river rapids track. Now lower the track with MOM in 8cars. Your MOM Menu should look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ZGh7gbP.png)

Next, rebuild the ride above itself and lower it (using Edit Ride Stats) to the height the other track was at before you lowered it with MOM. You don't need to include entrance/exit huts, but you do need a station platform. Edit Ride Stats should look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/V3D5wrl.png)

Now, build the swan ride. The entrance and exit for THIS ride will be where guests actually get on/off the ride, so try to put it close to the boarding platform. The swan track needs to have exactly one straight piece in the same space as a straight piece of the Splash boat track, but in the opposite direction. The swan boat piece of track needs to be built after the splash boats piece. 

Use Edit Ride Stats to change the operating mode of the swan boats to Continuous circuit mode. Open the swan boat ride. Wait for the swans to merge onto the other track. you'll be able to see how the swans go through the track instead of on top of it. We fix this by making the top layer of track invisible by changing the track type using Edit Ride Stats to Crooked house. It should look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/TsOjp0t.png) now. If you want to get rid of the now unneeded swan boat track, make it invisible in the same way. We now have a result that looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Sb9fgsP.png). For mine, I raised water up to the track level. You do not have to do that, I just thought it looked better. My images also have entrance and exit huts on the splash ride track. Those do not need to be there. I also have the peep entrance FAR from the boarding platform, which causes all the peeps to walk on the water from the entrance to the platform. It's not efficient or realistic, but you can fix that. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. If you want more screenshots of the process to help, I can provide those as well.",RCT2,False,,t5_2rzsl,1371695039.0,,,True,t3_1gp4nc,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1gp4nc/remember_that_post_about_getting_swan_cars_onto/,

I thought I would share with you my latest project, as compensation for my not competing in the May competition [because I'm sure you'll miss me ;)]

This is Worlds Collide Amusement Park, a little something I have been working on using the April bench. NCSO is quickly becoming my favourite format in RCT - it forces innovation, like LL, but it is not so restrictive that it becomes frustrating like LL. It is also a more instinctive and relaxed building style for me than having to struggle with custom scenery objects, half of which I have no idea how to use.

This park is heavily inspired by the likes of Matsku and Lunatim, whose work was what really got me into RCT. While I admire the skill and effort which goes into the ultra-realistic work that tends to be the norm over at NE these days, that is not and never will be my style - I just don't have the patience, and to me it seems more like work than like fun. The best thing about building this park was that it was fun: I went in with no plan, just a vague idea for a launched steeplechase ride, and then just let my imagination run wild! If you're struggling along with realism, I'd recommend going right back to basics and giving something like this a go.

Anyway, enjoy it! If you download the park I'd recommend giving the gallery a look too, it explains a few things.

[RCT2]",RichardBachman,27,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/tdruz/building_a_hyper_coaster_step_by_step_rct2/,"Alright, let me see how this works out.  I'm just going to start off here and you just let me know if it was helpful at all.  If I get some positive feedback I'll keep going.

I'm just going to do a 200ft tall hyper twister and try to keep it compact.  Let's see if I can get an 8 or 8.5 excitement rating on a flat land coaster...

(it came out to 8.55, btw)

Station:

Build it off the ground.  Not too high, but you want the train to be going pretty slow at the end, so if you put it 4 or 5 spaces off the ground, that's 20 or 25 mph you don't have to worry about.

Also, when you're done you can run your exit/entrance path under the station which increases excitement.


Note that I'm starting at the back of the station:

http://i.imgur.com/9HPCG.jpg

I like to go ahead and complete the last few pieces of track.  It gives you a different target that's a lot more flexible if things don't line up at the end.  I mean, think about it, you spend the last half of designing a coaster worrying about lining it up with the station.  Why not go ahead and complete the last little bit so it looks decent while giving yourself some wiggle room?


Block brakes plus a block of 3 progressive brakes for the 2nd train:   http://i.imgur.com/ydFdb.jpg

An ending element that's better than just jack-knifing the track around to line up with the station (note that there's a 50% chance I'll rethink this at the end): http://i.imgur.com/3x3bv.jpg

Lift hill

I usually put a small drop and a pretty wide turn out of the station, reversing the lift hill back around.  This saves space and, like many real coasters, you get some speed right out of the station.  Leaves room for the entrance path on that side, too.

http://i.imgur.com/9fxM2.jpg

I like all my coasters to be realistic so my hyper coasters almost always have a 200ft first drop.

What I did here was take it to 225 feet, drop one level, loop back around for the first drop.  As you can see, this let's me use the smoother steep to flat conversion at the bottom and ends up exactly ground level.  You may have to rebuild your lift hill a few times to get it just right.

http://i.imgur.com/ggwUs.jpg

THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL COASTERS:  When your train flies at high speed at ground level, it raises the excitement.  This is why tunnels are so effective because that makes it ""ground level"" on all sides.  Aim for ground level at high speed whenever you can.


I almost always go for a big second drop as well.  At the crest of each hill, this is where you get your ""air time"".  So, the drop started at 220ft.  Speed decreases exponentially in this game, so at this level, we want to reduce the height of the 2nd hill more than usual.  I'm guessing somewhere around 180 feet will be ideal:

http://i.imgur.com/zMX8c.jpg

For hyper coasters, your trains should crest hills IDEALLY at 30-45 MPH.  More than that and your negative G's start getting uncomfortable.  Less than that and your ""air time"" turns into ""seat time"".

So, you have to test it.  Here, I've just made a random loop around at the bottom of my track and ran it back into the station.  I've built an entrance/exit, and put it on test.  I've set the view to look at train1.  I'm watching to see how fast it goes over the top of that first hill:

http://i.imgur.com/kXs8n.jpg

32mph is what it actually crested at.  Not too shabby.

Now comes the fun part.

Comments and corrections are welcome.  If  you learned something, please let me know and I'll continue later.




Continued...

Alright, on to the next hill.  I brought it back up to 165ft, I think...

http://i.imgur.com/l1Rhk.jpg

Seems like I had it in the shot, but it's not there now.  Anyway,

I tried 2 large curved down tracks but it doesn't line up at ground level.  If you follow the highlighted square, it lands directly between my tracks at ground level and it's too close to my entrance path I will eventually build.  So I replaced the first curved track with a short one.  Now I'm lined up to cross tracks again, which will raise the excitement.

http://i.imgur.com/6bNm7.jpg

I crested the last hill at under 40mph so I'm reducing the height of the next hill some...

http://i.imgur.com/BQVwG.jpg

I went ahead and built a track back to the station to test the speed at the top of that 2nd hill and it was right at 40 mph...

http://i.imgur.com/QRoJc.jpg

I took the next hill at 140ft using the large arch at the top.

http://i.imgur.com/PJnxh.jpg

Enough up and down and up and down, time for some turns.  Start with a wide banked track then 2 helix.

http://i.imgur.com/liMgN.jpg

Then wide out to one side, then back.

http://i.imgur.com/ZdfgV.jpg

That helix is way too fast for most twisters and it will drive my intensity rating up, but I'm trying to make this thing short, sweet, compact and cheap.  I'll sacrifice some intensity for excitement.


I tried a height of 135ft for the next hill and got this:

http://i.imgur.com/idwm6.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/wtl6L.jpg

Way too slow.  So I went back and shaved it down to 115ft.

http://i.imgur.com/aAk6L.jpg

Using the steep to level slope at the bottom I ended up with a low height of 15ft.  This puts my track right where it needs to be to run over top of that other track that's at 5ft.

http://i.imgur.com/auq1l.jpg

Another twist and I can cross right over the other track and give myself some room to go back uphill.

http://i.imgur.com/rLAb5.jpg

The last hill was 115ft, so we'll go ahead and drop down to 100ft for the next one.

http://i.imgur.com/sRahG.jpg

To keep the track tight I'm going to turn it around here and head back into the meat of the coaster.  There's not much track between these 2 hills so it's safe to go back up to 100ft again.

http://i.imgur.com/fczBP.jpg

Again, using the steep to level conversion at the bottom I can get it to land right at ground level.

http://i.imgur.com/kQaen.jpg

In the interest of using as many different track pieces as I can, I put some vertical slopes on the next hill.  I suspected my trains were probably going a little faster than I wanted at this point so I went back up to 105ft instead of doing the faster 95ft crest.

http://i.imgur.com/LCIX8.jpg

And by building some connecting pieces back to the station, I confirmed that 105ft was about ideal:

http://i.imgur.com/CCQZY.jpg

Now, I've got a pretty smooth track here even though it's flying at high speeds into the station.  I wonder what the excitement level is at right now?

http://i.imgur.com/Q7qyV.jpg

Niiiiiice.  It even looks pretty nice. http://i.imgur.com/jFBtx.jpg 

Sometimes, though, you'll sculpt a coaster and think you got everything right but then you test it about 3/4's of the way through and the stats are crap.  If I weren't at a 7 or 8 excitement at this point I'd consider scrapping the entire thing and starting from scratch.

OK, I want to use 3 trains so I'm going to put a block brake station in here next.  I know that at 105ft the trains are traveling at around 35mph, so to have it crawl through the block brake section I'm going to try 110ft.

http://i.imgur.com/eQzRU.jpg

Of all the track pieces, the twisting steep track is by far the ugliest in my opinion.  I try to avoid them whenever possible.  But where I'm at right now, I want to head back into the heart of the coaster and weave this track around to grab a little more excitement.  So I used 2 of those funky pieces to line me up to run right back in there.

http://i.imgur.com/Oxjk2.jpg

I see a lot of people building coasters here where it looks like they try to avoid going back into the twisting, diving parts they already have built.  I don't know if people are just afraid they'll get stuck in there and have to delete everything or what's going on, but I actively try to twist my coaster back into existing track pieces.

A large helix after that drop to lose some speed:

http://i.imgur.com/Gp1kM.jpg


Here I was able to land at 15ft again, in the right direction to cross a 5ft section of track

http://i.imgur.com/08Njq.jpg

With those pieces in place I was able to connect back to the station for a test run to make sure that block brake section isn't too high.  It crawls up there at about 15mph which, on a real coaster, would make an engineer shit his pants but we'll let it slide.

http://i.imgur.com/qvP78.jpg

Here I've added a hill, a turn and, once again, I'm headed back into the meat of the coaster.

http://i.imgur.com/tRZgd.jpg

Some turns and another helix:

http://i.imgur.com/zduVD.jpg

I really didn't think this next part would work.  But that's usually when I head straight in there.  If it looks like it won't work then you know the tracks will be close on all sides and you'll get some extra excitement.  Turns out, it worked perfectly.

http://i.imgur.com/O0hIh.jpg

Squeeeeze through there...

http://i.imgur.com/EBrKd.jpg

Alright, I'm now in return to station mode.  I'm happy with the track, now I just have to get the peeps back to the station.  I'm not going to picture every element I put in, you can see them in the final product.  It's just a couple of helix,  2 small hills and then back to the helix I put in at the end of the station when I began.

http://i.imgur.com/zy7I8.jpg

8.55exc / 8.65int  Totally flat land with no scenery, landscaping, paths or other rides.

Here's the finished product if you want to download it.

http://www.sendspace.com/file/qx4tpm

I know sendspace sucks, feel free to rehost it.

Here it is in a park with paths, scenery and trees.

http://i.imgur.com/iJakD.jpg

This is not my ""best track"" by any means.  I was drunk last night and bored so I thought I'd throw something together.  If you spend a little more time getting all the elements lined up right where you want them you can easily pull off a 9 or 9.5 excitement flat land coaster.

I decided to make an all-in-one resource to find whatever kind of ride references you may need, whether it be photos, statistics, awards, manufacturers, etc.

---

###How to Use This Guide

This guide is meant to be a portal to good references you can use to find information on real life rides. Real life is often great inspiration for RCT parks.

You may want to create a custom flat ride for RCT2, and you want to know what it looks like and how it works. This can help. You may want to recreate your favorite roller coaster. This can get you there. You may want to imitate a manufacturer's style. This has their information. I'm sure you could find a lot more uses for the information I've compiled.

I will continue to update this as I get more information.

---

###Existing Ride Databases

There are several very good databases you can look at that keep historical records of rides. Some keep track of them differently than others, so it's good to have a few, depending on how you're looking for it.

- The [Rollercoaster Database](http://rcdb.com/) is a great source of information on rollercoasters from wild mice, to now-dismantled coasters, to the tallest coasters on the planet, to the newest ones being built. It is a record, complete with photo galleries in most cases, of almost every roller coaster to be built around the world. 
http://rcdb.com/

- [Flat Joint](http://www.flatrides.com/rideindex.html) has a very extensive list of flat rides and kiddie rides, both trailer and permanent mounted. It keeps a record of the company that build the ride, and the different types of models that exist, as well as typical ride capacity. Pictures are also provided, as well as the manufacturer's name, which is very useful in determining the difference between, say, a Fabbri Pirate Ship and a Huss Pirate Boat. http://www.flatrides.com/rideindex.html

- The [European Water Ride Database](http://ewrdb.com/rides/) is a great resource for finding flumes, spillways, rapids and the like. However, they are *not* a resource for water slides and other waterpark attractions. Pictures and stats are provided for most of the rides here. However, there doesn't' seem to be an american or worldwide equivalent site, so although there is a good chance you will find what you're looking for, you may not be able to. http://ewrdb.com/

- The [Water Slide Database](http://www.waterslidedatabase.com/apps/photos/) is a fledgling website documenting contributors experiences at waterparks. Since waterparks are so numerous, often with unnamed or similarly named slides as other parks, it's more difficult to create a database for them. But they're trying. And they've got a good start. http://www.waterslidedatabase.com/

###Communities

Several Communities exist outside of Reddit addressing different aspects of the industry.

- [NewElement Designs](http://www.nedesigns.com/) is an active, very high caliber RollerCoaster Tycoon forum for those serious about the games. They predominantly focus on the first two games of the series. Awards, known as ""Accolades"" are periodically awarded to members for quality submissions.

- [ShyGuy's World](http://www.shyguysworld.com/) is similar to NewElement, with a stronger focus on RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. Custom scenery and rides are readily available through this site.

- [Theme Park Review](http://www.themeparkreview.com/) is a community of Theme Park Enthusiasts. Trip Reports, reviews, news, and rumors abound here.

- [CoasterForce](http://www.coasterforce.com/) is another community of enthusiasts. A great feature of their website is the park guides section.

- [American Coaster Enthusiasts](http://www.aceonline.org/) is the dominant theme park fan club. It's kind of like the tabloids of the theme park industry. Sometimes they're right, more often they're wrong, but they're always giving out ""news"".

The same rules apply: that is **there are no rules!**


This time, a local council has been running really short on money and has decided to sell it's *small* local community park to a world class leisure attraction development expert (*pssst! that would be you*). Build a scenery rich, gentle, relaxing and appropriate fun fair on this feature rich plot of land.






**- Scenario Briefing-**


* Selection of gentle/smaller rides (to suit the area)
* Guests prefer less intense rides, they are rich and arrive hungry, thirsty and happy!
* High interest rates and expensive land - to encourage slow growth and attention to detail
* Please ignore the 10 rollercoaster objective, the real objective is to **have fun and post screenshots!**

&gt;I was feeling a bit nostalgic a few weeks ago and decided to install the original RCT and expansion packs, and it was definitely a rewarding experience. As I was playing I was reminded of something else.
There used to be a website that contained a strangely in-depth analysis of the behavior of the peeps, like how their seemingly-random stats were weighted, how they picked their path through the park, etc. I can't seem to find it anymore, though. Google as I might, I'm having very little luck and I'm starting to think it was probably taken down.

&gt;I know it's a shot in the dark, but I'd like to know if anyone remembers seeing this site and remembers where it is/was? I know it was live at least as recently as 2007 (yes I know it's an eon in terms of the internet...)

&gt;Thanks!

I know he's not crazy because I remember the same page he is referring to. Alas, my google-fu has also failed me on this occasion. So we turn to you /r/rct, you're our only hope.

Since twitch chat is about 10 or so seconds behind where I am when I am streaming, I thought I would open a raidcall so that it's a little more organized when it comes to chat participation and what not, and I feel like hearing each other's voices makes it a little more personal than just using chat.

Now, I had a few viewers tonight in raidcall with me and it was good old fun and what not. Then, we had this idea. How about we set-up a raidcall for the RCT subreddit, and people could kind of just discuss ride ideas, contest stuff, and other general banter to just kind of pass the time. Kind of like our own little ventrilo/teamspeak channel for RCT except raidcall is free.

This contest should run A LOT smoother now that I had more than a days planning.

Thank you to all of you that participated in last months contest, We had an OK turn out and it wasn't advertized nearly as much as this will be.

After seeing a few posts of people stating they don't like more than one of a type of ride in a park, i decided to make a Fair ground-style scenario. Oh, and don't worry, THESE  BRIDGES WORK.

Since the community is voting more influences who wins than guidelines I offer this advice: The goal is to make this like a State Fair, so build and vote appropriately.

Here is the scenario: http://min.us/mk9KHsc38

I threw in 2 coaster types for a little ""help"". I don't usually see them at State fairs

Good luck. The contest ends on May 5th

Thought it'd be fun to show off some of my older work. This is from a few months back before getting competitive here. Park gets a little bit messy and probably would have cleaned up a bit had it had custom supports and better scenery. 

For anyone looking to take it on yourself, just remember that your first few coasters don't have to make the length, just be extendable (or deletable) and just bring in cash at first. When making the length, height and sweeping turns are your friends. In terms of trying to stay semi realistic with both of those, just use the terrain :)",RCT2,False,,t5_2rzsl,False,two,,True,t3_1jb68c,http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1jb68c/my_take_on_octagon_park_rct2/,

This is the first time I've attempted something of this nature. It was challenging to say the least, but I'm very happy with how it turned out. Everything you see in these pictures was built square by square.

The first step was to build the coaster. For this kind of design, which involves basically a standard cone - shaped type mountain, you want to design of the coaster to mimic the shape of the mountain. This will make it much easier later on when you are actually landscaping. This is challenging since the coaster must be designed rather compact. Once the coaster is done, basically all you do is build the mountain around it. 
This is much easier said than done, however. It took a large amount of tweaking to get the mountain to look natural.

Comments / critiques are appreciated! I'm planning another landscaping project with a mine cart coaster, which will be MUCH easier to make compact.

But think about it; They built the Glassbox engine to handle a simulation on a 1:1 scale (or so they claim). Plus, with the lack of a grid and the whole curved roads thing, you could make prettier paths and better rides. But I'm thinking they could have an optional grid, so you could build a ride sticking to the grid like normal, but then have a section that breaks from the grid and snaps back on when it's done.

On the other hand, they'd need to keep track of individual guests when they get on/off rides and such, which, going by what I've heard from Simcity posts, doesn't happen, let alone each guest having a name, stats, thoughts, items, etc. I'm not sure how much more that'd clog up processing, since I don't know how optimized the engine is to begin with.

And since the Glassbox engine can go online (obviously...), maybe you could have a multiplayer mode, either with rival parks competing for which one gets better business, or multiple people working together on one mega-park.

I'm just saying. Think about it. The map limits in Simcity don't work for an actual city, but maybe they could work for the naturally more compact design of a theme park. And provided they make the AI not as idiotic, you could make an RCT game pretty well in that engine...maybe.

So I decided to show people how to build them properly  so they get their deserved credit :D

**Part 1: What not to do**
http://imgur.com/Qf9hYyK - this is an example of all the wrong things in one ride. (except going fast over hills)

|1 car trains, they tend to slow the trains down too much and they won't make it over some hills

|Never go over 55km/h (34mp/h), it will add a lot of intensity around turns and its unrealistic 

|Going over 40 km/h (29mp/h) at the top of a hill; It will make the ride crash

|Make sure all hils and drops are small

|The ride should be compact, these aren't mine trains or B&amp;M's goddammit

**Part 2: Things to do**
http://i.imgur.com/YD7jsdU.png - This is a good example of some nice side friction coasters. The one on the left is much more unrealistic but has nicer stats, the one on the right  is MUCH more realistic but could be considered a gentle ride.

|Keep the ride height under 15

|Go around 20-35km/h(12-21mp/h) around turns

|Drop height should be at 4 units maximum, any more just looks ugly, makes the trains go too fast, and is unrealistic

|Make sure that most turns are large, tight curves add a lot of intensity


Anyways, I hope I helped out anybody who was having trouble with building these.
