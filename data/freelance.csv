1) You will get cabin fever, often. It's been crucial for me to be on the look out for this. My productivity bottoms out and I start getting a constant feeling of anxiety. Going out of you're working environment for a few hours can make a huge difference. Notice I said a few hours? a few minutes won't change anything.

2) Many ""businesses"" on the internet are posing as something they are not. They want you to believe they are a situated, growing, stable business. My counter for this has been to ask questions. How many employees do you have? How many full time? Do you have an office? etc. You'll learn very quickly what sort of situation they are actually in.

3) Most of the ""time saver"" tools, apps, articles, whatevers, are not going to make you a good Freelancer. The key to success as a freelancer? Work hard. The amount you put in is in direct correlation to what you get out of your freelance career. ( Ironic coming from someone posting on Reddit, I know).

1313795717.0,60,self.freelance,jod31,"Stop ""Freelancing"" and create your own company. That's what I did, and the response is much better for me.",,77,17,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/jod31/stop_freelancing_and_create_your_own_company/,"I'm an honest guy, that's probably my biggest strength but also my biggest weakness.

After I got out of the Army 4 years ago the shift in lifestyles was too drastic for me. I had isolated myself from the outside world once I got home. I used to be able to work in the public setting (stores, restaurants, etc) but when I got out I didn't want to see anyone, or be in the public. Loud noises spooked me, and groups of people gave me a lot of anxiety.

So, while staying at home I began to build some websites for my main hobby, gaming. I had really no idea how to design websites other than knowing the basics (html, layout). I had a lot of experience with Photoshop, though. Having used it all throughout high-school as a gaming nerd online. 

After a few months of testing and playing around with Joomla, I got a really good feel for piecing together components, templates, modules, plugins, scripts - etc. So, I decided to maybe make a little money off of it and I posted ads on Craigslist. The first few months were awesome - my posts were very personal, and at this time I didn't have much competition.  

Every new website that I built for local businesses was a new website that taught me something different. So, while I wasn't a real coder by nature, I did learn a lot about editing php, css, html, etc. For the next 2 years I supported myself by posting my freelance ads. Most of the people I worked for were just... assholes. But I had no idea what I was doing. I just hoped that they wouldn't call me out for not being a real programmer.

As time passed, I started making my own designs in inDesign/Dreamweaver, but I found that working alone made the process much more difficult. I didn't have enough training to get a degree and thus get hired in-house. Where my old turn around time was 1-3 weeks @ $600 bucks, I was now spending 2 months on a site and I was still only making $600-$700 bucks.

So, I went back to editing templates. I joined template clubs and edited them to the point where no one would notice. And still, I don't mind. I've learned that templates are just a structure - once you modify it enough to be unique, you've gained your goal. Anyways, I stopped freelancing for a year and worked as a video editor (friend got me that job, learned a lot, too). 

Fast forward to this year after we got laid off and my only option was to freelance again. This time, though, I wasn't freelancing. Well, I still am - but it's not how I advertise or market myself. I created a unique company name and licensed the DBA. I created my own brand identity and I speak as though I work in a team. I have created policies, rules and started to study business. 

I employ a project management system for clients, and I am not afraid of saying no to a job. I no longer bend over because I don't have to. I have contracts that they have legally agreed upon. I **act** like a big web firm and thusly I am treated as such by my clients. I advertise my company on my car and I have an 800 number that is very unique to my business name. 

I understand how the idea of labeling yourself as a freelancer seems more appealing to both you and a client (they think you're easier to get along with than a company - and cheaper). Which, hell - you just might be. But, with this comes them screwing you. ""Yeah, that nice freelance guy that we hired who was willing to bend over backwards and make pretty absurd compromises for me won't mind... you know, not getting paid. He's a cool guy, he'll understand.""

If you advertise yourself as a cool, easy going freelancer - then you must reel that in some. You cannot be afraid to set policies and deny jobs. You have to know what you can and cannot do and express this to your clients right up front. Everything MUST be in writing. Never give over control of a website until you have received all payments. Never host the test site on their server - always on your own. 

Take 50% up front encase (as they so often do) your client gets over it and just walks away. Anyways, you know... I am one guy - and I enjoy working for myself. If I can make $500-$1,000 off a website, then that's awesome. I use open source CMS's, and 3rd party components - but come on.. who doesn't these days? You know damn well that in order to custom create and develop a full featured CMS and software, from the ground up, you'd need a team of guys, or 5-6 months, at well over $30k. 

I market myself to small business owners who don't know much about the internet, want to get online - but don't want to spend a shit ton of money. So, I fit right in. If they come in expecting a full blown highly dynamic website, I can give it to them. But, if they come in expecting 100% custom code - sorry. I don't have the time or resources (Even if I had the knowledge) to do that and still be able to charge you $1,000.


So, in closing - learn on your own terms, and study each website you visit. Look at what you think they do wrong, and improve. Don't be scared to use open source components - I often purchase modules and components and their licence rights if the project deems it. It's a time saver, and a cost saver. If I pay $50 for an AJAX contact module with file upload capabilities that works across unlimited domain names - I can make my money back in just one website. 

Anways, get a DBA at legal zoom. Create your company, act like a company, and people will be less likely to stand up to you. If you come off as just some kid fresh out of college looking to get your feet wet, then you'll continue to get those bartering offers (wanna trade a site for some speakers?) or you'll continue to not get paid, get pushed around, etc, etc. You know what you're doing, they don't - that's why they come to you. They might act like they have it all figured out (yeah so, like - most websites are templates and templates cost like $100, so build me an entire site for $200) but they're just trying to low ball you. Even IF they have some understanding, they don't have the time - they run a business. They don't want to hire a new employee to design it in-house. Also! Never, ever, ever take one of those options.

I once fell for the trick of being hired on as a freelancer to build this company a website, and after I had quoted them they offered to hire me on full time. ""AWESOME!"" I thought. Well, hired at $10 an hour seemed pretty legit to me - I had a ""real job now""  I thought. Once I was hired, I went right into building the website, but this time I was their employee so I was on their terms. I actually ended up putting the website together in 2 weeks, and then I was fired for being 2 minutes late from lunch. Yeah, I knew what had happened. My initial quote was $2,000 at the time, and in those two weeks they had paid me around 600 bucks. I went in thinking this was an opportunity to grow, but they just wanted me on their terms at a low price.


So, like I said - fake it until you make it. If there's one thing I learned in the Army, it's fake it until you make it. Fake the Funk also works. Don't compare yourself to other web designers; many have been doing this for years. Yet, they don't accept small jobs, and that's your niche! Go after mom and pops - but understand that ma and pa are penny pinchers, and you must, for the love of god, set your policies and rules right up front and do **not** differ from them. Once you give an inch they will take a mile and make it into triathlon. 

Hope this has helped some people.

**EDIT**: Seriously, I cannot stress enough how you must enforce your confidence and dominance to your clients. So many of my clients learn from me once the project starts. You want to be sure that you do not give away too much information about your development process. Knowledge costs money - and the more you give to a client, the less they will rely on you. I've made the mistake countless times of explaining exactly how I do something and then the client will turn around and say, ""Huh, now that I know - why do I need this guy?""

If you have a client who likes to chest bump, ""Well I read this and this on a blog, so yeah..."" then simply tell him that he hired you for your services, and you appreciate the information but your job isn't to mimic everything that another website has **unless** you agreed to do that at the beginning (in writing). I don't know what it is about web design, but the clients man... they start to learn off of you, and then they want to become part of the process and design through you via proxy. I'm not a god damned UI. They seem to always want to change things and I'm sorry, but I just don't do that any longer. I even break down software pieces into packages.

If they want a video player added on, $100 bucks. I'm not selling them the player because I didn't make it. But I am selling them the installation/configuration. So, let's say my client wants to add some video about half way through the project, I tell him ""go to my pricing page and look at how much that costs."" It saves the hassle of confusion. It's a lot of work to break down packages and set pricing limits, but you have to weigh all that out in your mind.

So, make this known at the beginning. Your years of experience should not be over-looked due to trends or ""what they want"". Would you throw a splash page on a website in the year 2011 if they asked you to? I hope not. 

Use your knowledge to make money, don't give it away and just like all other professions, stay current and up-to-date and always assert your dominance as knowing what the hell you're doing.",,False,,t5_2qhs9,True,,,True,t3_jod31,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/jod31/stop_freelancing_and_create_your_own_company/,

I live in the USA, am in my 40s, and now do PHP freelancing (senior-level, quality work), WordPress custom plugins and themes, advanced CSS, advanced jQuery, some limited web design, and web design chopping/slicing. I was charging no less than $250 per project usually, and my average project cost was running around $1500. I've been in business as a freelancer since 2006, and was a programmer since the 1990s. I also have gobs of Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PostgreSQL experience, so I've been called in for performance troubleshooting gigs as well.

It used to be that I could put out a tweet or an ad on SitePoint to get gigs, but no more. Now I get dead air. The only way I'm surviving is through word of mouth, where clients tell other clients. And more and more of these clients are realizing that they can get a lot of work done on sites like fiverr.com.

I avoid sites like eLance and oDesk like the plague because when I tried them I found that Indians competed too harshly with me, saying yes to everything but then letting customers down. Still -- customers went with them instead of me because they charged less. Or, the customers were getting spaghetti code (something I hate!!!) and not knowing better, and then left wondering why it was going to be expensive to upgrade their software with new features. The other thing about these sites was that one bad client can ruin your entire profile, and these sites favor the clients more than they favor the consultants. About 50% of the sales leads I get are from a mix of bad clients, strange clients I can't work with, or cheapo clients -- so, I knew that I'd never survive and my reputation would be ruined if I tried eLance or oDesk. Meanwhile, I can't charge enough.

I charge $50/hr. That's a fair assessment of my services because I always do my best. As well, I solve tremendously complex problems, do incredible troubleshooting that few others know how to solve, and build complex web apps in a short period of time. I strive to be the best in my game and I produce readable code, use a minimalist MVC that accomplishes a lot but doesn't confuse clients who sort of already know PHP and want to tweak, and I avoid spaghetti code at all costs.

We all know that there's no record of what is said during a phonecall - and that any contracts and whatnot have to be written down.

However, for most of us, emails serve as a records of a contract - an offer, an acceptance, a price, and indication of costs etc. - especially with people we already have a comfortable rapport with.

However, something that transpired recently made me sit up and take notice.

I recently had a bad experience with a previously good client - our relationship went sour and I had to get legal to get paid.

During the process, however, I noticed that he would call me up much more often to talk - micro managing details, often from a car phone (which always annoys me because they can't really give you the attention you need, and they always seem to ramble and are never quite on the ball).

I would notice that I would email a question and get a phone-call response - at the time I didn't think much of it, because I thought we had a good rapport, and sometimes a phone-call is better.

This is a warning sign!

Some things need to be done over the phone - but some things need a paper trail.

Whenever you talk about costs, or anything involving nature of the job - get it in an email, do not settle for a phone call.

If the client is legit, as simple ""hey, could you respond in that email so we both have a record of what we've said, as my memory is shit..."" or something. 
Or after a conversation, summarise in an email and request confirmation; ""just so we are both on the same page, could you confirm you want me to do xxx, for an extra yyy"".

And make sure they reply.

Luckily for me I had enough in my emails, but it was a real struggle - and as I went through my history looking for clear details, I found a lot of emails from me asking for confirmation, or sign off on things - and a lot of things from the client listing of amendments and changes; curiously without the usual ""that's great, but we just need you to.."" or ""excellent, although the client has asked if we wouldn't mind...""

**So tl;dr** - if you notice clients almost always want to go through things on the phone, and they seldom reply to your emails confirming costs and whatnot - take that as a warning sign, and make an effort to pin them down EARLY. Before you have wasted your time. It's on thing to not get paid for a job, it's another thing to turn other work down - as you're not getting paid twice.",,False,,t5_2qhs9,False,,,True,t3_1c5zar,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1c5zar/theres_no_such_thing_as_a_phone_all/,

To summarize the events so far: last October, a former client refused to pay me for work I had completed (a little over $3,000) as well as $2,500 for lost wages due to canceling a scheduled work week with about 6 days of notice (as opposed to our earlier-agreed-upon 30 days - a necessary lead time as the work was being done about 400 miles away, and I needed to book hotels and schedule my life around being on location for about 5-6 days a month).  

After trying to collect from her for about 3 months, I filed papers and brought her to small claims court.  Our first hearing was early March, and I was (overly) prepared. I brought print-outs of every agreement we had made, copies of invoices and receipts of payment, and even some pertinent email exchanges.  After waiting at the court for about an hour and a half, our case was called... and she promptly asked for a continuation.  The judge, without second thought, granted it to her and gave us a new hearing date of today (May 23rd).

I will not speculate as to whether or not her reason for getting the court case rescheduled was legitimate.

So today, I went BACK to court.  I presented my case and evidence to the judge, and the client presented her side.  Thanks to advice from the last thread, I was pretty well prepared for how the trial went down.  I probably shouldn't get too much into the ""he said, she said"" details, but suffice it to say I had an answer for every one of her accusations with evidence to back up my claims.  The only evidence she brought was the first invoice she ever paid me (which I had brought copies of, as well).

After about 15 minutes of hearing our case, the judge ruled in my favor. The defendant was instructed to pay me for the work performed and to pay my legal expenses. I was not awarded the lost wages money because that had not been clearly spelled out in our contract.

The journey still isn't over because now I have the arduous task of actually collecting the settlement from her, but I feel I have learned a lot of important lessons on the way.  Chiefly:

1) Always have a signed contract for work performed.

2) Keep organized records of every transaction and agreement.

3) For each contract, spell out EXACTLY what the deliverables are and make it clear EXACTLY what you need in order to create those deliverables.

4) The court system can be your friend if you are in the right and have evidence to support your claim.

I wanted to thank you all for guiding me through the process a few months back, and know that because of your help, I sleep easier (and slightly less poor) tonight.

Also, I'm aware this is only one side of the story but my side is all I have :)

About a year ago I started to do some work for a guy who runs a company in, let's say, Spain. He wanted a store built ASAP because his previous developer had ""ripped him off"". I completed this job on New Years Day with many late nights and hassle (such as being expected to be answering skype calls 24/7). Anyway, after this, and to my eternal regret we began talking about a new project. It was a somewhat complex site for a client of his in, we shall say, New Zealand.

This project had basically no spec. There were also no contracts involved. Over the months that followed we were bombarded with new features, changes to existing features, etc etc. Over the length of the project to date I'd estimate the site has changed in it's entirerty maybe 2 or 3 times over. In addition to this I also had to build 9 other sites for the ""NZ"" client (which were completed) and an ecommerce store for another client of the ""Spanish"" guy.

Recently, the ""NZ"" client has become increasingly angry at lack of progress and things came to a head when he made direct threats against my life and those of my family. He does have shady connections where I am (UK) and I don't consider it an idle threat. The guy I was working for basically told me to forget it and carry on working - as the police couldn't protect me. I foolishly carried on for a bit longer hoping to make these threats go away but just recently, the ""Spanish"" guy I'm actually doing the work for and I had a conversation about deadlines. He asked for one and didn't like the answer. He ""suggested"" his own and when I told him I could not guarantee that, he totally flipped.

Now, the ""Spanish"" guy is threatening to sue me for all the money paid, all costs for a new developer to redo the site, his lawyer costs plus $10,000/month for the past 14 months for money he also claims to have lost. He also says he has asked his lawyer to pursue me on criminal charges as he considers failure to complete this project to his liking is fraud. In addition, the ""NZ"" guy wants $20,000 off me within days or he will follow through with his threats.

In total for this project, I have maybe received £5,000 while the balance was due on completion. The site is probably around 90% done at this point.

To be clear:
The guy who is threatening me is NOT my client. He is the client of the guy I was working for.
There were no contracts in place for ANYTHING, nor were there any specs and certainly no mention of compensation or penalties.

The threats I received are with the police but I'm aware they will probably do nothing about them.

I realise there is no substitute for legal advice but atm I cannot afford any. I guess I'm just looking for some general info on whether I am totally screwed here. Am I on the hook for $100,000's? The threats of violence is something else entirely which I understand cannot be solved here.

I'm sorry if this comes across badly. I'm totally alone here and I have no one I can talk to. I hope by writing this to at least get a few things off my chest and if possible a little reassurance. Even if it happens that I'm totally screwed, then at least I can have an idea of what I may be facing.

Thanks.

&gt;I had thought of having you radius the points on the arrowhead, so that the arrow becomes a subliminally suggestive phallic symbol - sex does sell, you know.  But let's stick with the serious modifications, for the moment.  Though, of course, I wouldn't object if, when the final product is completed, you made up a layer for such an arrow, and substituted it for the current arrow.  Just for grins.  Who knows, such a subterfuge might increase sales. I mean, look at MacDonald's twin arches.  What better subliminal ""let's eat"" icon than a set of boobs?

In that time I have been working as a contractor and not had much free time and wasn't sure if this website would actually get much of an audience since the other sites are so big.


So without the fear of anyone else stealing my idea and doing it themselves I will give a quick proposal here and it would be great to see how much interest there is.


It seems nothing has changed in 2 years to make things better considering one of the sites has this on their homepage ""Only pay freelancers once you are happy with their work""!! That needs to stop.


So my website will be called Fair Freelance, I have registered the business and domain name. It will have the standard features of searching for jobs and posting jobs.


But I wan't it to be heavily moderated by admins (me at first) and the freelance community through admin tools and a voting system (inspired by Reddit and StackOverflow) for the community.


An example, you see a job asking ""Build me Facebook by Friday for $50"". Well if the admin tools havn't caught it first, downvote it.


All posts, bids and users (freelancer or client) will have up and down arrows next to them. But if you down vote you can provide a reason why you did.
E.g. Illegal, Spam, unrealistic price/time, bad client etc


So say you are a client and you get a bid that says ""I can do this, PM me"", downvote.


Bids are public, so if you see a bid where a client is asking for a complex e commerce website and someone bids for $30. Down vote and state the reason as ""price unrealistic"".


Now what is the point in this? Well hopefully we can educate clients to value our work and they will start to understand how much time and money your skills cost.


There will be thresholds to only show bids/posts etc that have a certain score. This will get rid of most of the crap while you are looking for good work/freelancers.


There will be voting rules built in to reduce spam, manipulation or bots etc.


Clients or ""freelancers"" who get such a bad score can look to be penalised or banned. We don't want people trying to undercut each other either.


Also want to be able to have contracts on the site when a bid is accepted and realistic negotians of payment, so you could get a percentage paid up front and then something else on delivery stages etc. This is probably the hardest part to get right since it is real money and can't have any room for mistakes.


It might be good if the community can help out with disputes also. Say client doesn't want to pay for deliverable because they don't think it's worth it. Or is this going to far?


Just with these mechanisms the site will probably never have as many jobs or users as the big names but we can start to have a place to go to find quality clients and quality freelancers that all understand each other.


So I'll leave this here and see what interest I get. Feel free to add your recommendations for features or whatever.


I am a .NET developer and will be able to build this. Will get a designer in to make it all look good. My weakness here would be on the buisiness and marketing side. Legal aspects like the contracts would need help and getting peopel to the actual site.


The only real way this site would work is if we all work together and do a small bit when you are looking for a job etc and help educate the clients.

What options do I have?",snowcase,30,1,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1df1tn/client_has_requested_more_than_originally_agreed/,"[Update here](http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1df1tn/client_has_requested_more_than_originally_agreed/c9qcr4v)

**Background info:**  
Started communicating with a company to do PSD to theme conversion. They sent me the layout, we discussed it over the phone and in emails and agreed upon a set number of hours. We signed an agreement which specifically stated hours of operation, fees for working outside those hours, anything outside the original agreement would be billed accordingly and they do not own or have rights to use any work I've done until I've been paid in full. We also did not include a deadline. I get a deposit of 50% of the original agreement. This was about a month ago.  
  
**At the start of the project:**  
They requested the work to be started on a Monday and be completed on Friday. I told them I had other clients but I would do what I could. Then I get the actual designs which are obviously more than we had discussed. I make this observation known multiple times.

**During** (11 business days total)  
Client requests immediate response to emails, calls and chat messages even though they do not respond until well after my business hours much of the time. For example, on Friday I sent out a list of questions for them to answer and I do not hear back until late (11pm) Sunday night with a request to respond by 8am the next day. Monday I wake up to multiple emails and chat messages (before my operating hours) asking if I'm working and when I'll have the project completed. This has happened multiple times.  

Multiple additional changes have also been requested putting the project at about 125% more than originally estimated. The additional changes are functionality based which we had discussed would already be done by their team at the start of the project. I make these observations known.

**Final straw**  
I tell the client that I can no longer work under these circumstances and they're taking valuable time from my existing (read: paying) clients. I tell them that our agreement did not include a deadline and that I was not on call. I also did not appreciate the communications outside my operating hours nor the numerous changes and demands beyond our agreement. This was after an email I received at 9pm requesting, yet again, a response before 8am the following day because their delivery date for the client was the 1st and I was supposed to have all of this completed before then. Which is not what I agreed upon.  

He says I'm being incredibly unprofessional and my invoice was out of line. I reminded him of the terms in the agreement we both signed and the numerous things he's done that I would consider unprofessional. He refuses to pay the invoice stating that the work is not completed. I again remind him that my end of the agreement was completed at the end of the set number of hours we agreed upon.

I just checked the site and he's using my work without my permission. I sent him an email simply stating that I saw he's using my work and that he had no right to until I was paid for my work and then copied the section of the agreement that stated that. No response.

***TL;DR***  
Client signs agreement without deadline. Turns out they wanted much more than original agreement. Work goes more than double the original estimated time. I tell them I no longer wish to work with them and send them the invoice. They refuse to pay even the original agreement balance and are now using my work without my permission.

**Options?**  
They are located a few hours away from me in another state. I've documented everything I can. I don't want to get a lawyer involved but I will based on principal. Is it worth it or should I file with their local small claims? Is there anything else I can do to persuade them?

Usually, an invoice costs me a total overhead of 1.95 to 26.95 depending on amount (I throw out Amazon Gift Cards to clients who spend a certain amount.)

Sometimes, a deadbeat shows up and refuses to pay. Usually they're really late pays, and the letters they get from ZenCash scare them to the point they pay, costing me 2-5 dollars. 

But this guy. Its 34 days past the 90 day mark. He's changed phone numbers 3 times, changed his address (His corporate offices are no longer where the State says they are, and he claimed he never was there.), and uses a 1-800 number that redirects to a cell phone. 

ZenCash / United Recovery finally found the guy today, and he tells the CSR that he's never heard of my firm, never heard of me, doesn't owe anything, and even better... He has never received an invoice. 

So, being the nice person that I am, I sent United emails where he goes on stating that ""I just need a little more time,"" and 'I understand I owe you."" and my favorite: ""You're gonna send me to collections over  $XXXX bucks? Fuck you.""

M. Night twist - On Wed, I rushed my husband to ER for fever and abdominal pain. He didn't need surgery, but admitted for an infection. I was up all night with him in the ER bed listening to the codes and crises. My perspective changed quickly. Life and love above all else.

Emailed client in the morning after getting no sleep for 36 hours. Bad call. I should have stayed silent and let them find me. Client gave me a choice - either remain ""on call"" for them when they need me or be fired. I was happy to be fired. By that point, I barely knew my name. 

Story ended well - My husband is resting comfortably at home. And I can focus on him, rather than this client.

People from all walks of life understand the desire to start a business. My old place of work has about 300 employees and I am not joking when I say everyone from the President and his wife to the maintenance crew tracked me down last week and wanted to talk about what I was doing.

[http://bensgigs.com](http://bensgigs.com) is a service I run that scours around looking for freelance leads and emails them to you according to keyword criteria and a learning engine. 

It's used exclusively by redditors as far as I know, and about 250 use it today. We finally took it out of beta and introduced some pricing, but there is still a free level for those of you who want to get a few leads each day.

Sorry if it's poor form to post this, but I just want everyone to know. Someone I spoke with last night is making about $700 per week from gigs secured using the service and I had no idea! That made my day. For me personally, this has been my only means of income and marketing for the past 5 years.

If I can help any of you out, I hope I do. And if even 10 or 20 of you subscribe at some level, then I can afford some reddit advertising. But wait, why would we want to let the cat out of the bag? :)  Don't subscribe!

**tl;dr: Let my gig aggregator system work for you**

**edit** Yes I know you could build one. Trust me you don't want to. Also, I'm traveling today so if you do try it out and anything goes wrong, sit tight and I'll assist asap.

**edit 2** Hmm, so I'm back now and I see that there were some issues with today's harvesting. I'll take a look at it tomorrow.

**edit 3** Ok now things are working once again. Maybe better than before. If you need any help adjusting your keywords/filters, just ask. I also adjusted the pricing structure slightly based on feedback from some of you. Now the free level is limited to 5 days, after which you must sign up. 5 days should be enough to tune the keywords enough to convince yourself that it works :)

That word is resinating with me at the moment thanks to losing a bid towards a lower priced company. I was contacted last week to ""rush"" a website out the door just so they could have something online within a week for some event (but complete the entire website within the following 3 weeks). I offered to include SEO, a firewall, backup system and logo design on top of the design and content insertion for $1,400. After spending over an hour on the phone with the man and countless emails later they say, ""We can get this project started fast if you agree to $1,000.""

I know what I'm worth, and it's more than $1,400 - but this was a Craigslist prospect, so I knew going in that I'd be low-balled, so I replied that we lowered our price to $1,200. Still. Not good enough. Finally I replied back that we WOULD be able to finish the project and have a front-page working and up by the 1st week for 1,000. However, we would have to scale the scope back by a week, thus making it three weeks. 

We needed to do this so that we could fit in another project and not take away the quality of it. So, essentially this guy was getting our work for the price that he wanted in a timeframe that we wanted with all of the bells and whistles which we threw in. I just received a call (nice of him) telling me that they'd decided to go with a lower bid. So, after letting this dude know what I could offer him, wasting my time and finally working down to his low-ball price at HIS terms, he stills screws me over.

I'm happy that this fell through. I refuse to work with someone who will haggle over $400, then $200 and then once you submit, he just turns around and walks off. Be happy that bids fall through sometimes. Would you REALLY want to work for someone who low-balls the shit out of you? One of the worst parts of freelancing can be, and usually is the various personalities that you end up working with. You can really tell a lot about a client by just how much they initially haggle and how much creative control they seem to ooze from the start. I'd rather work with someone who is easy going from the start, and although still questions our pricing doesn't try to haggle with us as if our skill-set is just some common skill that anyone could learn.

Remember!! Price what you feel you're worth. If your clients could do your job then they would NOT be looking for you. Be fair and explain your price-points, but do not secede unless you feel that you can still make a profit and if the client seems easy to work with. There is nothing worse than being paid pennies just in order to be controlled by a Type-A personality who tries design through you via proxy, as if you were Photoshop.

Suddenly policies changed, internal readjustments in their organization, who knows – they decided they don't want to pay an external person for graphics any more.

But now they want my source files. Hundreds of Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign files which I created to generate jpegs and PDFs for them. They think they can use them to repurpose my art without paying me. Nobody there is a graphic designer, not even close, but they claim to have the software.

I never made those files with the intention someone else should use them. I did not bill with the advance knowledge they were going to demand the files and take them over, either.

Also, many of the designs depend strongly on fonts I am not going to give them.

I don't especially want to piss these folks off, but on the other hand they've been pretty open about how they used my services for a year and a half and now want my work so they can cut me loose, so if I burn a bridge then so be it.

Too harsh?",hookedonwinter,28,5,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/lai4e/i_just_cut_all_ties_with_a_disrespectful/,"Back in December, I launched a client site to spec, on time, and with scope creep. It's a Joomla install with a bunch of very custom components and a Google Checkout e-commerce process.

By February, the extra requests were getting to be too much and too invasive (OMG I NEED A TWITTER BUTTON RIGHT NOW!), so I offered a retainer for ongoing work. Retainer deal was a minimum of 10 hours a month at a little more than 15% off my normal fee. The client denied, and 4 days later requested 10 hours of work, and when I quoted my normal fee, demanded my retainer rate. I fired them. It wasn't worth my effort.

When I ended the relationship, I found them a replacement for ongoing maintenance work. The replacement was at my level, and I trained him, and offered any assistance he might need. The client used .6 hours of his time.

About 6 weeks ago, I was contacted by the client. They had let go my replacement and hired a local designer to do the dev work. A designer who had no dev experience besides basic HTML and CSS. The client demanded that I train this designer. I talked to her, asked her a few questions, and we determined the work was well out of her reach. I did the small dev work they had requested, sent an invoice for an hour of work, and described the type of developer they would need to continue.

A month later, neither payment nor communication happened. I sent this email:

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I'm emailing everyone I've worked with on this project, as I'm not sure who still receives these emails. 
&gt;
&gt;The attached invoice was sent 9/4, and was viewed 9/6. Reminders were sent 9/13 and 9/23. The invoice was then again viewed 10/3. It is now 10/8, and there has been no communication in regards to this $90 invoice. At 10/19, there will be a 5% fee. 5% of the ongoing balance will be added every 15 days until payment is received. 
&gt;
&gt;Please advise as to the current status of this invoice. Thank you,
&gt;
&gt;PJ

A week later, 

&gt;It has now been 5 days since my previous email, and over 5 weeks since my original invoice. I have given enough notice and enough time to allow for all foreseeable reasons and excuses for this very small invoice to be paid. I have received absolutely no communication from anyone regarding payment. It is now my belief that you, as a company, are intentionally ignoring me and are refusing payment for my work.
&gt;
&gt;This bridge is now burned. I wish you the best of luck in finding a developer to work with you, to maintain an e-commerce site of considerable complexity, and to deal with the inherit issues of that complexity and the lack of consideration of a small business. My code shouldn't ever break, but if it does, or if you desire to build on top of it, you may not contact me for development work nor any consulting. I am personally offended by this latest interaction, and have no desire to continue this relationship.

I can only apologise how long and ranty this post is but I'm quite upset.

So, the background: I'm a WordPress developer. November last year, a contact who had been doing some associate work with a reasonably large agency called and asked me to re-build their site - he provided HTML/CSS from a design someone else did, I turned it into templates and some custom functionality, turned it over to the client for content and to polish off final bugs once they'd populated it. While I'm doing this I do a rescue job on another site of theirs, again Wordpress, adding some functionality and fixing things where I could. I bill for this and hear nothing.

At least three months and many follow-ups later, still no content, still no payment. I'm just about to cut my losses, bill for the cost minus a day (for the bug fixing I was yet to do) and chase the well overdue invoice when someone new calls. She's just been hired as a digital account manager. Hates the design of the site I built. Pretty much accuses me of being a terrible web developer because it doesn't look like the PDF she was sent of the original design; I explain I built the Wordpress templates from HTML and CSS I was given, and it actually looks exactly like them. Tells me she doesn't trust me because there had to be bug fixes on the other site. I Explain what HTML and CSS are and how they're different to templates, and that it was me *doing* the bug fixes on the other site - I didn't build it. Ask for my overdue money.

She pays what's due on the rescue job, and that's great, and then says they're getting another designer to do a reskin on the original site and would I build it?

Now, I owed the original bloke a favour, and the people I'd dealt with so far had been very nice, if a little overworked and slow to pay, so I said as long as the functionality would be the same I'd do a reskin and only charge the initial amount plus an extra day - after all, the legwork was done, and it was going to be a refresh, not a total redesign, and then I could finish it all and get paid, and it might open some doors for other work.

A month later and I'm introducing her to the designer I always use because her designer hadn't come up with the goods. Alarm bells ring even louder but we meet and she seems fine, her boss seems great, my gut feeling subsides. We discuss several other exciting projects.

Design starts. Every design is rejected, changed, rejected, changed again: and the brief/feedback is awful - ""it just needs more pop"", ""make it more artsy but also corporate"", ""I'll know it when I see it"". The wireframes I help her draw up change and change again without consultation (the finished site - she has just realised - has no way to create sub-navigation after she removed it from the wireframes, design and spec!). I'm asked for several quotes for websites with no more brief than ""we need a website"". Questions about brief, tech spec, func spec, all ignored. The same happens with the designer - she's basically burning her company's money, and their client's money, and I start getting more and more uncomfortable. The designer starts charging for phone calls and has to limit her to an hour on the phone a day.

It comes to a head when she wants quotes for four websites to be built in two months and *that's the extent of the brief I can get from her*. Nothing more. 

On top of that I start building their new site and the signed off design and func spec are changed half way through the build, before I've even released anything. I email her boss and explain that I'll finish their site and after that nothing more, and that I'm worried this person is costing them a lot of money and her lack of understanding of the web is an issue. The boss forwards it to the person I'm dealing with. Things became a little tense at this point.

Finally - at least three weeks late after amend after amend, cutting short my only holiday this year, several all-nighters and a very annoyed girlfriend - the site is nearly ready to go live. I've lost at least a thousand (GB pounds) on it. I'm utterly ashamed of it: most of the custom post types and templates I created are pointless after scope changes, the back-end is needlessly complicated because of this, and the design has been diluted to the point that it's unrecognisable. But they like it. And it's done and I can move on to the frankly wonderful clients I want to work with.

Now they want a support contract. How do I say no? Morally, where do I stand on telling them they're on their own?

I got fed up with the grind from working full-time for someone else(great company though) and decided to leave and take some time off. 

A few months later, and I was contacted by some connections and now I contract out to two different companies on a weekly basis for enough income to keep me happy. 

I was stressed, tired, and felt like a slave to the man when I worked full-time, but now I'm loving the independence. I have FREEDOM! 

Yes, I still technically answer to people, but not in ways that will affect my happiness. For example, if I want to take the day off Friday to go out of town for the weekend, no problem!

I can work when it fits with my schedule, instead of fitting my schedule around work. It's awesome.

Here's why I'm asking other redditors for advice on what to do in order to alleviate from my current situation.  Over the course of a year, I've gone through a really, really......REALLY hard time (still going through big hurdles that would make you trip, fall and skid your head type hurdles), but I keep persisting with everything even though most people by now would have given up. Everyday, I push myself out of bed, sit at my desk, try what I can to bring in calls from the time I get up to 1 or 2 in the morning because I believe in myself and I believe that when I person works hard for something they will reap the rewards.

Some back history - From graduating from a less than great college in 2011, to being completely screwed over from shady employers (twice. it was devastating mentally and financially), nearly losing my home (very, very close to it) and as of now I'm pushing to get my business out there without much luck.

I love graphic and web design, it's the one thing I'm good at, it's that one thing in my life that I eat, sleep and breathe. I am so passionate about being in graphic &amp; web design that I just want to soak everything I can about it to become not a master in it, but the best designer I can be. With that, I have my own graphic design studio, it's just me and I have been struggling SO hard over this past year. I really need some advice on what bases I'm missing because I really feel like if I can try another angle or marketing idea that it will bring in the calls... something, anything.

Right now, I have a professional website as well as: 
* updating it with current designs, 
* blog post every week to generate interest, 
* I create free-content for people to download to bring people to my website, 
* business cards ready, 
* Linkedin, 
* Twitter, 
* Facebook Page, 
* Google+ page all centered around promoting my business, 
* post ads on Kijiji, 
* write companies, I do ""cold-call"" mail out when I can afford them, 
* I do a cold-call email marketing letter, 
* I actively look on the business registry to find new companies and contact them, 
* I drop off small postcard flyers to businesses in my neighbourhood, * I created a referral promo (10% off your next project for referring someone), 
* I contacted the local newspaper (I haven't heard back from them at all)

I read marketing books, I read books on SEO techniques, I search who my competitors are, I've started creating a marketing plan, I don't know what more I can do. I'm at such a loss right now, I just wish I had someone who is in the design field give me a good insight on now to hook clients and work with them; to make them see, ""wow... she's awesome, I can't believe I found this girl (yes, I'm girl.. don't be frightened) why is she not more well known?!""


I've even thought about buying ""Likes"" for my facebook page, because it doesn't look good to have only 8 people Like my page, when in reality I average 34 pages views a day and have a huge spike in traffic with I release a new post (upwards to 300 visits). But, I didn't feel buying Likes would be honest, you know what I mean?

With that said, fellow redditors.... what bases am I missing? How did you go from being a ""nobody"" to someone with a few connections? What steps did you take? How to did you form your marketing to entice customers to pick up the phone?

Here's my website: [inkedkoi designs](http://www.inkedkoidesigns.ca)
(maybe even Like my page, if woke up to even three Likes I would be elated. Seriously, like puppy with a squeaker toy.)

TL:DR; I need help, advice on how to get clients  to call in for work and to realize I'm awesome at graphic design; to see that my goal is make every client look great without thinking a graphic designer will break their wallets.

Note 2: I'm looking to get small clients, people who wouldn't have too many custom things required and can make do with simple hosting solutions.

I have two ideas but I'm not sure which is best. So any help would be greatly appreciated. My ideas are:

- Get **yearly-paid shared hosting for each client**. Ask them to pay me the year upfront and I renew the subscription. If a client doesn't pay, I shut down that subscription. This involves 100% work from my side and 0% work from the client. Unfortunately, it's also the most problematic if the client or I want to transfer work to some other developer. **Is this possible? How would I transfer the domain to his new developer so that he can point it to the new developer's server IP?**

- Have **the client purchase the shared hosting / VPS** and he'll take care of the payments. This involves 100% work from the client's side and I'm not sure if they should be the ones taking care of it. **Should I sit down with the client and walk him through it the first time and hope for the best? Would he give me his account's login/password?**

- **Anything else I haven't thought of?**

As for hosting, if I'm going for the first option, should I purchase shared hosting for each client, or should I go for a slightly more expensive VPS and have a bunch of clients share that one?

",delrazor,20,2,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/v0wuh/someone_i_hired_wont_fill_out_their_w9_and_is/,"Hey everyone. Complicated story here, but I'll try to keep it to the point. 

I hired a voice talent to help me out with a project last year. They did a great job and my client loved their addition to the project.  I paid them very quickly (pretty much as soon as the project was approved and finished)

We had no contract, they simply invoiced me when the work was completed. 

Well, I was just starting out freelancing and this was the first time I had hired a voice talent, so I didn't know that I had to treat them like a freelancer of my own. I figured I just paid for voice like I paid for stock images or music.  

Fast forward to US tax season, and I realize I should have sent them a 1099-misc form, because I paid them over $600 for the project. It was 2 different invoices, so I hadn't noticed that the amount went slightly over $600. I emailed them and told my situation.  Let them know that I researched the issue and I have until August to file a late 1099 with them and the IRS. I'll still be paying penalty on it, and they might too.  The research I did via the IRS website, showed that even though they did not have a 1099 from me, they should have had record of and claimed that income.  They did not. 

So I send them a W-9 to get their info. SS#, address, etc. 

No response. 

I call them up and they told me they just went through a bad break-up and asked if I could call them back in 2 weeks after they get their life straightened out.  Fair enough, we have until August to do this.  

I call back.  No answer and no return of my voicemail.  I email, nothing.  I resend the w-9. Nothing. 

Finally, I call their agent, who I did not work through with them, and of course their agent doesn't want to be a part of the situation, but agrees to send an email to them on my behalf through the agency. 

I just simply stated, I need you to fill out the w-9 so we can finish this issue and I can pay my penalties and move on. 

That was earlier today. 

Tonight I get a call/voicemail from them.  Stating that they talked to their accountant and to file all of the paperwork and pay taxes on the amount, it would cost them $400.  They said ""that's a lot of money, so if you want to continue this, you're going to need to send me $400 so I can pay that off, then ill send the w-9, since this is your mess up, not mine""

Everywhere I read stated that if you didn't  receive a 1099-MISC, you still need to properly account for that income on your tax return. 

Personally, I added the payment I made to them as a deduction on my tax return, and since I didn't have their info at the time, I just wrote their name in the slot. 

What should be my next move here?  I shouldn't be responsible for their accountant fee and penalties and tax, right?

How do I get their info to file a late 1099 with them and the IRS if I don't have a w-9 from them?

I want to just tell them they have no option to get money from me because it rightfully was their mess up to not include that income on their return.  But I don't know how that would solve anything.

TL;DR : freelancer won't fill out late W-9 until I agree to send them accountant fees and filing fees because they say it's ""my fault"" although law says they should have accounted for the amount I paid them anyway. What should I do?

Looking for feedback on feasibility, ethical implications, and the math involved.**



Hi, fellow freelancers. I work full time as a web developer and/or designer, but I also have ambitions of freelancing full time and running my own business. To work towards this goal, I occasionally take on freelance work, as my free time allows. Over time, I've made it a goal to get better-budget clients, but most of the projects have been small, short, and low budget - not even close to enough to let me quit my day job. Before this latest project, the biggest budget I could get was $1000, for a mostly simple WordPress site. Since there was very little content and a minimalist design, this was enough to keep me in budget time-wise, since I was only billing $40 per hour at the time. In my city, successful freelancers often make $60-75 per hour or more, and that's where I'd like to be.


Earlier this year, a friend referred me to someone looking for a Web site and offering a budget of nearly $2000, also for a Wordpress site. I figured this was a great opportunity to raise my caliber of client, so I based my estimate on billing $50 per hour. Sure, what this client wanted would be more complex than the previous Wordpress site, plus we'd be designing a ""placeholder"" page to put up on the new domain while we were in development, but I figured double the budget would be enough to cover that.


I ended up being wrong in my estimate by orders of magnitude. By the end of the project, the billable hours were almost 4x what I had estimated. It wasn't caused by any huge unforseen problem or delay; I really just had not been realistic about how long things would take me to do. I had made the mistake of putting wishful thinking into my estimate, telling myself it would work out, just so I could secure this seemingly lucrative opportunity. Another factor was that this particular client wrote me e-mails far more frequently and with more questions and concerns than had any other client I'd ever had, and my time billed just to look into something for them or explain something to them was tacking on time as well. I had burned through almost the entire budget just to finish the placeholder and start the full site design; still to come was finishing the design, and all of development and QA. 


I could see this coming early on, and was rather conflicted on how to deal with it, since the client had already made it clear they weren't very flexible with the budget. Though we had a contract that stated that the amounts noted where only estimates, not quotes, and subject to variance, I knew any overage of the estimate was not going to go over well, and was unlikely to be paid at all - especially if the only reason was because I had screwed up in estimating. So, I made the decision to not bill the client over the estimated budget, and simply eat the loss to my time and profit. At first, I figured this would just be only a couple of hundred dollars less that I would make - no big deal, a lesson to be learned. But, as the project went on and billable hours kept piling up, it soon became clear that my actual ""hourly rate"" was approaching minimum wage levels. 


And that's not even the worst part. I had planned from the beginning of the project to hire an outside developer, a friend of mine who's just trying to get a start in freelance web work and is entirely self taught. I figured if they were only charging $35 per hour, but I still charged the client $50 for that hour, minus the offset of time spent managing that person, I'd have even more profit margin. I knew my friend's skill level well enough, from having helped them with code problems, saw that they had at least some professional projects under their belt, and I figured they knew enough to do the grunt layout work, while I handled the Wordpress aspects and the JS. Turns out, I had also done a bad job estimating their skill level - they had serious gaps in their knowledge from being self-taught, needed a lot of hand-holding, and when they did pull things off without my help, the code was often sloppy enough that I had to take the time to school them on best practices and have them re-do it. They did me the favor of not billing for most of the mistake-fixing, but even still, I had to pay them for slow and sloppy work. 


The worst part is that the poor time estimation also carried over to the outside developer's work, but they still billed all their hours, and I couldn't have really justified not paying them because I had wrongly estimated. So, the amount I paid them actually exceeded the amount I made from the client by a few hundred dollars, which I had to pay from my own personal savings. In the end, this project -lost- me money instead of making me money. Needless to say, it's been a distressing few months, and I can only be thankful for the fact that I'm making such horrible business screw-ups while I'm still working full time, and while losses sure are deeply upsetting and keep me from having nice things for a while, at least they're not keeping me from eating and paying my bills.


However, by a happy coincidence, I was reading an amazing book during this time that shined light on the reasoning for my epic failure: ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman. http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637/ In short, this book explains how the workings of our brain make us susceptible to many kinds of fallacies and biases that get us into all kinds of trouble. One chapter explains something called the ""planning fallacy,"" wherein our brain applies best-case scenarios, optimism, and skewed perceptions when making plans. He even tells of an example he went through personally where his team experienced a similar level of epic failure working on a project to write a psychology textbook.


The real kicker to the story is that someone on their team had brought up, in the first few months, how other similar projects he knew had only ever been completed about 40% of the time, and those that had been completed took about 7-10 years. Their project was only a few months in, but they had only budgeted two years. The smart thing, of course, given this revelation, would have been to abandon the project or change the estimated timeline. Yet, even these neuroscientists, who you'd think would be some of the most logical minds, basically shrugged off these inconvenient truths, and figured their estimates were still sound, and that their project would be the exception to the rule. Of course, they were quite wrong. The book took 8 years, and was never even used after completion.


The solution the author proposes to combat the planning fallacy is to always look at the hard data first on projects like the one you are planning, what those projects cost and how long they took, and base your planning and estimates on that, not just on your feelings and guesses. Even those with plenty of professional experience in doing those kinds of projects are still subject to bias and wishful thinking. Perhaps, if I had been able to look at data about other freelancers' Wordpress web site projects, and see how long it took them, I would have seen numbers that were more realistic than the ones in my head, and would have known to not take on the project without a much higher budget.


The problem is, as far as I know and can Google, no such data is publicly, or centrally and easily, available. But, I have the crazy idea that, if it seems feasible, I could create some kind of user-generated database for Web freelancers to share this kind of data with each other. Now, I can see many potential problems with this. Of course, the amount of time one person takes to complete a Web site is based on a lot of variables - complexity of the features involved, amount of content, complexity of content, their own years of experience, familiarity with the technology, subjective mood or just their discipline level. Now I'm no statistician, but it seems to me that with enough data, the Law of Large Numbers and enough qualifying supplemental data would give us a number that is a reliable enough starting point. 


In addition, a user-generated database could also ask for information on these variables to supplement the timeline information. I.E., a user could enter the number of hours their project took, number of pages/views/states, approximate total word count, their years of experience, their level of familiarity with the technology on a scale of 1 to 10. Still, that barely covers all the variables put into something as complex as a web site, is still quite subjective, and doesn't guarantee that such times are accurate (as freelancers who don't measure their time well could enter data that doesn't reflect their actual project time, even if they have the best of intentions). However, I feel that in an open source project, new ideas could be generated to improve the quality and reliability of the data. 


Even though I'd expect such a database to be anonymous, I feel like one of the reasons this hasn't been done in the past is that it somehow feels ethically wrong to share this information. If such a database takes off, it could remove the stigma if the benefits become apparent. Most of all, I feel that -some- data is better than -no- data, and that I'd have to start -somewhere- if I want to be able to reliably circumvent the planning fallacy in myself and others. I know that the planning fallacy is a very common problem in the freelancing world, and I would like most of all for no one else to ever have to experience the painful failure and loss of money that I went through.

for his interpretation of events to be factual, somebody would have had to steal the check from my mailbox (which i have been checking daily since the 16th, looking specifically for this check), and figured out a way to cash it without my ID. i really doubt that happened, but i admit that it's logically possible.

We exchanged a few emails; according to his website, his company emphasizes business ethics, social justice, people over profit, etc. He's also willing to pay me more than the rate I quoted him.

The problem is that he asked me to complete a background check before starting work. I'm not worried about the background check itself (my record is clean), it's just that the form he's asking me to fill out asks for my birthdate, social security number, and driver's license number. I met him on *Craigslist*, mind you, and our correspondence thus far has only consisted of a few emails back and forth. He hasn't asked for my resume or samples of work, even though I offered.

I realize that background checks are often required in the application development world, so this is not totally unusual. And to be fair, he's given me no reason to doubt his trustworthiness (except for not asking for resume/samples of work). Still, I'm nervous.

My question is if anyone is aware of a scam going around like this--offer a job to a freelancer, require him to complete a ""background check"", then use the information to take out loans against them?

I rarely have an entire day off; even if I only need to work an hour, I still feel like I can't relax. Often that hour breaks up my day. 

I started to meticulously track actual work hours on Harvest and was shocked at how little productive time I actually put in. According to Harvest, I've actually worked ~57 billable hours since June 1, which works out to ~2.5 h/day. I should be living the dream, but I feel like I'm constantly struggling to meet deadlines and do the things I want. Those hours are so incredibly spread out. It's frustrating to look at that clock and think of all the stuff I could have done if I just woke up and did my 2.5 h plus extra so I could take the next day off. It doesn't help that my work is tedious and not creative although lucrative. Truthfully, I dread work but see it as a means to an end, which I am not achieving.

Is 2.5 h/day incredibly bad? How many hours of actual work (i.e., not including breaks, lunch, etc.) do you put in a day on average? How many days per week?

Any advice on how to get work out of the way quick and painlessly?

**EDIT**: Today was a better day. I finished all my immediate work from 9 am to 2 pm with 3.75 billable hours + 1.25 hours of non-work activities including no surfing.

Marketing is hard, especially if you're working on your own.

Once I have convinced myself, convincing the client is easy, but I still have to find the clients.

So I propose that we have a discussion about how a freelancer can (and should) market themselves.

**Experienced freelancers** - what do you do to get your name out there? What works, what doesn't, and what tactics should you avoid at all costs? What do you do differently now that you're established?

The project stalled for long periods of time first due to waiting for the designer (hired by my client) to finish, and then waiting my client to supply content. When the design finally made it to me it was clearly far beyond the scope as explained to me. Essentially, I was expecting it to look like the stock theme but with different colors/logo/etc. Instead it used a similar layout, but changed everything else. I brought this up during a meeting and my client's rep said she understood that it meant I'd be going over the estimate.

Fast forward to yesterday where I'm finally nearly complete after my client supplied the content. I sent an invoice for the completed slips and mentioned the current running total on slips that were still open. My client flipped out because the total is more than double my estimate. I pointed out about the theme and how I had discussed it during a meeting. Now they're talking about canceling the project.

The contract only stipulates an hourly rate, and the estimate was in a separate document which isn't referenced by the contract. They claim they don't have the money, and I keep pointing out that they exceeded the scope of the estimate.

What it comes down to is this: I didn't make enough of a fuss when the scope changed, and I didn't get any acknowledgement in writing. Am I just out 20 hours of work?

I think I have finally decided to make the leap from my full time, cushy, well-paying, immensely boring and unrewarding job as a software engineer for [redacted] (quite a large company...willing to bet you own some of their products) into freelancing/product development. I have done freelance work throughout college, and my intent when I graduated was to start a development studio with a few friends (we had a couple developers and a graphic designer). However, we dabbled into the job market or some stayed in school for further degrees, and that plan never happened.

My long term goal is to develop a few products of my own and grow a software studio focused on unique products that have meaningful impacts on peoples lives (none of this 'X plus social!' or 'AirBnB of bullshit!' fad stuff). I have a few ideas I've already started working on MVPs for with a friend. However, I'm not the type to blindly jump into anything, so I don't think I can see a path to make a leap into working full time on our ideas until they are generating enough income to support us. I'm also not really in a part of the country where I can seek out venture capital.

Ergo, my short term plan is to start a development studio that takes on freelance and contract work, and use the revenue from that to support product development. I've been marinating on the idea for quite some time now, and actually have 2 contract projects I'm splitting with a friend (who does this full time currently and would become a partner with me) that brings in pretty significant side income. If i was working solely the 2 contact projects full time, I'd be pulling in more than I currently do in my 9-5. However, they only have another couple of months left on them so I can't take them into consideration as income in the future.

I think I've rambled enough to give you a feel for my situation :). I am planning to take the dive into freelancing and working on my own products the last quarter of this year (due to existing obligations for my current job), giving me about 6 months.

1364403163.0,16,self.freelance,1b4agx,3rd party company is trying to take more profit from my source files. Negotiation advice?,ajrdesign,17,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1b4agx/3rd_party_company_is_trying_to_take_more_profit/,"So I've been doing some freelance work for a company who hooks me up with clients. They pay me about 70% of what they charge the clients, which is great, they bring me clients with little effort on my part and they take a cut off the top.

A problem has arisen when a client has asked for the source files of one of the projects I did for them. I haven't done this before so I told the client that I charge a lot for my source files and what they needed it for.

They were somewhat vague, saying they wanted to embed it on their website (I then supplied them with a web ready version) as well as print it out (I had given them a PDF of the file which is printable). Then they also said this:

&gt;""In the contract it says the source file can be purchased for $500.""

So at this point I was like ""Oh I don't remember agreeing to that or reading that in anything I agreed to"". So I decided to revisit the 3rd parties documents to make sure I was clear. The only thing could find anywhere was this:

&gt;Do I have to deliver source files when the project is completed?
&gt;A: Generally no. But if a commissioner does require this, you may be able to request additional fees.

So I told my client to contact the third party that got us together to get clarification. They thanked me and said they would contact them. About a day later I get an email from the third party stating:

&gt;""The client has reached out and paid for the source file. Can you provide it and then also add $250 to your invoice to us so you are being compensated for it?""

Now I figured I'd be okay with handing over source files for the $500 that the contract said (Apparently, even though I cannot find any such contract) but I don't feel like this should be an opportunity for the 3rd party to skimm half my profits for something like handing over my intellectual property when the contact has already been made and they are getting paid for that. 

So how do I go about negotiating this? 

I don't want to start accusing the company that they are taking profit where they shouldn't because they do bring me a fair amount of clients that are generally good but I also don't feel right about them taking half of me handing over source files to a client, which they are providing no value to.

1363836325.0,16,self.freelance,1aplyb,Deluxe Maintenance Contract,Sam_Son_of_Sam,16,0,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1aplyb/deluxe_maintenance_contract/,"I'm currently deciding on the best way to offer ongoing maintenance to clients who I've just completed a website for. I have an idea that I'd like to get some feedback on.

The idea is to offer clients 3 options, and let them choose which one they like the best:

1. Client requests maintenance work, I do this and then charge them for the hours worked at my regular hourly rate.
2. Client prepays for maintenance, essentially buying maintenance hours in bulk. They purchase say 5, 10 or 20 hours of maintenance, with a bigger discount on my hourly rate depending on how many hours they prepay for. When they request maintenance work, I do this and then subtract the time from their prepaid hours until they run out and they have to purchase more.
3. Client goes on a 'deluxe' maintenance contract, where they pay a flat rate per month and get the following:

* I do any maintenance work requested with no limit on the number of hours per month
* I provide a guaranteed minimum response time of, say, 48 hours, meaning I will begin working on their request within that time or earlier
* I provide the client with fortnightly (or maybe monthly) website analytics reports
* I automatically update their CMS when updates are released, as well as any other software on the hosting server or website
* I do nightly backups of their website
* I manage their email accounts (e.g. add new email accounts when requested)
* I add new features/tools to their website (e.g. if I make some nice new feature of some sort for another client that would be useful for them as well, I will implement this on their site too)
* I provide training on various parts/features of the website (e.g. teaching the client or their staff in how to use the CMS)

Option 3 would need to be fairly expensive, but I'm not sure what a good price for this would be.

So what do you think of offering these 3 options to clients? Is it a good idea to provide them with so many options in the first place, or should I try to bring it down to just 2 options, or even offer only 1 option? Are there any other things I could offer as part of the deluxe maintenance option to make it more enticing?

**EDIT:**

So based on the feedback I've got so far, I've now thought of a simpler approach that I'm leaning towards. I would offer the client just 2 options:

1. Pre-pay for maintenance in 10 hour blocks at the regular hourly rate.
2. Have us on a retainer, where the client signs up on a 12 month contract that includes 10 hours of maintenance per month, with a 20% discount on our regular hourly rate. The hours would not roll over from month to month, and if they needed more than 10 hours in a single month, any extra hours would be charged at our regular hourly rate. This retainer would include the benefits listed above (minus the email management).

I request full specifications of what he wants. He wants a translation app showing translations between English and a local dialect, and create the app giving him daily builds which he was happy with to see progress. 

Skip forward to app completion, by this point I have been paid, Apple reject it for 3 reasons:

1. It has a bug in
1. It mimics the homescreen layout
1. Its not useful or does not provide lasting entertainment

So I done the following that took about 4 days: 

1. Fixed the bug
1. Changed the layout
1. Added an extra feature, a translation soundboard. 

However it has been rejected again because of the following:

1. Its not useful or does not provide lasting entertainment
1. Confusingly similar to Apple product or advertising theme

It is quite niche, but does feature a lot of translation content along with a spoken soundboard for popular phrases. And I cannot see how it looks like anything apple has done that other apps dont do already. (scroll view, title bar, navigational bar at the bottom...)

He is a very nice guy, but has come back to me wanting to make all sorts of changes (without paying) to make it appropriate on the app store.

Paypal might shit the bed on this, need alternatives.


Here are the facts:

I share a paypal account with my wife.

We started the account at address X, we moved to and currently live at address Y, and get our mail at address Z.

She is the main user, but I accept payments to my email, and we have an additional debit card with my name.

We used to live at address X. Last year, we moved to address Y. Address Y was my late grandmother's house, she was ill at the time and went to live with my parents (address Z) before we moved. When she moved there, my dad forwarded all the mail going to address Y (our house now), to address Z (their house).

Because the mail is forwarded, some things dont get forwarded. Namely mailed debit cards. Because of this, we changed our paypal address to address Z, so we could receive mail from it. This was all fine and good until I had to get my wife a new debit card issued. Her application was held and our account put on limited status. We have 15 days to produce a photo id with her name and address. Problem is, we dont have utility bills addressed to address Z.

What we will do monday, is try to get paypal to let us change our address in paypal to address Y, and obtain a photo id for this location. (and get my dad to stop the mail forwarding of course)

But for shits and giggles, since paypal is our primary source of access to funds, lets assume that paypal will shit the bed and destroy the account. (I did have the presence of mind to empty it prior to this, given their fickle nature in regard to other people's money).

* Do not fall for the sunk-cost fallacy. The more time and energy I sunk into these guys, the more I felt like I couldn't give up. Worse, they kept pulling me in by reaffirming they wanted to hire me, then pushed me away by going back on promises (see below). 

* Promises are worthless. By my count, they reneged on tentative agreements **3 times**, sometimes halving them. I asked for something, they said ""sure, that's good,"" and then came back with a whole song and dance about HR's policies, my experience, their limits etc. after they reaffirmed they picked me over lots of other people (who I bet walked away).

* Be aggressive. Push for the sale. Set deadlines. In the beginning, I was patient; they took their sweet time. The moment I started saying how much I wanted, what I can do, and when I want to meet, they responded. If I had just set a deadline and demanded a definitive ""yes or no"" answer, this might have been concluded in weeks, not months. On top of that, we would have started our relationship with far less strain. 

* It's not usually a good idea to trade price for volume, unless you really need guaranteed income. I'm not a wholesaler/manufacturer; I don't physically make anything; thus, my overhead is low. ""Orders"" don't matter; invoices matter. On top of that, do you really want a client you don't have a great feeling about to have a document that guarantees them at least half of your working hours for months or a year? For a mediocre rate? I could potentially lose the opportunity to take on work from higher-paying clients; that, or I'm going to be burning the midnight oil.

* People hide behind bureaucracy. HR is always the scapegoat.

* Learn to say ""no"" and when to walk away. If you can't afford to lose a sale, then you're going to be taken advantage of. Stand firm. In the final hours, they got me to drop my price. I could have said it's non-negotiable (because you already agreed to it!). Also, it's often a waste of time to offer endless alternatives. When I definitively said no when they tried last-minute to cut the minimum hours, I didn't offer a solution. They came back with one that I chose to accept.

* Don't be afraid to ask. In the end, I got about 90% of the hourly rate I asked for. Truthfully, I believed it was asking a lot. I mean, what person my age makes that much per hour? Truthfully, it was fraction of what I should have asked. Realistically, I can never expect to raise this rate.

* They need you, you don't need them. I learned there is far more opportunity is my field than I thought. They picked me out of many other providers. I still had other clients.

* You're the expert. Act like it. They had never hired someone for my position before. They didn't know what to expert or what they needed. Again, I waited for them to work it out instead of saying ""look, I've done this for years; here's how it works..."" I approached it like a job interview, not a business negotiation.

* Be prepared. Have set rates and terms. Know the answers to likely questions. Be ready to justify your prices. Most importantly, know what to ask them. At our first meeting, I should have demanded to know what HR's policies for hiring consultants were. My contacts had no clue, so it was a surprise to them when HR (rightfully) said the agreements they made were just not possible. In the end, it turned out that all they had to do was ask HR for a simple 2-page form. **We could have reached an agreement and signed papers in minutes, not months**.

Ultimately, I got the deal *I asked for*. Man, this was some learning experience. I hope no one else goes through this. I promise myself I'll never do this again.",,False,,t5_2qhs9,False,,,True,t3_1a6ye5,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1a6ye5/conclusion_i_spoke_too_soon_my_dream_contract_is/,

I quoted them initially for the work (breakdown on paper) and they seemed happy with it. 

The job was complete about 6 weeks ago now and they got an invoice straight away giving them 30 days to pay. I've only started chasing them last week and they said ""i'll have it by the end of the week"" and to ring them back on Thursday (last). So i ring them back on Thursday but get no reply.

Today, I'd intended getting a lot tougher and threaten to pull the site if i wasn't paid by the end of the week (I also host the site for them and haven't been paid for that - it was part of the quote). But no answer again, so I left a message insisting they get back to me asap. 

The reality is this isn't a massive amount so I don't need or want the hassle of going legal on them. The only reason i took the gig in the first place was because of a mutual connection who i'd done work for in the past (and had no problems with). 

I'm just wondering what reddit would do in this situation? Or are there any tips i can employ to get what i'm owed other than threats and tough love?

*Update: We have movement. Client returned call and is apparently signing cheque as we speak and i'll be able to collect it this evening. No mention of missed calls or ignored calls so until i get it in my hands and more importantly cleared in bank account, i'll be taking nothing for granted.*

*Update 2: The plot thickens. I ring the guy that i'll be collecting check from assuming I just have to arrange a time to collect and he asks me how much it is and says he'll ""have it ready first thing in the morning"". Face Palm. Sparks are gonna fly in the morning if still no movement.*

*Update 3: Another successfully answered call this morning and they've decided to do a bank transfer instead (makes more sense for everyone). At this stage i'm building up a nice paper trail too (had to send them account details and they've confirmed they received) so the money should be with me with me in a couple of days max once banks process it. If not, I've more than enough evidence to show they were leading me on and delaying payment they acknowledged they owed, so at this stage it's looking good for me.*

**Update 4: As of this morning, the money i was owed is now sitting in my account. Success. In summary, i didn't do anything other than bombard them with phone calls (two people within company) but had i given up after one or two conveniently ignored (non returned) calls, i'm pretty sure they wouldn't have paid.

I have savings but I don't want to factor that into this question really. I'm just asking how likely it is, in your opinion, that a good designer can pull in $1600 a month from websites.

Bob has a friend who needs a web site, call him John. John was very specific when he told Bob that he needed someone who was fluent in ""PHP, MySQL, etc."". A very typical combo, yet surprising to hear a client know exactly the technology they want used. However, he mentioned one aspect that threw me off and is really making me wonder if taking this project on is even a good idea...""the developer must work from my office until the project is completed"". I don't turn down at least talking to a person about a project if they're serious, but at the same time I don't want to wind up in a shit situation because some client is a major control freak. Not to mention I'm running an actual business here, with a graphic designer, a few devs, etc. I'm not just a single guy working on his own. There really is no way that I could see myself working from his office.

So my question to the more experienced Reddit community is: Is this the potential for a nightmare client? Is there anything that I could ask him that would expose the telltale signs of one?

tl;dr: potential client wants me to work on his project from his office until completed, is this a sign of a nightmare client?

**update:**

so I did meet with the potential client, and he kind of backed away a bit from his initial statement of 'working on site' however, i feel that he more than likely will pressure the person who will take the gig into being on site. This particular web app, etc. has been in the works for well *over 2 1/2 years* and still isn't finished...Nearly the whole project has been outsourced to India for the coding at a rate of $10/hr / programmer. The client didn't want to pay me even 1/2 of my going hourly rate, wanted someone who would basically work in excess of 30-40+ hrs per week yet not be an employee...I know the IRS rules regarding this stuff, he needs an employee, not a freelancer. Plus, I'm usually unwilling to work for anything less than my going rate as I have plenty of people who will pay it no questions asked. The funny part of the whole situation, is that he has a ""friend"" who has a web business in town in which he claims doesn't charge as much as me (i'm skeptical of this though), and hasn't used him as much because of this rate. I'll be professionally passing on this gig and focusing on continuing to build my business and work with clientele where there is a better mutual understanding.",,False,,t5_2qhs9,True,,,True,t3_r4y8m,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/r4y8m/is_this_the_potential_for_a_nightmare_client/,

That's what I did and it cost me about $300, but in the end that $300 was a payment forward to my future freelancing strategy.

I developed a lead generation tool that scrapes Bing for keywords and footprints, like ScrapeBox. This was all wrapped up into a Wordpress plugin with shortcodes. I had the plugin installed on a temp Wordpress site at my own web server, but my client was taking extra long to review it and insisted that I install it on his live Wordpress site so he and his partner could ""just review the tool as it will exist in the members area of the site"".

In this freelance frontier, I was open to taking some huge risks to break in.

Needless to say, my client's partner ""broke his neck"" or some crap thus avoiding the review and payment owed to me, so I told him I would be disabling the code until his partner returned, which I did. There's a good chance he still has a working version of my code through a backup, and I don't believe his story one bit because I did a background check on him afterwards. Turns out he's one of those guys who releases hundreds of websites cloned from the same content to spam the search engines with ""fake SEO"" then ""flips"" the sites to people for a high price who naively think these websites have good SEO/traffic/userbase.

Be it things like jQuery plugins I haven't used before, or how to make custom fonts appear correctly across different browsers, things like that.

What I'm wondering is, how much 'learning time' is it fair to include in my paid hourly rate? How do you separate them?",,False,,t5_2qhs9,False,,,True,t3_phrh7,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/phrh7/new_freelance_web_developer_question_how_do_you/,

I recently set up a weather feed for a client's website using Weather Source A. 

After a couple of weeks, the client started complaining that the temperatures shown consistently hotter than reality and that they wanted to switch to Weather Source B. Without looking at the code, I quoted them a price. They gave me the green light.

While I was switching the website's weather feed to the new provider, I found a bug in the Weather Source A code. Instead of outputting the current temperature for the day, it had been outputting the day's maximum temperature. This explained the problems the client had been experiencing.

I was at a fork in the road:

1. Revert my changes, fix the bug, and not bill. 
1. Continue with the switch and bill them for it. 

I decided to take the low road and continue with the switch. I regret this decision.

A couple of weeks later they started complaining about Weather Source B. They said the temperatures were off again. As it turns out, Weather Source B just sucks and there's really not much I can do about it. 

I have to do something about Weather Source B. So I have another fork in the road:

1. Revert my code to the old Weather Source A code, fix that bug, and not bill for any of it: I would really like to do this but I think that would reveal my previous lie.
1. Find a Weather Source C and get that working: 
But then I feel I would need to bill for the second switch, which makes be feel like even more of an asshole than I've already been.

Not much is really at stake. It took under an hour to make the original switch.

What should I do? 

P.S. ""You should have taken the high road to begin with"" is unfortunately not possible, so please spare me those type of responses.

### EDIT

I pulled the trigger and it went great. Thanks all for your suggestions. 

## My E-mail

&gt; Hi [project manager],
&gt; 
&gt; After e-mailing [Weather Source B] another time and getting no response, I figured I would take a deeper look at the old [Weather Source A] code because it seemed like a more fruitful path to walk down than waiting for [Weather Source B] to fix the problem (why should they hurry?).
&gt; 
&gt; I found that my old [Weather Source A] code was carrying a bug. As it turns out, the temperature reading I was displaying before was the ""highs around 70 deg"" reading. Which totally explains the problem [website owner] was reporting.
&gt; 
I've fixed it and I think the temperatures will be a lot more like reality. By the way, [website owner] might be interested to know that reading are being pulled hourly from this airport:
&gt; 
&gt; [link deleted]
&gt; 
&gt; As this turned out to be a bug, I'll waive my fee for the switch to [Weather Source B].
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,

&gt; Thanks  SO much [throwaway23783489]. I will let [website owner] know.

1374359747.0,14,self.freelance,1ipw6k,How to protect yourself against perpetually 'on-hold' projects due to client neglect?,OnceInABlueMoon,14,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1ipw6k/how_to_protect_yourself_against_perpetually/,"Currently working at an agency, considering jumping into the freelancing world. 

One thing I have seen happen every so often in the agency world is that projects go into a state of *on-hold* or *dead* due to client neglect. 

The most often scenario is that we sign on a client that we will design and develop a website for but they are going to write their own content or hire a copywriter to write content for them. They never get content done (or they do get it done months or sometimes years later and want us to honor an old contract). 

Sometimes its an e-commerce site that fails to give us product information, or a business that never sends us the photography they promised, or sometimes the business just falls off the Earth for months and they come back half a year later. 

If I do decide to become a freelancer, these scenarios could be damaging. If I have completed the site but the client has not completed content writing I need to know I will receive final payment for my work even though the site is not launched. 

Do any of you run into situations like this? What do you do, if anything, to protect yourself against projects that lag due to client neglect? 

Here are some of my ideas. 

* Receive payments by milestone. Basically, require payment to begin the next phase of the project so that I know if the client skips town at any point, I have already been paid up to the last phase I completed. 

* Add a term to the contract that protects me from client neglect. I still need to iron out the specifics of this, but I want to be able to terminate the contract if the client ceases to communicate for an unreasonably long time or holds up the project due to non-communication, failure to deliver content or photography, or any other reason. 




**EDIT:**

I think I figured it out. I will ask for payment in three phases. This is crafted to put less emphasis on the project completion, the standard 50% up front and 50% upon completion, IMO, leads to the possibility (inevitability?) of some clients delaying completion of the project and not paying the final bill. This three phase formula means it is clear I get paid for all the work I complete. 

Phase 1 Design: this phase will need to be paid before beginning the project, this will also be the down-payment that is required to start the project

Phase 2 Development: since the ball is in my court during this phase, payment for development will be required after I complete this phase

*At this point, if the client neglects the project or bails on it, they will be obligated to have paid for all the work I have completed so far, which is more than the standard 50% up front, 50% upon completion.*

Phase 3: Content, CMS Training, Site Launch: payment required before site can launch


**EDIT 2:**

Maybe I am over thinking it and should just adopt a 50/25/25 payment strategy. 50% up front, 25% upon development completion, 25% upon project launch",,False,,t5_2qhs9,1374431447.0,,,True,t3_1ipw6k,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1ipw6k/how_to_protect_yourself_against_perpetually/,

Long story short, I ended up a 3-month renewable contract guaranteeing 20 h/week for a discounted hourly rate.

Renewal time came, and the client asked that I work for the same hourly rate with *zero* minimum hours, which will probably amount to 5 hours/week. I thought no way, and asked for a substantially higher hourly rate, ready to negotiate.

However, they firmly had the upper hand and they knew it. They flat out said no and take it or leave it. I am going to accept because (1) I need them for my CV/testimonial, (2) it's an *okay* rate and I can still make a good chunk of money from them, (3) I have hours I need to fill anyway. Ultimately, I think I will be able to charge future clients way more because of what I'm doing today.

In short, we went from part-time job, to part-time contract, to per hour *for the same hourly rate*. I clearly see how I backed myself into a corner negotiating and how they used my inexperience to take advantage of that. I highly doubt I will ever be able to raise my rate with this client.

Lessons learned: 

* No discounts for volume, friends, trials, etc. Your discount is a grandfathered rate if I really really like working with you.

* Stand your grand. This is what I do, and this is how much it costs. Take it or leave it.

* Don't back yourself into a corner in the name of compromise. Give an inch, and they'll ask a mile. I made concession after concession while they made none.

* Take your time. They took a week to respond to me, I took a few days to respond to them. There's no reason to make decisions impulsively or based on emotion. This situation upsets me, but I believe it is right choice financially and careerwise.

* Get to the point where no client is that important that you tolerate them bossing you around.

* do you pay a monthly fee, if yes, is it worth it?
* do use the free account option, for how long? (also, which one?)
* does the time tracking option allows deduction of 'idle time' when you're away from the computer?
* is it just a timer app, or does it actually time specific use of programs (like photoshop, etc)?
* what programs have you used, and would or would not recommend?
* are you on a mac or pc? do you use the mobile version as often?
* how important is the invoice/billing option?

When I started pressing them to pay, they started to try and intimidate me saying that they could bill me $250/hr for wasting their time (ridiculous, I never agreed to hire them like they did me).

I am almost ready to hire someone to create/develop my website, but before I hire someone I have a few questions to ask.

* What information do you need from me when I hire you? For example, are there any specific requirements that you need from me? How exact should I be in my plans? Should I allow you leeway to be creative or have exact plans for each page?
* Do I need to purchase the domain etc beforehand, or is that something that is arranged as part of the package?
* For a very simple site (I'd assume no more than 4-5 pages), approximately how long is a reasonable time for it to be produced?
* For maintenance of the site, I'd be hoping to be able to do that myself, but I'd most likely need assistance/advice in order to do that. Would this be a problem? 

Thanks for your time, I really appreciate it. There may be more that I think of later that I will edit in if I can think of it.

How can I save it?,twelvis,15,1,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/19rqgh/i_spoke_too_soon_my_dream_contract_is_on_the/,"After 4 months of drawn out interviews, meetings, and emails, it had all come together: we came to an agreement about the price and working hours (20/week) under the explicit agreement I could continue freelancing. The terms were very good for me and excellent for them. They agreed to my salary request without negotiating, leading me to think I had asked too little! I was already making arrangements to move overseas.

However, today, I was called by the HR department and told they could not offer a part time contract because of visa restrictions. Instead, they offered a full-time contract *for the same monthly salary promised for part-time!* Needless to say, I was downright insulted and frustrated after being strung along for 4 months. How can you halve an offer like that!? Out of principle, not financial need, I cannot accept being jerked around like this.

I need to decisively end this already and get on with my life. I want to give them 2 options:

(1) Hire me full time for the same hourly rate agreed to earlier and sponsor my work visa.

(2) Hire me as an outside remote contractor on an as-needed basis with regular virtual office hours and business travel as needed. No visa needed. This is probably better for them as they don't know how much work they'll need.

If they do not tentatively agree to either of these options within one week, I am prepared to walk away. However, I am scared my prices are somewhat high. I am having a hard time coming to grips with the fact that I'm a skilled professional with a rare talent and that I deserve a relatively high salary, higher than most of my possible coworkers.

Do you think this is an acceptable plan of action? Or am I being too greedy and brash?

So my question is - how do I handle this? I've taken to telling clients up front that the price I quote does NOT INCLUDE PROJECT FILES.  But they almost always ask and act pretty miffed when I refer back to that original agreement.

Should I just hand them over? Who owns the project files when the video is completed? Should I charge a fee to hand them over?  Looking for feedback on the matter!

I've put in quite a few hours on this, and the further I dig in to it, the more I realize that there is even more work to do.  It's quite obvious that quite a few junior developers worked on it, as no standard practices have been followed.   You can't even compile this code in Visual Studio, as some genius thought it would be a good idea to mix VB.NET and C# in a plain old Web Site non-project.

I've been able to make some good progress with it, and I've even documented all my changes.   I completely redid the back-end system from scratch within a couple of weeks (a great achievement), but was told to use the current code base for the front end system to ""save time""  (against my judgment).  I'm about 33% complete with the front end, but it will probably take another month or two to finish everything up and test it.   I'm discovering a lot of hard-coded crap that would be better suited for the back-end, so I'm pretty sure I'll be revisiting that and making changes.

When I first started this project, no deadline was given.  I was told to dive in and start cleaning up, fixing, adding, and moving code.   I stated my hourly rate, even gave them a discount, and they accepted.  Heck, they charge the client nearly double for every hour that I work. 

Just yesterday, the person I'm working with asked me to reduce my rates.  He wants to pay me about a third of what my current rate is, which has already been discounted 15% from my usual rate.  Turns out, they made big promises, telling the client the system would be done in 90 days.   Now the client is threatening to back away from the project.   They even stated that they are looking to hire an internal programmer to do the work instead.   It's taken me at least 2 months to half-learn the system, so I really don't understand why they think this would solve anything.

Anyway, what would you do in this situation?  I'm getting a lot of ""promises"" for more possible work in the future, but nothing is set in stone.   I'm having a really hard time justifying reducing my rate, as I could be getting business from other, higher paying clients.

Normally, I charge a piecemeal rate so no one knows how much I actually make an hour. However, they insisted on an hourly rate, so I did the math and asked. My services ain't cheap, but they are absolutely critical and hard to find.

So they hemmed and hawwed at my heavily discounted rate even though I told them if they hired a company, they would be charged **300% more** and that that very same company would in turn subcontract to me!

If millions and your entire reputation are at stake, how do you convince the client that you're worth it? 

How do I convince clients that my work effing matters and that it has extremely high value relative to the cost? In reality, I would have liked to charge twice as much as I'm getting. Am I just greedy or overvaluing myself?

",DrDiv,14,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/zq8un/freelance_web_designerdeveloper_no_idea_what_to/,"Hi everyone. I've been learning and doing website design and development for the last three years. I would say that I'm fairly good at both the speed and design with which I create sites and products. I spend most of my time doing startups and project sites of my own, even though none of them really bring home any income. 

I really have been trying to find some freelance work lately, though. It seems like I came into a really saturated market with everyone and their brother able to slap together a website and sell it to someone for pennies on the dollar before I can even message them 'Hello'. I'm baffled as to where to go to next.Most of my previous clients have come from Reddit, Craigslist, or word-of-mouth, but I haven't had a single job in almost two months.

I have bills coming up that I desperately could use money for, and I don't know what to do next, the options that I've thought about are the following:

1. Scrounge for freelance work on sites like eLance and Freelancer.

2. Reply to every ad on Craigslist that I can come across.

3. I have a couple of WordPress templates that I've developed, I entertained the idea of starting up a template e-store, but I'm sure it would be overshadowed by TemplateMonster and ThemeForest.

4. Sell templates/tutorials on etsy and fiverr. This seems impractical considering just how much garbage is on both of those sites. 

5. Cold call businesses around my area who could use a website. This will result in long-term web design partnerships, but nothing that would bring me any money anytime soon.

I have a goal in mind down the road of starting up my own media firm to develop sites and applications aimed toward both myself and clients, but that's nowhere near the present considering my current situation. Any help at all for this would be extremely appreciated, and I hope this is clear and easy to understand, I kind of just typed out in a rant.

I am a freelance designer, working on a high profile project at an agency for a high profile client. Can't name names. 

The bottom line is this: the project is completely off the rails. It is being mismanaged from both the agency's end and also the client's end. We have an unrealistic deadline that isn't moving, and we are over a month into the project and are basically starting over because of the client pulling us in different directions.

On top of this, I've been thrust into a role I'm not comfortable with.. directing and managing the overall strategy for the project, when I signed on to be a part of the production process under creative leadership.

I have no real ""contract"" with the agency. My freelance agreement expired a month ago, they informally asked me to stay on through July and here I am.

I want to know if I can walk away from this project with no legal ramifications. I know it's hard to say without the details, but it is a project I see as being doomed to fail, and that I cannont fix by myself. Has anyone walked away from a nightmare project / client before? What are my options here? Should I man the fuck up and see her through?

EDIT: I want to add that I know walking away will burn a bridge, and that the industry is very small. I'm trying to weigh my options.

There are no co-working facilities near me, and I don't really want to shell out for office space just yet, so I was thinking a voice chat server might be a nice idea, if there are others in the same situation?

They're a small company of maybe 30 employees. Think ""The Office"", with a warehouse and a office bit. They were impressed with me because last year I saved their company from a an IT-related disaster, which their previous IT company had washed their hands of. That company went bust.

Anyway, when I started working with them regularly, there was a lot of work to do so they wanted me there for 3 days a week. They've told me time and again how much I've helped the company and generally made things more efficient. They are happy customers.

The thing is, for the last month, I feel like I'm being paid to be here just in case I'm needed. Everything is working fine and seems to be going smoothly. The office staff and warehouse staff all know the new IT systems and procedures and I just sit here... trying to look busy. Though mostly browsing reddit...

Work availability isn't great in the local area, but I feel like maybe I should move on to something where I'm actually doing work.

Whats the best way to say to my clients ""My work here is done"" without it seeming like I'm abandoning them. They really think they need me, but I don't think they do. At least not as much as they think they do. They'd probably be OK with me just being on call for emergencies and maybe a quarterly checkup.

What should I do? How should I explain this to them? Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? What did you do?

I know a lot of people who are starting out struggle to get any kind of exposure/build a portfolio. I wanted to see if there would be any interest in starting a Wordpress blog where anyone can contribute (and get credited for their work in any way they want to) so that people could use it as a part of their portfolio. You might be thinking ""I could do that myself"", but the thing is if a bunch of people got together to create a ""collective magazine"" type site, it would look a lot more professional IMO and less ""This is my webpage, here is my one example"".
I'd be happy to buy a domain name, host the blog on my hosting account, and then create logins/email addresses for anyone who might want to make a post to show off their skills. To keep it fair right from the start there would be a ""no ads"" policy (this isn't about making money, it's about helping people get exposure). I already pay for a professional hosting plan where I can host 25 separate domains (I'm only using 5 at the moment) and create up to 500 email accounts (I'm using something like 3-4), so adding another domain and creating some emails accounts wouldn't cost me anything (I'm paying for this for myself anyway so what I mean is that there would be no extra costs to me, beyond buying a domain name, which is so cheap that it's of no consequence as long as we don't try to get something really fancy). Also I have unlimited bandwidth and 100GB of media storage (which between all my sites I'm using something like 2GB - if I want to host video/audio I just use youtube or soundcloud).

To sum it up, this would simply be a place to post so that you can show prospective clients that you're capable of working remotely as part of a team and creating quality content. It would also be a chance for you to familiarize yourself with how to create content on Wordpress in a no-pressure sandbox environment. Heck, if enough people were interested maybe we could even ask the nice folks over at /r/wordpress to create a cool theme or something so they can show off their skills as well.

Beyond creating accounts, paying for the hosting, and making sure WP was always up-to-date and functioning I would be taking a very hands-off approach. I could create something like a ""contributors board"" using phpBB where the contributors can chat about what they're working on, etc. Again, this is not a money-making venture (for me or you) so you would retain all the rights to anything you post, and be able to remove it at any time for any reason.

So what does everyone think? Is this something that anyone would be interested in? Even if only 10 or so people out of the 9k subscribers here wanted to give it a try I'd be happy to set it all up.

So that's it, discuss!",,False,,t5_2qhs9,False,,,True,t3_1c3yux,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1c3yux/just_an_idea_to_help_freelancers_promote/,

For the background: I've been working with a Lawyer to get a standard contract and general terms written up for future client work, and the question about rates was asked.

""Normally,"" I said, ""I will charge $X/hour for regular contracting work, and $Y/hour for very short notice or emergency work.""

""All contacting work is worth the same amount?""

And that got me thinking: some stuff adds significantly more value for a client, and is much harder to do, where as other stuff isn't complex, doesn't add much value for the client, but needs to get done. Here's what I have been able to come up with so far for different rates:

* Standard Contracting rate.

* Emergency rate: Covers anything that would normally be done under the Standard Contracting rate, but which has been requested at very short notice. It will be higher than the SC rate to offset my own costs.

* System Architecture rate: Planning, designing, requirements discovery, and technical documents. This will be significantly higher than the SC rate because the value for the client is much higher for the time spent.

* Re-factoring rate: Cleaning out old code bases, removing old/legacy/un-used code, adding documentation, etc. This will be lower than the SC rate because it takes a long time, and is more of a ""long term investment"" type of job.

My buddy mentioned my name to someone he went to school with who is looking for a web developer. He wants me to create a basic demo of a few features of his site (login, signup, profiles, etc.) that he can show off at a conference he's going to in two weeks. He already had one developer write everything for him, but didn't document anything, so I have to start from scratch. As I have never done free lance work, I don't know what to charge. I'm curious as to what everyone else charges and what they would charge in this situation. I was thinking $25/hr, is this too low/high? Should I make the price higher because of the small time frame? 


EDIT: forgot to mention that he wants it done with Ruby on Rails, which I've never used before (Ruby, that is). I'm pretty confident in my ability to learn Ruby quickly, but it will take up time that could be spent developing.

I have a contract with their digital media dept. This Dept serves all these other department's needs when they need stuff like what I offer done.  The contract basically just outlines what my hourly rate is.

The digital media department basically acts as a middle man and actually often bills the other departments internally whenever they do something in house or outsource to someone like me.  

I'm generally friendly and on good terms with the folks in the departments I end up producing for, while my 'manager' contact in the media dept can be difficult to work with (my opinion, and other people's as well), plus they always express frustration on how much red tape there is to get a project or task through the digital media dept and to me.  They often specifically want ME to do something for them.  Also, my contact seems to put some effort into NOT giving me work (don't know if it is personal, or business), and work has been coming slower and slower from this company.

Some of the folks in the company have expressed interest in working directly with me.  I would love to do this, as it would likely mean more work from those particular people whom I enjoy working with, and I could more freely adjust my rates to suit their needs.  However I am worried that it will create a conflict with the digital media dept that I have a contract with, as I would basically be cutting this dude/department out of the chain. 

I am new to freelancing (I was actually full-time employed with this company for five years until recently), so I'm not sure how big of an ethical or even legal issue there might be with this.  People in the media dept that would think of me to give me work keep getting canned, and my point of contact doesn't seem to want me to have work, so I'm worried my opportunities will keep diminishing with this company unless I go direct with the people I have great relationships with.

If you have a blog or website where you promote your freelance services you'll get more traffic and potential customers if you optimise the site.

Some basics of SEO are:

* **Keyword research.**
Use [Adwords KW tool](https://adwords.google.com/o/KeywordTool) to find relevant keywords. Use those keywords whenever relevant in your website, but bear in mind it has to be readable to humans.
* **Page structure.** Use keywords in your page and blog post titles. Preferably have a few keyword matching categories in your blog.
* **Linkbuilding.** Do link building slowly. Don't submit to all places at once. Some places to get links are directories, guest posts, online profiles, friendly blogs.
* **Web analytics.** Check Google Analytics for link building ideas, potentially good keywords. Look which content is more popular and create more of that.
* **Content creation.** With only 6 content pages you won't get significant SE traffic. Post good content and post often (once a week at least).
* **Social media.** Promote your best content in social media for relevant traffic and links. Have good titles, good thumbnails, know the tastes of specific social networks.

And yeah I know some think search engine optimisers are evil (some of them are)... but keep in mind that at least 50% of all online traffic comes from search engines.

So shoot any questions or problems you might have concerning SEO. I'll do my best to answer all of them.

Firstly, I'm from a third-world country (India/Pakistan area) where paypal isn't available, so I don't have a lot of options other than elance/odesk.

My English is pretty good (e.g. finished elance's ""US English Basic Skills Test"", or whatever it was called, in less than 17 of the alloted 40 minutes, still got placed at the 99th percentile).

Of course, I don't know how much such tests affect a potential client's decision and how much a client will trust a non-native's English, regardless of his scores.

I'm wondering:

1. How much should I charge per hour at the beginning?
2. Around how much work would I have to do before, say, making $10/hr?
3. How much should I expect per hour, say, 3 months down the line?

Being from Malaysia, his English is not the best but has never been an issue. He's pleasant and pays on time but this recent project has me baffled. The client has requested 5 quizzes of 25 questions each be composed. My main concern is that the topics requested don't work in a ""fun quiz"" format but I'm thinking there's a cultural (I'm from the U.S.) divide here that's causing my ineptitude.

It started with:

&gt;Can we start on next project soon? This time, I want more spice! A lot more! Haha. It's for:
4 quizzes:
1. Wife Phobia - i.e.: his hands shake when his wife raises her voice, or His wife make fun of him in public and he just kept quite
2. Husband Phobia - i.e.: bruised face, or  she becomes intimidated or abnormally timid in the presence of her husband.
3. Identify Ass Kisser at Work Place - always sit next to boss/ laughs when the boss tells a joke - even a dry joke/ takes deep breath and says the air is fresh when the boss farts, haha :)
4. Do I marry Your Mom too? Everything has to be your mom's way? Your mom decide everything and we gotta follow what she says? Gotta cut the vegetable the way your mom does? She decides what dinner we'll have - every night??? I HAD ENOUGH!!! etc.

Sounds like fun? 

When I asked for clarification, this was the response:

&gt;Thanks for the work. For ""Wife Phobia"", ""Husband Phobia"" and ""Identify A Brown Noser At Your Workplace"", the questions are NOT to find out if one is afraid of his/ her own spouse.
They are to identify/ find out if other people (their friends/ neighbors/ relatives) are afraid of spouse. ""Is Jack scared of his wife?""  ""Is Cindy afraid of her husband?""  ""Is Mike of Engineering Dept a buttock kisser who loves to please his boss?""  
""Do I marry your mom too"" and ""Do I marry your dad too?"" are to find out if one marries their spouse and the spouse's mom or dad too. 
Some folks who are married found their mom-in-law telling the spouses what to do. It's annoying. Examples:
1. Don't buy light bulb brand A, cause my mom says it's bad.
2. Don't park your car in the sun. It gets dirty fast, my dad says. So honey, why not you move your car to the garage now? 
3. I've told you not to do your laundry on Sunday. My dad says Sunday is for family.
4. We must buy washing machine brand K cause that's my mom's favorite
5. You shouldn't apply for the managerial position. My dad says you should try a junior position.
6. Adding sugar to coffee is bad, baby. My dad says it makes men sexually less capable. You either quit it or move to the living room for a week.
7. My dad says man should do more exercise. So sweetheart, why not you exercise eight days a week? 
Hey, that's ridiculous!!! Shut up! Why am I listen to your dad or mom? DO I MARRY YOUR MOM (or dad) TOO? I HAD ENOUGH!!!
Hilarious? Funny? Painful? Does it bite? If you're a married guy with the experience, the above will come automatically. Haha! And you will now the pain. Just let me know if you need more info any time. Thanks :)

Am I off base here or can anyone prescribe a solution? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

I showed him two samples on my deviant.art page, and he said he'd be interested in hiring me. We agreed to $80 for about 8 small logos, the price being that small since he wasn't pressed by time so I wouldn't have to rush things.
He gave me specifications, his music sounds like Kavinsky, and the band name should look kind of like the letters in The Thing 80ies movie. The band was named after an animal, so if I could squeeze that in even better.

I gave him some samples, he picked the proposed styles out of the list, and waited.
Emphasis on ""take your time, mate, I'm not pressed.""

A week later there was a death in my immediate family. I was a total wreck for a week. After that I started collecting my life, and remembered I had stood my client up.

So I emailed him, apologized, said something personal had come up, and said that even though I can excuse my actions, there was no reason he should. So I said that if he wanted to find somebody else, no hard feelings. If he still chose me as the artist, I offered $20 off as a ""sorry note"".

He said it was okay, he understood, and insisted on paying me the full $80.

After that there was a constant tweaking period of fix this, tweak that, enlarge that, the usual.

All the while I was becoming weary about how I could ensure I would get paid after my work. after all, this was pixel art, I couldn't stick a watermark and leave the original art still recognizable, so I decided to give him the final products as medium quality .JPGs, so if there was no more tweaking he could send my money over Paypal and then I'd send him the originals on .PDF as he had asked.

He stalled, saying Paypal ""charges too much"", and that he'd pay through his girlfriend's PayPal account next weekend. He also asked for an extra pixel art sketch (a variation of one of the eight logos I had ready. I said okay and said I wouldn't charge him for it for being a good client, and I'd send it along with the rest as soon as I saw the money in my PayPal account.

All this happened around October, early November the latest. Christmas and New Year breezed through and no word from my client. I sent him an email a week after New Years asking if he was okay, he said he had pneumonia and he'll send me the money the coming weekend. I waited, and waited, and waited, weekend after weekend.

Two months passed. I sent a couple of emails, asking what had happened, and if he had any intention of paying he should say so, because everything indicated he was trying to scam me.

No response.

Shortly after I see a familiar post on Reddit by another user. Somebody asking for someone to design a logo for his band. I made an alternate reddit account and asked for more info to see if it's the same person.

I forgot about the alt account until today.

A month ago, I received an email from the first ""client"", saying he didn't like the tone of my last two emails, and since I never sent him the finals he didn't need to pay me anything (even though he had agreed on paying me first and receiving the finals afterwards), he had hired another artist but would pay me because he felt sorry for me wasting my time, after he returned from a band tour. I said okay, as agreed, when he sends me the money, I will send him the finals which have been ready from before Xmas.

He disappears again.

Today I open my alt account, and lo and behold, 4 months ago this mysterious person sent me info about his familiar project.

The name was different, but the music style was exactly the same eclectic mixture to not be too common, and the guy was also asking for a Kavinsky/The Thing font/logo/style.

**tl;dr** guy hires me to make logo for his band, disappears at the last moment, then possibly the same person tries to hire other people to make logo for same band, different name, without paying me.

Have a customer who's estimated personal worth is just over 8 million dollars. I know him personally, and we arrange a contract for me to do a little web work for him. I quote it out for him, and spend about 3 months on and off working for him, it's about 5 grand. He pays on schedule as agreed. Wonderful.
 Just as that job is a few days from completion, his asks for more work, just a rolling few gigs, he'll throw me some stuff and I'll knock it out. Same time table, only I didn't quote it, because he didn't know how much he was sending to me or what. It ended up being very diverse, lots of design work, a few wordpress set-ups. Another three months.

At the conclusion he says that's all he has for me, and he put a check in the mail. I get the check for 3 months work, opened it 20 minutes ago.

I had a lot going on, and while I enjoyed the course and seem to have absorbed most of the theory, I fell through with very little work and little technical competence. 

In the 4 years since then I've been supporting myself with a minimum wage shop job and trying to build up my design competence in my spare time with the aim of eventually becoming good enough to get a job in the field.

It's not going particularly well. There just aren't enough hours in the day and while I'm slowly getting more competent, I'm just not getting enough down time to get where I want with it.

I occasionally think about giving up and focusing on moving ahead in retail, but it's so soulless and what little progress I do make with my design work is too promising to turn my back on. 

So I had a thought the other day. 

Previously I thought it would only be possible to go self employed if I could reach a skill level that would guarantee an income that could support me. Say £10,000 a year. There's no way my skill set could touch that at the moment. Even if it could there's no way I can maintain a full time job and build up regular paid work that could come close to 10k

But I don't suppose I don't have to right away. I'd surely be eligible for Tax Credits if I couldn't generate enough income to support my self. It would be some close to the bone, frugal living and under no circumstances a long term business plan. But If I could generate only a  couple of hundred £'s a month at first, allowing for the income support to help pay the rent, then I would be able to spend some serious time advancing my technical and design skills to the point where income support would no longer be necessary. 

I've been trying to read around the subject but I struggle to find a handle on it all. Where do I start? 

I imagine I would have to set my self up as self employed and start generating income before I left the retail job? I would probably have to synchronies it all with the availability of tax credits and housing benefit as I don't believe you can apply for either of these at any old time.

So I've been busy brewing beer for my friends wedding and just thought it would be a nice surprise for them to show up with nice labels made up for them. There will be 4 different styles served so I need 4 individual designs. Each design doesnt need to be radically different, in fact, I think a theme between the labels would be pretty neat. Maybe same borders/color theme/font but different center image and obviously different beer name and style. I dont need them to be crazy ornate, just something nice and classy that will impress guests and be a nice surprise for the couple. Was thinking maybe vectorized tracings of their engagement photos for the center images. The labels will be on 22oz brown bottles. I could send the exact dimensions if needed.

If you could, please send me some examples of your work.

Not sure how pay would work. This is my first time commissioning an artist for something like this. Whats fair for a project like this? I not rich but definitely willing to compensate for quality work.

The wedding is on September 18 so I kind of need them soonish, hopefully that's enough time. I only plan on printing a few of each design. The beer will be served into glasses at the wedding so Im just going to have one of each bottle with labels on display and I'd also like to keep one of each for myself. If you know of any printing solutions for me, Im interested in that as well.

* He puts a message up on his website, blog and social media outlets explaining the situation. Everyone is understanding except for this one customer.

* Customer sends him a very abusive message about how long he is taking to complete their work. He forces himself to finish it, taking twice the time to finish it and adding a few compensation pieces in as well as an apology for the delay.

* Friend argues that the work is usual standard, they got extra stuff and couldn't help medical emergency stuff. Eventually my friend agrees to do the changes.

* Friend goes to visit mutual friend. Customer is at the same gathering. They physically grab my friend and scream at them. Friend is visibly shaken up by this incident.

* Friend finishes their piece and sends it back to them. Now they're demanding a full refund despite receiving the goods twice, along with extra pieces and amendments.

There are other reasons too, such as my boss constantly coming in high and/or drunk or hiring people who literally don't even know what their job is, don't have the right software, etc.
I take my career(graphic design) too seriously for this. I am passionate about design and cannot suffer here anymore. 
I have applied to many agencies and other job listings in the area and have had no luck... Either everywhere is looking for someone with more experience (I graduated college a little over a year ago) or just simply aren't hiring. 
My rent is fairly cheap, and I can make sacrifices in electricity consumption and eat a bit more frugally. I'm honestly struggling as it is now living paycheck to paycheck, so I feel that going freelance wouldn't be a major decrease in pay if I can pick it up.

Now, I have done my research and I realize how difficult this will be, but here is a rough outline of my plan, please let me know what you think.

- Take small jobs I can find.
Even the dreaded $50 logo craigslist post. While craigslist seems to be the basis of thousands of horror stories, I honestly have no chance at forming a financial safety net, and it's more of a desperate attempt to get some traction and some food in my stomach while I grow.

- Apply to listings on freelance websites.
I have researched and bookmarked a number of sites where consumers post listings specifically for freelance work online. I will apply to all of those that I can, again starting out small and trying to grow.

- Start a blog.
I have a domain name registered where I have my portfolio now. I would like to convert that into a blog to share my thoughts on design. I have heard a few stories of freelancer designers getting some of their best clients from their blog. If people can see I'm interested, maybe they will take me more seriously.

I think the thing holding me back the most is fear of failure. My current situation is pretty rough and my job has no room for increase in pay to save up for this. It's the complete lack of a safety net that leaves me feeling fearful and mildly hopeless.

This is probably up to $750 and 15 hours of my time I would lose, when I have many other obligations and paying clients to deal with. Am I morally obligated to do this for her?

I've been doing freelance since 2005, but I've always had the problem of undercharging or doing things as ""favors"" for friends and family, or because it'll be for my ""portfolio"" (they, of course, end up looking like shit with their requests so I'd never show anyone the sites). I have been trying to break this habit, but I have run across something recently that is making me waver.

A few months ago, I started a freelance project with a woman who wanted a website for the books she wrote, as well as the book covers and helping her publish on Amazon. We agreed (and signed a contract with these agreements included) that she would pay a flat rate for the website, and an hourly rate for any of the book work. She paid half the website fee up front, and I finished the design and everything I could. All the site is waiting on currently is the content, which she has not yet sent me.

The project was put on hold for a couple months while I waited for her content. It turns out that she's been sick with something that requires chemotherapy treatment (I don't know exactly what). 

Yesterday, she emailed again, saying she is feeling better and wants to continue the project. She gave me details on what she wants the book covers to look like. I responded and let her know I would be able to do that, but also reminding her of her agreement to pay an hourly rate for this (in this case, the rate was $50 an hour).

She responded with the following:

&gt; Here's my problem, I can find the pics but am too ignorant to be able to capture them and then make them look like the front of a book and how do I put the letters on it. I don't know how.  I wanted a website, a pretty basic one, but don't have the money to pay for extras.  What should I do?

""Extras"" in the above referring to the book covers not included in the original website quote.

While I can afford to give up the money that it would take to do the number of book covers (I estimate it at $400 to $750, depending on how many revisions and how much time), I really can't afford to give up that much time, because I work a full-time job as well as having other freelance customers that I know will pay and that have stricter deadlines.

I just am really torn. I feel really bad for her, being sick and low on money, but at the same time, I need time and money to live on too.

Any ideas?

**Edit/Update:** I ended up emailing her and telling her that I would finish the agreed upon website work, but I would not be doing any of the ""extras"" she claimed that she didn't have the money for. I did go the extra mile and tell her that I'd ask my friends if they wanted to do the work for free, but I doubt any of them are as much of a sucker as me.",,False,,t5_2qhs9,True,,,True,t3_m9rqf,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/m9rqf/rfreelance_i_have_a_moral_dilemma_please_help_me/,

So I think I already prefaced this with the fact that I'm an idiot, but I wanted to share my folly with any other amateurs.

 I was in touch with a band to make a music video, met up with them and their manager...discussed plans for the video and said we would see what happened. Since I was sort of not sure what I was doing for the video (my process is strange), I just decided to make the treatment and not worry about a contract because I wasn't sure if they were going with me yet. 

Then before I know it...we're sort of full steam ahead, and I'm pretty much done with the video. it gets out there..is going to be on a couple channels and stuff which is cool for me. It's not a tiny group.

I keep checking in about getting paid and got an message today saying they will pay me 1/4 of what I asked for, which is barely worth my time. 

This is one of my first hired roles like this, so I am very amateur in my business sense, and I should have been much more careful about what I was doing since i have come to expect flakiness with bands. I had no written contract (I'm going to push for one now so I know what my future rights are with the video) and the only time money was ever discussed was in person or over the phone until I had finished the project of course.

Threats don't seem like they'll get much accomplished...and the only thing I can do is remove the video from a few sites and tell them I'll sure if they use it for anything else and just not get paid at all.

The band is nice, the manager and labels have been nice and agreeable up until this point so I was very trusting that I would get what I deserved...well the lesson is to never trust anyone and get that shit in writing. Now to figure out how to pay my bills....

I've been doing a lot of searching through this and other subreddits and while I've learned a little bit I'm still confused on a few subjects. I'd also like to make sure I'm getting the most up to date info.

Backstory: Just became an LLC in New York City. I don't have much experience in this.

Questions: What should I do about banking? I've seen a mix of responses, ranging from credit unions to big banks to savings vs. checking. I am in NY, so I'm looking for what the best NY bank is (or at least a few suggestions). But it doesn't necessarily have to be NY-based, just figured that was the best place to start.

How does the whole ""paying yourself"" thing work? I've never had to do this before. Do I just deposit my check into my business account and then write myself a check for that amount to my personal account? Do I deposit the first few checks in there and wait to save up first? I really don't get it. 

I know these questions have been asked before but my hope is to maybe start a conversation here so I can really understand it. Also, again, I want to make sure all the info I'm getting is up to date.

The question I have is about contracts and invoicing.

Every country has their law in terms of what a contract and invoice should contain for it to be legally binding. The problem is, this can differ quite a bit between countries. How do you write a contract that's valid in both countries? How do you write an invoice that the client can use for their taxes when their tax law might be different from your own?

The work is interesting, the people are nice, there are plenty of hours and basically I want to do as much work for them as possible.  At the same time, I am trying to hold together some other projects I had already started, as I would like to complete the work.  I'm wondering how other folks manage a favorite client while balancing other clients and jobs as well.

Until now, I've just been putting in crazy hours to work on the existing projects, while giving everything I can to the new client as I establish a relationship with them.  I don't want to straight up ditch my other work for this one client, but I can't continue to work 18-hour days.  The issue I see is that I might find myself taking less ideal work to fill in gaps, then my favorite client might have a new project for me to work on but I've taken on too many jobs already.  My field (architectural visualization) is one where there is not a lot of advance planning that can be done; projects start suddenly and move very quickly.

I'd love to hear some strategies for prioritizing good work while not treating other clients poorly; I know clients can tell when they're not the top priority and while that may be just a fact of life, I'd like to at least formalize some of how I prioritize work.  I have a sense that this is one of the basics of successful freelancing and I'd like to improve in this area.

If it helps, I've been freelancing for about 2 years and things are really picking up, but I have not yet set up any kind of real structure to my practice (mostly because I was not sure if this would even be viable long term).  I did not set out to freelance but fell into it because of lack of job options, and things are now at a point where this may very well become what I do as a career.

I've recently moved from Canada to Germany to pursue a Masters in Computer Science, and I'm currently in Studienvorbereitung, which basically means that I'm learning German and nothing else. This means I'm not legally allowed to work here (not until I start the actual Masters program at least), which is proving to be quite a strain on my finances.

In Canada, I worked for a little over 5 years doing general development in two different start ups. The first one was mostly doing bug fixing and implementation of little features to an existing corporate intranet (mostly PHP/SQL - some MySQL, but also some ODBC stuff with the accounting program); understandable, considering it was my first job. The second one was better, and I started out doing mostly frontend development in JavaScript, where I was involved in every part of the process (design, testing, implementation, etc.). Then some backend stuff (not really web stuff, since this was for embedded devices, so while there was a network component, it wasn't HTTP related), and then again more frontend stuff (although this time, the project lead was an experienced developer, so the application was much more robust).

Now, I'm not legally allowed to work in Germany, so I've been looking around for remote jobs, since my official address is still (for the moment) in Canada. The thing is, I'm not a web designer; I'm actually not terrible at web design, but not great either. Unfortunately, most freelancing jobs I see require you to be both developer and designer, and I can really only do one properly (or at least I only feel confident as a developer). I much prefer an office job, so freelancing would be a temporary thing for me (especially since I'd start my studies in some months).

I'm not sure where to start; I know I don't have the skills to design and implement large scale applications, but I'm pretty confident when it comes to smaller, simpler ones: I feel I was very well mentored by my old supervisor in that aspect. So developing a small to medium sized website and implementing custom features is something I'd feel confident about - except for the design part.

Any advice? Should I give up freelancing at all? Is it possible to find pure development remote jobs that don't ask you to be a ""rockstar"" or ""ninja"" or some other bullshit title? My ideal job would be one where I would be integrated into a team for a determinate amount of time, but honestly I doubt that'd happen.

I'm a math teacher, not a professional artist/designer/developer.

I understand that I can charge by the final product, or charge for time and materials. I think the latter option may be more appropriate (just charging for my time), because I can see that a back-and-forth would be likely to take place with multiple requests for modification.
But one thing I am still uncertain about: someone who is familiar with rights-managed images suggested to me that I license my work with an expiration date, so that if the client wishes to continue to use it after, say, a year, I can generate new revenue from the work by negotiating a renewal of the license.

I know the question of how much to charge is probably too hard to answer, but I would be interested in hearing ideas about what is a proper basis for pricing. Get paid once and give away the work forever? Or get paid on a yearly basis for continued usage of the work?
What confuses me is that I have found that stock photos are sometimes licensed with an expiration date, but generative art images also require considerable labor so maybe they should be thought of differently from licensed photographic images.

Usually my workflow with a new client is talk to them, get an idea about the size / scope of what they want, put together an estimate and *maybe* a mockup and send them a proposal (I hate the word estimate). I suspect this is pretty standard workflow for new clients for all freelancers. 

(I do have limits: if a job is going to take more than 40 hours of work I won't estimate it -- I'm fine with spending an hour or two on an estimate, but bigger than 40 hours of work needs serious conversation with the client on scoping and whatnot.)

When the client signs the invoice, do you bill for the work you did initially (your phone conversation, any work you did pulling together the invoice, etc etc?) Or do you consider this cost of business ?

In one way I can see chalking this up as cost of business - because if the client does *not* sign with me I don't bill for that proposal - but it also seems like a large amount of time for me to eat (If I spent 2 hours talking and putting together a proposal, and send out 10 proposals for every 1 client project I land... seems like I need to get compensated for at least some of those hours).

I do have a clause in my contract about ""all time spent performing services and communicating with the client is billable"", but a client recently debated me billing for work done before the contract was signed.

I'm debating adding ""starting at initial first contact"" to the ""all time..."" clause above, but not sure how kosher that is. There is the point to be made that if the client walks away I don't charge for any of the initial work, so why should a client that signed up?

My biggest role is to edit the site's text content, making the site more easily digestible and more interactive, but he also wants me to chime in on how the site design should look.

I'm really excited about this opportunity, especially for the potential networking I'll be able to do with his partners and other companies he's connected with.  My only problem (or is it a blessing?) is that he asked me how much I want to get paid, but I have no idea what a standard asking price is for work like this.  

Obviously I want to make good money, but I don't want to pitch a ridiculous price.  I know an old employee got $15/hr for some work, but it was all procedural desk work. AFAIK the owner hasn't hired anyone to do a job like the one he's asked me to do (young company, not many employees).

Of course this is my first time doing anything like this, but the business owner knows me and has seen enough writing/editing samples of mine to know he wants me to do the job. I know I'll do a good job, but I don't know how much money I should ask for.

I'm a University student in the UK (aged 21 almost) but I've been freelancing for clients as a web developer since I was 11.

I charge £200 for a wordpress website. Normally this is a pre-built html theme which I program and customise to the clients needs but it can also be a completely new website. I also charge £20 per hour.

I'm crap at the marketing side of things and I've currently got a couple of clients who're being ""difficult"" but I'm looking to improve and sometimes I have good months, sometimes I have bad but this one is the worst I've had yet. It's at the point where I may not be able to continue with my third (and final) year of university in September as I can't even afford to make it that far.

I'm really sorry, this feels like such a selfish post but it seems the best forum for such a query. Here goes....

I am not a Comp Sci major but I have some random IT powers. And I would love to do some freelance work on the side.

I have the following skill set at my disposal:

* Dreamweaver
* HTML
* Adobe Photoshop
* Wordpress

* Visual Basic, some MSSQL and C (LOL)

I'm working on PHP and Joomla right now, then perhaps onto ROR ?

I have also worked on VOIP stuff and know my way around there.

Any opinions (wisecracks are ok as long as they are funny), advice, comments or even more questions are welcome.

Thanks guys !

EDIT 1: firstly, my apologies to Adobe, I feel like I should never touch a computer again for such an error. 

Secondly, thank you all for such in-depth responses, I honestly wasn't expecting so much feedback. Which is why I didn't really elaborate on my skills, nor post any work I have done.

A better question would be **'what skills out of these can I develop to successfully freelance part-time'**

From what I feel right now, I have a lot of scattered skills, and I need to focus and improve on some and drop the rest...


DW- Let's not touch this again

HTML - Short of actually writing out the whole code for a website, I understand what's going on and can make changes where required. I wouldn't call my self a pro, but I'm not 'carpet cleaning website' bad, like [this](http://www.steamedcleanslc.com/). Reminds me of geocities.

Photoshop - Again, I'm not Picasso - I would classify myself at an intermediate level.

WP - I'm not so sure I'll be able to write plugins for WP, but I'm working on making my own themes before I dive headfirst into Joomla!

VB - Same level as Photoshop, the most I've done with VB is write my own macros for excel and create front ends for applications using MS Access databases.

SQL and C - There's no point in mentioning these at all now. I was waiting to see if people said to work on them more or something, but I think they'll require a lot more time commitment to achieve a working level knowledge.

IMO my ideal market would be small business website development (kkania also mentions this in the comments)

I made this some time ago for my school club: [link](http://guelphmsa.ca)

I wanted to make changes to the theme to make it more professional, and some other stuff involving photo albums and videos. But the other board members didn't really want any more changes or features, so I left it at that.
I guess you could call it maybe an hour of work, from downloading WP to what you see right now (including all the text).

Now, onto what I am shooting for. After some hard work, I'll be happy if I can average $200 a month.
 **Do people think that is achievable ?**

What I do. 
What I see as wrong with their current site. 
What I can offer.
An estimate for a ""basic package"".

Companies B C D E get a direct mail piece, but company F gets a small packet catered to what I know they need.

My name is Stacy and I am a longtime Reddit lurker (going back 5+ years I reckon); as well as a professional graphic artist, web designer and UI/UX guru from South Florida.    

You can checkout my website &amp; portfolio here: http://www.friendsof42.com.    

I am currently employed full-time as an Art Director for a local manufacturing company in Ft. Lauderdale, creating advertising, web banners, html newsletters and a host of other shiny things.    

The best thing about my job is that I get to work almost exclusively out of my bat cave and rarely do I have to commute to the office.  This affords me the luxury of taking on the occasional side project.    

This is where you come in.    

I am always on the lookout for side-jobs (and side-boobs, but that's another thread altogether) and so I figured I would give r/freelance a try.  I have over 12 years of experience in the graphic design and printing industries and I excel at turning vague creative briefs into clean, modern, pixel-perfect web designs or various graphics.  Some of my notable clients include: The Philadelphia Parking Authority, Q'Straint Manufacturing, and NFL player Raheem Brock.    

I conduct all of my freelance business online, with contact, proofing and collaboration done over email or Skype chat. My invoices are handled thru Freshbooks and can be paid via Paypal or CC. I am also partnered with industry standards like Basecamp &amp; ConceptShare, if you use those services.  You get the idea.    

**What I Do:**  
- Organized and Annotated .PSD web mockups, ready to slice and code.  Perfect for freelance developers.  
- Vector Logo/Identity/Branding Designs &amp; Custom Illustration.  
- Print Design &amp; Advertising Concepts, Layouts and Pre-Press.  
- Complete Custom Wordpress Theme Design &amp; Coding Packages with my xhtml/css/php expert [buddy &amp; Redditor](http://www.czent.com).   

**What I Don't Do:**  
- No Third Base on the First Date.  
- No Food After Midnight.    

So, if you've got an interesting freelance design job, or know someone who does, let's get in touch!  I am happy to put together quotes, sign nda's, or just shoot the shit with you about your project.  Thank you for your time!

I've been looking into Project Management systems like [BaseCamp](http://www.basecamphq.com), [WorkEtc](http://www.worketc.com) (looks to be the best, only $30 a month per user, doesn't include your clients access), and [activeCollab](http://www.activecollab.com). Actually, what prompted me to take a look at these came when I recently hired a small company to design a logo for one of my clients.

I was given a BaseCamp login ID and I found the process to be quite interesting. Yes, if you're a small team - there really isn't a need for it (1-2 people). However, what it lacks in necessity for a team member, it really does make up for on the clients end.

I was impressed, and if I was impressed - imagine how my clients will feel? I can send invoices, submit proofs, track hours, manage support tickets, timelines, collaborate with whiteboards - share files; set up automatic billing; etc. 

Sure, it's like an email, but it takes that unknown aspect of working with a client through email out of the equation. Sometimes my clients still are using Hotmail, or Yahoo. Their emails to me will often times get caught in the spam filter, or mine will theirs. And, I think it adds a nice mix. If I wanted to bring an artist on board for a project, I just add him as a team member and grant him access to view the project logs in the PMS.

",Jimmysal,10,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/ioghv/it_seems_like_you_guys_deal_mostly_with_web/,"Not actually me per se, but my girlfriend.  She does music transcription. 

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ik2vn/what_to_do_about_my_pennypinching_employer/) is a thread she posted a while back when her current client started giving her problems.  

Here's my take on the situation:

She got referred by a friend to a retiree who needed reams of music transcribed.  Friend used to transcribe the music, but took 2 months per piece and did it at less than 1/3 market price.  

My girl started negotiating a price with the dude, and he said whatever you want is fine.  They settled on $30/hr, which is still slightly below market price.  She turned in the first piece and he paid her without a problem.  He called back shortly complaining about mistakes that weren't actually mistakes, just him complaining about his own idiosyncrasies.  Customer is always right, and she fixed them and logged the hours.  

Then he started whining about his fixed income and started trying to chisel her on the hourly rate.  

Now he's saying he can pay her half of what she's owed for the last piece she did and the other half mid August when he gets his SS check.  

Oh by the way, this dude takes weekly/biweekly trips to Boston, 3.5 hrs. away.  

I told her not to meet with him today, but call him and say ""oh, that's fine, just pay me all of it when you have the money, and I'll give you the piece then.""  I also told her to stop working on his stuff for the time being.  

I read this guy as a total shitbird who's trying to pressure her.  I think if she takes a check and turns over the music to this guy today, she isn't going to see the other 50% of the money she's due.  If she lets him get away with it, he'll only get worse.  

Your thoughts and advice would be appreciated.   

**Update 1:** He called her a little while ago about meeting up.  He wants her to give him the CD of music *yet to be transcribed* back.  He also complained about the quality of the work the previous person he hired, and said she needs to fix it.  

I told her she should give the cd back, but don't surrender the finished piece at this point.  I also told her she doesn't ""need"" to do a god damn thing for him.  It's obvious that he ""needs"" someone to transcribe his music, and while she ""needs"" money it doesn't necessarily have to be his money.  

I'm going to give her a pep talk during lunch and accompany her to meet the guy as moral support.  She'll do all the talking, because it's her business and she needs to learn how to run it.  All I can do is give advice and mentor her based on my business experience.  I'll only step in if he starts getting out of hand.

**Update 2:** They met, and he brought along more work for her to do.  She told him that she wouldn't do any more until he was caught up on paying her.  He complained that the last guy was much cheaper, she told him the price was the price and she's already cheaper than any professional competition.  He said that he'd try to get her the money before the original date he projected.  He drove away upset, and without the music he has yet to pay for.  She went to the library to check out books on freelancing and starting/running a business.  I bet her lunch that he comes up with all the money in a week or so.  

**Update 3:**  Customer called her within 30 minutes of the meeting ending telling her he could have all of the money for services rendered tomorrow.  Called it.  I wonder where she'll take me for lunch?

**Update 4:**  We just spent an hour and a half on the phone with her father (a lawyer and former magistrate) drawing up a contract for the customer to sign tomorrow.  We didn't list checks as an acceptable form of payment because her father and I both got a funny feeling about him post dating or passing bad checks.  Money order, cash, cashier's/bank checks only, and everything will come with a carbon copy receipt.

My question is, how do I keep growing and building on my new chosen role as a freelance.  Is there any good resources to meet others like me that may be willing to offer advice, or chat on a regular basis about problems we face?    

A lot of my questions revolve around how to continue building on my rate and earn more.  I've done a bit of googleing to find what advice I can, but end up usually hitting a wall.  It seems that the topic of finding good clients and setting a rate is usually pretty hush hush, why is that?  Right now I'm at $65/hr as a 1099, soon to be corp to corp.  All the calculations / limited information I've seen out there though seems to point to that being on the low end.

I am looking for a freelance artist/creator to create some art for me. Me and a good friend have a pretty unique relationship and were always sending each other ""quirky gifts"" randomly in the post. I just received a custom apron with a picture of her on the front. Not one to be out done i want to send her something back. She also is completely down at the moment and going through a bad time, so i wish to cheer her up.

I am looking for two things really.

A) A detailed penciled drawing of her (a picture i will provide) one thats tasteful and accurate.

B) This is a little more creative, I'm looking for someone to design or draw a series of pictures to make a rather large flip book (no bigger than A5). I will provide the ""story and scenes"" i just need someone to draw it for me in a flip book. I'd like the artist to have an open mind with this as we tend to send each other naughty stuff, so the content might be sexual.

As mentioned i would love to pay you guys/girls for your time and effort, i guess my intentions here would be for people to ask further on what i want, or provide any links to work they can do.

I am not looking for a Picasso, just simple pencil work. Unfortunately my hands and brain cannot draw no matter how many times i try to teach myself.

Let me know guys, the deadline for the work would be by the end of april. (its her b'day in may)

Oh i guess the obvious question would be how much im willing to pay, kinda hard to say without having an overall goal, but looking to spend about £30-50 for your hard earned hands.

Thanks for hearing me out, and let me know if i should post this elsewhere.

He set up a website that displayed all of his work, including those done for said previous employer, however they are now threatening him with legal action, and have set up re-directs to a page that publically accuses him of copywrite infingement if you click through to any of the sites on his portfolio.

I currently work with WojoScripts' self-hosted Freelance Manager app (http://www.wojoscripts.com/fm.php). I mostly really like it: it offers excellent integrated invoicing and payment, helps manage workflow and approval processes, and it lets clients have their own accounts to login to and share files, get a sense of where projects are at, report problems, etc. Really solid overall. 
 
However, there's one thing that's annoyed me about Freelance Manager and almost every other Project Management software I've found: the lack of ability to create recurring projects and tasks! Or even just useful project templates or reusable task sets. In FM, for example, I can create 'Project Templates' and 'Task Templates', but these are less 'templates' and more, um, 'titles and associated descriptions'. There are a lot of tasks that I do pretty regularly or do every time I work on a certain sort of project, and it would be great if I could find an app that let me package oft-used related tasks together, either by associating them with a project template or task set, having them automatically recur, or both. 
 
Any advice on where to look for something like this? I strongly prefer something self-hosted and with a similar overall functionality as Freelance Manager. 
 
Thanks, 
A. 
 
EDIT: I'm thinking that having tasks associated with a project template might be preferable thing, because it'd be great if I could have the tasks attached to a project template come with due dates that update in relation to the overall expected completion date of the project - so if I know that a something should be completed by about six weeks before launch time, I can build that in to the template and only tweak the timing if the project needs it.

How much should I charge? Thinking $20/hour, but I feel like I could and should be charging more, though I need to start getting jobs first before I do that right?

How do I get more clients?
Saw a helpful post so I'm definitely going to try and get my own page on a community site for now, and possibly dedicated website when I can afford it.

Business cards-
 Should I get business cards even though I don't have a website and just put my contact info along with link to demo reel? My demo reel is on YouTube which seems a little unprofessional. Friend Vimeo but the file was too big

How do I quote someone- 
Do I just give them my hourly rate and give a rough idea of how long I think it will take but remind them it can possibly take more time?

How do I structure payment -
Do I ask for a down payment, or only get paid when job is finished? Currently I've only been paid after the job is complete, but my latest client keeps wanting changes and its already been forever. Just hoping I can avoid this situation in the future where I am working n a project with no end in sight and still haven't been paid.

I don't do discounts, and I honestly can't afford to do gratis work anymore. It would be easy for me to tell anyone else that I need money to do work, but since she is a buddy... I find the topic a little difficult to broach. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you deal?

*As an additional note, her business is growing but I don't think she has turned a profit yet. Just something to consider since my usual rate isn't exactly peanuts.

I met with the prospects one time just to chat about my background and what they need in high-level terms. We talked for about two hours.

Then at a meeting about a week later, I signed an NDA and we spent about two hours walking through details.

The web app will replace a home-grown spreadsheet + visual basic spiderweb that helps industrial manufacturing product managers do better product planning and analysis.

These guys have been using this spreadsheet tool for years and have trained hundreds of customers.  It is very complex, not just because of macros stacked on top of macros.  The workflows they are modelling are not trivial.

We all agreed that it would be tricky to estimate this project in any honest manner up front because they're going to need to explain stuff along the way.  So, the best way to go would be to work in iterations where I bill for two weeks of work at a time, and we could revisit the to-do list at the beginning of each iteration.

Anyhow, here's where I want advice: Monday, I sent them a proposal describing my hourly rate and a commitment to work on this project for XX hours each week.

I really want to do this project!  It matches my skillset very well.  I have to stop myself from already starting to write code.  I keep checking email compulsively waiting for a response.


I suspect that the prospects are just really busy running their business and my proposal is just one of many things going on.


Talk to me about how / if / when I should email the prospect and ask if they're in.

More generally, any advice about how I engaged this prospect is welcome.  This is not my first freelance project, but I am still a rookie.

**UPDATE**: sent a one-sentence email to prospect saying something like ""we're interested in this project and I'm checking in to see if there's anything in the proposal you want to discuss.""

Got a fast reply; they're on the road and they'll get in touch next week.

Thanks for the encouragement everyone!

Editing together footage of bands announcing that they're playing the festival with live footage. (3-5 videos)

Filming and editing 1 or 2 songs per set (10-15 videos)

Filming and editing a little behind the scenes/recap of the festival video w/ interviews

needing some feedback on what you think the pricing should be for an app i'm about to take on. can't talk about it too much detail-wise b/c of an nda, but i'll beat around the ol' bush.

two main user types, the suppliers and the supplied. each see things differently. the goal is to hook them up together by way of competitive deals/offers. based on information uploaded and parsed by the supplied the suppliers will be able to see who they should make deals for. the supplied will see these offers/suggestions upon login as well as graphs showing/comparing their different departments and their spending on certain products.

sharing offers with others in your network, seeing who is using similar ones, etc. is all possible. creating types of users within a user (super admin, admin, users, etc.). linkedin type of social interaction with peers, reviews, etc. suppliers will be able to enter all sorts of data for the offers. make broad offers, specific/targeted ones, and the likes.

it's a BIG project. i won't be doing it all up front, just the most basic things to get a good pitching unit available.
what are your thoughts on a payment based on phase(s) or the project as a whole? or should we just do hourly with a projection per phase?

Looking for advice. ,00spool,8,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/y84el/negotiating_with_former_employer_to_go_full_time/,"This might run a bit long, but I feel people might need some background in order to give me proper advice.  

I have about 14 years design experience. I started working for a new company in 2004. 

In December 2009 they had to cut back and laid me off. I was told that I was laid off because they felt I would be able to handle freelance work from home for them. So I have been freelancing for them for about 2 1/2 years. In that time, not counting my other much smaller clients I have averaged $44,489 (gross) and about 800 billable hrs per year solely from them. 2011 was a bad year and dragged the average way down. Over the long run I would imagine the average would be closer to 50K. 

So now they have decided to start hiring again and have offered me a full time position (40 hr week), with benefits and I can continue to work from home. I was told my workload would significantly increase. The offer was 50,000 per year. I tried to negotiate to 57K and they are standing firm at 50K.  

If I were to decline the offer, I would most likely continue to receive freelance work from them while they look for an in-house designer. Finding someone with my skills and in this industry could take some time. It's an exhibit design company. Half of my job involves designing 2d graphics and creating production files. The other half is producing 3d renderings of exhibits.  Most of their applicants don't do both 2d and 3d or don't have industry experience. So I figure I would have that time to build other clients.  

Unfortunately, I don't have much confidence in my ability to get enough clients to meet my current income. I've never considered myself a ""real"" freelancer since I get the majority of my income from one client and they are a former employer. I don't know if I can really do it.   

At this point I'm unsure what to do. Trying to get new clients would be a pain...The average salaries for my position in my area are around 65,500. I really want to continue to work from home, but the 50k seems really low...of course not many are going to offer telecommuting. I guess I feel like I have it pretty good, but it could be better. I just can't believe they didn't even try to meet me halfway on salary.

I've got a very promising offer from an established company overseas for 3 months worth of work with payments made on the 5th of every month (my terms, not theirs)

My contact for the company is here in the states and he is a contract producer with them. With all of our initial talks, I had figured I would be dealing mainly with him and he would present all work to the client. Which is basically how it's going to go.  We're drawing up a contract now, and I asked him for the legal name of the company I would be paid by, to include as the ""Client"" in my contract.  He gave me the company name and address overseas. 

Now before I state this, I've done the research on the company and it's a legitimate operation. He has work that he's shown that has been done for them as well.  The company is in West Africa. 

I've been freelancing full-time for about a year now, and I always make sure I have a tight simple contract to make sure my working relationships are solid.  I have not worked with an international company before, and I'm wondering how solid my contract can be. Am I able to hold the company to the terms of my contract even though they are not in the U.S.?

What would be my recourse if they decide not to pay after the first month and the contract specifically stated they are required to pay for the additional 2 months?

Feels like they could just drop off the map and not be very contactable for following up on payments.  

The contract isn't for a ""ton"" of money, but it will keep my family supported for a few months, so it's important to me.

I've got a BA in Philosophy and Literature and an MA in literature and cultural theory. I'm currently a doctoral student. Since the early 90s my passion and, until now, hobby has been designing for the web. I started making pages for local businesses when I was 13 and have always kept up to date with CSS/HTML and other languages related to web development. After a few helpless weeks I decided to turn this passion into an occupation.

I'm living in Germany, but any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

* Does my skill set (research, writing, teaching experience, time management, communication, etc.) combine well with any (or, a specific) field of web development?

* I don't think another Bachelor's degree is necessarily the right move for me, is there another path I can take to becoming certified or employable in the field?

* Is there an occupation I could strive towards with my current education that I'm overlooking?

Also when I mentioned to him the amount of money I have brought the company in terms of my web work that I feel like I'm a little bit underpaid (just over minimum wage, I wasn't initially his web guy but once he found out I could do it he was all over me) I got a written warning for asking for a bit of a raise.

Freelancing is something I have been wanting to get into for a long time now but I seem to lack the balls to basically say ""fuck you job, I can do this myself and be better off for it!"". I like the security of a steady wage, I guess.

So how do I man up and make this transition to something I know will ultimately make me much happier and better off in life?

I'm looking to pass on some work to a decent yet reasonable designer (I know, I sound like my own worst client) to work on a specific project to start, and hopefully long term as we often have design work needing done.

In short, my better half has an electronic music related website - [beatsmedia](http://beatsmedia.com), and does promotional style work + reviews and interviews for DJs and artists. Typical work ranges from featured images for the homepage, through to newsletter design.

The first job involves creating six digital ""flyers"" (700x900px static images) for artists to essentially say ""vote for me"" in the DJMag Top 100. Nothing too challenging, yet it does take an eye for design and due to the market, can't really be too old school. Rate will be 25EURO each, 150EURO in total for the six - payment always via paypal upon completion.

Do get in touch if you think you'd like to work with us.

aside: I'm a developer and also need design work done on projects for my clients from time to time, so really, both me and my partner just need to know a couple of good designers to pass work on to / call on from time to time.

Best,

Please, comments &gt; votes, I'd love to hear what I'm doing wrong/right


So, on with the post:

You should know

 - I am a young entrepreneur looking at getting a project developed
 - This is remote work, and this is only one project. It isn't a big budget or long lasting thing, but it is something that you will hopefully find a cool project.

Even if you aren't interested, I would hugely appreciate an email (chris@username.com) or message with the price you would do it for if you were interested, or if you were willing to take on a small project etc, just so I know how much I am going to need to invest and how easily I can make this profitable. Thanks :)



**Project #1 (Web App)**

btw - if you use emacs and org-mode, copy this into org-mode -- that is what I wrote it in

The basic premise is this:

 - An interactive quiz tool that asks the user questions
 - Based on the users answers, at the end of the quiz a user is presented with an 'item' that suits them best!
 - The best way I can think of doing this is having each answer associated with a +/- number for each item
   - E.g. Have you seen the movie Spiderman? Yes. Did you like it? Yes: +500 Spiderman 3, +500 Spiderman 2, +100 The Amazing Spider-Man, all others unchanged
   - And then at the end, it shows the item with the highest points
Check out a super-simple demo I made on Heroku. I can't post links, but it is located at http://evening-mist-407.heroku.com/surveys

A bit more detail
 - I would like to have a way of generating new apps on different topics, by inputting:

   - questions
   - answers
   - items
     - including info, links, pics
   - answer ratings (yes: +100 for x, +500 for y, -100 for z)
   - answer explanations (shown after each inputted answer. If you liked Spiderman 1, you are more likely to like Spiderman 3., or you are less likely to like movie X as people who like spiderman tend not to like z)
 - Features
   - Most likely a part of the MVP
     - mailchimp integration to get updates on other 'surveys' (call them cfys) or the topic of the cfy (e.g. superhero movie news)
       - later version: ability to intersplice random questions like 'would you be interested in a cfy for action movies'
     - ability to get a direct link to share your result page (build in twitter+fb buttons)
       - the shared page will show the winning item, along with answer choices and answer explanations
What I would love to know from you
 - How capable you would be of doing this
 - What would you use to build this? Rails works well for me as I love heroku
 - What is your hourly rate? Sorry to ask this, my age does limit my budget.
 - Can you give any sort of estimate on the time required for a basic version? And maybe the time for some of the features? Sorry to ask for this, as I know it can be difficult to estimate but it would be hugely appreciated.
 

**Project #2**

iOS apps

App #1 is a progress picture tracker for people into fitness, tracking their skin, whatever.

App #2 is a jailbroken app, pretty simple one, it just appends to and modifies one existing file in the iOS filesystem, and allows users to put a password and time lock on the modification of that file.

As above, please let me know what your hourly rate would be, and a time estimate for each of the apps (a basic version).

 

 

Looking forward to hearing from you :)

* Do I need to or should I get a separate tax id?
* Should I register as a business (LLC or otherwise)?
* Do I have to get a separate account freelance income (or is this just helpful)?
* Any sort of insurance I need to start paying as a *business*?
* Is there a hard percentage that I'm going to be require to pay, or is it on some sort of sliding scale?

I have a bit of a paperwork aversion, so I get a little anxious about checking the wrong box, declaring things incorrectly, etc. A couple of jobs ago, I had an employer decide towards the end (part of my reason for leaving) that he wanted to pay me as a freelance consultant, and not have taxes withdrawn, but only on occasion and without telling me. I would get a handwritten check (a coworker and I called it birthday money because it was like getting a birthday check from the angry Italian father we never had) with claims that the payroll company we were using was being replaced. Come tax season, I ended up having to pay tax on that ""freelance"" income with no warning. The whole thing left me a little soured towards freelance work and I felt cheated out of money (which I probably was in that case). I don't want to be shocked this year or end up having to scramble for money I don't have.

Some of you might be familiar with my past ""walls of text"" responses in /freelance and it got me thinking that perhaps I could put something a bit more all-inclusive together for everyone asking the same sort of questions. 

There goes without saying that I'm certain someone else has already done this ~ and that's awesome. I'm offering my experience and telling  my story, what's worked &amp; what hasn't and why.

Ok, so far I've got the following topics and I wanted to see if there was anything else I might be missing that new or aspiring freelancers would want some feedback on.

1. How do you find clients / customers / projects?
2. What should you charge?
3. Dealing with clients (contracts, angry/unhappy, non-paying, etc)
4. Properly marketing yourself and your services
5. Creating a marketing system to get repeat and referral business
6. Avoiding the most common mistakes
7. Keeping your freelance from taking over the rest of your life
8. Tactics to increase productivity
9. Awesome resources (free and paid)
10. Making it big time from freelancing (how to build a legitimate business)

I’m most of the way through all the above topics, and I've been around enough to know that this will cover a majority of the questions that typically come up. After investing so much time, I didn't want to neglect any popular questions or issues, so I ask you all … anything else you think I should include that would address common issues or questions?

Once the work is finalized, I’ll be back to post the link to the free PDF.

I formally terminated the contract.  I just don't feel the project will be a good use of my time due to the unreliable pay situation and the unethical use of other brand's products.  I told them as much in as professional a manner as possible.  I outlined that they are not to use my name in connection to any future work they do, regardless of whether they settle the outstanding bill, and that they don't have permission to use any work obtained thus far until the bounced check and full balance due are satisfied with a cashiers check.  They won't receive any of the work completed for this week until the balance is settled either.  There may be a shitstorm, but I'd rather weather that than continue working with them.  Thank  you to all who shared their opinions and insights!  

One odd note, I did find out that in the fashion industry, people who try to use formal contracts are seen as outsiders and amateurs, imposing other creative industry's standards on this industry.  People operate out of reputation and simple pricing agreements.  I think that's crazy, but a professor I talked to told me she knew things weren't going to work out as soon as I said there was a contract involved.  Its a crazy old world.

________________________________________-
I asked in /r/design last night and got some good insight; someone there directed my attention here, so I thought I'd try to get my thoughts on this issue into better format and try here as well.  Thanks for reading!

I have a contract with a start up swimwear company to design their debut collection.  Its a big job but they have more dreams than money, and I have more skill than experience, so this could be a good arrangement for us.  I gain more experience and get a little bit of pay, they take another step towards their dream of being moguls.  I love doing swimwear, so this should be a fun job for me.  

A little background about me: I'm finishing up what will be my last semester at a great design school.  I won't be graduating as 1)this would have been a 2nd degree and I don't really care about getting a design degree, just skills, 2)I've been allowed to leapfrog a lot of prerequisites designed for degree seeking students and have nearly exhausted all the studio classes available, which I've done very well in, 3)I'm pregnant and do feel ready to move ahead with life, but ideally at my own pace.  I've been in the workforce before and I'm just ready to move ahead with a new design career.  I'm super self motivated and until this contract came along, I had been working at developing my own activewear/lifestyle collection.

The contract is super simple.  Too simple, and I have since learned a lot about what should be included.  It basically just covers what is due at each deadline, and a bi-weekly pay schedule.

Since signing, there have been several red flags.  Every meeting has to be rescheduled.  The are intensely focused on their debut party and fashion show, both of which have already been scheduled before anything has been developed.  They increasingly reveal how little they know about the fashion industry, they seem to think its all about fashion shows...which the industry is increasingly treating as superfluous.  A nice thing to do if you can, but only one of many options for promotion.

And then the crazy started to unfold.  At one point they casually asked me for the first major deliverable over a month early for some photoshoot unrelated to this line, but would be cool to have some of their pieces in.  I said that their request was crazy, as we hadn't even gotten through one round of sketches yet, so a month was not sufficient time to finalize sketches, select colors and materials, pattern and sew everything up, especially at the rate they were paying.  We had agreed to a specific rate and specific pacing to reflect that.  If find out 2 weeks later the purpose of the shoot is to promote the new label.  They apparently planned on putting the models in simple swimwear purchased from god knows where!!!!  So his initial request 2 weeks prior turned out to be a bit of a stretch of the truth. I have not seen the result of this shoot.  When I found out the full plan it was the day before it was meant to happen, and I found out with one of the models present and couldn't say much.  I just weakly suggested that they consider photoshopping the other swimwear out and putting in their logo blazed across their bodies.  I don't know if they followed my advice or if their graphic designer came up with some kind of solution that does not involve promoting a brand new swimwear line featuring a different brand's swimwear.  This guy is a relentless self-promoter and seems to believe that inflating titles makes a difference.  He keeps referring to me as the line's creative director, which is just ridiculous and now I'm starting to feel like no matter the quality of work I do, their insane business decisions will ultimately be an embarrassment to the whole project and I don't want my name associated with that.

And now pay.  They paid me the first installment.  The 2nd due date comes and goes.  I remind them a week later.  They say oops, we'll write you a check covering the 2nd and 3rd installment when we meet next week.  Fine.  They give me the check, and last night I discovered it bounced.  I call them, and after some research he says he accidentally used the company's new savings account check instead of the expense account check.  I guess I could understand the mixup, and I do think he intends to pay me, but at this point without anything in the contract outlining what would happen as the result of delinquent or missed payments, I wonder if I should just get out now.

We're due this week to do final selections/small refinement so I can move forward with patterning and making samples.  I would be happy to give them the sketches and concept work in exchange for what they owe me thus far, and wash my hands of the whole thing.",,False,,t5_2qhs9,1365611110.0,,,True,t3_1bzkvk,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1bzkvk/at_a_crossroads_with_a_project_could_use_some/,

So, my question is: what do you guys think of adding a clause in the contract similar to doctor's offices where ""please notify 24 hours in advance of a meeting cancellation or a small fee will be applied to your final invoice"". I don't think anyone is purposefully being rude, but if I'm going to have an hour wasted (especially if I drive), I want to be compensated.

Paying $x/h to an employee is not the same as paying $x/h to a contractor right? Also, I realize I need to factor in the costs of the benefits I can't get because I'm self-employed (e.g., vacation, sick days, pension, insurance, etc.).

I've already learned to sell myself by pointing out that a client can save money by paying for work as needed, albeit at a higher rate. My overhead is very low as a guy who sits on a computer at home all day and doesn't need expensive software.

For example, if hiring a full-time employee would cost a company US$50k/year in salary, approximately how much would the total annual cost (including overhead and taxes) of having that employee be? How do I factor that into my rate?

To complicate things further, my clients and target market are not in the US--they're mostly in East Asia--so I really have no idea about employment costs and regulations in those countries. Furthermore, I should note my skills are not something they can usually hire locally for, meaning would need to sponsor an employee for a work visa, further adding to their costs.

Finally, I should note that I plan to incorporate soon and subcontract work mostly to Canadians and Americans as I'm reaching saturation and see huge opportunities for growth (yay!), so my (corporation's) rates are eventually going to have to account for my overhead, profit, and labor costs.

I'm unsure of what to ask for and I'd like some advice. In the past I've done three or four other album designs, but most have been for friends or smaller bands. Does anyone have any advice on how to come up with a reasonable rate / can share what they've charged in the past for similar projects?

A bit more info in case anyone is interested in helping:
 
* I'll be doing the artwork and the layout for two albums. They'll most likely be jewel cases, but they're open to the idea of digipacks as well. They want me to send them a rate for a jewel case with an 8-page layout inside, and one for a 4-page layout.

* I'm also struggling with how to charge them for additional edits. Since it isn't on a per-hour basis, when do changes to the art stop becoming part of the job and start becoming extra work that I should get paid extra for?

* Most of the panels will be photography with minor editing, the real heavy design work will be on the covers of the albums and of course all the text work.

* The last album I did was for a financially struggling band. I charged them $500 for a design / layout. I feel like even $1,000 for a major artist is selling myself short per album, but at the same time I don't want to spook away the artist / these albums are solo albums and won't be promoted through a major label.

1351492575.0,5,self.freelance,129ii9,Took the plunge from freelance to entrepreneur. Set up a landing page and generated some leads. What now? [x-post from /r/entrepreneur],twelvis,5,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/129ii9/took_the_plunge_from_freelance_to_entrepreneur/,"I'm selling scientific copyediting and proofreading services. I've been doing this as a freelancer for almost 3 years, but almost exclusively as a subcontractor.

To validate my idea, I created a simple landing page with unbounce and set up a modest targeted Adword campaign. Here's my landing page. It's my first, so I'm open to criticism (I'm neither a dev nor a designer; I've done the whole wantrepreneur thing in the past and have been freelancing long enough to not get defensive, so pull no punches please). I know I need to create more and take advantage of unbounce's split testing feature.

In 3 days for $20/day on Adwords, I've gained, 404 unique visitors and 23 leads (Mailchimp email subscription), although maybe 30-40% appear to be junk/redundant. I predict the average sale to be $250. My goal is to have my site generating $2000/mo in sales within 1 year.

My questions are:

1) Would you say I've validated my idea even though I haven't made any sales yet? Is it worth investing in a properly designed site now, or should I make due for a while with landing pages and a simple Wordpress site until I get some cashflow? I already make a living income doing this on the side as a subcontractor and have 1-2 years of runway if needed.

2) How do I qualify my leads? What are some questions I can ask?

3) Once I qualify my leads, how do I go about trying to sell my service without being too pushy? My clients might not need my service immediately; most clients will only need to hire me a few times a year.

4) Any other advice for building a business like mine?

Thanks for your help!

I've currently making a living income doing freelance editing in a niche field. However, contrary to the true nature of freelancing, virtually all my work is subcontracted from a single editing company. Although they are an awesome client and I am more than making ends meet working with them alone, I'm essentially getting paid $1 for every $1-2 they take in; in other words, I'm ""paying"" them 50-66% of the revenue to find clients. Furthermore, they know how important a client they are, so they have a lot more bargaining power. In short, I want to cut out the middleman and start my own business.

Challenges:
How do I get enough clients? To make things more complicated, my target clients don't speak English. I don't have any technical skills or know much about adword, SEO, etc. beyond basics.

Strategy (feel free to cut it to ribbons if necessary):
-Create a simple landing page (thinking of using unbounce.com) in multiple languages offering service and collecting leads. 
-Create a PPC ad campaign on Google and other foreign search engines. 
-Start off manually emailing clients, then pay for leads from a market research company. 
-Exercise my own network, although I think the results will be limited.

One of them is that while I'm freelancing I basically never seem to get any work on personal programming projects done. Whenever I'm in the mood to code, I end up working on one of the paid projects that I have, thinking to myself ""well, I might as well be earning some money"".

Pretty much the only time I get to work on personal code is when I'm starving for work, and I'm usually pretty stressed out right about then. This wasn't really the case back when I held a desk job, a job I could leave at the office, and I feel like it has been stunting my growth as a programmer. 

I have tried specifically setting aside time each week for personal projects, but even then I find myself, at some emotional level, feeling like its ""a very expensive hobby"" since I could be doing those as billable hours. 

Does anyone else feel like they are struggling with a similar problem? Has anyone found a solution to it?

I should mention- I am a designer/art director that does both digital and print work.

My issue is, I've been freelancing full-time for about 2 months and I find that I have two types of clients approaching me for work. 1. Businesses that typically hire freelancers (agencies, larger companies that don't need full time designers) and 2. Small businesses that expect to work with a 'company' and don't fully understand that a freelancer fits their needs just fine.

I feel like my marketing identity almost needs to take two completely different roads and split up. I want to work with small businesses but I don't want to come off as deceitful when they find out it is just me. Small businesses also expect me to handle a lot more marketing as opposed to just design which I typically don't pursue but I do some for my current clients. Stuff like copy-writing, direct mail campaigns, e-mail blasts, coupons, etc. 

My web presence now is just completely based on me being a freelancer. But when a current client introduces me to a potential client and says ""he is the founder of blahblahblah"" how do I handle that? Yes, I have an LLC but I am the sole employee. I do hire fellow freelancers for stuff like photography and backend dev but I work out of my house. I don't feel like a founder. 


My question to you is: Do you market yourself as just yourself or do you market yourself as an operation? Have you switched and seen benefits or downfalls of either? My fear is that I am going to lose business by not advertising myself as something larger than a freelancer (complete with marketing services) but at the same time I don't want to scare off the other agencies that I work for by marketing myself as their competitor.

1366054602.0,5,self.freelance,1ceq36,"Biggest freelancing challenges redux - data organized, let's talk ideas and solutions",jackdempsey,5,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1ceq36/biggest_freelancing_challenges_redux_data/,"I grouped the challenges mentioned here http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1c1j0b/what_is_your_biggest_challenge_as_a_freelancer/ and laid out a simple graph: http://lucidcontracts.com/challenges

A couple observations:

1. No surprise, finding good clients ranks at the top. This is a challenge at all levels of experience, though it does get easier over time so don't lose hope junior freelancers. 

2. With just a small number of responses there are still 15 mostly distinct challenges listed. Anyone who is considering freelancing should take note of that. There are some amazing benefits to freelancing, but you can see there are a whole host of different things to deal with as well. 

3. The issues span both hard and soft skills, with the latter being the dominant grouping. I find that interesting and in line with my own experience. It's not the programming or doing of the actual job that's often the hardest, but all the meta aspects surrounding it. 

So I wonder what can be done? Some of these challenges are basically just things you get better at handling the longer you do this. Others seem like some specific tools and networks could help improve, even if only a decent bit. 

For instance, I'm often offered work I can't take on. I'm sure that's the same for others here. At the same time there are obviously many others looking for work...so the trick is building a good connection in the middle. That requires a small number of things, but they're non-negotiable: trust, easy/simple method of forwarding projects, and if it's going to be a subcontract type relationship, a clean way of managing the red-tape/admin aspect of it all. 

For the other challenges that are mostly about gaining knowledge and experience, I wonder if we can't do better. Forums such as r/freelance have a good amount of knowledge and many experienced contributors, but sometimes it feels the overall net result is suboptimal. Maybe it's answering the same questions again and again, maybe it's the restrictions of the reddit platform...maybe this is just really hard stuff and not solvable, but I can't believe it's not improvable.


So, a couple questions:

1. To those who have the softer problems: finding inspiration, learning about client management, billing, and rates--what have you done to improve these skills? What's worked well, what hasn't? Any possible solutions that you wish someone would build?

2. To the challenge of finding good clients: sites like elance/odesk/etc are hopeless for many for obvious reasons. What about flipping it on it's head: connect with other freelancers and only we can post jobs. There's a whole suite of challenges of course, but I'm curious if someone put together a more private network that would keep spam and $5/hour gigs out, help you find other freelancers and clients, if that'd be of interest? 

3. Have any of you used sites like https://grouptalent.com/main/employers http://www.folyo.me etc? Seems there's a bit of a newer wave in these sites, though they don't have widespread recognition or adoption.

To be clear, the next post in this series isn't ""and here's my site that does all this"". I've thought about this over the years like many of you, and am mostly just curious why it doesn't exist and interested in chatting about it. It feels like there are two sides that'd love to meet each other, the challenge is just in the middle bit. 

Anyway, love to hear some thoughts and discussion.
